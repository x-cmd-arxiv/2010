cluster (GC) systems of the edge-on spiral galaxies NGC891 and NGC4013. We used
the 10' x 10' Minimosaic Imager to observe the galaxies in BVR filters to
projected radii of ~20 kpc from the galaxy centers. We combined the WIYN data
with archival and published data from WFPC2 and ACS on the Hubble Space
Telescope to assess the contamination level of the WIYN GC candidate sample and
to follow the GC systems further in toward the galaxies' centers. We
constructed radial distributions for the GC systems using both the WIYN and HST
data. The GC systems of NGC891 and NGC4013 extend to 9+/-3 kpc and 14+/-5 kpc,
respectively, before falling off to undetectable levels in our images. We use
the radial distributions to calculate global values for the total number (N_GC)
and specific frequencies (S_N and T) of GCs. NGC4013 has N_GC = 140+/-20, S_N =
1.0+/-0.2 and T = 1.9+/-0.5; our N_GC value is ~40% smaller than a previous
determination from the literature. The HST data were especially useful for
NGC891, because the GC system is concentrated toward the plane of the galaxy
and was only weakly detected in our WIYN images. Although NGC891 is thought to
resemble the Milky Way in its overall properties, it has only half as many GCs,
with N_GC = 70+/-20, S_N = 0.3+/-0.1 and T = 0.6+/-0.3. We also calculate the
galaxy-mass-normalized number of blue (metal-poor) GCs in NGC891 and NGC4013
and find that they fall along a general trend of increasing specific frequency
of blue GCs with increasing galaxy mass. Given currently available resources,
the optimal method for studying the global properties of extragalactic GC
systems is to combine HST data with wide-field, ground-based imaging with good
resolution. The results here demonstrate the advantage gained by using both
methods when possible.

TTauri star ThA 15-28 (aka Th 28). Spectra were obtained with VLT/ISAAC for the
slit both perpendicular and parallel to the flow to examine jet kinematics and
gas physics within the first arcsecond from the star. The jet was successfully
detected in both molecular and atomic lines. The H_2 component was found to be
entirely blueshifted around the base of the bipolar jet. It shows that only the
blue lobe is emitting in H_2 while light is scattered in the direction of the
red lobe, highlighting an asymmetric extinction and/or excitation between the
two lobes. Consistent with this view, the red lobe is brighter in all atomic
lines. Interestingly, the jet was detected not only in [Fe II], but also in Br
gamma and Pa beta lines. Though considered tracers mainly of accretion, we find
that these high excitation hydrogen permitted lines trace the jet as far as 150
AU from the star. This is confirmed in a number of ways: the presence of the
[Fe II] 2.13 micron line which is of similarly high excitation; H I velocities
which match the jet [Fe II] velocities in both the blue and red lobe; and high
electron density close to the source of >6x10^4 cm^-3 derived from the [Fe II]
1.64,1.60 micron ratio. These near-infrared data complement HST/STIS optical
and near-ultraviolet data for the same target which were used in a jet rotation
study, although no rotation signature could be identified here due to
insufficient angular resolution. The unpublished HST/STIS H alpha emission is
included here along side the other H I lines. Identifying Br gamma and Pa beta
as tracers of ejection is significant because of the importance of finding
strong near-infrared probes close to the star, where forbidden lines are
quenched, which will help understand accretion-ejection when observed with high
spatial resolution instruments such as VLTI/AMBER.

mode could exist at low temperatures, corresponding to a counter-flow of the
superconducting condensates in each band. Here, the theory of electronic Raman
scattering in a superconductor by Klein and Dierker (1984) is extended to a
multiband superconductor. Raman scattering creates particle/hole pairs. In the
relevant $A_{1g}$\ symmetry, the attraction that produces pairing necessarily
couples excitations of superconducting pairs to these p/h excitations. In the
Appendix it is shown that for zero wave vector transfer $% q$ this coupling
modifies the Raman response and makes the long-range Coulomb correction null.
The 2-band result is applied to MgB$_{2}$ where this coupling activates
Leggett's collective mode. His simple limiting case is obtained when the
interband attractive potential is decreased to a value well below that given by
LDA theory. The peak from Leggett's mode is studied as the potential is
increased through the theoretical value: With realistic MgB$_{2}$\ parameters,
the peak broadens through decay into the continuum above the smaller ($\pi $
band) superconducting gap. Finite $q$ effects are also taken into account,
yielding a Raman peak that agrees well in energy with the experimental result
by Blumberg \textit{et el.} (2007). This approach is also applied to the $q=0$,
2-band model of the Fe-pnictides considered by Chubukov \textit{et al.}(2009).

been earlier analyzed on the basis of a memory functions formalism (MFF).
Information measures of memory as well as relaxation parameters revealed high
individuality and unique features in the neuromagnetic brain responses of each
subject. The current paper demonstrates new capabilities of MFF by studying
cross-correlations between MEG signals obtained from multiple and distant brain
regions. It is shown that the MEG signals of healthy subjects are characterized
by well-defined effects of frequency synchronization and at the same time by
the domination of low-frequency processes. On the contrary, the MEG of a
patient is characterized by a sharp abnormality of frequency synchronization,
and also by prevalence of high-frequency quasi-periodic processes. Modification
of synchronization effects and dynamics of cross-correlations offer a promising
method of detecting pathological abnormalities in brain responses.

covers the transverse momentum interval $0.45 < p_{\rm{t}} < 1.05$ GeV/$c$ and
rapidity $|y| < 0.5$. The ratio is measured to be $R_{|y| < 0.5} = 0.957 \pm
0.006 (stat.) \pm 0.014 (syst.)$ at $0.9$ TeV and $R_{|y| < 0.5} = 0.991 \pm
0.005 (stat.) \pm 0.014 (syst.)$ at $7$ TeV and it is independent of both
rapidity and transverse momentum. The results are consistent with the
conventional model of baryon-number transport and set stringent limits on any
additional contributions to baryon-number transfer over very large rapidity
intervals in pp collisions.

phases 1) Preliminary Data Collection- During this phase sink node collects
enough data so that it can build up ARIMA model for each node. Then sink node
selects a model for the particular node and sends back the corresponding model
parameters to the node and also keeps them with it. Selecting the model for a
node there is a tradeoff between energy consumption and accuracy of prediction.
So we choose the model according to C = {\alpha} xMAE + (1 - {\alpha}) x rtran
0=< {\alpha} =<1 where the model should minimize C. Here MAE is Mean Absolute
Error which is normalized by some predefined error tolerance and rtran is the
ratio of number of samples transmitted over total number of samples. 2)

parameters it checks each actual data value with the data value calculated from
the parameters received. If there is deviation beyond some predefined error
tolerance then only it sends the original data value to the sink node.

stripping (RPS) within a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation and evolution
which works in combination with non-radiative hydrodynamical simulations of
galaxy clusters. The new feature in our method is the use of the gas particles
to obtain the kinematical and thermodynamical properties of the intragroup and
intracluster medium (ICM). This allows a self-consistent estimation of the RPS
experienced by satellite galaxies. We find that the ram pressure (RP) in the
central regions of clusters increases approximately one order of magnitude
between z = 1 and 0, consistent with the increase in the density of the ICM.
The mean RP experienced by galaxies within the virial radius increases with
decreasing redshift. In clusters with virial masses M_vir ~10^15 h^-1 M_Sun,
over 50 per cent of satellite galaxies have experienced RP ~10^(-11) h^2 dyn
cm^-2 or higher for z <= 0.5. In smaller clusters (M_vir ~10^14 h^-1 M_Sun) the
mean RP are approximately one order of magnitude lower at all redshifts. RPS
has a strong effect on the cold gas content of galaxies for all cluster masses.
At z = 0, over 70 per cent of satellite galaxies within the virial radius are
completely depleted of cold gas. For the more massive clusters the fraction of
depleted galaxies is already established at z ~ 1, whereas for the smaller
clusters this fraction increases appreciably between z = 1 and 0. This
indicates that the rate at which the cold gas is stripped depends on the virial
mass of the host cluster. Compared to our new approach, the use of an analytic
profile to describe the ICM results in an overestimation of the RP larger than
50 per cent for z >= 0.5.

in ~190 massive galaxies with stellar masses greater than 10^10 Msun, obtained
from the Galex Arecibo SDSS Survey (GASS) described in Paper I (Catinella et
al. 2010) to explore the global scaling relations associated with the
bin-averaged ratio of the star formation rate over the HI mass, which we call
the HI-based star formation efficiency (SFE). Unlike the mean specific star
formation rate, which decreases with stellar mass and stellar mass surface
density, the star formation efficiency remains relatively constant across the
sample with a value close to SFE = 10^-9.5 yr^-1 (or an equivalent gas
consumption timescale of ~3 Gyr). Specifically, we find little variation in SFE
with stellar mass, stellar mass surface density, NUV-r color and concentration.
We interpret these results as an indication that external processes or feedback
mechanisms that control the gas supply are important for regulating star
formation in massive galaxies. An investigation into the detailed distribution
of SFEs reveals that approximately 5% of the sample shows high efficiencies
with SFE > 10^-9 yr^-1, and we suggest that this is very likely due to a
deficiency of cold gas rather than an excess star formation rate. Conversely,
we also find a similar fraction of galaxies that appear to be gas-rich for
their given specific star-formation rate, although these galaxies show both a
higher than average gas fraction and lower than average specific star formation
rate. Both of these populations are plausible candidates for ""transition""
galaxies, showing potential for a change (either decrease or increase) in their
specific star formation rate in the near future. We also find that 36+/-5% of
the total HI mass density and 47+/-5% of the total SFR density is found in

coherent dynamical processes in quantum dots. The potential due to a sharp,
flat interface lifts the degeneracy of the lowest energy valleys and yields a
set of valley eigenstates. Interface roughness is characterized by fluctuations
in the location of the interface and in the magnitude of the potential step.
Variations in the position of the interface, which are expected to occur on the
length scale of the lattice constant, reduce the magnitude of the valley-orbit
coupling. Variations in the size of the interface potential step alter the
magnitude of the valley-orbit coupling and induce transitions between different
valley eigenstates in dynamics involving two (or more) dots. Such transitions
can be studied experimentally by manipulating the bias between two dots and can
be detected by charge sensing. However, if the random variable characterizing
the position of the interface is correlated over distances of the order of a
quantum dot, which is unlikely but possible, the phase of the valley-orbit
coupling may be different in adjacent dots. In this case tunneling between like
and opposite valley eigenstates is in effect a random variable and cannot be
controlled. We suggest a resonant tunneling experiment that can identify the
matrix elements for tunneling between like and opposite valley eigenstates.

unbarred S0-Sb galaxies were analyzed to derive the intrinsic shape of their
bulges. We developed a new method to derive the intrinsic shape of bulges based
on the geometrical relationships between the apparent and intrinsic shapes of
bulges and disks. The equatorial ellipticity and intrinsic flattening of bulges
were obtained from the length of the apparent major and minor semi-axes of the
bulge, twist angle between the apparent major axis of the bulge and the galaxy
line of nodes, and galaxy inclination. We found that the intrinsic shape is
well constrained for a subsample of 115 bulges with favorable viewing angles. A
large fraction of them is characterized by an elliptical section (B/A<0.9).
This fraction is 33%, 55%, and 43% if using their maximum, mean, or median
equatorial ellipticity, respectively. Most are flattened along their polar axis
(C<(A+B)/2). The distribution of triaxiality is strongly bimodal. This
bimodality is driven by bulges with Sersic index n>2, or equivalently, by the
bulges of galaxies with a bulge-to-total ratio B/T>0.3. In particular, bulges
with n\leq2 and with B/T\leq0.3 show a larger fraction of oblate axisymmetric
(or nearly axisymmetric) bulges, a smaller fraction of triaxial bulges, and
fewer prolate axisymmetric (or nearly axisymmetric) bulges with respect to
bulges with n>2 and with B/T>0.3, respectively. According to predictions of the
numerical simulations of bulge formation, bulges with n\leq2, which show a high
fraction of oblate axisymmetric (or nearly axisymmetric) shapes and have
B/T\leq0.3, could be the result of dissipational minor mergers. Both major
dissipational and dissipationless mergers seem to be required to explain the
variety of shapes found for bulges with n>2 and B/T>0.3.

physical properties of the Galactic disc gas in front of the LMC on sub-pc
scales. We analyse absorption lines of a number of ions within the UV spectral
range. Most importantly, interstellar molecular hydrogen, neutral oxygen, and
fine-structure levels of neutral carbon have been used in order to study
changes in the density and the physical properties of the Galactic disc gas
over small angular scales. While most species do not show any significant
variation in their column densities, we find an enhancement of almost 2 dex for
H_2 from Sk-67{\deg}111 to Sk-67{\deg}101, accompanied by only a small
variation in the OI column density. Based on the formation-dissociation
equilibrium, we trace these variations to the actual density variations in the
molecular gas. On the smallest spatial scale of < 0.08 pc, between
Sk-67{\deg}107 and LH54-425, we find a gas density variation of a factor of
1.8. The line of sight towards LH54-425 does not follow the relatively smooth
change seen from Sk-67{\deg}101 to Sk-67{\deg}111, suggesting that
sub-structure might exist on a smaller spatial scale than the linear extent of
our sight-lines. Our observations suggest that the detected H_2 in these six
lines of sight is not necessarily physically connected, but that we are
sampling molecular cloudlets with pathlengths < 0.1-1.8 pc and possibly
different densities.

and 1/3 have prominent jets. If we follow the original definition of the FR
types (a division based solely on r), FR I and FR II RGs overlap in their host
galaxy properties. However, the rare, LD sources with r>0.8 AND OIII5007 line
luminosity >10^6 Lsun are markedly different on average from the rest of the
RGs, in the sense that they are hosted in lower mass galaxies, live in
relatively sparse environments, and have higher accretion rates onto the
central SMBH. Thus these objects and the rest of RGs form a well-defined
dichotomy. Motivated by the stark differences in the nuclear emission line
properties of the RG subsamples, we suggest that the accretion rate onto the
SMBH may play the primary role in creating the different morphologies. At
relatively high accretion rates, the accretion system may produce powerful jets
that create the ""classical double"" morphology (roughly corresponding to the LD
sources with r>0.8 and emission lines); at lower accretion rates the jets from
a radiatively inefficient accretion flow generate radio lobes without apparent
""hot spots"" at the edge (corresponding to the majority of LD sources). At
slightly lower accretion rates AND in galaxies with dense galactic structure,
sources with prominent jets result. It is possible that while the high
accretion rate systems could affect sub-Mpc scale environments, the jets from
lower accretion rate systems may efficiently suppress activity within the host
galaxies.

quiescent galaxies selected based on their extinction-corrected U-V colors out
to z=2.2, with accurate photometric redshifts, sigma_z/(1+z)~2%, and rest-frame
colors, sigma_U-V~0.06 mag. We measure an increase in the intrinsic scatter of
the rest-frame U-V colors of quiescent galaxies with redshift. This scatter in
color arises from the spread in ages of the quiescent galaxies, where we see
both relatively quiescent red, old galaxies and quiescent blue, younger
galaxies towards higher redshift. The trends between color and age are
consistent with the observed composite rest-frame spectral energy distributions
(SEDs) of these galaxies. The composite SEDs of the reddest and bluest
quiescent galaxies are fundamentally different, with remarkably well-defined
4000A- and Balmer-breaks, respectively. Some of the quiescent galaxies may be
up to 4 times older than the average age- and up to the age of the universe, if
the assumption of solar metallicity is correct. By matching the scatter
predicted by models that include growth of the red sequence by the
transformation of blue galaxies to the observed intrinsic scatter, the data
indicate that most early-type galaxies formed their stars at high redshift with
a burst of star formation prior to migrating to the red sequence. The observed
U-V color evolution with redshift is weaker than passive evolution predicts;
possible mechanisms to slow the color evolution include increasing amounts of
dust in quiescent galaxies towards higher redshift, red mergers at z<1, and a
frosting of relatively young stars from star formation at later times.

classical Roche approximations, we self-consistently account for the tidal and
rotational deformations of both components, and relax the assumptions of
ellipsoidal configurations and Keplerian rotation. We find numerical solutions
for mass ratios q between 1e-3 and 1, starting at a small angular velocity for
which tidal and rotational deformations are small, and following a sequence of
increasing angular velocities. Each series terminates at an appropriate ``Roche
limit'', above which no equilibrium solution can be found. Even though the
Roche limit is crossed before the ``Roche lobe'' is filled, any further
increase in the angular velocity will result in mass-loss. For close,
comparable-mass binaries, we find that local deviations from ellipsoidal forms
may be as large as 10-20%, and departures from Keplerian rotation are
significant. We compute the light curves that arise from our equilibrium
configurations, assuming their distance is >>1 AU (e.g. in the Kuiper Belt). We
consider both backscatter (proportional to the projected area) and diffuse
(Lambert) reflections. Backscatter reflection always yields two minima of equal
depths. Diffuse reflection, which is sensitive to the surface curvature,
generally gives rise to unequal minima. We find detectable intensity
differences of up to 10% between our light curves and those arising from the
Roche approximations. Finally, we apply our models to Kuiper Belt binary 2001

shed light on the physical conditions in a plausibly similar low mass galaxy by
presenting the analysis of the rest-frame optical and UV spectra of
Q2343-BX418, an L* galaxy at z=2.3 with a very low mass-to-light ratio and

rest-frame optical emission lines. We also determine the metallicity via the
direct, electron temperature method, using the ratio O III] 1661, 1666/[O III]
5007 to determine the electron temperature and finding 12+ log(O/H)=7.8 +/-

emission from Lya (with rest-frame equivalent width 54 A), He II 1640 (both
stellar and nebular), C III] 1907, 1909 and O III] 1661, 1666. The C IV/C III]

heavy sterile neutrinos can be produced in accelerators from decays of the

presence of an extended Higgs sector and the coupling of the singlet fermions
to the latter. In the same scenario, a relic matter abundance arises from the
decay of the singlet Higgs into weakly coupled keV sterile neutrinos. The

measure the 3D power spectrum of ionized regions during reionization. We
examine whether intermediate scale instruments with complete Fourier (uv)
coverage are capable of placing new constraints on reionization. We find that
even without using a full power spectrum analysis, the global redshift of
reionization, z_reion, can in principle be measured from the variance in the
21-cm signal among multiple beams as a function of frequency at a roughly 1
degree angular scale. At this scale, the beam-to-beam variance in the
differential brightness temperature peaks when the average neutral fraction was
around 50%, providing a convenient flag of z_reion. We choose a low angular
resolution of order 1 degree to exploit the physical size of the ionized
regions and maximize the signal-to-noise ratio. Thermal noise, foregrounds, and
instrumental effects should also be manageable at this angular scale, as long
as the uv coverage is complete within the compact core required for
low-resolution imaging. For example, we find that z_reion can potentially be

directly from time-series data the decision-making strategies used by
individuals and groups. This technique uses Monte Carlo simulation to test
alternative causal models of conflict dynamics. We find individuals base their
decision to fight on memory of social factors, not on short timescale
ecological resource competition. Furthermore, the social assessments on which
these decisions are based are triadic (self in relation to another pair of
individuals), not pairwise. We show that this triadic decision making causes
long conflict cascades and that there is a high population cost of the large
fights associated with these cascades. These results suggest that individual
agency has been over-emphasized in the social evolution of complex aggregates,
and that pair-wise formalisms are inadequate. An appreciation of the empirical
foundations of the collective dynamics of conflict is a crucial step towards
its effective management.

strong AGNs, low metallicity galaxies or ULIRGs), we find significant
variations in PAH, continuum and emission line properties and systematic trends
between these MIR properties and optically derived physical properties such as
age, metallicity and radiation field hardness. We revisit the diagnostic

decompositions are used, while also potentially revealing obscured AGNs. The
luminosity of individual PAH components, of the continuum, and with poorer

development of Bayesian statistics since its XX-th century revival, rooted on
the work of de Finetti, Savage and others. The basic metaphor presented in this

eigen-solution, and the verification of its objective epistemic status. The
FBST - Full Bayesian Significance Test - is the cornerstone of a set of
statistical tolls conceived to assess the epistemic value of such

also detected an additional companion with a period of 3.7 days (CoRoT-7c) and
a mass of 8.4 M_Earth. The mass of CoRoT-7b is a crucial parameter for planet
structure models, but is difficult to determine because CoRoT-7 is a modestly
active star and there is at least one additional companion. A Fourier analysis
was performed on spectral data for CoRoT-7 taken with the HARPS spectrograph.
These data include RV measurements, spectral line bisectors, the full width at
half maximum of the cross-correlation function, and Ca II emission. The latter
3 quantities vary due to stellar activity and were used to assess the nature of
the observed RV variations. An analysis of a sub-set of the RV measurements
where multiple observations were made per night was also used to estimate the
RV amplitude from CoRoT-7b that was less sensitive to activity variations. Our
analysis indicates that the 0.85-d and 3.7-d RV signals of CoRoT-7b and
CoRoT-7c are present in the spectral data with a high degree of statistical
significance. We also find evidence for another significant RV signal at 9
days. An analysis of the activity indicator data reveals that this 9-d signal
most likely does not arise from activity, but possibly from an additional
companion. If due to a planetary companion the mass is m = 19.5 M_Earth,
assuming co-planarity with CoRoT-7b. A dynamical study of the three planet
system shows that it is stable over several hundred millions of years. Our
analysis yields a RV amplitude of 5.04 +/- 1.09 m/s for CoRoT-7b which
corresponds to a planet mass of m = 6.9 +/- 1.4 M_Earth. This increased mass
would make the planet CoRoT-7b more Earth-like in its internal structure.

the thermodynamic maps reveals the dramatic and complex temperature, pressure,
entropy and metallicity structure of the system. Excluding the 'X-ray arms',
the diffuse cluster gas at a given radius is strikingly isothermal. This
suggests either that the ambient cluster gas, beyond the arms, remains
relatively undisturbed by AGN uplift, or that conduction in the intracluster
medium (ICM) is efficient along azimuthal directions. We confirm the presence
of a thick ($\sim$40 arcsec or $\sim$3 kpc) ring of high pressure gas at a
radius of $\sim$180 arcsec ($\sim$14 kpc) from the central AGN. We verify that
this feature is associated with a classical shock front, with an average Mach
number M = 1.25. Another, younger shock-like feature is observed at a radius of
$\sim$40 arcsec ($\sim$3 kpc) surrounding the central AGN, with an estimated
Mach number M > 1.2. As shown previously, if repeated shocks occur every
$\sim$10 Myrs, as suggested by these observations, then AGN driven weak shocks
could produce enough energy to offset radiative cooling of the ICM. A high
significance enhancement of Fe abundance is observed at radii 350 - 400 arcsec
(27 - 31 kpc). This ridge is likely formed in the wake of the rising bubbles
filled with radio-emitting plasma that drag cool, metal-rich gas out of the

Fe has been lifted and deposited at a radius of 350-400 arcsec; approximately
the same mass of Fe is measured in the X-ray bright arms, suggesting that a

atmospheric and formation models. With the discovery of many hot Jupiter
planets orbiting nearby stars, this motivates the development of robust methods
of characterisation from follow up observations. In this paper we discuss two
methods for determining the planetary albedo in transiting systems. First, the
most widely used method for measuring the light scattered by hot Jupiters
(Collier Cameron et al.) is investigated for application for typical echelle
spectra of a transiting planet system, showing that detection requires high
signal-to-noise ratio data of bright planets. Secondly a new Fourier analysis
method is also presented, which is model-independent and utilises the benefits
of the reduced number of unknown parameters in transiting systems. This
approach involves solving for the planet and stellar spectra in Fourier space
by least-squares. The sensitivities of the methods are determined via Monte
Carlo simulations for a range of planet-to-star fluxes. We find the Fourier
analysis method to be better suited to the ideal case of typical observations
of a well constrained transiting system than the Collier Cameron et al. method.
We apply the Fourier analysis method for extracting the light scattered by
transiting hot Jupiters from high resolution spectra to echelle spectra of HD
209458 and HD 189733. Unfortunately we are unable to improve on the previous
upper limit of the planet-to-star flux for HD 209458b set by space-based
observations. A 1{\sigma}upper limit on the planet-to-star flux of HD 189733b
is measured in the wavelength range of 558.83-599.56 nm yielding {\epsilon} <
4.5 \times 10-4. Improvement in the measurement of the upper limit of the
planet-to-star flux of this system, with ground-based capabilities, requires
data with a higher signal-to-noise ratio, and increased stability of the
telescope.

composite galaxies (composite AGNs) into ROSAT-selected Seyfert 1.8/1.9
galaxies basing upon the RASS/SDSS-DR5 catalog given by Anderson et al.. The
SDSS spectra of in total 92 objects are analyzed by the same method used in our
previous studies, after requiring the signal-to-noise ratio in the SDSS r' band
is larger than 20. Combing the ROSAT-selected Seyfert galaxies with the
composite AGNs reinforces the tight correlation between the line ratio
[OI]/H\alpha vs. D_n(4000), and establishes a new tight correlation between
[SII]/H\alpha vs. D_n(4000). Both correlations suggest the two line ratios are
plausible age indicators of the circumnuclear stellar population for typical
type I AGNs in which the stellar populations are difficult to be derived from
their optical spectra. The ROSAT-selected Seyfert galaxies show that the two
correlations depend on the soft X-ray spectral slope \alpha_X that is roughly
estimated from the hardness ratios by requiring the X-ray count rates within
0.1-2.4 keV are larger than 0.02 counts s^-1. However, we fail to establish a
relationship between \alpha_X and D_n(4000), which is likely caused by the
relatively large uncertainties of both parameters (especially for \alpha_X
because of the AGN intrinsic obscuration). The previously established
L/L_Edd-D_n(4000) evolutionary sequence is reinforced again by the extension to
the ROSAT-selected Seyfert galaxies. These X-ray-selected Seyfert galaxies are,
however, biased against the two ends of the sequence, which implies that the
X-ray Seyfert galaxies present a population at middle evolutionary stage.

derivatization with polyethylene glycol (PEG) in a range of immortalized cell

discussion about the effect of nanoparticle size, charge and surface groups is

non-specific uptake while PEG-free carboxyl and amine functional groups promote
QD internalization. These uptake variations displayed a remarkable consistency
across different cell types. The reported results are important for experiments
concerned with cellular uptake of surface-functionalized nanomaterials, both
when non-specific internalization is undesirable and also when it is intended
for material to be internalized as efficiently as possible.

polar oppositions of organism and environment. We argue that a triadic
conceptual structure offers an alternative perspective under which the
information generating role of evolution as a physical process can be analyzed,
and propose a new diagrammatic approach. Peirce's natural philosophy was deeply
influenced by his reception of both Darwin's theory and thermodynamics. Thus,
we elaborate on a new synthesis which puts together his theory of signs and
modern Maximum Entropy approaches to evolution. Following recent contributions
to the naturalization of Peircean semiosis, we show that triadic structures
involve the conjunction of three different kinds of causality, efficient,
formal and final. We apply this on Ulanowicz's analysis of autocatalytic cycles
as primordial patterns of life. This paves the way for a semiotic view of
thermodynamics which is built on the idea that Peircean interpretants are
systems of physical inference devices evolving under natural selection. In this
view, the principles of Maximum Entropy, Maximum Power, and Maximum Entropy
Production work together to drive the emergence of information carrying
structures, which at the same time maximize information capacity as well as the
gradients of energy flows, such that ultimately, contrary to Schroedinger's
seminal contribution, the evolutionary process is seen to be a physical
expression of the Second Law.

perturbation at the intermediate scale. The contribution for each diagram can
be compared to the correspondent in the four-dimensional theory. It is found
that for a part of the contributions the coefficient for the logarithmic
scaling has the same value as the four-dimensional results. A viewpoint to
treat corrections associated with higher-dimensional operators is also
discussed.

We estimate the size of the effect in helium, lithium, and beryllium nuclei. It

for the correction to the mean-square charge radius due to the spin-orbit term

diffraction has important effects on the spectra coming from very high

amplitude of the polarization signals and changes the asymmetry of the Stokes
profiles. The two Fe I lines at 525 nm meet the scientific requirements of
IMaX, but Fe I 525.02 nm is to be preferred because it leads to smaller

that in deeply jammed soft materials spatial correlations of the dynamics are
quite generally ultra-long ranged, extending up to the system size, orders of

contrasted with the case of molecular, colloidal and granular ``supercooled''

systems with enthalpic elasticity exhibit ultra-long range correlations due to
the effective transmission of strains throughout the contact network.

complexes at submicronic scales. This suggests that the colloidal stability of
the complexes can be explained by the interlocking of the fractal aggregates in
a network at high concentration: dilution does not break the local aggregate
structure but it does destroy the network. We show, secondly, that the addition
of salt does not change the almost frozen inner structure of the cores of the
primary complexes, although it does encourage growth of the complexes; these
coalesce into larger complexes as salt has partially screened the electrostatic
repulsions between two primary complexes. These larger primary complexes remain
aggregated with a fractal dimension of 2.1. Thirdly, we show that the addition
of PSS chains up to [-]/[+]intro ~ 20, after the formation of the primary
complex with a [-]/[+]intro close to 1, only slightly changes the inner
structure of the primary complexes. Moreover, in contrast to the synthesis
achieved in the one-step mixing procedure where the proteins are unfolded for a
range of [-]/[+]intro, the native conformation of the proteins is preserved
inside the frozen core.

elaboration of a mock catalogue that allows us to have a reliability criterion
for the derived parameters. We studied LIRGs by means of an SED-fitting code
CIGALE. At first, this code creates synthetic spectra from the Maraston stellar
population models. The stellar population spectra are attenuated by using a
synthetic Calzetti-based attenuation law before adding the dust emission as
given by the infrared SED library. The originality of CIGALE is that it allows
us to perform consistent fits of the dust-affected ultaviolet-to-infrared
wavelength range. This technique appears to be a very powerful tool in the case
where we can have access to a dataset that is well-sampled over a wide range of
wavelengths. We are able to derive a star formation history and to estimate the
fraction of infrared luminosity reprocessed by an active galactic nucleus. We
study the dust temperatures of our galaxies detected at 70 \mu\m and find them

analysis of the model, obtaining analytical results and introducing some
approximations which allow us to reconstruct the results of our previous work.
In particular, we show that the population dynamics equations of a very general
class of trophic-level structured food-web have an unique interior equilibrium
point which is globally stable. We show analytically that communities found as
end states of the assembly process are pyramidal and we find that the
equilibrium abundance of any species at any trophic level is approximately
inversely proportional to the number of species in that level. We also find
that the per capita growth rate of a top predator invading a resident community
is key to understand the appearance of complex end states reported in our
previous work. The sign of these rates allows us to separate regions in the
space of parameters where the end state is either a single community or a
complex set containing more than one community. We have also built up
analytical approximations to the time evolution of species abundances that
allow us to determine, with high accuracy, the sequence of extinctions that an
invasion may cause. Finally we apply this analysis to obtain the communities in
the end states. To test the accuracy of the transition probability matrix
generated by this analytical procedure for the end states, we have compared
averages over those sets with those obtained from the graph derived by
numerical integration of the Lotka-Volterra equations. The agreement is
excellent.

developed a full analytical treatment of the model of species assembly
introduced in Capitan et al. (2009). This model is based on the construction of
an assembly graph containing all viable configurations of the community, and
the definition of a Markov chain whose transitions are the transformations of
communities by new species invasions. In the present paper we provide an
exhaustive numerical analysis of the model, describing the average time to the
recurrent state, the statistics of avalanches, and the dependence of the
results on the amount of available resource. Our results are based on the fact
that the Markov chain provides an asymptotic probability distribution for the
recurrent states, which can be used to obtain averages of observables as well
as the time variation of these magnitudes during succession, in an exact
manner. Since the absorption times into the recurrent set are found to be
comparable to the size of the system, the end state is quickly reached (in
units of the invasion time). Thus, the final ecosystem can be regarded as a
fluctuating complex system where species are continually replaced by newcomers
without ever leaving the set of recurrent patterns. The assembly graph is
dominated by pathways in which most invasions are accepted, triggering small
extinction avalanches. Through the assembly process, communities become less
resilient (e.g., have a higher return time to equilibrium) but become more
robust in terms of resistance against new invasions.

We show that the dynamical systems can be uniquely singled out from among other
relativistic rotators by the unphysical requirement that the Hessian referring
to the physical degrees of freedom should be singular. Closely related is the
fact that the equations of free motion are not independent, making the
evolution indeterminate. We show that the Hessian singularity cannot be removed
by the minimal interaction with the electromagnetic field. By making use of a
nontrivial Hessian null space, we show that a single constraint appears in the
external field for consistency of the equations of motion with the Hessian
singularity. The constraint imposes unphysical limitation on the initial
conditions and admissible motions. We discuss the mechanism of appearance of
unique solutions in external fields on an example of motion in the uniform
magnetic field. We give a simple model to illustrate that similarly constrained
evolution cannot be determinate in arbitrary fields.

moduli of $V$ and the complex structure moduli of $X$. Solutions of $DW=0$ (or
even of $DW=W=0$) can arise either by nontrivial cancellations between the
individual terms in the summation over all contributing curves or because each
of these terms is zero already individually. Concerning the latter case
conditions on the moduli making a single Pfaffian vanish (for special moduli
values) have been investigated. However, even if corresponding moduli -
fulfilling these constraints - for the individual contribution of one curve are
known it is not at all clear whether {\em one} choice of moduli exists which
fulfills the corresponding constraints {\em for all contributing curves

the 'individual zeroes' had already a conceptual origin which allows them to
fit together consistently. We show that this happens for a class of cases. In

processor make it possible to be executed on multiple processors without any
software modifications; (2) secure processor partitioning with hardware
support, by which Operating Systems (OSs) required for base and open
applications are securely executed on separate processors; (3) asymmetric
virtualization, by which many OSs over the number of processors are securely
executed under secure processor partitioning; and (4) secure dynamic

field gives important information about the structure and dynamics of the Milky
Way, as well as constitutes a basic tool to determine cosmic rays trajectories.
It can also provide clear windows where primordial magnetic fields could be
detected. We want to obtain the regular (large scale) pattern of the magnetic
field distribution of the Milky Way that better fits the polarized synchrotron
emission as seen by the 5-year WMAP data at 22 GHz. We have done a systematic
study of a number of Galactic magnetic field models: axisymmetric, bisymmetric,
logarithmic spiral arms, concentric circular rings with reversals and
bi-toroidal. We have explored the parameter space defining each of these models
using a grid-based approach. In total, more than one million models are
computed. The model selection is done using a Bayesian approach. For each
model, the posterior distributions are obtained and marginalised over the
unwanted parameters to obtain the marginal 1-D probability distribution
functions. In general, axisymmetric models provide a better description of the
halo component, although attending to their goodness-of-fit, the rest of the
models cannot be rejected. In the case of disk component, the analysis is not
very sensitive for obtaining the disk large scale structure, because of the
effective available area (less than 8% of the whole map and less than 40% of
the disk). Nevertheless, within a given family of models, the best-fit
parameters are compatible with those found in the literature. The family of
models that better describes the polarized synchrotron halo emission is the
axisymmetric one, with magnetic spiral arms with a pitch angle of ~24 degrees,
and a strong vertical field of 1 microG at z ~ 1 kpc. When a radial variation
is fitted, models require fast variations.

Spatio-temporal mapping of radiocarbon date intensity is confounded by uneven
post-depositional thinning. We assume that the confounding processes act in
such a way that the absence of dates remains informative of zero rate for the
original deposition process. We model and fit the onset-field, that is, we
estimate for each location across the site the time at which deposition of
datable specimens began. The temporal process generating our spatial

Teff, log g, v sin i, and luminosity needed for computing asteroseismic models

early-type Kepler asteroseismic targets, 13 other stars in the Kepler field,

performing a cross-correlation with template spectra to help us identify
non-single stars. Spectral synthesis was performed to derive the stellar
parameters of our target stars, and the state-of-the-art LTE atmospheric models
were computed. For all the stars of our sample, we derived the radial velocity,
Teff, log g, v sin i, and luminosities. For 12 stars, we performed a detailed
abundance analysis of 20 species, for 16, we could derive only the [Fe/H]
ratio. A spectral classification was also performed for 17 stars in the sample.
We identify two double-lined spectroscopic binaries, HIP96299 and HIP98551, the
former of which is an already known eclipsing binary, and two single-lined
spectroscopic binaries, HIP 97254 and HIP 97724. We also report two suspected

moduli of the vorticity and current density, the energy dissipation rates, and
velocity and magnetic-field increments, energy and other spectra, velocity and
magnetic-field structure functions, which we use to characterise intermittency,
isosurfaces of quantities such as the moduli of the vorticity and current, and
joint PDFs such as those of fluid and magnetic dissipation rates. Our
systematic study uncovers interesting results that have not been noted
hitherto. In particular, we find a crossover from larger intermittency in the
magnetic field than in the velocity field, at large ${\rm Pr_M}$, to smaller
intermittency in the magnetic field than in the velocity field, at low ${\rm

Dark Matter (DM) is studied within the context of a self-consistent truncated

Our halo model takes into account the modifications of the phase-space
structure of the halo due to the gravitational influence of the observed
visible matter in a self-consistent manner. The parameters of the halo model
are determined by a fit to a recently determined circular rotation curve of the
Galaxy that extends up to $\sim$ 60 kpc. Unlike in the Standard Halo Model
(SHM) customarily used in the analysis of the results of WIMP direct detection
experiments, the velocity distribution of the WIMPs in our model is
non-Maxwellian with a cut-off at a maximum velocity that is self-consistently
determined by the model itself. For our halo model that provides the best fit
to the rotation curve data, the 90% C.L. upper limit on the WIMP-nucleon
spin-independent cross section from the recent results of the CDMS-II
experiment, for example, is $\sim 5.3\times10^{-8}\pb$ at a WIMP mass of $\sim$
71 GeV. We also find, using the original 2-bin annual modulation amplitude data
of the DAMA experiment, that there exists a range of small WIMP masses,
typically $\sim$ 2 -- 16 GeV, within which DAMA collaboration's claimed annual
modulation signal purportedly due to WIMPs is compatible with the null results
of other experiments. These results strengthen the possibility of low-mass
($\lsim 10\gev$) WIMPs as a candidate for dark matter as indicated by several

analysis using DAMA bins over smaller intervals should be able to better
constrain the ""DAMA regions"" in the WIMP parameter space within the context of

large scale atomistic models of nanostructured titania surfaces (consisting of
spherical nanocaps on top of a (110) rutile surface) and we study the adhesion
of an oligothiophene as a function of their local curvature and roughness. In
the limit of a perfect planar surface, the maximum adhesion energy is
calculated to be as large as 0:6 eV per monomer, and it corresponds to the
oligothiophene oriented along the [$\bar{1}10$] direction of the surface.
Deformations of the polymer are observed due the incommensurability between the
titania and the polymer lattice parameters. When the surface is nanostructured,
the adhesion of the polymer is affected by the local morphology and a
nonmonotonic dependence on the surface curvature is observed. The atomistic
results are explained by a simple um model that includes the strain energy of
the polymer and its electrostatic interaction with the local surface charge.

found that these theories can evade solar system tests of post-Newtonian

these theories contain both massless and massive degrees of freedom, and that
in general there are two different types of massive mode, each with a different
mass parameter. If both of these masses are sufficiently large then the
predictions of the most general class of theories we consider are
indistinguishable from those of general relativity, up to post-Newtonian order
in a weak field, low velocity expansion. In the limit that the massive modes
become massless, we find that these general theories do not exhibit a van
Dam-Veltman-Zakharov-like discontinuity in their gamma parameter, although
there are discontinuities in other post-Newtonian parameters as the massless
limit is approached. This smooth behaviour in gamma is due to the
discontinuities from each of the two different massive modes cancelling each
other out. Such cancellations cannot occur in special cases with only one
massive mode, such as the Isham-Salam-Strathdee theory.

independent, identically distributed variables, recently introduced to describe
finite size effects, is presented here in terms of a partial differential
equation (PDE). This yields a flow in function space and gives rise to the
known family of Fisher-Tippett limit distributions as fixed points, together
with the universal eigenfunctions around them. The PDE turns out to handle
correctly distributions even having discontinuities. Remarkably, the PDE admits
exact solutions in terms of eigenfunctions even farther from the fixed points.
In particular, such are unstable manifolds emanating from and returning to the
Gumbel fixed point, when the running eigenvalue and the perturbation strength
parameter obey a pair of coupled ordinary differential equations. Exact
renormalization trajectories corresponding to linear combinations of
eigenfunctions can also be given, and it is shown that such are all solutions
of the PDE. Explicit formulas for some invariant manifolds in the Fr\'echet and
Weibull cases are also presented. Finally, the similarity between
renormalization flows for extreme value statistics and the central limit
problem is stressed, whence follows the equivalence of the formulas for Weibull
distributions and the moment generating function of symmetric L\'evy stable
distributions.

For subspaces $M^n(t)$ and

system of two independent equations. A notion of equivalence of linear
differential equations of different orders is introduced. Necessary and
sufficient conditions of this equivalence are given. These results are applied
to the Flocke-Lyapunov theory for linear equations with periodic coefficients
with a period T. In the case when monodromy matrix of the equation has negative
eigenvalues, thus reduction in $R^m$ to an equation with constant coeficcients
is possible only with doubling of reduction matrix period, we prove the
possibility of splitting off in $R^m$ of equations with negative eigenvalues of
monodromy matrix with the help of a real matrix without period doubling. For
the fundamental matrix of solutions of an equation with periodic coefficients
$X(t), X(t)=E$, we find representation $X(t)=\Phi(t)e^{Ht}\Phi^{+}(0)$ with
real rectangular matrices $H$ and $\Phi(t), \Phi(t)=\Phi(t+T)$. We bring two
applications of these results: 1) reduction of nonlinear differential equation
in $R^n$ with distinguished linear part which is periodic with period T to the
equation in $R^m, m>n$, with a constiant matrix of coefficients of the linear
part; 2) for introdusing of amplitude-phase coordinates in the neigbourhood of
periodic orbit of autonomous differential equation with separation of the
linear part with constant matrix of coefficients.

flavor violation (lepton flavor violation) at creation without requiring
neutrino propagation. The exact amount of flavor violation depends on the
neutrino flavor state to be detected. For realistic conditions, the violation
is tiny but much larger than other indirect lepton flavor violation processes
not involving neutrinos as final states. For neutrinos produced in a continuous

narrow and difficult to characterize aside from a few ground state properties.
The BOW phase of a frustrated Heisenberg spin chain is wide and tractable. It
has broken inversion symmetry C_i in a regular array and finite gap E_m to the
lowest triplet state. The spin-BOW is exact in finite systems at a special
point. Its elementary excitations are spin-1/2 solitons that connect BOWs with
opposite phase. The same patterns of spin densities and bond orders appear in
the BOW phase of Hubbard-type models. Infrared (IR) active lattice phonons or
molecular vibrations are derivatives of P, the polarization along the stack.
Molecular vibrations that are forbidden in regular arrays become IR active when
C_i symmetry is broken. 1:1 alkali-TCNQ salts contain half-filled regular TCNQ-
stacks at high temperature, down to 100 K in the Rb-TCNQ(II) polymorph whose
magnetic susceptibility and polarized IR spectra indicate a BOW phase. More
complete modeling will require explicit electronic coupling to phonons and
molecular vibrations.

basis of comparing the wave simulation results found from both models against
the buoy data obtained in three oceanic regions: eastern and western parts of
the North Atlantic, and the Barenz Sea. First of all, incorporation of the new
source function into the numerical codes of WAVEWATCH was done, and this
modified version of WAVEWATCH was fitted and tested by standard tests. On the
basis of these results some physical conclusions were drawn. Then,
sophisticated fitting of the modified model was carried out, using the
observation data of 19 buoys obtained in two regions of the North Atlantic for
a period of 30 days at 1-hour time intervals. After this, the standard
validation of both models was continued on the basis of the 8-month historical
data, corresponding to 12 buoys located in the western part of the North
Atlantic. Finally, comparative validation of the models was done against the
wave observations obtained at one buoy in the Barenz Sea for a period of 3
years at 6-hour time intervals. Estimations of simulation accuracy were carried
out for the three parameters of wind waves: significant wave height, Hs , peak
wave period, Tp , and mean wave period, Tm. Comparative analysis of these
estimations was carried out for the original and modified model WAVEWATCH. The
advantage of the modified model was revealed, with an increase of simulation
accuracy for Hs by 20 to 50% for more than 70% of the buoys considered.
Additionally, it was found that the speed of calculation was increased by 15%.

discovered by the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect (SZE). We identify 21 secure
spectroscopic members within 0.9 Mpc of the SPT cluster position, 18 of which
are quiescent, early-type galaxies. From these quiescent galaxies we obtain a

the most dynamically massive cluster yet discovered at z > 1. Assuming that

the atmosphere, and (c) a dissipation term quadratic in the wave spectrum.
Particular attention is given to a theoretical substantiation of the least

of the third generation WAM and WAVEWATCH. At the initial stage of assessing
the merits of the proposed model, the results of its testing by the system of

GALFORM semi-analytic galaxies which allow us to assess the degree of accuracy
of our estimates of Xi(sigma) and to identify and correct for systematic

limited subsamples of galaxies selected using their photometric redshifts and
rest-frame r-band absolute magnitudes. We find that the real-space correlation
length r_0 of bright galaxies, M_r<-21 (rest-frame) can be accurately recovered
out to z~1.5, particularly for ECDF-S given its near-infrared photometric
coverage. There is mild evidence for a luminosity dependent clustering in both
fields at the low redshift samples (up to <z>=0.57), where the correlation
length is higher for brighter galaxies by up to 1Mpc/h between median
rest-frame r-band absolute magnitudes of -18 to -21.5. As a result of the
photometric redshift measurement, each galaxy is assigned a best-fit template;
we restrict to E and E+20%Sbc types to construct subsamples of early type
galaxies (ETGs). Our ETG samples show a strong increase in r_0 as the redshift
increases, making it unlikely (95% level) that ETGs at median redshift

count is the number of intersections of the nodal lines with the boundary. We
study the integer sequence defined by these numbers, sorted according to the
energies of the eigenfunctions. Based on a variant of Berry's random wave
model, we derive a semi-classical trace formula for the sequence of boundary
domain counts. The formula consists of a Weyl-like smooth part, and an
oscillating part which depends on classical periodic orbits and their geometry.
The predictions of this trace formula are supported by numerical data computed
for the Africa billiard.

of clinical care for the elderly, due to the large increase in aging
population. Monitoring a patient in his home environment is necessary to ensure
continuity of care in home settings, but, to be useful, this activity must not
be too invasive for patients and a burden for caregivers. We prototyped a
system called SINDI (Secure and INDependent lIving), focused on i) collecting a
limited amount of data about the person and the environment through Wireless
Sensor Networks (WSN), and ii) inferring from these data enough information to
support caregivers in understanding patients' well being and in predicting
possible evolutions of their health. Our hierarchical logic-based model of
health combines data from different sources, sensor data, tests results,
common-sense knowledge and patient's clinical profile at the lower level, and
correlation rules between health conditions across upper levels. The logical
formalization and the reasoning process are based on Answer Set Programming.
The expressive power of this logic programming paradigm makes it possible to
reason about health evolution even when the available information is incomplete
and potentially incoherent, while declarativity simplifies rules specification
by caregivers and allows automatic encoding of knowledge. This paper describes
how these issues have been targeted in the application scenario of the SINDI
system.

caused due to the tangential passage of an astral body that grazed the Earths'
atmosphere, underwent a partial explosion and later entered a heliocentric
orbit. It has also been argued that astral bodies might deposit microbes and
viruses on Earth (contributing to evolution and diseases) and may become
contaminated with Earthly microbes. The identity of the Tunguska Space Body
(TSB) is unknown though several likely candidates have been identified
including NEA 2005NB56, a known Near Earth Asteroid (NEA). NEA 2005NB56 made a
close approach to Earth when it was discovered in 2005 and will again cross
Earth orbit in 2045. This gives us a unique opportunity to send a Stardustlike
mission, the proposed Vernadskiy Mission, to analyze materials from NEA
2005NB56. We might be able to find some tell-tale components of Earth's
atmosphere and even Earth's microorganisms incorporated in NEA 2005NB56 thereby
proving beyond doubt the transfer of life from Earth to outer space.

These drawings are part of reports made during experimenting. Aspects of
drawings are chosen for investigation that are linked to basic physical notions
like plasticity and spatiality. Also the aspects are required to link to the
motor recognition experience during drawing, of the one who made the drawing.
In this way the aim is to clarify the individual notions of space and time that
are basic to performing the experiments. These are called the attitude with
which the experiment is performed. Some aspects of these drawings tend to be
correlated in several trends. Polanyi's theory of consciousness is generalised
to explain why this correlation of aspects occurs. The correlation trends and
attitudes can be related to each other. The results are presented in a
schematic way to facilitate interpretation of the concepts introduced and of
the correlation results.

  with a repulsive interaction and derivation of a nonlinear sigma model",,,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A coherent state path integral is considered for bosons with an ensemble
average of a random potential and with an additional, repulsive interaction in
the context of BEC under inclusion of specially prepared disorder. The
essential normalization of the coherent state path integral, as a generating
function of observables, is obtained from the non-equilibrium time contour for
'forward' and 'backward' propagation so that a time contour metric has to be
taken into account in the ensemble average with the random potential.
Therefore, the respective symmetries for the derivation of a nonlinear sigma
model follow from the involved time contour metric which leads to a coset
decomposition Sp(4)/U(2) x U(2) of the symplectic group Sp(4) with the subgroup
U(2) for the unitary invariance of the density-related vacuum or ground state;
the corresponding spontaneous symmetry breaking gives rise to anomalous- or
'Nambu'-doubled field degrees of freedom within self-energy matrices which are
finally regarded by remaining coset matrices. The notion of a 'return
probability', according to the original 'Anderson-localization', is thus
naturally contained within coherent state path integrals of a non-equilibrium
contour time for equivalent 'forward' and 'backward' propagation.

threads with opposite polarities - may be a manifestation of a highly
non-potential magnetic configuration in active regions. To understand its
formation we have carried out a detailed analysis of the magnetic channel in AR
10930 using data taken by the Solar Optical Telescope/Hinode. As a result, we
found upflows (-0.5 to -1.0 km/s) and downflows (+1.5 to +2.0 km/s) inside and
at both tips of the thread respectively, and a pair of strong vertical currents
of opposite polarity along the channel. Moreover, our analysis of the nonlinear
force-free fields constructed from the photospheric magnetic field indicates
that the current density in the lower corona may have gradually increased as a
result of the continuous emergence of the highly sheared flux along the
channel. With these results, we suggest that the magnetic channel originates
from the emergence of the twisted flux tube that has formed below the surface
before the emergence.
