where a multi-material macroscopic preform is drawn into a sub-millimeter

be obtained from a single preform with fiber diameters ranging between 500um
-1000um. A typical measured capacitance of our fibers is 60-100 nF/m and it is
independent of the fiber diameter. For comparison, a coaxial cable of the
comparable dimensions would have only ~0.06nF/m capacitance. Analysis of the
fiber frequency response shows that in its simplest interrogation mode the
capacitor fiber has a transverse resistance of 5 kOhm/L, which is inversely
proportional to the fiber length L and is independent of the fiber diameter.
Softness of the fiber materials, absence of liquid electrolyte in the fiber

capacitance of our fibers make them interesting for various smart textile
applications ranging from distributed sensing to energy storage.

First, we consider the problem of approximating the Tutte polynomial of a
binary matroid with parameters q>= 2 and gamma. (Relative to the classical
(x,y) parameterisation, q=(x-1)(y-1) and gamma=y-1.) A graph is a special case
of a binary matroid, so earlier work by the authors shows inapproximability
(subject to certain complexity assumptions) for q>2, apart from the trivial
case gamma=0. The situation for q=2 is different. Previous results for graphs
imply inapproximability in the region -2<=gamma<0, apart from at two ""special
points"" where the polynomial can be computed exactly in polynomial time. For
binary matroids, we extend this result by showing (i) there is no FPRAS in the
region gamma<-2 unless NP=RP, and (ii) in the region gamma>0, the approximation
problem is hard for the complexity class #RHPi_1 under approximation-preserving
(AP) reducibility. The latter result indicates a gap in approximation
complexity at q=2: whereas an FPRAS is known in the graphical case, there can
be none in the binary matroid case, unless there is an FPRAS for all of
#RHPi_1. The result also implies that it is computationally difficult to
approximate the weight enumerator of a binary linear code, apart from at the
special weights at which the problem is exactly solvable in polynomial time. As
a consequence, we show that approximating the cycle index polynomial of a
permutation group is hard for #RHPi_1 under AP-reducibility, partially
resolving a question that we first posed in 1992.

with an estimate of these itemsets' frequencies with a bounded error. Our first
result is an upper bound on the sample size which guarantees that the top-K
frequent itemsets mined from a random sample of that size approximate the
actual top-K frequent itemsets, with probability larger than a specified value.
We show that the upper bound is asymptotically tight when w is constant. Our
main algorithmic contribution is a progressive sampling approach, combined with
suitable stopping conditions, which on appropriate inputs is able to extract
approximate top-K frequent itemsets from samples whose sizes are smaller than
the general upper bound. In order to test the stopping conditions, this
approach maintains the frequency of all itemsets encountered, which is
practical only for small w. However, we show how this problem can be mitigated
by using a variation of Bloom filters. A number of experiments conducted on
both synthetic and real bench- mark datasets show that using samples
substantially smaller than the original dataset (i.e., of size defined by the
upper bound or reached through the progressive sampling approach) enable to
approximate the actual top-K frequent itemsets with accuracy much higher than

infinity, except the case of $\beta=1$. This observation, which also can be
predicted from the mechanics analogue of fractional Maxwell's model, agrees

the three-point (and four-point) amplitudes of the symmetric tensors belonging
to the first Regge trajectory of the open bosonic string and relate them to
local couplings and currents. These include the cases first discussed, from a
field theory perspective, by Berends, Burgers and van Dam, and generalize their
results in a suggestive fashion along lines recently explored by Boulanger,
Metsaev and others. We also comment on the recovery of gauge symmetry in the
low-tension limit, on the current-exchange amplitudes that can be built from
these couplings and on the extension to mixed-symmetry states.

Transition disks between Class II (proto-planetary disks) and Class III (debris
disks) remain difficult to detect. We investigate the carbon chemistry of the
peculiar CQ Tau gas disk. It is likely a transition disk because it exhibits
weak CO emission with a relatively strong millimeter continuum, indicating that
the disk might be currently dissipating its gas content. We used APEX to
observe the two CI lines at 492GHz and 809 GHz in the disk orbiting CQ Tau. We
compare the observations to several chemical model predictions. We focus our
study on the influence of the stellar UV radiation shape and gas-to-dust ratio.
We did not detect the CI lines. However, our upper limits are deep enough to
exclude high-CI models. The only available models compatible with our limits
imply very low gas-to-dust ratio, of the order of a few, only. These
observations strengthen the hypothesis that CQ Tau is likely a transition disk
and suggest that gas disappears before dust.

magnetic field at the photosphere becoming more horizontal, and hence should
result in a downward (towards the solar interior) force change acting on the
photosphere and solar interior, as recently argued from an analysis of
magnetogram data by Wang and Liu (Astrophys. J. Lett. 716, L195, 2010). We
suggest the existence of an observational relationship between the force change
computed from changes in the vector magnetograms, the outward momentum carried
by the ejecta from the flare, and the properties of the helioseismic
disturbance driven by the downward force change. We use the impulse driven by
the Lorentz-force change in the outer solar atmosphere to derive an upper limit
to the mass of erupting plasma that can escape from the Sun. Finally, we
compare the expected Lorentz-force change at the photosphere with simple
estimates from flare-driven gasdynamic disturbances and from an estimate of the

mapping the communication problem to a control problem in which the control
signal is received through the same noisy channel as in the communication

a subclass of encoders available at the transmitter. The MMSE capacity is
defined to be the supremum exponential decay rate of the mean square decoding
error. This is upper bounded by the information-theoretic feedback capacity,
which is the supremum of the achievable rates. A sufficient condition is
provided under which the upper bound holds with equality. For the special class
of stationary Gaussian channels, a simple application of Bode's integral
formula shows that the feedback capacity, recently characterized by Kim, is
equal to the maximum instability that can be tolerated by the controller under
a given power constraint. Finally, the control mapping is generalized to the

challenging problem due to a huge number of possible subsequences. In this
paper we define this problem the linear detrending subsequence matching and
propose its efficient index-based solution. To this end, we first present a
notion of LD-windows (LD means linear detrending), which is obtained as
follows: we eliminate the linear trend from a subsequence rather than each
window itself and obtain LD-windows by dividing the subsequence into windows.
Using the LD-windows we then present a lower bounding theorem for the
index-based matching solution and formally prove its correctness. Based on the
lower bounding theorem, we next propose the index building and subsequence
matching algorithms for linear detrending subsequence matching.We finally show
the superiority of our index-based solution through extensive experiments.

recommender systems. These are: producing accurate recommendation, handling
many recommendations efficiently and coping with the vast growth of number of
participants in the system. Therefore, new recommender system technologies are
needed that can quickly produce high quality recommendations even for huge data
sets.
  To address these issues we have explored several collaborative filtering
techniques such as the item based approach, which identify relationship between
items and indirectly compute recommendations for users based on these
relationships. The user based approach was also studied, it identifies
relationships between users of similar tastes and computes recommendations
based on these relationships.
  In this paper, we introduce the topic of recommender system. It provides ways
to evaluate efficiency, scalability and accuracy of recommender system. The
paper also analyzes different algorithms of user based and item based
techniques for recommendation generation. Moreover, a simple experiment was
conducted using a data mining application -Weka- to apply data mining
algorithms to recommender system. We conclude by proposing our approach that
might enhance the quality of recommender systems.

such as the Chern number and its generalizations, is now a major issue for
realizing novel charge/spin responses in electron systems. We propose that a
simple optical means --subjecting to a driving laser field with circular
polarization, can be fruitfully incorporated to this end. Taking as a
prototypical example the two-band insulator first considered by Haldane, we
show how the electron system can be tuned through phases associated with
different Chern numbers as the laser intensity is adiabatically swept; i.e., a
photo-induced analog of the quantum Hall plateau transition. The implications
of our findings includes the possibility of laser-tuning a conventional
insulator into a quantum spin Hall system.

members of the Hyades open cluster in order to set constraints on
self-consistent evolutionary models including radiative and turbulent
diffusion. A spectral synthesis iterative procedure was applied to derive the
abundances from selected high quality lines in high resolution high
signal-to-noise spectra obtained with SOPHIE and AURELIE at the Observatoire de
Haute Provence. The abundance patterns found for A and F stars in the Hyades
resemble those observed in Coma Berenices and Pleiades clusters. In graphs
representing the abundances versus the effective temperature, A stars often
display abundances much more scattered around their mean values than the
coolest F stars do. Large star-to-star variations are detected in the Hyades A
dwarfs in their abundances of C, Na, Sc, Fe, Ni, Sr, Y and Zr, which we
interpret as evidence of transport processes competing with radiative
diffusion. In A and Am stars, the abundances of Cr, Ni, Sr, Y and Zr are found
to be correlated with that of iron as in the Pleiades and in Coma Berenices.
The ratios [C/Fe] and [O/Fe] are found to be anticorrelated with [Fe/H] as in
Coma Berenices. All Am stars in the Hyades are deficient in C and O and
overabundant in elements heavier than Fe but not all are deficient in calcium
and/or scandium. The F stars have solar abundances for almost all elements
except for Si. The overall shape of the abundance pattern of the slow rotator
HD30210 cannot be entirely reproduced by models including radiative diffusion
and different amounts of turbulent diffusion. While part of the discrepancies
between derived and predicted abundances could be due to non-LTE effects, the
inclusion of competing processes such as rotational mixing and/or mass loss
seems necessary in order to improve the agreement between the observed and
predicted abundance patterns.

fully polarized phase at large field, the classical model possesses a multitude
of phases that break the translational symmetry which in the dimer language,

The extrapolation of the semiclassical energies suggests that the plaquette

Contemporaneous UV and X-ray observations with the Swift satellite in November
2006 are also reported. PKS 0548-322 is detected for the first time in the VHE
band with H.E.S.S. We measure an excess of 216 gamma-rays corresponding to a
significance of 5.6 standard deviations. The photon spectrum of the source is
described by a power-law, with a photon index of Gamma=2.86 +/- 0.34 (stat) +/-
0.10 (sys). The integral flux above 200 GeV is 1.3 % of the flux of the Crab

state with respect to previous observations. The spectral energy distribution
can be reproduced using a simple one-zone synchrotron self Compton model, with

excitation on frequency correspond to minimal roton energy relaxes and forms a
wide pedestal. Alongside these fast processes, there are also slower processes
of rotons' scattering by microwave photons taking place, which lead to
additional absorption of energy of resonant microwaves and to the appearance of
a narrow resonant peak on the background of a wide pedestal. The theoretical

mappings (ODM), that take special properties of the cubic potential into
account. The various ODM are adapted to different regimes of the coupling
constant. We also determine a large number of terms of the strong coupling
expansion by resumming the weak-coupling expansion using the ODM, demonstrating
the interpolation between the two regimes made possible by this summation
method.

semiconductors, catalysis, sensors, clinical diagnosis and treatments, one
fundamental issue that is crucial to these applications remains theoretically
equivocal- the reversible carrier-type transition between n- and p-type
conductivities during gas-sensing operations. Here, we give unambiguous and
rigorous theoretical analysis in order to explain why and how the oxygen
vacancies affect the n-type semiconductors, a-Fe2O3 and Fe doped SnO2 in which
they are both electronically and chemically transformed into a p-type
semiconductor. Furthermore, this reversible transition also occurs on the oxide
surfaces during gas-sensing operation due to physisorbed gas molecules (without
any chemical reaction). We make use of the ionization energy theory and its
renormalized ionic displacement polarizability functional to reclassify,
generalize and to explain the concept of carrier-type transition in solids, and
during gas-sensing operation. The origin of such a transition is associated to
the change in ionic polarizability and the valence states of cations in the
presence of (a) oxygen vacancies and (b) physisorped gas molecules.

observable in a bimodal valence distribution. Dependent on a saturated or a

further identify scenarios where collective emotions only appear once or in a
repeated manner. The analytical results are illustrated by agent-based computer

  (211 pages, 35 figures)",,,,"astro-ph.CO hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Inflationary cosmology is the leading explanation of the very early universe.
Many different models of inflation have been constructed which fit current
observational data. In this work theoretical and numerical methods for
constraining the parameter space of a wide class of such models are described.
First, string-theoretic models with large non-Gaussian signatures are
investigated. An upper bound is placed on the amplitude of primordial
gravitational waves produced by ultra-violet Dirac-Born-Infeld inflation. In
all but the most finely tuned cases, this bound is incompatible with a lower
bound derived for inflationary models which exhibit a red spectrum and
detectable non-Gaussianity. By analysing general non-canonical actions, a class
of models is found which can evade the upper bound when the phase speed of
perturbations is small. The multi-coincident brane scenario with a finite
number of branes is one such model. For models with a potentially observable
gravitational wave spectrum the number of coincident branes is shown to take
only small values. The second method of constraining inflationary models is the
numerical calculation of second order perturbations for a general class of
single field models. The Klein-Gordon equation at second order, written in
terms of scalar field variations only, is numerically solved. The slow roll
version of the second order source term is used and the method is shown to be
extendable to the full equation. This procedure allows the evolution of second
order perturbations in general and the calculation of the non-Gaussianity
parameter in cases where there is no analytical solution available.

experimental laboratories where the electron degeneracy is taking place on a

band (>10 keV) thanks to sensitive hard X-ray missions.
  Aims. From X-ray spectroscopy, we estimate the masses of nearby WDs in
moderately-magnetized CVs, or Intermediate Polars (IPs).
  Methods. Using the Suzaku satellite, we aquired wide-band spectra of 17 IPs,
covering 3-50 keV. An accretion column model of Suleimanov et al. (2005) and an
optically-thin thermal emission code were used to construct a spectral emission
model of IPs with resolved Fe emission lines. By simultaneously fitting the Fe
line complex and the hard X-ray continuum of individual spectra, the shock
temperature and the WD mass were determined with a better accuracy than in
previous studies.
  Results. We determined the WD masses of the 17 IPs with statistical fitting
errors of ~0.1-0.2 Msun in many cases. The WD mass of a recently-found IP, IGR
J17195-4100, was also estimated for the first time (1.03+0.24-0.22 Msun). The
average WD mass of the sample is 0.88 \pm 0.25 Msun. When our results were
compared with previous X-ray mass determinations, we found significant
deviation in a few systems although the reason of this is unclear. The iron
abundance of the accreting gas was also estimated, and confirmed the previously
reported sub-solar tendency in all sources with better accuracy.

emission due to WIMP annihilation in the halo of the LMC at two radio
frequencies, 1.4 and 4.8 GHz, and compare it to the observed emission, in order
to impose constraints in the WIMP mass vs. annihilation cross section plane. We
use available Faraday rotation data from background sources to estimate the
magnitude of the magnetic field in different regions of the LMC's disc, where
we calculate the radio signal due to dark matter annihilation. We account for
the e+ e- energy losses due to synchrotron, Inverse Compton Scattering and
bremsstrahlung, using the observed hydrogen and dust temperature distribution
on the LMC to estimate their efficiency. The extensive use of observations,
allied with conservative choices adopted in all the steps of the calculation,
allow us to obtain very realistic constraints.

nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor couplings, $J_1=(1-p)J$ and $J_2=pJ$, $J>0$,
is studied in the entire range of the parameter $p$. Mori's projection operator
technique is used as a method which retains the rotation symmetry of spin
components and does not anticipate any magnetic ordering. For zero temperature
four second-order phase transitions are observed. At $p\approx 0.038$ the
ground state is transformed from the long-range ordered $120^\circ$ spin
structure into a state with short-range ordering, which in its turn is changed
to a long-range ordered state with the ordering vector ${\bf
Q^\prime}=\left(0,-\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{3}}\right)$ at $p\approx 0.2$. For
$p\approx 0.5$ a new transition to a state with a short-range order occurs.
This state has a large correlation length which continuously grows with $p$
until the establishment of a long-range order happens at $p \approx 0.65$. In
the range $0.5<p<0.96$, the ordering vector is incommensurate. With growing $p$
it moves along the line ${\bf Q'-Q}_1$ to the point ${\bf
Q}_1=\left(0,-\frac{4\pi}{3\sqrt{3}}\right)$ which is reached at $p\approx
0.96$. The obtained state with a long-range order can be conceived as three
interpenetrating sublattices with the $120^\circ$ spin structure on each of
them.

theoretically describe this phenomenon. Including the statistical distribution
of potential barrier heights for these traps leads to a power-law dependence of
the resistance as a function of time, under a constant bias voltage. This model
also predicts a power-law relation of the hysteresis as a function of the
voltage sweep frequency. Experimental transport results strongly support this
model and in particular confirm the expected power laws dependencies of

that the moduli space of Calabi-Yau threefolds coming from eight planes in

hyperelliptic locus, over which the variation of Hodge structures is naturally
isomorphic to wedge product of a variation of Hodge structures of weight one.
It turns out the hyperelliptic locus does not extend to a Shimura subvariety of
type III (Siegel space) within the moduli space. Besides general Hodge theory,
representation theory and computational commutative algebra, one of the proofs
depends on a new result on the tensor product decomposition of complex

long-range interactions. It describes the motion of $N$ particles moving on a
ring, coupled through an infinite-range potential. The model has a second order
phase transition at the energy $U_c=3/4$ and its dynamics is exactly described
by the Vlasov equation in the $N \to \infty$ limit. Its chaotic properties have
been investigated in the past, but the determination of the scaling with $N$ of
the Lyapunov Spectrum (LS) of the model remains a challenging open problem. We
here show that the $N^{-1/3}$ scaling of the Maximal Lyapunov Exponent (MLE),
found in previous numerical and analytical studies, extends to the full LS; not
only, scaling is ""precocious"" for the LS, meaning that it becomes manifest for
a much smaller number of particles than the one needed to check the scaling for
the MLE. Besides that, the $N^{-1/3}$ scaling appears to be valid not only for
$U>U_c$, as suggested by theoretical approaches based on a random matrix
approximation, but also below a threshold energy $U_t \approx 0.2$. Using a
recently proposed method (GALI) devised to rapidly check the chaotic or regular
nature of an orbit, we find that $U_t$ is also the energy at which a sharp
transition from {\it weak} to {\it strong} chaos is present in the phase-space
of the model. Around this energy the phase of the vector order parameter of the
model becomes strongly time dependent, inducing a significant untrapping of
particles from a nonlinear resonance.

for non-canonical processes that modify the surface abundances of low- and
intermediate-mass stars beyond the predictions of standard stellar theory. We
study the effects of thermohaline instability and rotation-induced mixing in
the 1-4 Msun range at solar metallicity. We present evolutionary models by
considering both thermohaline and rotation-induced mixing in stellar interior.
We discuss the effects of these processes on the chemical properties of stars
from the zero age main sequence up to the end of the second dredge-up on the
early-AGB for intermediate-mass stars and up to the AGB tip for low-mass stars.
Model predictions are compared to observational data for
lithium,12C/13C,[N/C],[Na/Fe],16O/17O, and 16O/18O in Galactic open clusters
and in field stars with well-defined evolutionary status,as well as in
planetary nebulae. Thermohaline mixing simultaneously accounts for the observed
behaviour of 12C/13C,[N/C], and lithium in low-mass stars that are more
luminous than the RGB bump, and its efficiency is increasing with decreasing
initial stellar mass. On the TP-AGB,thermohaline mixing leads to lithium
production, although the 7Li yields remain negative. Although the 3He stellar
yields are much reduced thanks to this process, we find that solar-metallicity,
low-mass stars remain net 3He producers. Rotation-induced mixing is found to
change the stellar structure so that in the mass range between \sim 1.5 and 2.2
Msun the thermohaline instability occurs earlier on the red giant branch than
in non-rotating models. Finally rotation accounts for the observed star-to-star
abundance variations at a given evolutionary status, and is necessary to
explain the features of CN-processed material in intermediate-mass stars.

analysis methods in gravitational wave detection are based on matched
filtering. Gravitational wave detection is a typical example of weak signal
detection, and this weak signal is buried in strong instrument noise. So it
seems attractable if we can take advantage of stochastic resonance. But
unfortunately, almost all of the stochastic resonance theory is based on
Fourier transformation and has no relation to matched filtering. In this paper
we try to relate stochastic resonance to matched filtering. Our results show
that stochastic resonance can indeed be combined with matched filtering for
both periodic and non-periodic input signal. This encouraging result will be
the first step to apply stochastic resonance to matched filtering in
gravitational wave detection. In addition, based on matched filtering, we
firstly proposed a novel measurement method for stochastic resonance which is

proximity of the vertices. Common link prediction functions for general graphs
are defined using paths of length two between two nodes. Since in a bipartite

functions do not apply to bipartite graphs. Instead, a certain class of graph

graphs when the positive-semidefinite kernel constraint is relaxed. This
generalization is realized by the odd component of the underlying spectral
transformation. This construction leads to several new link prediction

non-magnetic impurities is investigated within the framework of a generalized
quantum dimer model (QDM) describing a) the valence bond crystal (VBC), b) the
dimer liquid and c) the critical region on equal footing. Following the
approach by Ralko et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 117204 (2008)] for the square
and triangular lattices, we introduce the (minimal) extension of the QDM on the
Kagome lattice to account for spontaneous creation of mobile S=1/2 spinons at
finite magnetic field. Modulations of the dimer density (at zero or finite
magnetic field) and of the local field-induced magnetization in the vicinity of
impurities are computed using Lanczos Exact Diagonalization techniques on small
clusters (48 and 75 sites). The VBC is clearly revealed from its pinning by
impurities, while, in the dimer liquid, crystallization around impurities
involves only two neighboring dimers. We also find that a next-nearest-neighbor
ferromagnetic coupling favors VBC order. Unexpectedly, a small size
spinon-impurity bound state appears in some region of the the dimer liquid
phase. In contrast, in the VBC phase the spinon delocalizes within a large
region around the impurity, revealing the weakness of the VBC confining
potential. Lastly, we observe that an impurity concentration as small as 4%
enhances dimerization substantially. These results are confronted to the
Valence Bond Glass scenario [R.R.P. Singh, Phys. Rev. Lett. 104, 177203 (2010)]
and implications to the interpretation of the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
spectra of the Herbertsmithite compound are outlined.

anisotropic inner form of G. The Jacquet-Langlands correspondence between
irreducible complex representations of D^* and discrete series of G does not
behave well with respect to reduction modulo l\neq p. However we show that the
Langlands-Jacquet transfer, from the Grothendieck group of admissible l-adic
representations of G to that of D^* is compatible with congruences and reduces
modulo l to a similar transfer for l-modular representations, which moreover
can be characterized by some Brauer characters identities. Studying more
carefully this transfer, we deduce a bijection between irreducible l-modular
representations of D^* and ""super-Speh"" l-modular representations of G. Via
reduction mod l, this latter bijection is compatible with the classical
Jacquet-Langlands correspondence composed with the Zelevinsky involution. Our
arguments rely on Vigneras' classification of representations of G. Finally we
discuss the question whether our Langlands-Jacquet transfer sends irreducibles
to effective virtual representations up to a sign. This presumably boils down
to some unknown properties of parabolic affine Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials.

results recently released by the Belle collaboration for charged as well as
neutral pion pairs and also by recent progress in the determination of the
low-energy $\pi\pi$ scattering amplitude. Applicability of this formalism is
extended beyond 1 GeV by taking into account inelasticity due to $K\bar{K}$ . A
modified MO representation is derived which has the advantage that all
polynomial ambiguities are collected into the subtraction constants and have
simple relations to pion polarizabilities. It is obtained by treating
differently the exactly known QED Born term and the other components of the
left-hand cut. These components are approximated by a sum over resonances. All
resonances up to spin two and masses up to $\simeq1.3$ GeV are included. The
tensor contributions to the left-hand cut are found to be numerically
important. We perform fits to the data imposing chiral constraints, in
particular, using a model independent sum rule result on the $p^6$ chiral
coupling $c_{34}$. Such theoretical constraints are necessary because the
experimental errors are dominantly systematic. Results on further $p^6$
couplings and pion dipole and quadrupole polarizabilities are then derived from
the fit. The relevance of the new data for distinguishing between two possible
scenarios of isospin breaking in the $f_0(980)$ region is discussed.

in real space (r-space) and those delocalized in momentum-space (k-space)
generates exotic electronic states called 'heavy fermions'. In URu2Si2 these
effects begin at temperatures around 55K but they are suddenly altered by an
unidentified electronic phase transition at To = 17.5 K. Whether this is
conventional ordering of the k-space states, or a change in the hybridization
of the r-space states at each U atom, is unknown. Here we use spectroscopic
imaging scanning tunnelling microscopy (SI-STM) to image the evolution of
URuSi2 electronic structure simultaneously in r-space and k-space. Above To,
the 'Fano lattice' electronic structure predicted for Kondo screening of a
magnetic lattice is revealed. Below To, a partial energy gap without any
associated density-wave signatures emerges from this Fano lattice.
Heavy-quasiparticle interference imaging within this gap reveals its cause as
the rapid splitting below To of a light k-space band into two new heavy fermion
bands. Thus, the URu2Si2 'hidden order' state emerges directly from the Fano
lattice electronic structure and exhibits characteristics, not of a
conventional density wave, but of sudden alterations in both the hybridization
at each U atom and the associated heavy fermion states.

interior cone angles being integer multiples of $2\pi$, determines a holonomy
representation of the fundamental group. We ask, conversely, when a
representation of the fundamental group is the holonomy of a hyperbolic
cone-manifold structure. In this paper we build upon previous work with
punctured tori to prove results for higher genus surfaces. Our techniques
construct fundamental domains for hyperbolic cone-manifold structures, from the
geometry of a representation. Central to these techniques are the Euler class
of a representation, the group $\widetilde{PSL_2\R}$, the twist of hyperbolic
isometries, and character varieties. We consider the action of the outer
automorphism and related groups on the character variety, which is
measure-preserving with respect to a natural measure derived from its
symplectic structure, and ergodic in certain regions. Under various hypotheses,
we almost surely or surely obtain a hyperbolic cone-manifold structure with
prescribed holonomy.
