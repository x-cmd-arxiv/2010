rapidly rotating G giant using a magnetohydrodynamic model that was originally
developed for the solar corona in order to capture the more realistic,
non-potential coronal structure. We drive the simulation with surface maps for
the radial magnetic field obtained from a stellar dynamo model of the FK Com
system. This enables us to obtain the coronal structure for different field
topologies representing different periods of time. We find that the corona of
such an FK Com-like star, including the large scale coronal loops, is dominated
by a strong toroidal component of the magnetic field. This is a result of part
of the field being dragged by the radial outflow, while the other part remains
attached to the rapidly rotating stellar surface. This tangling of the magnetic
field,in addition to a reduction in the radial flow component, leads to a
flattening of the gas density profile with distance in the inner part of the
corona. The three-dimensional simulation provides a global view of the coronal
structure. Some aspects of the results, such as the toroidal wrapping of the
magnetic field, should also be applicable to coronae on fast rotators in
general, which our study shows can be considerably different from the
well-studied and well-observed solar corona. Studying the global structure of
such coronae should also lead to a better understanding of their related
stellar processes, such as flares and coronal mass ejections, and in
particular, should lead to an improved understanding of mass and angular
momentum loss from such systems.

construction of applications from components, by separating the issues of
transmission policy from component definition and implementation. This promotes
a greater degree of software reuse than is possible using traditional
middleware environments. Whilst component technologies are usually presented as
a mechanism for promoting reuse, reuse is often limited due to design choices
that permeate component implementation. The programmer has no direct control
over inter-address-space parameter passing semantics: it is fixed by the
distributed application's structure, based on the remote accessibility of the
components. Using traditional middleware tools and environments, the
application designer may be forced to use an unnatural encoding of application
level semantics since application parameter passing semantics are tightly
coupled with the component deployment topology. This paper describes how
inter-address-space parameter passing semantics may be decided independently of
component implementation. Transmission policy may be dynamically defined on a
per-class, per-method or per-parameter basis.

influence of amorphous boundary conditions on a confined system. By using a
swap Monte Carlo algorithm we measure the equilibration time of a liquid

point-to-set correlation length is the natural size of the cooperatively

a standard, nonswap dynamics, has the opposite behavior, showing a very steep
increase when the cavity size is decreased. We try to reconcile this difference
by discussing the possible hybridization between MCT and activated processes,

properties, which we call semi-compactons. These minimize energy in the degree

several semi-compactons, it is shown that every homotopy class has linearly
stable solutions of arbitrarily high, but quantized, energy. For various other
choices of potential, compactons are constructed with support in a closed disk,

compactons, and complicated superpositions in which several closed string-like
compactons are nested within one another. The constructions make heavy use of
the invariance of the model under area-preserving diffeomorphisms, and of a
topological lower energy bound, both of which are established in a general
geometric setting. All the solutions presented are classical, that is, they are

supernova (SN) neutrino and antineutrino spectra. These spectral splits depend
not only on the mass hierarchy of the neutrinos but also on the initial
relative flux composition. Observation of spectral splits in a future galactic
supernova signal is expected to throw light on the mass hierarchy pattern of
the neutrinos. However, since the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background (DSNB)
comprises of a superposition of neutrino fluxes from all past supernovae, and
since different supernovae are expected to have slightly different initial
fluxes, it is pertinent to check if the hierarchy dependent signature of
collective oscillations can survive this averaging of the flux spectra. Since
the actual distribution of SN with initial relative flux spectra of the
neutrinos and antineutrinos is unknown, we assume a log-normal distribution for
them. We study the dependence of the hierarchy sensitivity to the mean and
variance of the log-normal distribution function. We find that the hierarchy
sensitivity depends crucially on the mean value of the relative initial
luminosity. The effect of the width is to reduce the hierarchy sensitivity for
all values of the mean initial relative luminosity. We find that in the very
small mixing angle ($\theta_{13}$) limit considering only statistical errors
even for very moderate values of variance, there is almost no detectable
hierarchy sensitivity if the mean relative luminosities of $\nu_e$ and
$\bar\nu_e$ are greater than 1.

cluster SN rates, the uncertainties are dominated by small-number statistics.
The SN rate in this redshift bin is consistent with the SN rate in clusters at
lower redshifts (to within the uncertainties), and shows that there is, at
most, only a slight increase of cluster SN rate with increasing redshift. The
low and fairly constant SN Ia rate out to z~1 implies that the bulk of the iron
mass in clusters was already in place by z~1. The recently observed doubling of
iron abundances in the intracluster medium between z=1 and 0, if real, is
likely the result of redistribution of existing iron, rather than new
production of iron.

dependence of the symmetry energy and the high density component of the
equation of state, properties that are at present poorly constrained by
existing laboratory data. Particularly attractive is the study of the fraction
of the moment of inertia contained in the solid crust. Analytic treatments of
the crustal moment of inertia reveal a high sensitivity to the transition
pressure at the core-crust interface. This may suggest the existence of a
strong correlation between the density dependence of the symmetry energy and
the crustal moment of inertia. However, no correlation was found. We conclude
that constraining the density dependence of the symmetry energy - through, for

significant bound on either the transition pressure or the crustal moment of

gravitational wave signals from astrophysical sources, including those from

galaxies have central black holes that sink to the center of the merged galaxy
and begin to orbit one another and emit gravitational waves. Some galaxy
evolution models predict that the binary black hole system will enter the LISA
band with significant orbital eccentricity, while other models suggest that the
orbits will already have circularized. Using a full seventeen parameter
waveform model that includes the effects of orbital eccentricity, spin
precession and higher harmonics, we investigate how well the source parameters
can be inferred from simulated LISA data. Defining the reference eccentricity
as the value one year before merger, we find that for typical LISA sources, it
will be possible to measure the eccentricity to an accuracy of parts in a
thousand. The accuracy with which the eccentricity can be measured depends only
very weakly on the eccentricity, making it possible to distinguish circular
orbits from those with very small eccentricities. LISA measurements of the
orbital eccentricity can help constraints theories of galaxy mergers in the
early universe. Failing to account for the eccentricity in the waveform
modeling can lead to a loss of signal power and bias the estimation of
parameters such as the black hole masses and spins.

oscillations (QPOs) observed in a number of accreting black-hole systems. These
modes are subject to global instabilities due to wave absorption at the
corotation resonance (where the wave pattern frequency $\omega/m$ equals the
disc rotation rate $\Omega$), when the fluid vortensity,
$\zeta=\kappa^2/(2\Omega\Sigma)$ (where $\kappa$ and $\Sigma$ are the radial
epicyclic frequency and disc surface density, respectively), has a positive
gradient. We investigate the effects of disc magnetic fields on the wave
absorption at corotation and the related wave super-reflection of the
corotation barrier, and on the overstability of disc p-modes. For discs with a
pure toroidal field, the corotation resonance is split into two magnetic
resonances, where the wave frequency in the corotating frame of the fluid,
$\tomega=\omega-m\Omega$, matches the slow magnetosonic wave frequency.
Significant wave energy/angular momentum absorption occurs at both magnetic
resonances, but with opposite signs. The combined effect of the two magnetic
resonances is to reduce the super-reflection and the growth rate of the
overstable p-modes. We show that even a subthermal toroidal field may suppress
the overstability of hydrodynamic (B=0) p-modes. For accretion discs with mixed
(toroidal and vertical) magnetic fields, two additional Alfven resonances
appear, where $\tomega$ matches the local Alfven wave frequency. They further
reduce the growth rate of p-modes. Our results suggest that in order for the
non-axisymmetric p-modes to be a viable candidate for the observed
high-frequency QPOs, the disc magnetic field must be appreciably subthermal, or
other mode excitation mechanisms are at work.

of the topology of its polygonal isodensity contours, without introducing any
free numerical parameter. Besides this new approach, we also employ the
traditional approaches of smoothing the galaxy distribution with a Gaussian of
fixed width, or by adaptively smoothing with a kernel that encloses a constant
number of neighboring galaxies. Our results show that the Delaunay-based method
extracts the largest amount of topological information. Unlike the traditional
approach for genus statistics, it is able to discriminate between the different
theoretical galaxy catalogues analyzed here, both in real space and in redshift
space, even though they are based on the same underlying simulation model. In
particular, the DTFE approach detects with high confidence a discrepancy of one
of the semi-analytic models studied here compared with the SDSS data, while the
other models are found to be consistent.

we propose a class of protocols that limit the performance gain which nodes can

which nodes collect signals about the actions of other nodes over a period of

compute this self-force highly accurately (relative error of $\ltsim 10^{-6}$)
and efficiently, and I describe techniques for doing this and for obtaining and
validating error estimates for the computation. I use an
adaptive-mesh-refinement (AMR) time-domain numerical integration of the
perturbation equations in the Barack-Ori mode-sum regularization formalism;
this is efficient, yet allows easy generalization to arbitrary particle orbits.
I focus on the model problem of a scalar particle in a circular geodesic orbit
in Schwarzschild spacetime.
  The mode-sum formalism gives the self-force as an infinite sum of regularized
spherical-harmonic modes $\sum_{\ell=0}^\infty F_{\ell,\reg}$, with
$F_{\ell,\reg}$ (and an ""internal"" error estimate) computed numerically for
$\ell \ltsim 30$ and estimated for larger~$\ell$ by fitting an asymptotic
""tail"" series. Here I validate the internal error estimates for the individual
$F_{\ell,\reg}$ using a large set of numerical self-force computations of
widely-varying accuracies. I present numerical evidence that the actual
numerical errors in $F_{\ell,\reg}$ for different~$\ell$ are at most weakly
correlated, so the usual statistical error estimates are valid for computing
the self-force. I show that the tail fit is numerically ill-conditioned, but
this can be mostly alleviated by renormalizing the basis functions to have
similar magnitudes.
  Using AMR, fixed mesh refinement, and extended-precision floating-point
arithmetic, I obtain the (contravariant) radial component of the self-force for
a particle in a circular geodesic orbit of areal radius $r = 10M$ to within
$1$~ppm relative error.

of quasars are widely used to quantify their radiative output, although such
estimates are affected by a myriad of uncertainties, such as the generally
unknown line-of-sight angle to the central engine. In order to shed light on
these issues, we investigate the state-of-the-art models of Hubeny et al. that
describe the continuum spectrum of thin accretion discs and include
relativistic effects. We explore the bolometric corrections as a function of
mass accretion rates, black hole masses and viewing angles, restricted to the
parameter space expected for type-1 quasars. We find that a nonlinear
relationship log L_bol=A + B log(lambda L_lambda) with B<=0.9 is favoured by
the models and becomes tighter as the wavelength decreases. We calculate from
the model the bolometric corrections corresponding to the wavelengths lambda =
1450A, 3000A and 5100A. In particular, for lambda=3000A we find A=9.24 +- 0.77
and B=0.81 +- 0.02. We demonstrate that the often-made assumption that quasars
emit isotropically may lead to severe systematic errors in the determination of
L_bol, when using the method of integrating the ""big blue bump"" spectrum. For a
typical viewing angle of ~30 degrees to the quasar central engine, we obtain
that the value of L_bol resulting from the isotropy assumption has a systematic
error of ~30% high compared to the value of L_bol which incorporates the
anisotropic emission of the accretion disc. These results are of direct
relevance to observational determinations of the bolometric luminosities of
quasars, and may be used to improve such estimates.

radical Vorono\""i tessellation, we find the variance of the local volume
fraction $\phi$ monotonically decreases as the system becomes more dense,
independent of boundary condition and $\mu$. We examine the universality and
origins of this trend using experiments and the recent granocentric model
\cite{Clusel-2009-GMR,Corwin-2010-MRP}, modified to draw particle locations
from an arbitrary distribution ${\cal P}(s)$ of neighbor distances $s$. The
mean and variance of the observed ${\cal P}(s)$ are described by a single
length scale controlled by $\bar \phi$. Through the granocentric model, we
observe that diverse functional forms of ${\cal P}(s)$ all produce the trend of
decreasing fluctuations, but only the experimentally-observed ${\cal P}(s)$
provides quantitative agreement with the measured $\phi$ fluctuations. Thus, we
find that both ${\cal P}(s)$ and ${\cal P}(\phi)$ encode similar information
about the ensemble of observed packings, and are connected to each other by the
local granocentric model.

$\sim$15$-$25\% lower driving neutrino luminosity than 2D. Moreover, we find
that the delay to explosion for a given neutrino luminosity is always shorter
in 3D than 2D, sometimes by many hundreds of milliseconds. The magnitude of
this dimensional effect is much larger than the purported magnitude of a
variety of other effects, such as nuclear burning, inelastic scattering, or
general relativity, which are sometimes invoked to bridge the gap between the
current ambiguous and uncertain theoretical situation and the fact of robust
supernova explosions. Since real supernovae occur in three dimensions, our
finding may be an important step towards unraveling one of the most problematic
puzzles in stellar astrophysics. In addition, even though in 3D we do see
pre-explosion instabilities and blast asymmetries, unlike the situation in 2D,
we do not see an obvious axially-symmetric dipolar shock oscillation. Rather,
the free energy available to power instabilites seems to be shared by more and
more degrees of freedom as the dimension increases. Hence, the strong dipolar
axisymmetry seen in 2D and previously identified as a fundamental

Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) far ultraviolet (FUV) images of the Ly-alpha
and continuum emission of the luminous emission-line nebulae in 7 BCGs found to
have an infrared excess. We confirm that the BCGs are actively forming stars
suggesting that the IR excess seen in these BCGs is indeed associated with star
formation. The FUV continuum emission extends over a region of ~7-28 kpc
(largest linear size) and even larger in Ly-alpha. The young stellar population
required by the FUV observations would produce a significant fraction of the
ionizing photons required to power the emission line nebulae. Star formation
rates estimated from the FUV continuum range from ~3 to ~14 times lower than
those estimated from the IR, however both the Balmer decrement in the central
few arcseconds and detection of CO in most of these galaxies imply that there
are regions of high extinction that could have absorbed much of the FUV
continuum. Analysis of archival VLA observations reveals compact radio sources
in all 7 BCGs and kpc scale jets in Abell 1835 and RXJ 2129+00. The four
galaxies with archival deep Chandra observations exhibit asymmetric X-ray
emission, the peaks of which are offset from the center of the BCGs by ~10 kpc
on average. A low feedback state for the AGN could allow increased condensation
of the hot gas into the center of the galaxy and the feeding of star formation.

62 My periodicity in terrestrial fossil biodiversity. It has been suggested
that the infall of our galaxy toward the Virgo cluster could generate an
extragalactic shock, accelerating charged particles and exposing the earth to a
flux of high energy cosmic rays (HECRs). The oscillation of the Sun
perpendicular to the galactic plane could induce 62 My periodicity in the HECR
flux on the Earth, with a magnitude much higher than the Galactic cosmic ray
change we see in a solar cycle. This mechanism could potentially explain the
observed 62 My periodicity in terrestrial biodiversity over the past 500 My. In
addition to direct effects on life from secondaries, HECRs induced air showers
ionize the atmosphere leading to changes in atmospheric chemistry and
microphysical processes that can lead to cloud formation including low altitude
cloud cover. An increase in ionization changes the global electric circuit
which could enhance the formation of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) through
microphysical processes such as electroscavenging and ion mediated nucleation,
leading to an increase in the cloud cover. This could increase the albedo and
reduce the solar flux reaching the ground, reducing the global temperature.
Using an existing model, we have calculated the enhancement in atmospheric
ionization at low altitudes resulting from exposure to HECRs. We use a
conservative model to estimate the change in low altitude cloud cover from this
increased ionization.

unique solution of a nonlinear integro-differential equation of Kac type. This

with near zero entropy and clearly resolve the high entropy rings separating
them although their width is of the order of only a single lattice site.
Furthermore, we show how a Mott insulator melts for increasing temperatures due
to a proliferation of local defects. Our experiments open a new avenue for the

as well as for quantum information processing with ultracold atoms. Using the
high spatial resolution, it is now possible to directly address individual

level still allowed by present data) but it is ignored in the CMB analysis, the
sound horizon and cosmological parameters determination is biased, and, as a
consequence, future surveys may incorrectly suggest deviations from a

fairly strong conditions on the geometry of the tiling (specifically, the inner
tube formula for each generator of the fractal spray is required to be
polynomial). Now we extend and strengthen the tube formula by removing the
conditions on the geometry of the generators, and also by giving a proof which
holds pointwise, rather than distributionally.
  Hence, our results for fractal sprays extend to higher dimensions the
pointwise tube formula for (1-dimensional) fractal strings obtained earlier by
Lapidus and van Frankenhuijsen.
  Our pointwise tube formulas are expressed as a sum of the residues of the
""tubular zeta function"" of the fractal spray in $\mathbb{R}^d$. This sum ranges
over the complex dimensions of the spray, that is, over the poles of the
geometric zeta function of the underlying fractal string and the integers

matter, in bimetric-MOND (BIMOND) cosmology. I concentrate on
matter-twin-matter-symmetric versions of BIMOND, and assume that, on average,
the universe is symmetrically populated in the two sectors. MOND effects are
absent in an exactly symmetric universe, apart from the appearance of a
cosmological constant, Lambda~(a0/c)^2. MOND effects-local and cosmological-do
enter when density inhomogeneities that differ in the two sectors appear and
develop. MOND later takes its standard form in systems that are islands
dominated by pure matter. I derive the nonrelativistic equations governing
small-scale fluctuation growth. The equations split into two uncoupled systems,
one for the sum, the other for the difference, of the fluctuations in the two
sectors. The former is governed strictly by Newtonian dynamics. The latter is
governed by MOND dynamics, which entails stronger gravity, and nonlinearity
even for the smallest of perturbations. These cause the difference to grow
faster than the sum, conducing to matter-twin-matter segregation. The
nonlinearity also causes interaction between nested perturbations on different
scales. Because matter and twin matter (TM) repel each other in the MOND
regime, matter inhomogeneities grow not only by their own self gravity, but
also through shepherding by flanking TM overdensitie. The relative importance
of gravity and pressure in the MOND system depends also on the strength of the
perturbation. The development of structure in the universe, in either sector,
thus depends crucially on two initial fluctuation spectra: that of matter alone
and that of the matter-TM difference. I also discuss the back reaction on
cosmology of BIMOND effects that appear as ""phantom matter"" resulting from
inhomogeneity differences between the two sectors.

diffuse gas in various places in the universe, such as in our Galaxy's disk and
halo, high velocity clouds (HVCs), external galaxies, and the intergalactic
medium. One possible mechanism for producing high ions is turbulent mixing of
cool gas with hotter gas in locations where these gases slide past each other.
By using hydrodynamic simulations with radiative cooling and non-equilibrium
ionization (NEI) calculations, we investigate the physical properties of
turbulent mixing layers and the production of high ions. We find that most of
the mixing occurs on the hot side of the hot/cool interface and that the mixed
region separates into a tepid zone containing radiatively cooled, C IV-rich gas
and a hotter zone which is rich in C IV, N V, and O VI. Mixing occurs faster
than ionization or recombination, making the mixed gas a better source of C IV,
N V, and O VI in our NEI simulations than in our collisional ionization
equilibrium (CIE) simulations. In addition, the gas radiatively cools faster
than the ions recombine, which also allows large numbers of high ions to linger
in the NEI simulations. For these reasons, our NEI calculations predict more
high ions than our CIE calculations predict. We also simulate various initial
configurations of turbulent mixing layers and discuss their results. We compare
the results of our simulations with observations and other models, including
other turbulent mixing calculations. The ratios of C IV to N V and N V to O VI
are in reasonable agreement with the averages calculated from observations of
the halo. There is a great deal of variation from sightline to sightline and
with time in our simulations. Such spatial and temporal variation may explain
some of the variation seen among observations.

disk-bearing stars associated with the cloud, after detecting their excesses in
NIR bands from J band to 8.0 micron. In this paper, we study in detail the
nature of a subsample of disk-bearing stars that show peculiar characteristics.
They appear older than the other members in the V vs. V-I diagram, and/or they
have one or more IRAC colors at pure photospheric values, despite showing NIR
excesses, when optical and infrared colors are compared. We confirm the
membership of these stars to M16 by a spectroscopic analysis. The physical
properties of these stars with disks are studied by comparing their spectral
energy distributions (SEDs) with the SEDs predicted by models of T-Tauri stars
with disks and envelopes. We show that the age of these stars estimated from
the V vs. V-I diagram is unreliable since their V-I colors are altered by the
light scattered by the disk into the line of sight. Only in a few cases their
SEDs are compatible with models with excesses in V band caused by optical
veiling. Candidate members with disks and photospheric IRAC colors are selected
by the used NIR disk diagnostic, which is sensitive to moderate excesses, such
as those produced by disks with low masses. In 1/3 of these cases, scattering
of stellar flux by the disks can also be invoked. The photospheric light
scattered by the disk grains into the line of sight can affect the derivation
of physical parameters of ClassII stars from photometric optical and NIR data.

chemistry or quantum biology. In simple systems, the photon-photon interaction
can be determined analytically. However, it becomes challenging to obtain it
for more compex systems. Therefore, we show here how to measure strong
non-linearities via allowing the sample to interact with a weakly pumped
quantized leaking optical mode. We found that the detected mean-photon number
versus pump-field frequency shows several peaks. Interestingly, the interval
between neighbour peaks equals the photon-photon interaction potential.
Furthermore, the system exhibits sub-Poissonian photon statistics, entanglement
and photon switching with less than one photon. Finally, we connect our study
with existing related experiments.

branch (AGB) stars is detected outside of the previously identified young and
intermediate age star clusters in the outer disk. The brightest AGB stars have
M_K > -8, and the AGB luminosity function (LF) is well-matched by model LFs
that assume ages < 1 Gyr. The specific star formation rate (SFR) during the
past few Gyr estimated from AGB star counts is consistent with that computed
from mid-infrared observations of star clusters at similar radii, and it is
concluded that the disruption timescale for star clusters in the outer disk is
<< 1 Gyr. The luminosity function and specific frequency of AGB stars varies
with radius, in a manner that is indicative of lower luminosity-weighted ages
at larger radii. Modest numbers of red supergiants are also found, indicating
that there has been star formation during the past 100 Myr, while the ratio of
C stars to M giants is consistent with that expected for a solar metallicity
system that has experienced a constant SFR for the past few Gyrs.

parabolic law L = 2At + . . . . Mott explained this for monovalent carriers by
assuming that monovalent ions and electrons are the bulk charge carriers, and
that their number fluxes vary as t^{-1/2} at sufficiently long t. In this
theory no charge is present in the bulk, and surface charges were not
discussed. However, it can be analyzed in terms of a discharging capacitor,
with the oxide surfaces as the plates. The theory is inconsistent because the
field decreases, corresponding to discharge, but there is no net current to
cause discharge. The present work, which also includes non-monovalent carriers,
systematically extends the theory and obtains the discharge current. Because
the Planck-Nernst equations are nonlinear (although Gauss's Law and the
continuity equations are linear) this leads to a systematic order-by-order
expansion in powers of t^{-1/2} for the number currents, concentrations, and
electric field during oxide growth. At higher order the bulk develops a
non-zero charge density, with a corresponding non-uniform net current, and
there are corrections to the electric field and the ion currents. The second
order correction to ion current implies a logarithmic term in the thickness of
the oxide layer: L = (2At)^{1/2} + B ln t + . . . . It would be of interest to
verify this result with high-precision measurements.

the formation of giant planets. For simplicity, most models presently assume
that the growth of planetary embryos occurs in isolation. We explore how the
simultaneous growth of two embryos at the present locations of Jupiter and
Saturn affects the outcome of planetary formation. We model planet formation on
the basis of the core accretion scenario and include several key physical
ingredients. We consider a protoplanetary gas disk that exponentially decays
with time. For planetesimals, we allow for a distribution of sizes from 100~m
to 100~km with most of the mass in the smaller objects. We include planetesimal
migration as well as different profiles for the surface density $\Sigma$ of the
disk. The core growth is computed in the framework of the oligarchic growth
regime and includes the viscous enhancement of the planetesimal capture
cross-section. Planet migration is ignored. By comparing calculations assuming
formation of embryos in isolation to calculations with simultaneous embryo
growth, we find that the growth of one embryo generally significantly affects
the other. This occurs in spite of the feeding zones of each planet never
overlapping. The results may be classified as a function of the gas surface
density profile $\Sigma$: if $\Sigma \propto r^{-3/2}$ and the protoplanetary
disk is rather massive, Jupiter's formation inhibits the growth of Saturn. If
$\Sigma \propto r^{-1}$ isolated and simultaneous formation lead to very
similar outcomes; in the the case of $\Sigma \propto r^{-1/2}$ Saturn grows
faster and induces a density wave that later acclerates the formation of
Jupiter. Our results indicate that the simultaneous growth of several embryos
impacts the final outcome and should be taken into account by planet formation
models.

global hydrodynamical instability, the so-called Papaloizou-Pringle (PP)
instability, arising from the interaction of non-axisymmetric waves across the
corotation radius, where the wave pattern speed matches the fluid rotation
rate. However, accretion tori produced in various astrophysical situations
(e.g., collapsars and neutron star binary mergers) are likely to be highly
magnetized. We study the effect of magnetic fields on the PP instability in
incompressible tori with various magnetic strengths and structures. In general,
toroidal magnetic fields have significant effects on the PP instability: For
thin tori (with the fractional width relative to the outer torus radius much
less than unity), the instability is suppressed at large field strengths with
the corresponding toroidal Alfven speed $v_{A\phi}\go 0.2r\Omega$ (where
$\Omega$ is the flow rotation rate). For thicker tori (with the fractional
width of order 0.4 or larger), which are hydrodynamically stable, the
instability sets in for sufficiently strong magnetic fields (with $v_{A\phi}\go
0.2 r\Omega$). Our results suggest that highly magnetized accretion tori may be
subjected to global instability even when it is stable against the usual
magneto-rotational instability.

minor fraction of the stellar mass budget which is made up primarily of old
stars. Furthermore, recent implementations of stellar population (SP) models
reveal that the inclusion of a more complete treatment of the thermally
pulsating asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) phase to SP models greatly increases
the NIR flux for SPs of ages 0.2-2 Gyr. Comparing the optical--NIR colors
predicted from population synthesis fitting, using models which do not include

optical--NIR colors are too red compared to the model predictions. However,

simulations. Parker instability arises from the presence of a magnetic field in
a plasma, wherein the magnetic buoyant pressure expels the gas and cause the
gas to move along the field lines. The process is thought to induce the
formation of giant molecular clouds in the Galaxy. In this study, the effects
of cosmic-ray (CR) diffusion are examined. The ISM at equilibrium is assumed to
comprise a plasma fluid and a CR fluid at various temperatures, with a uniform
magnetic field passing through it in the azimuthal direction of the Galactic
disk. After a small perturbation, the unstable gas aggregates at the footpoint
of the magnetic fields and forms dense blobs. The growth rate of the
instability increases with the strength of the CR diffusion. The formation of

in a model theory of quantum gravity. Specifically, we construct the
decoherence functional for the Wheeler-DeWitt quantization of a flat
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmology with a free, massless, minimally coupled
scalar field, thus providing a complete decoherent histories formulation for
this quantum cosmological model. The decoherence functional is applied to study
predictions concerning the model's Dirac (relational) observables; the behavior
of semiclassical states and superpositions of such states; and to study the
singular behavior of quantum Wheeler-DeWitt universes. Within this framework,
rigorous formulae are given for calculating the corresponding probabilities
from the wave function when those probabilities may be consistently defined,
thus replacing earlier heuristics for interpreting the wave function of the
universe with explicit constructions. It is shown according to a rigorously
formulated standard, and in a quantum-mechanically consistent way, that in this
quantization these models are generically singular. Independent of the choice
of state we show that the probability for these Wheeler-DeWitt quantum
universes to ever encounter a singularity is unity. In addition, the relation
between histories formulations of quantum theory and relational Dirac
observables is clarified.

however, assume solid-body rotation periods based on Voyager 2 measurements of
periodic variations in the planets' radio signals and of fits to the planets'
magnetic fields; 17.24h and 16.11h for Uranus and Neptune, respectively. The
realization that the radio period of Saturn does not represent the planet's
deep interior rotation and the complexity of the magnetic fields of Uranus and
Neptune raise the possibility that the Voyager 2 radio and magnetic periods
might not represent the deep interior rotation periods of the ice giants.
Moreover, if there is deep differential rotation within Uranus and Neptune no
single solid-body rotation period could characterize the bulk rotation of the
planets. We use wind and shape data to investigate the rotation of Uranus and
Neptune. The shapes (flattening) of the ice giants are not measured, but only
inferred from atmospheric wind speeds and radio occultation measurements at a
single latitude. The inferred oblateness values of Uranus and Neptune do not
correspond to bodies rotating with the Voyager rotation periods. Minimization
of wind velocities or dynamic heights of the 1 bar isosurfaces, constrained by
the single occultation radii and gravitational coefficients of the planets,
leads to solid-body rotation periods of ~16.58h for Uranus and ~17.46h for
Neptune. Uranus might be rotating faster and Neptune slower than Voyager
rotation speeds. We derive shapes for the planets based on these rotation
rates. Wind velocities with respect to these rotation periods are essentially
identical on Uranus and Neptune and wind speeds are slower than previously
thought. Alternatively, if we interpret wind measurements in terms of
differential rotation on cylinders there are essentially no residual
atmospheric winds.

shed new light on intracluster gas physics and greatly help to identify the

operating in the interior of solar-analog stars. We investigate whether the
large dispersion in the observed lithium abundances of solar-analog stars can
be explained by the depth behavior of the outer convective zone masses, within
the framework of the standard convection model based on the local mixing-length
theory. We also aims to analyze the link between rotation and lithium abundance
in solar-analog stars. We computed a new extensive grid of stellar evolutionary
models, applicable to solar-analog stars, for a finely discretized set of mass
and metallicity. From these models, the stellar mass, age, and mass depth of
the outer convective zone were estimated for 117 solar-analog stars, using Teff
and [Fe/H] available in the literature, and the new HIPPARCOS trigonometric
parallax measurements. We determine the age and mass of the outer convective
zone for a bona fide sample of 117 solar-analog stars. No significant on-to-one
correlation is found between the computed convection zone mass and published
lithium abundance, indicating that the large A(Li) dispersion in solar analogs
cannot be explained by the classical framework of envelope convective mixing
coupled with lithium depletion at the bottom of the convection zone. These
results illustrate the need for an extra-mixing process to explain lithium
behavior in solar-analog stars, such as, shear mixing caused by differential
rotation. To derive a more realistic definition of solar-analog stars, as well
as solar-twin, it seems important to consider the inner physical properties of
stars, such as convection, hence rotation and magnetic properties.

Since the neutrino energy is very low the smaller of the two oscillation

can be so small that the full oscillation can take place inside the detector
and one may determine very accurately the neutrino oscillation parameters.
  Since in this case the oscillation probability is proportional to theta13,
one can measure or set a better limit on the unknown parameter theta13. This is
quite important, since, if this mixing angle vanishes, there is not going to be
CP violation in the leptonic sector. The best way to detect it is by measuring
electron recoils in neutrino-electron scattering. One, however, has to pay the
price that the expected counting rates are very small. Thus one needs a very
intensive neutrino source and a large detector with as low as possible energy
threshold and high energy and position resolution. Both spherical gaseous and
cylindrical liquid detectors are studied. Different source candidates are
considered.

optimal solution to the problem of sampling the state space of statistical
mechanical systems according to the relative importance of configurations for
the partition function or thermal averages of interest. While this is true in
terms of its simplicity and universal applicability, the resulting approach
suffers from the presence of temporal correlations of successive samples
naturally implied by the Markov chain underlying the importance-sampling
simulation. In many situations, these autocorrelations are moderate and can be
easily accounted for by an appropriately adapted analysis of simulation data.
They turn out to be a major hurdle, however, in the vicinity of phase
transitions or for systems with complex free-energy landscapes. The critical
slowing down close to continuous transitions is most efficiently reduced by the
application of cluster algorithms, where they are available. For first-order
transitions and disordered systems, on the other hand, macroscopic energy
barriers need to be overcome to prevent dynamic ergodicity breaking. In this
situation, generalized-ensemble techniques such as the multicanonical
simulation method can effect impressive speedups, allowing to sample the full
free-energy landscape. The Potts model features continuous as well as
first-order phase transitions and is thus a prototypic example for studying
phase transitions and new algorithmic approaches. I discuss the possibilities
of bringing together cluster and generalized-ensemble methods to combine the
benefits of both techniques. The resulting algorithm allows for the efficient
estimation of the random-cluster partition function encoding the information of
all Potts models, even with a non-integer number of states, for all
temperatures in a single simulation run per system size.
