from a fusion of a gluon and a charm quark from the colliding protons. The
rapidity distribution of the yield is evaluated in the central region relevant
for the ATLAS and CMS detectors, as well as in the more forward region relevant
for the ALICE and LHC-b detectors. The results obtained here are compatible
with those of other approaches within the range of the theoretical
uncertainties which are admittedly very large. This suggests that the ""mere""
measurements of the yield at the LHC will not help disentangle between the
different possible quarkonium production mechanisms.

large change to the down-quark distribution and/or large nuclear corrections to
be applied when fitting to deuterium structure function data, while the CDF W

employ new analytical methods to prove that as the number of users K grows

  Simulations and observations of the microwave sky are of great importance for
understanding the Universe that we reside in. Specifically, knowledge of the
CMB and its foregrounds - including the SZ effect from clusters of galaxies and
radio point sources - tell us about the Universe on its very largest scales,
and also what the Universe is made of.
  We describe the creation of software to carry out large numbers of virtual
sky simulations. The simulations include the CMB, SZ effect and point sources,
and are designed to examine the effects of point sources and the SZ effect on
present and recent observations of the CMB. Utilizing sets of 1,000
simulations, we find that the power spectrum resulting from the SZ effect is
expected to have a larger standard deviation by a factor of 3 than would be
expected from purely Gaussian realizations, and is significantly skewed towards
increased values for the power spectrum. The effects of the clustering of
galaxy clusters, residual point sources and uncertainties in the gas physics
are also investigated, as are the implications for the excess power measured in
the CMB power spectrum by the CBI and BIMA.
  We carry out end-to-end simulations for OCRA-p observations of point sources.
The introduction of simulated 1/ f noise significantly reduces the predicted
ability of the instruments to observe weak sources by measuring the sources for
long periods of time.
  The OCRA-p receiver has been used to observe point sources in the VSA fields
so that they can be subtracted from observations of the CMB power spectrum. We
find that these point sources are split between steep and flat spectrum
sources. We have also observed 550 CRATES flat spectrum radio sources, which
will be useful for comparison to Planck satellite observations. Finally, the
assembly and commissioning of the OCRA-F receiver is outlined.

the structure and dynamics of these protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks
are the key to the functional understanding of cells. In the last years,
large-scale PPI networks of several model organisms were investigated.
Methodological improvements now allow the analysis of PPI networks of multiple
organisms simultaneously as well as the direct modeling of ancestral networks.
This provides the opportunity to challenge existing assumptions on network
evolution. We utilized present-day PPI networks from integrated datasets of
seven model organisms and developed a theoretical and bioinformatic framework
for studying the evolutionary dynamics of PPI networks. A novel filtering
approach using percolation analysis was developed to remove low confidence
interactions based on topological constraints. We then reconstructed the
ancient PPI networks of different ancestors, for which the ancestral proteomes,
as well as the ancestral interactions, were inferred. Ancestral proteins were
reconstructed using orthologous groups on different evolutionary levels. A
stochastic approach, using the duplication-divergence model, was developed for
estimating the probabilities of ancient interactions from today's PPI networks.
The growth rates for nodes, edges, sizes and modularities of the networks
indicate multiplicative growth and are consistent with the results from
independent static analysis. Our results support the duplication-divergence
model of evolution and indicate fractality and multiplicative growth as general
properties of the PPI network structure and dynamics.

let X be a discrete G-spectrum. If H and K are closed subgroups of G, with H
normal in K, then, in general, the K/H-spectrum X^{hH} is not known to be a
continuous K/H-spectrum, so that it is not known (in general) how to define the
iterated homotopy fixed point spectrum (X^{hH})^{hK/H}. To address this
situation, we define homotopy fixed points for delta-discrete G-spectra and
show that the setting of delta-discrete G-spectra gives a good framework within
which to work. In particular, we show that by using delta-discrete K/H-spectra,
there is always an iterated homotopy fixed point spectrum, denoted
(X^{hH})^{h_\delta K/H}, and it is just X^{hK}. Additionally, we show that for
any delta-discrete G-spectrum Y, (Y^{h_\delta H})^{h_\delta K/H} \simeq
Y^{h_\delta K}. Furthermore, if G is an arbitrary profinite group, there is a
delta-discrete G-spectrum {X_\delta} that is equivalent to X and, though X^{hH}
is not even known in general to have a K/H-action, there is always an
equivalence ((X_\delta)^{h_\delta H})^{h_\delta K/H} \simeq
(X_\delta)^{h_\delta K}. Therefore, delta-discrete L-spectra, by letting L
equal H, K, and K/H, give a way of resolving undesired deficiencies in our
understanding of homotopy fixed points for discrete G-spectra.

inspired by three different cosmological models; features in the primordial
potential, resonant type non-Gaussianities and deviation from the standard
Bunch Davies vacuum. In order to put constraints on their bispectra, a logical
first step is to put these into factorized form which can be achieved via the
recently proposed method of polynomial basis expansion on the tetrahedral
domain. We investigate the viability of such an expansion for the oscillatory
bispectra and find that one needs an increasing number of orthonormal mode
functions to achieve significant correlation between the expansion and the
original spectrum as a function of their frequency. To reduce the number of
modes required, we propose a basis consisting of Fourier functions
orthonormalized on the tetrahedral domain. We show that the use of Fourier mode
functions instead of polynomial mode functions can lead to the necessary
factorizability with the use of only 1/5 of the total number of modes required
to reconstruct the bispectra with polynomial mode functions. Moreover, from an
observational perspective, the expansion has unique signatures depending on the
orientation of the oscillation due to a resonance effect between the mode
functions and the original spectrum. This effect opens the possibility to
extract informa- tion about both the frequency of the bispectrum as well as its
shape while considering only a limited number of modes. The resonance effect is
independent of the phase of the reconstructed bispectrum suggesting Fourier
mode extraction could be an efficient way to detect oscillatory bispectra in
the data.

of the symbolic dynamics of this first return map.
  In the case of the regular octagon, the case we study, the arithmetic graphs
associated to periodic orbits are polygonal paths in R^8. We are interested in
the asymptotic shapes of these polygonal paths, as the period tends to
infinity. We show that the rescaled limit of essentially any sequence of these

appropriate nonlinear equivalence problem, and that this problem can be solved
formally by using the Lie transform framework to linearize it. According to
this approach, we derive formal coordinate transformations associated with both
first-order and higher-order averaging, which result in more manageable
formulae than the classical ones.
  Using these transformations, it is possible to correct the solution of an
averaged system by recovering the oscillatory components of the original
non-averaged system. In this framework, the inverse transformations are also
defined explicitly by formal series; they allow the estimation of appropriate
initial data for each higher-order averaged system, respecting the equivalence
relation.
  Finally, we show how these methods can be used for identifying and computing
periodic solutions for a very large class of nonlinear systems with
time-periodic forcing. We test the validity of our approach by analyzing both

reflect the lack of robustness due to the specific configurations in graphs

system dynamics of quantum systems. In particular, within the framework of
collision models we introduce the quantum analogue of thermalization process
called quantum homogenization and simulate quantum decoherence processes. These
dynamics are driven by partial swaps and controlled unitary collisions,
respectively. We show that collision models can be used to prepare multipartite
entangled states. Partial swap dynamics generates W-type of entanglement
saturating the CKW inequalities, whereas the decoherence collision models
creates GHZ-type of entangled states. The considered evolution of a system in a
sequence of collisions is described by a discrete semigroup E_1,...,E_n.
Interpolating this discrete points within the set of quantum channels we derive
for both processes the corresponding Lindblad master equations. In particular,
we argue that collision models can be used as simulators of arbitrary Markovian
dynamics, however, the inverse is not true.

plus dead time process, is given. The design problem considers three essential
requirements of control problems, namely load disturbance rejection, setpoint
regulation and robustness of closed-loop system against model uncertainties.
The primary design goal is to optimize load disturbance rejection. Robustness
is guaranteed by requiring that the maximum sensitivity is less than or equal
to a specified value. In the first step, PI controller parameters are
determined such that the IAE criterion to a load disturbance step is minimized
and the robustness constraint on maximum sensitivity is satisfied. Using a
structure with two degrees of freedom which introduces an extra parameter, the
setpoint weight, good setpoint regulation is achieved in the second step. The
main advantage of the proposed method is its simplicity. Once the equivalent
first order plus dead time model is determined, the PI parameters are
explicitly given by a set of tuning formulae. In order to show the performance
and effectiveness of the proposed tuning formulae, they are applied to three
simulation examples.

techniques for the rare-event analysis of heavy-tailed stochastic processes.
Our changes-of-measure are parameterized by a family of distributions admitting
a mixture form. We exploit our methodology to achieve two types of results.
First, we construct Monte Carlo estimators that are strongly efficient (i.e.
have bounded relative mean squared error as the event of interest becomes
rare). These estimators are used to estimate both rare-event probabilities of
interest and associated conditional expectations. We emphasize that our
techniques allow us to control the expected termination time of the Monte Carlo
algorithm even if the conditional expected stopping time (under the original
distribution) given the event of interest is infinity -- a situation that
sometimes occurs in heavy-tailed settings. Second, the mixture family serves as
a good approximation (in total variation) of the conditional distribution of
the whole process given the rare event of interest. The convenient form of the
mixture family allows us to obtain, as a corollary, functional conditional
central limit theorems that extend classical results in the literature. We
illustrate our methodology in the context of the ruin probability $P(\sup_n S_n
>b)$, where $S_n$ is a random walk with heavy-tailed increments that have
negative drift. Our techniques are based on the use of Lyapunov inequalities
for variance control and termination time. The conditional limit theorems
combine the application of Lyapunov bounds with coupling arguments.

previously determined analytical approximations from single stellar population
(SSP) models fitted to multi-band optical and near-infrared photometry for
galaxies with a known redshift. Galaxies with the smallest Dn4000-the galaxies
with the youngest stellar populations-are always attenuated and/or contain

consider classical open strings coupled to general relativity in Poincare AdS5
backgrounds. We compute the linear gravitational backreaction of a static
string extending up to the Poincare horizon, and deduce the potential energy
between two such strings. If spacetime is non-compact, we find that the
gravitational potential energy between parallel open strings is independent of
the strings' inertial masses and goes like 1/r at large distance r. If the
space transverse to the D3-branes is suitably compactified, a collective mode
of the graviton propagates usual four-dimensional gravity. In that case the
backreaction of the D3-branes induces a correction to the Newtonian potential
energy that violates the equivalence principle. The observed enhancement of the
gravitational attraction is specific to string theory; there is no similar
effect for point-particles.

non-linear structure formation, redshift-space distortions and galaxy bias. We
empirically test the robustness of neutrino mass results to these effects by
separately analyzing power spectra of red and blue galaxies from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-II) Data Release 7 (DR7), combined with the CMB
five-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP5) data. We consider
fitting for a range of maximum wavenumber k using twelve different galaxy bias
models. For example, using a new model based on perturbation theory and
including redshift space distortions (Saito et al. 2009), the all-galaxy power
spectrum combined with WMAP5 for a wavenumber range of k<0.2 Mpc/h yields 95%
CL sum(m_nu)<0.46 eV. The red and blue galaxy power spectra give 0.41 and 0.63
eV respectively for this model. Using mock catalogues, we find the expected
difference in these limits assuming a true neutrino mass of zero is 0.10 + or -
0.14 eV. Thus the difference of 0.22 eV between upper limits on neutrino mass
for red and blue galaxies is approximately 1 sigma from the expected value. We
find similar results for the other models and k ranges tested. This indicates
good agreement for current data but hints at possible issues for
next-generation surveys. Being able to perform such systematic tests is
advantageous, and future surveys would benefit by including broad galaxy
populations and luminosities that enable such a decomposition.

the observed clouds. We calculate and present the column-density distributions
of three clouds, modeled with very different techniques, none of which is
dominated by supersonic turbulence. The first star-forming cloud is simulated
using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH); in this case gravity, opposed only
by thermal-pressure forces, drives the evolution. The second cloud is
magnetically subcritical with subsonic turbulence, simulated using nonideal
MHD; in this case the evolution is due to gravitationally-driven ambipolar
diffusion. The third cloud is isothermal, self-gravitating, and has a smooth
density distribution analytically approximated with a uniform inner region and
an r^-2 profile at larger radii. We show that in all three cases the
column-density distributions are lognormal. Power-law tails develop only at
late times (or, in the case of the smooth analytic profile, for strongly
centrally concentrated configurations), when gravity dominates all opposing
forces. It therefore follows that lognormal column-density distributions are
generic features of diverse model clouds, and should not be interpreted as
being a consequence of supersonic turbulence.

frequency-dependent SZ temperature fluctuations, with thermal (TSZ) and kinetic
(KSZ) contributions, are calculated by tracing through a dark matter
simulation, processed to include gas in dark matter halos and in the
filamentary intergalactic medium. Different halo gas models are compared to
study how star formation, energetic feedback, and nonthermal pressure support
influence the angular power spectrum. The standard model has been calibrated to
reproduce the stellar and gas fractions and X-ray scaling relations measured
from low redshift clusters and groups. The other models illustrate the current
theoretical and empirical uncertainties relating to properties of the
intracluster medium. Relative to the standard model, their angular power
spectra differ by approximately 50% (TSZ), 20% (KSZ), and 40% (SZ at 148 GHz)
for l=3000, sigma_8=0.8, and homogeneous reionization at z=10. The angular
power spectrum decreases in amplitude as gas mass and binding energy is removed
through star formation, and as gas is pushed out to larger radii by energetic
feedback. With nonthermal pressure support, less pressure is required to
maintain hydrostatic equilibrium, thus reducing the thermal contribution to the
SZ power. We also calculate the SZ templates as a function of sigma_8 and
quantify this dependence. Assuming C_l is proprotional to (sigma_8/0.8)^alpha,
the effective scaling index ranges from 7<alpha_tsz<9, 4.5<alpha_ksz<5.5, and
6.5<alpha_sz(148 GHz)<8 at l=3000 for 0.6<sigma_8<1. The template spectra are

can, under ap- propriate circumstances, be in a quantum topologically ordered
state supporting exotic Majorana excitations which follow non-Abelian
statistics. The key to the quantum topological order is the coexistence of
spin-orbit coupling with proximity-induced s-wave superconductivity and an
externally-induced Zeeman coupling of the spins. For the Zeeman coupling below
a critical value, the system is a non-topological (proximity-induced) s-wave
superconductor. However, for a range of Zeeman coupling above the critical
value, the lowest energy excited state inside a vortex is a zero-energy
Majorana fermion state. The system, thus, has entered into a non-Abelian s-wave
superconducting state via a topological quantum phase transition (TQPT) tuned
by the Zeeman coupling. In the one-dimensional version of the same structure
and for the Zeeman coupling above the critical value, there are localized
Majorana zero-energy modes at the two ends of a semiconducting quantum
nanowire. In this case, the Zeeman coupling can be induced more easily by an
external magnetic field parallel to the wire, obviating the need for a magnetic
insulator. We show that, despite the fact that the superconducting pair
potential in the nanowire is explicitly s-wave, tunneling of electrons to the
ends of the wire reveals a pronounced zero-bias peak. Such a peak is absent
when the Zeeman coupling is below its critical value, i.e., the nanowire is in
the non-topological s-wave superconducting state. We argue that the observation
of this zero-bias tunneling peak in the semiconductor nanowire is possibly the
simplest and clearest experiment proposed so far to unambiguously detect a
Majorana fermion mode in a condensed matter system.

metallicity or alpha-elements (especially for our intermediate mass samples).
This demonstrates that our subsamples are consistent with pure passive evolving
(i.e. no chemical evolution) and represent a homogeneous population over this

times in a concordance Lambda CDM universe. We also see that our most massive

galaxies have n>2, i.e. they are bulge-dominated systems. The spectra for the
three samples confirm that the Halpha-selected galaxies have the highest D4000
values and are, on average, nearly twice as old as the Sersic-selected samples.
With the advent of multi-object near-infrared spectrographs, Halpha alone can
be used to reliably isolate truly quiescent galaxies dominated by evolved
stellar populations at any epoch from z~0 up to z~2.

the choice of targets for optical follow-ups that results in a flux-limited

a bias in the observed distribution and cannot explain the absence of black
holes in the 2-5 solar mass range. On the high mass end, we argue that the
rapid decline in the inferred distribution may be the result of the particular
evolutionary channel followed by low-mass X-ray binaries. This is consistent
with the presence of high-mass black holes in the persistent, high-mass X-ray
binary sources. If the paucity of low-mass black holes is caused by a sudden
decrease of the supernova explosion energy with increasing progenitor mass,
this would have observable implications for ongoing transient surveys that

the proposed approach identifies complexity of software immediately after

compares well with established complexity measures. Finally the trend can be

system forms at the LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface and, strikingly, both
superconducts and displays indications of hysteretic magnetoresistance. An
essential step for device applications is establishing the ability to vary the
electronic conductivity of the electron system by means of a gate. We have
fabricated metallic top gates above a conductive interface to vary the electron
density at the interface. By monitoring capacitance and electric field
penetration, we are able to tune the charge carrier density and establish that
we can completely deplete the metallic interface with small voltages. Moreover,
at low carrier densities, the capacitance is significantly enhanced beyond the
geometric capacitance for the structure. In the same low density region, the
metallic interface overscreens an external electric field. We attribute these
observations to a negative compressibility of the electronic system at the
interface. Similar phenomena have been observed previously in semiconducting
two-dimensional electronic systems. The observed compressibility result is
consistent with the interface containing a system of mobile electrons in two

sample of 92 pre-main sequence stars mostly belonging to the infrared Class II,
including 13 accreting transition disk objects and 14 objects driving jets and
outflows. We find several significant correlations between L[NeII] and stellar
parameters, in particular LX and the wind mass loss rate, dM/dt. Most
correlations are, however, strongly dominated by systematic scatter. While
there is a positive correlation between L[NeII] and LX, the stellar mass
accretion rate, dMacc/dt, induces a correlation only if we combine the largely
different subsets of jet sources and stars without jets. Our results suggest
that L[NeII] is bi-modally distributed, with separate distributions for the two
subsamples. The jet sources show systematically higher L[NeII], by 1-2 orders
of magnitude with respect to objects without jets. Jet-driving stars also tend
to show higher mass accretion rates. We therefore hypothesize that the trend
with dMacc/dt reflects a trend with dM/dt that is more physically relevant for
[NeII] emission. L[NeII] measured for objects without known outflows and jets
is found to agree with simplified calculations of [NeII] emission from disk
surface layers if the measured stellar X-rays are responsible for heating and
ionizing of the gas. The large scatter in L[NeII] may be introduced by
variations of disk properties and the irradiation spectrum, as previously
suggested. The systematically enhanced [NeII] flux from jet sources clearly
suggests a role for the jets themselves, as previously demonstrated by a
spatially resolved observation of the outflow system in the T Tau triple.

been shown to correlate with metallicity. We demonstrate that previous
empirical photometric calibrations of M dwarf metallicity exploiting this
correlation systematically underestimate or overestimate metallicity at the
extremes of their range. We improve upon previous calibrations in three ways.
We use both a volume-limited and kinematically-matched sample of F and G dwarfs
from the Geneva-Copehnagen Survey (GCS) to infer the mean metallicity of M
dwarfs in the Solar Neighborhood, we use theoretical models of M dwarf
interiors and atmospheres to determine the effect of metallicity on M dwarfs in
the V-K_s--M_Ks CMD, and we base our final calibration purely on
high-resolution spectroscopy of FGK primaries with M dwarf companions. As a
result, we explain an order of magnitude more of the variance in the
calibration sample than previous photometric calibrations. We
non-parametrically quantify the significance of the observation that M dwarfs
that host exoplanets are preferentially in a region of the V-K_s--M_Ks plane
populated by metal-rich M dwarfs. We find that the probability p that
planet-hosting M dwarfs are distributed across the V-K_s--M_Ks CMD in the same
way as field M dwarfs is p = 0.06 +/- 0.008. Interestingly, the subsample of M
dwarfs that host Neptune and sub-Neptune mass planets may also be
preferentially located in the region of the V-K_s--M_Ks plane populated by
high-metallicity M dwarfs. The probability of this occurrence by chance is p =
0.40 +/- 0.02, and this observation hints that low-mass planets may be more
likely to be found around metal-rich M dwarfs. An increased rate of low-mass
planet occurrence around metal-rich M dwarfs would be a natural consequence of
the core-accretion model of planet formation. (abridged)

spin-orbit misaligned in the plane of the sky. Unfortunately, the RM effect
only measures the angle between the orbit of a transiting exoplanet and the
spin of its host star projected in the plane of sky, leaving unconstrained the
compliment misalignment angle between the orbit of the planet and the spin of
its host star along the line of sight. I use a simple model of stellar rotation
benchmarked with observational data to statistically identify ten exoplanet
systems from a sample of 75 for which there is likely a significant degree of
misalignment along the line of sight between the orbit of the planet and the
spin of its host star. I find that HAT-P-7, HAT-P-14, HAT-P-16, HD 17156,
Kepler-5, Kepler-7, TrES-4, WASP-1, WASP-12, and WASP-14 are likely spin-orbit
misaligned along the line of sight. All ten systems have host stellar masses
M_star in the range 1.2 M_sun <= M_star <= 1.5 M_sun, and the probability of
this occurrence by chance is less than one in ten thousand. In addition, the
planets in the candidate misaligned systems are preferentially massive and
eccentric. The coupled distribution of misalignment from the RM effect and from
this anaylsis suggests that transiting exoplanets are more likely to be
spin-orbit aligned than expected given predictions for a transiting planet
population produced entirely by planet-planet scattering or Kozai cycles and
tidal friction. For that reason, there are likely two populations of close-in
exoplanet systems: a population of aligned systems and a population of
apparently misaligned systems in which the processes that lead to misalignment
or to the survival of misaligned systems operate more efficiently in systems
with massive stars and planets. (abridged)

Temporal correlations speed up outbreaks, especially in the early phase,
compared to randomized contact structures. The time-ordering and the network

of HIV, not even if individuals were sexually active during the acute

lepton flavor-violating (LFV) processes are accessible at MEG and future

which disfavors either thermal leptogenesis or neutralino dark matter.
Non-thermal leptogenesis in the preheating phase from SUSY flat directions
relaxes the gravitino problem by lowering the required reheat temperature. The
baryon asymmetry can then be explained while preserving neutralino dark matter,

observed in current or future experiments.

resonant absorption. They are systematically blue-shifted, with a velocity

We detect variability of the lines on both EWs and blue-shifted velocities
among different observations even on time-scales as short as a few days,
possibly suggesting somewhat compact absorbers. Moreover, we find no
significant correlation between the cosmological red-shifts of the sources and
the lines blue-shifted velocities, ruling out any systematic contamination by
local absorption. If we define Ultra-fast Outflows (UFOs) those highly ionized
absorbers with outflow velocities higher than 10^4 km/s, then the majority of
the lines are consistent with being associated to UFOs and the fraction of
objects with detected UFOs in the whole sample is at least 35%. This fraction
is similar for Type 1 and Type 2 sources. The global covering fraction of the
absorbers is consequently estimated to be in the range C=0.4-0.6, thereby
implying large opening angles. These lines indicate that UFOs are a rather
common phenomenon observable in the central regions of these sources and they
are probably the direct signature of AGN accretion disk winds/ejecta. The
detailed photo-ionization modeling of these absorbers is presented in a

role played in climate dynamics by fluid-dynamical models; and (ii) to
contribute to the understanding and reduction of the uncertainties in future
climate-change projections. To illustrate the first point, we focus on the
large-scale, wind-driven flow of the mid-latitude oceans which contribute in a
crucial way to Earth's climate, and to changes therein. We study the
low-frequency variability (LFV) of the wind-driven, double-gyre circulation in
mid-latitude ocean basins, via the bifurcation sequence that leads from steady
states through periodic solutions and on to the chaotic, irregular flows
documented in the observations. This sequence involves local, pitchfork and
Hopf bifurcations, as well as global, homoclinic ones. The natural climate
variability induced by the LFV of the ocean circulation is but one of the
causes of uncertainties in climate projections. Another major cause of such
uncertainties could reside in the structural instability in the topological
sense, of the equations governing climate dynamics, including but not
restricted to those of atmospheric and ocean dynamics. We propose a novel
approach to understand, and possibly reduce, these uncertainties, based on the
concepts and methods of random dynamical systems theory. As a very first step,
we study the effect of noise on the topological classes of the Arnol'd family
of circle maps, a paradigmatic model of frequency locking as occurring in the
nonlinear interactions between the El Nino-Southern Oscillations (ENSO) and the
seasonal cycle. It is shown that the maps' fine-grained resonant landscape is
smoothed by the noise, thus permitting their coarse-grained classification.
This result is consistent with stabilizing effects of stochastic
parametrization obtained in modeling of ENSO phenomenon via some general
circulation models.

fields in 3+1 dimensions. The renormalizability of the theory requires that the
action of the scalar field contains terms with six spatial derivatives of the
field, i.e. in the UV, the classical action of the scalar field should preserve
the anisotropic scaling symmetry ($t \to L^{2z}t,$ $\vec{x} \to L^2 \vec{x}$,
with $z=3$) of the gravitational action. We discuss the renormalization
procedure based on adiabatic subtraction and dimensional regularization in the
weak field approximation. We verify that the divergent terms in the adiabatic
expansion of the expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor of the scalar
field contain up to six spatial derivatives, but do not contain more than two
time derivatives. We compute explicitly the counterterms needed for the
renormalization of the theory up to second adiabatic order and evaluate the
associated $\beta$ functions in the minimal subtraction scheme.

grouped, for example, in biological applications where assayed genes or
proteins can be grouped by biological roles or biological pathways. Common
statistical analysis methods such as ANOVA, factor analysis, and functional
modeling with basis sets also exhibit natural variable groupings. Existing
successful group variable selection methods such as Antoniadis and Fan (2001),
Yuan and Lin (2006) and Zhao, Rocha and Yu (2009) have the limitation of
selecting variables in an ""all-in-all-out"" fashion, i.e., when one variable in
a group is selected, all other variables in the same group are also selected.
In many real problems, however, we may want to keep the flexibility of
selecting variables within a group, such as in gene-set selection. In this
paper, we develop a new group variable selection method that not only removes
unimportant groups effectively, but also keeps the flexibility of selecting
variables within a group. We also show that the new method offers the potential
for achieving the theoretical ""oracle"" property as in Fan and Li (2001) and Fan

one way and the down spin electron goes the other, producing the coherent spin

GOODS-South field obtained with the InfraRed Spectrograph (IRS) on the Spitzer

- 0.5 mJy at 24 um) in two redshift bins (0.76-1.05 and 1.75-2.4) to sample the
major contributors to the cosmic infrared background at the most active epochs.
We estimate redshifts for 92% of the sample using PAH and Si absorption
features. Only few of these galaxies (5% at z~1 and 12% at z~2) have their
total infrared luminosity dominated by emission from AGN. The averaged mid-IR
spectra of the z~1 LIRGs and of the z~2 ULIRGs are very similar to the averaged
spectrum of local starbursts and HII-like ULIRGs, respectively. We find that
6.2um PAH equivalent widths reach a plateau of ~1 um for L(24 mu) < 1E11
L(sun). At higher luminosities, EW (6.2 mu) anti-correlates with L(24 um).
Intriguingly, high-z ULIRGs and SMG lie above the local EW (6.2 um) - L(24 um)
relationship suggesting that, at a given luminosity, high-z ULIRGs have AGN
contributions to their dust emission lower than those of local counterparts. A
quantitative analysis of their morphology shows that most of the luminous IR
galaxies have morphologies similar to those of IR-quiet galaxies at the same
redshift. All z~2 ULIRGs of our sample are IR-excess BzK galaxies and most of
them have L(FIR)/L(1600A) ratios higher than those of starburst galaxies at a
given UV slope. The ``IR excess'' (Daddi et al. 2007) is mostly due to strong
7.7 um PAH emission and under-estimation of UV dust extinction. On the basis of
the AGN-powered L (6 um) continuum measured directly from the mid-IR spectra,
we estimate an average intrinsic X-ray AGN luminosity of L(2-10 keV) = (0.1 +/-
0.6) 1E43 erg/s, a value substantially lower than the prediction by Daddi et
al. (2007).

whether the potentials give reasonable spectral indices $n_s$ and their running
$\alpha_s$'s by comparing with the recently released seven-year WMAP data. For

matter halo mass and velocity dispersion. We examine three aspects of SMBH
subgrid models: the choice of initial black hole seed mass, the test for
merging two black holes, and the frequency of applying the subgrid model. We
also examine the role that merging can play in determining the relations,
ignoring the complicating effects of SMBH-driven accretion and feedback. We
find that the choice of subgrid model can dramatically affect the black hole
merger rate, the cosmic SMBH mass density, and the low-redshift relations to
halo properties. We also find that it is possible to reproduce observations of
the low-redshift relations without accretion and feedback, depending on the
choice of subgrid model.

incremental computation of PageRank, personalized PageRank, and similar random
walk based methods (with focus on SALSA), on large-scale dynamically evolving
social networks. We assume that the graph of friendships is stored in
distributed shared memory, as is the case for large social networks such as
Twitter.
  For global PageRank, we assume that the social network has $n$ nodes, and $m$
adversarially chosen edges arrive in a random order. We show that with a reset
probability of $\epsilon$, the total work needed to maintain an accurate
estimate (using the Monte Carlo method) of the PageRank of every node at all
times is $O(\frac{n\ln m}{\epsilon^{2}})$. This is significantly better than
all known bounds for incremental PageRank. For instance, if we naively
recompute the PageRanks as each edge arrives, the simple power iteration method
needs $\Omega(\frac{m^2}{\ln(1/(1-\epsilon))})$ total time and the Monte Carlo
method needs $O(mn/\epsilon)$ total time; both are prohibitively expensive.
Furthermore, we also show that we can handle deletions equally efficiently.
  We then study the computation of the top $k$ personalized PageRanks starting
from a seed node, assuming that personalized PageRanks follow a power-law with
exponent $\alpha < 1$. We show that if we store $R>q\ln n$ random walks
starting from every node for large enough constant $q$ (using the approach
outlined for global PageRank), then the expected number of calls made to the
distributed social network database is $O(k/(R^{(1-\alpha)/\alpha}))$.
  We also present experimental results from the social networking site,
Twitter, verifying our assumptions and analyses. The overall result is that
this algorithm is fast enough for real-time queries over a dynamic social
network.

  these questions is ""no"", by a very simple imitation of the proof that
  Kolmogorov complexity is uncomputable based on the Berry paradox. These open
  questions have been removed",,,,"cs.CC cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We investigate the role of nondeterminism in Winfree's abstract Tile Assembly
Model (aTAM), which was conceived to model artificial molecular self-assembling
systems constructed from DNA. Of particular practical importance is to find
tile systems that minimize resources such as the number of distinct tile types,
each of which corresponds to a set of DNA strands that must be
custom-synthesized in actual molecular implementations of the aTAM. We seek to
identify to what extent the use of nondeterminism in tile systems affects the
resources required by such molecular shape-building algorithms.
  We first show a ""molecular computability theoretic"" result: there is an
infinite shape S that is uniquely assembled by a tile system but not by any
deterministic tile system. We then show an analogous phenomenon in the finitary
""molecular complexity theoretic"" case: there is a finite shape S that is
uniquely assembled by a tile system with c tile types, but every deterministic
tile system that uniquely assembles S has more than c tile types. In fact we
extend the technique to derive a stronger (classical complexity theoretic)
result, showing that the problem of finding the minimum number of tile types
that uniquely assemble a given finite shape is Sigma-P-2-complete. In contrast,
the problem of finding the minimum number of deterministic tile types that
uniquely assemble a shape was shown to be NP-complete by Adleman, Cheng, Goel,
Huang, Kempe, Moisset de Espan\'es, and Rothemund (Combinatorial Optimization
Problems in Self-Assembly, STOC 2002).
  The conclusion is that nondeterminism confers extra power to assemble a shape
from a small tile system, but unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses, it is
computationally more difficult to exploit this power by finding the size of the
smallest tile system, compared to finding the size of the smallest
deterministic tile system.

conditions, cooperation nonetheless evolves stably. One of these scenarios
utilizes the power of punishment to suppress free riders, but only if players
interact in a structured population where cooperators are likely to be
surrounded by other cooperators. Here we show that cooperation via punishment
can evolve even in well-mixed populations that play the ""public goods"" game, if
the synergy effect of cooperation is high enough. As the synergy is increased,
populations transition from defection to cooperation in a manner reminiscent of
a phase transition. If punishment is turned off, the critical synergy is
significantly higher, illustrating that (as shown before) punishment aids in
establishing cooperation. We also show that the critical point depends on the
mutation rate so that higher mutation rates discourage cooperation, as has been
observed before in the Prisoner's Dilemma.

correlated variations have not been explained yet reasonably at this stage.
Assuming that relativistic electrons are injected constantly at the location of
the compact object as a point source, and that they lose energy only by the
inverse Compton (IC) process, we calculate gamma-ray spectra and light curves
by the Monte Carlo method, including the full electromagnetic cascade process.
Moreover, we calculated X-ray spectra and light curves by using the resultant
electron distribution. As a result, we are able to reproduce qualitatively
spectra and light curves observed by HESS, Fermi, and Suzaku for the
inclination angle i = 30 dig and the index of injected electron distribution p
= 2.5. We conclude that TeV-GeV anticorrelation is due to anisotropic IC
scattering and anisotropic gamma-gamma absorption, and that TeV-X correlation
is due to the dependence of IC cooling time on orbital phases. In addition, the
constraint on the inclination angle implies that the compact object in LS5039

the global and local structure of complex fitness landscapes of interacting

found near other high peaks, corroborating Kauffman's ""Massif Central""

networks. These networks undergo a percolation phase transition as a function
of minimum peak height, which indicates that evolutionary trajectories that
take no more than two mutations to shift from peak to peak can span the entire

study the time evolution of open and inhomogeneous systems. The equation of
motion for the Green's function on the Keldysh contour is solved using
different conserving many-body approximations for the self-energy. Our
formulation incorporates basic conservation laws, such as particle
conservation, and includes both initial correlations and initial embedding
effects, without restrictions on the time-dependence of the external driving
field. We present results for the time-dependent density, current and dipole
moment for a correlated tight binding chain connected to one-dimensional
non-interacting leads exposed to DC and AC biases of various forms. We find
that the self-consistent 2B and GW approximations are in extremely good
agreement with each other at all times, for the long-range interactions that we
consider. In the DC case we show that the oscillations in the transients can be
understood from interchain and lead-chain transitions in the system and find
that the dominant frequency corresponds to the HOMO-LUMO transition of the
central wire. For AC biases with odd inversion symmetry odd harmonics to high
harmonic order in the driving frequency are observed in the dipole moment,
whereas for asymmetric applied bias also even harmonics have considerable
intensity. In both cases we find that the HOMO-LUMO transition strongly mixes
with the harmonics leading to harmonic peaks with enhanced intensity at the
HOMO-LUMO transition energy.

We calculated grids of synthetic energy distributions (SEDs) based on NLTE
model atmospheres for the analysis of the hottest white dwarfs and present the
result of fits to Chandra and XMM-Newton grating X-ray spectra of V4743 Sgr of
outstanding quality, exhibiting prominent resonance lines of C V, C VI, N VI, N
VII, and O VII in absorption. The nova reached its highest effective
temperature (Teff = 740 +/- 70kK) around April 2003 and remained at that
temperature at least until September 2003. We conclude that the white dwarf is
massive, about 1.1 - 1.2 Msun. The nuclear-burning phase lasted for 2 to 2.5
years after the outburst, probably the average duration for a classical nova.
The photosphere of V4743 Sgr was strongly carbon deficient (about times solar)
and enriched in nitrogen and oxygen (> 5 times solar). Especially the very low
C/N ratio indicates that the material at the white dwarf's surface underwent
thermonuclear burning. Thus, this nova retained some of the accreted material
and did not eject all of it in outburst. From March to September 2003, the
nitrogen abundance is strongly decreasing, probably new material is already
been accreted at this stage.

Various - not fully convincing - explanations for these oscillations have been
proposed, including stochastic influences, depensatory fishing, or genetic
effects. Here, we show that the oscillations can be explained as a stable
dynamical attractor of the population dynamics, resulting from a strong
resonance near a Neimark Sacker bifurcation. This explains not only the
long-term persistence of these oscillations, but also reproduces correctly the
empirical sequence of salmon abundance within one period of the oscillations.
Furthermore, it explains the observation that these oscillations occur only in
sockeye stocks originating from large oligotrophic lakes, and that they are
usually not observed in salmon species that have a longer generation time.

several decades. Recently, theoretical models and experimental evidence show
that costly punishment may facilitate cooperation in human societies, but may
not be used by winners. The puzzle how the costly punishment behaviour evolves
can be solved under voluntary participation. Could the punishers emerge if
participation is compulsory? Is the punishment inevitably a selfish behaviour
or an altruistic behaviour? The motivations behind punishment are still an
enigma. Based on public goods interactions, we present a model in which just a
certain portion of the public good is divided equally among all members. The
other portion is distributed to contributors when paying a second cost.
Contributors who are willing to pay a second cost can be costly (and then
altruistic) punishers, but they can also flourish or dominate the population,
in this case we may call them ""advantageous punishers"". We argue that most of
successful cooperators and punishers in nature are advantageous punishers, and
costly punishment mostly happens in humans. This indicates a universal
surviving rule: contributing more and gaining more. Our models show
theoretically that the original motivation behind punishment is to retrieve
deserved payoff from their own contributions, a selfish incentive.

used to mold a wavefront of Gaussian beam into a helical one. Second, 3D FDTD
simulations are performed to confirm the spiraling evolutions of the resultant
field and phase, clearly demonstrating OAM generated. Further theoretical
analyses show that the refractive index exhibiting a helical distribution leads
to the oppositely spiral phase front and that it is feasible to produce
desirable OAM by generators of unit OAM. The results not only provide an
additional way to manipulate phase and photon OAM, but reciprocally shed
further light on the phase structure of helical beams, which leads to a new
transformation way by a surface.

inclination for the efficiency of a typical coronagraphic or occulter-based
mission. The relative impact and complementarity with prior knowledge of
exozodiacal brightness down to achievable levels is examined and discussed. It
is found that inclination has an even greater impact than the exozodiacal

different methods for inclination determination, and their respective

outburst the spectrum is hard, with a PL photon index about 2 (or kT about 1.4
keV) which steepens to about 4 (or kT about 0.8 keV) within one day from the
BAT trigger, though the two components are likely present simultaneously during
the first day spectra. An INTEGRAL observation carried out five days after the
trigger provided an upper limit of about 2E-11 erg/cm^2/s to the emission of 1E
1547.0-5408 in the 18-60 keV band.

detected and resolved the densest cores near the BN/KL region. At a wavelength
of ~870 micron, the polarized dust emission can be used to trace the structure
of the magnetic field in this star-forming core. The dust continuum appears to
arise from a V-shaped region, with a cavity nearly coincident with the center
of the explosive outflows observed on larger scales. The position angles
(P.A.s) of the observed polarization vary significantly by a total of about 90
degree but smoothly, i.e., curl-like, across the dust ridges. Such a
polarization pattern can be explained with dust grains being magnetically
aligned instead of mechanically with outflows, since the latter mechanism would
cause the P.A.s to be parallel to the direction of the outflow, i.e.,
radial-like. The magnetic field projected in the plane of sky is therefore
derived by rotating the P.A.s of the polarization by 90 degree. We find an
azimuthally symmetric structure in the overall magnetic field morphology, with
the field directions pointing toward 2.5"" west to the center of the explosive
outflows. We also find a preferred symmetry plane at a P.A. of 36 degree, which
is perpendicular to the mean magnetic field direction (120 degree) of the 0.5

populations is adequately described by conventional replicator dynamics, and
these equations are known to have internal fixed points. Internal absorption in
finite populations on the other hand is a novel dynamic phenomenon. Due to an
outward drift in finite populations this type of dynamic arrest is not found in
other commonly studied microscopic dynamics, not even in those with the same
deterministic replicator limit as imitation.

are the generalizations of the Archimedean and Catalan solids respectively.
This work is an extension of two previous papers of ours which were based on
the Archimedean and Catalan solids obtained as the orbits of the Coxeter groups
. When these groups act on an arbitrary vector in 3D Euclidean space they
generate the orbits corresponding to the quasi regular polyhedra. Special
choices of the vectors lead to the platonic and Archimedean solids. In general,
the faces of the quasi regular polyhedra consist of the equilateral triangles,
squares, regular pentagons as well as rectangles, isogonal hexagons, isogonal
octagons, and isogonal decagons depending on the choice of the Coxeter groups
of interest. We follow the quaternionic representation of the group elements of
the Coxeter groups which necessarily leads to the quaternionic representation
of the vertices. We note the fact that the molecule can best be represented by
a truncated icosahedron where the hexagonal faces are not regular, rather, they
are isogonal hexagons where single bonds and double bonds of the carbon atoms
are represented by the alternating edge lengths of isogonal hexagons.

bispectrum is dominated by two primordial magnetic shapes. The first magnetic
shape looks similar to the one from local-type primordial curvature
perturbations, so both the amplitude and profile of the Komatsu-Spergel
estimator (reduced bispectrum) seeded by this shape are almost the same as
those of the primary CMB anisotropies. However, for different parameter sets
($l_1,l_2$), this ""local-type"" reduced bispectrum oscillates around different
asymptotic values in the high-$l_3$ regime because of the effect of the Lorentz
force, which is exerted by the primordial magnetic fields on the charged
baryons. This feature is different from the standard case where all modes
approach to zero asymptotically in the high-$l$ limit. On the other hand, the
second magnetic shape appears only in the primordial magnetic field model. The
amplitude of the Komatsu-Spergel estimator sourced by the second shape diverges
in the low-$l$ regime because of the negative slope of shape. In the high-$l$
regime, this amplitude is approximately equal to that of the first estimator,
but with a reversal phase.

periods at subphotospheric level, from short periods, introduced for academic
purposes, to longer and realistic periods of three and five minutes. We present
a detailed description of the three-dimensional mode transformation in a
non-trivial sunspot-like magnetic field configuration, including the conversion
between fast and slow magneto-acoustic waves and the Alfv\'en wave, by
calculation of the wave energy fluxes. Our main findings are the following: (1)
the conversion from acoustic to the Alfv\'en mode is only observed if the the
driving pulse is located out of the sunspot axis, but this conversion is
energetically inefficient; (2) as a consequence of the cut-off effects and
refraction of the fast magneto-acoustic mode, the energy of the evanescent
waves with periods around 5 minutes remains almost completely below the level
beta=1; (3) waves with frequencies above the cut-off propagate field-aligned to
the chromosphere and their power becomes dominating over that of evanescent
5-minute oscillations, in agreement with observations.

uniformly distributed over a given interval. From an initial sequence of
distributions $(\pi_t)$ of interest, and a particular choice of $\xi(\theta)$,
a free energy SMC sampler computes sequentially a sequence of biased

marginal distribution of $\xi(\theta)$ with respect to $\tilde{\pi}_{t}$ is
approximatively uniform over a specified interval, and (b) $\tilde{\pi}_{t}$

apply our methodology to mixture posterior distributions, which are highly
multimodal. In the mixture context, forcing certain hyper-parameters to higher

symetric output. We illustrate our approach with univariate and bivariate

main result of the paper is a characterization of lattice pseudo-effect
algebras in terms of so-called pseudo Sasaki algebras. We also show that all
pseudo-effect algebras can be characterized in terms of certain partially
defined double residuated structures.

  arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1012.0013",,,,"hep-th gr-qc math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Massive quantum matter of prescribed spin permits infinitely many
possibilities of covariantization in terms of spinorial (undotted/dotted)
pointlike fields, whereas massless finite helicity representations lead to
large gap in this spinorial spectrum which for s=1 excludes vectorpotentials.
Since the nonexistence of such pointlike generators is the result of a deep
structural clash between modular localization and the Hilbert space setting of
QT, there are two ways out: gauge theory which sacrifies the Hilbert space and
keeps the pointlike formalism and the use of stringlike potentials which allows
to preserve the Hilbert space. The latter setting contains also
string-localized charge-carrying operators whereas the gauge theoretic
formulation is limited to point-like generated observables. This description
also gives a much better insight into the Higgs mechanism which leads to a
revival of the more physical ""Schwinger-Higgs"" screening idea. The new
formalism is not limited to m=0, s=1, it leads to renormalizable interactions
in the sense of power-counting for all s in massless representations. The
existence of stringlike vectorpotentials is preempted by the Aharonov-Bohm
effect in QFT; it is well-known that the use of pointlike vectorpotentials in
Stokes theorem would with lead to wrong results. Their use in Maxwell's
equations is known to lead to zero Maxwell charge. The role of
string-localization in the problem behind the observed invisibility and
confinement of gluons and quarks leads to new questions and problems. PACS:

of the electron EDM using the solid GdIG. There, it is argued that a sample
electric polarization appears when the sample is magnetized; the common belief
is that the electron EDM must be collinear with its magnetic moment. All this
is objected and it is suggested that the polarization of the sample can be
explained by the direct, Lorentz covariant, interaction between B^{a} and an
EDM d^{a}.
