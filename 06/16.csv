general search strategy that branches on the forbidden subgraphs of a graph
class relaxation. By using the class of $P_4$-sparse graphs as the relaxed
graph class, we obtain efficient bounded search tree algorithms for several
parameterized deletion problems. We give the first non-trivial bounded search
tree algorithms for the cograph edge-deletion problem and the trivially perfect

  (TPLP)",,,"INFSYS RR-1843-09-05","cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Different notions of equivalence, such as the prominent notions of strong and
uniform equivalence, have been studied in Answer-Set Programming, mainly for
the purpose of identifying programs that can serve as substitutes without
altering the semantics, for instance in program optimization. Such semantic
comparisons are usually characterized by various selections of models in the
logic of Here-and-There (HT). For uniform equivalence however, correct
characterizations in terms of HT-models can only be obtained for finite
theories, respectively programs. In this article, we show that a selection of
countermodels in HT captures uniform equivalence also for infinite theories.
This result is turned into coherent characterizations of the different notions
of equivalence by countermodels, as well as by a mixture of HT-models and
countermodels (so-called equivalence interpretations). Moreover, we generalize
the so-called notion of relativized hyperequivalence for programs to
propositional theories, and apply the same methodology in order to obtain a
semantic characterization which is amenable to infinite settings. This allows
for a lifting of the results to first-order theories under a very general
semantics given in terms of a quantified version of HT. We thus obtain a
general framework for the study of various notions of equivalence for theories
under answer-set semantics. Moreover, we prove an expedient property that
allows for a simplified treatment of extended signatures, and provide further
results for non-ground logic programs. In particular, uniform equivalence
coincides under open and ordinary answer-set semantics, and for finite
non-ground programs under these semantics, also the usual characterization of
uniform equivalence in terms of maximal and total HT-models of the grounding is
correct, even for infinite domains, when corresponding ground programs are
infinite.

transit timing has been recognized as a powerful method to discover and
characterize additional planets in these systems. However, the gravitational
influence of additional planets is not the only expected source of transit
timing variations. In this work, we derive the expected detection frequency of
stellar companions of hot-jupiter transiting planets host-stars, detectable by
means of transit timing analysis. Since roughly half of the stars in the solar
neighborhood belong to binary or multiple stellar systems, the same fraction of
binary systems may be expected to be present among transiting planet-host
stars, unless planet formation is significantly influenced by the presence of a
stellar companion. Transit searches are less affected by the selection biases
against long-period binaries that plague radial velocity surveys. If the
frequency of binaries among hot-jupiter planets host stars is the same as
determined in the solar neighborhood, after 5 years since the discovery of a
sample of transiting planets 1.0%+/-0.2% of them have a probability >99% to
present transit timing variations >50 sec induced by stellar binarity, and
2.8%+/-0.3% after 10 years, if the planetary and binary orbits are coplanar.
Considering the case of random inclinations the probabilities are 0.6%+/-0.1%
and 1.7%+/-0.2% after 5 and 10 years respectively. Our estimates can be
considered conservative lower limits, since we have taken into account only
binaries with periods P>5x10^3 days (a>=6 AU). Our simulations indicate that
transit timing variations due to the light travel time effect allow discovery
of stellar companions up to maximum separations equal to a\sim36 AU after 5
years since the discovery of the planet (a\sim75 AU after 10 years).

$\alpha$-intersecting and define, for example, a threshold $\mu_i(k,\alpha)$
for the number of clause intersection pairs $i$, such that every
$\alpha$-intersecting k-CNF formula in which at most $\mu_i(k,\alpha)$ pairs of
clauses share a variable is satisfiable and there exists an unsatisfiable
$\alpha$-intersecting k-CNF formula with $\mu_m(k,\alpha)$ such intersections.
We provide a lower bound for these thresholds based on the Lovasz Local Lemma
and a nearly matching upper bound by constructing an unsatisfiable k-CNF to
show that $\mu_i(k,\alpha) = \tilde{\Theta}(2^{k(2+1/\alpha)})$. Similar
thresholds are determined for the number of variables ($\mu_n =
\tilde{\Theta}(2^{k/\alpha})$) and the number of clauses ($\mu_m =

family of unsatisfiable formula that achieve all four thresholds

successfully been used in the machine learning community. The primary
mathematical tool employed in these methods is the notion of the Reproducing
Kernel Hilbert Space. However, so far, the emphasis has been on batch
techniques. It is only recently, that online techniques have been considered in
the context of adaptive signal processing tasks. Moreover, these efforts have
only been focussed on real valued data sequences. To the best of our knowledge,
no adaptive kernel-based strategy has been developed, so far, for complex
valued signals. Furthermore, although the real reproducing kernels are used in
an increasing number of machine learning problems, complex kernels have not,
yet, been used, in spite of their potential interest in applications that deal
with complex signals, with Communications being a typical example. In this
paper, we present a general framework to attack the problem of adaptive
filtering of complex signals, using either real reproducing kernels, taking
advantage of a technique called \textit{complexification} of real RKHSs, or
complex reproducing kernels, highlighting the use of the complex gaussian
kernel. In order to derive gradients of operators that need to be defined on
the associated complex RKHSs, we employ the powerful tool of Wirtinger's
Calculus, which has recently attracted attention in the signal processing
community. To this end, in this paper, the notion of Wirtinger's calculus is
extended, for the first time, to include complex RKHSs and use it to derive
several realizations of the Complex Kernel Least-Mean-Square (CKLMS) algorithm.
Experiments verify that the CKLMS offers significant performance improvements
over several linear and nonlinear algorithms, when dealing with nonlinearities.

collisions at RHIC might look puzzling, since the nuclear suppression seems to
fade at large pT. We explain this by the interplay of three mechanisms: (i)
attenuation of J/Psi in the hot medium created in the nuclear collision; (ii)
initial state shadowing of charmed quarks and attenuation of a c-cbar dipole
propagating through the colliding nuclei; (iii) a strong Cronin effect for
J/Psi caused by saturation of gluons in the colliding nuclei. All three effects
are well under control and calculated in a parameter free way, except for the
transport coefficient q_0-hat characterizing the medium. This is adjusted to
the J/Psi data and found to be in good agreement with the pQCD prediction, but
more than an order of magnitude smaller than what was extracted from jet
quenching data within the energy loss scenario.

Standard Model (SM) which offers interesting phenomenology. In the minimal UED

states can only be pair produced at colliders and the lightest KK particle is
stable. In most of the parameter space, first KK excitation of SM hypercharge
gauge boson is the lightest one and it can be a viable dark matter candidate.
Thus, the decay of $n=1$ KK particles will always involve missing transverse
energy as well as leptons and jets. The production cross sections of $n=1$ KK
particles are large and such particles may be observed at the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC). We explore the mUED discovery potential of the LHC with
$\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV in the multileptonic final states. Since in the early LHC
run, precise determination of missing transverse energy may not be possible, we
examine the LHC reach with and without using missing transverse energy
information. We observe that missing transverse energy cut will not improve
mUED discovery reach significantly. We have found that opposite sign di-lepton
channel is the most promising discovery mode and with first $fb^{-1}$ of
collected luminosity, LHC will be able to discover the strongly interacting
$n=1$ KK particles with masses upto 800 to 900 GeV.

monochromatic lightcurve from the CoRoT initial run dataset (exoplanet field).
Eleven consecutive 1.26m deep total primary and the equal number of 0.25m deep
secondary eclipses (at phase 0.50) were observed. The following light elements
for the primary eclipse were derived: HJD_MinI= 2454139.0680 + 5.0548d x E. The
lightcurve modeling leads to a semidetached configuration with the photometric
mass ratio q=0.2 and orbital inclination i=85 deg. The out-of-eclipse
lightcurve shows ellipsoidal variability and positive O'Connell effect as well
as clear 0.01m pulsations with the dominating frequency of 2.75 c/d. The
pulsations disappear during the primary eclipses, which indicates the primary
(more massive) component to be the pulsating star. Careful frequency analysis
reveals the second independent pulsation frequency of 0.21 c/d and numerous
combinations of these frequencies with the binary orbital frequency and its
harmonics. On the basis of the CoRoT lightcurve and ground based multicolor
photometry, we favor classification of the pulsating component as a gamma

from superfluidity along grain boundaries in a two-dimensional bosonic system.
We make use of a standard mapping between the zero-temperature properties of
this system and the statistical mechanics of interacting vortex lines in the
mixed phase of a type-II superconductor. In the mapping, the liquid phase of
the vortex system corresponds to the superfluid bosonic phase. We consider
numerically obtained polycrystalline configurations of the vortex lines in
which the microcrystals are separated by liquid-like grain boundary regions
which widen as the vortex system temperature increases. The NCRI of the
corresponding zero-temperature bosonic systems can then be numerically
evaluated by solving the equations of superfluid hydrodynamics in the channels
near the grain boundaries. We find that the NCRI increases very abruptly as the
liquid regions in the vortex system (equivalently, superfluid regions in the
bosonic system) form a connected, system-spannig structure with one or more
closed loops. The implications of these results for experimentally observed
supersolid phenomena are discussed.

Comptonization, Y_SZ, is derived from the SZ measurements, using additional
information from the X-ray measured gas density profiles and a universal
temperature profile. We calculate scaling relations between the X-ray and SZ

the expectations from simple self-similar behavior. Specifically, we fit a
Y_SZ-Y_X relation and find a normalization of 0.82 +- 0.07, marginally
consistent with the predicted ratio of Y_SZ/Y_X=0.91+-0.01 that would be
expected from the density and temperature models used in this work. Using the
Y_X derived mass estimates, we fit a Y_SZ-M_500 relation and find a slope
consistent with the self-similar expectation of Y_SZ ~ M^5/3 with a

the X-ray mass estimates to previously published SZ mass estimates derived from

stellar populations, but may host chemically distinct sub-populations,
typically with an enhanced helium abundance. These helium-rich populations can
make up a substantial fraction of all cluster stars.
  One of the proposed formation channels for blue straggler stars is the
physical collision and merger of two stars. In the context of multiple
populations, collisions between stars with different helium abundances should
occur and contribute to the observed blue straggler population. This will
affect the predicted blue straggler colour and luminosity function.
  We quantify this effect by calculating models of mergers resulting from
collisions between stars with different helium abundances and using these
models to model a merger population. We then compare these results to four
observed clusters, NGC 1851, NGC 2808, NGC 5634 and NGC 6093.
  As in previous studies our models deviate from the observations, particularly
in the colour distributions. However, our results are consistent with
observations of multiple populations in these clusters. In NGC 2808, our best
fitting models include normal and helium enhanced populations, in agreement
with helium enhancement inferred in this cluster. The other three clusters show
better agreement with models that do not include helium enhancement. We discuss

structure than their four dimensional counterparts. They appear in a variety of
configurations (e.g. black holes, black branes, black rings, black Saturns),
and display complex stability phase diagrams. They might also play a key role
in high energy physics: for energies above the fundamental Planck scale,
gravity is the dominant interaction which, together with the hoop-conjecture,
implies that the trans-Planckian scattering of point particles should be well
described by black hole scattering. Higher dimensional scenarios with a
fundamental Planck scale of the order of TeV predict, therefore, black hole
production at the LHC, as well as in future colliders with yet higher energies.
In this setting, accurate predictions for the production cross-section and
energy loss (through gravitational radiation) in the formation of black holes
in parton-parton collisions is crucial for accurate phenomenological modelling
in Monte Carlo event generators.
  In this paper, we use the formalism and numerical code reported in
arXiv:1001.2302 to study the head-on collision of two black holes. For this
purpose we provide a detailed treatment of gravitational wave extraction in
generic D-dimensional space-times, which uses the Kodama-Ishibashi formalism.
For the first time, we present the results of numerical simulations of the
head-on collision in five space-time dimensions, together with the relevant
physical quantities. We show that the total radiated energy, when two black
holes collide from rest at infinity, is approximately (0.089\pm 0.006)% of the
centre of mass energy, slightly larger than the 0.055% obtained in the four
dimensional case, and that the ringdown signal at late time is in very good

of each neutrino flavour coming from such distant sources and their distortion
relative to each other may serve as pointers to exotic physics such as neutrino
decay, Lorentz symmetry violation, pseudo-Dirac effects, CP and CPT violation
and quantum decoherence. This allows us to probe hitherto unexplored ranges of
parameters for the above cases, for example lifetimes in the range $
10^{-3}-10^{4} $ s/eV for the case of neutrino decay. We show that standard
neutrino oscillations ensure that the different flavours arrive at the earth
with similar shapes even if their flavour spectra at source may differ strongly
in both shape and magnitude. As a result, observed differences between the
spectra of various flavours at the detector would be signatures of non-standard
physics altering neutrino fluxes during propagation rather than those arising
during their production at source. Since detection of ultra-high energy (UHE)
neutrinos is perhaps imminent, it is possible that such differences in spectral
shapes will be tested in neutrino detectors in the near future. To that end,
using the IceCube detector as an example, we show how our results translate to
observable shower and muon-track event rates.

using the appropriate topological invariant for this case. This is in striking
contrast to the analogous condition for the time-reversal invariant topological

results of [PST03] to a more general class of magnetic fields: we consider a
single particle moving in a periodic potential which is subjectd to a weak and
slowly-varying electromagnetic field. In addition to the semiclassical
parameter $\eps \ll 1$ which quantifies the separation of spatial scales, we
explore the influence of additional parameters that allow us to selectively
switch off the magnetic field.
  We find that even in the case of magnetic fields with components in
$C_b^{\infty}(\R^d)$, e. g. for constant magnetic fields, the results of
Panati, Spohn and Teufel hold, i.e. to each isolated family of Bloch bands,
there exists an associated almost invariant subspace of $L^2(\R^d)$ and an
effective hamiltonian which generates the dynamics within this almost invariant
subspace. In case of an isolated non-degenerate Bloch band, the full quantum
dynamics can be approximated by the hamiltonian flow associated to the
semiclassical equations of motion found in [PST03].

2008 respectively. The observed characteristics of our spectra indicate that UX
UMa has been in different states during those observations. The blue spectra
are very complex. They are dominated by strong and broad single-peaked emission
lines of hydrogen. The high-excitation lines of HeII 4686 and the Bowen blend
are quite strong as well. All the lines consist of a mixture of absorption and
emission components. Using Doppler tomography we have identified four distinct
components of the system: the accretion disc, the secondary star, the bright
spot from the gas stream/disc impact region, and the unique compact area of
absorption in the accretion disc seen as a dark spot in the lower-left quadrant
of the tomograms. In the red wavelength range, both the hydrogen (H_alpha) and
neutral helium (HeI 6678 and HeI 7065) lines were observed in emission and both
exhibited double-peaked profiles. Doppler tomography of these lines reveals
spiral structure in the accretion disc, but in contrast to the blue wavelength
range, there is no evidence for either the dark spot or the gas stream/disc
impact region emission, while the emission from the secondary star is weak.
During the observations in 1999, UX UMa showed many of the defining properties
of the SW Sex stars. However, all these features almost completely disappeared
in 2008. We have also estimated the radial velocity semi-amplitudes K_1 and K_2

model equipped with a mechanism that the RXS signal is brought about by the

obtained spectra exhibit two contributions around the electric dipole (E1) and
quadrupole (E2) positions, and differ drastically when the orientation of H is
reversed. The difference is brought about by the cross terms between the
even-rank AFQ and magnetic-induced odd-rank contributions. At the E1 region,
the relevant cross term is the one within the E1 process, while at the E2
region, they are ones within the E2 process and between the E1 and E2
processes. These findings capture the characteristic features the recent
experimental data show, and provide a strong support and information of the
field-induced multipole orderings. We also evaluate the RXS spectra near the

intensity around the E1 transition, which is as large as that at the L_{3}

corrects the 2-torsion which was not quite correct in the original version.)
The new construction is based on the theory of modules and derivations over a

paper is that the universal derivation of a lambda-ring is given by the
universal derivation of the underlying ring together with an additional
structure depending on the lambda-ring structure in question. In the case of
the ring of big Witt vectors, this additional structure gives rise to divided
Frobenius operators on the module of K\""ahler differentials. It is the
existence of these divided Frobenius operators that makes the new construction
of the big de Rham-Witt complex possible. It is further shown that the big de

big de Rham-Witt complex of the ring of integers is explicitly evaluated. The

component A is confirmed as the core of the radio structure with relatively
high brightness temperature and hard spectrum between 15 and 43 GHz in
comparison with the central component B of dominant flux. The relatively high
degree of polarization for the component A may arise from its complex radio
structure, which is resolvable at 86 GHz. As a contrast, the component B shows
a well fitted power-law spectrum with the spectral index of about -0.5, and a
linear correlation between EVPAs and wavelength square with the observed RM of
about -1062 rad m^{-2}, indicating its structural singleness. Assuming that the
component B has a comparable degree of polarization without depolarization at
these frequencies, the decrease in fractional polarization with wavelength
mainly results from opacity and Faraday rotation, in which the opacity plays
quite a large part of role. A spine-sheath like structure in fractional
polarization is detected covering almost the whole emission region at 5 and 8
GHz. The linear polarization at 5 GHz shows 3 separate polarized emission
regions with alternately aligned and orthogonal polarization vectors down the
jet. The polarization goes to zero between the top two regions, with the
highest polarization level occurring at the top and bottom. The 5 and 8 GHz
images show EVPA changes across the width of the jet as well as along the jet.
These complex polarimetric properties can be explained in terms of either the
presence of a large helical magnetic field or tangled magnetic fields
compressed and sheared down the jet.

dynamics of a non-conserved order parameter. The second one is the strongly
non-equilibrium reaction-diffusion system, known as Gribov process and
equivalent to the Reggeon field theory. The turbulent mixing is modelled by the
Kazantsev-Kraichnan ""rapid-change"" ensemble: time-decorrelated Gaussian
velocity field with the power-like spectrum k^{-d-\xi}. Effects of
compressibility of the fluid are studied. It is shown that, depending on the
relation between the exponent \xi and the spatial dimension d, the both systems
exhibit four different types of critical behaviour, associated with four
possible fixed points of the renormalization group equations. The most
interesting point corresponds to a new type of critical behaviour, in which the
nonlinearity and turbulent mixing are both relevant, and the critical exponents
depend on d, \xi and the degree of compressibility. For the both models,
compressibility enhances the role of the nonlinear terms in the dynamical
equations: the region in the d-\xi plane, where the new nontrivial regime is
stable, is getting much wider as the degree of compressibility increases. In
its turn, turbulent transfer becomes more efficient due to combined effects of
the mixing and the nonlinear terms.

an associated supernova (SN) has challenged the current classification and fuel
model for long GRBs, and thus a tidal disruption model has been proposed to
account for such an event. Since it is difficult to detect SNe for long GRBs at
high redshift, the absence of an SN association cannot be regarded as the solid
criterion for a new classification of long GRBs similar to GRB 060614, called
GRB 060614-type bursts. Fortunately, we now know that there is an obvious
periodic substructure observed in the prompt light curve of GRB 060614. We thus
use such periodic substructure as a potential criterion to categorize some long
GRBs into a new class of bursts, which might have been fueled by an
intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) gulping a star, rather than a massive star
collapsing to form a black hole. Therefore, the second criterion to recognize
for this new class of bursts is whether they fit the tidal disruption model.
From a total of 328 Swift GRBs with accurately measured durations and without
SN association, we find 25 GRBs satisfying the criteria for GRB 060614-type
bursts: seven of them are with known redshifts and 18 with unknown redshifts.
These new bursts are ~6% of the total Swift GRBs, which are clustered into two
subclasses: Type I and Type II with considerably different viscous parameters
of accretion disks formed by tidally disrupting their different progenitor
stars. We suggest that the two different kinds of progenitors are solar-type
stars and white dwarfs: the progenitors for four Type I bursts with viscous
parameter of around 0.1 are solar-type stars, and the progenitors for 21 Type
II bursts with viscous parameter of around 0.3 are white dwarfs. The potential
applications of this new class of GRBs as cosmic standard candles are discussed

important in, for example, ranking websites, publications, and sports teams,
and for understanding signal flows in systems biology. A prevailing centrality
measure in this respect is the PageRank. In this work, we focus on another
class of centrality derived from the Laplacian of the network. We extend the
Laplacian-based centrality, which has mainly been applied to strongly connected
networks, to the case of general directed networks such that we can
quantitatively compare arbitrary nodes. Toward this end, we adopt the idea used
in the PageRank to introduce global connectivity between all the pairs of nodes
with a certain strength. Numerical simulations are carried out on some
networks. We also offer interpretations of the Laplacian-based centrality for
general directed networks in terms of various dynamical and structural
properties of networks. Importantly, the Laplacian-based centrality defined as
the stationary density of the continuous-time random walk with random jumps is
shown to be equivalent to the absorption probability of the random walk with
sinks at each node but without random jumps. Similarly, the proposed centrality
represents the importance of nodes in dynamics on the original network supplied
with sinks but not with random jumps.

viable alternatives to conventional ion beam sources due to their unique

delivery. Typically the acceleration is due to the rapid expansion of a laser
heated solid foil, but this usually leads to ion beams with large energy
spread. Until now, control of the energy spread has only been achieved at the
expense of reduced charge and increased complexity. Radiation pressure
acceleration (RPA) provides an alternative route to producing laser-driven
monoenergetic ion beams. In this paper, we show the interaction of an intense
infrared laser with a gaseous hydrogen target can produce proton spectra of
small energy spread (~ 4%), and low background. The scaling of proton energy
with the ratio of intensity over density (I/n) indicates that the acceleration
is due to the shock generated by radiation-pressure driven hole-boring of the
critical surface. These are the first high contrast mononenergetic beams that
have been theorised from RPA, and makes them highly desirable for numerous ion
beam applications.

diversification and enrichment of mammalian transcriptomes through various
mechanisms such as exonization and intronization (the birth of new
exons/introns from previously intronic/exonic sequences, respectively), and
insertion into first and last exons. However, no extensive analysis has
compared the effects of TEs on the transcriptomes of mammalian, non-mammalian
vertebrates and invertebrates. Results: We analyzed the influence of TEs on the
transcriptomes of five species, three invertebrates and two non-mammalian
vertebrates. Compared to previously analyzed mammals, there were lower levels
of TE introduction into introns, significantly lower numbers of exonizations
originating from TEs and a lower percentage of TE insertion within the first
and last exons. Although the transcriptomes of vertebrates exhibit a
significant level of exonizations of TEs, only anecdotal cases were found in
invertebrates. In vertebrates, as in mammals, the exonized TEs are mostly
alternatively spliced, indicating selective pressure maintains the original
mRNA product generated from such genes. Conclusions: Exonization of TEs is
wide-spread in mammals, less so in non- mammalian vertebrates, and very low in
invertebrates. We assume that the exonization process depends on the length of
introns. Vertebrates, unlike invertebrates, are characterized by long introns
and short internal exons. Our results suggest that there is a direct link
between the length of introns and exonization of TEs and that this process
became more prevalent following the appearance of mammals.

evolutionary constraints that have shaped fixation of transposed elements
within human and mouse protein coding genes and subsequent exonization is
important for understanding of how the exonization process has affected
transcriptome and proteome complexities. Here we show that exonization of
transposed elements is biased towards the beginning of the coding sequence in
both human and mouse genes. Analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
revealed that exonization of transposed elements can be population-specific,
implying that exonizations may enhance divergence and lead to speciation. SNP
density analysis revealed differences between Alu and other transposed
elements. Finally, we identified cases of primate-specific Alu elements that
depend on RNA editing for their exonization. These results shed light on TE
fixation and the exonization process within human and mouse genes.

size, their accretion rate is enhanced due to gravitational focusing (GF). We
have developed a new numerical model to calculate the collisional evolution of
the gravitationally-enhanced growth stage. We validate our approach against
existing N-body and statistical codes. Using the numerical model, we explore
the characteristics of the runaway growth and the oligarchic growth accretion
phases starting from an initial population of single planetesimal radius R_0.
In models where the initial random velocity dispersion (as derived from their
eccentricity) starts out below the escape speed of the planetesimal bodies, the
system experiences runaway growth. We find that during the runaway growth phase
the size distribution remains continuous but evolves into a power-law at the
high mass end, consistent with previous studies. Furthermore, we find that the
largest body accretes from all mass bins; a simple two component approximation
is inapplicable during this stage. However, with growth the runaway body stirs
up the random motions of the planetesimal population from which it is
accreting. Ultimately, this feedback stops the fast growth and the system
passes into oligarchy, where competitor bodies from neighboring zones catch up
in terms of mass. Compared to previous estimates, we find that the system
leaves the runaway growth phase at a somewhat larger radius. Furthermore, we
assess the relevance of small, single-size fragments on the growth process. In
classical models, where the initial velocity dispersion of bodies is small,
these do not play a critical role during the runaway growth; however, in models
that are characterized by large initial relative velocities due to external
stirring of their random motions, a situation can emerge where fragments
dominate the accretion.

different carbon concentrations using ab initio methods. The studied (110),
(100) and (111) facets show qualitatively different behaviour when carbon
concentration changes. In particular, adsorbed carbon atoms repel each other on
the (110) facet, resulting in carbon dimer and graphitic material formation.
Carbon on the (100) facet forms stable structures at concentrations of about
0.5 monolayer and at 1.0 monolayer this facet becomes unstable due to a
frustration of the top layer iron atoms. The stability of the (111) facet is
weakly affected by the amount of adsorbed carbon and its stability increases
further with respect to the (100) facet with increasing carbon concentration.
The exchange of carbon atoms between the surface and sub-surface regions on the
(111) facet is easier than on the other facets and the formation of carbon
dimers is exothermic. These findings are in accordance with a recent in situ
experimental study where the existence of graphene decorated (111) facets is
related to increased carbon concentration.

crystalline Ba(Fe1-xTMx)2As2 (TM = Ni and Cu) series, as well as two mixed TM =
Cu / Co series, are reported. All the transport and thermodynamic measurements
indicate that the structural and magnetic phase transitions at 134 K in pure
BaFe2As2 are monotonically suppressed and increasingly separated in a similar
manner by these dopants. In the Ba(Fe1-xNix)2As2 (x =< 0.072),
superconductivity, with Tc up to 19 K, is stabilized for 0.024 =< x =< 0.072.
In the Ba(Fe1-xCux)2As2 (x =< 0.356) series, although the structural and
magnetic transitions are suppressed, there is only a very limited region of
superconductivity: a sharp drop of the resistivity to zero near 2.1 K is found
only for the x = 0.044 samples. In the Ba(Fe1-x-yCoxCuy)2As2 series,
superconductivity, with Tc values up to 12 K (x ~ 0.022 series) and 20 K (x ~
0.047 series), is stabilized. Quantitative analysis of the detailed
temperature-dopant concentration (T-x) and temperature-extra electrons (T-e)
phase diagrams of these series shows that there exists a limited range of the
number of extra electrons added, inside which the superconductivity can be
stabilized if the structural and magnetic phase transitions are suppressed
enough. Moreover, comparison with pressure-temperature phase diagram data, for
samples spanning the whole doping range, further reenforces the conclusion that
suppression of the structural / magnetic phase transition temperature enhances
Tc on the underdoped side, but for the overdoped side Tcmax is determined by e.
Therefore, by choosing the combination of dopants that are used, we can adjust
the relative positions of the upper phase lines (structural and magnetic phase
transitions) and the superconducting dome to control the occurrence and
disappearance of the superconductivity in transition metal, electron-doped
BaFe2As2.

many cycles of these slowly inspiraling systems. To that end, the use of very
precise theoretical waveform templates in the data analysis is required. To
build them we need to have a deep understanding of the gravitational
backreaction mechanism responsible for the inspiral. The self-force approach
describes the inspiral as the action of a local force that can be obtained from
the regularization of the perturbations created by the stellar compact object
on the massive black hole geometry. In this paper we extend a new time-domain
technique for the computation of the self-force from the circular case to the
case of eccentric orbits around a non-rotating black hole. The main idea behind
our scheme is to use a multidomain framework in which the small compact object,
described as a particle, is located at the interface between two subdomains.
Then, the equations at each subdomain are homogeneous wave-type equations,
without distributional sources. In this particle-without-particle formulation,
the solution of the equations is smooth enough to provide good convergence
properties for the numerical computations. This formulation is implemented by
using a pseudospectral collocation method for the spatial discretization,
combined with a Runge Kutta algorithm for the time evolution. We present
results from several simulations of eccentric orbits in the case of a scalar
charged particle around a Schwarzschild black hole. In particular, we show the
convergence of the method and its ability to resolve the field and its
derivatives across the particle location. Finally, we provide numerical values
of the self-force for different orbital parameters.

study the role of the $z$-directional magnetic field ($h$) in the Kondo effect,

Third, we examine the Friedel oscillation around the magnetic impurity. It
turns out that the pattern of Friedel oscillation in the helical surface is
identical to that of the graphene surface, displaying the inverse-square
behavior $\sim r^{-2}$ if the inter-valley scattering is not introduced in the
graphene case. However, introduction of the magnetic field leads the electron
density of states from the inverse-square physics to the inverse behavior $\sim
r^{-1}$ in the topological insulator's surface while it still remains as $\sim
r^{-2}$ in the graphene Kondo effect. We discuss that this originates from spin
flipping induced by magnetic field.

as an essential element, the emergence of a pseudogap.
  This new energy scale introduces asymmetry in the quasiparticle density of
states because it is associated with the antiferromagnetic Brillouin zone. By
contrast, superconductivity develops on the Fermi surface and this largely
restores the particle-hole symmetry for energies below the superconducting
energy gap scale. In the highly underdoped regime, these two scales can be
separately identified in the density of states and also partial density of
states for each fixed angle in the Brillouin zone. From the total density of
states, we find that the pseudogap energy scale manifests itself differently as
a function of doping for positive and negative bias. Furthermore, we find
evidence from recent scanning tunneling spectroscopy data for asymmetry in the
positive and negative bias of the extracted $\Delta(\theta)$ which is in
qualitative agreement with this model. Likewise, the slope of the linear low
energy density of states is nearly constant in the underdoped regime while it
increases significantly with overdoping in agreement with the data.

formation of high-mass stars (M > 10 Msol) is still poorly understood. Two
types of massive star cluster precursors, the so-called Massive Dense Cores
(MDCs), have been observed, which differ in their mid-infrared brightness. The
origin of this difference is not established and could be the result of
evolution, density, geometry differences, or a combination of these. We compare
several molecular tracers of physical conditions (hot cores, shocks) observed
in a sample of mid-IR weak emitting MDCs with previous results obtained in a
sample of exclusively mid-IR bright MDCs. The aim is to understand the
differences between these two types of object. We present single-dish
observations of HDO, H2O-18, SO2 and CH3OH lines at lambda = 1.3 - 3.5 mm. We
study line profiles and estimate abundances of these molecules, and use a
partial correlation method to search for trends in the results. The detection
rates of thermal emission lines are found to be very similar between mid-IR
quiet and bright objects. The abundances of H2O, HDO (1E-13 to 1E-9 in the cold
outer envelopes), SO2 and CH3OH differ from source to source but independently
of their mid-IR flux. In contrast, the methanol class I maser emission, a
tracer of outflow shocks, is found to be strongly anti-correlated with the 12
micron source brightnesses. The enhancement of the methanol maser emission in
mid-IR quiet MDCs may indicate a more embedded nature. Since total masses are
similar between the two samples, we suggest that the matter distribution is
spherical around mid-IR quiet sources but flattened around mid-IR bright ones.
In contrast, water emission is associated with objects containing a hot
molecular core, irrespective of their mid-IR brightness. These results indicate
that the mid-IR brightness of MDCs is an indicator of their evolutionary stage.

deformation. In particular we look at deformations of germs of isolated
singularities from R_n to R_k (n >= k) and the relation with there natural
stratification in some tame categorie (algebraic, analytic, semi-algebraic,
subanalytic, o-minimal straucture polynomially bounded). The word tame in this
paper will refer to one of these categories.

momentum-squeezed, ultra-cold degenerate fermion gas by circumventing the
effects of Pauli blocking. Although gain from bosonic stimulation is
necessarily absent because the quantum gas obeys Fermi-Dirac statistics,
collective atomic recoil motion from the underlying wave-mixing process is
clearly visible. With a single pump pulse of the proper polarization, we
observe two mutually-perpendicular wave-mixing processes occurring
simultaneously. Our experiments also indicate that the red-blue pump detuning
asymmetry observed with Bose-Einstein condensates does not occur with fermions.

up to 3000 electrons within Kohn-Sham density functional theory, we find that
the ionization potential remains finite and increases across a row, even as
$Z\rightarrow\infty$. The local density approximation becomes chemically
accurate (and possibly exact) in some cases. Extended Thomas-Fermi theory
matches the shell-average of both the ionization potential and density change.
Exact results are given in the limit of weak electron-electron repulsion.

  Cinvestav, Contemporary Mathematics, Amer. Math. Soc., 2014",,,,"math-ph math.AG math.MP math.QA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Abelian Chern-Simons theory relates classical theta functions to the
topological quantum field theory of the linking number of knots. In this paper
we explain how to derive the constructs of abelian Chern-Simons theory directly
from the theory of classical theta functions. It turns out that the theory of
classical theta functions, from the representation theoretic point of view of
A. Weil, is just an instance of Chern-Simons theory. The group algebra of the
finite Heisenberg group is described as an algebra of curves on a surface, and
its Schrodinger representation is obtained as an action on curves in a
handlebody. A careful analysis of the discrete Fourier transform yields the
Reshetikhin-Turaev formula for invariants of 3-dimensional manifolds. In this
context, we give an explanation of why the composition of discrete Fourier
transforms and the non-additivity of the signature of 4-dimensional manifolds
under gluings obey the same formula.

the metallic beta-Sn phase under pressure. We use quantum Monte Carlo
calculations to predict the transformation pressure and compare the results to
density functional calculations employing the LDA, PBE, PW91, WC, AM05, PBEsol
and HSE06 exchange-correlation functionals. Diffusion Monte Carlo predicts a
transition pressure of 14.0 +- 1.0 GPa slightly above the experimentally
observed transition pressure range of 11.3 to 12.6 GPa. The HSE06 hybrid
functional predicts a transition pressure of 12.4 GPa in excellent agreement
with experiments. Exchange-correlation functionals using the local-density
approximation and generalized-gradient approximations result in transition
pressures ranging from 3.5 to 10.0 GPa, well below the experimental values. The
transition pressure is sensitive to stress anisotropy. Anisotropy in the stress
along any of the cubic axes of the diamond phase of silicon lowers the
equilibrium transition pressure and may explain the discrepancy between the
various experimental values as well as the small overestimate of the quantum
Monte Carlo transition pressure.

for an increase of the iron abundance in galaxy clusters with temperature
around 2-4 keV up to a value about 3 times larger than that typical of very hot
clusters. We have started a study of the metal distribution in these objects
from the sample of Baumgartner et al. (2005), aiming at resolving spatially the
metal content of the ICM. We report here on a 42ks XMM observation of the first
object of the sample, the cluster Abell 2028. The XMM observation reveals a
complex structure of the cluster over scale of 300 kpc, showing an interaction
between two sub-clusters in cometary-like configurations. At the leading edges
of the two substructures cold fronts have been detected. The core of the main
subcluster is likely hosting a cool corona. We show that a one-component fit
for this region returns a biased high metallicity. This inverse iron bias is
due to the behavior of the fitting code in shaping the Fe-L complex. In
presence of a multi-temperature structure of the ICM, the best-fit metallicity
is artificially higher when the projected spectrum is modeled with a single
temperature component and it is not related to the presence of both Fe-L and
Fe-K emission lines in the spectrum. After accounting for the bias, the overall
abundance of the cluster is consistent with the one typical of hotter, more
massive clusters. We caution the interpretation of high abundances inferred
when fitting a single thermal component to spectra derived from relatively
large apertures in 3-4 keV clusters, because the inverse iron bias can be
present. Most of the inferences trying to relate high abundances in 3-4 keV
clusters to fundamental physical processes will likely have to be revised.
