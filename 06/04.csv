temperature angular power spectrum due to cosmic (super-)string segments. In
particular, using our method, we clarify the dependence on the intercommuting
probability $P$. We find that the power spectrum is dominated by
Poisson-distributed string segments. The power spectrum for a general value of
$P$ has a plateau on large angular scales and shows a power-law decrease on
small angular scales. The resulting spectrum in the case of conventional cosmic
strings is in very good agreement with the numerical result obtained by Fraisse
et al.. Then we estimate the upper bound on the dimensionless tension of the
string for various values of $P$ by assuming that the fraction of the CMB power
spectrum due to cosmic (super-)strings is less than ten percents at various
angular scales up to $\ell=2000$. We find that the amplitude of the spectrum
increases as the intercommuting probability. As a consequence, strings with
smaller intercommuting probabilities are found to be more tightly constrained.

topological structures, important examples, the notions of a random conjugate

gives several important representation theorems for random conjugate spaces.
Section 4 gives characterizations for a complete random normed module to be

available in random locally convex modules. Section 6 gives the theory of
random duality with respect to the locally $L^{0}-$convex topology and in

Section 8 is devoted to extensions of conditional convex risk measures, which
shows that every representable $L^{\infty}-$type of conditional convex risk

redshift distortion phenomenologically introduced but frequently used in the
literature, the new model includes the corrections arising from the non-linear
coupling between the density and velocity fields associated with two
competitive effects of redshift distortion, i.e., Kaiser and Finger-of-God
effects. Based on the improved treatment of perturbation theory for
gravitational clustering, we compare our model predictions with monopole and
quadrupole power spectra of N-body simulations, and an excellent agreement is
achieved over the scales of BAOs. Potential impacts on constraining dark energy
and modified gravity from the redshift-space power spectrum are also
investigated based on the Fisher-matrix formalism. We find that the existing
phenomenological models of redshift distortion produce a systematic error on
measurements of the angular diameter distance and Hubble parameter by 1~2%, and
the growth rate parameter by ~5%, which would become non-negligible for future
galaxy surveys. Correctly modeling redshift distortion is thus essential, and
the new prescription of redshift-space power spectrum including the non-linear
corrections can be used as an accurate theoretical template for anisotropic
BAOs.

characteristic classes. Such bundles occur if G has a non-trivial center, i.e.
classical simply-connected groups, $E_6$ and $E_7$. We define the conformal

Lax operators, quadratic Hamiltonians, define the phase spaces and the Poisson

generalizes the basis of t'Hooft matrices for sl(N). We find that the MCM

parameters is employed. If other values of the Drude parameters are used, the
Lifshitz formula at zero frequency is experimentally excluded at a 95%

related to systems with long-range interactions that undergo canonical

implies that thermodynamics on R^3 x S^1 can be studied via a unitary matrix

non-perturbatively, we numerically study both zero- and one-dimensional

out to be 1/N. We introduce various twisted versions of the reduced QCD which
systematically suppress finite-N corrections. Using a twisted model, we observe
the confinement/deconfinement transition on a 1^3 x 2-lattice. The result
agrees with large volume simulations of Yang-Mills theory. We also comment that

mechanics, any observer who attempts to perform an experiment in an arbitrarily
small region will be stymied by the formation of a black hole within the
spatial domain of the experiment. This behavior is often invoked in arguments
for a fundamental minimum length. Extending a proof of the hoop conjecture for
spherical symmetry to include higher curvature terms we investigate this
minimum length argument when the gravitational couplings run with energy in the
manner predicted by asymptotically safe gravity. We show that argument for the
mandatory formation of a black hole within the domain of an experiment fails.
Neither is there a proof that a black hole doesn't form. Instead, whether or
not an observer can perform measurements in arbitrarily small regions depends
on the specific numerical values of the couplings near the UV fixed point. We
further argue that when an experiment is localized on a scale much smaller than
the Planck length, at least one enshrouding horizon must form outside the
domain of the experiment. This implies that while an observer may still be able
to perform local experiments, communicating any information out to infinity is
prevented by a large horizon surrounding it, and thus compatibility with
general relativity can still be restored in the infrared limit.

regard, it generalizes the notion of incoherence in the existing literature on
model selection and introduces two fundamental measures of coherence---termed
as the worst-case coherence and the average coherence---among the columns of a
design matrix. It utilizes these two measures of coherence to provide an
in-depth analysis of a simple, model-order agnostic one-step thresholding (OST)
algorithm for model selection and proves that OST is feasible for exact as well
as partial model selection as long as the design matrix obeys an easily
verifiable property. One of the key insights offered by the ensuing analysis in
this regard is that OST can successfully carry out model selection even when
methods based on convex optimization such as the lasso fail due to the rank
deficiency of the submatrices of the design matrix. In addition, the paper
establishes that if the design matrix has reasonably small worst-case and
average coherence then OST performs near-optimally when either (i) the energy
of any nonzero entry of the signal is close to the average signal energy per
nonzero entry or (ii) the signal-to-noise ratio in the measurement system is
not too high. Finally, two other key contributions of the paper are that (i) it
provides bounds on the average coherence of Gaussian matrices and Gabor frames,
and (ii) it extends the results on model selection using OST to low-complexity,
model-order agnostic recovery of sparse signals with arbitrary nonzero entries.

PDF of several flow variables is computed by numerically integrating a system

exact treatment of advection, viscous effects and arbitrarily complex chemical
reactions is possible; these processes are treated without closure assumptions.
A set of algorithms is proposed to provide an efficient solution of the PDF
transport equation modeling the joint PDF of turbulent velocity, frequency and
concentration of a passive scalar in geometrically complex configurations. An
unstructured Eulerian grid is employed to extract Eulerian statistics, to solve
for quantities represented at fixed locations of the domain and to track
particles. All three aspects regarding the grid make use of the finite element
method. Compared to hybrid methods, the current methodology is stand-alone,
therefore it is consistent both numerically and at the level of turbulence
closure without the use of consistency conditions. Several newly developed
algorithms are described that facilitate the numerical solution in complex flow
geometries, including a stabilized mean-pressure projection scheme, the
estimation of conditional and unconditional Eulerian statistics and their
derivatives from stochastic particle fields, particle tracking through
unstructured grids, an efficient particle redistribution procedure and
techniques related to efficient random number generation. The solver has been
parallelized and optimized for shared memory and multi-core architectures using
the OpenMP standard. Relevant aspects of performance and parallelism on
cache-based shared memory machines are discussed and presented in detail. The
methodology shows great promise in the simulation of high-Reynolds-number
incompressible inert or reactive turbulent flows in realistic configurations.

carbon nanotubes with one and two electrostatically confined electrons in the
presence of spin-orbit and Coulomb interactions. Compared to GaAs quantum dots,
the spectrum exhibits a much richer structure because of the spin-orbit
interaction that couples the electron's isospin to its real spin through two
independent coupling constants. In a single dot, both constants combine to
split the spectrum into two Kramers doublets, while the antisymmetric constant
solely controls the difference in the tunneling rates of the Kramers doublets
between the dots. For the two-electron regime, the detailed structure of the
spin-orbit split energy spectrum is investigated as a function of detuning
between the quantum dots in a 22-dimensional Hilbert space within the framework
of a single-longitudinal-mode model. We find a competing effect of the
tunneling and Coulomb interaction. The former favors a left-right symmetric
two-particle ground state, while in the regime where the Coulomb interaction
dominates over tunneling, a left-right antisymmetric ground state is found. As
a result, ground states on both sides of the $(11)$-$(02)$ degeneracy point may
possess opposite left-right symmetry, and the electron dynamics when tuning the
system from one side of the $(11)$-$(02)$ degeneracy point to the other is
controlled by three selection rules (in spin, isospin, and left-right
symmetry). We discuss implications for the spin-dephasing and Pauli blockade
experiments.

technology at telecom wavelength. The impact of the classical channels to the
quantum channel has been investigated for both QKD based on single photon
detection and QKD based on homodyne detection. Our studies show that the latter
can tolerate a much higher level of contamination from the classical channels
than the former. This is because the local oscillator used in the homodyne
detector acts as a ""mode selector"" which can suppress noise photons
effectively. We have performed simulations based on both the decoy BB84 QKD
protocol and the Gaussian modulated coherent state (GMCS) QKD protocol. While
the former cannot tolerate even one classical channel (with a power of 0dBm),
the latter can be multiplexed with 38 classical channels (0dBm power each
channel) and still has a secure distance around 10km. Preliminary experiment
has been conducted based on a 100MHz bandwidth homodyne detector.

embedded in a surrounding distribution of stars. The dynamics of the binary is
evolved by taking into account the erosion of the central stellar cusp bound to
the massive black holes, the scattering of unbound stars feeding the binary
loss cone, and the emission of gravitational waves (GWs). Stellar dynamics is
treated in a hybrid fashion by coupling the results of numerical 3-body
scattering experiments of bound and unbound stars to an analytical framework
for the evolution of the stellar density distribution and for the efficiency of
the binary loss cone refilling. Our main focus is on the behaviour of the
binary eccentricity, in the attempt of addressing its importance in the merger
process and its possible impact for GW detection with the planned Laser
Interferometer Space Antenna ({\it LISA}), and ongoing and forthcoming pulsar
timing array (PTA) campaigns. We produce a family of evolutionary tracks
extensively sampling the relevant parameters of the system which are the binary
mass, mass ratio and initial eccentricity, the slope of the stellar density
distribution, its normalization and the efficiency of loss cone refilling. We
find that, in general, stellar dynamics causes a dramatic increase of the MBHB
eccentricity, especially for initially already mildly eccentric and/or unequal
mass binaries. When applied to standard MBHB population models, our results
predict eccentricities in the ranges $10^{-3}-0.2$ and $0.03-0.3$ for sources
detectable by {\it LISA} and PTA respectively. Such figures may have a

We examine the consequences of these oscillations on the evolution of the cores

helps support the cores and that the dissipation of this energy can lead toward
instability and star formation. In this picture, the core lifetimes are limited
by the pulsation decay timescales, dominated by non-linear mode-mode coupling,
and on the order of ~few x 10^5--10^6 yr. Notably, this is similar to what is
required to explain the relatively low rate of conversion of cores into stars.
For cores with large-amplitude oscillations, dust continuum observations may
appear asymmetric or irregular. As a consequence, some of the cores that would
be classified as supercritical may be dynamically stable when oscillations are
taken into account. Thus, our investigation motivates a simple hydrodynamic
picture, capable of reproducing many of the features of the progenitors of

emission in H-band, but place a 3-sigma limit on the depth of the secondary
eclipse in this band of 0.051%. A secondary eclipse of this depth in Ks
requires very efficient day-to-nightside redistribution of heat and nearly
isotropic reradiation, conclusion that is in agreement with longer wavelength,
mid-infrared Spitzer observations. Our 3-sigma upper-limit on the depth of our
H-band secondary eclipse also argues for very efficient redistribution of heat
and suggests that the atmospheric layer probed by these observations may be
well homogenized. However, our H-band upper limit is so constraining that it
suggests the possibility of a temperature inversion at depth, or an absorbing
molecule, such as methane, that further depresses the emitted flux at this
wavelength. The combination of our near-infrared measurements and those
obtained with Spitzer suggest that TrES-3b displays a near isothermal dayside
atmospheric temperature structure, whose spectrum is well approximated by a
blackbody. We emphasize that our strict H-band limit is in stark disagreement
with the best-fit atmospheric model that results from longer wavelength
observations only, thus highlighting the importance of near-infrared
observations at multiple wavelengths in addition to those returned by Spitzer

theoretical computer science, yet there are hardly any natural problems known
where it provides an asymptotically tight answer. The main theme of our paper
is to identify several of these problems, among them a couple of widely studied
extremal functions related to certain restricted versions of the k-SAT problem,
where the Local Lemma does give essentially optimal answers.
  As our main contribution, we construct unsatisfiable k-CNF formulas where
every clause has k distinct literals and every variable appears in at most (2/e
+ o(1))*2^k/k clauses. The Lopsided Local Lemma shows that this is
asymptotically best possible. The determination of this extremal function is
particularly important as it represents the value where the corresponding k-SAT
problem exhibits a complexity hardness jump: from having every instance being a
YES-instance it becomes NP-hard just by allowing each variable to occur in one
more clause.
  The construction of our unsatisfiable CNF-formulas is based on the binary
tree approach of [16] and thus the constructed formulas are in the class MU(1)
of minimal unsatisfiable formulas having one more clauses than variables. The
main novelty of our approach here comes in setting up an appropriate continuous
approximation of the problem. This leads us to a differential equation, the
solution of which we are able to estimate. The asymptotically optimal binary
trees are then obtained through a discretization of this solution.
  The importance of the binary trees constructed is also underlined by their
appearance in many other scenarios. In particular, they give asymptotically
precise answers for seemingly unrelated problems like the European Tenure Game
introduced by Doerr [9] and a search problem allowing a limited number of
consecutive lies.

an uncharted territory despite the fact that they represent an appreciable

images. Of these, 18 have HST-ACS counterparts while the remaining have no
optical counterparts. The vast majority of our 35 sources are classified as
Extremely Red Objects (EROs) on the basis of their V-K lower limits. Their
photometric redshifts show that these populate moderate redshifts (median
z~2.8), being markedly different from the already spectroscopically identified
population which peaks at z~0.7. The Spitzer-IRAC mid-IR colours of the sources
which have no HST counterparts tend to lie within the mid-IR colour diagram AGN
""wedge"", suggesting either QSO, ULIRG (Mrk231), or early-type galaxy templates
at z>3. A large fraction of our sources (17/35), regardless of whether they
have HST counterparts, can be classified as mid-IR bright/optically faint
sources (Dust Obscured Galaxies) a class which is believed to include many
heavily absorbed AGN. The co-added X-ray spectrum of the optically faint
sources is very flat having a spectral index of Gamma~0.87, significantly
flatter than the spectrum of the X-ray background. The optically faint R>26.5
X-ray sources constitute more than 50% of the total X-ray population at

its evolution; considering X-ray sources with 2<z<4 we find good agreement with

static potential structure surrounding a spacecraft in a high photoelectron
environment. The numerical solutions show that, under certain conditions, a
spacecraft can take on a negative potential in spite of strong photoelectron
currents. The negative potential is due to an electrostatic barrier near the
surface of the spacecraft that can reflect a large fraction of the
photoelectron flux back to the spacecraft. This electrostatic barrier forms if
(1) the photoelectron density at the surface of the spacecraft greatly exceeds
the ambient plasma density, (2) the spacecraft size is significantly larger
than local Debye length of the photoelectrons, and (3) the thermal electron
energy is much larger than the characteristic energy of the escaping
photoelectrons. All of these conditions are present near the Sun. The numerical
solutions also show that the spacecraft's negative potential can be amplified
by an ion wake. The negative potential of the ion wake prevents secondary
electrons from escaping the part of spacecraft in contact with the wake. These
findings may be important for future spacecraft missions that go nearer to the

arising from optimal portfolio liquidation with bid-ask spread and market price
impact penalizing speedy execution trades. The corresponding dynamic
programming (DP) equation is a quasi-variational inequality (QVI) with solvency
constraint satisfied by the value function in the sense of constrained
viscosity solutions. By taking advantage of the lag variable tracking the time
interval between trades, we can provide an explicit backward numerical scheme
for the time discretization of the DPQVI. The convergence of this discrete-time
scheme is shown by viscosity solutions arguments. An optimal quantization
method is used for computing the (conditional) expectations arising in this
scheme. Numerical results are presented by examining the behaviour of optimal
liquidation strategies, and comparative performance analysis with respect to
some benchmark execution strategies. We also illustrate our optimal liquidation
algorithm on real data, and observe various interesting patterns of order

states residing on high-strain regions intrinsic to the activated transport
above the glass transition. Here we demonstrate at the molecular level how this
scenario is realized in an important class of semiconductor glasses, namely
chalcogen and pnictogen containing alloys. Both the glass itself and the
intrinsic electronic midgap states emerge as a result of the formation of a
network composed of $\sigma$-bonded atomic $p$-orbitals that are only weakly
hybridized. Despite a large number of weak bonds, these $pp\sigma$-networks are
stable with respect to competing types of bonding, while exhibiting a high
degree of structural degeneracy. The stability is rationalized with the help of
a hereby proposed structural model, by which $pp\sigma$-networks are
symmetry-broken and distorted versions of a high symmetry structure. The latter
structure exhibits exact octahedral coordination and is fully
covalently-bonded. The present approach provides a microscopic route to a fully
consistent description of the electronic and structural excitations in vitreous

Depending on the payoff parameters, the system can reach an absorbing state of

many of the unique optoelectronic anomalies in these materials. In addition,
these coordination defects are mobile and correspond to the transition state
configurations during the activated transport above the glass transition. The
presence of the coordination defects may account for the puzzling discrepancy
between the kinetic and thermodynamic fragility in chalcogenides. Finally, the
proposed model recovers as limiting cases several popular types of bonding

configurations, and homopolar bonds in heteropolar compounds.

(ESL) exhibits a pseudo-caustic that arises from a branch cut. A pseudo-caustic
is a curve in the source plane across which the number of images changes by
one. The inside lens equation of a bounded ESL is free of a pseudo-caustic.
Thus the total parity of the images of a point source lensed by a bounded
elliptically symmetric mass is not an invariant in violation of the Burke's
theorem. A smooth mass density function does not guarantee the validity of the
Burke's theorem.
  Pseudo-caustics of various lens equations are discussed. In the Appendix,
Bourassa and Kantowski's deflection angle formula for an elliptically symmetric
lens is reproduced using the Schwarz function of the ellipse for an easy
access; the outside and inside lens equations of an arbitrary set of truncated
circularly or elliptically symmetric lenses, represented as points, sticks, and
disks, are presented as a reasonable approximation of the realistic galaxy or
cluster lenses.
  One may consider smooth density functions that are not bounded but fall
sufficiently fast asymptotically to preserve the total parity invariance. Any
bounded function may be sufficiently closely approximated by an unbounded
smooth function obtained by truncating its Fourier integral at a high frequency
mode. Whether to use a bounded function or an unbounded smooth function for an
ESL lens mass density, whereby whether to observe the total parity invariance
or not, incurs philosophical questions. For example, is it sensible to insist
that the elliptical symmetry of an elliptic lens galaxy be valid in the entire
sky? How a pseudo-caustic close to or intersecting with a caustic must be
withered away during a smoothing process and what it means will be investigated
in a separate work.

graph to become infinitesimally flexible, or stressed, and when it has no
impact. A number of other recent papers have studied special classes of
frameworks on generically rigid graphs which are finite mechanisms. Here we
introduce a new tool, the orbit matrix, which connects these two areas and
provides a matrix representation for fully symmetric infinitesimal flexes, and
fully symmetric stresses of symmetric frameworks. The orbit matrix is a true
analog of the standard rigidity matrix for general frameworks, and its analysis
gives important insights into questions about the flexibility and rigidity of
classes of symmetric frameworks, in all dimensions.
  With this narrower focus on fully symmetric infinitesimal motions, comes the
power to predict symmetry-preserving finite mechanisms - giving a simplified
analysis which covers a wide range of the known mechanisms, and generalizes the
classes of known mechanisms. This initial exploration of the properties of the
orbit matrix also opens up a number of new questions and possible extensions of
the previous results, including transfer of symmetry based results from
Euclidean space to spherical, hyperbolic, and some other metrics with shared
symmetry groups and underlying projective geometry.

Previous work has shown that for realistic levels of core magnetization, the
magnetic field suppresses the formation of rotationally supported disks during
the protostellar mass accretion phase of low-mass star formation both in the
ideal MHD limit and in the presence of ambipolar diffusion for typical rates of
cosmic ray ionization. Additional effects, such as ohmic dissipation, the Hall
effect, and protostellar outflow, are needed to weaken the magnetic braking and
enable the formation of persistent, rotationally supported, protostellar disks.
In this paper, we first demonstrate that the classic microscopic resistivity is
not large enough to enable disk formation by itself. We then experiment with a
set of enhanced values for the resistivity in the range
$\eta=10^{17}$--$10^{22}$ cm^2/s. We find that a value of order $10^{19}$
cm^2/s is needed to enable the formation of a 100 AU-scale Keplerian disk; the
value depends somewhat on the degree of core magnetization. The required
resistivity is a few orders of magnitude larger than the classic microscopic
values. Whether it can be achieved naturally during protostellar collapse
remains to be determined.

larger than any other astrophysical object, providing the most effective way,
complementary to ordinary surveys, to study the high redshift universe. To this
end, we present here the results of an observational campaign devoted to the
study of the high-z GRB 090205. We carried out optical/NIR spectroscopy and
imaging of GRB 090205 with the ESO-VLT starting from hours after the event up
to several days later to detect the host galaxy. We compared the results
obtained from our optical/NIR observations with the available Swift high-energy
data of this burst. Our observational campaign led to the detection of the
optical afterglow and host galaxy of GRB 090205 and to the first measure of its
redshift, z=4.65. Similar to other, recent high-z GRBs, GRB 090205 has a short
duration in the rest-frame with T_{90,rf}=1.6 s, which suggests the possibility
that it might belong to the short GRBs class. The X-ray afterglow of GRB 090205
shows a complex and interesting behaviour with a possible rebrightening at
500-1000s from the trigger time and late flaring activity. Photometric
observations of the GRB 090205 host galaxy argue in favor of a starburst galaxy
with a stellar population younger than ~ 150 Myr. Moreover, the metallicity of
Z > 0.27 Z_Sun derived from the GRB afterglow spectrum is among the highest
derived from GRB afterglow measurement at high-z, suggesting that the burst
occurred in a rather enriched envirorment. Finally, a detailed analysis of the
afterglow spectrum shows the existence of a line corresponding to Lyman-alpha
emission at the redshift of the burst. GRB 090205 is thus hosted in a typical
Lyman-alpha emitter (LAE) at z=4.65. This makes the GRB 090205 host the
farthest GRB host galaxy, spectroscopically confirmed, detected to date.

invariant, avoiding any special point or direction, thus satisfying the
Copernican Principle. A spatially inhomogeneous matter distribution can be
compatible with the Copernican Principle but not with the stronger version of
it, the Cosmological Principle which requires the additional hypothesis of
spatial homogeneity. We establish criteria for testing that a given density
field, in a finite sample at low redshifts, is statistically and/or spatially
homogeneous. The basic question to be considered is whether a distribution is,
at different spatial scales, self-averaging. This can be achieved by studying
the probability density function of conditional fluctuations. We find that
galaxy structures in the SDSS samples, the largest currently available, are
spatially inhomogeneous but statistically homogeneous and isotropic up to ~ 100
Mpc/h. Evidences for the breaking of self-averaging are found up to the largest
scales probed by the SDSS data. The comparison between the results obtained in
volumes of different size allows us to unambiguously conclude that the lack of
elf-averaging is induced by finite-size effects due to long-range correlated
fluctuations. We finally discuss the relevance of these results from the point
of view of cosmological modeling.

spam, detecting communities and mirror sites, and more. This study is however
hampered by the necessity of storing a major part of huge graphs in the
external memory, which prevents efficient random access to edge (hyperlink)
lists. A number of algorithms involving compression techniques have thus been
presented, to represent Web graphs succinctly but also providing random access.
Those techniques are usually based on differential encodings of the adjacency
lists, finding repeating nodes or node regions in the successive lists, more
general grammar-based transformations or 2-dimensional representations of the
binary matrix of the graph. In this paper we present two Web graph compression
algorithms. The first can be seen as engineering of the Boldi and Vigna (2004)
method. We extend the notion of similarity between link lists, and use a more
compact encoding of residuals. The algorithm works on blocks of varying size
(in the number of input lines) and sacrifices access time for better
compression ratio, achieving more succinct graph representation than other
algorithms reported in the literature. The second algorithm works on blocks of
the same size, in the number of input lines, and its key mechanism is merging
the block into a single ordered list. This method achieves much more attractive
space-time tradeoffs.

holds for all cities or for the largest cities in the United States using a
massive dataset and its computing. A major problem around this issue is how to
define cities or city boundaries. Most of the investigations of Zipf's law rely
on the demarcations of cities imposed by census data, e.g., metropolitan areas
and census-designated places. These demarcations or definitions (of cities) are
criticized for being subjective or even arbitrary. Alternative solutions to
defining cities are suggested, but they still rely on census data for their
definitions. In this paper we demarcate urban agglomerations by clustering
street nodes (including intersections and ends), forming what we call natural
cities. Based on the demarcation, we found that Zipf's law holds remarkably
well for all the natural cities (over 2-4 million in total) across the United
States. There is little sensitivity for the holding with respect to the
clustering resolution used for demarcating the natural cities. This is a big
contrast to urban areas, as defined in the census data, which do not hold
stable for Zipf's law.

give also the possibility to constrain gravitational wave emission theories and
the equation of state of ultra dense matter. Particularly crucial to our
understanding is the measurement of the long term spin evolution of the
accreting neutron star. An open question is whether these accreting pulsars are
spinning up during an outburst and spinning down in quiescence as predicted by
the recycling scenario. Until now it has been very difficult to measure
torques, due to the presence of fluctuations in the pulse phases that
compromise their measurements with standard coherent timing techniques. By
applying a new method, I am now able to measure a spin up during an outburst
and a spin down during quiescence. I ascribe the spin up
(Fdot=5.1(3)x10^{-13}\Hz/s) to accretion torques and the spin down
(Fdot=-3.0(8)x10^{-15} Hz/s) to magneto dipole torques, as those observed in
radio pulsars. Both values nicely fit in the recycling scenario and I infer the
existence of a magnetic field for the pulsar of B~2x10^{8} G. No evidence for
an enhanced spin down due to gravitational wave emission is found. The
accretion torques are smaller than previously reported and there is strong
evidence for an ordered process that is present in all outbursts that might be
connected with a motion of the hot spot on the neutron star surface.

final state radiation amplitudes interfere, making the medium-induced radiated

large-xF quarkonium hadroproduction. In this case, we show that the
medium-induced radiated energy is qualitatively similar (but not identical) to
the radiative energy loss of an ""asymptotic massive parton"" undergoing
transverse momentum broadening when travelling through the nucleus. In
particular, it scales as the incoming parton energy, which suggests to
reconsider gluon radiation as a possible explanation of large-xF quarkonium
suppression in p-A collisions. We expect a similar effect in open heavy-flavour

definition of the nuclear suppression factor in the latter case.

in order to investigate its warm gas content, assess the jet mass flux in the
form of H2 and probe for the existence of an embedded atomic jet. Methods:
Detected molecular and atomic lines are interpreted by means of emission line
diagnostics and an existing grid of molecular shock models. The physical
properties of the warm gas are compared against other molecular jet tracers and
to the results of a similar study towards the L1448-C outflow. Results: We have
detected and mapped the v=0-0 S(0) - S(7) H2 lines and fine-structure lines of
S, Fe+, and Si+. H2 is detected down to 5"" from the source and is characterized
by a ""cool"" T~300K and a ""warm"" T~1000 K component, with an extinction Av ~ 8
mag. The amount of cool H2 towards the jet agrees with that estimated from CO
assuming fully molecular gas. The warm component is well fitted by C-type
shocks with a low beam filling factor ~ 0.01-0.04 and a mass-flux similar to
the cool H2. The fine-structure line emission arises from dense gas with
ionization fraction ~0.5 - 5 x 10e-3, suggestive of dissociative shocks. Line
ratios to sulfur indicate that iron and silicon are depleted compared to solar
abundances by a factor ~10-50. Conclusions: Spitzer spectral mapping
observations reveal for the first time a cool H$_2$ component towards the CO
jet of HH211 consistent with the CO material being fully molecular and warm at
~ 300 K. The maps also reveal for the first time the existence of an embedded
atomic jet in the HH211 outflow that can be traced down to the central source
position. Its significant iron and silicon depletion excludes an origin from
within the dust sublimation zone around the protostar. The momentum-flux seems
insufficient to entrain the CO jet, although current uncertainties on jet speed
and shock conditions are too large for a definite conclusion.

much faster than the operating wavelength. We show that such modes are
dispersive due to the finiteness of the medium. Their dispersion relation is
established in a simple way, a link with designer plasmons is made, and the
canalization phenomenon is reinterpreted at the light of our model. We explain
how to take advantage of this dispersion in order to code sub-wavelength wave
fields in time. Finally, we show that the resonant nature of the medium ensures
an efficient coupling of these modes with free space propagating waves and,

is weak. Instead of acoustical treatment, a digital filter is used to eliminate
the effects of wall resonance and coincidence phenomena on recording of speech.
Sound insulation of studio is measured to calculate the wall resonance
frequency and the coincidence frequency. Pole /zero placement technique is used
to calculate the IIR filter coefficients. The digital filter is designed,
simulated and implemented. The proposed system is used to treat these problems
and it is shown to be effective in recording the noisy speech. In this work
digital signal processing is used instead of the acoustic treatment to
eliminate the effect of noise at the studio wall resonance. This technique is
cheap and effective in canceling the noise at the desired frequencies. Field
Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) is used for hardware implementation of the
proposed filter structure which provides fast and cheap solution for processing
real time audio signals. The implementation is carried out using Spartan chip

triggered sources are host to greater turbulent velocity dispersions, likely
indicative of shock motions within the cloud material. These may be attributed
to the passage of triggered shocks or simply the association of outflow
activity with the sources.
  In all, we have refined the Sugitani et al. (1991) catalogue to 15 clouds

analyzed in Nakagami-m fading channel, which provides accuracy and flexibility
in matching the signals statistics compared to other fading models. The
complexity which arises in the calculations of the RCPC codes parameters is
significantly reduced by using equivalent convolutional codes. Results show
that the use of high-rate code allows for bandwidth efficiency and at the same
time does not severely degrades the system performance. It is also shown that
the MMSE-based system outperforms the conventional ZF-based system especially

four different groups of bit-stream relative to its significances. The
significant bits, the sign bits, the set bits and the refinement bits are
transmitted in four different groups. The proposed method for reducing the PAPR
utilizes twice the unequal error protection (UEP), using the Read-Solomon codes
(RS), in conjunction with bit-rate allocation and selective interleaving to
provide minimum PAPR. The output bit-stream from the source code (SPIHT) will
be started by the most significant types of bits (first group of bits). The
optimal unequal error protection (UEP) of the four groups is proposed based on
the channel destortion. The proposed structure provides significant improvement
in bit error rate (BER) performance. Performed computer simulations have shown
that the proposed scheme outperform the performance of most of the recent PAPR
reduction techniques in most cases. Moreover, the simulation results indicate
that the proposed scheme provides significantly better PSNR performance in

characterise the nebular properties of late-type field galaxies. The
observations performed for this dissertation represent the first endeavour to
obtain full 2D coverage of the disks of a sample of nearby spiral galaxies, by
the application of the Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) technique, under the
PPAK IFS Nearby Galaxies Survey: PINGS. A self-consistent methodology is
defined in terms of observation, data reduction and analysis techniques for
this and upcoming IFS surveys, as well as providing a whole new set of IFS
visualization and analysis software made available for the public domain
(PINGSoft). The scientific analysis comprises the study of the integrated
properties of the ionized gas and a detailed 2D study from the emission line
spectra of four selected galaxies. Evidence is found suggesting that
measurements of emission lines of classical HII regions are not only aperture,
but spatial dependent, and therefore, the derived physical parameters and
metallicity content may significantly depend on the morphology of the region,
on the extraction aperture and on the signal-to-noise of the observed spectrum.
Furthermore, observational evidence of non-linear multi-modal abundance
gradients in normal spiral galaxies is found, consistent with a flattening in
the innermost and outermost parts of the galactic discs, with important
implications in terms of the chemical evolution of galaxies.

impedance led to an efficient method to improve array antenna performance. In
fact, a substantial saving on the whole surfaces as well as enhancement of the

bundling the resources in a known and prescribed fashion called Learning
objects. Learning Objects are composed of two aspects namely ""Learning"" and
""Object"". The Learning aspect of Learning objects refers to Education. Since
Education is a process so the primary aim of learning objects tends to be
facilitating acquisition, assessment and conversion of content into Learning
objects while fostering the assimilation of these Learning objects into
learning modules and instruction. The Object part of Learning objects relates
to the Digital Electronic format of the resources i.e. to say that it deals
with the physical resource that forms the Learning objects. The objects in LOs
are analogous to objects used in object-oriented modeling (OOM). The analogy
helps visualize how LOs will be packaged, processed and transported across the
digital library as well as utilized in course building. OOM concepts such as
encapsulation, classification, polymorphism, inheritance and reuse can be
borrowed to describe the operations on LOs in the digital library. Thus, the
aim of this paper is threefolds. Firstly, to discuss the background of this
research and the concept of Learning Objects. Secondly, to provide a framework
for adaptive mechanism for the retrieval of Learning Objects and thirdly to
highlight the benefits that this new proposed framework shall bring.

filter disk. In the known applications where Hall-effect sensors and magnets
(radially positioned) are applied, the purpose of the latter is to help
developing a binary code used mainly for filter identification. The number of
sensors is equal to the maximum number of magnets that participate in forming
the filter identity code. Therefore, three sensors and the corresponding number
of magnets radially positioned for each position are required for the
identification of seven filters. The precise position of the filter disk is
reached by counting up the steps of a stepper motor. The presented approach
applies only one Hall-effect sensor. The fore working front of one magnet,
positioned along the disk periphery, is used to precisely mark each filter
position. At a certain distance after the main magnet, a second one is
positioned in order to form an identity code. The paper contains an algorithm
for optical filter disk control and positioning, along with the mathematical
formalism on which it is based.

the low-frequency part of our result (omega << T), in which Hard Thermal Loop

rule out a sizeable coupling among the dark energy and dark matter fluids. We
explore a variety of coupled dark matter-dark energy models, which satisfy
cosmic microwave background constraints, in light of low redshift and near
universe observations. We illustrate the phenomenology of different classes of
dark coupling models, paying particular attention in distinguishing between
effects that appear only on the expansion history and those that appear in the
growth of structure. We find that while a broad class of dark coupling models
are effectively models where general relativity (GR) is modified --and thus can
be probed by a combination of tests for the expansion history and the growth of
structure--, there is a class of dark coupling models where gravity is still
GR, but the growth of perturbations is, in principle modified. While this
effect is small in the specific models we have considered, one should bear in
mind that an inconsistency between reconstructed expansion history and growth
may not uniquely indicate deviations from GR. Our low redshift constraints
arise from cosmic velocities, redshift space distortions and dark matter
abundance in galaxy voids. We find that current data constrain the
dimensionless coupling to be |xi|<0.2, but prospects from forthcoming data are
for a significant improvement. Future, precise measurements of the Hubble
constant, combined with high-precision constraints on the growth of structure,
could provide the key to rule out dark coupling models which survive other
tests. We shall exploit as well weak equivalence principle violation arguments,
which have the potential to highly disfavour a broad family of coupled models.

study the molecular gas in the Serpens North Cluster to probe the origin of the

C18O observed with the IRAM 30m telescope and JCMT are used to study the mass
and velocity structure of the region while the physical properties of the gas
are derived using LTE and non-LTE analyses of the three lowest transitions of
C18O. The molecular emission traces the two centres of star formation which are
seen in submillimetre dust continuum emission. In the ~40M_sun NW sub-cluster
the gas and dust emission trace the same structures although there is evidence
of some depletion of the gas phase C18O. The gas has a very uniform temperature
(~10K) and velocity (~8.5km/s) throughout the region. This is in marked
contrast to the SE sub-cluster. In this region the dust and the gas trace
different features, with the temperature peaking between the submillimetre
continuum sources, reaching up to ~14K. The gas in this region has double
peaked line profiles which reveal the presence of a second cloud in the line of
sight. The submillimetre dust continuum sources predominantly appear located in
the interface region between the two clouds. Even though they are at a similar
stage of evolution, the two Serpens sub-clusters have very different
characteristics. We propose that these differences are linked to the initial

with the goal of reconstructing the seismically active part of fault networks.
We first use an original method to separate clustered events from uncorrelated
seismicity using the distribution of volumes of tetrahedra defined by closest
neighbor events in the original and randomized seismic catalogs. The spatial
disorder of the complex geometry of fault networks is then taken into account
by defining faults as probabilistic anisotropic kernels, whose structures are
motivated by properties of discontinuous tectonic deformation and previous
empirical observations of the geometry of faults and of earthquake clusters at
many spatial and temporal scales. Combining this a priori knowledge with
information theoretical arguments, we propose the Gaussian mixture approach
implemented in an Expectation-Maximization (EM) procedure. A cross-validation
scheme is then used and allows the determination of the number of kernels that
should be used to provide an optimal data clustering of the catalog. This
three-steps approach is applied to a high quality relocated catalog of the
seismicity following the 1986 Mount Lewis ($M_l=5.7$) event in California and
reveals that events cluster along planar patches of about 2 km$^2$, i.e.
comparable to the size of the main event. The finite thickness of those
clusters (about 290 m) suggests that events do not occur on well-defined
euclidean fault core surfaces, but rather that the damage zone surrounding
faults may be seismically active at depth. Finally, we propose a connection
between our methodology and multi-scale spatial analysis, based on the
derivation of spatial fractal dimension of about 1.8 for the set of hypocenters
in the Mnt Lewis area, consistent with recent observations on relocated
catalogs.

spectroscopy to demonstrate that the energy $\varepsilon_H$ of the highest
occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of single-molecule transistors can be
controlled by a gate potential $V_G$. To demonstrate the linear dependence
$\varepsilon_H-V_G$, the experimental data have been interpreted by modeling
the molecule as an energy barrier spanning the spatial source-drain region of
molecular junctions. Since, as shown in this work, that crude model cannot
quantitatively describe the measured $I$-$V$-characteristics, it is important
to get further support for the linear dependence of $\varepsilon_H$ on $V_G$.
The results presented here, which have been obtained within a model of a

rely upon complementary descriptions, the present results indicate that the
interpretation of the experimental results as evidence for a gate controlled

two sources are aligned to within 5 degrees in the plane of the sky and the
tips of their bow-shocks point towards Sgr A*. Our measurements show that the
proper motion vectors of both features are pointing in directions more than 45
deg away from the line that connects them with Sgr A*. This misalignment of the
bow-shock symmetry axes and their proper motion vectors, combined with the high
proper motion velocities of several 100 km/s, suggest that the bow-shocks must
be produced by an interaction with some external fast wind, possibly coming
from Sgr A*, or stars in its vicinity. We have developed a bow-shock model to
fit the observed morphology and constrain the source of the external wind. The
result of our modeling allows us to estimate the velocity of the external wind,
making sure that all likely stellar types of the bow-shock stars are
considered. We show that neither of the two bow-shocks (one of which is clearly
associated with a stellar source) can be produced by influence of a stellar
wind of a single mass-losing star in the central parsec. Instead, an outflow
carrying a momentum comparable to the one contributed by the ensemble of the
massive young stars, can drive shock velocities capable of producing the
observed cometary features. We argue that a collimated outflow arising
perpendicular to the plane of the clockwise rotating stars (CWS), can easily
account for the two features and the mini-cavity. However, the collective wind
from the CWS has a scale of >10''. The presence of a strong, mass-loaded
outbound wind at projected distances from Sgr A* of <1'' is in fact in
agreement with models that predict a highly inefficient accretion onto the

fluctuations can imprint a systematic signature on the cosmological inferences
we make from distant sources. One example is the effect of a local
under-density on supernova cosmology. Also known as a Hubble-bubble, it has
been suggested that a large enough under-density could account for the
supernova magnitude- redshift relation without the need for dark energy or
acceleration. Although the size and depth of under-density required for such an
extreme result is extremely unlikely to be a random fluctuation in an
on-average homogeneous universe, even a small under-density can leave residual
effects on our cosmological inferences.
  In this paper we show that there remain systematic shifts in our cosmological
parameter measure- ments, even after excluding local supernovae that are likely
to be within any small Hubble-bubble. We study theoretically the low-redshift
cutoff typically imposed by supernova cosmology analyses, and show that a
low-redshift cut of z0 \sim 0.02 may be too low based on the observed
inhomogeneity in our local universe.
  Neglecting to impose any low-redshift cutoff can have a significant effect on
the cosmological pa- rameters derived from supernova data. A slight local
under-density, just 30% under-dense with scale 70h^{-1} Mpc, causes an error in
the inferred cosmological constant density {\Omega}{\Lambda} of \sim 4%.
Imposing a low-redshift cutoff reduces this systematic error but does not
remove it entirely. A residual systematic shift of 0.99% remains in the
inferred value {\Omega}{\Lambda} even when neglecting all data within the
currently pre- ferred low-redshift cutoff of 0.02. Given current measurement
uncertainties this shift is not negligible, and will need to be accounted for
when future measurements yield higher precision.

turbulence effect upon the neutrinos modelling the turbulence expected from
multi-dimensional simulations by adding matter density fluctuations to density
profiles taken from one-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations. We investigate
the impact upon the supernova neutrino transition probabilities as a function
of the neutrino mixing angle theta_13 and turbulence amplitude. In the high (H)

effectively two flavor for fluctuation amplitudes <~ 1% and have identified a
new effect due to the combination of turbulence and multiple H resonances that
leads to a sensitivity to fluctuations amplitudes as small as ~ 0.001%. At
small values of theta_13, beyond the range achievable in Earth based
experiments, we find that turbulence leads to new flavor transient effects in
the channel where the MSW H resonance occurs. Finally, we investigate large
amplitude fluctuations which lead to three flavor effects due to broken HL
factorization and significant non-resonant transitions and identify two

for both mathematics and physics. Yoshioka computed generating functions of
Poincare polynomials of such moduli spaces if the surface is the projective
plane P2 and the rank of the sheaves is 2. Motivated by physical arguments,
this paper investigates the modular properties of these generating functions.
It is shown that these functions can be written in terms of the Lerch sum and
theta function. Based on this, we prove a conjecture by Vafa and Witten, which
expresses the generating functions of Euler numbers as a mixed mock modular
form. Moreover, we derive an exact formula for the Fourier coefficients of this
function, which is similar to the Rademacher expansion for weakly holomorphic
modular forms but is more complicated. This is the first example of an exact
formula for the Fourier coefficients of mixed mock modular forms, which is of
independent mathematical interest.

channels, with very low residual contamination from the Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) anisotropies and controlled level of instrumental noise.
Foreground maps are obtained by subtraction of a properly filtered CMB map,
obtained from linear combinations of needlet-based representations of all WMAP
observations and of a 100-micron map. The error in the reconstructed foreground
maps on large scales is significantly lower than the original error due to CMB
contamination, while remaining of the order of the original WMAP noise on small
scales. The level of the noise is estimated, which permits to implement local
filters for maximising the local signal to noise ratio. An example of such
filtering, which reduces the small scale noise using latitude dependent filters
is implemented. This enhances significantly the contrast of galactic emission,
in particular on intermediate angular scales and at intermediate galactic
latitude. The clean WMAP foreground maps can be used to study the galactic
interstellar medium, in particular for the highest frequency channels for which
the proper subtraction of CMB contamination is mandatory. The foregrounds maps
can be downloaded from a dedicated web site.

resolution spectral map of the central region of the Cassiopeia A supernova
remnant, allowing us to make a Doppler reconstruction of its 3D structure. The
ejecta responsible for this emission have not yet encountered the remnant's
reverse shock or the circumstellar medium, making it an ideal laboratory for
exploring the dynamics of the supernova explosion itself. We observe that the
O, Si, and S ejecta can form both sheet-like structures as well as filaments.
Si and O, which come from different nucleosynthetic layers of the star, are
observed to be coincident in velocity space in some regions, and separated by
500 km/s or more in others. Ejecta traveling toward us are, on average, ~900
km/s slower than the material traveling away from us. We compare our
observations to recent supernova explosion models and find that no single model
can simultaneously reproduce all the observed features. However, models of
different supernova explosions can collectively produce the observed geometries
and structures of the interior emission. We use the results from the models to
address the conditions during the supernova explosion, concentrating on
asymmetries in the shock structure. We also predict that the back surface of
Cassiopeia A will begin brightening in ~30 years, and the front surface in ~100
years.

scales of $\sim$1 year, affect the dynamic structure of the plasmas responsible
for low ionization broad absorption lines. Variations of the ionizing continuum
produce non-equilibrium photoionization conditions over a significant fraction
of the absorbing clouds and supersonically moving ionization fronts. When the
flux drops the contraction of the ionized region drives a supersonic cooling
front towards the radiation source and a rarefaction wave in the opposite
direction. The pressure imbalance is compensated by an increased speed of the
cool gas relative to the front. When the flux recovers the cool gas is
re-ionized and re-heated by a supersonic ionization front traveling away from
the radiation source and a forward shock is created. The reheated clouds
equilibrate to a temperature of $\sim 10^4$ K and are observed to have
different radial velocities than the main cloud. Such fragmentation seems
consistent with the multicomponent structure of troughs seen in some objects.
The velocity differences measured among various components in the quasars QSO
2359--1241 and SDSS J0318--0600 can be reproduced by our model if strong
magnetic fields ($\sim$10 mG) are present within the clouds.

superfluids, the vortices carry zero-energy modes which obey non-abelian
exchange statistics and can potentially be used for topological quantum
computation. In such superfluids there may also exist other excitations below
the bulk gap inside the cores of vortices. We study the properties of these
subgap states, and argue that their presence affects the topological protection
of the zero modes. In conventional superconductors where the chemical potential
is of the order of the Fermi energy of a non-interacting Fermi gas, there is a
large number of subgap states and the mini-gap towards the lowest of these
states is a small fraction of the Fermi energy. It is therefore difficult to
cool the system to below the mini-gap and at experimentally available
temperatures, transitions between the subgap states, including the zero modes,
will occur and can alter the quantum states of the zero-modes. We show that
compound qubits involving the zero-modes and the parity of the occupation
number of the subgap states on each vortex are still well defined. However,
practical schemes taking into account all subgap states would nonetheless be
difficult to achieve. We propose to avoid this difficulty by working in the
regime of small chemical potential mu, near the transition to a strongly paired
phase, where the number of subgap states is reduced. We develop the theory to
describe this regime of strong pairing interactions and we show how the subgap
states are ultimately absorbed into the bulk gap. Since the bulk gap vanishes
as mu -> 0 there is an optimum value mu_c which maximises the combined gap. We
propose cold atomic gases as candidate systems where the regime of strong
interactions can be explored, and explicitly evaluate mu_c in a Feshbach
resonant K-40 gas.

problem is to determine whether a signal in the acoustic spectrum originates
from a radial or a dipolar oscillation mode. In order to overcome this problem,
we present a procedure for modelling and fitting the autocovariance of the
power spectrum which can be used to obtain global seismic parameters of
solar-type stars, doing so in an automated fashion without the need to make
subjective choices. From the set of retrievable global seismic parameters we
emphasize the mean small frequency separation and, depending on the intrinsic
characteristics of the power spectrum, the mean rotational frequency splitting.
Since this procedure is automated, it can serve as a useful tool in the
analysis of the more than one thousand solar-type stars expected to be observed
as part of the Kepler Asteroseismic Investigation (KAI). We apply the
aforementioned procedure to simulations of the Sun. Assuming different apparent
magnitudes, we address the issues of how accurately and how precisely we can
retrieve the several global seismic parameters were the Sun to be observed as
part of the KAI.

under the scientific and logistic coordination of the Centro de Modelado

including meteorological and hydrological forecasts, droughts, fire and flood
indices, ecosystems dynamics, climate and health applications, and five-day
high-resolution oceanographic predictions for the Eastern Pacific. This article
briefly describes the current products, methodologies and dynamical and
statistical modeling outputs provided by the OA. Also, a discussion on how
