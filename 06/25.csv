system (named as secondary system) dynamically accessing a spectrum licensed to
a primary network, thereby improving the efficiency of spectrum usage. A
cluster-based relay-assisted architecture is proposed for the secondary system,
where relay stations are employed for minimizing the interference to the users
in the primary network and achieving fairness for cell-edge users. Based on
this architecture, an asymptotically optimal solution is derived for jointly
controlling data rates, transmission power, and subchannel allocation to
optimize the average weighted sum goodput where the proportional fair
scheduling (PFS) is included as a special case. This solution supports
decentralized implementation, requires small communication overhead, and is
robust against imperfect channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT)
and sensing measurement. The proposed solution achieves significant throughput
gains and better user-fairness compared with the existing designs. Finally, we
derived a simple and asymptotically optimal scheduling solution as well as the
associated closed-form performance under the proportional fair scheduling for a
large number of users. The system throughput is shown to be
$\mathcal{O}\left(N(1-q_p)(1-q_p^N)\ln\ln K_c\right)$, where $K_c$ is the
number of users in one cluster, $N$ is the number of subchannels and $q_p$ is
the active probability of primary users.

at work in their atmospheres. Simultaneous Stroemgren-photometry allows to
obtain a rapid sequence of measurements in which photometric indices are
unaffected by non-optimum observing conditions. The indices y, b-y, and c_1 are
used with an established calibration to derive T_eff and to derive the gravity,
log g_BJ from the Balmer jump, throughout the pulsation cycle. By employing the
equations for stellar structure, additional parameters can be derived.
Stroemgren photometry and its calibration in terms of T_eff and log g can be
used to determine the run of R and the atmosphere pulsation velocity. We find
that the Balmer-line strengths are correlated with T_eff and that the strength
of the Ca_ii K line correlates well with the radius of the star and thus the
pulsation-dependent density of the atmosphere. The density in the stellar
atmosphere fluctuates as indicated by the changes in the gravity log g_BJ,
derived from c_1, between 2.3 and 4.5 dex. Also the Stroemgren metal index,
m_1, fluctuates. We find a disagreement between log g(T,L,M), the gravity
calculated from T_eff, L, and the mass M,and the gravity log g_BJ. This can be
used to reassess the mass and the absolute magnitude of an individual star.The
curves derived for the pulsational velocity V_pul differ from curves obtained
from spectra needed to apply the Baade-Wesselink method; we think these
differences are due to phase dependent differences in the optical depth levels
sampled in continuum photometry and in spectroscopy. We find an atmospheric
oscillation in these fundamental mode RR Lyrae stars of periodicity P/7.

known that solving the sequence assembly problem exactly on a bi-directed de
Bruijn graph or a string graph is intractable. However finding a Shortest
Double stranded DNA string (SDDNA) containing all the k-long words in the reads
seems to be a good heuristic to get close to the original genome. This problem
is equivalent to finding a cyclic Chinese Postman (CP) walk on the underlying
un-weighted bi-directed de Bruijn graph built from the reads. The Chinese
Postman walk Problem (CPP) is solved by reducing it to a general bi-directed
flow on this graph which runs in O(|E|2 log2(|V |)) time. In this paper we show
that the cyclic CPP on bi-directed graphs can be solved without reducing it to
bi-directed flow. We present a ?(p(|V | + |E|) log(|V |) + (dmaxp)3) time
algorithm to solve the cyclic CPP on a weighted bi-directed de Bruijn graph,
where p = max{|{v|din(v) - dout(v) > 0}|, |{v|din(v) - dout(v) < 0}|} and dmax
= max{|din(v) - dout(v)}. Our algorithm performs asymptotically better than the
bidirected flow algorithm when the number of imbalanced nodes p is much less
than the nodes in the bi-directed graph. From our experimental results on
various datasets, we have noticed that the value of p/|V | lies between 0.08%

proportions. Previous treatments of this process have used a with-replacement
approximation, which we show induces bias in estimates for large sample
fractions and differential network connectedness by characteristic of interest.
  We present a treatment of respondent-driven sampling as a successive sampling
process. Unlike existing representations, our approach respects the essential
without-replacement feature of the process, while converging to an existing
with-replacement representation for small sample fractions, and to the sample
mean for a full-population sample.
  We present a successive-sampling based estimator for population means based
on respondent-driven sampling data, and demonstrate its superior performance
when the size of the hidden population is known. We present sensitivity
analyses for unknown population sizes. In addition, we note that like other
existing estimators, our new estimator is subject to bias induced by the
selection of the initial sample. Using data collected among three populations
in two countries, we illustrate the application of this approach to populations
with varying characteristics. We conclude that the successive sampling
estimator improves on existing estimators, and can also be used as a diagnostic
tool when population size is not known.

properties. Yet, room temperature ferromagnetism (RTFM) has recently been
experimentally reported in graphene (G-600) [Nano. Letters 9, 220 (2009)], the
origin of which remains still unexplored. Inspired by this observation, and in
attempt to trace the origin of RTFM, we here report on low temperature K-band
electron spin resonance (ESR) observations on G-600. Two distinct C-related
paramagnetic signals are revealed, both of a Lorentzian shape: a) a broad at g
= 2.00278 which can be attributed to graphitic-like (GL) carbon; b) a narrower
signal at g = 2.00288 which is associated with free radical like (FL) carbon.
No other signals could be detected. We speculate that the GL ESR signal may
come from the conductive {\pi}-carriers propagating in the interior of graphene
sheets, while the FL ESR signal may stem from the edges of graphene sheets due
to non-bonding localized electronic states. It is suggested that the long range
direct/indirect exchange interaction between GL and FL C-related magnetic spin
centers may lead to the reported RTFM, this pointing to C origin of the later.

spike-like emission followed by a very soft extended tail up to one hundred
seconds after the trigger. It is a faint (E_{iso}=5.8x10^{50}) nearby GRB
(z=0.383) that does not have an associated type Ib/c bright supernova (SN). For
these reasons, GRB 071227 has been classified as a short burst not fulfilling
the Amati relation holding for long burst. We check the classification of GRB
071227 provided by the fireshell model. In particular, we test whether this
burst is another example of a disguised short burst, after GRB 970228 and GRB
060614, and, for this reason, whether it fulfills the Amati relation. We
simulate GRB 071227 light curves in the Swift BAT 15-50 keV bandpass and in the
XRT (0.3-10 keV) energy band within the fireshell model. We perform simulations
of the tail in the 15-50 keV bandpass, as well as of the first part of the
X-ray afterglow. This infers that: E_{tot}^{e^\pm}=5.04x10^{51} erg,
B=2.0x10^{-4}, E_{P-GRB}/E_{aft}~0.25, and <n_{cbm}>=3.33 particles/cm^3. These
values are consistent with those of ""long duration"" GRBs. We interpret the
observed energy of the first hard emission by identifying it with the P-GRB
emission. The remaining long soft tail indeed fulfills the Amati relation.
Previously classified as a short burst, GRB 071227 on the basis of our analysis
performed in the context of the fireshell scenario represents another example
of a disguised short burst, after GRB 970228 and GRB 060614. Further
confirmation of this result is that the soft tail of GRB 071227 fulfills the

SDSSDR7 catalog, assuming a flat, CDM-dominated cosmology. The model includes
the effects of massive neutrinos, nonlinear matter clustering and nonlinear,
scale-dependent galaxy bias in a self-consistent manner. We first test the
accuracy of PT-model by comparing the model predictions with the halo power
spectrum in real- and redshift-space measured from simulations without massive
neutrinos. We show that the PT-model with bias parameters being properly
adjusted can fairly well reproduce the simulation results. As a result the
best-fit parameters obtained from the hypothetical parameter fitting recover,
within statistical uncertainties, the input cosmological parameters in
simulations, including an upper bound on neutrino mass, if the power spectrum
information up to k~0.15h/Mpc is used. However, for the redshift-space power
spectrum, the best-fit cosmological parameters show a sizable bias from the
input values if using the information up to k~0.2h/Mpc, probably due to
nonlinear redshift distortion effect. Given these tests, we decided, as a
conservative choice, to use the LRG power spectrum up to k=0.1h/Mpc in order to
minimize possible unknown nonlinearity effects. In combination with the recent
results from Wilkinson Microwave Background Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), we derive
a robust upper-bound on the sum of neutrino masses, given as m_nu,tot < 0.81eV
(95% C.L.), marginalized over other parameters including nonlinear bias
parameters and dark energy equation of state parameter. The neutrino mass limit
is improved by a factor of 1.85 compared to the limit from the WMAP5 alone,

on data for 32Si and 36Cl decay rates acquired at the Brookhaven National

15 year^-1) appropriate for solar synodic rotation rates reveals several
periodicities, the most prominent being one at 11.18 year^-1 with power 20.76.
We evaluate the significance of this peak in terms of the false-alarm

indicate that the peak at 11.18 year^-1 would arise by chance only once out of
about 10^7 trials. Since there are several peaks in the search band, we also
investigate the running mean of the power spectrum, and identify a major peak
at 11.93 year^-1 with peak running-mean power 4.08. Application of the shuffle

cross-section differences and asymmetries of linearly and circularly polarised

$\h_\gamma(x)=\log^{-\gamma}(\frac{1}{x})$, $\gamma>0$, we construct a set
$E_\gamma\in F_{\h_\gamma}$ of Hausdorff dimension not greater than 1/2. Since
in a previous work we showed that 1/2 is a lower bound for the Hausdorff
dimension of any $E\in F_{\h_\gamma}$, with the present construction, the value
1/2 is sharp for the whole class of Furstenberg sets associated to the zero
dimensional functions $\h_\gamma$.

13 star-forming galaxies with asymmetric morphologies in the ultraviolet. Aided
by optical broad-band and H-alpha imaging, we interpret the asymmetric features
as being due to star formation within gas stripped from the galaxies by
interaction with the cluster environment. The selected objects display a range
of structures from broad fan-shaped systems of filaments and knots
(`jellyfish') to narrower and smoother tails extending up to 100 kpc in length.
Some of the features have been discussed previously in the literature, while
others are newly identified here. As an ensemble, the candidate stripping
events are located closer to the cluster centre than other star-forming
galaxies; their radial distribution is similar to that of all cluster members,
dominated by passive galaxies. The fraction of blue galaxies which are
undergoing stripping falls from 40% in the central 500 kpc, to less than 5%
beyond 1 Mpc. We find that tails pointing away from (i.e. galaxies moving
towards) the cluster centre are strongly favoured (11/13 cases). From the small
number of `outgoing' galaxies with stripping signatures we conclude that the
stripping events occur primarily on first passage towards the cluster centre,
and are short-lived compared to the cluster crossing time. Using infall
trajectories from simulations, the observed fraction of blue galaxies
undergoing stripping can be reproduced if the events are triggered at a
threshold radius of ~1 Mpc and detectable for ~500 Myr. HST images are
available for two galaxies from our sample and reveal compact blue knots
coincident with UV and H-alpha emission, apparently forming stars within the
stripped material. Our results confirm that stripping of gas from infalling
galaxies, and associated star formation in the stripped material, is a
widespread phenomenon in rich clusters.

between the established and the conjectured. In addition to the well-known
phase of a paramagnetic metal with a ""large"" Fermi surface (P_L), there is also
an antiferromagnetic phase with a ""small"" Fermi surface (AF_S). We provide the
details of the derivation of a quantum non-linear sigma-model (QNLsM)
representation of the Kondo lattice Hamiltonian, which leads to an effective
field theory containing both low-energy fermions in the vicinity of a Fermi
surface and low-energy bosons near zero momentum. An asymptotically exact
analysis of this effective field theory is made possible through the
development of a renormalization group procedure for mixed fermion-boson
systems. Considerations on how to connect the AF_S and P_L phases lead to a
global phase diagram, which not only puts into perspective the theory of local
quantum criticality for antiferromagnetic heavy fermion metals, but also
provides the basis to understand the surprising recent experiments in
chemically-doped as well as pressurized YbRh2Si2. We point out that the AF_S
phase still occurs for the case of an equal number of spin-1/2 local moments
and conduction electrons. This observation raises the prospect for a global
phase diagram of heavy fermion systems in the Kondo-insulator regime. Finally,
we discuss the connection between the Kondo breakdown physics discussed here
for the Kondo lattice systems and the non-Fermi liquid behavior recently
studied from a holographic perspective.

reactive substrates have established that the majority of triple-line motion
occurs when inertial effects are dominant. In light of these studies, this
paper investigates wetting and spreading on reactive substrates when inertial
effects are dominant using a thermodynamically derived, diffuse interface model
of a binary, three-phase material. The liquid-vapor transition is modeled using
a van der Waals diffuse interface approach, while the solid-fluid transition is
modeled using a phase field approach. The results from the simulations
demonstrate an $O \left( t^{-\nicefrac{1}{2}} \right)$ spreading rate during
the inertial regime and oscillations in the triple-line position when the metal
droplet transitions from inertial to diffusive spreading. It is found that the
spreading extent is reduced by enhancing dissolution by manipulating the
initial liquid composition. The results from the model exhibit good qualitative
and quantitative agreement with a number of recent experimental studies of
high-temperature droplet spreading, particularly experiments of copper droplets
spreading on silicon substrates. Analysis of the numerical data from the model
suggests that the extent and rate of spreading is regulated by the spreading
coefficient calculated from a force balance based on a plausible definition of
the instantaneous interface energies. A number of contemporary publications
have discussed the likely dissipation mechanism in spreading droplets. Thus, we
examine the dissipation mechanism using the entropy-production field and
determine that dissipation primarily occurs in the locality of the triple-line
region during the inertial stage, but extends along the solid-liquid interface
region during the diffusive stage.

Racing Association (JRA). As the number of votes t increases, the win bet
fraction x(t) converges to the final win bet fraction x_{f}. We observe the
power law $(x(t)-x_{f})^{2} \propto t^{-\beta}$ with $\beta\simeq 0.488$. We
measure the degree of the completeness of the ordering of the horses using an
index AR, the horses are ranked according to the size of the win bet fraction.
AR(t) also obeys the power law and behaves as
$\mbox{AR}_{f}-\mbox{AR}(t)\propto t^{-\gamma}$ with $\gamma\simeq 0.589$,
where AR_{f} is the final value of AR. We introduce a simple voting model with
two types of voters-independent and herding. Independent voters provide
information about the winning probability of the horses and herding voters
decide their votes based on the popularities of the horses.This model can
explain two power laws of the betting process. The component ratio of the
independent voter to the herding voter is 1:3.

trailing tidal arm of the Sagittarius dwarf (Sgr). The abundances were derived
by comparing synthetic spectra with high-resolution infrared spectra obtained
with the Phoenix spectrograph on the Gemini South telescope. The targeted stars
are drawn from two regions of the Sgr trailing arm separated by 66 degrees (5
stars) and 132 degrees (6 stars) from the main body of Sgr. The trailing arm
provides a more direct diagnostic of the chemical evolution of Sgr compared to
the extensively phase-mixed leading arm.
  Within our restricted sample of ~2-3 Gyr old stars, we find that the stream
material exhibits a significant metallicity gradient of -(2.4\pm0.3)x10^{-3}
dex / degree (-(9.4\pm1.1)x10^{-4} dex / kpc) away from the main body of Sgr.
The tidal disruption of Sgr is a relatively recently event. We therefore
interpret the presence of a metallicity gradient in the debris as indicative of
a similar gradient in the progenitor. The fact that such a metallicity gradient
survived for almost a Hubble time indicates that the efficiency of radial
mixing was very low in the Sgr progenitor.
  No significant gradient is seen to exist in the [alpha/Fe] abundance ratio
along the trailing arm. Our results may be accounted for by a radial decrease
in star formation efficiency and/or radial increase in the efficiency of
galactic wind-driven metal loss in the chemical evolution of the Sgr
progenitor. The [Ti/Fe] and [O/Fe] abundance ratios observed within the stream
are distinct from those of the Galactic halo. We conclude that the fraction of
the intermediate to metal-rich halo population contributed by the recent
dissolution (<3 Gyr) of Sgr-like dwarf galaxies can not be substantial.

importance in quantum information and quantum foundations, but often difficult
to perform. We present an experimental approach which can in principle be used
to perform arbitrary POVMs in a linear-optical context. One of the most
interesting POVMs, the SIC-POVM, is the most compact, set of measurements that
can be used to fully describe a quantum state. We use our technique to carry
out the first experimental characterization of the state of a qutrit using
SIC-POVMs. Because of the highly symmetric nature of this measurement, such a
representation has the unique property that it permits all other measurement
outcomes to be predicted by a simple extension of the classical Bayesian sum
rule, making no use of complex amplitudes or Hilbert-space operators. We
demonstrate this approach on several qutrit states encoded in single photons.

eccentric orbit about a much more massive Schwarzschild black hole and use the
numerically computed perturbations to solve for the metric. The calculations
are initially made in the frequency domain and provide Fourier-harmonic modes
for the gauge-invariant master functions that satisfy inhomogeneous versions of
the Regge-Wheeler and Zerilli equations. These gravitational master equations
have specific singular sources containing both delta function and
derivative-of-delta function terms. We demonstrate in this paper successful
application of the method of extended homogeneous solutions, developed recently
by Barack, Ori, and Sago, to handle source terms of this type. The method
allows transformation back to the time domain, with exponential convergence of
the partial mode sums that represent the field. This rapid convergence holds
even in the region of $r$ traversed by the point mass and includes the
time-dependent location of the point mass itself. We present numerical results
of mode calculations for certain orbital parameters, including highly accurate
energy and angular momentum fluxes at infinity and at the black hole event
horizon. We then address the issue of reconstructing the metric perturbation
amplitudes from the master functions, the latter being weak solutions of a
particular form to the wave equations. The spherical harmonic amplitudes that
represent the metric in Regge-Wheeler gauge can themselves be viewed as weak
solutions. They are in general a combination of (1) two differentiable
solutions that adjoin at the instantaneous location of the point mass (a result
that has order of continuity $C^{-1}$ typically) and (2) (in some cases) a
delta function distribution term with a computable time-dependent amplitude.

The latter are a fundamental tool in molecular dynamics simulation for sampling

discretization of the constrained Langevin process based on a standard
splitting strategy. We show how to correct the scheme so that it samples {\em
exactly} the canonical measure restricted on a submanifold, using a Metropolis
rule in the spirit of the Generalized Hybrid Monte Carlo (GHMC) algorithm.
Moreover, we obtain, in some limiting regime, a consistent discretization of
the overdamped Langevin (Brownian) dynamics on a submanifold, also sampling
exactly the correct canonical measure with constraints. The corresponding
numerical methods can be used to sample (without any bias) a probability
measure supported by a submanifold. (ii) For free energy computation using
thermodynamic integration, we rigorously prove that the longtime average of the
Lagrange multipliers of the constrained Langevin dynamics yields the gradient
of a rigid version of the free energy associated with the constraints. A second
order time discretization using the Lagrange multipliers is proposed. (iii) The
Jarzynski-Crooks fluctuation relation is proved for Langevin processes with
mechanical constraints evolving in time. An original numerical discretization
without time-step error is proposed. Numerical illustrations are provided for
(ii) and (iii).

first time as heterogeneous seeds to multi-seed successfully the melt growth of
bulk YBCO in a multi-seeded melt growth (MSMG) process. The use of thin film
seeds, which may be prepared with highly controlled orientation (i.e. with a
well-defined a-b plane and precisely known a-direction), is based on their
superheating properties and reduces significantly contamination of the bulk
sample by the seed material. A variety of grain boundaries were obtained by
varying the angle between the seeds. Microstructural studies indicate that the
extent of residual melt deposited at the grain boundary decreases with
increasing grain boundary contact angle. It is established that the growth
front proceeds continuously at the (110)/(110) grain boundary without trapping
liquid, which leads to the formation of a clean grain boundary.

associations between single loci and a specific phenotype. However, a

multiple loci and the environment. In this paper, we describe a two-stage
method for detecting epistasis by combining the traditionally used single-locus
search with a search for multiway interactions. Our method is based on an
extended version of Fisher's exact test. To perform this test, a Markov chain
is constructed on the space of multidimensional contingency tables using the
elements of a Markov basis as moves. We test our method on simulated data and
compare it to a two-stage logistic regression method and to a fully Bayesian
method, showing that we are able to detect the interacting loci when other
methods fail to do so. Finally, we apply our method to a genome-wide data set
consisting of 685 dogs and identify epistasis associated with canine hair

preferred sense of the Faraday rotation-measure gradients across jets from

deterministic relationship between the polarity of the poloidal magnetic field
that threads the outflow and the sense of rotation of the outflow's source.
Based on this interpretation, Countopoulos et al. suggested that their finding
supports a model for the origin of cosmic magnetic fields in a
Poynting-Robertson process operating in AGN accretion discs. Here I point out
that an alternative explanation of such a relationship could be that the Hall
current plays a key role in the magnetohydrodynamics of the underlying disc. In
this picture, the measured Faraday rotation is dominated by the contribution of
a centrifugally driven wind that is launched from the weakly ionized outer
region of the disc. Additional observations are, however, needed to verify the
claimed behaviour.

photometric BVRI and spectroscopic observations covering the wavelength band
4000-7000 A. The blue spectra allow us to determine the spectral type and
luminosity class of the optical companion; the red spectra, together with the
photometric magnitudes, were used to derive the colour excess E(B-V) and
estimate the distance. We have carried out the first detailed optical study of
the massive component in the high-mass X-ray binary IGR J06074+2205. We find
that the optical counterpart is a V=12.3 B0.5Ve star located at a distance of
~4.5 kpc. The monitoring of the Halpha line reveals V/R variability and an
overall decline of its equivalent width. The Halpha line has been seen to
revert from an emission to an absorption profile. We attribute this variability
to global changes in the structure of the Be star's circumstellar disc which
eventually led to the complete loss of the disc. The density perturbation that
gives rise to the V/R variability vanishes when the disc becomes too small.

the representation and show how the associated Jordan-Wigner procedure
naturally defines the so called branch cuts that connect the topological vortex
excitations. Using this notion of the branch cuts we show how to, in the
non-Abelian phase of the model, describe the Majorana zero mode structure
associated with vortex excitations. Furthermore we show how, by intersecting
the edges between Abelian and non-Abelian domains, the branch cuts dictate the
character of the chiral edge modes. In particular we will see in what
situations the exact zero energy Majorana edge modes exist. On a cylinder, and
for the particular instances where the Abelian phase of the model is the full
vacuum, we have been able to exactly solve for the systems edge energy
eigensolutions and derive a recursive formula that exactly describes the edge
mode structure. Penetration depth is also calculated and shown to be dependent
on the momentum of the edge mode. These solutions also describe the overall
character of the fully open non-Abelian domain and are excellent approximations
at moderate distances from the corners.

1758-258 has not yet been unambiguously identified to have an
optical/near-infrared counterpart, mainly because of the high absorption and
the historic lack of suitable astrometric stars, which led to the use of
secondary astrometric solutions. Although it is considered with 1E 1740.7-2942

origin of both sources has not yet been confirmed. Aims. We attempt to improve
previous astrometry to identify a candidate counterpart to GRS 1758-258. We
present observations with the Gran Telescopio de Canarias (GTC), in which we
try to detect any powerful emission lines that would infer an extragalactic
origin of this source. Methods. We use modern star catalogues to reanalyze
archival images of the GRS 1758-258 field in the optical and near-infrared
wavelengths, and compute a new astrometric solution. We also reanalyzed
archival radio data of GRS 1758-258 to determine a new and more accurate radio
position. Results. Our improved astrometric solution for the GRS 1758-258 field
represents a significant advancement on previous works and allows us to
identify a single optical/near-infrared source, which we propose as the
counterpart of GRS 1758-258. The GTC spectrum of this source is however of low
signal-to-noise ratio and does not rule out a Galactic origin. Hence, new
spectral observations are required to confirm or discard a Galactic nature.

been a milestone on the way to automated termination techniques, of which we
have seen an extensive development over the past years. Both the semantic
characterisation and most known termination methods are concerned with global
termination, uniformly of all the terms of a term rewriting system (TRS). In
this paper we consider local termination, of specific sets of terms within a
given TRS. The principal goal of this paper is generalising the semantic
characterisation of global termination to local termination. This is made
possible by admitting the well-founded monotone algebras to be partial. We also
extend our approach to local relative termination. The interest in local
termination naturally arises in program verification, where one is probably
interested only in sensible inputs, or just wants to characterise the set of
inputs for which a program terminates. Local termination will be also be of
interest when dealing with a specific class of terms within a TRS that is known
to be non-terminating, such as combinatory logic (CL) or a TRS encoding
recursive program schemes or Turing machines. We show how some of the
well-known techniques for proving global termination, such as stepwise removal
of rewrite rules and semantic labelling, can be adapted to the local case. We
also describe transformations reducing local to global termination problems.
The resulting techniques for proving local termination have in some cases
already been automated. One of our applications concerns the characterisation
of the terminating S-terms in CL as regular language. Previously this language
had already been found via a tedious analysis of the reduction behaviour of
S-terms. These findings have now been vindicated by a fully automated and
verified proof.

selected galaxies in the COSMOS field spanning the redshift range 0.01<z< 3.5
with a median redshift of 0.5 and an infrared luminosity range of
10^8<L_IR<10^14L_sun with a median luminosity of 10^11.4 L_sun. In general
these galaxies are massive, with a stellar mass range of 10^10-10^12 M_sun, and
luminous, with -25<M_K<-20. We find a strong correlation between the fraction
of major mergers and L_IR, with the fraction at the highest luminosity being up
to 50%. We also find that the fraction of spirals drops dramatically with L_IR.
Minor mergers likely play a role in boosting the infrared luminosity for
sources with low luminosities. The precise fraction of mergers in any given
L_IR bin varies by redshift due to sources at z>1 being difficult to classify
and subject to the effects of band pass shifting, therefore, these numbers can
only be considered lower limits. At z<1, where the morphological
classifications are most robust, major mergers clearly dominate the ULIRG
population (50-80%) and are important for the LIRG population (25-40%). At z>1
the fraction of major mergers is at least 30-40% for ULIRGs. Although the
general morphological trends agree with what has been observed for local
(U)LIRGs, the fraction of major mergers is slightly lower than seen locally.
This is in part due to the difficulty of identifying merger signatures at high
redshift. We argue that given the number of major gas-rich mergers observed and
the relatively short timescale that they would be observable in the (U)LIRG
phase that it is plausible for the observed red sequence of massive ellipticals
(<10^12 M_sun) to have been formed entirely by gas-rich major mergers.

electronic/nuclear spin cross-relaxation in the rotating reference frame. It is
shown that this decoherence is accompanied with energy dissipation in the range
of the Rabi frequencies w_N - sigma_e < Omega_R < w_N, where sigma_e is the
mean super-hyperfine field (in frequency units) induced by protons at SMMs.
Weaker damping without dissipation takes place outside this dissipation window.

detection of crystalline water ice as well as absorption in the 2.2\mu m

to be homogeneous over time (and probably rotation) at the resolution
available. From Hapke radiative transfer models involving intimate mixtures of
various ices we find for the first time that ammonium (NH+4) and traces of
ethane (C2 H6), which are most probably solar irradiation products of ammonia
and methane, and a mixture of methane and ammonia (diluted or not) are the best
candidates to improve the description of the data with respect to a simple
water ice mixture (Haumea type surface). The possible more subtle structure of
the 2.2\mu m band(s) should be investigated thoroughly in the future for Orcus

ammonia chemistry at work, if any. We investigated the thermal history of Orcus

input 10% porosity, bulk composition of 23% amorphous water ice and 77% dust,
and cold accretion show that even with the action of long-lived radiogenic
elements only, Orcus should have a melted core and most probably suffered a
cryovolcanic event in its history which brought large amounts of crystalline
ice to the surface. The presence of ammonia in the interior would strengthen
the melting process. The crystalline water ice possibly brought to the surface
by a past cryovolcanic event sbe detectable after several billion years despite
the irradiation eects, as demonstrated by recent laboratory experiments.

a kink near the antiferromagnetic phase transition temperature T_N ~ 70 K

peaks were revealed in the THz spectra close to 43 and 73 cm-1. While the first
peak corresponds to a sharp antiferromagnetic resonance exhibiting softening on
heating towards TN, the second one may be attributed to an impurity mode or a
multiphonon absorption peak. High-temperature THz spectra measured up to 900 K

phonon softening observed in the infrared reflectance spectra upon heating.

galactic stellar spheroids. However, the expected super-solar iron abundance of
the hot gas is not observed. Instead, X-ray observations often show decreasing
iron abundance toward galactic central regions, where the Ia SN enrichment is
expected to be the highest. We examine the cause of this missing iron problem
by studying the enrichment process and its effect on X-ray abundance
measurements of the hot gas. The evolution of Ia SN iron ejecta is simulated in
the context of galaxy-wide hot gas outflows, in both supersonic and subsonic
cases, as may be expected for hot gas in galactic bulges or elliptical galaxies
of intermediate masses. SN reverse-shock heated iron ejecta is typically found
to have a very high temperature and low density, hence producing little X-ray
emission. Such hot ejecta, driven by its large buoyancy, can quickly reach a
substantially higher outward velocity than the ambient medium, which is
dominated by mass loss from evolved stars. The ejecta is gradually and
dynamically mixed with the medium at large galactic radii. The ejecta is also
slowly diluted and cooled by {\sl insitu} mass injection from evolved stars.
These processes together naturally result in the observed positive gradient in
the average radial iron abundance distribution of the hot gas, even if
mass-weighted. This trend is in addition to the X-ray measurement bias that
tends to underestimate the iron abundance for the hot gas with a temperature
distribution.

fields $B>10T_K$. On the other hand, the Kondo peak splitting $\delta/T_K$ in
the total spectral function does slightly deviate from the conventional scaling
theory in whole magnetic field window along the coupling-varying path.
Furthermore, we show the scaling analysis suitable for all field windows within
the Kondo regime and two specific fitting scaling curves are given from which
certain detailed features at low field are derived. In addition, the scaling
dimensionless quantity $\Delta/2B$ and $\delta/2B$ are also studied and they
can reach and exceed 1 in the large magnetic field region, in agreement with a
recent experiment [T.M. Liu, et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 026803 (2009)].

formulated by Schmidt: the power-law expression assumed to relate the rate of
star formation in a volume of space to the local total gas volume density.
Volume densities in the clouds surrounding an OB association are determined
with a simple model which considers atomic hydrogen as a photodissociation
product on cloud surfaces. The photodissociating flux incident on the cloud is
computed from the far-UV luminosity of the OB association and the geometry. We
have applied this ""PDR Method"" to a sample of star-forming regions in M33 using
VLA 21-cm data for the HI and GALEX imagery in the far-UV. It provides an
estimate of the total volume density of hydrogen (atomic + molecular) in the
gas clouds surrounding the young star cluster. A logarithmic graph of the
cluster UV luminosity versus the surrounding gas density is a direct measure of
the star formation law. However, this plot is severely affected by
observational selection, rendering large areas of the diagram inaccessible to
the data. An ordinary least-squares regression fit therefore gives a strongly
biased result. Its slope primarily reflects the boundary defined when the 21-cm
line becomes optically thick, no longer reliably measuring the HI column
density. We use a maximum-likelihood statistical approach which can deal with
truncated and skewed data, taking into account the large uncertainties in the
derived total gas densities. The exponent we obtain for the Schmidt law in M33
is 1.4 \pm 0.2.

The innermost part of these systems is likely a corona with different

electrons Comptonize soft X-ray photons from the disk that partially penetrates
the corona, producing emission up to $\sim 150$ keV, well beyond the
expectations for an optically thick disk of maximum temperature $\sim 10^{7}$
K. However, sources such as Cygnus X-1 produce steady emission up to a few MeV,
which is indicative of a non-thermal contribution to the spectral energy
distribution. We study the radiative output produced by the injection of
non-thermal (both electron and proton) particles in a magnetized corona around
a black hole. Energy losses and maximum energies are estimated for all types of
particles in a variety of models, characterized by different kinds of advection
and relativistic proton content. Transport equations are solved for primary and

Phosphorous (P) and Boron (B) doped systems, acceptors behaving as tunnel
barriers for the electrons, while donors give rise to Fano resonances in the
transmission. (2) As a consequence, the mobility is much larger in P- than in
B-doped nanowires at low carrier density, but can be larger in B-doped
nanowires at high carrier density. (3) The resistance of a single impurity is
strongly dependent on its radial position in the nanowire, especially for
acceptors. (4) As a result of subband structure and screening effects, the
impurity-limited mobility can be larger in thin nanowires embedded in HfO2 than
in bulk Si. Acceptors might, however, strongly hinder the flow of electrons in
thin nanowires embedded in SiO2. (5) The perturbative LBTE largely fails to

supernova remnants (SNRs) in the starburst galaxy M82 is analyzed in a
statistically more robust manner than in the previous studies that mainly
discussed sample quality and related selection effects. The statistics of data
fits in log {\Sigma} - log D plane are analyzed by using vertical (standard)
and orthogonal regressions. As the parameter values of D - {\Sigma} and
{\Sigma} - D fits are invariant within the estimated uncertainties for
orthogonal regressions, slopes of the empirical {\Sigma} - D relations should
be determined by using the orthogonal regression fitting procedure. Thus
obtained {\Sigma} - D relations for samples which are not under severe
influence of the selection effects could be used for estimating SNR distances.
Using the orthogonal regression fitting procedure {\Sigma} - D slope {\beta}
\approx 3.9 is obtained for the sample of 31 SNRs in M82. The results of
implemented Monte Carlo simulations show that the sensitivity selection effect
does not significantly influence the slope of M82 relation. This relation could
be used for estimation of distances to SNRs that evolve in denser interstellar
environment, with number denisty up to 1000 particles per cm3 .

The
effect of the deformation on the conductivity is twofold: The lattice
distortion can be represented as pseudovector potential in the Dirac equation
formalism, whereas the gate causes inhomogeneous density redistribution. We use
the elasticity theory to find the profile of the graphene sheet and then
evaluate the conductivity by means of the transfer matrix approach. We find
that the two effects provide functionally different contributions to the
conductivity. For small deformations and not too high residual stress the
correction due to the charge redistribution dominates and leads to the
enhancement of the conductivity. For stronger deformations, the effect of the
lattice distortion becomes more important and eventually leads to the
suppression of the conductivity. We consider homogeneous as well as local
deformation. We also suggest that the effect of the charge redistribution can
be best measured in a setup containing two gates, one fixing the overall charge
density and another one deforming graphene locally.

through a gate-controlled quantum dot under quantized Hall conditions originate
from a true Aharonov-Bohm phase that is acquired by the electrons as they
co-propagate coherently through incompressible strips at a particular filling
factor and enclose a certain magnetic flux within the dot. The absence of
oscillations at certain filling factors is explained. The self-consistent
screening theory of the integer quantized hall effect reveals the range of
experimental parameters under which further intriguing oscillation patterns are
observable.

Pirjol we work out predictions for B -> K* l+ l-, l = (e, mu), decays for a
softly recoiling K*, i.e., for large dilepton masses sqrt{q^2} of the order of
the b-quark mass m_b. We work to lowest order in Lambda/Q, where Q = (m_b,
sqrt{q^2}) and include the next-to-leading order corrections from the charm
quark mass m_c and the strong coupling at O(m_c^2/Q^2, alpha_s). The leading
Lambda/m_b corrections are parametrically suppressed. The improved Isgur-Wise
form factor relations correlate the B -> K* l+ l- transversity amplitudes,
which simplifies the description of the various decay observables and provides
opportunities for the extraction of the electroweak short distance couplings.
We propose new angular observables which have very small hadronic
uncertainties. We exploit existing data on B -> K* l+ l- distributions and show
that the low recoil region provides powerful additional information to the
large recoil one. We find disjoint best-fit solutions, which include the
Standard Model, but also beyond-the-Standard Model ones. This ambiguity can be
accessed with future precision measurements.

reinforcement learning-assisted genetic algorithm to evolve the epuck
behaviours, which are encoded as a genetic sequence. This sequence is then used
by the Pioneers as part of an adaptive, idiotypic artificial immune system
(AIS) control architecture. Testing in three different simulated worlds shows
that the Pioneer can use these behaviours to navigate and solve object-tracking
tasks successfully, as long as its adaptive AIS mechanism is in place.
