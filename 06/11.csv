in optical lattices for two-dimensional systems. Considering the many-body
screening of dipolar interactions at intermediate and larger filling factors,
we show that several superfluid phases with distinct pairing symmetries
naturally arise in the singlet channel: local s-wave $(sl)$, extended s-wave
$(se)$, d-wave $(d)$ or time-reversal-symmetry breaking $(sl + se \pm
id)$-wave. We obtain the temperature versus filling factor phase diagram and
show that d-wave pairing is favored near half-filling, that $(sl + se)$-wave is
favored near zero or full filling, and that time-reversal-breaking $(sl + se
\pm id)$-wave is favored in between. The inclusion of a harmonic trap reveals
that a sequence of phases can coexist in the cloud depending on the filling
factor at the center of the trap. Most notably in the spatial region where the
$(sl + se \pm id)$-wave superfluid occurs, spontaneous currents are generated,
and may be detected using velocity sensitive Bragg spectroscopy.

strong jets but with different properties. These differences may be associated
to the central engine and/or the external medium. Aims: The AGN classification
FRI and FRII can be linked to the rate of electromagnetic Poynting flux
extraction from the inner corona of the central engine by the jet. The
collimation results from the distribution of the total electromagnetic energy
across the jet, as compared to the corresponding distribution of the thermal
and gravitational energies. We use exact solutions of the fully relativistic
magnetohydrodynamical (GRMHD) equations obtained by a nonlinear separation of
the variables to study outflows from a Schwarzschild black hole corona. A
strong correlation is found between the jet features and the energetic
distribution of the plasma of the inner corona which may be related to the
efficiency of the magnetic rotator. It is shown that observations of FRI and
FRII jets may be partially constrained by our model for spine jets. The
deceleration observed in FRI jets may be associated with a low magnetic
efficiency of the central magnetic rotator and an important thermal confinement
by the hot surrounding medium. Conversely, the strongly collimated and
accelerated FRII outflows may be self collimated by their own magnetic field
because of the high efficiency of the central magnetic rotator.

dynamics of a quantum subsystem coupled to a classical environment.
Representing this equation in the mapping basis leads to a continuous
description of discrete quantum states of the subsystem and may provide an
alternate route to the construction of simulation schemes. In the mapping basis
the quantum-classical Liouville equation consists of a Poisson bracket
contribution and a more complex term. By transforming the evolution equation,
term-by-term, back to the subsystem basis, the complex term (excess coupling
term) is identified as being due to a fraction of the back reaction of the
quantum subsystem on its environment. A simple approximation to
quantum-classical Liouville dynamics in the mapping basis is obtained by
retaining only the Poisson bracket contribution. This approximate mapping form
of the quantum-classical Liouville equation can be simulated easily by
Newtonian trajectories. We provide an analysis of the effects of neglecting the
presence of the excess coupling term on the expectation values of various types
of observables. Calculations are carried out on nonadiabatic population and
quantum coherence dynamics for curve crossing models. For these observables,
the effects of the excess coupling term enter indirectly in the computation and
good estimates are obtained with the simplified propagation.

search procedures with provable performance guarantees for a broad class of

minimization of an objective function defined using the Frobenius metric, has
inherent difficulties: the objective function is not continuous and the
solution set is not closed. To address this problem, we consider an
optimization procedure that searches for a column (or row) space that is
geometrically consistent with the partial observations. The geometric objective
function is continuous everywhere and the solution set is the closure of the
solution set of the Frobenius metric. We also preclude the existence of local
minimizers, and hence establish strong performance guarantees, for special
completion scenarios, which do not require matrix incoherence or large matrix

positron fraction and Fermi electronic excesses. For those theories with a
TeV-scale WIMP annihilating through a light force-carrier, the associated
Sommerfeld enhancement provides a natural explanation of the large boost factor
needed to explain the signals, and the light force-carrier naturally gives rise
to hard cosmic ray spectra without excess pi0 gamma rays or anti-protons. The
Sommerfeld enhancement of the annihilation rate, which at low relative
velocities v scales as 1/v, relies on the comparatively low velocity dispersion
of the dark matter particles in the smooth halo. Dark matter substructures in
which the velocity dispersion is smaller than in the smooth halo have even
larger annihilation rates. N-body simulations containing only dark matter
predict the existence of such structures, for example subhalos and caustics,
and the effects of these substructures on dark matter indirect detection
signals have been studied extensively. The addition of baryons into
cosmological simulations of disk-dominated galaxies gives rise to an additional
substructure component, a dark disk. The disk has a lower velocity dispersion
than the spherical halo component by a factor ~6, so the contributions to dark
matter signals from the disk can be more significant in Sommerfeld models than
for WIMPs without such low-velocity enhancements. We consider the consequences
of a dark disk on the observed signals of cosmic rays as measured by Fermi and
PAMELA in models where the WIMP annihilations are into a light boson. We find
that both the PAMELA and Fermi results are easily accomodated by scenarios in
which a disk signal is included with the standard spherical halo signal. Limits
from extrapolations to the center of the galaxy can also be modified.

Needs revision",,,,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We determine the evolution of the co-moving density of the most massive ($M_*
\geq 10^{12} M_\odot$) early-type galaxy population in the redshift range of $z
= 0.15$ - 0.45 in different stellar mass ranges using data from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS DR7) catalog. We find that the
co-moving number density of these galaxies grew exponentially, weakly depending
on the stellar mass range, as a function of cosmic time with a time-scale of
$\tau \simeq 1.16 \pm 0.16$ Gyr for at least 4 Gyr ending around $z \simeq
0.15$. This is about a factor of ten of growth between $z=0.5$ - 0.15. Since $z
\simeq 0.15$ a constant co-moving number density can be measured. According to
theoretical models the most massive early-type galaxies gain most of their
stellar mass via dry merging but the major merger rate measured by others
cannot account for the high growth in number density we measured thus, stellar
mass gain from minor mergers and slow, smooth accretion seems to play an
important role. We outline a simple analytic model that explains the observed
evolution based on the exponential decline of the luminosity function and sets
constraints on the time dependence of the close-pair fraction of merger
candidate galaxies.

confining gauge theories. In the large $N$ limit, gauge theories compactified
on $\R^{d-k} \times (S^1)^k$ are independent of the $S^1$ radii, provided the
theory has unbroken center symmetry. In particular, this implies that a large
$N$ gauge theory which, on $\R^d$, flows to an IR fixed point, retains the
infinite correlation length and other scale invariant properties of the
decompactified theory even when compactified on $\R^{d-k} \times (S^1)^k$. In

D) is computed as the ratio between the luminosity distance DL and 1 + z.
Mathematically D results to be a power series of the light-space r run inside
the expanding cosmic medium or Hubble flow; thus its expression is independent
of the corresponding z. In addition one can have D = D(z, h) from the ECM
Hubble law by using the h convention with an anisotropic HX. It is proposed to
the meeting that the wedge-shape of this new Hubble diagram be confirmed
independently as mainly due to the ECM dipole anisotropy of the Hubble ratio
cz/D.

del Pezzo surfaces, where the BPS degeneracies of quivers corresponding to one
D6 brane bound to arbitrary numbers of D4, D2 and D0 branes are counted by
melting crystal configurations. We show that the melting crystals that arise
are a discretization of the Calabi-Yau geometry. The shape of the crystal is
determined by the Calabi-Yau geometry and the background B-field, and its
microscopic structure by the quiver Q. We prove that the BPS degeneracies
computed from Q and Q' are related by the Kontsevich Soibelman formula, using a
geometric realization of the Seiberg duality in the crystal. We also show that,
in the limit of infinite B-field, the combinatorics of crystals arising from
the quivers becomes that of the topological vertex. We thus re-derive the

searches using the LAT, onboard the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. Five of
the eight pulsars are young (tau_c<100 kyr), energetic (Edot>10^36 erg/s), and
located within the Galactic plane (|b|<3 deg). The remaining three are older,
less energetic, and located off the plane. Five pulsars are associated with
sources included in the LAT bright gamma-ray source list, but only one, PSR
J1413-6205, is clearly associated with an EGRET source. PSR J1023-5746 has the
smallest characteristic age (tau_c=4.6 kyr) and is the most energetic
(Edot=1.1E37 erg/s) of all gamma-ray pulsars discovered so far in blind
searches. PSRs J1957+5033 and J2055+25 have the largest characteristic ages
(tau_c~1 Myr) and are the least energetic (Edot~5E33 erg/s) of the
newly-discovered pulsars. We present the timing models, light curves, and
detailed spectral parameters of the new pulsars. We used recent XMM
observations to identify the counterpart of PSR J2055+25 as XMMU
J205549.4+253959. In addition, publicly available archival Chandra X-ray data
allowed us to identify the likely counterpart of PSR J1023-5746 as a faint,
highly absorbed source, CXOU J102302.8-574606. The large X-ray absorption
indicates that this could be among the most distant gamma-ray pulsars detected
so far. PSR J1023-5746 is positionally coincident with the TeV source HESS
J1023-575, located near the young stellar cluster Westerlund 2, while PSR
J1954+2836 is coincident with a 4.3 sigma excess reported by Milagro at a
median energy of 35 TeV. Deep radio follow-up observations of the eight pulsars
resulted in no detections of pulsations and upper limits comparable to the
faintest known radio pulsars, indicating that these can be included among the
growing population of radio-quiet pulsars in our Galaxy being uncovered by the
LAT, and currently numbering more than 20.

solar nebula discs using three-dimensional self-gravitating radiation
hydrodynamical (RHD) models. The protoplanets are free to migrate, whereupon
their migration rates are measured. For low mass protoplanets (10-50 M_\oplus)
we find increases in the migration timescales of up to an order of magnitude
between locally-isothermal and RHD models. In the high-mass regime the
migration rates are changed very little. These results are arrived at by
calculating migration rates in locally-isothermal models, before sequentially
introducing self-gravity, and radiative transfer, allowing us to isolate the
effects of the additional physics. We find that using a locally-isothermal
equation of state, without self-gravity, we reproduce the migration rates
obtained by previous analytic and numerical models. We explore the impact of
different protoplanet models, and changes to their assumed radii, upon
migration. The introduction of self-gravity gives a slight reduction of the
migration rates, whilst the inertial mass problem, which has been proposed for
high mass protoplanets with circumplanetary discs, is reproduced. Upon
introducing radiative transfer to models of low mass protoplanets (\approx 10
M_\oplus), modelled as small radius accreting point masses, we find outward
migration with a rate of approximately twice the analytic inward rate. However,
when modelling such a protoplanet in a more realistic manner, with a surface
which enables the formation of a deep envelope, this outward migration is not
seen.

evolutionary phase, we analyse the properties of quasar host galaxies. In this
paper, we present a population synthesis modeling technique for off-axis
spectra, the results of which constrain host colour and the stellar ages of
luminous quasars (M_V(nuc)<-23). Our technique is similar to well established
quiescent-galaxy models, modified to accommodate scattered nuclear light (a
combination of atmospheric, instrumental and host galaxy scattered light)
observed off axis. In our model, subtraction of residual scattered quasar light
is performed, while simultaneously modeling the constituent stellar populations
of the host galaxy. The reliability of this technique is tested via a
Monte-Carlo routine in which the correspondence between synthetic spectra with
known parameters and the model output is determined. Application of this model
to a preliminary sample of 10 objects is presented and compared to previous
studies. Spectroscopic data was obtained via long-slit and integral-field unit
observations on the Keck and WIYN telescopes. We confirm that elliptical quasar
hosts are distinguishable (bluer) from inactive ellipticals in rest frame B-V
colour. Additionally, we note a trend for radio luminous (L_5GHz > 10^40 erg
s^-1) quasars to be located in redder host galaxies in comparison to their less
luminous radio counterparts. While the host colour and age of our radio
luminous sample is in close proximity to the green valley, our radio faint
sample is consistent with quiescent star-forming galaxies. However, further
observations are needed to confirm these results. Finally, we discuss future
applications for our technique on a larger sample of objects being obtained via
SALT and WIYN telescope observing campaigns.

photometry of 74 robust counterparts to 68 of the 126 submillimetre galaxies
(SMGs) selected at 870um by LABOCA observations in the ECDFS. The median
photometric redshift of identified SMGs is z=2.2\pm0.1, the interquartile range
is z=1.8-2.7 and we identify 10 (~15%) high-redshift (z>3) SMGs. We derive a
simple redshift estimator for SMGs based on the 3.6 and 8um fluxes, which is
accurate to Delta_z~0.4 for SMGs at z<4. A statistical analysis of sources
around unidentified SMGs identifies a population of likely counterparts with a
redshift distribution peaking at z=2.5\pm0.3, which likely comprises ~60% of
the unidentified SMGs. This confirms that the bulk of the undetected SMGs are
coeval with those detected in the radio/mid-IR. We conclude that ~15% of all
the SMGs are below the flux limits of our survey and lie at z>3 and hence ~30%
of all SMGs have z>3. We estimate that the full S_870um>4mJy SMG population has
a median redshift of 2.5\pm0.6. In contrast to previous suggestions we find no
significant correlation between S_870um and redshift. The median stellar mass
of the SMGs derived from SED fitting is (9.2\pm0.9)x10^10Msun and the
interquartile range is (4.7-14)x10^10Msun, although we caution that uncertainty
in the star-formation histories results in a factor of ~5 uncertainty in these
stellar masses. The median characteristic dust temperature of SMGs is
35.9\pm1.4K and the interquartile range is 28.5-43.3K. The infrared luminosity
function shows that SMGs at z=2-3 typically have higher far-IR luminosities and
luminosity density than those at z=1-2. This is mirrored in the evolution of
the star-formation rate density (SFRD) for SMGs which peaks at z~2. The maximum
contribution of bright SMGs to the global SFRD (~5% for SMGs with S_870um>4mJy;
~50% for SMGs with S_870um>1mJy) also occurs at z~2.

of hyperbolic conservation laws have recently generated a fair bit of interest.
The ADER time update can be carried out in a single step, which is desirable in
many applications. However, prior papers have focused on the theory while
downplaying implementation details. The purpose of the present paper is to make
ADER schemes accessible by providing two useful formulations of the method as
well as their implementation details on three-dimensional structured meshes. We
therefore provide a detailed formulation of ADER schemes for conservation laws
with non-stiff source terms in nodal as well as modal space along with useful
implementation-related detail. We also provide details for the efficient use of
ADER schemes in obtaining the numerical flux for conservation laws as well as
electric fields for divergence-free magnetohydrodynamics. An efficient
WENO-based strategy for obtaining zone-averaged magnetic fields from
face-centered magnetic fields in MHD is also presented.
  The schemes catalogued here have been implemented in the first author's
RIEMANN code. The speed of ADER schemes is shown to be almost twice as fast as
that of strong stability preserving Runge-Kutta time stepping schemes for all
the orders of accuracy that we tested.

single electron, or Umklapp backscattering of two electrons. To lowest order in
the backscattering interactions the partial decay rates are additive. At zero
doping the corresponding decay rates scale as power-laws of the temperature
with positive and negative exponents for the two mechanisms, respectively. The
precise values of the exponents depend on the Luttinger liquid parameter. At
finite doping the decay rates are described by universal crossover functions of
frequency and chemical potential measured in units of temperature. In the
evaluation of the plasmon decay, we concentrate on a finite-length geometry
allowing excitation of plasma resonances.

with >200 ks X-ray coverage, only 7 are formally detected in the X-ray and four
lack X-ray emission at even the 2 sigma level. Spitzer IRS spectra, however,
confirm that all of the sources are AGN-dominated in the mid-IR, although half
have detectable PAH emission responsible for ~25% of their mid-infrared flux
density. When combined with other samples, this indicates that at least 30-40%
of luminous IRBGs have star-formation rates in the ULIRG range (~100-2000
Msun/yr). X-ray hardness ratios and MIR to X-ray luminosity ratios indicate
that all members of the sample contain heavily X-ray obscured AGN, 80% of which
are candidates to be Compton-thick. Furthermore, the mean X-ray luminosity of
the sample, log L(2-10 keV)(ergs/s)=44.6, indicates that these IRBGs are Type 2
QSOs, at least from the X-ray perspective. While those sources most heavily
obscured in the X-ray are also those most likely to display strong silicate
absorption in the mid-IR, silicate absorption does not always accompany X-ray
obscuration. Finally, ~70% of the IRBGs are merger candidates, a rate
consistent with that of sub-mm galaxies (SMGs), although SMGs appear to be
physically larger than IRBGs. These characteristics are consistent with the
proposal that these objects represent a later, AGN-dominated, and more relaxed
evolutionary stage following soon after the star-formation-dominated one
represented by the SMGs.

members possess unique identifiers and, sometimes, additional features called

satisfies several important desiderata: (i) labels may be ordinal or nominal,
(ii) side-information can be easily exploited if present, (iii) with or without

resistant to sample-selection bias, (v) it can learn well-calibrated

no existing method satisfies all the above criteria. In particular, many
methods assume that the labels are ordinal and ignore side-information when it

primordial power spectrum, implicitly assuming that a very small oscillation in
the inflaton potential creates a negligible change in the predicted halo mass
function. We show that this is not true. We find that a small oscillating
perturbation in the inflaton potential in the slow-roll regime can alter
significantly the predicted number of small halos. A class of models derived
from supergravity theories gives rise to inflaton potentials with a large
number of steps and many transplanckian effects may generate oscillations in
the primordial power spectrum. The potentials we study are the simple quadratic
(chaotic inflation) potential with superimposed small oscillations for small
field values. Without leaving the slow-roll regime, we find that for a wide
choice of parameters, the predicted number of halos change appreciably. For the
oscillations beginning in the 10^7-10^8 solar masses range, for example, we
find that only a 5% change in the amplitude of the chaotic potential causes a
50% suppression of the number of halos for masses between 10^7-10^8 solar
masses and an increase in the number of halos for masses <10^6 solar masses by
factors ~15-50. We suggest that this might be a solution to the problem of the
lack of observed dwarf galaxies in the range 10^7-10^8 solar masses. This might
also be a solution to the reionization problem where a very large number of
Population III stars in low mass halos are required.

infrared luminosity (L_IR) of IRGs strongly depend on the morphology of and the
distance to the nearest neighbor galaxy: the probability for an IRG to be a
(U)LIRG (f_(U)LIRGs) and its L_IR both increase as it approaches a late-type
galaxy, but decrease as it approaches an early-type galaxy (within half the
virial radius of its neighbor). We find no dependence of f_(U)LIRGs on the
background density (surface galaxy number density) at fixed stellar mass of
galaxies. The dependence of f_(U)LIRGs on the distance to galaxy clusters is
also found to be very weak, but in highest-density regions such as the center
of galaxy clusters, few (U)LIRGs are found. These environmental dependence of
LIRGs and ULIRGs and the evolution of star formation rate (SFR)-environment

morphology. In addition to the classical double-lobed structure they have a
pair of low-luminosity wings that straddles the nucleus at almost right angles
to the active lobes, thus giving the impression of an 'X'. In this paper we
study for the first time the optical spectral properties of this object class
using a large sample (~50 sources). We find that the X-shaped radio population
is composed roughly equally of sources with weak and strong emission line
spectra, which makes them, in combination with the well-known fact that they
preferentially have radio powers intermediate between those of Fanaroff-Riley
type I (FR I) and type II (FR II) radio galaxies, the archetypal transition
population. We do not find evidence in support of the proposition that the
X-shape is the result of a recent merger: X-shaped radio sources do not have
unusually broad emission lines, their nuclear environments are in general not
dusty, and their host galaxies do not show signs of enhanced star formation.
Instead, we observe that the nuclear regions of X-shaped radio sources have
relatively high temperatures. This finding favours models, which propose that
the X-shape is the result of an overpressured environment.

the plateau condition is met for the Nilsson model but not for the Woods-Saxon
model is understood in a new interpretation of the Strutinsky smoothing
procedure as a low-pass filter. Essential features of Kruppa's level density is
extracted in terms of the Thomas-Fermi approximation modified to describe
spectra obtained from diagonalization in truncated oscillator bases. A method
is proposed which weakens the dependence on the smoothing width by applying the
Strutinsky smoothing only to the deviations from a reference level density. The
BCS equations are modified for the Kruppa's spectrum, which is necessary to
treat the pairing correlation properly in the presence of continuum. The
potential depth is adjusted for the consistency between the microscopic and

organic species during star- and planet-formation. Through a series of
laboratory experiments, we investigate the effects of the H2O concentration,
the dominant ice constituent in space, on the photochemistry of more volatile
species, especially CH4, in ice mixtures. In the experiments, thin (~40 ML) ice
mixtures, kept at 20-60 K, are irradiated under ultra-high vacuum conditions
with a broad-band UV hydrogen discharge lamp. Photodestruction cross sections
of volatile species (CH4 and NH3) and production efficiencies of new species
(C2H6, C2H4, CO, H2CO, CH3OH, CH3CHO and CH3CH2OH) in water-containing ice
mixtures are determined using reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy
during irradiation and during a subsequent slow warm-up. The four major effects
of increasing the H2O concentration are 1) an increase of the destruction
efficiency of the volatile mixture constituent by up to an order of magnitude
due to a reduction of back reactions following photodissociation, 2) a shift to
products rich in oxygen e.g. CH3OH and H2CO, 3) trapping of up to a factor of
five more of the formed radicals in the ice and 4) a disproportional increase
in the diffusion barrier for the OH radical compared to the CH3 and HCO
radicals. The radical diffusion temperature dependencies are consistent with
calculated H2O-radical bond strengths. All the listed effects are potentially
important for the production of complex organics in H2O-rich icy grain mantles

been useful in determining the critical behavior from the size dependent
behaviors of thermodynamic quantities. When the phase transition is
discontinuous, however, FSS approach has not been well established yet. Here,
we develop a FSS theory for the explosive percolation transition arising in the
Erd\H{o}s and R\'enyi model under the Achlioptas process. A scaling function is
derived based on the observed fact that the derivative of the curve of the
order parameter at the critical point $t_c$ diverges with system size in a
power-law manner, which is different from the conventional one based on the
divergence of the correlation length at $t_c$. We show that the susceptibility
is also described in the same scaling form. Numerical simulation data for
different system sizes are well collapsed on the respective scaling functions.

for solving low-rank matrix completion problems. The algorithm takes as its
input a subset of entries of a low-rank matrix, and outputs one low-rank matrix
consistent with the given observations. The completion task is accomplished by
searching for a column space on the Grassmann manifold that matches the
incomplete observations. The SET algorithm consists of two parts -- subspace
evolution and subspace transfer. In the evolution part, we use a gradient
descent method on the Grassmann manifold to refine our estimate of the column
space. Since the gradient descent algorithm is not guaranteed to converge, due
to the existence of barriers along the search path, we design a new mechanism
for detecting barriers and transferring the estimated column space across the
barriers. This mechanism constitutes the core of the transfer step of the
algorithm. The SET algorithm exhibits excellent empirical performance for both
high and low sampling rate regimes.

how to reduce continuous logic to rational Pavelka logic. We also define
notions of computability and decidability of a model for logics with
computable, but uncountable, set of truth values; show that provability degree
of a formula w.r.t. a linear theory is computable, and use this to carry out an

linear theory in continuous logic, we effectively produce its decidable model.
This is the best possible, since we show that the computable model theory of
continuous logic is an extension of computable model theory of classical logic.
We conclude with noting that the unique separable model of a separably

the paired wings spatially asymmetrical on the solar equator. It is inferred
that hemispherical solar activity strength should evolve in a similar way

(2--5 um) of NGC300-OT were obtained for the first time. They show no prominent
emission nor absorption features, but are dominated by continuum thermal
emission from the dust around NGC300-OT. NIR images were taken in the 2.4, 3.2,

the dust temperature of 810 (+-14) K at 398 days and 670 (+-12) K at 582 days.
We attribute the observed NIR emission to the thermal emission from dust grains
formed in the ejecta of NGC300-OT. The multi-epoch observations enable us to
estimate the dust optical depth as larger than about 12 at 398 days and larger
than about 6 at 582 days at 2.4 um, by assuming an isothermal dust cloud. The
observed NIR emission must be optically thick, unless the amount of dust grains
increases with time. Little extinction at visible wavelengths reported in
earlier observations suggests that the dust cloud around NGC300-OT should be
distributed inhomogeneously so as to not screen the radiation from the ejecta
gas and the central star. The present results suggest the dust grains are not
formed in spherically symmetric geometry, but rather in a torus, a bipolar
outflow, or clumpy cloudlets.

emitted a bright burst with a pronounced double-peak structure in hard X-rays,
reminiscent of the double-peak temporal structure seen in some bright
thermonuclear bursts on accreting neutron stars. In the latter case this is due
to Photospheric Radius Expansion (PRE): when the flux reaches the Eddington
limit, the photosphere expands and cools so that emission becomes softer and
drops temporarily out of the X-ray band, re-appearing as the photosphere
settles back down. We consider the factors necessary to generate double-peaked
PRE events, and show that such a mechanism could plausibly operate in magnetar
bursts, despite the vastly different emission process. Identification of the
magnetic Eddington limit in a magnetar would constrain magnetic field and
distance and could, in principle, enable a measurement of gravitational
redshift. It would also locate the emitting region at the neutron star surface,
constraining the burst trigger mechanism. Conclusive confirmation of PRE events
will require more detailed radiative models for bursts. However for SGR
0501+4516 the predicted critical flux (using the magnetic field strength
inferred from timing and the distance suggested by its probable location in the
Perseus arm of our Galaxy) is consistent with that observed in the August 24th

the security criteria that a quantum key distribution protocol must fulfill to
allow its safe use within a larger security application (e.g., for secure
message transmission). To illustrate the practical use of composability, we
show how to generate a continuous key stream by sequentially composing rounds
of a quantum key distribution protocol. In a second part, we take a more
general point of view, which is necessary for the study of cryptographic
situations involving, for example, mutually distrustful parties. We explain the
universal composability framework and state the composition theorem which

include the scenario in which the mutual interaction between the two principal
components (i.e., holographic dark energy and dark matter) of the universe
leads to some loss in other forms of cosmic constituents. Our model is valid
for any sign of $Q$ and $Q'$. If $Q<Q'$, then part of the dark energy density
decays into dark matter and the rest in the other unknown energy density
component. But if $Q>Q'$, then dark matter energy receives from dark energy and
from the unknown component of dark energy. Observation suggests that dark
energy decays into dark matter. Here we have presented a general prescription
of a cosmological model of dark energy which imposes mutual interaction between
holographic dark energy, dark matter and another fluid. We have obtained the
equation of state for the holographic dark energy density which is interacting

and ULIRGs) in the local universe are well known since large samples of these
objects have been the subject of numerous spectroscopic works. There are,
however, relatively few studies of large samples of LIRGs and ULIRGs using
integral field spectroscopy (IFS). We analyze optical (3800-7200A) IFS data
taken with the Potsdam Multi-Aperture Spectrophotometer (PMAS) of the central
few kiloparsecs of 11 LIRGs. To study the stellar populations we fit the
optical stellar continuum and the hydrogen recombination lines of selected
regions. We analyze the excitation conditions of the gas using the spatially
resolved properties of the brightest optical emission lines. The optical
continua of the selected regions are well fitted with a combination of evolved
(~0.7-10Gyr) and ionizing (1-20Myr) stellar populations. The latter is more
obscured than the evolved population, and has visual extinctions in good
agreement with those obtained from the Balmer decrement. Except for NGC 7771,
there is no clear evidence for an important contribution to the optical light
from an intermediate-aged population (~100-500Myr). Even after correcting for
the presence of stellar absorption, a large fraction of spaxels with low
observed equivalent widths of Halpha in emission still show enhanced
[NII]/Halpha and [SII]/Halpha ratios. These ratios are likely to be produced by
a combination of photoionization in HII regions and diffuse emission. These
regions of enhanced ratios are generally coincident with low surface brightness
HII regions and diffuse emission detected in the Halpha and Pa-alpha images.
Using the PMAS line ratios and the NICMOS Pa-alpha photometry of HII regions we
find that the fraction of diffuse emission in LIRGs varies from galaxy to
galaxy, and it is generally less than 60% as found in other starburst galaxies.

natural reference for extrsolar debris disks. We employ a new algorithm to
eliminate the inclination and the distance selection effects in the known TNO
populations to derive expected parameters of the ""true"" EKB. Its estimated mass
is M_EKB=0.12 M_earth, which is by a factor of \sim 15 larger than the mass of
the EKB objects detected so far. About a half of the total EKB mass is in
classical and resonant objects and another half is in scattered ones. Treating
the debiased populations of EKB objects as dust parent bodies, we then
""generate"" their dust disk with our collisional code. Apart from accurate
handling of collisions and direct radiation pressure, we include the
Poynting-Robertson (P-R) drag, which cannot be ignored for the EKB dust disk.
Outside the classical EKB, the radial profile of the optical depth
approximately follows tau \sim r^-2 which is roughly intermediate between the
slope predicted analytically for collision-dominated (r^-1.5) and
transport-dominated (r^-2.5) disks. The cross section-dominating grain size
still lies just above the blowout size (\sim 1...2 \microm), as it would
without the P-R transport. However, if the EKB were by one order of magnitude
less massive, the optical depth profile would fall off as tau \sim r^-3, and
the cross section-dominating grain size would shift from \sim 1...2\microm to
~100 \microm. These properties are seen if dust is assumed to be generated only
by known TNOs. If the solar system were observed from outside, the thermal
emission flux from the EKB dust would be about two orders of magnitude lower
than for solar-type stars with the brightest known infrared excesses observed
from the same distance. Herschel and other new-generation facilities should
reveal extrasolar debris disks nearly as tenuous as the EKB disk. The
Herschel/PACS instrument should be able to detect disks at a \sim 1...2M_EKB
level.

stationary Markovian stochastic processes affect the First Passage Time
distribution. First Passage Time issues are a classical topic in stochastic
processes research. They also have relevant applications, for example, in many
fields of finance such as the assessment of the default risk for firms' assets.
By using some explicit examples, in this paper we will show that the tail of
the First Passage Time distribution crucially depends on the correlation
properties of the process and it is independent from its stationary
distribution. When the process includes an infinite set of time-scales bounded
from above, the FPTD shows tails modulated by some exponential decay. In the
case when the process is power-law correlated the FPTD shows power-law tails
1/t^(alfa+1)/2 and therefore the moments <t^n> of the FPTD are finite only when
n< (alfa-1)/2. We will also show that such power-law behaviour is not merely
due to the fact that the process includes an infinite and unbounded set of
time-scales. Rather, the time-scale must enter the FPTD with weights that must
be distributed according to a power-law for large time-scales values. Finally,
we will give a general result connecting the FPTD of an additive stochastic
processes x(t) to the FPTD of a generic process y(t) related by a coordinate
transformation y=f(x) to the first one.

significantly modified from semiconducting to metallic states, by applying a
uniform perpendicular magnetic field (B-field). Here, we theoretically study
the bandgap modulation induced by a perpendicular B-field. The applied B-field
causes the lowest conduction subband and the top-most valence subband to move
closer to one another to form the n=0 Landau level. We exploit this effect to
realize a device relevant MR modulation. Unlike in conventional spin-valves,
this intrinsic MR effect is realized without the use of any ferromagnetic
leads. The AGNRs with number of dimers, Na=3p+1 [p=1,2,3,...] show the most
promising behavior for MR applications, with large conductance modulation and
hence, high MR ratio at the optimal source-drain bias. However, the MR is
suppressed at higher temperature due to the spread of the Fermi function
distribution. We also investigate the importance of the source-drain bias in
optimizing the MR. Lastly, we show that edge roughness of AGNRs has the
unexpected effect of improving the magnetic sensitivity of the device and thus
increasing the MR ratio.

Schwarzschild coordinates and in maximal-isotropic coordinates. An open problem
is the issue of global existence for initial data without size restrictions.
The main purpose of the present work is to propose a method of approach for
general initial data, which improves the regularity of the terms that need to
be estimated compared to previous methods. We prove that global existence holds
outside the centre in both these coordinate systems. In the Schwarzschild case
we improve the bound on the momentum support obtained in \cite{RRS} for compact
initial data. The improvement implies that we can admit non-compact data with
both ingoing and outgoing matter. This extends one of the results in
\cite{AR1}. In particular our method avoids the difficult task of treating the
pointwise matter terms. Furthermore, we show that singularities never form in
Schwarzschild time for ingoing matter as long as $3m\leq r.$ This removes an
additional assumption made in \cite{A1}. Our result in maximal-isotropic
coordinates is analogous to the result in \cite{R1}, but our method is
different and it improves the regularity of the terms that need to be estimated
for proving global existence in general.

This paper describes our real-time supernova detection and analysis procedures,

Convergence of second moments implies convergence in the $H^1$ Sobolev norm. We

essential use of this theory is made throughout our analysis.

search for trends in ejecta kinematics in the resulting Type II-Plateau (II-P)

larger ejecta velocities in a given progenitor. However, we emphasise that for
a given explosion energy, the increasing helium-core mass with main-sequence
mass of such Type II-P SN progenitors leads to ejection of core-embedded
oxygen-rich material at larger velocities. We find that the photospheric
velocity at 15d after shock breakout is a good and simple indicator of the
explosion energy in our selected set of pre-SN models. This measurement,
combined with the width of the nebular-phase OI6303-6363A line, can be used to
place an upper-limit on the progenitor main-sequence mass. Using the results
from our simulations, we find that the current, but remarkably scant, late-time
spectra of Type II-P SNe support progenitor main-sequence masses inferior to

difficult, progenitor identification in pre-explosion images. The narrow width

high-mass progenitors in the range 25-30Msun. Combined with quantitative

is characterized by its `natural' velocity v drawn from a distribution P(v).
The traffic flow is modeled as a collection of straight `world lines' in the
time-space plane, with overtaking events represented by a fixed queuing time
tau imposed on the overtaking vehicle. This geometrical model exhibits platoon
formation and allows, among many other things, for the calculation of the
effective average velocity w=\phi(v) of a vehicle of natural velocity v.
Secondly, we extend the model to two opposite lanes, A and B. We argue that the
queuing time \tau in one lane is determined by the traffic density in the
opposite lane. On the basis of reasonable additional assumptions we establish a
set of equations that couple the two lanes and can be solved numerically. It
appears that above a critical value \omega_bar_c of the control parameter
\omega_bar the symmetry between the lanes is spontaneously broken: there is a
slow lane where long platoons form behind the slowest vehicles, and a fast lane
where overtaking is easy due to the wide spacing between the platoons in the
opposite direction. A variant of the model is studied in which the spatial
vehicle density \rho_bar rather than the flux \omega_bar is the control
parameter. Unequal fluxes \omega_bar_A and \omega_bar_B in the two lanes are
also considered. The symmetry breaking phenomenon exhibited by this model, even

For simplicity we focus in the case when $F$ depends on the magnetic field
alone, a case dubbed in the bibliography as ''magnetic universe''. Our results
demonstrate that, depending on the values of the free parameter $m$, the
magnetic field can mimic phantom field behavior, an effect previously found in
other contexts. It is demonstrated that, since there are found equilibrium
points in the phase space of these models that can be associated with
magnetic-dominated past and future attractors, a combination of positive and
negative powers of $F$ may lead to interesting cosmological behavior. In
particular, a cosmological scenario where the universe might evolve from a past
NLED-driven (non-inflationary) state into a future (late-time) -- also
NLED-driven -- inflationary stage, transiting through a matter-dominated
solution, is envisioned. The impact of braneworld gravity on the dynamics
driven by such NLED Lagrangeans is also investigated. It is demonstrated that,
due to phantom property at late times, the non-linear electromagnetic effects
may play an important role in deciding the fate of the cosmic evolution.
Randall-Sundrum brane effects, in particular, modify the nature of the starting
point of the cosmic evolution, as well as the fate of the expansion: both, the

perform many molecular dynamic simulations of the breaking stress at different
coupling parameters (inverse temperatures) and strain rates. We describe our
results with the Zhurkov model of strength. We apply this model to estimate the
breaking stress for timescales ~1 s - 1 year, which are most important for
applications, but much longer than can be directly simulated. At these
timescales the breaking stress depends strongly on the temperature. For
coupling parameter <200, matter breaks at very small stress, if it is applied
for a few years. This viscoelastic creep can limit the lifetime of mountains on
neutron stars. We also suggest an alternative model of timescale-independent
breaking stress, which can be used to estimate an upper limit on the breaking

the average physical sizes smaller by factors ~3 than local early type galaxies
(ETGs) endowed with the same stellar mass. Small sizes are in fact expected on
theoretical grounds, if dissipative collapse occurs. Recent results show that
the size evolution at z<1 is limited to less than 40%, while most of the
evolution occurs at z>1, where both compact and already extended galaxies are
observed and the scatter in size is remarkably larger than locally. The
presence at high z of a significant number of ETGs with the same size as their
local counterparts as well as of ETGs with quite small size, points to a
timescale to reach the new, expanded equilibrium configuration of less than the
Hubble time. We demonstrate that the projected mass of compact, high-z galaxies
and that of local ETGs within the *same physical radius*, the nominal
half-luminosity radius of high-z ETGs, differ substantially, in that the high-z
ETGs are on the average significantly denser. We propose that quasar activity,
which peaks at z~2, can remove large amounts of gas from central galaxy regions
on a timescale shorter than of the dynamical one, triggering a puffing up of
the stellar component at constant stellar mass; in this case the size increase
goes together with a decrease of the central mass. The size evolution is
expected to parallel that of the quasars and the inverse hierarchy, or
downsizing, seen in the quasar evolution is mirrored in the size evolution.

and in a diverse number of real systems -such as some food-webs and electronic

graphs (DAGs). An important ingredient of the analysis of such networks is a
proper comparison of their observed architecture against an ensemble of
randomized graphs, thereby quantifying the {\em randomness} of the real systems
with respect to suitable null models. This approximation is particularly
relevant when the finite size and/or large connectivity of real systems make
inadequate a comparison with the predictions obtained from the so-called {\em
configuration model}. In this paper we analyze four methods of DAG
randomization as defined by the desired combination of topological invariants
(directed and undirected degree sequence and component distributions) aimed to
be preserved. A highly ordered DAG, called \textit{snake}-graph and a
Erd\:os-R\'enyi DAG were used to validate the performance of the algorithms.
Finally, three real case studies, namely, the \textit{C. elegans} cell lineage
network, a PhD student-advisor network and the Milgram's citation network were
analyzed using each randomization method. Results show how the interpretation
of degree-degree relations in DAGs respect to their randomized ensembles depend
on the topological invariants imposed. In general, real DAGs provide disordered
values, lower than the expected by chance when the directedness of the links is
not preserved in the randomization process. Conversely, if the direction of the
links is conserved throughout the randomization process, disorder indicators
are close to the obtained from the null-model ensemble, although some
deviations are observed.

mentors with large fecundity train proteges that go on to have a 29% larger

in presence of a plasma inhomogeneity, and of a gravity. The second effect
leads, even in a uniform plasma, to a difference of the gravitational photon
deflection angle from the vacuum case, and to its dependence on the photon
frequency. We take into account both effects, and derive the expression for the
lensing angle in the case of a strongly nonuniform plasma in presence of the
gravitation. Dependence of the lensing angle on the photon frequency in a
homogeneous plasma resembles the properties of a refractive prism spectrometer,
which strongest action is for very long radiowaves. We discuss the
observational appearances of this effect for the gravitational lens with a
Schwarzschild metric, surrounded by a uniform plasma. We obtain formulae for
the lensing angle and the magnification factors in this case and discuss a

a large homogeneous superfluid mixture of fermions in three and one dimensional
spaces. Bosons distort the density of surrounding fermions and create a
potential well where they can form a bound state analogous to a small polaron
state. In the three dimensional volume we observe the self-localization for
repulsive interactions between bosons and fermions. In the one dimensional case
bosons self-localize as well as for attractive interactions forming, together
with a pair of fermions at the bottom of the Fermi sea, a vector soliton. We
analyze also thermal effects and show that small non-zero temperature affects
the pairing function of the Fermi-subsystem and has little influence on the
self-localization phenomena.

uncertainties on the spectral parameters of the separated components. The
component separation errors are then propagated by means of Monte Carlo
simulations to obtain the corresponding contributions to uncertainties on the
component maps and on the CMB power spectra. For the Planck polarization case
they are found to be subdominant compared to noise.

factor to win the debate. The current value of that bias is a fixed external
parameter. It is a constant of the problem not given to change. In contrast,
stubbornness is an individual property. It results from external ingredients,
which are susceptible to be modified during the debate. More precisely, giving
some beliefs we determine the required stubbornness to oppose its associated
bias in the debate outcome. The results shed a new and counter intuitive light
on paradoxical outcomes of sensitive issues, which are discussed in the public.

galaxies is a complex combination of diffuse and point-like emission with
different spectral and spatial properties. We discuss the case of the Perseus
cluster containing the radio-galaxy NGC 1275 that has been detected as a bright
gamma-ray source by the Fermi-LAT experiment. We provide a detailed study of
the gamma-ray emission coming from the core of Perseus by modeling the central
AGN emission with a multiple plasma blob model, and the emission from the
cluster atmosphere with both a Warming Ray (WR) model and Dark Matter (DM)
neutralino annihilation models. We set constraints on both the central galaxy
and cluster SED models by using multi-frequency data including the observations
obtained by Fermi and MAGIC. We find that: i) in all the viable models for the
cluster gamma-ray emission, the emission detected by Fermi from the Perseus
core is dominated by the active galaxy NGC 1275, that is found in a
high-emission state; ii) the diffuse gamma-ray emission of the cluster, in the
WR model and in the DM models with the highest allowed normalization, could be
detected by Fermi if the central emission from NGC1275 is in a low-emission
state; iii) Fermi can have the possibility to resolve and detect the diffuse
gamma-ray flux coming from the outer corona of the Perseus atmosphere at r> 800
kpc. Our results show that a simultaneous study of the various emission
mechanisms that produce diffuse gamma-rays from galaxy clusters and those
producing gamma-rays from active galaxies residing in the cluster atmospheres
is crucial first to disentangle the spectral and spatial characteristics of the
gamma-ray emission and secondly to assess the optimal observational strategy in
the attempt to reveal the still elusive diffuse gamma-ray emission widely
predicted for the atmospheres of large-scale structures.

integrated in any theory like the SSM, certain special new composite
superfields arise. Spontaneous breaking of internal symmetry, like SU(2) X U(1)
to U(1), gives rise to a new realization of SUSY for these new superfields.
This realization mixes elementary and composite states. In the resulting
effective action, if the new superfield has mass, then there are SUSY
anomalies. Since there are no massless supermultiplets, the SUSY anomalies must
be present. They generate a spectrum for SUSY breaking that is consistent with
the known particles. Supergravity does not couple to the anomalies because it
does not couple to composite states. So unitarity is not violated. There is no
cosmological constant generated, because SUSY is not spontaneously broken.

data from WySH with infrared data from the Spitzer Wide-area Infrared

Explorer (GALEX) Deep Imaging Survey. This dataset provides a multi-wavelength
look at the evolution of the attenuation by dust, and here we compare a
traditional measure of dust attenuation (L(TIR)/L(FUV)) to a diagnostic based
on a recently-developed robust star formation rate (SFR) indicator,
[H-alpha_obs+24-micron]/H-alpha_obs. With such data over multiple epochs, the
evolution in the attenuation by dust with redshift can be assessed. We present
results from the ELAIS-N1 and Lockman Hole regions at z~0.16, 0.24, 0.32 and
0.40. While the ensemble averages of both diagnostics are relatively constant
from epoch to epoch, each epoch individually exhibits a larger attenuation by
dust for higher star formation rates. Hence, an epoch to epoch comparison at a
fixed star formation rate suggests a mild decrease in dust attenuation with
redshift.
