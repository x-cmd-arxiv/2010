representations are associated to automorphic forms. (Key examples in dimension
n>2 are the lifting theorems of Clozel, Harris and Taylor and of Geraghty.) All
present lifting theorems for n>2 dimensional representations have a certain
rather technical hypothesis---the residual image must be `big'. The aim of this
paper is to demystify this condition somewhat.
  For a fixed integer n, and a prime l larger than a constant depending on n,
we show that n dimensional mod l representations which fail to be big must be
of one of three kinds: they either fail to be absolutely irreducible, are
induced from representations of larger fields, or can be written as a tensor
product including a factor which is the reduction of an Artin representation in
characteristic zero. Hopefully this characterization will make the bigness
condition more comprehensible, at least for large l.

ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions are investigated at low transverse
momenta, $p_T\lsim 2$\,GeV. Utilizing empirical parameterizations of a
thermalized fireball with collective-flow fields, Resonance Recombination Model
(RRM) is employed to describe hadronization via quark coalescence at the
hadronization transition. We reconfirm that RRM converts equilibrium quark
distribution functions into equilibrated hadron spectra including the effects
of space-momentum correlations on elliptic flow. This provides the basis for a
controlled extraction of quark distributions of the bulk matter at
hadronization from spectra of multi-strange hadrons which are believed to
decouple close to the critical temperature. The resulting elliptic flow from
empirical fits at RHIC exhibits transverse kinetic-energy and valence-quark
scaling. Utilizing the well-established concept of sequential freeze-out we
find that the scaling at low momenta can be extended to bulk hadrons ($\pi$,
$K$, $p$) at thermal freeze-out, and thus result in an overall description
compatible with both equilibrium hydrodynamics and quark recombination.

Rigo on a Glivenko--Cantelli theorem for exchangeable inputs, we propose a new
paradigm, adequate for learning from exchangeable data: predictive PAC
learnability. A learning rule $\mathcal L$ for a function class $\mathscr F$ is
predictive PAC if for every $\e,\delta>0$ and each function $f\in {\mathscr
F}$, whenever $\abs{\sigma}\geq s(\delta,\e)$, we have with confidence
$1-\delta$ that the expected difference between $f(X_{n+1})$ and the image of

$X_1,X_2,\ldots,X_n$. Thus, instead of learning the function $f$ as such, we
are learning to a given accuracy $\e$ the predictive behaviour of $f$ at the
future points $X_i(\omega)$, $i>n$ of the sample path. Using de Finetti's
theorem, we show that if a universally separable function class $\mathscr F$ is
distribution-free PAC learnable under i.i.d. inputs, then it is
distribution-free predictive PAC learnable under exchangeable inputs, with a
slightly worse sample complexity.

infrared emission features detected in a wide variety of targets, remains
enigmatic. Here we focus on the group of young intermediate-mass Herbig Ae
stars. We have analyzed the aliphatic and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)
emission features in the infrared spectra of a sample of 53 Herbig Ae stars,
obtained with the Infrared Spectrograph aboard the Spitzer Space Telescope. We
confirm that the PAH-to-stellar luminosity ratio is higher in targets with a
flared dust disk. However, a few sources with a flattened dust disk still show
relatively strong PAH emission. Since PAH molecules trace the gas disk, this
indicates that gas disks may still be flared, while the dust disk has settled
due to grain growth. There are indications that the strength of the 11.3 um
feature also depends on dust disk structure, with flattened disks being less
bright in this feature. We confirm that the CC bond features at 6.2 and 7.8 um
shift to redder wavelengths with decreasing stellar effective temperature.
Moreover, we show that this redshift is accompanied by a relative increase of
aliphatic CH emission and a decrease of the aromatic 8.6 um CH feature
strength. Cool stars in our sample are surrounded by hydrocarbons with a high
aliphatic/aromatic CH ratio and a low aromatic CH/CC ratio, and vice versa for
the hot stars. We conclude that, while the overall hydrocarbon emission
strength depends on the dust disk's geometry, the relative differences seen in
the IR emission features in disks around Herbig Ae stars are mainly due to
chemical differences of the hydrocarbon molecules induced by the stellar UV
field. Strong UV flux reduces the aliphatic component and emphasizes the
spectral signature of the aromatic molecules in the IR spectra.

these processes only exist for finite time.

neutrality, governed by long range interactions between electrons. Perturbation
theory in a large number of flavors is used in which the interactions are
described within a random phase approximation, taking account of dynamical
screening effect. Crucially, the dynamically screened interaction retains some
long range character, resulting in $\log^2$ renormalization of key quantities.
We carry out the perturbative renormalization group calculations to one loop
order, and find that BLG behaves to leading order as a marginal Fermi liquid.
Interactions produce a log squared renormalization of the quasiparticle residue
and the interaction vertex function, while all other quantities renormalize
only logarithmically. We solve the RG flow equation for the Green function with
logarithmic accuracy, and find that the quasiparticle residue flows to zero
under RG. At the same time, the gauge invariant quantities, such as the
compressibility, remain finite to $\log^2$ order, with subleading logarithmic
corrections. The key experimental signature of this marginal Fermi liquid
behavior is a strong suppression of the tunneling density of states, which
manifests itself as a zero bias anomaly in tunneling experiments in a regime
where the compressibility is essentially unchanged from the non-interacting
value.

ii) the two-level kernel has an anomalous structure, which is characteristic of

decreasing $\lambda$ increases the anomaly. We also identify the two-level

the abundance ratios are in good agreement with the data. However, we find that
allowing a fraction of the metal-enriched material ejected by stars to be

except for two groups which are images of faithful representations of $C_8$ and
$C_3\rtimes C_8$ into $GL_4(\bm{Q})$ (both fixed fields for these two
exceptional cases are not rational over $\bm{Q}$). There are precisely 227 such

method used includes a high resolution fifth-order weighted essentially
non-oscillatory scheme for spatial discretization, coupled with a third order
total variation diminishing Runge-Kutta time stepping method. Two types of
disturbances are used for the initial perturbation. One is a random disturbance
which is imposed on the whole area of the detonation front, and the other is a
symmetrical disturbance imposed within a band along the diagonal direction on
the front. The results show that the two types of disturbances lead to
different processes. For the random disturbance, the detonation front evolves
into a stable spinning detonation. For the symmetrical diagonal disturbance,
the detonation front displays a diagonal pattern at an early stage, but this
pattern is unstable. It breaks down after a short while and it finally evolves
into a spinning detonation. The spinning detonation structure ultimately formed
due to the two types of disturbances is the same. This means that spinning
detonation is the most stable mode for the simulated narrow duct. Therefore, in
a narrow duct, triggering a spinning detonation can be an effective way to
produce a stable detonation as well as to speed up the deflagration to
detonation transition process.

requirements (compilers, libraries) and hard requirements like memory, storage

and soft requirements are met by a resource. In current scenario during
execution of a job, if a resource becomes unavailable, schedulers are presented
with limited options, namely re-queuing job or migrating job to a different

situations can be avoided, if the often ignored factor, availability time of a

kernel of digital signal processors. Because of the circuit complexity, the
power consumption and area are the two important design considerations of the
multiplier. In this paper a low power low area architecture for the shift and
add multiplier is proposed. For getting the low power low area architecture,
the modifications made to the conventional architecture consist of the
reduction in switching activities of the major blocks of the multiplier, which
includes the reduction in switching activity of the adder and counter. This
architecture avoids the shifting of the multiplier register. The simulation
result for 8 bit multipliers shows that the proposed low power architecture
lowers the total power consumption by 35.25% and area by 52.72 % when compared

which are reflected into the one-particle self-energy via the Schwinger-Dyson

Anderson model and the Hubbard model on a square lattice mainly for the

the Mermin-Wagner theorem. The present theory gives the same critical exponents

software measure that is attracting the software developers, designers and
researchers. In this paper a new interactions are defined for object oriented
system. Using these interactions, a parser is developed to analyze the existing
architecture of the software. Within the design model, it is necessary for
design classes to collaborate with one another. However, collaboration should
be kept to an acceptable minimum i.e. better designing practice will introduce
low coupling. If a design model is highly coupled, the system is difficult to
implement, to test and to maintain overtime. In case of enhancing software, we
need to introduce or remove module and in that case coupling is the most
important factor to be considered because unnecessary coupling may make the
system unstable and may cause reduction in the system's performance. So
coupling is thought to be a desirable goal in software construction, leading to
better values for external software qualities such as maintainability,
reusability and so on. To test this hypothesis, a good measure of class
coupling is needed. In this paper, based on the developed tool called Design
Analyzer we propose a methodology to reuse an existing system with the
objective of enhancing an existing Object oriented system keeping the coupling
as low as possible.

the research community in recent years. These networks have gained immense
popularity primarily due to their infrastructure-less mode of operation which
makes them a suitable candidate for deployment in emergency scenarios like
relief operation, battlefield etc., where either the pre-existing
infrastructure is totally damaged or it is not possible to establish a new
infrastructure quickly. However, MANETs are constrained due to the limited
transmission range of the mobile nodes which reduces the total coverage area.
Sometimes the infrastructure-less ad hoc network may be combined with a fixed
network to form a hybrid network which can cover a wider area with the
advantage of having less fixed infrastructure. In such a combined network, for
transferring data, we need base stations which act as gateways between the
wired and wireless domains. Due to the hybrid nature of these networks, routing
is considered a challenging task. Several routing protocols have been proposed
and tested under various traffic conditions. However, the simulations of such
routing protocols usually do not consider the hybrid network scenario. In this
work we have carried out a systematic performance study of the two prominent
routing protocols: Destination Sequenced Distance Vector Routing (DSDV) and
Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocols in the hybrid networking environment. We
have analyzed the performance differentials on the basis of three metrics -
packet delivery fraction, average end-to-end delay and normalized routing load
under varying pause time with different number of sources using NS2 based

into no joint 8 x 8 blocks and a two dimensional Discrete Cosine Transform (2-d

also performed on the secret messages/images before embedding and each bit of
Huffman code of secret message/image is embedded in the frequency domain by
altering the least significant bit of each of the DCT coefficients of cover

shows the better results in comparison with other existing steganography

reveals a strong nuclear point source and at least two fainter compact sources
embedded within a more luminous diffuse thermal component. Spectral fits to the
nuclear X-ray source imply an unabsorbed X-ray luminosity L_x >10^40 erg/s for
reasonable power law or blackbody models, consistent with accretion onto a >50
solar mass black hole behind a foreground absorbing column of N_H>10^23 /cm^2.
Two of these point sources have L_x=2-5 x 10^38 erg/s, comparable to luminous
X-ray binaries. These compact sources constitute a small fraction (<16%) of the
total X-ray flux from He~2-10 in the 0.3--6.0 keV band and just 31% of the
X-rays in the hard 1.1--6.0 keV band which is dominated by diffuse emission.
Two-temperature solar-composition plasmas (kT~0.2 keV and kT~0.7 keV) fit the
diffuse X-ray component as well as single-temperature plasmas with enhanced
alpha/Fe ratios. Since the observed radial gradient of the X-ray surface
brightness closely follows that of the Halpha emission, the composition of the
X-ray plasma likely reflects mixing of the ambient cool/warm ISM with an even
hotter, low emission measure plasma, thereby explaining the ~solar ISM
composition. Aperture synthesis 21-cm maps show an extended neutral medium to
radii of 60"" so that the warm and hot phases of the ISM, which extend to ~30"",
are enveloped within the 8x10^20 /cm^2 contour of the cool neutral medium. This
extended neutral halo may serve to inhibit a starburst-driven outflow unless it
is predominantly along the line of sight. The high areal density of star
formation can also be reconciled with the lack of prominent outflow signatures
if Henize 2-10 is in the very early stages of developing a galactic wind.

merely dispersed organisations in several network environments by using
computer based tools. Digital government must ensure security for its
information systems, including computers and networks for providing better
service to the citizens. Governments around the world are increasingly
revolving to information sharing and integration for solving problems in
programs and policy areas. Evils of global worry such as syndrome discovery and
manage, terror campaign, immigration and border control, prohibited drug
trafficking, and more demand information sharing, harmonization and cooperation
amid government agencies within a country and across national borders. A number
of daunting challenges survive to the progress of an efficient information
sharing protocol. A secure and trusted information-sharing protocol is required
to enable users to interact and share information easily and perfectly across
many diverse networks and databases globally.

in vacuum is attained in the differential forms formalism. This description is
explicitly invariant under diffeomorphisms of the spacetime so it is suitable
for arbitrary curvilinear coordinates. Moreover, it is independent of the
geometry of the underline spacetime. The bulk electric charge and current
densities are represented by twisted non-singular differential 3-forms. The
charge and current densities with a support on the low dimensional submanifolds
(surfaces, strings and points) naturally require singular differential forms.
In this paper, we present a covariant metric-free description of the surface,
string and point densities. It is shown that a covariant description requires
Dirac's delta-forms instead of delta-functions. Covariant metric-free
conservation laws for the low-dimensional densities are derived.

wave front formations are greatly enhanced by the presence of transverse waves.
The motion of transverse waves generates triple points (zones of high pressure
and large velocity coupled together), which cause the detonation front to
become locally overdriven and thus form ""hot spots"". The transversal motion of
these hot spots maintains the detonation to continuously occur along the whole
front in two and three-dimensions. The present simulations indicate that the
influence of the transverse waves on detonation is more profound in three

comprise only a few Jupiter-masses of gas and dust. Using millimetre surveys of
discs within six local star-formation regions, we confirm this result, and find
that only a few percent of young stars have enough circumstellar material to
build gas giant planets, in standard core accretion models. Since the frequency
of observed exo-planets is greater than this, there is a `missing mass'
problem. As alternatives to simply adjusting the conversion of dust-flux to
disc mass, we investigate three other classes of solution. Migration of planets
could hypothetically sweep up the disc mass reservoir more efficiently, but
trends in multi-planet systems do not support such a model, and theoretical
models suggest that the gas accretion timescale is too short for migration to
sweep the disc. Enhanced inner-disc mass reservoirs are possible, agreeing with
predictions of disc evolution through self-gravity, but not adding to
millimetre dust-flux as the inner disc is optically thick. Finally, the
incidence of massive discs is shown to be higher at the {\it proto}stellar
stages, Classes 0 and I, where discs substantial enough to form planets via
core accretion are abundant enough to match the frequency of exo-planets.
Gravitational instability may also operate in the Class 0 epoch, where half the
objects have potentially unstable discs of $\ga$30 % of the stellar mass.
However, recent calculations indicate that forming gas giants inside 50 AU by
instability is unlikely, even in such massive discs. Overall, the results
presented suggest that the canonically 'proto-planetary' discs of Class II T
Tauri stars {\bf have globally low masses in dust observable at millimetre
wavelengths, and conversion to larger bodies (anywhere from small rocks up to
planetary cores) must already have occurred.}

spontaneously formed, decay in several galactic rotations due to the increase
of stellar velocity dispersions. Therefore, some cooling mechanism, for example
dissipational effects of the interstellar medium, was assumed to be necessary
to keep the spiral arms. Here we show that stellar disks can maintain spiral
features for several tens of rotations without the help of cooling, using a
series of high-resolution three-dimensional $N$-body simulations of pure
stellar disks. We found that if the number of particles is sufficiently large,
e.g., $3\times 10^6$, multi-arm spirals developed in an isolated disk can
survive for more than 10 Gyrs. We confirmed that there is a self-regulating
mechanism that maintains the amplitude of the spiral arms. Spiral arms increase
Toomre's $Q$ of the disk, and the heating rate correlates with the squared
amplitude of the spirals. Since the amplitude itself is limited by the value of
$Q$, this makes the dynamical heating less effective in the later phase of
evolution. A simple analytical argument suggests that the heating is caused by
gravitational scattering of stars by spiral arms, and that the self-regulating
mechanism in pure-stellar disks can effectively maintain spiral arms on a
cosmological timescale. In the case of a smaller number of particles, e.g.,
$3\times 10^5$, spiral arms grow faster in the beginning of the simulation
(while $Q$ is small) and they cause a rapid increase of $Q$. As a result, the
spiral arms become faint in several Gyrs.

of the primary aims of the T2K experiment is to narrow down the current limit
on the value of theta13 (which if this value large enough, suggests CP
violation in the neutrino sector) and to find whether theta23 is maximal, which
is crucial for constraining neutrino mass models. T2K produces a high power
neutrino beam at the J-PARC facility on the east coast of Japan, and this beam
is then characterised by the near detector ND280 280 m from the start of the
beam, the far detector (Super-Kamiokande), a 50 kton water Cherenkov detector,
then detects the beam at the oscillation maximum of 295 km on Japan's west

appearance measurement - whose result will be sensitive to theta13 arguably the
main physics goal of T2K. The ND280 detector is imperative to this measurement

probability distribution function of Rx was functionally fitted as dependent on
the X-ray luminosity and redshift, P(Rx|Lx,z). It roughly spans over 6 decades
(-7<Rx<-1), and does not show any sign of bi-modality. It resulted that the
probability of finding large values of the Rx ratio increases with decreasing
X-ray luminosities and (possibly) with increasing redshift. No statistical
significant difference was found between the radio properties of the X-ray
absorbed and unabsorbed AGN. The measure of the probability distribution
function of Rx allowed us to compute the kinetic luminosity function and the
kinetic energy density which, at variance with what assumed in many galaxy
evolution models, is observed to decrease of about a factor of five at redshift
below 0.5. About half of the kinetic energy density results to be produced by
the more radio quiet (Rx<-4) AGN. In agreement with previous estimates, the AGN

geometrization in the last twenty years. These papers develop a new direction
of the microcosm physics. It is so-called geometric paradigm, which is
alternative to the quantum paradigm, which is conventionally used now. The
hypothesis on discreteness of the space-time geometry appears to be more
fundamental, than the hypothesis on quantum nature of microcosm. Discrete
space-time geometry admits one to describe quantum effects as pure geometric
effects. Mathematical technique of the microcosm physics geometrization
(geometric paradigm) is based on the physical geometry, which is described
completely by the world function. Equations, describing motion of particles in
the microcosm, are algebraic (not differential) equations. They are written in
a coordinateless form in terms of world function. The geometric paradigm
appeared as a result of overcoming of inconsistency of the conventional
elementary particle theory. In the suggested skeleton conception the state of
an elementary particle is described by its skeleton (several space-time
points). The skeleton contains all information on the particle properties
(mass, charge, spin, etc.). The skeleton conception is a monistic construction,
where elementary particle motion is described in terms of skeleton and world
function and only in these terms. The skeleton conception can be constructed
only on the basis of the physical geometry. Unfortunately, most mathematicians
do not accept the physical geometries, because these geometries are
nonaxiomatizable. It is a repetition of the case, when mathematicians did not
accept the non-Euclidean geometries of Lobachevsky-Bolyai. As a result this
review is a review of papers of one author.

Although the WMAP beam profile core is only 12.6arcmin FWHM at W, there is a
long power-law tail to the beam due to side-lobes and this causes significant
effects even at the first peak position. We then test the form of the
beam-profile used by the WMAP team which is based on observations of Jupiter.
We stacked radio source beam profiles as observed in each WMAP band and found
that they showed a wider profile in Q, V, W than the Jupiter profile. We have
now checked that this is not due to any Eddington or other bias in our sample
by showing that the same results are obtained when radio sources are selected
at 1.4GHz and that our methods retrieve the Jupiter beam when it is employed in
simulations. Finally, we show that the uncertainty in the WMAP beam profile
allows the position as well as the amplitude of the first peak to be changed

towards the Vela-Puppis constellations, and within the core of the Canis Major

color-color and color-magnitude diagrams, derived from deep $UBV$ photometry.
The existence of young star aggregates at such extreme distances from the
Galactic center challenges the commonly accepted scenario in which the Galactic
disc has a sharp cut-off at about 14 kpc from the Galactic center, and
indicates that it extends to much greater distances (as also supported by
recent detection of CO molecular complexes well beyond this distance). While
the groups we find in the area of Ruprecht~30 are compatible with the Orion and
Norma-Cygnus spiral arms, respectively, the distant group we identify in the

determine age, bolometric luminosities, masses and the extinction, by comparing
the multi-band integrated photometry to single-age stellar population models.
The stellar system ages range between 2 and 15 Myr, masses are between 3 x 10^2
and 4 x 10^4 M_sun, and the intrinsic extinction, A_V, varies from 0.3 to 1
mag. We find a correlation between age and extinction, and between the cluster
mass and size. The MIR emission shows the presence of a dust component around
the clusters whose fractional luminosity at 24 um, L_{24}/L_{Bol}, decreases
with the galactocentric distance. However, the total IR luminosity inferred
from L_{24} is smaller than what we derive from the extinction corrections. The
Halpha luminosity predicted by population synthesis models is larger than the
observed one, especially for low-mass systems (M < 10^4 M_sun). Such a
difference is reduced, but not erased, when the incomplete sampling of the
initial mass function (IMF) at the high-mass end is taken into account. Our
results suggest that a non-negligible fraction of UV ionising and non-ionising
radiation is leaking into the ISM outside the HII regions. This would be in
agreement with the large UV and Halpha diffuse fractions observed in M33, but
it implies that stellar systems younger than 3 Myr retain, on average, only 30%
of their Lyman continuum photons. However, the uncertainties on cluster ages
and the stochastic fluctuations of the IMF do not allow to accurately quantify
this issue. We also consider the possibility that this discrepancy is the
consequence of a suppressed or delayed formation of the most massive stars.
