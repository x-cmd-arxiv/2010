Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination. The SRH formalism expresses the dark
current in terms of carrier recombination through mid-gap traps. The SRH
recombination rate depends on the electron and hole densities of states (DOS)
in the barriers and wells, which are well known, and of carrier non-radiative
lifetimes. These material quality dependent lifetimes are extracted from
analysis of suitable bulk control samples. Consistency over a range of AlGaAs
controls and QWSCs is examined, and the model is applied to QWSCs in InGaAsP on
InP substrates. We find that the dark currents of MQW systems require a
reduction of the quasi Fermi level separation between carrier populations in
the wells relative to barrier material, in line with previous studies.

SLE(4)-type curves was discovered by O. Schramm and S. Sheffield. A weak
interpretation of this relation is the existence of a coupling of the GFF and a
random curve, in which the curve behaves like a level line of the field. In the
present paper we study these couplings for the free field with different
boundary conditions. We provide a unified way to determine the law of the curve
(i.e. to compute the driving process of the Loewner chain) given boundary
conditions of the field, and to prove existence of the coupling. The proof is
reduced to the verification of two simple properties of the mean and covariance
of the field, which always relies on Hadamard's formula and properties of
harmonic functions.
  Examples include combinations of Dirichlet, Neumann and Riemann-Hilbert
boundary conditions. In doubly connected domains, the standard annulus SLE(4)
is coupled with a compactified GFF obeying Neumann boundary conditions on the
inner boundary. We also consider variants of annulus SLE coupled with free
fields having other natural boundary conditions. These include boundary
conditions leading to curves connecting two points on different boundary
components with prescribed winding as well as those recently proposed by C.

transfer results from the exclusion of complete energy exchange between

to that turns out to be twice more than threshold of zone boundary mode's
instability. To obtain this result one needs in far going extension of the
beating concept to a wide class of finite oscillatory chains. In turn, such an
extension leads to description of energy exchange and transition to energy
localization and transfer in terms of 'effective particles' and Limiting Phase
Trajectories. The 'effective particles' appear naturally when the frequency
spectrum crowding ensures the resonance interaction between zone boundary and
two nearby nonlinear normal modes, but there are no additional resonances. We
show that the Limiting Phase Trajectories corresponding to the most intensive

alternative to Nonlinear Normal Modes, which describe the stationary process.

is developed. The algorithm works directly on the transaction data and updates
the volatility estimate immediately after the occurrence of a new transaction.
Furthermore, a nonlinear market microstructure noise model is proposed that
reproduces several stylized facts of high-frequency data. A computationally
efficient particle filter is used that allows for the approximation of the
unknown efficient prices and, in combination with a recursive EM algorithm, for
the estimation of the volatility curve. We neither assume that the transaction
times are equidistant nor do we use interpolated prices. We also make a
distinction between volatility per time unit and volatility per transaction and
provide estimators for both. More precisely we use a model with random time
change where spot volatility is decomposed into spot volatility per transaction

accretion tends to spin superspinars down) imply that superspinars are very

main aim is to trace the warm gas chemically enriched by the passage of a shock
and to infer the excitation conditions in L1157-B1. A total of 27 lines are
identified in the 555-636 GHz region, down to an average 3 sigma level of 30
mK. The emission is dominated by CO(5-4) and H2O(110-101) transitions, as
discussed by Lefloch et al. (2010). Here we report on the identification of
lines from NH3, H2CO, CH3OH, CS, HCN, and HCO+. The comparison between the
profiles produced by molecules released from dust mantles (NH3, H2CO, CH3OH)
and that of H2O is consistent with a scenario in which water is also formed in
the gas-phase in high-temperature regions where sputtering or grain-grain

aggregation rate at which the dissolved protein converts into aggregates. In
this study, the correlation between the lag time and the maximal rate of
protein aggregation is analyzed. It is found that the product of these two
quantities depends on a single numerical parameter, the kinetic index of the
curve quantifying the time evolution of the fraction of protein aggregated. As
this index depends relatively little on the conditions and/or system studied,
our finding provides insight into why for many experiments the values of the

from collisionless effects. Three main results are described. There exists a
regime in which secondary islands occur without collisionless effects when the
thickness of the dissipation regions exceed ion gyroscales. The reconnection
rate with secondary islands is faster than Sweet-Parker but significantly
slower than Hall reconnection. This implies that secondary islands are not the

faster, its onset causes the ejection of secondary islands from the vicinity of
the X-line. These results imply that most of the energy release occurs during
Hall reconnection. Coronal applications are discussed.

characterizing the $s$-channel resonant annihilation process in great detail,
keeping track of all velocity-dependence, the presence of multiple scales and
treating each physical regime above, below, and close to thresholds separately.
The resonant regime as well as extension to include non-resonant processes are
then reduced to analytic formulas and inequalities that describe the full range
of multi-dimensional numerical work. These results eliminate the need to
recompute relic abundance model by model, and reduce calculations to verifying
certain scale and parameter combinations are consistent. Remarkably simple
formulas describe the relation between the total width of an $s$-channel
intermediate particle, the masses and the couplings involved. Eliminating the
width in terms of the mass produces new consistency relations between dark
matter masses and the intermediate masses. The formulas are general enough to
test directly whether new particles can be identified as dark matter. Resonance
mass and total width are quantities directly observable at accelerators such as
the LHC, and will be sufficient to establish whether new discoveries are
consistent with the cosmological bounds on dark matter.

goes to infinity, the fluid becomes incompressible and the Navier-Stokes

simulations include star formation, 3D radiative transfer, and a highly
detailed ISM model, and reach spatial resolution sufficient to resolve
formation sites for molecular clouds. In the simulations the local radiation
field in the Lyman-Werner band around star-forming molecular clouds dominates
over the cosmic UV background by a factor of 100, similarly to the interstellar
radiation field in the Milky Way and in a few high redshift galaxies for which
measurements exist. The cosmic UV background, therefore, is essentially
irrelevant for star formation in normal galaxies.

to be unstable by Emparan and Myers. In a previous publication, we found
numerically the onset of the axisymmetric ultraspinning instability in the
singly-spinning Myers-Perry black hole in d=7,8,9. This threshold signals also
a bifurcation to new branches of axisymmetric solutions with pinched horizons
that are conjectured to connect to the black ring, black Saturn and other
families in the phase diagram of stationary solutions. We firmly establish that
this instability is also present in d=6 and in d=10,11. The boundary conditions
of the perturbations are discussed in detail for the first time and we prove
that they preserve the angular velocity and temperature of the original
Myers-Perry black hole. This property is fundamental to establish a
thermodynamic necessary condition for the existence of this instability in
general rotating backgrounds. We also prove a previous claim that the
ultraspinning modes cannot be pure gauge modes. Finally we find new
ultraspinning Gregory-Laflamme instabilities of rotating black strings and
branes that appear exactly at the critical rotation predicted by the
aforementioned thermodynamic criterium. The latter is a refinement of the
Gubser-Mitra conjecture.

long outbursts during 2008, separated by 30 d in quiescence. Such a short
quiescent period between outbursts has never been seen before from a neutron
star X-ray transient. X-ray pulsations at the 599 Hz spin frequency are
detected throughout both outbursts. For the first time, we derive a pulse phase
model that connects two outbursts, providing a long baseline for spin frequency
measurement. Comparison with the frequency measured during the 2004 outburst of
this source gives a spin-down during quiescence of -4(1)x10^-15 Hz/s,
approximately an order of magnitude larger than the long-term spin-down
observed in the 401 Hz accretion-powered pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658. If this
spin-down is due to magnetic dipole radiation, it requires a 2x10^8 G field
strength, and its high spin-down luminosity may be detectable with the Fermi
Large Area Telescope. Alternatively, this large spin-down could be produced by
gravitational wave emission from a fractional mass quadrupole moment of Q/I =
1x10^{-9}. The rapid succession of the outbursts also provides a unique test of
models for accretion in low-mass X-ray binaries. Disk instability models
generally predict that an outburst will leave the accretion disk too depleted
to fuel a second outburst after such a brief quiescence. We suggest a
modification in which the outburst is shut off by the onset of a propeller
effect before the disk is depleted. This model can explain the short quiescence
and the unusually slow rise of the light curve of the second 2008 outburst.

empirically that the partially or fully adapted particle filters can be much
more efficient than the standard particle, especially when the signal to noise
ratio is high. This is especially important because using the particle filter
within MCMC sampling is O(T^2), where T is the sample size. We also show that
an adaptive independent proposal for the unknown parameters based on a mixture
of normals can be much more efficient than the usual optimal random walk
methods because the simulated likelihood is not continuous in the parameters
and the cost of constructing a good adaptive proposal is negligible compared to
the cost of evaluating the simulated likelihood. Independent \MH proposals are
also attractive because they are easy to run in parallel on multiple
processors. The article also shows that the proposed \aimh sampler converges to
the posterior distribution. We also show that the marginal likelihood of any
state space model can be obtained in an efficient and unbiased manner by using
the \pf making model comparison straightforward. Obtaining the marginal
likelihood is often difficult using other methods. Finally, we prove that the
simulated likelihood obtained by the auxiliary particle filter is unbiased.

decades from the approximation algorithms community, concentrating primarily on
improving the approximation guarantees. In this paper, we ask, is it possible
to parallelize some of the beautiful results from the sequential setting?
  Our starting point is a small, but diverse, subset of results in
approximation algorithms for facility-location problems, with a primary goal of
developing techniques for devising their efficient parallel counterparts. We
focus on giving algorithms with low depth, near work efficiency (compared to
the sequential versions), and low cache complexity. Common in algorithms we
present is the idea that instead of picking only the most cost-effective
element, we make room for parallelism by allowing a small slack (e.g., a
$(1+\vareps)$ factor) in what can be selected---then, we use a clean-up step to
ensure that the behavior does not deviate too much from the sequential steps.
All the algorithms we developed are ``cache efficient'' in that the cache
complexity is bounded by $O(w/B)$, where $w$ is the work in the EREW model and
$B$ is the block size.

(i) The simple waving motion of an elongated flexible ribbon plate of constant
width, immersed in a fluid at rest, propagating a wave distally down the plate
to swim forward is first considered to provide a fundamental concept on energy
conservation. It is generalized to include variations in body width and
thickness, vortex shedding from appended dorsal, ventral and caudal fins to
closely simulate fish swimming for which a nonlinear theory is presented for
large-amplitude propulsion. (ii) For bird flight, the pioneering studies on
oscillating rigid wings are briefed, followed by presenting a nonlinear
unsteady theory for flexible wing with arbitrary variations in shape and
trajectory with a comparative study with experiments. (iii) For insect flight,
more recent advances are reviewed under aerodynamic theory and modeling,
computational methods, and experiments, on forward and hovering flights with
producing leading-edge vortex to give unsteady high lift. (iv) Prospects are
explored on extracting intrinsic flow energy by fish and bird to gain thrust
for propulsion. (v) The mechanical and biological principles are drawn together
for unified studies on the energetics in deriving metabolic power for animal
locomotion, leading to a surprising discovery that the hydrodynamic viscous
drag on swimming fish is largely associated with laminar boundary layers, thus
drawing valid and sound evidences for a resolution to the fish-swim paradox

$\gamma$, describing, respectively, the intermittence and singularity of the

flux of quasars from $z=4.9$ to $z=6.3$ can be well reconstructed by the
hydrodynamical simulation samples. Although the Gunn-Peterson optical depth and
its variance underwent a significant evolution in the redshift range of $5 -
6$, the intermittency measured by $\beta$ is almost redshift-independent in
this range. More interesting, the intermittency of quasar's absorption spectra
on physical scales $0.1-1$ h$^{-1}$Mpc in redshift $5 - 6$ are found to be
about the same as that on physical scales $1-10$ h$^{-1}$Mpc at redshifts $2 -

$1$ h$^{-1}$Mpc at $z\sim 2$, these results imply that the nonlinear evolution
in high and low redshifts will lead the cosmic baryon fluid to a state similar
to fully developed turbulence. The log-Poisson high order behavior of current
high redshift data of quasar's spectrum can be explained by uniform UV
background in the redshift range considered. We also studied the log-Poisson
non-Gaussianity by considering inhomogeneous background. With several
simplified models of inhomogeneous background, we found the effect of the

thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) power spectrum due to astrophysical
uncertainties in the thermal structure of the intracluster medium. Our model
accounts for star formation and energy feedback (from supernovae and active
galactic nuclei) as well as radially dependent non-thermal pressure support due
to random gas motions, the latter calibrated by recent hydrodynamical
simulations. We compare the model against X-ray observations of low redshift
clusters, finding excellent agreement with observed pressure profiles. Varying
the levels of feedback and non-thermal pressure support can significantly
change both the amplitude and shape of the thermal SZ power spectrum.
Increasing the feedback suppresses power at small angular scales, shifting the
peak of the power spectrum to lower ell. On the other hand, increasing the
non-thermal pressure support has the opposite effect, significantly reducing
power at large angular scales. In general, including non-thermal pressure at
the level measured in simulations has a large effect on the power spectrum,
reducing the amplitude by 50% at angular scales of a few arcminutes compared to
a model without a non-thermal component. Our results demonstrate that
measurements of the shape of the power spectrum can reveal useful information

broadband colors of the interacting spiral system M51/NGC 5195, we have
conducted a photometric study of the stellar associations across the entire
disk of the galaxy in order to assess trends in size, luminosity, and local
environment associated with recent star formation activity in the system.
Starting with a sample of over 900 potential associations, we have produced
color-magnitude and color-color diagrams for the 120 associations that were
deemed to be single-aged. It has been found that main sequence turnoffs are not
evident for the vast majority of the stellar associations in our set,
potentially due to the overlap of isochronal tracks at the high mass end of the
main sequence, and the limited depth of our images at the distance of M51. In
order to obtain ages for more of our sample, we produced model spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) to fit to the data from the GALEXEV simple stellar
population (SSP) models of Bruzual and Charlot (2003). These SEDs can be used
to determine age, size, mass, metallicity, and dust content of each association
via a simple chi-squared minimization to each association's B, V, and I-band
fluxes. The derived association properties are mapped as a function of
location, and recent trends in star formation history of the galaxy are
explored in light of these results. This work is the first phase in a program
that will compare these stellar systems with their environments using
ultraviolet data from GALEX and infrared data from Spitzer, and ultimately we
plan to apply the same stellar population mapping methodology to other nearby
face-on spiral galaxies.

mobile nodes without any centralized access point or infrastructure to
coordinate among the peers. The underlying concept of coordination among nodes
in a cooperative MANET has induced in them a vulnerability to attacks due to
issues like lack of fixed infrastructure, dynamically changing network
topology, cooperative algorithms, lack of centralized monitoring and management
point, and lack of a clear line of defense. We propose a semi-distributed
approach towards Reputation Based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that
combines with the DSR routing protocol for strengthening the defense of a
MANET. Our system inherits the features of reputation from human behavior,
hence making the IDS socially inspired. It has a semi-distributed architecture
as the critical observation results of the system are neither spread globally
nor restricted locally. The system assigns maximum weightage to self
observation by nodes for updating any reputation values, thus avoiding the need
of a trust relationship between nodes. Our system is also unique in the sense
that it features the concepts of Redemption and Fading with a robust Path
Manager and Monitor system. Simulation studies show that DSR fortified with our
system outperforms normal DSR in terms of the packet delivery ratio and routing
overhead even when up to half of nodes in the network behave as malicious.
Various parameters introduced such as timing window size, reputation update
values, congestion parameter and other thresholds have been optimized over
several simulation test runs of the system. By combining the semi-distributed
architecture and other design essentials like path manager, monitor module,
redemption and fading concepts; Our system proves to be robust enough to
counter most common attacks in MANETs.

spheres with arbitrary sizes and dimensions. Such manifolds are known to be
non-negatively cross-curved [KM2]. Under boundedness and non-vanishing
assumptions on the transfered source and target densities we show that optimal
maps stay away from the cut-locus (where the cost exhibits singularity), and
obtain injectivity and continuity of optimal maps. This together with the
result of Liu, Trudinger and Wang [LTW] also implies higher regularity
(C^{1,\alpha}/C^\infty) of optimal maps for more smooth (C^\alpha /C^\infty))
densities. These are the first global regularity results which we are aware of
concerning optimal maps on non-flat Riemannian manifolds which possess some
vanishing sectional curvatures. Moreover, such product manifolds have potential
relevance in statistics (see [S]) and in statistical mechanics (where the state
of a system consisting of many spins is classically modeled by a point in the
phase space obtained by taking many products of spheres). For the proof we
apply and extend the method developed in [FKM1], where we showed injectivity
and continuity of optimal maps on domains in R^n for smooth non-negatively
cross-curved cost. The major obstacle in the present paper is to deal with the
non-trivial cut-locus and the presence of flat directions.

a range of pT extending from 0.2 GeV/c to 5 GeV/c. The center of mass energy

shows that highly nonlinear microstructure fiber has the lowest Raman noise
photon generation rate among the three types of fibers while correlated photon
pair generation rate is the same. Theoretical analysis shows that the noise
performance is determined by the nonlinear index and Raman response of the
material in fiber core. The Raman response raises with increasing doping level,
however, the nonlinear index is almost unchanged with it. As a result, highly

  arXiv:1001.3571",,,,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  How many fraction of gas available at the outer boundary can finally fall
onto the black hole is an important question. It determines the observational
appearance of accretion flows, and is also related with the evolution of black
hole mass and spin. Previous two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of hot
accretion flows find that the flow is convectively unstable because of its
inward increase of entropy. As a result, the mass accretion rate decreases
inward, i.e., only a small fraction of accretion gas can fall onto the black
hole, while the rest circulates in the convective eddies or lost in convective
outflows. Radiation is usually neglected in these simulations. In many cases,
however, radiative cooling is important. In the regime of the luminous hot
accretion flow (LHAF), radiative cooling is even stronger than the viscous
dissipation. In the one dimensional case, this implies that the inward increase
of entropy will become slower or the entropy even decreases inward in the case
of an LHAF. We therefore expect that convective instability becomes weaker or
completely disappears when radiative cooling is important. To examine the
validity of this expectation, in this paper we perform two-dimensional
hydrodynamical simulations of hot accretion flows with strong radiative
cooling. We find that compared to the case of negligible radiation, convection
only becomes slightly weaker. Even an LHAF is still strongly convectively
unstable, its radial profile of accretion rate correspondingly changes little.
We find the reason is that the entropy still increases inward in the
two-dimensional case.

comparing the variance of the probability distribution of the quantum walk in

observations of 14 Seyfert galaxies observed by XMM-Newton, which exhibit
sufficient variability and signal-to-noise ratio to examine the variations in
the iron K-band. The narrow core of the K alpha line at 6.4 keV, seen
universally in Seyferts, shows minimal evidence for variability and is always
less variable than the continuum, supporting an origin in distant material such
as the torus. At least half the observations do show evidence for variations in
the wider iron K-band, however, and in at least 5 cases the excess line
variations appear to be broad. The simplest prediction -- that the broad
emission line is as variable as the continuum -- is generally not confirmed as
only two observations show this type of behaviour. In four cases, the red wing
of the line is more variable than the power-law continuum and extends down to
energies of ~ 5 keV. Three observations show strong variability blueward of the
line core that could also be from the disk, but alternatively might be due to
emission or absorption by other hot or photoionised gas close to the nucleus.
In cases where this excess blue variability is present, it is not always seen
in the time-averaged spectrum. Six observations possess a broad iron line in
the time-averaged spectra but with an invariant red wing, and three of these
six show no variability across the entire iron line region. This suggests a
decoupling of the continuum and reflection component, perhaps due to light
bending or other anisotropic effects as has been suggested for MCG-6-30-15 and
other narrow-line Seyfert 1s. A key result is that the rms spectra of objects
such as NGC 3516 do not agree with complex absorption effects mimicking the
broad red wing.

relaxation was determined by the Suhl-Nakamura interaction at low temperatures

approaches $T_s$. This indicates that the fluctuation of the spiral component
becomes faster as the temperature increases but not fast enough to leave an
averaged hyperfine field to nuclei in the time scale of nuclear spin precession
in the ferrimagnetic phase, which is on the order of $10^{-8}$ s. The spiral
volume fraction measured for various temperatures reveals that the collinear

that this transition has first-order characteristics.

that the detection used in [1] is sensitive to emitted photons and not to the

supposing that the detection simply takes the square of the voltage, i.e. is
sensitive to vacuum fluctuations, leads to identical results. We demonstrate
that all the results can be explained in terms of usual gaussian voltage
fluctuations instead of photon statistics. Finally, it is found in [1] that the
photon noise is gaussian for a tunnel junction, for which the electron counting
statistics is poissonian. We show that this result is beyond the experimental

consequent difference in polarization affects detection statistics and
parameter estimation. To astrophysically interpret a detection or upper limit
it is necessary to convert the wave amplitude to an r-mode amplitude. Also, it
is helpful to know indirect limits on gravitational-wave emission to gauge the
interest of various searches. Here I address these issues, thereby providing
the ingredients to adapt broad-band searches for continuous gravitational waves
to obtain r-mode results. I also show that searches of existing data can

covering the ultraviolet to visible rest-frame spectral range, we analyze the
spectral differences observed in the P Cygni-type line profiles and have used
the microlensing effect to derive new clues to the BAL profile formation. We
confirm that the spectral differences observed in component D can be attributed
to a microlensing effect lasting at least a decade. We show that microlensing
magnifies the continuum source in image D, leaving the emission line region
essentially unaffected. We interpret the differences seen in the absorption
profiles of component D as the result of an emission line superimposed onto a
nearly black absorption profile. We also find that the continuum source and a
part of the broad emission line region are likely de-magnified in component C,
while components A and B are not affected by microlensing. We show that
microlensing of the continuum source in component D has a chromatic dependence
compatible with the thermal continuum emission of a standard Shakura-Sunyaev
accretion disk. Using a simple decomposition method to separate the part of the
line profiles affected by microlensing and coming from a compact region from
the part unaffected by this effect and coming from a larger region, we
disentangle the true absorption line profiles from the true emission line
profiles. The extracted emission line profiles appear double-peaked, suggesting
that the emission is occulted by a strong absorber, narrower in velocity than
the full absorption profile, and emitting little by itself. We propose that the
outflow around H1413+117 is constituted by a high-velocity polar flow and a
denser, lower velocity disk seen nearly edge-on.

modulation and differential pulse-code modulation. Specifically, two source
prediction loops, one for each description, are embedded within a common noise
shaping loop, whose parameters are explicitly found from the spectral-domain

multi-epoch (12 visits), 690 square degree radio image and catalog at 1.4GHz.
The survey is designed to detect rare, very bright transients as well as to
verify the capabilities of the ATA to form large mosaics. The combined image
using data from all 12 ATATS epochs has RMS noise sigma = 3.94mJy / beam and
dynamic range 180, with a circular beam of 150 arcsec FWHM. It contains 4408
sources to a limiting sensitivity of S = 20 mJy / beam. We compare the catalog
generated from this 12-epoch combined image to the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS),
a legacy survey at the same frequency, and find that we can measure source
positions to better than ~20 arcsec. For sources above the ATATS completeness
limit, the median flux density is 97% of the median value for matched NVSS
sources, indicative of an accurate overall flux calibration. We examine the
effects of source confusion due to the effects of differing resolution between
ATATS and NVSS on our ability to compare flux densities. We detect no
transients at flux densities greater than 40 mJy in comparison with NVSS, and
place a 2-sigma upper limit on the transient rate for such sources of 0.004 per
square degree. These results suggest that the > 1 Jy transients reported by
Matsumura et al. (2009) may not be true transients, but rather variable sources
at their flux density threshold.

in a severe performance discrepancy between different nodes in the uplink,
depending on their position. Both throughput and energy expense are affected.
Cooperative protocols were proposed to mitigate these discrepancies. However,
additional network state information (NSI) from other nodes is needed to enable
cooperation. The aim of this work is to assess how NSI and the degree of
cooperation affect throughput and energy expenses. To this end, a CSMA protocol
called fairMAC is defined, which allows to adjust the amount of NSI at the
nodes and the degree of cooperation among the nodes in a distributed manner. By
analyzing the data obtained by Monte Carlo simulations with varying protocol
parameters for fairMAC, two fundamental tradeoffs are identified: First, more
cooperation leads to higher throughput, but also increases energy expenses.
Second, using more than one helper increases throughput and decreases energy
expenses, however, more NSI has to be acquired by the nodes in the network. The
obtained insights are used to increase the lifetime of a network. While full
cooperation shortens the lifetime compared to no cooperation at all, lifetime
can be increased by over 25% with partial cooperation.

dependent enhancement of its elastic modulus as well as its characteristic

aging decreases and in the limit of high stress, the aging stops with the

the aging that occurs over short creep times at small normal stresses is same
as the aging that occurs over long creep times at large normal stresses. This
observation allows us to suggest an aging time - process time - normal stress

counterterms are required in each case and determine their coefficients to one

axial-vector currents for Karsten-Wilczek fermions. Like in the case of the

errors of sources when compared to source positions in the Molonglo Reference
Catalogue (MRC). We have applied two-dimensional homography to correct for
systematic positional errors in the image domain and thereby avoid
re-processing the visibility data. Positions of bright (above 15-{\sigma})
point sources, common to MRT catalogue and MRC, are used to set up an
over-determined system to solve for the homography matrix. After correction the
errors are found to be within 10% of the beamwidth for these bright sources and
the systematics are eliminated from the images. This technique will be of
relevance to the new generation radio telescopes where, owing to huge data
rates, only images after a certain integration would be recorded as opposed to
raw visibilities. It is also interesting to note how our investigations cued to
possible errors in the array geometry. The analysis of positional errors of
sources showed that MRT images are stretched in declination by ~1 part in 1000.
This translates to a compression of the baseline scale in the visibility
domain. The array geometry was re-estimated using the astrometry principle. The
estimates show an error of ~1 mm/m, which results in an error of about half a
wavelength at 150 MHz for a 1 km north-south baseline. The estimates also

methods for characterizing the topology and sizes of HII regions during

ionized regions. Three of them give us a full size distribution: the
friends-of-friends (FOF) method, the spherical average method (SPA) and the
power spectrum (PS) of the ionized fraction. These latter three methods are
complementary: While the FOF method captures the size distribution of the small
scale H II regions, which contribute only a small amount to the total
ionization fraction, the spherical average method provides a smoothed measure
for the average size of the H II regions constituting the main contribution to
the ionized fraction, and the power spectrum does the same while retaining more
details on the size distribution. Our fourth method for characterizing the
sizes of the H II regions is the average size which results if we divide the
total volume of the H II regions by their total surface area, (i.e. 3V/A),
computed in terms of the ratio of the corresponding Minkowski functionals of
the ionized fraction field. To characterize the topology of the ionized
regions, we calculate the evolution of the Euler Characteristic. We find that
the evolution of the topology during the first half of reionization is
consistent with inside-out reionization of a Gaussian density field. We use
these techniques to investigate the dependence of size and topology on some
basic source properties, such as the halo mass-to-light ratio, susceptibility
of haloes to negative feedback from reionization, and the minimum halo mass for
sources to form. We find that suppression of ionizing sources within ionized
regions slows the growth of H II regions, and also changes their size
distribution. Additionally, the topology of simulations including suppression
is more complex. (abridged)

formation rate (SFR) within spiral arms of the nearby late-type spiral galaxies

the Far-Infrared Surveyor (FIS) aboard AKARI in four far-infrared bands at 65,
90, 140, and 160 um. The spectral energy distributions of the whole galaxies
show the presence of the cold dust component (Tc~20 K) in addition to the warm
dust component (Tw~60 K). We deconvolved the cold and warm dust emission
components spatially by making the best use of the multi-band photometric
capability of the FIS. The cold and warm dust components show power-law
correlations in various regions, which can be converted into the gas mass and
the SFR, respectively. We find a power-law correlation between the gas and SFR
surface densities with significant differences in the power law index N between
giant HII regions (N=1.0) and spiral arms (N=2.2) in M101. The power-law index
for spiral arms in M81 is similar (N=1.9) to that of spiral arms in M101.
Conclusions: The power-law index is not always constant within a galaxy. The
difference in the power-law index can be attributed to the difference in the
star formation processes on a kiloparsec scale. N~2 seen in the spiral arms in
M81 and M101 supports the scenario of star formation triggered by cloud-cloud
collisions enhanced by spiral density wave, while N~1 derived in giant HII
regions in M101 suggests the star formation induced by the Parker instability
triggered by high velocity HI gas infall. The present method can be applied to
a large galaxy sample for which the AKARI All Sky Survey provides the same 4

of an experiment funded by the INFN Vth Committee dedicated to beam
diagnostics, the device with its electronic board has been tested and installed
on the DA{\Phi}NE positron ring. A preliminary characterization of few pixels
of the array and of the electronics has been carried out at the IR beamline
SINBAD at DA{\Phi}NE. In particular the detection of the IR source of the e-
beam has been observed using four pixels of the array acquiring signals
simultaneously with a four channels scope at 1 GHz and at 10 Gsamples/s. The
acquisition of four pixels allowed monitoring in real time differences in the
bunch signals in the vertical direction. A preliminary analysis of data is
presented and discussed. In particular we will outline the correlation between
signals and displacements of the source occurring with bunch refilling during a
complete shift of DA{\Phi}NE.

anticorrelations for 50--70% of the investigated samples in the cluster 47 Tuc,
otherwise considered a ""normal"" prototype of high metallicity clusters from the
photometric analysis. Very recently, the re-analysis of a large number of
archival HST data of the cluster core has been able to put into evidence the
presence of structures in the Sub Giant Branch: it has a brighter component
with a spread in magnitude by $\sim$0.06 mag and a second one, made of about
10% of stars, a little fainter (by $\sim$0.05 mag). These data also show that
the Main Sequence of the cluster has an intrinsic spread in color which, if
interpreted as due to a small spread in helium abundance, suggests
$\Delta$Y$\sim$0.027. In this work we examine in detail whether the Horizontal
Branch morphology and the Sub Giant structure provide further independent
indications that a real --although very small-helium spread is present in the
cluster. We re--analyze the HST archival data for the Horizontal Branch of 47
Tuc, obtaining a sample of $\sim$500 stars with very small photometric errors,
and build population synthesis based on new models to show that its particular
morphology can be better explained by taking into account a spread in helium
abundance of 2% in mass. The same variation in helium is able to explain the
spread in luminosity of the Sub Giant Branch, while a small part of the second
generation is characterized by a small C+N+O increase and provides an
explanation for the fainter Sub Giant Branch. We conclude that three
photometric features concur to form the paradigm that a small but real helium
spread is present in a cluster that has no spectacular evidence for multiple
populations like those shown by other massive clusters.

much simpler possibilities intrinsic to electromagnetism already exist from
which we may get at the FitzGerald-Lorentz contraction hypothesis. In
particular we consider an example going back to Poincar\'e in [{\it Bulletin

the problem of two moving, parallel line charges in order to get at length
contraction. We develop this model of Poincar\'e and show that it leads not

of the composition of velocities formula in special relativity for collinear
velocities.
  Red{\v z}i\'c suggests that, by considering such purely electromagnetic
examples, the Maxwellians could have been led to the contraction hypothesis
much before the time of the Michelson-Morely experiment, and we agree with him
that such elementary results as the ones discussed here could not have escaped
their attention. Apparently, it took an extremely sensitive experiment, not
intrinsic to electromagnetism, such as was the Michelson-Morley experiment,
together with the efforts of persons with authority, like Lorentz and
Poincar\'e, trying to uphold the relativity principle before the radical notion
of length contraction could seriously be entertained, and making ripe the way
for the genius of Einstein.

as template overlaps, designed to filter targeted highly boosted particle
decays from QCD jets and other background. Template overlaps are functional
measures that quantify how well the energy flow of a physical jet matches the
flow of a boosted partonic decay. Any region of the partonic phase space for
the boosted decays defines a template. We will refer to the maximum functional
overlap found this way as the template overlap. To illustrate the method, we
test lowest-order templates designed to distinguish highly-boosted top and
Higgs decays from backgrounds produced by event generators. For the functional
overlap, we find good results with a simple construction based on a Gaussian in
energy differences within angular regions surrounding the template partons.
Although different event generators give different averages for our template
overlaps, we find in each case excellent rejection power, especially when
combined with cuts based on jet shapes. The template overlaps are capable of
systematic improvement by including higher order corrections in the template
phase space.

constructed in a straightforward way if gauge and Lorentz transformations are
placed on the same foundation. As Lorentz transformations act on space-time
coordinates, gauge transformations are applied to the gauge field. Placing
these two transformations on the same ground means that all quantized field
like spin-1/2 and spin-3/2 spinors are functions not only of the coordinates
but also of the gauge field components. This change of perspective solves a
couple of problems occuring for higher spin fields like the loss of causality,
bad high-energy properties and the deviation of the gyromagnetic ratio from its
constant value g=2 for any spin, as caused by applying the minimal coupling.
Starting with a ""dynamical"" interaction, a non-minimal coupling can be derived
which is consistent with causality, the expectation for the gyromagnetic ratio,
and well-behaved for high energies. As a consequence, on this stage the
(elektromagnetic) gauge field has to be considered as classical field.
Therefore, standard quantum field theory cannot be applied. Despite this
inconvenience, such a common ground is consistent with an old dream of
physicists almost a century ago. Our approach, therefore, indicates a
straightforward way to realize this dream.

(BLR) that differs greatly in strength from object to object. We examine the
role of the total and gas-phase iron abundance in determining Fe II strength.
Using AGN spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) in the redshift
range of 0.2 < z < 0.35, we measure the Fe/Ne abundance of the narrow line
region (NLR) using the [Fe VII]/[Ne V] line intensity ratio. We find no
significant difference in the abundance of Fe relative to Ne in the NLR as a
function of Fe II/Hbeta. However, the N II/S II ratio increases a by a factor
of 2 with increasing Fe II strength. This indicates a trend in N/S abundance
ratio, and by implication in the overall metallicity of the NLR gas, with
increasing Fe II strength. We propose that the wide range of Fe II strength in
AGN largely results from the selective depletion of Fe into grains in the low
ionization portion of the BLR. Photoionization models show that the strength of
the optical Fe II lines varies almost linearly with gas-phase Fe abundance,
while the ultraviolet Fe II strength varies more weakly. Interstellar depletion
of Fe can be as large as two orders of magnitude, sufficient to explain the
wide range of optical Fe II strength in AGN. This picture is consistent with
the similarity of the BLR radius to the dust sublimation radius and with
indications of Fe II emitting gas flowing inwards from the dusty torus.

  X-ray FELs",,,,"DESY 10-080","physics.acc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Three different approaches have been proposed so far for production of highly
monochromatic X-rays from a baseline XFEL undulator: (i) single-bunch
self-seeding scheme with a four crystal monochromator in Bragg reflection
geometry; (ii) double-bunch self-seeding scheme with a four-crystal
monochromator in Bragg reflection geometry; (iii) single-bunch self-seeding
scheme with a wake monochromator. A unique element of the X-ray optical design
of the last scheme is the monochromatization of X-rays using a single crystal
in Bragg-transmission geometry. A great advantage of this method is that the
monochromator introduces no path delay of X-rays. This fact eliminates the need
for a long electron beam bypass, or for the creation of two precisely
separated, identical electron bunches, as required in the other two
self-seeding schemes. In its simplest configuration, the self-seeded XFEL
consists of an input undulator and an output undulator separated by a
monochromator. In some experimental situations this simplest two-undulator
configuration is not optimal. The obvious and technically possible extension is
to use a setup with three or more undulators separated by monochromators. This
amplification-monochromatization cascade scheme is distinguished, in
performance, by a small heat-loading of crystals and a high spectral purity of
the output radiation. This paper describes such cascade self-seeding scheme
with wake monochromators. We present feasibility study and exemplifications for
the SASE2 line of the European XFEL.

model with interactions has exact Lie algebraic supersymmetry on the lattice
for all super charges. In coordinate representation the finite difference
operator is made to satisfy Leibnitz rule by introducing a non local product,
the ``star'' product, and the exact lattice supersymmetry is realized. The
standard momentum conservation is replaced on the lattice by the conservation
of the sine of the momentum, which plays a crucial role in the formulation.
Half lattice spacing structure is essential for the one dimensional model and
the lattice supersymmetry transformation can be identified as a half lattice
spacing translation combined with alternating sign structure. Invariance under
finite translations and locality in the continuum limit are explicitly
investigated and shown to be recovered. Supersymmetric Ward identities are
shown to be satisfied at one loop level. Lie algebraic lattice supersymmetry
algebra of this model suggests a close connection with Hopf algebraic exactness
of the link approach formulation of lattice supersymmetry.

research. Most of the work in this area, focuses on designing throughput
optimal schemes for fully connected networks (no hidden nodes). But, we
demonstrate that the proposed schemes, though perform optimally in fully
connected network, achieve significantly lesser throughput even than that of
standard IEEE 802.11 in a network with hidden nodes. This motivates the need
for designing schemes that provide near optimal performance even when hidden
nodes are present. The primary reason for the failure of existing protocols in
the presence of hidden nodes is that these protocols are based on the model
developed by Bianchi. However this model does not hold when hidden nodes exist.
Moreover, analyzing networks with hidden nodes is still an open problem. Thus,
designing throughput optimal schemes in networks with hidden nodes is
particularly challenging. The novelty of our approach is that it is not based
on any underlying mathematical model, rather it directly tunes the control
variables so as to maximize the throughput. We demonstrate that this model
independent approach achieves maximum throughput in networks with hidden
terminals as well. Apart from this major contribution, we present stochastic
approximation based algorithms for achieving weighted fairness in a connected
networks. We also present a throughput optimal exponential backoff based random
access algorithm. We demonstrate that the exponential backoff based scheme may
outperform an optimal p-persistent scheme in networks with hidden terminals.
This demonstrates the merit of exponential backoff based random access schemes
which was deemed unnecessary by results shown by Bianchi.

properties of these objects (in the X-rays as well as in the optical): magnetic
fields, periodic line profile variations, recurrent photometric changes.
However, many questions remain unsolved. To clarify some of the properties of
the Of?p stars, we have continued their monitoring. A new XMM observation and
two new optical datasets were obtained. Additional information for the
prototypical Of?p trio has been found. HD108 has now reached its quiescent,
minimum-emission state, for the first time in 50--60yrs. The echelle spectra of
HD148937 confirm the presence of the 7d variations in the Balmer lines and
reveal similar periodic variations (though of lower amplitudes) in the HeI5876

prototypical Of?p stars. The new XMM observation of HD191612 was taken at the
same phase in the line modulation cycle but at a different orbital phase as
previous data. It clearly shows that the X-ray emission of HD191612 is
modulated by the 538d period and not the orbital period of 1542d - it is thus
not of colliding-wind origin and the phenomenon responsible for the optical
changes appears also at work in the high-energy domain. There are however
problems: our MHD simulations of the wind magnetic confinement predict both a
harder X-ray flux of a much larger strength than what is observed (the modeled
DEM peaks at 30-40MK, whereas the observed one peaks at 2MK) and narrow lines

spectrum access (DSA). Too high sampling rate is the main problem. Compressive
sensing (CS) can reconstruct sparse signal with much fewer randomized samples
than Nyquist sampling with high probability. Since survey shows that the
monitored signal is sparse in frequency domain, CS can deal with the sampling
burden. Random samples can be obtained by the analog-to-information converter.
Signal recovery can be formulated as an L0 norm minimization and a linear
measurement fitting constraint. In DSA, the static spectrum allocation of
primary radios means the bounds between different types of primary radios are
known in advance. To incorporate this a priori information, we divide the whole
spectrum into subsections according to the spectrum allocation policy. In the
new optimization model, the minimization of the L2 norm of each subsection is
used to encourage the cluster distribution locally, while the L0 norm of the L2
norms is minimized to give sparse distribution globally. Because the L0/L2
optimization is not convex, an iteratively re-weighted L1/L2 optimization is
proposed to approximate it. Simulations demonstrate the proposed method
outperforms others in accuracy, denoising ability, etc.

the measured mass function of the pulsar. The calculations are based on the
assumption that the radius of the companion star has reached its Roche radius
(or at 90%), but the pulsar's mass has not been assumed to be a certain value.
Our results are as follows. The companion star should be a MS. For the case
that the radius equals to its Roche one, we have a companion star with mass
$M\simeq 0.51 M_{\odot}$ and radius $R_{\rm c}\simeq 0.52R_{\odot}$, and the
inclination angle is $i\simeq 76.5^{\circ}$; for the case that the radius

Keplerian one is higher than $\sim 0.3$. The relatively low pulsar mass (about

these algebras in a two dimensional space for which the entire deformed Fock
space can be constructed explicitly, we derive the commutation relations for
the dynamical variables in noncommutative space-time. We compute minimal areas
resulting from these relations, i.e. finitely extended regions for which it is
impossible to resolve any substructure in form of measurable knowledge. The
size of the regions we find is determined by the noncommutative constant and
the deformation parameter q. Any object in this type of space-time structure
has to be of membrane type or in certain limits of string type.

unquenched result would provide a determination of the lattice scale r_0.

$x\lesssim0.047$, corresponding to the region of the phase diagram where the
itinerant antiferromagnetic and superconducting phases coexist and compete.
Direct determination of the doping-dependent $\lambda_{ab}(0)$ has allowed us
to track the evolution of the temperature-dependent superfluid density, from
which we infer the development of a pronounced superconducting gap anisotropy
at the edges of the superconducting dome.

lower limits since the inclination of the orbit to our line-of-sight is unknown
except for transiting systems. It is, however, possible to determine the
inclination angle, i, between the rotation axis of a star and an observer's
line-of-sight from measurements of the projected equatorial velocity (v sin i),
the stellar rotation period (P_rot) and the stellar radius (R_star). This
allows the removal of the sin i dependency of spectroscopically derived
extra-solar planet masses under the assumption that the planetary orbits lie
perpendicular to the stellar rotation axis. We have carried out an extensive
literature search and present a catalogue of v sin i, P_rot, and R_star
estimates for exoplanet host stars. In addition, we have used Hipparcos
parallaxes and the Barnes-Evans relationship to further supplement the R_star
estimates obtained from the literature. Using this catalogue, we have obtained
sin i estimates using a Markov-chain Monte Carlo analysis. This allows proper
1-sigma two-tailed confidence limits to be placed on the derived sin i's along
with the transit probability for each planet to be determined. While a small
proportion of systems yield sin i's significantly greater than 1, most likely
due to poor P_rot estimations, the large majority are acceptable. We are
further encouraged by the cases where we have data on transiting systems, as
the technique indicates inclinations of ~90 degrees and high transit
probabilities. In total, we estimate the true masses of 133 extra-solar
planets. Of these, only 6 have revised masses that place them above the 13
Jupiter mass deuterium burning limit. Our work reveals a population of
high-mass planets with low eccentricities and we speculate that these may
represent the signature of different planetary formation mechanisms at work.

and having a property related to the strict stability property. A
characteristic function representation for this family is obtained and its
properties are investigated. The proposed class relates to stable distributions
and includes Inverse Gaussian distribution and Levy distribution as special
cases. Due to its origin, the proposed distribution has a sufficient statistic.
Besides, it combines stability property at lower scales with an exponential
decay of the distribution's tail and has an additional flexibility due to the
convenient parametrization. Apart from the basic model, certain generalizations
are considered, including the one related to geometric stable distributions.

two specific applications to quantum information science. First, using the
multiparticle spacetime algebra (MSTA, the geometric algebra of a relativistic
configuration space), we present an explicit algebraic description of one and
two-qubit quantum states together with a MSTA characterization of one and
two-qubit quantum computational gates. Second, using the above mentioned
characterization and the GA description of the Lie algebras SO(3) and SU(2)
based on the rotor group Spin+(3, 0) formalism, we reexamine Boykin's proof of
universality of quantum gates. We conclude that the MSTA approach does lead to
a useful conceptual unification where the complex qubit space and the complex
space of unitary operators acting on them become united, with both being made
just by multivectors in real space. Finally, the GA approach to rotations based
on the rotor group does bring conceptual and computational advantages compared
to standard vectorial and matricial approaches.
