are driven by molecular motors rely on the idea that motors of different
polarities can be coordinated by external agents if arranged into a motor-cargo
complex to perform the necessary work [gross04]. Although these models have
provided us with important insights into these phenomena, there are still many
unanswered questions regarding the mechanisms through which the movement of the
complex takes place on crowded microtubules. For example (i) how does
cargo-binding affect motor motility? and in connection with that - (ii) how
does the presence of other motors (and also other cargos) on the microtubule
affect the motility of the motor-cargo complex? We discuss these questions from
a different perspective. The movement of a cargo is conceived here as a hopping
process resulting from the transference of cargo between neighboring motors. In
the light of this, we examine the conditions under which cargo might display
bidirectional movement even if directed by motors of a single polarity. The
global properties of the model in the long-time regime are obtained by mapping
the dynamics of the collection of interacting motors and cargos into an
asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) which can be resolved using the
matrix ansatz introduced by Derrida [Derrida et al].

using Perrin-Riou's p-adic regulator L_V. Denote by H(\Gamma) the algebra of
Qp-valued distributions on \Gamma = Gal(Qp(\mu (p^\infty) / Qp). Our first
result determines the H(\Gamma)-elementary divisors of the quotient of

determinant of this map with that of L_V (which can be computed via
Perrin-Riou's explicit reciprocity law), we obtain a precise description of the
images of the Coleman maps. In the case when V arises from a modular form, we
get some stronger results about the integral Coleman maps, and we can remove
many technical assumptions that were required in our previous work in order to
reformulate Kato's main conjecture in terms of cotorsion Selmer groups and
bounded p-adic L-functions.

intricate. For sufficiently high mass, there is always a second order phase
transition to the normal phase, no matter how high the superfluid velocity. For
some parameters, as we lower the temperature, this transition happens before a
first order transition to a new superconducting phase. Across this first order
transition, the gap in the transverse conductivity jumps from almost zero to
about half its maximum value. We also introduce a double scaling limit where we

two distinct states: the hard state shows emission from 1 to 150 keV, while the
soft state is mostly confined to be $<40$ keV. We model soft-state continuum
spectra with two thermal components, one of which is a multicolor accretion
disk and the other is a single-temperature blackbody to describe the boundary
layer, with additional weak Comptonization represented by either a simple power
law or the SIMPL model by Steiner et al. The hard-state continuum spectra are
modeled by a single-temperature blackbody for the boundary layer plus strong
Comptonization, modeled by a cutoff power law. While we are unable to draw firm
conclusions about the physical properties of the disk in the hard state, the
accretion disk in the soft state appears to approximately follow $L\propto
T^{3.2}$. The deviation from $L\propto T^4$, as expected from a constant inner
disk radius, might be caused by a luminosity-dependent spectral hardening
factor and/or real changes of the inner disk radius in some part of the soft
state. The boundary layer apparent emission area is roughly constant from the
hard to the soft states, with a value of about 1/11 of the neutron star
surface. The magnetic field on the surface of the NS in 4U~1705--44 is
estimated to be less than about $1.9\times 10^8$ G, assuming that the disk is
truncated by the ISCO or by the neutron star surface. Broad relativistic Fe
lines are detected in most spectra and are modeled with the diskline model. The
strength of the Fe lines is found to correlate well with the boundary layer
emission in the soft state. In the hard state, the Fe lines are probably due to
illumination of the accretion disk by the strong Comptonization emission.

from typically two different spin-down rates. Pulsars switch abruptly between

changes in the pulse shape. Many pulsar phenomena including mode-changing,

linked and caused by changes in the pulsar's magnetosphere. We consider the

configurations of long DNA strands under nano-to-micrometer sized confinement.
We therefore revisit the problem of an excluded volume polymer chain confined
between two parallel plates with varying plate separation. We show that the
non-monotonic behavior of the overall size of the chain as a function of
plate-separation, seen in computer simulations and reproduced by earlier
theories, can already be predicted on the basis of scaling arguments. However,
the behavior of the size in a plane parallel to the plates, a quantity observed
in recent experiments, is predicted to be monotonic, in contrast to the
experimental findings. We analyze this problem in depth with a mean-field
approach that maps the confined polymer onto an anisotropic Gaussian chain,
which allows the size of the polymer to be determined separately in the
confined and unconfined directions. The theory allows the analytical
construction of a smooth cross-over between the small plate-separation de
Gennes regime and the large plate-separation Flory regime. The results show
good agreement with Langevin dynamics simulations, and confirm the scaling
predictions.

addition of a single heavy 6-dimensional field that is gauge singlet, unbound

temperature is lowered. We are mainly concerned with the `solid' phase in which
bond orientational order but not positional order is long ranged. As the
temperature is lowered in the `solid' phase, the first phase transition
involving the orientation or toroidal charge of the discs is into a `gauge
toroid' phase in which the product of a magnetic toroidal parameter and an
orientation variable (for the discs) orders but due to a local gauge symmetry
these variables themselves do not individually order. Finally, in the lowest
temperature phase the gauge symmetry is broken and toroidal order and
orientational order both develop. In the `gauge toroidal' phase time reversal
invariance is broken and in the lowest temperature phase inversion symmetry is
also broken. In none of these phases is there long range order in any Fourier
component of the average spin. A definition of the toroidal magnetic moment
$T_i$ of the $i$th plaquette is proposed such that the magnetostatic
interaction between plaquettes $i$ and $j$ is proportional to $T_iT_j$.
Symmetry considerations are used to construct the magnetoelectric free energy

are allowed to be nonzero. In none of the phases does symmetry permit a
spontaneous polarization.

systems is $\sim$10% and the pair separation histogram exhibits a bimodal
distribution commonly attributed to their transient nature. However, if
primordial pairs cannot survive for long as recognizable bound systems, how are
they ending up? Here, we use simulations to confirm that merging, extreme tidal
distortion and ionization are possible depending on the initial orbital
elements and mass ratio of the pair. The nature of the dominant evolutionary
path largely depends on the strength of the local tidal field. Merging is
observed for initially close primordial binary clusters but also for wider
pairs in nearly parabolic orbits. Its characteristic timescale depends on the
initial orbital semi-major axis, eccentricity, and cluster pair mass ratio,
becoming shorter for closer, more eccentric equal mass pairs. Shredding or
extreme tidal distortion of the less massive cluster and subsequent separation
is observed in all pairs with appreciably different masses. Wide pairs steadily
evolve into the separated twins state characterized by the presence of tidal
bridges and separations of 200-500 pc after one Galactic orbit. In the Galaxy,
the vast majority of observed binary candidates appear to be following this
evolutionary path which translates into the dominant peak (25-30 pc) in the
pair separation distribution. The secondary peak at smaller separations (10-15
pc) can be explained as due to close pairs in almost circular orbits and/or
undergoing merging. Merged clusters exhibit both peculiar radial density and
velocity dispersion profiles shaped by synchronization and gravogyro
instabilities. Both simulations and observations show that, for the range of
parameters studied here, long term binary cluster stability in the Galactic
disk is unlikely.

behavioral approach to modelling dynamical systems allows this. Given a system

that of a `redundant edge'. Removal of all redundant edges makes the inferring
of structural controllability a straightforward exercise. We use standard graph
algorithms as ingredients to check these conditions and hence obtain an
algorithm to check for structural controllability. We provide an analysis of
the running time of our algorithm. When our results are applied to the familiar
state space description of a system, we obtain a novel necessary and sufficient

attributable to absorption of light from the companion in material of the

at fixed chemical composition ([{\alpha}/Fe]=+0.3, [Fe/H]=-2.32 dex, Y=0.248).
The isochrones -- assuming the same true distance modulus ({\mu}=14.74 mag),
the same reddening (E(B-V)=0.025+-0.010 mag), and the same reddening law --
account for the stellar distribution along the main sequence and the red giant
branch in different Color-Magnitude Diagrams (i',g'-i' ; i',g'-r' ; i',g'-z' ;
I,B-I ; F814W,F475W-F814W). The same outcome applies to the comparison between
the predicted Zero-Age-Horizontal-Branch (ZAHB) and the HB stars. We also found
a cluster age of 11 +/- 1.5 Gyr, in good agreement with previous estimates. The
error budget accounts for uncertainties in the input physics and the
photometry. To test the possible occurrence of CNO-enhanced stars, we also
computed two sets of {\alpha}- and CNO-enhanced (by a factor of three) models
both at fixed total metallicity ([M/H]=-2.10 dex) and at fixed iron abundance.
We found that the isochrones based on the former set give the same cluster age
(11 +/- 1.5 Gyr) as the canonical {\alpha}-enhanced isochrones. The isochrones
based on the latter set also give a similar cluster age (10 +/- 1.5 Gyr). These
indings support previous results concerning the weak sensitivity of cluster
isochrones to CNO-enhanced chemical mixtures.

accumulation at edges of a 2D topological insulator taking into account
reflection from edges. Accumulation occurs only at edge states, which
distinguish topological insulators from conventional ones. The band continuum
can support the transverse bulk spin (moment) current, but it does not governed
by the topological Chern number and may exist in a conventional insulator.
There is no edge accumulation related with bulk currents.

fact, during inflation there is no difference between scalar-tensor theories,
