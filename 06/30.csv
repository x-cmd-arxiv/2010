three units smaller than the total power of coupling constants (i.e., leading,

simulations of unmagnetized dense plasma jet injection into a uniform hot
strongly magnetized plasma, with the aim of providing insight into core fueling
of a tokamak with parameters relevant for ITER and NSTX (National Spherical
Torus Experiment). Unmagnetized dense plasma jet injection is similar to
compact toroid injection but with much higher plasma density and total mass,
and consequently lower required injection velocity. Mass deposition of the jet
into the background appears to be facilitated via magnetic reconnection along
the jet's trailing edge. The penetration depth of the plasma jet into the
background plasma is mostly dependent on the jet's initial kinetic energy, and
a key requirement for spatially localized mass deposition is for the jet's
slowing-down time to be less than the time for the perturbed background
magnetic flux to relax due to magnetic reconnection. This work suggests that
more accurate treatment of reconnection is needed to fully model this problem.
Parameters for unmagnetized dense plasma jet injection are identified for
localized core deposition as well as edge localized mode (ELM) pacing
applications in ITER and NSTX-relevant regimes.

which expectation values are not misleading. We also examine the frequently

easy-to-check bounds on the overall Aloha stability region because they
potentially require checking membership in an uncountably infinite number of

an important specific inner bound on Aloha that has this property of difficulty
to check membership in the set. We provide ellipsoids (for which membership is
easy-to-check) that we conjecture are inner and outer bounds on this set. We
also study the set of controls that stabilize a fixed arrival rate vector; this

  Principle","There are 55 pages, 46 references and 0 figures",,,,"math.PR cs.PF","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We prove a many-server heavy-traffic fluid limit for an overloaded Markovian
queueing system having two customer classes and two service pools, known in the
call-center literature as the X model. The system uses the
fixed-queue-ratio-with-thresholds (FQR-T) control, which we proposed in a
recent paper as a way for one service system to help another in face of an
unexpected overload. Under FQR-T, customers are served by their own service
pool until a threshold is exceeded. Then, one-way sharing is activated with
customers from one class allowed to be served in both pools. After the control
is activated, it aims to keep the two queues at a pre-specified fixed ratio.
For large systems that fixed ratio is achieved approximately. For the fluid
limit, or FWLLN, we consider a sequence of properly scaled X models in overload
operating under FQR-T. Our proof of the FWLLN follows the compactness approach,
i.e., we show that the sequence of scaled processes is tight, and then show
that all converging subsequences have the specified limit. The characterization
step is complicated because the queue-difference processes, which determine the
customer-server assignments, remain stochastically bounded, and need to be
considered without spatial scaling. Asymptotically, these queue-difference
processes operate in a faster time scale than the fluid-scaled processes. In
the limit, due to a separation of time scales, the driving processes converge
to a time-dependent steady state (or local average) of a time-varying
fast-time-scale process (FTSP). This averaging principle (AP) allows us to
replace the driving processes with the long-run average behavior of the FTSP.

approximate quark-lepton symmetry inspired from SO(10) gauge unification
(assuming a Dirac neutrino mass matrix close to the up quark mass matrix), we
construct a {\it fine tuning} scenario for baryogenesis via leptogenesis. We
find two solutions with a normal hierarchy, with the lightest neutrino mass
$m_1$ different from zero, providing an absolute scale for the spectrum. In the
approximations of the model, there are three independent CP phases : $\delta_L$
(that we take of the order of the quark Kobayashi-Maskawa phase) and the two
light neutrino Majorana phases $\alpha$ and $\beta$. A main conclusion is that,
although this general scheme is rather flexible, in some regions of parameter
space we find that the necessary baryogenesis with its sign is given in terms
of the $\delta_L$ phase alone. The light Majorana phases can also be computed
and turn out to be close of $\pi/2$ or small. Moreover, SO(10) breaks down to
the Pati-Salam group $SU(4) \times SU(2) \times SU(2)$ at the expected natural
intermediate scale of about $10^{10}-10^{11}\ GeV$. A prediction is done for
the effective mass in $(\beta \beta)_{0\nu}$ decay, the $\nu_e$ mass and the

erg/s which is continuous over ~6-8 decades in P_jet and P_rad with a scatter
of approximately 0.7 dex. Our mean scaling relationship is consistent with the
model presented in Willott et al. (1999) if the typical fraction of lobe energy
in non-radiating particles to that in relativistic electrons is > 100. We
identify several gEs whose radio luminosities are unusually large for their jet

their X-ray halos. We suggest that these radio sources are unusually luminous

If a conical symplectic structure is also smooth with respect to a compatible

through various interactions with the electromagnetic fields in different

depending on the particle's charge, quantitatively. Based on this model, a
considerable portion of the dynamics, that derives a charged particle parallel
to a magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ and under the influence of a force
$\mathbf{F}$, is assumed to be composed of an acceleration by a non-magnetic
force $\mathbf{F}_{\parallel}$ and a gyromotion along $\mathbf{B}$ direction,
plus drifts in the direction of $\mathbf{F}_{\perp}$. The model and its
formalism are introduced. Various examples for drift motions and accelerating

Obviously, the translation into the relativistic version is standard. In a

to 2.5 M_sun stars including atomic diffusion and radiative accelerations for
all species within the OPAL opacity database were computed with mass loss and
compared to observations as well as previous calculations with turbulent
mixing. Models with unseparated mass loss rates between 5 x 10^-14 and 10^-13
M_sun/yr reproduce observations for many cluster AmFm stars as well as Sirius A

lithium gap. Like turbulent mixing, these mass loss rates reduce surface
abundance anomalies; however, their effects are very different with respect to
internal abundances. For most of the main sequence lifetime of an A or F star,
surface abundances in the presence of such mass loss depend on separation which
takes place between log(Delta M/M_star)= -6 and -5. The current observational
constraints do not allow us to conclude that mass loss is to be preferred over
turbulent mixing (induced by rotation or otherwise) in order to explain the
AmFm phenomenon. Internal concentration variations which could be detectable
through asteroseismic tests should provide further information. If atomic
diffusion coupled with mass loss are to explain the Hyades Li gap, the wind

metallicity, and to a lesser extent SFRs that were not evident in the original,
smaller sample studied previously. The luminosity--metallicity relation has a
flatter slope for dwarf galaxies as has been indicated by previous work. We
also show a relationship between the 8.0 \um\ luminosity and the metallicity of
the galaxy which is not expected given the competing effects (stellar mass,
stellar population age, and the hardness of the radiation field) that influence
the 8.0 \um\ emission. This larger sample plus a well-defined selection

it with the one for the local galaxy population. Our results show that below

observed galaxy properties, as well as the evolution of their stellar masses
and star formation rates. In particular, in the current theoretical paradigm of
galaxy formation, AGN feedback is believed to play a crucial role in regulating
the levels of activity in galaxies, in relatively massive halos at low
redshift. Only in recent years, however, has detailed statistical information
on the dependence of galaxy activity on stellar mass, parent halo mass and
hierarchy has become available. In this paper, we compare the fractions of
galaxies belonging to different activity classes (star-forming, AGN and radio
active) with predictions from four different and independently developed
semi-analytical models. We adopt empirical relations to convert physical
properties into observables (H_alpha emission lines, OIII line strength and
radio power). We demonstrate that all models used in this study reproduce the
overall distributions of galaxies belonging to different activity classes as a
function of stellar mass and halo mass: star forming galaxies and the strongest
radio sources are preferentially associated with low-mass and high-mass
galaxies/halos respectively. However, model predictions differ from
observational measurements in a number of ways. All models used in our study
predict that almost every >1.e12 Msun dark matter halo and/or >1.e11 Msun
galaxy should host a bright radio source, while only a small fraction of
galaxies belong to this class in the data. In addition, radio brightness is
expected to depend strongly on the mass of the parent halo mass in the models,
while strong and weak radio galaxies are found in similar environments in data.
Our results highlight that the distribution of AGN as a function of stellar
mass provides one of the most promising discriminants between different gas
accretion schemes.

Nanoscale effects modify the spontaneous detachment of monomers due to the
finite amount of internal energy contained in small clusters. We find that both
corrections have a big impact on the stability of the clusters and on the rate
of nucleation. We implement our model within a Monte Carlo code to derive the
new stability conditions for clusters as well as nucleation rates. Due to
computing limitations, we can explore the consequences of this approach only at
high temperatures, at which particle interactions are not much less frequent
than photon interactions. We found that the combined effect of the detachment
correction and the temperature fluctuations produces faster nucleation. We also
found that the nucleation rate depends on the composition of the gas and not
only on the partial pressure of the compound that condensates into grains. This

notion is important because the Nichols algebra associated to a rack of type D
and any cocycle has infinite dimension. For those racks not of type D, the
computation of the cohomology groups is needed. We discuss some techniques for
this problem and compute explicitly the cohomology groups corresponding to some
conjugacy classes in symmetric or alternating groups of low order.

their associated gravitational fields on the stationary galactic superwind
solution. We do this by considering an analogue injection of mass and energy
from stellar winds and SNe. We give analytical formulae that establish when an
outflow is possible and also characterize distinct flow regimes and enrichment
scenarios. We also constraint the parameter space by giving approximate limits
above which gravitation, self-gravitation and radiative cooling can inhibit the
stationary flow. Later, we obtain analytical expressions for the free superwind
hydrodynamical profiles. We find that the existence or inhibition of the
superwind solution highly depends on the steepness and concentration of the
dynamical mass and the mass and energy injection rates, not just in their
effective total values. We compare our results with observational data and a
recent numerical work that models artificial massive galaxies assuming a
uniform distribution of their parameters. Finally, we put our results in the
context of the mass-metallicity relationship to discuss observational evidence
related to the selective loss of metals from the less massive galaxies and the
recent discovery of high-metallicity dwarf spheroidal (dSph) and dwarf
elliptical (dE) galaxies.

fully relativistic accretion-disk model, we analyze hundreds of spectra
collected during eight X-ray missions that span 26 years. For a selected sample

accretion disk is constant over time and unaffected by source variability. Even
considering an ensemble of eight X-ray missions, we find consistent values of
the radius to within ~4-6 percent. Our results provide strong evidence for the
existence of a fixed inner-disk radius. The only reasonable inference is that
this radius is closely associated with the general relativistic innermost
stable circular orbit (ISCO). Our findings establish a firm foundation for the

from any of numerous sources: they can be empirical or synthetic, they can
arise from multiple realizations of a single process, empirical or synthetic,
or they can represent entirely different systems in different disciplines.
Since the mesoscopic properties of networks are hypothesized to be important
for network function, we base our comparisons on summaries of network community
structures. While we use a specific method for uncovering network communities,
much of the introduced framework is independent of that choice. After
introducing the framework, we apply it to construct a taxonomy for 746
individual networks and demonstrate that our approach usefully identifies
similar networks. We also construct taxonomies within individual categories of
networks, and in each case we expose non-trivial structure. For example we
create taxonomies for similarity networks constructed from both political
voting data and financial data. We also construct network taxonomies to compare
the social structures of 100 Facebook networks and the growth structures

the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), providing imaging, coronagraphy and
spectroscopy over the 5-28 microns band. To verify the optical performance of
the instrument, extensive tests were performed at CEA on the flight model (FM)
of the Mid-InfraRed IMager (MIRIM) at cryogenic temperatures and in the
infrared. This paper reports on the point spread function (PSF) measurements at
5.6 microns, the shortest operating wavelength for imaging. At 5.6 microns the
PSF is not Nyquist-sampled, so we use am original technique that combines a
microscanning measurement strategy with a deconvolution algorithm to obtain an
over-resolved MIRIM PSF. The microscanning consists in a sub-pixel scan of a
point source on the focal plane. A data inversion method is used to reconstruct
PSF images that are over-resolved by a factor of 7 compared to the native
resolution of MIRI. We show that the FWHM of the high-resolution PSFs were
5-10% wider than that obtained with Zemax simulations. The main cause was
identified as an out-of-specification tilt of the M4 mirror. After correction,
two additional test campaigns were carried out, and we show that the shape of
the PSF is conform to expectations. The FWHM of the PSFs are 0.18-0.20 arcsec,
in agreement with simulations. 56.1-59.2% of the total encircled energy
(normalized to a 5 arcsec radius) is contained within the first dark Airy ring,
over the whole field of view. At longer wavelengths (7.7-25.5 microns), this
percentage is 57-68%. MIRIM is thus compliant with the optical quality
requirements. This characterization of the MIRIM PSF, as well as the
deconvolution method presented here, are of particular importance, not only for
the verification of the optical quality and the MIRI calibration, but also for
scientific applications.

predict a yellow supergiant duration an order of magnitude longer than we
observed. Here we turn our attention to the SMC, where the metallicity is 10x
lower than that of M31, which is important as metallicity strongly affects
massive star evolution. The SMC's large radial velocity (~160 km/s) allows us
to separate members from foreground stars. Observations of ~500 candidates

foreground contamination of >4%. After placing the SMC supergiants on the H-R

results similar to those of the M31 study: while the locations of the stars on
the H-R diagram match the locations of evolutionary tracks well, the models
over-predict the yellow supergiant lifetime by a factor of ten. Uncertainties
about the mass-loss rates on the main-sequence thus cannot be the primary

today's world. Retailers are also trying to reap in the benefits of the ERP. In
most large Indian Retail Industry ERP systems have replaced nonintegrated
information systems with integrated and maintainable software. Retail ERP
solution integrates demand and supply effectively to help improve bottom line.
The implementation of ERP systems in such firms is a difficult task. So far,
ERP implementations have yielded more failures than successes. Very few
implementation failures are recorded in the literature because few companies
wish to publicize their implementation failure. This paper explores and
validates the existing literature empirically to find out the critical success
factors that lead to the success of ERP in context to Indian retail industry.
The findings of the results provide valuable insights for the researchers and
practitioners who are interested in implementing Enterprise Resource Planning
systems in retail industry, how best they can utilize their limited resources
and to pay adequate attention to those factors that are most likely to have an
impact upon the implementation of the ERP system.

SNIa. The explosions and progenitors of SNIa can be probed by MeV nuclear gamma
rays emitted in the decays of radioactive nickel and cobalt into iron. We
compare the cosmic star formation and SNIa rates, finding that their different
redshift evolution requires a large fraction of SNIa to have large delay times.
A delay time distribution of the form t^{-1.0 +/- 0.3} provides a good fit,
implying 50% of SNIa explode more than ~ 1 Gyr after progenitor birth. The
extrapolation of the cosmic SNIa rate to z = 0 agrees with the rate we deduce
from catalogs of local SNIa. We investigate prospects for gamma-ray telescopes

of SNIa and uniquely provide tomography of the expanding ejecta. We find large
improvements relative to earlier studies by Gehrels et al. in 1987 and Timmes &
Woosley in 1997 due to larger and more certain SNIa rates and advances in
gamma-ray detectors. The proposed Advanced Compton Telescope, with a
narrow-line sensitivity ~ 60 times better than that of current satellites,
would, on an annual basis, detect up to ~ 100 SNIa (3 sigma) and provide
revolutionary model discrimination for SNIa within 20 Mpc, with gamma-ray light

the Sigma_{H2} values are mostly within 10-40 M_solar pc^{-2}. The surface
density of gas and that of SFR correlate well at a ~1-kpc resolution, but the

distinct phases characterized by different behavior of relaxation rates. The
first phase exists in an intermediate range of K^{*}(g)<K<K_{c}(g). It has two
regimes of energies: at low excitation energies, \omega<\omega_{d}(K,g), the
many-body spectrum of the model is discrete, with zero level widths, while at
\omega>\omega_{d} the level acquire a non-zero width which is self-generated by
the many-body interactions. In this phase the spin model provides by itself an
intrinsic thermal bath. Another phase is obtained at smaller K<K^{*}(g), where
all the eigenstates are discrete, corresponding to full many-body localization.

chromospheric emission in an active region core observed by the Solar Optical

unipolar, the spatial distribution of magnetic flux evolves slowly, and the
magnetic field is only moderately inclined. We show that the field line
inclination and horizontal component are coherent, and that the magnetic field
is mostly sheared in the inter-moss regions where the highest magnetic flux
variability is seen. Using extrapolations from SP magnetograms we show that the
magnetic connectivity in the moss is different than in the quiet Sun because
most of the magnetic field extends to significant coronal heights. The magnetic
flux, field vector, and chromospheric emission in the moss also appear highly
dynamic, but actually show only small scale variations in magnitude on
time-scales longer than the cooling times for hydrodynamic loops computed from
our extrapolations, suggesting high-frequency (continuous) heating events. Some
evidence is found for flux (Ca 2 intensity) changes on the order of 100--200 G
(DN) on time-scales of 20--30 mins that could be taken as indicative of
low-frequency heating. We find, however, that only a small fraction (10%) of
our simulated loops would be expected to cool on these time-scales, and we find
no clear evidence that the flux changes consistently produce intensity changes
in the chromosphere. The magnetic flux and chromospheric intensity in most
individual SOT pixels in the moss vary by less than ~ 20% and ~ 10%,
respectively, on loop cooling time-scales. In view of the high energy
requirements of the chromosphere, we suggest that these variations could be
sufficient for the heating of `warm' EUV loops, but that the high basal levels
may be more important for powering the hot core loops rooted in the moss.

large scale structure formation of the universe in the post-reionization era,
which is conventionally characterized via gas hydrodynamics, should include the
plasma collective effects in the formulation. Specifically, it is the combined
pressure from the baryon thermal motions and the residual long-range
electrostatic potentials resulted from the imperfect Debye shielding, that
fights against the gravitational collapse. As a result, at small-scales the
baryons would oscillate at the ion-acoustic, instead of the conventional
neutral acoustic, frequency. In this paper we extend and improve the Chen-Lai
formulation with the attention to the Landau damping of the ion-acoustic
oscillations. Since T_e \sim T_i in the post-reionization era, the ion acoustic
oscillations would inevitably suffer the Landau damping which severely
suppresses the baryon density spectrum in the regimes of intermediate and high
wavenumber k. To describe this Landau-damping phenomenon more appropriately, we
find it necessary to modify the filtering wavenumber k_f in our analysis. It
would be interesting if our predicted Landau damping of the ion-acoustic
oscillations can be observed at high redshifts.

compare them for three-qubit pure and mixed GHZ and W states. We find that

partial hydrophobicity of the polyion chain, ionic strength). The structures on
a 15 scale range lying from 10{\AA} to 1000{\AA} are measured by SANS. Whatever
the conditions, the same structure is found, based on the formation of dense
globules of ~ 100{\AA} with a neutral core and a volume fraction of organic
species (compacity) of ~ 0.3. At higher scale, the globules are arranged in
fractal aggregates. Zetametry measurements show that globular complexes have a
total positive charge when the charge ratio of species introduced in the
mixture [-]/[+]intro > 1 and a total 20 negative charge when [-]/[+]intro < 1.
This comes from the presence of charged species in slight excess in a layer at
the surface of the globules. The globule finite size is determined by the Debye
length k-1 whatever the way the physicochemical parameters are modified in the
system, as long as chain-protein interactions are of simple electrostatics
nature. The mean number of proteins per primary complex Nlyso_comp grows
exponentially on a master curve with k-1. This enables to picture 25 the
mechanisms of formation of the complexes. There is an initial stage of
formation where the growth of the complexes is only driven by attractions
between opposite species associated with counterion release. During the growth
of the complexes, the globules progressively repell themselves by electrostatic
repulsion because their charge increases. When this repulsion becomes dominent
in the system, globules stop growing and behave like charged colloids: they
aggregate 30 with a RLCA process, which leads to the formation of fractal
aggregates of dimension Df 2.1.

non-Gaussianity where the perturbations in the Bardeen potential are given by a
dominant Gaussian part plus a non-Gaussian part specified by its bispectrum.
The approach we explore here is suitable for any bispectrum, i.e. it does not
have to be of the so-called separable or factorizable form. The procedure of
generating a non-Gaussian field with a given bispectrum (and a given power
spectrum for the Gaussian component) is not univocal, and care must be taken so
that higher-order corrections do not leave a too large signature on the power
spectrum. This is so far a limiting factor of our approach. We then run N-body
simulations for the most popular inflationary-motivated non-Gaussian shapes.
The halo mass function and the non-linear power spectrum agree with theoretical
analytical approximations proposed in the literature, even if they were so far
developed and tested only for a particular shape (the local one). We plan to
make the simulations outputs available to the community via the non-Gaussian

investigating techniques for provision of highly generic storage facilities
that can be tailored to produce various individually customised storage

requires the separation of mechanism and policy wherever possible. Aspirations
include: actors, whether users or individual processes, should be able to bind
to, update and manipulate data and programs transparently with respect to their
respective locations; programs should be expressed independently of the storage
and network technology involved in their execution; storage facilities should
be structure-neutral so that actors can impose multiple interpretations over
information, simultaneously and safely; information should not be discarded so
that arbitrary historical views are supported; raw stored information should be
open to all; where security restrictions on its use are required this should be
achieved using cryptographic techniques. The key advances of the research were:
1) the identification of a candidate set of minimal storage system building
blocks, which are sufficiently simple to avoid encapsulating policy where it
cannot be customised by applications, and composable to build highly flexible
storage architectures 2) insight into the nature of append-only storage

conjecture, due to Wenhua Zhao, the Image Conjecture. This conjecture implies
the Generalized Vanishing Conjecture and hence the Jacobian Conjecture.
  Crucial ingredient is the notion of a Mathieu space: let $k$ be a field and
$R$ a commutative $k$-algebra. A $k$-linear subspace $M$ of $R$ is called a
Mathieu subspace of $R$, if the following holds: let $f\in R$ be such that
$f^m\in M$, for all $m\geq 1$, then for every $g\in R$ also $gf^m\in M$, for
almost all $m$, i.e. only finitely many exceptions.
  Let $A$ be the polynomial ring in $\zeta=\zeta_1, ...,\zeta_n$ and $z_1,
...,z_n$ over $\mathbb C$. The Image Conjecture (IC) asserts that
$\sum_i(\partial_{z_i}-\zeta_i)A$ is a Mathieu subspace of $A$. We prove this
conjecture for $n=1$. Also we relate (IC) to the following Integral Conjecture:
if $B$ is an open subset of $\mathbb R^n$ and $\sigma$ a positive measure, such
that the integral over $B$ of each polynomial in $z$ over $\mathbb C$ is
finite, then the set of polynomials, whose integral over $B$ is zero, is a
Mathieu subspace of $\mathbb C[z]$. It turns out that Laguerre polynomials play
a special role in the study of the Jacobian Conjecture.

Supervisor: Graham Kirby",,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The ever-increasing complexity of software systems makes them hard to
comprehend, predict and tune due to emergent properties and non-deterministic
behaviour. Complexity arises from the size of software systems and the wide
variety of possible operating environments: the increasing choice of platforms
and communication policies leads to ever more complex performance
characteristics. In addition, software systems exhibit different behaviour
under different workloads. Many software systems are designed to be
configurable so that policies can be chosen to meet the needs of various
stakeholders. For complex software systems it can be difficult to accurately
predict the effects of a change and to know which configuration is most
appropriate. This thesis demonstrates that it is useful to run automated
experiments that measure a selection of system configurations. Experiments can
find configurations that meet the stakeholders' needs, find interesting
behavioural characteristics, and help produce predictive models of the system's
behaviour. The design and use of ACT (Automated Configuration Tool) for running
such experiments is described, in combination a number of search strategies for
deciding on the configurations to measure. Design Of Experiments (DOE) is
discussed, with emphasis on Taguchi Methods. These statistical methods have
been used extensively in manufacturing, but have not previously been used for
configuring software systems. The novel contribution here is an industrial case
study, applying the combination of ACT and Taguchi Methods to DC-Directory, a
product from Data Connection Ltd (DCL). The case study investigated the
applicability of Taguchi Methods for configuring complex software systems.
Taguchi Methods were found to be useful for modelling and configuring DC-

the relevant presence of Mn$^{2+}$ ions, which is unambiguously proved to be

proved to be directly correlated to the enhanced magneto-transport properties
because of an additional hopping mechanism trough interfiling Mn$^{2+}$-ions,
theoretically confirmed by calculations within the effective single band model.
The very idea to use Mn$^{2+}$ both as a doping element and an ions
electronically involved in the conduction mechanism, has never been foreseen,
revealing a new phenomena in transport properties of manganites. More
important, such a strategy might be also pursed in other strongly correlated

Our argument is based on the fact that the spin fluctuation occurring during

geometric phase at the critical regime. The correlation function of the random
geometric phase determines the excitation probability of the quasiparticles,
which are excited during the transition from the inital paramagnetic to the

of Solar System bodies. These processes deform the lithosphere until it breaks
along faults. The type and orientation of faults are usually determined under
the assumption of a constant lithospheric thickness, but lithospheric thinning
can occur at the equator or at the poles due either to latitudinal variation in
solar insolation or to localized tidal dissipation. Using thin elastic shells
with variable thickness, I show that the equatorial thinning of the lithosphere
transforms the homogeneous and isotropic fault pattern caused by
contraction/expansion into a pattern of faults striking east-west, preferably
formed in the equatorial region. By contrast, lithospheric thickness variations
only weakly affect the despinning faulting pattern consisting of equatorial
strike-slip faults and polar normal faults. If contraction is added to
despinning, the despinning pattern first shifts to thrust faults striking
north-south and then to thrust faults striking east-west. If the lithosphere is
thinner at the poles, the tectonic pattern caused by contraction/expansion
consists of faults striking north/south. On Iapetus, contraction or expansion
on a lithosphere thinner at the equator explains the location and orientation
of the equatorial ridge. On Mercury, the combination of contraction and
despinning makes possible the existence of zonal provinces of thrust faults
differing in orientation (north-south or east-west), which may be relevant to
the orientation of lobate scarps.

known is the Cooper-Frye description used to generate the phase space
distribution of emitted, non-interacting, particles from a fluid dynamical
expansion/explosion, assuming a final ideal gas distribution, or (less
frequently) an out of equilibrium distribution. In this work we do not want to
replace the Cooper-Frye description, rather clarify the ways how to use it and
how to choose the parameters of the distribution, eventually how to choose the
form of the phase space distribution used in the Cooper-Frye formula. Moreover,
the Cooper-Frye formula is used in connection with the freeze-out problem,
while the discussion of transition between different stages of the collision is
applicable to other transitions also. More recently hadronization and molecular
dynamics models are matched to the end of a fluid dynamical stage to describe
hadronization and freeze-out. The stages of the model description can be
matched to each other on spacetime hypersurfaces (just like through the
frequently used freeze-out hypersurface). This work presents a generalized
description of how to match the stages of the description of a reaction to each

part of the interatomic potential $V_\textrm{He}$ between $^{4}\textrm{He}$

method and next by a modified version of this method, which takes approximate
account of those terms of the 2-body repulsion which are linear in the

Bogoliubov). Theoretical heat capacity $C_V(T)$ exhibits good agreement, below

integrate these maps are expressed by linguistic descriptions and modeled by
fuzzy rules. The main difference of this approach from other studies reported
in the literature is that the method presented here is based on the hypothesis
that the concepts ""occupied"" and ""empty"" are antonyms rather than complementary
(as it happens in probabilistic approaches), or independent (as it happens in
the previous fuzzy models).
  Controlled experimentation with a real robot in three representative indoor
environments has been performed and the results presented. We offer a
qualitative and quantitative comparison of the estimated maps obtained by the
probabilistic approach, the previous fuzzy method and the new antonyms-based
fuzzy approach. It is shown that the maps obtained with the antonyms-based
approach are better defined, capture better the shape of the walls and of the
empty-spaces, and contain less errors due to rebounds and short-echoes.
Furthermore, in spite of noise and low resolution inherent to the sonar-sensors
used, the maps obtained are accurate and tolerant to imprecision.

predictions. In this work we propose a framework for online event segmentation,
targeting robots endowed with active perception. Moreover, sensory processing
systems have an intrinsic latency, resulting from many factors such as sampling
rate, and computational processing, and which is seldom accounted for. This
framework is founded on the theory of dynamical systems synchronization, where
the system considered includes both the robot and the world coupled (strong
anticipation). An adaption rule is used to perform simultaneous system
identification and synchronization, and anticipating synchronization is
employed to predict the short-term system evolution. This prediction allows for
an appropriate control of the robot actuation. Event boundaries are detected
once synchronization is lost (sudden increase of the prediction error). An
experimental proof of concept of the proposed framework is presented, together
with some preliminary results corroborating the approach.

sciences as these regimes provide one way to operationalize and thus inform
sequential personalized clinical decision making. A dynamic treatment regime is
a sequence of decision rules, with a decision rule per stage of clinical
intervention; each decision rule maps up-to-date patient information to a
recommended treatment. We briefly review a variety of approaches for using data
to construct the decision rules. We then review an interesting challenge, that
of nonregularity that often arises in this area. By nonregularity, we mean the
parameters indexing the optimal dynamic treatment regime are nonsmooth
functionals of the underlying generative distribution.
  A consequence is that no regular or asymptotically unbiased estimator of
these parameters exists. Nonregularity arises in inference for parameters in
the optimal dynamic treatment regime; we illustrate the effect of nonregularity
on asymptotic bias and via sensitivity of asymptotic, limiting, distributions
to local perturbations. We propose and evaluate a locally consistent Adaptive
Confidence Interval (ACI) for the parameters of the optimal dynamic treatment
regime. We use data from the Adaptive Interventions for Children with ADHD
study as an illustrative example. We conclude by highlighting and discussing
emerging theoretical problems in this area.

confined to a long cylindrical pore, the phase transition is shifted (mostly
due to surface effects at the walls of the pore) and rounded (due to finite
size effects). The nature of the phase coexistence at the transition depends on
the length of the pore: For very long pores the system is axially homogeneous
at low temperatures. At the chemical potential where the transition takes place
fluctuations occur between vapor-like and liquid-like states of the cylinder as
a whole. At somewhat higher temperatures (but still far below bulk criticality)
the system at phase coexistence is in an axially inhomogeneous multi-domain
state, where long cylindrical liquid-like and vapor-like domains alternate.
Using Monte Carlo simulations for the Ising/lattice gas model and the
Asakura-Oosawa model of colloid-polymer mixtures the transition between these
two different scenarios is characterized. It is shown that the density
distribution changes gradually from a double-peak structure to a triple-peak
shape, and the correlation length in axial direction (measuring the equilibrium
domain length) becomes much smaller than the cylinder length. The (rounded)
transition to the disordered phase of the fluid occurs when the axial
correlation length has decreased to a value comparable to the cylinder
diameter. It is also suggested that adsorption hysteresis vanishes when the
transition from the simple domain state to the multi-domain state of the
cylindrical pore occurs. We predict that the difference between the pore
critical temperature and the hysteresis critical emperature should increase
logarithmically with the length of the pore.

interfacial region with respect to heat and mass transfer. Postulating the
local Gibbs relation for a continuous description inside the interfacial
region, we derive the description of the Gibbs surface in terms of excess
densities and fluxes along the surface. We introduce overall interfacial
resistances and conductances as the coefficients in the force-flux relations
for the Gibbs surface. We derive relations between the local resistivities for
the continuous description inside the interfacial region and the overall
resistances of the surface for transport between the two phases for a mixture.
It is shown that interfacial resistances depend among other things on the
enthalpy profile across the interface. Since this variation is substantial the
coupling between heat and mass flow across the surface are also substantial. In
particular, the surface puts up much more resistance to the heat and mass
transfer then the homogeneous phases over a distance comparable to the
thickness of the surface. This is the case not only for the pure heat
conduction and diffusion but also for the cross effects like thermal diffusion.
For the excess fluxes along the surface and the corresponding thermodynamic
forces we derive expressions for excess conductances as integrals over the
local conductivities along the surface. We also show that the curvature of the
surface affects only the overall resistances for transport across the surface
and not the excess conductivities along the surface.

recovery from ischaemia-like conditions. The main factors included in our
analysis are macroscopic gradients of the cell-to-cell coupling and cell
excitability and microscopic heterogeneity of individual cells. The interplay
between these factors allows one to explain how spirals form, drift together
with the moving boundary, get transiently pinned to local inhomogeneities, and
finally penetrate into the bulk of the well-coupled tissue where they reach
macroscopic scale. The asymptotic theory of the drift of spiral and scroll
waves based on response functions provides explanation of the drifts involved
in this mechanism, with the exception of effects due to the discreteness of
cardiac tissue. In particular, this asymptotic theory allows an extrapolation
of 2D events into 3D, which has shown that cells within the border zone can
give rise to 3D analogues of spirals, the scroll waves. When and if such scroll
waves escape into a better coupled tissue, they are likely to collapse due to
the positive filament tension. However, our simulations have shown that such
collapse of newly generated scrolls is not inevitable and that under certain

uncertainties in chemical evolution model predictions related to the underlying
model assumptions. Specifically, it deals with the uncertainties due to the
choice of the stellar yields. We adopt a widely used model for the chemical
evolution of the Galaxy and test the effects of changing the stellar
nucleosynthesis prescriptions on the predicted evolution of several chemical
species. We find that, except for a handful of elements whose nucleosynthesis
in stars is well understood by now, large uncertainties still affect the model
predictions. This is especially true for the majority of the iron-peak
elements, but also for much more abundant species such as carbon and nitrogen.
The main causes of the mismatch we find among the outputs of different models
assuming different stellar yields and among model predictions and observations
are: (i) the adopted location of the mass cut in models of type II supernova
explosions; (ii) the adopted strength and extent of hot bottom burning in
models of asymptotic giant branch stars; (iii) the neglection of the effects of
rotation on the chemical composition of the stellar surfaces; (iv) the adopted
rates of mass loss and of (v) nuclear reactions, and (vi) the different
treatments of convection. Our results suggest that it is mandatory to include
processes such as hot bottom burning in intermediate-mass stars and rotation in
stars of all masses in accurate studies of stellar evolution and
nucleosynthesis. In spite of their importance, both these processes still have
to be better understood and characterized. As for massive stars, presupernova
models computed with mass loss and rotation are available in the literature,
but they still wait for a self-consistent coupling with the results of
explosive nucleosynthesis computations.

in these probable nuclear star clusters exceeds those of most GCs: these
massive clusters are located in a region intermediate between normal GCs and
dwarf galaxies. M54 shows the Na-O anticorrelation, typical signature of GCs,
which is instead absent in the Sgr nucleus. The light elements (Mg, Al, Si)
participating to the high temperature Mg-Al cycle show that the pattern of
(anti)correlations produced by proton-capture reactions in H-burning is clearly
different between the most metal-rich and most metal-poor components in the two
most massive GCs in the Galaxy, confirming early result based on the Na-O
anticorrelation. As in omega Cen, stars affected by most extreme processing,

metal-rich component. This can be understood if the burst of star formation
giving birth to the metal-rich component was delayed by as much as 10-30 Myr

reconciled in the general scenario for the formation of GCs sketched in

intermediate-mass star Vega raises the question of the origin of this magnetism
in a class of stars that was not known to host magnetic fields. We aim to
confirm the field detection and provide additional observational constraints
about the field characteristics, by modelling the magnetic geometry of the star
and by investigating the seasonal variability of the reconstructed field. We
analyse a total of 799 circularly-polarized spectra collected with the NARVAL
and ESPaDOnS spectropolarimeters during 2008 and 2009. We employ a
cross-correlation procedure to compute, from each spectrum, a mean polarized
line profile with a signal-to-noise ratio of about 20,000. The technique of
Zeeman-Doppler Imaging is then used to determine the rotation period of the
star and reconstruct the large-scale magnetic geometry of Vega at two different
epochs. We confirm the detection of circularly polarized signatures in the mean
line profiles. The amplitude of the signatures is larger when spectral lines of
higher magnetic sensitivity are selected for the analysis, as expected for a
signal of magnetic origin. The short-term evolution of polarized signatures is
consistent with a rotational period of 0.732 \pm 0.008 d. The reconstructed
magnetic topology unveils a magnetic region of radial field orientation,
closely concentrated around the rotation pole. This polar feature is
accompanied by a small number of magnetic patches at lower latitudes. No
significant variability in the field structure is observed over a time span of
one year. The repeated observation of a weak photospheric magnetic field on
Vega suggests that a previously unknown type of magnetic stars exists in the
intermediate-mass domain. Vega may well be the first confirmed member of a much
larger, as yet unexplored, class of weakly-magnetic stars.

the planetary nebula Abell 41, which is known to contain the well-studied
close-binary system MT Ser. This object represents an important test case in
the study of the evolution of planetary nebulae with binary central stars as
current evolutionary theories predict that the binary plane should be aligned
perpendicular to the symmetry axis of the nebula.
  Deep narrowband imaging in the light of [NII], [OIII] and [SII], obtained
using ACAM on the William Herschel Telescope, has been used to investigate the
ionisation structure of Abell 41. Longslit observations of the H-alpha and
[NII] emission were obtained using the Manchester Echelle Spectrometer on the
2.1-m San Pedro M\'artir Telescope. These spectra, combined with the narrowband
imagery, were used to develop a spatio-kinematical model of [NII] emission from
Abell 41. The best fitting model reveals Abell 41 to have a waisted, bipolar
structure with an expansion velocity of ~40km\s at the waist. The symmetry axis
of the model nebula is within 5$\degr$ of perpendicular to the orbital plane of
the central binary system. This provides strong evidence that the close-binary
system, MT Ser, has directly affected the shaping of its nebula, Abell 41.
  Although the theoretical link between bipolar planetary nebulae and binary
central stars is long established, this nebula is only the second to have this
link, between nebular symmetry axis and binary plane, proved observationally.

multiple antennas at the sender, intended receiver and eavesdropper. The
associated channel matrices are fixed and known to all the terminals. A
computable characterization of the secrecy capacity is established as the
saddle point solution to a minimax problem. The converse is based on a
Sato-type argument used in other broadcast settings, and the coding theorem is
based on Gaussian wiretap codebooks.
  At high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the secrecy capacity is shown to be
attained by simultaneously diagonalizing the channel matrices via the
generalized singular value decomposition, and independently coding across the
resulting parallel channels. The associated capacity is expressed in terms of
the corresponding generalized singular values. It is shown that a semi-blind
""masked"" multi-input multi-output (MIMO) transmission strategy that sends
information along directions in which there is gain to the intended receiver,
and synthetic noise along directions in which there is not, can be arbitrarily
far from capacity in this regime.
  Necessary and sufficient conditions for the secrecy capacity to be zero are
provided, which simplify in the limit of many antennas when the entries of the
channel matrices are independent and identically distributed. The resulting
scaling laws establish that to prevent secure communication, the eavesdropper
needs 3 times as many antennas as the sender and intended receiver have
jointly, and that the optimimum division of antennas between sender and
intended receiver is in the ratio of 2:1.

detection have been performed on oriented Ag-104(g,m) nuclei with the NICOLE
He-3-He-4 dilution refrigerator setup at ISOLDE/CERN. For Ag-104(g) (I-pi =

Combining this result with the known magnetic moment for this isotope, the
magnetic hyperfine field of Ag impurities in an Fe host at low temperature (< 1
K) is found to be vertical bar B-hf(AgFe)vertical bar = 44.709(35) T. A
detailed analysis of other relevant data available in the literature yields
three more values for this hyperfine field. Averaging all four values yields a
new and precise value for the hyperfine field of Ag in Fe; that is, vertical
bar B-hf(AgFe)vertical bar = 44.692(30) T. For Ag-104(m) (I-pi = 2(+)), the
anisotropy of the beta particles provided the NMR/ON resonance signal at nu =
627.7(4) MHz. Using the new value for the hyperfine field of Ag in Fe, this
frequency corresponds to the magnetic moment mu(Ag-104m) = +3.691(3) mu(N),
which is significantly more precise than previous results. The magnetic moments
of the even-A Ag102 -110 isotopes are discussed in view of the competition
between the (pi g(9/2))(7/2+)(-3)(nu d(5/2)nu g(7/2))(5/2+) and the (pi
g(9/2))(9/2+)(-3)(nu d(5/2)nu g(7/2))(5/2+) configurations. The magnetic
moments of the ground and isomeric states of Ag-104 can be explained by an
almost complete mixing of these two configurations.

completely in terms of the renormalization group (RG) functions when using the
Coleman-Weinberg (CW) renormalization scheme, we first sum leading-log (LL)
contributions to $V$ using the one loop RG functions, associated with five
couplings (the top quark Yukawa coupling $x$, the quartic coupling of the Higgs
field $y$, the SU(3) gauge coupling $z$, and the $SU(2) \times U(1)$ couplings
$r$ and $s$). We then employ the two loop RG functions with the three couplings

then the three to five loop RG functions with one coupling $y$ to sum all the
$N^2LL...N^4LL$ contributions to $V$. In order to compute these sums, it is
necessary to convert those RG functions that have been originally computed
explicitly in the minimal subtraction (MS) scheme to their form in the CW
scheme. The Higgs mass can then be determined from the effective potential: the
$LL$ result is $m_{H}=219\;GeV/c^2$ decreases to $m_{H}=188\;GeV/c^2$ at
$N^{2}LL$ order and $m_{H}=163\;GeV/c^2$ at $N^{4}LL$ order. No reasonable
estimate of $m_H$ can be made at orders $V_{NLL}$ or $V_{N^3LL}$. This is taken
to be an indication that this mechanism for spontaneous symmetry breaking is in
fact viable, though one in which there is slow convergence towards the actual
value of $m_H$. The mass $163\;GeV/c^2$ is argued to be an upper bound on
$m_H$.

investigations, however, have revealed that the true nature of SNe Ia is more
complicated. Theoretically, it has been suggested that the initial
thermonuclear sparks are ignited at an offset from the centre of the
white-dwarf (WD) progenitor, possibly as a result of convection before the
explosion. Observationally, the diversity seen in the spectral evolution of SNe
Ia beyond the luminosity decline-rate relation is an unresolved issue. Here we
report that the spectral diversity is a consequence of random directions from
which an asymmetric explosion is viewed. Our findings suggest that the spectral
evolution diversity is no longer a concern in using SNe Ia as cosmological
standard candles. Furthermore, this indicates that ignition at an offset from

distributions in the ""variable flavor number factorization scheme"" (VFNS) as
well, where also the heavy quark flavors (c,b,t) become massless partons within
the nucleon. Only within the VFNS are NNLO calculations feasible at present,
since the required partonic subprocesses are available only in the
approximation of massless initial-state partons. The NNLO predictions for gauge
boson production are typically larger (by more than 1 sigma) than the NLO ones,
and rates at LHC energies can be predicted with an accuracy of about 5%,
whereas at Tevatron they are more than 2 sigma above the NLO ones. The NNLO

reveal detectable Stokes V Zeeman signatures in Least-Squares Deconvolved mean
line profiles in one-third of the observed sample of more than 30 stars. The
signatures are sometimes complex, revealing multiple reversals across the line.
The corresponding longitudinal magnetic field is seldom detected, although our
longitudinal field error bars are typically 0.3 G ($1\sigma$). These
characteristics suggest topologically complex magnetic fields, presumably
generated by dynamo action. The Stokes V signatures of some targets show clear
time variability, indicating either rotational modulation or intrinsic
evolution of the magnetic field. We also observe a weak correlation between the
unsigned longitudinal magnetic field and the CaII K core emission equivalent
width of the active G2Iab supergiant $\beta$~Dra and the G8Ib supergiant
$\epsilon$~Gem.

experimentally hard instances of the notoriously difficult graph isomorphism
problem. In this paper, we study the computational complexity of isomorphism
testing for line graphs of $t$-$(v,k,\lambda)$ designs. For this class of
highly regular graphs, we obtain a worst-case running time of $O(v^{\log v +
O(1)})$ for bounded parameters $t,k,\lambda$. In a first step, our approach
makes use of the Babai--Luks algorithm to compute canonical forms of
$t$-designs. In a second step, we show that $t$-designs can be reconstructed
from their line graphs in polynomial-time. The first is algebraic in nature,
the second purely combinatorial. For both, profound structural knowledge in
design theory is required. Our results extend earlier complexity results about
isomorphism testing of graphs generated from Steiner triple systems and block
designs.

the momenta of the scalar field of the Brans-Dicke theory and the scale factor
of the FRW metric. This special choice of deformation includes linearly a
deformation parameter. We trace the deformation footprints in the cosmological
equations of motion when the BD coupling parameter goes to infinity. One class
of the solutions gives a constant scale factor in the late time that confirms
the previous result obtained via another approach in the literature. This
effect can be interpreted as a quantum gravity footprint in the coarse grained
explanation. The another class of the solutions removes the big bang
singularity, and the accelerating expansion region has an infinite temporal
range which overcomes the horizon problem. After this epoch, there is a
graceful exiting by which the universe enters in the radiation dominated era.

collaboration at the Tevatron collider we discuss the implications of large CP
violation in $B_{d,s}$ mixing for Supersymmetric (SUSY) Standard Models,
focussing on those models which allow a family symmetry and unification. For
the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) we show that it is only
possible to account for $B_{s}$ mixing and CP violation at the expense of large
squark mixing which would require a new approach to family symmetry models. In
order to describe both $B_{s}$ and $B_{d}$ mixing and CP violation we are led
to consider SUSY models with Higgs fields transforming as triplets under a
family symmetry. We describe a realistic such model based on $\Delta_{27}$
family symmetry in which tree-level exchange of the second Higgs family
predicts $B_{s}$ and $B_{d}$ mixing and CP violation in good agreement with a
recent global fit, while naturally suppressing flavour and CP violation
involving the first and second quark and lepton families.
