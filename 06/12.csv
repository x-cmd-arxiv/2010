description in terms of a proximity to Mott localization. Since the parent
compounds of the iron pnictides contain an even number of 3d-electrons per Fe,
it is important to determine whether a Mott transition robustly exists and the
nature of the possible Mott insulating phases. We address these issues in a
minimal two-orbital model and a more realistic four-orbital model for the
parent iron pnictides using a slave-spin approach. In the two-orbital model
with two electrons per Fe, we identify a transition from metal to Mott
insulator. The critical coupling, $U_c$, is greatly reduced by the Hund's
coupling. Depending on the ratio between the inter- and intra-orbital Coulomb
repulsions, the insulating state can be either a spin-Mott insulator or an
orbital-Mott insulator. In the four-orbital model with four electrons per Fe,
we find an orbitally selective metal-to-insulator transition in the case of
zero Hund's coupling; the transition to a Mott insulator in the $xz$ and $yz$
orbitals takes place at the same critical coupling as the transition to a band
insulator in the $xy$ and $x^2-y^2$ orbitals. In the presence of a finite
Hund's coupling, however, the localization transition is into a spin-Mott
state.

anti-nu decay with a sensitivity of 10^-12 per event. This is done by using the
decay - in - flight technique which allows a signal acceptance of ~10% . The
aim is to collect about 100 signal events in two years of data taking with a
background to signal ratio smaller than 10%. The principle of the experimental
measurement and the layout of the detector are presented. During 2007/2008 a
dedicated run devoted to NA62 prototype tests and study of K_e2 decays was
taken. The first phase of the NA62 experiment is aiming at a high precision
test of the lepton universality by measuring the helicity suppressed ratio R_K.
The preliminary result based on 40% of the 2007 NA62 data sample, R_K =
K_e2/K_mu2 = (2.500 +/- 0.016) x 10^-5, which is the first result with a
precision better than 1%, is consistent with the Standard Model.
  Aiming at charge asymmetry measurements, the NA48/2 experiment collected an
unprecedented amount of charged K_(3 pi) events. The large samples allowed a
precision measurement of rare charged kaon decays. New measurements of the
K+/-_(pi l l) decays based on the full NA48/2 data sample collected during
2003/2004 are reported in this paper. Samples of about 7200 reconstructed K+/-
-> pi+/- e+ e- events, and more than 3000 K+/- -> pi+/- mu+ mu- events, with a
few percent background contamination, have been collected. A precise
measurement of the branching fractions and the form factors of the rare decays
K+/-_(pi l l)$ were performed. Measurements of the CP-violating and the
forward-backward asymmetries are reported.

flowing collisionless plasma is investigated by using the linearized kinetic
equation for plasma ions with a point-sink term accounting for ion absorption
on the object. The effect of absorption on the attractive part of the grain
potential is investigated. For subthermal ion flows, the attractive part of the
grain potential in the direction perpendicular to the ion flow can be
significantly reduced or completely destroyed, depending on the absorption
rate. For superthermal ion flows, however, the effect of absorption on the
grain attraction in the direction perpendicular to the ion flow is shown to be
exponentially weak. It is thus argued that, in the limit of superthermal ion
flow, the effect of absorption on the grain shielding potential can be safely
ignored for typical grain sizes relevant to complex plasmas.

matter power spectrum on large scales may still be visible and above the white
noise for about one decade. We show, that the Kaiser biasing scheme which leads
to linear bias of the correlation function on {\em large} scales, also
generates a linear bias of the {\rm power spectrum} on rather small scales.
This is a consequence of the divergence on small scales of the pure
Harrison-Zeldovich spectrum. However, biasing becomes k-dependent when we damp
the underlying power spectrum on small scales. We also discuss the effect of
biasing on the baryon acoustic oscillations.

distribution function is positive. In this paper we derive a criterion that
holds for all spherical systems in which the augmented density is a separable

rays. Particular field configurations supported by different astrophysical
objects may be observable in cosmic ray maps. We consider a simple
configuration, a constant azimuthal field in a disk-like object, that we
identify as a cosmic magnetic lens. Such configuration is typical in most
spiral galaxies, and we assume that it can also appear at smaller or larger
scales. We show that the magnetic lens deflects cosmic rays in a regular
geometrical pattern, very much like a gravitational lens deflects light but
with some interesting differences. In particular, the lens acts effectively
only in a definite region of the cosmic-ray spectrum, and it can be convergent
or divergent depending on the (clockwise or counterclockwise) direction of the
magnetic field and the (positive or negative) electric charge of the cosmic
ray. We find that the image of a point-like monochromatic source may be one,
two or four points depending on the relative position of source, observer and
center of the lens. For a perfect alignment and a lens in the orthogonal plane
the image becomes a ring. We also show that the presence of a lens could
introduce low-scale fluctuations and matter-antimatter asymmetries in the
fluxes from distant sources. The concept of cosmic magnetic lens that we
introduce here may be useful in the interpretation of possible patterns
observed in the cosmic ray flux at different energies.

in the Fermi sea. The proposed hole core is a small region of the Brillouin
zone (usually at the center of the zone) where the lowest energy states in the
normal state reside. We propose that in the superconducting state these energy
states become {\it singly occupied} with electrons of a definite spin helicity.
In other words, that holes of a definite spin helicity condense from the top to
the bottom of the band in the transition to superconductivity, and electrons of
that spin helicity `float' on top of the hole core, thus becoming highly
mobile. The hole core has radius $q_0=1/2\lambda_L$, with $\lambda_L$ the
London penetration depth, and the electrons expelled from the hole core give an
excess negative charge density within a London penetration depth of the real
space surface of the superconductor. The hole core explains the development of
a spin current in the transition to superconductivity (Spin Meissner effect)
and the associated negative charge expulsion from the interior of metals in the
transition to superconductivity, effects we have proposed in earlier work to
exist in all superconductors and to be at the root of the Meissner effect.

and dense matter, being especially useful at densities found in compact stars
and protoneutron star matter. Using the MSbar one-loop effective potential, we
compute quantities that are relevant in the process of nucleation of droplets
of quark matter in this scenario. In particular, we show that the model
predicts a surface tension of \Sigma ~ 5-15 MeV/fm^2, rendering nucleation of
quark matter possible during the early post-bounce stage of core collapse
supernovae. Including temperature effects and vacuum logarithmic corrections,
we find a clear competition between these features in characterizing the
dynamics of the chiral phase conversion, so that if the temperature is low
enough the consistent inclusion of vacuum corrections could help preventing the
nucleation of quark matter during the collapse process. We also discuss the
first interaction corrections that come about at two-loop order.

linearly polarized. The subset of homogeneous solutions to this Gowdy model are
vacuum Bianchi I spacetimes with a three-torus topology. We deepen the analysis
of the loop quantization of these Bianchi I universes adopting the improved

revisit the hybrid quantization of the Gowdy $T^3$ cosmologies by combining
this loop quantum cosmology description with a Fock quantization of the
inhomogeneities over the homogeneous Bianchi I background. We show that, in
vacuo, the Hamiltonian constraint of both the Bianchi I and the Gowdy models
can be regarded as an evolution equation with respect to the volume of the
Bianchi I universe. This evolution variable turns out to be discrete, with a
strictly positive minimum. Furthermore, we argue that this evolution is
well-defined inasmuch as the associated initial value problem is well posed:
physical solutions are completely determined by the data on an initial section
of constant Bianchi I volume. This fact allows us to carry out to completion
the quantization of these two cosmological models.

define a simple and natural conformal restriction property that is
conjecturally satisfied by the scaling limits of interfaces in models from
statistical physics. This property is basically the combination of conformal
invariance and the locality of the interaction in the model. Unlike the Markov
property that Schramm used to characterize SLE curves (which involves
conditioning on partially generated interfaces up to arbitrary stopping times),
this property only involves conditioning on entire loops and thus appears at
first glance to be weaker.
  Our first main result is that there exists exactly a one-dimensional family
of random loop collections with this property---one for each k in (8/3,4]---and
that the loops are forms of SLE(k). The proof proceeds in two steps. First,
uniqueness is established by showing that every such loop ensemble can be
generated by an ""exploration"" process based on SLE.
  Second, existence is obtained using the two-dimensional Brownian loop-soup,
which is a Poissonian random collection of loops in a planar domain. When the
intensity parameter c of the loop-soup is less than 1, we show that the outer
boundaries of the loop clusters are disjoint simple loops (when c>1 there is

the survey, we observed 124 M dwarfs of integrated spectral types M0-M6 and
identified 34 new and 17 previously known companions to 44 stars. We derived
relative astrometry and component photometry for these systems. More than half
of the binaries have separations smaller than 1 arcsec and would have been
missed in a simply seeing-limited survey. Correcting our sample for selection
effects yields a multiplicity fraction of 32+/-6% for 108 M dwarfs within 52 pc
and with angular separations of 0.1-6.0 arcsec, corresponding to projected
separation 3-180 AU at median distance 30 pc. Compared to early-type M dwarfs
(M>0.3M_Sun), later type (and hence lower mass) M dwarf binaries appear to have
closer separations, and more similar masses.

mostly focusing on the development of pairing correlations from attractive
interactions. Using renormalization group we identify a large number of fixed
points and show that they correspond to resonant scattering in multiple
channels. Pairing resonances in finite-density band insulators occur between
quasiparticles and quasiholes living at different symmetry-related wavevectors
in the Brillouin zone. This allows a BCS-BEC crossover interpretation of both
Cooper and particle-hole pairing. We show that in two dimensions the run-away
flows of relevant attractive interactions lead to charged-boson-dominated low
energy dynamics in the insulating states, and superfluid transitions in bosonic
mean-field or XY universality classes. Analogous phenomena in higher dimensions
are restricted to the strong coupling limit, while at weak couplings the
transition is in the pair-breaking BCS class. The models discussed here can be
realized with ultra-cold gases of alkali atoms tuned to a broad Feshbach
resonance in an optical lattice, enabling experimental studies of pairing
correlations in insulators, especially in their universal regimes. In turn,
these simple and tractable models capture the emergence of fluctuation-driven
superconducting transitions in fermionic systems, which is of interest in the
context of high temperature superconductors.

user scheduling strategy is utilized in $K$-cell uplink networks with
time-invariant channel coefficients and base stations (BSs) having $M$

minimum interference to the other BSs. Two OIM protocols are shown according to
the number $S$ of simultaneously transmitting users per cell: opportunistic
interference nulling (OIN) and opportunistic interference alignment (OIA).
Then, their performance is analyzed in terms of degrees-of-freedom (DoFs). As
our main result, it is shown that $KM$ DoFs are achievable under the OIN
protocol with $M$ selected users per cell, if the total number $N$ of users in
a cell scales at least as $\text{SNR}^{(K-1)M}$. Similarly, it turns out that
the OIA scheme with $S$($<M$) selected users achieves $KS$ DoFs, if $N$ scales
faster than $\text{SNR}^{(K-1)S}$. These results indicate that there exists a
trade-off between the achievable DoFs and the minimum required $N$. By deriving
the corresponding upper bound on the DoFs, it is shown that the OIN scheme is
DoF optimal. Finally, numerical evaluation, a two-step scheduling method, and
the extension to multi-carrier scenarios are shown.

The inner regions are characterized by a steep [Z/H] gradient and high
[alpha/Fe] at ~2.5 times solar value. In the halo, between 18 and 60 kpc, the
[Z/H] is near-solar with a shallow gradient, while [alpha/Fe] shows a strong
negative gradient, reaching solar values at ~60 kpc. We interpret these data in
terms of different formation histories for both components. The data for the
inner galaxy are consistent with a rapid, quasi-monolithic, dissipative merger
origin at early redshifts, followed by one or at most a few dry mergers. Those
for the halo argue for later accretion of stars from old systems with more
extended star formation histories. The half-light radius of the inner component
alone is estimated as ~6 kpc, suggesting a significantly smaller size of this

additional radial velocity data obtained with UVES/VLT between 2007 and 2010,
which significantly improve the orbit of the system. The combined data set
spans ten years of radial velocity monitoring for ChaHa8. A Kepler fit to the
data yields an orbital period of 5.2 yrs, an eccentricity of 0.59, and a radial
velocity semi-amplitude of 2.4 km/s. A companion mass M2sini (which is a lower
limit due to the unknown orbital inclination) of 25 Mjup and of 31 Mjup is
derived when using model-dependent mass estimates for the primary of 0.07 and
0.10 Msun, resp. Assuming random orientation of orbits in space, we find a very
high probability that the companion of Chaha8 is of substellar nature: With a
greater than 87% probability, the companion mass is between 30 and 69 Mjup and
the mass ratio < 0.7. The absence of any evidence of the companion in the
cross-correlation function together with the size of the radial velocity
amplitude also indicate a mass ratio of at most 0.7, and likely smaller.
Furthermore, the new data exclude the possibility that the companion has a mass
in the planetary regime (<13 Mjup). We show that the companion contributes
significantly to the total luminosity of the system: model-dependent estimates
provide a minimum luminosity ratio L2/L1 of 0.2. ChaHa8 is the 4th known
spectroscopic brown dwarf or very low-mass stellar binary with determined
orbital parameters, and the 2nd known very young one. With an age of only ~3
Myr it is of particular interest to very low-mass formation and evolution
theories. In contrast to most other spectroscopic binaries, it has a relatively
long period and it might be possible to determine the astrometric orbit of the
primary and, thus, the orbital inclination.

particle acceleration, pair creation and screening of the electric field are
calculated simultaneously - and apply it to model the Ruderman and Sutherland
cascade in one dimension. I find that pair creation is quite regular and
quasi-periodic. In each cycle a blob of ultrarelativistic electron-positron
plasma is generated, it propagates into the magnetosphere leaving a tail of
less relativistic plasma behind, and the next discharge occurs when this mildly
relativistic plasma leaves the polar cap. A short burst of pair formation is
followed by a longer quiet phase when accelerating electric field is screened
and no pairs are produced. Some of freshly injected electron-positrons pairs
get trapped in plasma oscillations creating a population of low energy
particles. The cascade easily adjusts to the current density required by the
pulsar magnetosphere by reversing some of the low energy particles. Each
discharge generates a strong coherent superluminal electrostatic wave, which
may be relevant for the problem of pulsar radioemission.

disordered Bose-Hubbard model within a renormalization group analysis of the
replica field theory obtained by a strong-coupling expansion around the atomic
limit. We identify a new order parameter and associated correlation length
scale that is capable of capturing the transition from a state with zero
compressibility, the Mott insulator, to one in which the compressibility is
finite, the Bose glass. The order parameter is the relative variance of the
disorder-induced mass distribution. In the Mott insulator, the relative
variance renormalizes to zero, whereas it diverges in the Bose glass. The
divergence of the relative variance signals the breakdown of self-averaging.
The length scale governing the breakdown of self-averaging is the distance
between rare regions. This length scale is finite in the Bose glass but
diverges at the transition to the Mott insulator with an exponent of $\nu=1/D$
for incommensurate fillings. Likewise, the compressibility vanishes with an
exponent of $\gamma=4/D-1$ at the transition. At commensurate fillings, the
transition is controlled by a different fixed point at which both the disorder
and interaction vertices are relevant.

the collapse of the pseudogap, briefly reviewed here, at a critical point and
the subsequent onset of the strange-metal characterized by a resistivity that
scales linearly with temperature. A possible clue to the resolution of this
problem is the inter-relation between two facts: 1) A robust theory of T-linear
resistivity resulting from quantum criticality requires an additional length
scale outside the standard 1-parameter scaling scenario and 2) breaking the
Landau correspondence between the Fermi gas and an interacting system with
short-range repulsions requires non-fermionic degrees. We show that a
low-energy theory of the Hubbard model which correctly incorporates dynamical
spectral weight transfer has the extra degrees of freedom needed to describe
this physics. The degrees of freedom that mix into the lower band as a result
of dynamical spectral weight transfer are shown to either decouple beyond a
critical doping, thereby signaling Mottness collapse or unbind above a critical
temperature yielding strange metal behaviour characterised by $T-$linear
resistivity.

such as accreting black holes and neutron stars, pulsars, and relativistic

calculations it is assumed that the electrons have isotropic angular
distribution in some frame. However, there are situations where the anisotropy
may be significant due to the bulk motions, or anisotropic cooling by
synchrotron radiation, or anisotropic source of seed soft photons. We develop
here an analytical theory of Compton scattering by anisotropic distribution of
electrons that can simplify significantly the calculations. Assuming that the
electron angular distribution can be represented by a second order polynomial
over cosine of some angle (dipole and quadrupole anisotropy), we integrate the
exact Klein-Nishina cross-section over the angles. Exact analytical and
approximate formulae valid for any photon and electron energies are derived for
the redistribution functions describing Compton scattering of photons with
arbitrary angular distribution by anisotropic electrons. The analytical
expressions for the corresponding photon scattering cross-section on such
electrons as well as the mean energy of scattered photons, its dispersion and
radiation pressure force are also derived. We applied the developed formalism
to the accurate calculations of the thermal and kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich

The two pairs of lobes, angularly separated by ~22 degrees, were ejected
simultaneously approx. ~3500-5000 years ago, at the adopted distance range from
3.5 to 5.0 kpc. The larger lobes show evidence of a slight degree of point
symmetry. The shaping of the nebula could be explained by wind interaction in a
system consisting of a post-AGB star surrounded by a disc warped by radiative
instabilities. This requires the system to be a close binary or a single star
which engulfed a planet as it died. On the other hand, we present broad- and
narrow-band images and a low S/N optical spectrum of the highly-reddened,

focusing on the decentralized model, where the coin operation is allowed to
change with the vertex of the graph. When the coin operations can be modified
at every time step, these systems can be looked at as control systems and
techniques of geometric control theory can be applied. In particular, the set
of states that one can achieve can be described by studying controllability.
Extending previous results, we give a characterization of the set of reachable
states in terms of an appropriate Lie algebra. We then prove general results
and criteria relating controllability to the algebraic and topological
properties of the walk. As a consequence of these results, we prove that if the
degree of the underlying graph is larger than $\frac{N}{2}$, where $N$ is the
number of nodes, the quantum walk is always completely controllable, i.e., it
is possible to having it to evolve according to an arbitrary unitary evolution.
Another result is that controllability for decentralized models only depends on
the graph and not on the particular quantum walk defined on it. We also provide
explicit algorithms for control and quantify the number of steps needed for an
arbitrary state transfer. The results of the paper are of interest in quantum
information theory where quantum walks are used and analyzed in the development
of quantum algorithms.

gas must have been enriched before the visible quasar phase. These results for
high quasar metallicities, regardless of L_FIR, are consistent with evolution
scenarios wherein visibly bright quasars appear after the main episode(s) of

of all tables of non-negative real numbers satisfying certain summation
conditions. Transportation problems are, in many ways, the simplest kind of
linear programs and thus have a rich combinatorial structure. First, we give
new results on the diameters of certain classes of transportation polytopes and
their relation to the Hirsch Conjecture, which asserts that the diameter of
every $d$-dimensional convex polytope with $n$ facets is bounded above by
$n-d$. In particular, we prove a new quadratic upper bound on the diameter of
$3$-way axial transportation polytopes defined by $1$-marginals. We also show
that the Hirsch Conjecture holds for $p \times 2$ classical transportation
polytopes, but that there are infinitely-many Hirsch-sharp classical
transportation polytopes. Second, we present new results on subpolytopes of
transportation polytopes. We investigate, for example, a non-regular
triangulation of a subpolytope of the fourth Birkhoff polytope $B_4$. This
implies the existence of non-regular triangulations of all Birkhoff polytopes
$B_n$ for $n \geq 4$. We also study certain classes of network flow polytopes

detecting network codes to ensure that fault-free nodes will never disagree,
and routing scheme that is adaptive to the result of error detection. Our
algorithm has a bit complexity of n(n-1)l/(n-t), which leads to a linear cost
(O(n)) per bit agreed upon, and overcomes the quadratic lower bound

achieved in the literature by allowing a positive probability of error. Our

of this process in nature (on a 6.4 sigma level), with the largest half-life
ever observed for a nuclear decay process (2.2 x 10^{25} y). This has
fundamental consequences for particle physics - violation of lepton number,
Majorana nature of the neutrino. These results are independent of any

restrictions for SUSY theories, sneutrino mass, right-handed W-boson mass,
superheavy neutrino masses, compositeness, leptoquarks, violation of Lorentz
invariance and equivalence principle in the neutrino sector. The masses of
light-neutrinos are found to be degenerate, and to be at least 0.22 +- 0.02 eV.

weakly dissipative, one-dimensional planar, strongly anisotropic and dispersive
plasma is investigated. The magnetic configuration consists of an inhomogeneous
magnetic slab sandwiched between two regions of semi-infinite homogeneous
magnetic plasmas. Laterally driven FMA waves penetrate the inhomogeneous slab
interacting with the localised slow or Alfven waves present in the
inhomogeneous layer and are partly reflected, dissipated and transmitted by
this region. The presented research aims to find the coefficient of wave energy
absorption under solar chromospheric and coronal conditions. Numerical results
are analyzed to find the coefficient of wave energy absorption at both the slow
and Alfven resonance positions. The mathematical derivations are based on the
two simplifying assumptions that (i) nonlinearity is weak, and (ii) the
thickness of the inhomogeneous layer is small in comparison to the wavelength
of the wave, i.e. we employ the so-called long wavelength approximation. Slow
resonance is found to be described by the nonlinear theory, while the dynamics
at the Alfven resonance can be described within the linear framework. We
introduce a new concept of coupled resonances, which occurs when two different
resonances are in close proximity to each other, causing the incoming wave to
act as though it has been influenced by the two resonances simultaneously. Our
results show that the wave energy absorption is heavily dependent on the angle
of the incident wave in combination with the inclination angle of the
equilibrium magnetic field. In addition, it is found that FMA waves are very
efficiently absorbed at the Alfven resonance under coronal conditions. Under
chromospheric conditions the FMA waves are far less efficiently absorbed,
despite an increase in efficiency due to the coupled resonances.

deviation is further investigated by sub-1 K measurements of a device, which
has one tunnel junction connected to four arrays consisting of N junctions (N =
41, junction diameter 700 nm). The differential conductance is measured in
single-junction and array Coulomb blockade thermometer operation modes. By
fitting the experimental data to the theoretical models we found an upper limit
for the local tunnel junction resistance deviation of ~5 % for the array of
2N+1 junctions. This value is of the same order as the minimum detectable
deviation defined by the accuracy of our experimental setup.

jet advances, the density around the head of the jet decreases, and its Lorentz
factor reaches as high as 200 at the photosphere and 400 inside the
photosphere. For an on-axis observer, the photosphere appears concave shaped
due to the low density and high beaming factor of the jet. The luminosity
varies because of the abrupt change in the position of the photosphere due to
the internal structure of the jet. Comparing our results with GRB090902B, the
flux level of the thermal-like component is similar to our model, although the
peak energy looks a little bit higher (but still within a factor of 2). From
the comparison, we estimate that the bulk Lorentz factor of GRB090902B is
$\Gamma \sim 2.4 \times 10^2 (r/10^{12} \rm cm$) where $r$ is the radius of the

off-axis observer. There is a time lag of a few seconds for high energy bands

emission seen in GRB080916C. The spectrum below the peak energy is a power law
and the index is $2.3 \sim 2.6$ which is softer than that of single temperature
plank distribution but still harder than that of typical value of observed one.

is a $p$-norm and $1 < p < 2$, interpolation is always possible when the points
are all different and there are at least two of them. We then show that
interpolation is not always possible when $p > 2$. Specifically, for every $p >
2$, we construct a set of different points in some $\Rd$ for which the
interpolation matrix is singular.
  The greater part of this work investigates the sensitivity of radial basis
function interpolants to changes in the function values at the interpolation
points. Our early results show that it is possible to recast the work of Ball,
Narcowich and Ward in the language of distributional Fourier transforms in an
elegant way. We then use this language to study the interpolation matrices
generated by subsets of regular grids. In particular, we are able to extend the
classical theory of Toeplitz operators to calculate sharp bounds on the spectra
of such matrices.
  Applying our understanding of these spectra, we construct preconditioners for
the conjugate gradient solution of the interpolation equations. Our main result
is that the number of steps required to achieve solution of the linear system
to within a required tolerance can be independent of the number of
interpolation points. The Toeplitz structure allows us to use fast Fourier
transform techniques, which imp lies that the total number of operations is a
multiple of $n \log n$, where $n$ is the number of interpolation points.
  Finally, we use some of our methods to study the behaviour of the
multiquadric when its shape parameter increases to infinity. We find a
surprising link with the {\it sinus cardinalis} or {\it sinc} function of
Whittaker. Consequently, it can be highly useful to use a large shape parameter
when approximating band-limited functions.

A notion of constant change is introduced that in certain situations allows the

accreting matter the difference in area between the two different horizons can
be many orders of magnitude larger than the Planck area. When the black hole is
evaporating the difference is small on the Planck scale. A model is introduced
that shows how trapping horizons can be expected to appear outside the event
horizon before the black hole starts to evaporate. Finally a modified
definition is introduced to invariantly define the location of the trapping
horizon under a conformal transformation. In this case the trapping horizon is
not always a marginally outer trapped surface.

discovery of 5 Type II Cepheids in NGC 5128. The distance to that comparatively
unreddened population is d=3.8+-0.4(se) Mpc. The classical Cepheids in NGC 5128
are the most obscured in the extragalactic sample (n=30) surveyed, whereas
groups of Cepheids tied to several SNe host galaxies feature negative
reddenings. Adopting an anomalous extinction law for Cepheids in NGC 5128 owing
to observations of SN 1986G (Rv~2.4) is not favoured, granted SNe Ia may follow
small Rv. The distances to classical Cepheids in NGC 5128 exhibit a dependence
on colour and CCD chip, which may arise in part from photometric contamination.
Applying a colour cut to mitigate contamination yields d~3.5 Mpc (V-I<1.3),
while the entire sample's mean is d~3.1 Mpc. The distance was established via
the latest VI Galactic Wesenheit functions that include the 10 HST calibrators,
and which imply a shorter distance scale than Sandage et al.2004 by ~>10% at
P~25d. HST monitored classical Cepheids in NGC 5128, and the SNe hosts NGC 3021
& NGC 1309, follow a shallower VI Wesenheit slope than ground-based
calibrations of the Milky Way, LMC, NGC 6822, SMC, and IC 1613. The discrepancy
is unrelated to metallicity since the latter group share a common slope over a
sizeable abundance baseline (a=-3.34+-0.08,d[Fe/H]~1). A negligible distance
offset between OGLE Cepheids and RR Lyr variables in the LMC, SMC, and IC 1613
bolsters assertions that VI-based Wesenheit functions are relatively
insensitive to chemical abundance. In sum, a metallicity effect (VI) is not the
chief source of uncertainty associated with the Cepheid distance to NGC 5128 or
the establishment of Hubble's constant, but rather it may be the admittedly
challenging task of obtaining precise, commonly standardized, multiepoch,
multiband, comparatively uncontaminated extragalactic Cepheid photometry.

The main improvements are related to the suppression of systematic effects
which strongly limit sensitivity in the region of the Galactic Plane (GP),
especially in the crowded field of the Galactic Center (GC). We extended the
IBIS/ISGRI background model to take into account the Galactic Ridge X-ray

sky image we applied nonparametric sky image filtering based on wavelet
decomposition. The implemented modifications of the sky reconstruction method
decrease the systematic noise in the ~20 Ms deep field of GC by ~44%, and
practically remove it from the high-latitude sky images. New observational data
sets, along with an improved reconstruction algorithm, allow us to conduct the
hard X-ray survey with the best currently available minimal sensitivity 3.7E-12

We predict that black holes come in form of a discrete tower with well defined

spontaneous particle emissions, with each transition reducing the horizon area
by strictly integer number of Planck units. Quantization of the horizons can be
a crucial missing link by which the notion of the minimal length in gravity

surface-brightness moments of small and noisy galaxy images. We identify three
potentially problematic assumptions. These are: (1) While gravitational shear
must be estimated from averaged galaxy images, KSB derives a shear estimate
from each individual image and then takes the average. Since the two operations
do not commute, KSB gives biased results. (2) KSB implicitly assumes that
galaxy ellipticities are small, while weak gravitational lensing assures only
that the change in ellipticity due to the shear is small. (3) KSB does not
invert the convolution with the point-spread function, but gives an approximate
PSF correction which - even for a circular PSF - holds only in the limit of
circular sources. The effects of assumptions (2) and (3) partially counter-act
in a way dependent on the width of the weight function and of the PSF. We
quantitatively demonstrate the biases due to all assumptions, extend the KSB
approach consistently to third order in the shear and ellipticity and show that
this extension lowers the biases substantially. The issue of proper PSF
deconvolution will be addressed in a forthcoming paper.

the VdW equation is appropriate at describing inter-nucleon forces, and discuss
how each parameter scales with $N_c$. We demonstrate that $N_c=3$ (our world)
is not large with respect to the other dimensionless scale relevant to baryonic
matter, the number of neighbors in a dense system $N_N$. Consequently, we show
that the liquid-gas phase transition looks dramatically different at $N_c \to
\infty$ with respect of our world: The critical point temperature becomes of
the order of $\lqcd$ rather than below it. The critical point density becomes
of the order of the baryonic density, rather than an order of magnitude below
it. These are precisely the characteristics usually associated with the
""Quarkyonic phase"". We therefore conjecture that quarkyonic matter is simply
the large $N_c$ limit of the nuclear liquid, and the interplay between $N_c$
and $N_N$ is the reason why the nuclear liquid in our world is so different
from quarkyonic matter. We conclude by suggesting ways our conjecture can be
tested in future lattice measurements.

representations that represent self-describing descriptions of resources, and
through the way how these resources are interlinked through the hyperlinks that
can be found in those representations. This basic design of RESTful services
means that for extracting the most useful information from a service, it is
necessary to understand a service's representations, which means both the
semantics in terms of describing a resource, and also its semantics in terms of
describing its linkage with other resources. Based on the Resource Linking
Language (ReLL), this paper describes a framework for how RESTful services can
be described, and how these descriptions can then be used to harvest
information from these services. Building on this framework, a layered model of
RESTful service semantics allows to represent a service's information in
RDF/OWL. Because REST is based on the linkage between resources, the same model
can be used for aggregating and interlinking multiple services for extracting
RDF data from sets of RESTful services.

flows to try to understand the nature of an 'edge' state. The latter is an
invariant set in phase space separating the basin of attraction B of the
laminar state into two parts distinguished from one another by the nature of
relaminarizing orbits. The model is parametrized by R, a stand-in for Reynolds
number. The origin is a stable equilibrium point for all values of R and
represents the laminar flow. The system possesses four critical parameter
values at which qualitative changes take place, R_{sn}, R_h, R_{bh} and
R_\infty. The origin is globally stable if R < R_{sn} but for R > R_{sn} has
two further equilibrium points, X_{lb} and X_{ub} . Of these X_{lb} is unstable
for all values of R > R_{sn} whereas X_{ub} is stable for R < R_{bh} and
therefore possesses its own basin of attraction D. At R = R_h a homoclinic
bifurcation takes place with the simultaneous formation of a homoclinic loop
and an edge state.
  For R_h < R < R_{bh} the edge state, which is the stable manifold of X_{lb},
forms part of \partial B, the boundary of the basin of attraction of the
origin. The other part of \partial B is a periodic orbit P bounding D. P and D
shrink with increasing R. At R = R_{bh} there is a 'backwards Hopf' bifurcation
at which X_{ub} loses its stability and P and D disappear. For R_{bh} < R <
R_\infty the edge is 'pure' in the sense that it is the only phase space
structure that lies outside the basin of attraction of the origin. As R
increases the point X_{lb} recedes to progressively greater distances, with a
singularity at R = R_\infty where it becomes infinite. For R > R_\infty X_{lb}
has reappeared, the edge state has disappeared, and the geometrical structure
favors permanent transition from the laminar state, increasingly so for
increasing values of R.
