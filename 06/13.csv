function bump in a sample of isolated dwarf galaxies in the Local Group. We
have designed a new analysis approach comparing the observed color-magnitude
diagrams with theoretical best-fit color-magnitude diagrams derived from
precise estimates of the star formation histories of each galaxy. This analysis
is based on studying the difference between the V-magnitude of the RGB bump and
the horizontal branch at the level of the RR Lyrae instability strip
(Delta_vhbb) and we discuss here a technique for reliably measuring this
quantity in complex stellar systems. By using this approach, we find that the
difference between the observed and predicted values of Delta_vhbb is +0.13 +/-
0.14 mag. This is smaller, by about a factor of two, than the well-known
discrepancy between theory and observation at low metallicity commonly derived
for Galactic globular clusters. This result is confirmed by a comparison
between the adopted theoretical framework and empirical estimates of the
Delta_vhbb parameter for both a large database of Galactic globular clusters
and for four other dSph galaxies for which this estimate is available in the
literature. We also investigate the strength of the red giant branch bump
feature (R_bump), and find very good agreement between the observed and
theoretically predicted R_bump values. This agreement supports the reliability
of the evolutionary lifetimes predicted by theoretical models of the evolution
of low-mass stars.

of noise or if it also includes other components. The main issue of this method
is to define a critical detection threshold that allows identification of a
component other than noise, when a peak in the periodogram exceeds it. In the
case of signals sampled on a regular time grid, determination of such a
threshold is relatively simple. When the sampling is uneven, however, things
are more complicated. The most popular solution in this case is to use the
""Lomb-Scargle"" periodogram, but this method can be used only when the noise is
the realization of a zero-mean, white (i.e. flat-spectrum) random process. In
this paper, we present a general formalism based on matrix algebra, which
permits analysis of the statistical properties of a periodogram independently
of the characteristics of noise (e.g. colored and/or non-stationary), as well
as the characteristics of sampling.

coupled dimer systems in an external magnetic field. We show that this phase
diagram is characterized by the presence of an extended Bose glass, not
accessible to mean-field approximation, and stemming from the localization of
two distinct species of bosonic quasiparticles appearing in the ground state.
On the one hand, non-magnetic impurities doped into the dimer-singlet phase of
a weakly coupled dimer system are known to free up local magnetic moments. The
deviations of these local moments from full polarization along the field can be
mapped onto a gas of bosonic quasiparticles, which undergo condensation in zero
and very weak magnetic fields, corresponding to transverse long-range
antiferromagnetic order. An increasing magnetic field lowers the density of
such quasiparticles to a critical value at which a quantum phase transition
occurs, corresponding to the quasiparticle localization on clusters of local
magnets (dimers, trimers, etc.) and to the onset of a Bose glass. Strong
finite-size quantum fluctuations hinder further depletion of quasiparticles
from such clusters, and thus lead to the appearance of pseudo-plateaus in the
magnetization curve of the system. On the other hand, site dilution hinders the
field-induced Bose-Einstein condensation of triplet quasiparticles on the
intact dimers, and it introduces instead a Bose glass of triplets. A thorough
numerical investigation of the phase diagram for a planar system of coupled
dimers shows that the two above-mentioned Bose glass phases are continuously
connected, and they overlap in a finite region of parameter space, thus
featuring a two-species Bose glass. The quantum phase transition from Bose
glass to magnetic order in two dimensions is marked by novel universal
exponents.

density increases and decreases with negligible changes in the solar wind
velocity. SCIFs occur irregularly at 1 AU, when plasma flows with specific
properties come to the Earth's orbit. SCIFs are usually observed in slow,
turbulent solar wind with increased density and interplanetary magnetic field
strength. The number of times SCIFs occur during a day is simulated using the
solar wind density, magnetic field, and their standard deviations as input
parameters for a period of 5 years. A correlation coefficient of ~0.7 is
obtained between the modelled and the experimental data. It is found that SCIFs
are not associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs), corotating interaction
regions (CIRs), or interplanetary shocks; however, 85% of the sector boundaries
are surrounded by SCIFs. The properties of the solar wind plasma for days with
5 or more SCIF observations are the same as those of the solar wind plasma at
the sector boundaries. One possible explanation for the occurrence of SCIFs
(near sector boundaries) is magnetic reconnection at the heliospheric current
sheet or local current sheets. Other probable causes of SCIFs (inside sectors)
are turbulent processes in the slow solar wind and at the crossings of flux

the dynamics of the SDE and the initial and endpoint conditions. The dynamics
of a SDE are governed by the deterministic term (drift) and the stochastic term
(noise). Instead of producing conditional paths directly from the original SDE,
one can consider a sequence of SDEs with modified drifts. The modified drifts
should be chosen so that it is easier to produce sample paths which satisfy the
initial and endpoint conditions. Also, the sequence of modified drifts
converges to the drift of the original SDE. We construct a simple Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm which samples, in sequence, conditional paths from
the modified SDEs, by taking the last sampled path at each level of the
sequence as an initial condition for the sampling at the next level in the
sequence. The algorithm can be thought of as a stochastic analog of
deterministic homotopy methods for solving nonlinear algebraic equations or as
a SDE generalization of simulated annealing. The algorithm is particularly
suited for filtering/smoothing applications. We show how it can be used to
improve the performance of particle filters. Numerical results for filtering of
a stochastic differential equation are included.

of the observed SEDs with the predictions of the COND and DUSTY models, for an

brown dwarfs, and enables the estimation of effective temperature, Teff. The
cluster members are then readily distinguishable from background stars by their
locations on a plot of flux density versus Teff. The range of estimated Teff
extends down to ~ 750 K, suggesting the presence of objects of sub-Jupiter
mass. The results also suggest that the mass function for the rho Oph cloud
resembles that of the sigma Orionis cluster based on a recent study, with both
rising towards lower masses. The other main result from our study is the
apparent presence of a progressive blueward skew in the distribution of J-H and

in the low state during the period of the $Fermi$/LAT operation. We also find
that III Zw 2 follows similar jet processes as those in $\gamma$-ray AGNs,

region explosive events are identified from profiles of C II 1037 Angstrom and
O VI 1032 Angstrom, respectively. We compare Ly-beta profiles during EEs with
those averaged in the entire quiet-Sun and coronal-hole regions. The
relationship between the peak emission of Ly-beta profiles and the wing
emission of C II and O VI during EEs is investigated. We find that the central
part of Ly-beta profiles becomes more reversed and the distance of the two
peaks becomes larger during EEs, both in the coronal hole and in the quiet Sun.
The average Ly-beta profile of the EEs detected by C II has an obvious stronger
blue peak. During EEs, there is a clear correlation between the increased peak
emission of Ly-beta profiles and the enhanced wing emission of the C II and O
VI lines. The correlation is more pronounced for the Ly-beta peaks and C II
wings, and less significant for the Ly-beta blue peak and O VI blue wing. We
also find that the Ly-beta profiles are more reversed in the coronal hole than
in the quiet Sun. We suggest that the jets produced by EEs emit Doppler-shifted
Ly-beta photons, causing enhanced emission at positions of the peaks of Ly-beta
profiles. The more-reversed Ly-beta profiles confirm the presence of a larger
opacity in the coronal hole than in the quiet Sun. The finding that EEs modify

approaches a limiting value which at a redshift of $z + 1 = 30$ is close to 400
mK in the limit of large string tension. The signal will have a specific
signature in position space: the excess 21cm radiation will be confined to a
wedge-shaped region whose tip corresponds to the position of the string, whose
planar dimensions are set by the planar dimensions of the string wake, and
whose thickness (in redshift direction) depends on the string tension. For
wakes created at $z_i + 1 = 10^3$, then at a redshift of $z + 1 = 30$ the
critical value of the string tension $\mu$ is $G \mu = 6 \times 10^{-7}$, and
it decreases linearly with redshift (for wakes created at the time of equal
matter and radiation, the critical value is a factor of two lower at the same
redshift). For smaller tensions, cosmic strings lead to an observable
absorption signal with the same wedge geometry.

  Physics",,,,"math.QA hep-th math.RT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce a cohomology theory of grading-restricted vertex algebras. To
construct the {\it correct} cohomologies, we consider linear maps from tensor
powers of a grading-restricted vertex algebra to ""rational functions valued in
the algebraic completion of a module for the algebra,"" instead of linear maps
from tensor powers of the algebra to a module for the algebra. One subtle
complication arising from such functions is that we have to carefully address
the issue of convergence when we compose these linear maps with vertex
operators. In particular, for each $n\in \mathbb{N}$, we have an inverse system
$\{H^{n}_{m}(V, W)\}_{m\in \mathbb{Z}_{+}}$ of $n$-th cohomologies and an
additional $n$-th cohomology $H_{\infty}^{n}(V, W)$ of a grading-restricted
vertex algebra $V$ with coefficients in a $V$-module $W$ such that
$H_{\infty}^{n}(V, W)$ is isomorphic to the inverse limit of the inverse system
$\{H^{n}_{m}(V, W)\}_{m\in \mathbb{Z}_{+}}$. In the case of $n=2$, there is an
additional second cohomology denoted by $H^{2}_{\frac{1}{2}}(V, W)$ which will
be shown in a sequel to the present paper to correspond to what we call
square-zero extensions of $V$ and to first order deformations of $V$ when
$W=V$.

Schwinger-Dyson (SD) equation with non-running coupling. We study the
techni-dilaton as a flavor-singlet bound state of techni-fermions by including
the techni-gluon condensate (tGC) effect into the previous (bottom-up)
holographic approach to the SWC-TC, a deformation of the holographic QCD with
$\gamma_m \simeq 0$ by large anomalous dimension $\gamma_m \simeq 1$. With
including a bulk scalar field corresponding to the gluon condensate, we first
improve the Operator Product Expansion of the current correlators so as to
reproduce gluonic $1/Q^4$ term both in QCD and SWC-TC. We find in QCD about
$10\%$ (negative) contribution of gluon condensate to the $\rho$ meson mass. We
also calculate the oblique electroweak $S$-parameter in the presence of the
effect of the tGC and find that for the fixed value of $S$ the tGC effects
dramatically reduce the flavor-singlet scalar (techni-dilaton) mass $M_{\rm
TD}$ (in the unit of $F_\pi$), while the vector and axial-vector masses
$M_\rho$ and $M_{a_1}$ are rather insensitive to the tGC, where $F_\pi$ is the
decay constant of the techni-pion. If we use the range of values of tGC implied
by the ladder SD analysis of the non-perturbative scale anomaly in the large
$N_f$ QCD near the conformal window, the phenomenological constraint $S \simeq
0.1$ predicts the techni-dilaton mass $M_{\rm TD} \sim 600$ GeV which is within

having both magnetic-dipole and electric-quadrupole couplings with external
time-dependent fields. We assume that the effective E and B fields remain
orthogonal during the quantum cycles. This mild restriction has many
advantages. It provides simple symmetries leading to selection rules and the
Hamiltonian-parameter and density-matrix spaces coincide for S=1. This implies
the identity of the Berry and Aharonov-Anandan phases, which is lost for S>1.
We have found that new features of Berry phases emerge for integer spins>2. We
provide explicit numerical results of Berry phases for S=2,3,4. We give a
precise analysis of the non-adiabatic corrections. The accuracy for satisfying
adiabaticity is greatly improved if one chooses for the time derivatives of the
parameters a time-dependence having a Blackman pulse shape. This has the effect
of taming the non-adiabatic oscillation corrections which could be generated by
a linear ramping. For realistic experimental conditions, the non-adibatic
corrections can be kept < 0.1%. For quantum cycles,involving as sole periodic
parameter the precession angle of E around B, the corrections odd upon the
reversal of the angular velocity can be cancelled exactly if the quadrupole to
dipole coupling ratio takes a ""magic"" value. The even ones are cancelled by
subtraction of the phases relative to opposite velocities. As a possible
application of the results of this paper we suggest a route to holonomic
entanglement of N non-correlated 1/2-spins by performing adiabatic cycles
governed by a Hamiltonian which is a non-linear function of the total spin

the diffuse Galactic 511keV emission is the beta-decay of unstable nuclei like
56Ni and 44Ti synthesised by massive stars and supernovae. Although a large
fraction of these positrons annihilate in the ejecta of SNe/SNRs, no
point-source of annihilation radiation appears in the INTEGRAL/SPI map of the
511keV emission. We exploit the absence of detectable annihilation emission
from young local SNe/SNRs to derive constraints on the transport of MeV
positrons inside SN/SNR ejecta and their escape into the CSM/ISM, both aspects
being crucial to the understanding of the observed Galactic 511keV emission. We
simulated 511keV lightcurves resulting from the annihilation of the decay
positrons of 56Ni and 44Ti in SNe/SNRs and their surroundings using a simple
model. We computed specific 511keV lightcurves for Cas A, Tycho, Kepler,
SN1006, G1.9+0.3 and SN1987A, and compared these to the upper-limits derived
from INTEGRAL/SPI observations. The predicted 511keV signals from positrons
annihilating in the ejecta are below the sensitivity of the SPI instrument by
several orders of magnitude, but the predicted 511keV signals for positrons
escaping the ejecta and annihilating in the surrounding medium allowed to
derive upper-limits on the positron escape fraction of ~13% for Cas A, ~12% for
Tycho, ~30% for Kepler and ~33% for SN1006. The transport of ~MeV positrons
inside SNe/SNRs cannot be constrained from current observations of the 511keV
emission from these objects, but the limits obtained on their escape fraction
are consistent with a nucleosynthesis origin of the positrons that give rise to
the diffuse Galactic 511keV emission.

developed on the basis of the Clapeyron equation. The phase transition in the
system with well-established properties is taken as a reference process to
search for the parameters of phase transition in the perturbed equilibrium
system. The main equation, derived in the framework of both classical
thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, establishes a correlation between
variations of enthalpies of evaporation, \Delta (\Delta H), which is induced by
perturbations, and the equilibrium vapor pressures. The dissolution of a
solute, changing the surface shape, and the effect of the external field of
adsorbents are considered as the perturbing actions on the liquid phase. The
model provides the unified method for studying (1) solutions, (2) membrane
separations (3) surface phenomena, and (4) effect of the adsorption field; it
leads to the useful relations between \Delta (\Delta H), on the one hand, and
the osmotic pressures, the Donnan potential, the surface curvature, and the
pore structure, on the other hand. The value of \Delta(\Delta H) has a clear
physical meaning and gives a new insight into our understanding of the
apparently different phenomena. The model is applicable if the change between
entropies of the comparable gas phases is far more than the difference between
entropies of the liquid phases.
