even Higgs mass from direct LEP searches and the theoretical upper bound of the
MSSM. We study the beyond MSSM (BMSSM) effects via an effective field-theory

relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) jet formation simulations directly to
very-long baseline interferometric multi-frequency polarization observations of
the pc-scale structure of active galactic nucleus (AGN) jets. Unlike the jet
emission, which requires post hoc modeling of the non-thermal electrons, the
Faraday rotation measures (RMs) depend primarily upon simulated quantities and
thus provide a robust way in which to confront simulations with observations.
We compute RM distributions of 3D global GRMHD jet formation simulations, with
which we explore the dependence upon model and observational parameters,
emphasizing the signatures of structures generic to the theory of MHD jets.
With typical parameters, we find that it is possible to reproduce the observed
magnitudes and many of the structures found in AGN jet RMs, including the
presence of transverse RM gradients. In our simulations the RMs are generated
within a smooth extension of the jet itself, containing ordered toroidally
dominated magnetic fields. This results in a particular bilateral morphology
that is unlikely to arise due to Faraday rotation in distant foreground clouds.
However, critical to efforts to probe the Faraday screen will be resolving the
transverse jet structure. Therefore, the RMs of radio cores may not be reliable
indicators of the properties of the rotating medium. Finally, we are able to
constrain the particle content of the jet, finding that at pc-scales AGN jets
are electromagnetically dominated, with roughly 2% of the comoving energy in
nonthermal leptons and much less in baryons.

The dust mass-loss rate from the stars increases with pulsation period and
bolometric luminosity. Higher mass-loss rates are associated with greater
contributions from silicate grains. The dust mass-loss rate also depends on
metallicity. The dependence is most clear when segregating the sample by dust

when segregating by period. The spectra are rich in solid-state and molecular
features. Emission from alumina dust is apparent across the range of
metallicities. Spectra with a 13-um dust emission feature, as well as an
associated feature at 20 um, also appear at most metallicities. Molecular
features in the spectra include H_2O bands at 6.4-6.8 um, seen in both emission

nuclei over a large range of excitation energies, it was necessary to consider
three ingredients in the statistical model. Firstly, transmission coefficients
or barrier penetration factors for charged-particle emission are typically
taken from global fits to elastic-scattering data. However, such transmission
coefficients do not reproduce the barrier region of evaporation spectra and
reproduction of the data requires a distributions of Coulomb barriers. This is
possibly associated with large fluctuations in the compound-nucleus shape or
density profile. Secondly for heavy nuclei, an excitation-energy dependent
level-density parameter is required to describe the slope of the exponential
tails of these spectra. The level-density parameter was reduced at larger
temperatures, consistent with the expected fadeout of long-range correlation,
but the strong $A$ dependence of this effect is unexpected. Lastly to describe
the angular-momentum dependence of the level density in light nuclei at large
spins, the macroscopic rotational energy of the nucleus has to be reduced from
the values predicted with the Finite-Range Liquid-Drop model.

sized bubble in the vicinity of the last scattering surface, a signal is
imprinted onto CMB via a combination of Sach-Wolfe and an early integrated
Sach-Wolfe (ISW) effects. Smaller, sub-horizon sized bubbles at lower redshifts
(during matter domination and later) can imprint secondary anisotropies on the
CMB via Rees-Sciama, late-time ISW and Ostriker-Vishniac effects. Our scenario,
and arguably most similar inflationary models, produce bubbles which are
over/underdense in potential: in density such bubbles are characterized by
having a distinct wall with the interior staying at the cosmic mean density. We
show that such models can potentially, with only moderate fine tuning, explain
the \emph{cold spot}, a non-Gaussian feature identified in the Wilkinson
Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) data by several authors. However, more
detailed comparisons with current and future CMB data are necessary to confirm

seem to show a weak correlation with the distribution of matter relatively near
to us in the universe. It has earlier been proposed that UHECRs could be
accelerated in either the nucleus or the outer lobes of the nearby radio galaxy
Cen A. We show that UHECR production at a spatially intermediate location about
15 kpc northeast from the nucleus, where the jet emerging from the nucleus is
observed to strike a large star-forming shell of gas, is a plausible
alternative. A relativistic jet is capable of accelerating lower-energy heavy
seed cosmic rays (CRs) to UHECRs on timescales comparable to the time it takes
the jet to pierce the large gaseous cloud. In this model many CRs arising from
a starburst, with a composition enhanced in heavy elements near the knee region
around PeV, are boosted to ultra-high energies by the relativistic shock of a
newly oriented jet. This model matches the overall spectrum shown by the Auger
data and also makes a prediction for the chemical composition as a function of
particle energy. We thus predict an observable anisotropy in the composition at
high energy in the sense that lighter nuclei should preferentially be seen
toward the general direction of Cen A. Taking into consideration the magnetic
field models for the Galactic disk and a Galactic magnetic wind, this scenario
may resolve the discrepancy between HiRes and Auger results concerning the
chemical composition of UHECRs.

theoretically that, in a pillar photonic crystal structure, light transmission
and homogeneity of the pillar distribution are correlated by a simple linear
law once the grade of homogeneity of the photonic structure is measured by the
Shannon index, widely employed in statistics, ecology and information entropy.
The statistical analysis shows that the transmission of light in such media
depends linearly from their homogeneity: the more is homogeneous the structure,
the more is the light transmitted. With the found linear relationship it is
possible to predict the transmission of light in random photonic structures.

detecting planets as small as the Earth. The detection of these planets however
requires the removal of all false positives. Although many false positives can
be identified by a detailed analysis of the LCs, the detections of others
require additional observations. An important source of false positives are
faint eclipsing binaries within the PSF of the target stars. We develop a new
method that allows us to detect faint eclipsing binaries with a separation
smaller than one arcsec from target stars. We thereby focus on binaries that
mimic the transits of terrestrial planets. These binaries can be either at the
same distance as the target star (triple stars), or at either larger, or
smaller distances. A close inspection of the problem indicates that in all
relevant cases the binaries are brighter in the infrared than in the optical
regime. We show how high resolution IR spectroscopy can be used to remove these
false positives. For the triple star case, we find that the brightness
difference between a primary and an eclipsing secondary is about 9-10 mag in
the visual but only about 4.5-5.9 magnitudes in the K-band. We demonstrate how
the triple star hypothesis can be excluded by taking a high-resolution IR
spectrum. Simulations of these systems show that the companions can be detected
with a false-alarm probability of 2%, if the spectrum has a S/N-ratio > 100. We
show that high-resolution IR spectra also allows to detect most of the false
positives caused by foreground or background binaries. If high resolution IR
spectroscopy is combined with photometric methods, virtually all false
positives can be detected without RV measurements. It is thus possible to
confirm transiting terrestrial planets with a modest investment of observing
time.

nodal direction, there are electron pockets near the antinodes which are
connected to the hole pockets by gapped bridging contours. We determine the
contours of nearest approach as would be measured in angular resolved
photoemission experiments and emphasize signatures of the Fermi surface
reconstruction from the large Fermi contour of Fermi liquid theory (which
contains $1+x$ hole states) to the Luttinger pocket (which contains $x$ hole
states). We find that the quasiparticle effective mass renormalization
increases strongly towards the edge of the Luttinger pockets beyond which it
diverges.

showing time lags between flux variations in the soft- (0.3-1 keV) and
medium-energy (1-4 keV) X-ray bands that oscillate between positive and
negative values as a function of the frequency of the mode of variation. Here
we measure and analyse the lags also between a harder X-ray band (4-7.5 keV)
and the soft and medium bands, using existing XMM-Newton data, and demonstrate
that the entire spectrum of lags, considering both the full energy range,
0.3-7.5 keV, and the full frequency range, 10^-5 < nu < 10^-2 Hz, are
inconsistent with previous claims of arising as reverberation associated with
the inner accretion disk. Instead we demonstrate that a simple reverberation
model, in which scattering or reflection is present in all X-ray bands,
explains the full set of lags without requiring any ad hoc explanation for the
time lag sign changes. The range of time delays required to explain the
observed lags extends up to about 1800 s in the hard band. The results are
consistent with reverberation caused by scattering of X-rays passing through an
absorbing medium whose opacity decreases with increasing energy and that
partially-covers the source. A high covering factor of absorbing and scattering
circumnuclear material is inferred.

noise have been used to model read channels in magnetic recording and other

maximum likelihood sequence detection in such channels. However, the problem of
finding an analytical upper bound on the bit error rate of the Viterbi detector
in this case has not been fully investigated. Current techniques rely on an
exhaustive enumeration of short error events and determine the BER using a
union bound. In this work, we consider a subset of the class of ISI channels
with data dependent Gauss-Markov noise. We derive an upper bound on the
pairwise error probability (PEP) between the transmitted bit sequence and the
decoded bit sequence that can be expressed as a product of functions depending
on current and previous states in the (incorrect) decoded sequence and the
(correct) transmitted sequence. In general, the PEP is asymmetric. The average
BER over all possible bit sequences is then determined using a pairwise state
diagram. Simulations results which corroborate the analysis of upper bound,
demonstrate that analytic bound on BER is tight in high SNR regime. In the high
SNR regime, our proposed upper bound obviates the need for computationally
expensive simulation.

gravitational theory, we show that very general formulas can be constructed for
the acceleration felt by a particle. Dimensional analysis shows that this
inclusion naturally leads to the appearance of a mass-length scale in gravity,
breaking its scale invariance. A particular form of the modified gravitational
force is constructed and tested for consistency with observations over a wide
range of astrophysical environments, from solar system to extragalactic scales.
We show that over any limited range of physical parameters, which define a
specific class of astrophysical objects, the dispersion velocity of a system
must be a power law of its mass and size. These powers appear linked together
through a natural constraint relation of the theory. This yields a generalised
gravitational equilibrium relation valid for all astrophysical systems. A
general scheme for treating spherical symmetrical density distributions is
presented, which in particular shows that the fundamental plane of elliptical
galaxies, the Newtonian virial equilibrium, the Tully-Fisher and the
Faber-Jackson relations, as well as the scalings observed in local dwarf
spheroidal galaxies, are nothing but particular cases of that relation when
applied to the appropriate mass-length scales. We discuss the implications of

implement abc-boost, a base class must be identified at each boosting step.
Prior studies used a very expensive procedure based on exhaustive search for
determining the base class at each boosting step. Good testing performances of
abc-boost (implemented as abc-mart and abc-logitboost) on a variety of datasets
were reported.
  For large datasets, however, the exhaustive search strategy adopted in prior
abc-boost algorithms can be too prohibitive. To overcome this serious
limitation, this paper suggests a heuristic by introducing Gaps when computing
the base class during training. That is, we update the choice of the base class
only for every $G$ boosting steps (i.e., G=1 in prior studies). We test this
idea on large datasets (Covertype and Poker) as well as datasets of moderate
sizes. Our preliminary results are very encouraging. On the large datasets,
even with G=100 (or larger), there is essentially no loss of test accuracy. On
the moderate datasets, no obvious loss of test accuracy is observed when G<=
20~50. Therefore, aided by this heuristic, it is promising that abc-boost will
be a practical tool for accurate multi-class classification.

This gives a new combinatorial identity for the number $\epsilon_g(n)$ of
unicellular maps of size $n$ and genus $g$. Contrarily to the Harer-Zagier
recurrence formula, this identity is recursive in only one parameter (the
genus). Iterating the construction gives an explicit bijection between
unicellular maps and plane trees with distinguished vertices, which gives a
combinatorial explanation (and proof) of the fact that $\epsilon_g(n)$ is the

given sigma, elliptical galaxies in groups have systematically weaker Balmer
absorption than their field counterparts, although this environmental
dependence is most pronounced at low sigma; (2) there is no clear environmental
dependence of <Fe>, while the alpha-element absorption indices such as Mgb are
only slightly stronger in galaxies belonging to rich groups. An analysis based
on simple stellar populations (SSPs) reveals that more massive elliptical
galaxies are older, more metal-rich and more strongly alpha-enhanced. We also
find that: (1) the SSP-equivalent ages of galaxies in rich groups are, on
average, ~1 Gyr older than in the field, although once again this effect is
strongest at low sigma; (2) galaxies in rich groups have slightly lower [Fe/H]
and are marginally more strongly alpha-enhanced; and (3) there is no
significant environmental dependence of total metallicity, [Z/H]. Our results
are generally consistent with stronger low-level recent star formation in field
ellipticals at low sigma, similar to recent results based on ultraviolet and
infrared observations. (Abridged)

of a single country or the document collection of a large corporation. Despite
this, like general open web search engines, they are expensive to maintain,
expensive to operate, and hard to design. Because of this, predicting the
response time of a vertical search engine is usually done empirically through
experimentation, requiring a costly setup. An alternative is to develop a model
of the search engine for predicting performance. However, this alternative is
of interest only if its predictions are accurate. In this paper we propose a
methodology for analyzing the performance of vertical search engines. Applying
the proposed methodology, we present a capacity planning model based on a
queueing network for search engines with a scale typically suitable for the
needs of large corporations. The model is simple and yet reasonably accurate
and, in contrast to previous work, considers the imbalance in query service
times among homogeneous index servers. We discuss how we tune up the model and
how we apply it to predict the impact on the query response time when
parameters such as CPU and disk capacities are changed. This allows a manager
of a vertical search engine to determine a priori whether a new configuration
of the system might keep the query response under specified performance
constraints.

approaches for high-dimensional data analysis, but have traditionally been
treated separately. Here we propose an integrated approach, called sparse

learning the gradients of the prediction function directly from samples. By
imposing a sparsity constraint on the gradients, variable selection is achieved
by selecting variables corresponding to non-zero partial derivatives, and
effective dimensions are extracted based on the eigenvectors of the derived
sparse empirical gradient covariance matrix. An error analysis is given for the
convergence of the estimated gradients to the true ones in both the Euclidean
and the manifold setting. We also develop an efficient forward-backward
splitting algorithm to solve the SGL problem, making the framework practically
scalable for medium or large datasets. The utility of SGL for variable

artificial data as well as real-world examples. The main advantages of our

effective dimension reduction with sparse loadings, and an efficient algorithm
for large p, small n problems.

the corresponding relations satisfied by the dual polynomials. These recurrence
relations show that the Rahman polynomials are bispectral. In our theory the

polynomial terms as small perturbations of an underlying Wolter I optic design,
we begin by using the results of Monte-Carlo ray traces to devise trial
analytic functions, for an individual Wolter I mirror shell, that can be used
to represent the spatial resolution on an arbitrary focal surface. We then
introduce a notation and tools for Monte-Carlo ray tracing of a polynomial
mirror shell prescription which permits the polynomial coefficients to remain
symbolic. In principle, given a set of parameters defining the underlying

digital relay link from one receiver to another. Achievable rate regions are
derived based on a combination of Han-Kobayashi common-private information
splitting technique and several different relay strategies including
compress-and-forward and a partial decode-and-forward strategy, in which the
interference is partially decoded then binned and forwarded through the digital
link for subtraction at the other end. For the Gaussian Z-interference channel
with a digital link from the interference-free receiver to the interfered
receiver, the capacity region is established in the strong interference regime;
an achievable rate region is established in the weak interference regime. In
the weak interference regime, the partial decode-and-forward strategy is shown
to be asymptotically sum-capacity achieving in the high signal-to-noise ratio
and high interference-to-noise ratio limit. In this case, each relay bit
asymptotically improves the sum capacity by one bit. For the Gaussian
Z-interference channel with a digital link from the interfered receiver to the
interference-free receiver, the capacity region is established in the strong
interference regime; achievable rate regions are established in the moderately
strong and weak interference regimes. In addition, the asymptotically sum
capacity is established in the limit of large relay link rate. In this case,
the sum capacity improvement due to the digital link is bounded by half a bit
when the interference link is weaker than certain threshold, but the sum
capacity improvement becomes unbounded as the interference link becomes
stronger.

by a group of coordinate transformations which contains the diffeomorphisms as
a proper subgroup. The larger group is defined by the assumption that all
observers will agree whether any given quantity is conserved. Alternatively,
and equivalently, it is defined by the assumption that all observers will agree
that the general relativistic wave equation describes the propagation of light.
Thus, the group replacement is analogous to the replacement of the Lorentz
group by the diffeomorphisms that led Einstein from special relativity to
general relativity, and is also consistent with the assumption of constant
light velocity that led him to special relativity. The enlarged covariance
group leads to a non-commutative geometry based not on a manifold, but on a
nonlocal space in which paths, rather than points, are the most primitive
invariant entities. This yields a theory which unifies the gravitational and
electroweak interactions. The theory contains no adjustable parameters, such as

dimension of $\mathscr C$ is a sufficient, but no longer necessary, condition.
Besides, learnability of $\mathscr C$ under non-atomic measures does not imply
the uniform Glivenko-Cantelli property with regard to non-atomic measures. Our
learnability criterion is stated in terms of a combinatorial parameter
$\VC({\mathscr C}\,{\mathrm{mod}}\,\omega_1)$ which we call the VC dimension of
$\mathscr C$ modulo countable sets. The new parameter is obtained by
``thickening up'' single points in the definition of VC dimension to
uncountable ``clusters''. Equivalently, $\VC(\mathscr C\modd\omega_1)\leq d$ if
and only if every countable subclass of $\mathscr C$ has VC dimension $\leq d$
outside a countable subset of $\Omega$. The new parameter can be also expressed
as the classical VC dimension of $\mathscr C$ calculated on a suitable subset
of a compactification of $\Omega$. We do not make any measurability assumptions

compared to traditional approaches is that the analysis of the whole system
gives more precise results. Only few model-based approaches have been applied
to answer quantitative questions in safety analysis, often limited to analysis
of specific failure propagation models, limited types of failure modes or

large amounts of computing resources. New achievements in the domain of

occurrence is shown as well as accurate interpretation of the results of the

etc.) as well as mathematical quantities (e.g. probability and measures for
reliability, security and trust), and play an important (sometimes essential)
role in characterising the behavior and determining the properties of systems.
Such quantities are central to the definition of both the model of systems
(architecture, language design, semantics) and the methodologies and tools for
the analysis and verification of the systems properties.

transition between normothermia and hypothermia during haemorrhagic shock has
rarely been systematically quantified from intensive time series data. We
estimated the critical transition point (CTP) and provided confidence intervals
for core body temperature response to acute severe haemorrhage in a conscious
rat model. Estimates were obtained by traditional piecewise linear regression
(broken stick model) and compared to those from the more novel bent cable
regression. Bent cable regression relaxes the assumption of an abrupt point
transition, and thus allows the capture of a potentially gradual transition
phase; the broken stick is a special case of the bent cable model. We
calculated two types of confidence intervals, assuming either independent or
autoregressive structure for the residuals. In spite of the severity of the
haemorrhage, median temperature change was minor (0.8 C; IQR 0.57-1.31 C) and
only four of 38 rats were clinically hypothermic (core temperature < 35 C).
However, a transition could be estimated for 23 rats. Bent cable fits were
superior when the transition appeared to be gradual rather than abrupt. In all
cases, assuming independence gave incorrect uncertainty estimates of CTP. For
15 animals, neither model could be fitted because of irregular temperature
profiles that did not conform to the assumption of a single transition.
Arbitrary imposition of broken stick fits on a gradual transition profile and
assuming independent rather than autocorrelated error may result in misleading
estimates of CTP. Identification of the onset of irreversible shock will
require further quantification of appropriate time-dependent physiological
variables and their behaviour during haemorrhage.

time, we show that a direct to indirect bandgap transition is possible in an
armchair graphene nanoribbon by the application of an external bias along the
width of the ribbon, opening up the possibility of new device applications.
With the help of Dirac equation, we qualitatively explain this bandgap
transition using the asymmetry in the spatial distribution of the perturbation
potential produced inside the nanoribbon by the external bias. This is followed
by the verification of the bandgap trends with a numerical technique using
Magnus expansion of matrix exponentials. Finally, we show that the carrier
effective masses possess tunable sharp characters in the vicinity of the
bandgap transition points.

this paper, we study the peak statistics in weak-lensing convergence maps
around clusters of galaxies and beyond. We emphasize how the noise peak
statistics is affected by the density distribution of nearby clusters, and also
how cluster-peak signals are changed by the existence of noise. These are the
important aspects to be understood thoroughly in weak-lensing analyses for
individual clusters as well as in cosmological applications of weak-lensing
cluster statistics. We adopt Gaussian smoothing with the smoothing scale
$\theta_G=0.5\hbox{ arcmin}$ in our analyses. It is found that the noise peak
distribution near a cluster of galaxies depends sensitively on the density
profile of the cluster. For a cored isothermal cluster with the core radius
$R_c$, the inner region with $R\le R_c$ appears noisy containing on average
$\sim 2.4$ peaks with $\nu\ge 5$ for $R_c= 1.7\hbox{ arcmin}$ and the true peak
height of the cluster $\nu=5.6$, where $\nu$ denotes the convergence signal to
noise ratio. For a NFW cluster of the same mass and the same central $\nu$, the
average number of peaks with $\nu\ge 5$ within $R\le R_c$ is $\sim 1.6$. Thus a
high peak corresponding to the main cluster can be identified more cleanly in
the NFW case. In the outer region with $R_c<R\le 5R_c$, the number of high
noise peaks is considerably enhanced in comparison with that of the pure noise
case without the nearby cluster. (abridged)

Although detailed analytical solutions describing the afterglow emission
received by an on-axis observer during both the early and late phases of the
outflow evolution exist, a calculation of the received flux during the
intermediate phase and for an off-axis observer requires either a more
simplified analytical model or direct numerical simulations of the outflow
dynamics. In this paper we present light curves for off-axis observers covering
the long-term evolution of the blast wave calculated from a high resolution
two-dimensional relativistic hydrodynamics simulation using a synchrotron
radiation model. We compare our results to earlier analytical work and
calculate the consequence of the observer angle with respect to the jet axis
both for the detection of orphan afterglows and for jet break fits to the
observational data. We find that observable jet breaks can be delayed for up to
several weeks for off-axis observers, potentially leading to overestimation of
the beaming corrected total energy. When using our off-axis light curves to
create synthetic Swift X-ray data, we find that jet breaks are likely to remain
hidden in the data. We also confirm earlier results in the literature finding
that only a very small number of local Type Ibc supernovae can harbor an orphan
afterglow.

maps, coupled with multi-band imaging on 4-meter-class optical telescopes, have
yielded a sample of 23 galaxy clusters with redshifts between 0.118 and 1.066.
Of these 23 clusters, 10 are newly discovered. The selection of this sample is
approximately mass limited and essentially independent of redshift. We provide
optical positions, images, redshifts and X-ray fluxes and luminosities for the
full sample, and X-ray temperatures of an important subset. The mass limit of
the full sample is around 8e14 Msun, with a number distribution that peaks
around a redshift of 0.4. For the 10 highest significance SZE-selected cluster
candidates, all of which are optically confirmed, the mass threshold is 1e15
Msun and the redshift range is 0.167 to 1.066. Archival observations from
Chandra, XMM-Newton, and ROSAT provide X-ray luminosities and temperatures that
are broadly consistent with this mass threshold. Our optical follow-up
procedure also allowed us to assess the purity of the ACT cluster sample.
Eighty (one hundred) percent of the 148 GHz candidates with signal-to-noise
ratios greater than 5.1 (5.7) are confirmed as massive clusters. The reported
sample represents one of the largest SZE-selected sample of massive clusters
over all redshifts within a cosmologically-significant survey volume, which
will enable cosmological studies as well as future studies on the evolution,
morphology, and stellar populations in the most massive clusters in the

  variables","13 pages",,,,"math.NT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we will give a scheme-theoretic discussion on the unramified
extensions of an arithmetic function field in several variables. The notion of
unramified discussed here is parallel to that in algebraic number theory and
for the case of classical varieties, coincides with that in Lang's theory of
unramified class fields of a function field in several variables. It is twofold
for us to introduce the notion of unramified. One is for the computation of the
\'{e}tale fundamental group of an arithmetic scheme; the other is for an
ideal-theoretic theory of unramified class fields over an arithmetic function
field in several variables. Fortunately, in the paper we will also have
operations on unramified extensions such as base changes, composites,
subfields, transitivity, etc. It will be proved that a purely transcendental
extension over the rational field has a trivial unramified extension. As an
application, it will be seen that the affine scheme of a ring over the ring of
integers in several variables has a trivial \'{e}tale fundamental group.

close to the electron spin resonance frequency induces a sharp change of the
single electron spin orientation. Hyperfine interaction provides a feedback,
thus fixing the precession frequency of the electron spin in the external and
the Overhauser field near the modulation frequency. The nuclear polarization is
bidirectional and the electron-nuclear spin system (ENSS) possesses a few
stable states. A similar frequency-locking effect exists for two-color and
mode-locked excitations, too. However, the pulsed excitation with mode locked
laser brings about the multitudes of stable states in ENSS in a quantum dot.
The resulting precession frequencies of the electron spin differ in these
states by the multiple of the modulation frequency. Under such conditions ENSS
represents a digital frequency converter with more than a hundred stable
channels.

to the non-commutative scalar field theory proposed by Grosse and Wulkenhaar.
We derive the flow equation in the matrix representation and discuss the theory
space for the self-dual model. The features introduced by the external
dimensionful scale provided by the non-commutativity parameter, originally
pointed out in \cite{Gurau:2009ni}, are discussed in the FRGE context. Using a
technical assumption, but without resorting to any truncation, it is then shown
that the theory is asymptotically safe for suitably small values of the
$\phi^4$ coupling, recovering the result of \cite{disertori:2007}. Finally, we
show how the FRGE can be easily used to compute the one loop beta-functions of
the duality covariant model.

analytical capacitor model. Oxygen vacancies are preferentially formed at
p-type SrO|AlO2 rather than at n-type LaO|TiO2 interfaces; the excess electrons
introduced by the oxygen vacancies reduce their energy by moving to the n-type
interface. This asymmetric behavior makes an important contribution to the
conducting (insulating) nature of n-type (p-type) interfaces while providing a
natural explanation for the failure to detect evidence for the polar
catastrophe in the form of core level shifts.

engineering atom-light interactions. In this letter we study spin-1/2 and

the condensate wave function will develop non-trivial structures. From
numerical simulation we have identified two different phases. In one phase the
ground state is a single plane wave, and often we find the system splits into
domains and an array of vortices plays the role as domain wall. In this phase,
time-reversal symmetry is broken. In the other phase the condensate wave
function is a standing wave and it forms spin stripe. The transition between
them is driven by interactions between bosons. We also provide an analytical
understanding of these results and determines the transition point between the
two phases.
