of strongly correlated charge carriers is theoretically reproduced by using the
AdS/CFT correspondence. Our system is microscopically defined, and the analysis
does not rely on any phenomenological models of NDR mechanism. The interaction
between the heat reservoir and the nonequilibrium charge carriers is also taken
into account. The system realizes insulation due to the formation of the
neutral bound states of the charge carriers at low temperatures. However, the
insulation is broken and the field-induced conductor phase appears by applying
the external electric field greater than the critical value. We find that the
NDR appears right above the critical electric field in this phase, and the pair
creation of the charge carriers is crucial to realize the NDR. The present
result suggests a possibility to observe a similar NDR in excitonic insulators
or in the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma, where the insulation
originates in the formation of the neutral bound states.

Venaticorum stars, is usually assumed to be due entirely to gravitational
radiation. Motivated by the outflows observed in ultracompact binaries, we
investigate whether magnetically coupled winds could in fact lead to
substantial additional angular momentum losses. We remark that the scaling
relations often invoked for the relative importance of gravitational and
magnetic braking do not apply, and instead use simple non-empirical expressions
for the braking rates. In order to remove significant angular momentum, the
wind must be tied to field lines anchored in one of the binary's component
stars; uncertainties remain as to the driving mechanism for such a wind. In the
case of white dwarf accretors, we find that magnetic braking can potentially
remove angular momentum on comparable or even shorter timescales than
gravitational waves over a large range in orbital period. We present such a
solution for the 17-minute binary AM CVn itself which admits a cold white dwarf
donor and requires that the accretor have surface field strength ~6E4 G. Such a
field would not substantially disturb the accretion disk. Although the
treatment in this paper is necessarily simplified, and many conditions must be
met in order for a wind to operate as proposed, it is clear that magnetic
braking cannot easily be ruled out as an important angular momentum sink. We
finish by highlighting observational tests that in the next few years will
allow an assessment of the importance of magnetic braking.

the sigma Orionis cluster (tau~3 Ma, d~385 pc) and its relation to mass,
presence of circumstellar discs, and separation to the cluster centre by taking
advantage of the superb spatial resolution of the Chandra X-ray Observatory.
Methods: We used public HRC-I/Chandra data from a 97.6 ks pointing towards the
cluster centre and complemented them with X-ray data from IPC/Einstein,
HRI/ROSAT, EPIC/XMM-Newton, and ACIS-S/Chandra together with optical and
infrared photometry and spectroscopy from the literature and public catalogues.
On our HRC-I/Chandra data, we measured count rates, estimated X-ray fluxes, and
searched for short-term variability. We also looked for long-term variability
by comparing with previous X-ray observations. Results: Among the 107 detected
X-ray sources, there were 70 cluster stars with known signposts of youth, two
young brown dwarfs, 12 cluster member candidates, four field dwarfs, and two
galaxies with optical-infrared counterpart. The remaining sources had
extragalactic nature. Based on a robust Poisson-chi^2 analysis, nine cluster
stars displayed flares or rotational modulation during the HRC-I observations,
while other eight stars and one brown dwarf showed long-term X-ray flux
variations. We constructed a cluster X-ray luminosity function from O9.5 (~18
Msol) to M6.5 (~0.06 Msol). We found: a tendency of early-type stars in
multiple systems or with spectroscopic peculiarities to display X-ray emission,
that the two detected brown dwarfs and the least-massive star are among the
sigma Orionis objects with the highest L_X/L_J ratios, and that a large
fraction of known classical T Tauri stars in the cluster are absent in this and
other X-ray surveys. We concluded that dozens X-ray sigma Orionis stars and
brown dwarfs are still to be detected [abridged].

deduced a most-probable age older than 600 Ma. We discovered that the primary,
G 125-15, is in turn an inflated, double-lined, spectroscopic binary with a
short period of photometric variability of P ~ 1.6 d, which we associated to
orbital synchronisation. The observed X-ray and Halpha emissions, photometric
variability, and abnormal radius and effective temperature of G 125-15 AB
indicate strong magnetic activity, possibly due to fast rotation. Besides, the
estimated projected physical separation between G 125-15 AB and G 125-14 of

proper-motion companion of the same spectral type at a wide separation. They
are thus ideal targets for specific follow-ups to investigate wide and close

magnetic flux bundle from a depth of 7.5 Mm in the convection zone up into the
solar photosphere. The rise of the magnetic plasma in the convection zone is
accompanied by predominantly horizontal expansion. Such an expansion leads to a
scaling relation between the plasma density and the magnetic field strength
such that $B\propto\varrho^{1/2}$. The emergence of magnetic flux into the
photosphere appears as a complex magnetic pattern, which results from the
interaction of the rising magnetic field with the turbulent convective flows.
Small-scale magnetic elements at the surface first appear, followed by their
gradual coalescence into larger magnetic concentrations, which eventually
results in the formation of a pair of opposite polarity spots. Although the
mean flow pattern in the vicinity of the developing spots is directed radially
outward, correlations between the magnetic field and velocity field
fluctuations allow the spots to accumulate flux. Such correlations result from
the Lorentz-force driven, counter-streaming motion of opposite-polarity
fragments. The formation of the simulated Active Region is accompanied by
transient light bridges between umbrae and umbral dots. Together with recent
sunspot modeling, this work highlights the common magnetoconvective origin of
umbral dots, light bridges and penumbral filaments.

investigate the nucleosynthetic patterns at these metallicities. We have
estimated saturation corrections for the moderately under-resolved spectra, and
systems with very narrow Doppler parameter (b \le 5 km s-1) will likely have
underestimated abundances. For those systems with Doppler parameters b > 5 km
s-1, we have measured low metallicity DLA gas with [X/H] < -2.4 for at least

tetragonal structure that breaks inversion symmetry, with the highly polar

Application of a magnetic field between 2 and 12 T induces canted
antiferromagnetism of the Ni spins and the resulting magnetization closely
tracks the electric polarization. We speculate that the Ni magnetic forces
acting on the soft organic lattice can create significant distortions and
modify the angles of the thiourea molecules, thereby creating a magnetoelectric
effect. This is an example of how magnetoelectric effects can be constructed in
organo-metallic single crystals by combining magnetic ions with electrically

  Processor",,,,,"quant-ph cond-mat.dis-nn cond-mat.stat-mech cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Adiabatic quantum optimization offers a new method for solving hard
optimization problems. In this paper we calculate median adiabatic times (in
seconds) determined by the minimum gap during the adiabatic quantum
optimization for an NP-hard Ising spin glass instance class with up to 128
binary variables. Using parameters obtained from a realistic superconducting
adiabatic quantum processor, we extract the minimum gap and matrix elements
using high performance Quantum Monte Carlo simulations on a large-scale
Internet-based computing platform. We compare the median adiabatic times with
the median running times of two classical solvers and find that, for the
considered problem sizes, the adiabatic times for the simulated processor
architecture are about 4 and 6 orders of magnitude shorter than the two
classical solvers' times. This shows that if the adiabatic time scale were to
determine the computation time, adiabatic quantum optimization would be
significantly superior to those classical solvers for median spin glass
problems of at least up to 128 qubits. We also discuss important additional
constraints that affect the performance of a realistic system.

nonlocal relativity by supplementing the locality postulate with a certain

between the particles is described by an one-dimensional Riemann problem in a

dissipative processes is added automatically. As a result, our scheme has no

the exception of the number of the interacting neighbours which control the

relatively cool stars drawn from Doppler surveys, as opposed to hotter stars
that emerged later from transit surveys. The observed trend could be due to
differences in planet formation and migration around stars of varying mass.
Alternatively, we speculate that hot-Jupiter systems begin with a wide range of
obliquities, but the photospheres of cool stars realign with the orbits due to
tidal dissipation in their convective zones, while hot stars cannot realign
because of their thinner convective zones. This in turn would suggest that hot
Jupiters originate from few-body gravitational dynamics, and that disk
migration plays at most a supporting role.

gravitational lensing. The most plausible scenario is a supernova exploding
inside a massive, optically thick circumstellar medium, composed of multiple

then a significant fraction (~10%) of the most luminous supernova may be

a promising avenue for learning more about dark matter, but is hampered by the
frequent coincidence of high-energy astrophysical sources of such particles
with putative high-density regions of dark matter. We calculate the boost
factor and gamma-ray flux from dark matter associated with two shell-like
caustics of luminous tidal debris recently discovered around the Andromeda
galaxy, under the assumption that dark matter is its own supersymmetric
antiparticle. These shell features could be a good candidate for indirect
detection of dark matter via gamma rays because they are located far from the
primary confusion sources at the galaxy's center, and because the shapes of the
shells indicate that most of the mass has piled up near apocenter. Using a
numerical estimator specifically calibrated to estimate densities in N-body
representations with sharp features and a previously determined N-body model of
the shells, we find that the largest boost factors do occur in the shells but
are only a few percent. We also find that the gamma-ray flux is an order of
magnitude too low to be detected with Fermi for likely dark matter parameters,
and about 2 orders of magnitude less than the signal that would have come from
the dwarf galaxy that produces the shells in the N-body model. We further show
that the radial density profiles and relative radial spacing of the shells, in
either dark or luminous matter, is relatively insensitive to the details of the
potential of the host galaxy but depends in a predictable way on the velocity
dispersion of the progenitor galaxy.

$\rho_S$ that scales as $a^{-6}$, where $a$ is the scale factor, have been
proposed recently in a variety of contexts. We calculate numerically the effect
of such a stiff fluid on the primordial element abundances. Because the stiff
fluid energy density decreases with the scale factor more rapidly than
radiation, it produces a relatively larger change in the primordial helium-4
abundance than in the other element abundances, relative to the changes
produced by an additional radiation component. We show that the helium-4
abundance varies linearly with the density of the stiff fluid at a fixed
fiducial temperature. Taking $\rho_{S10}$ and $\rho_{R10}$ to be the stiff
fluid energy density and the standard density in relativistic particles,
respectively, at $T = 10$ MeV, we find that the change in the primordial helium
abundance is well-fit by $\Delta Y_p = 0.00024(\rho_{S10}/\rho_{R10})$. The
changes in the helium-4 abundance produced by additional radiation or by a
stiff fluid are identical when these two components have equal density at a

and the white dwarf cooling age in the metal-rich open cluster NGC 6791, we
compute a grid of white dwarf evolutionary sequences that incorporates for the
first time the energy released by the processes of 22Ne sedimentation and of
carbon/oxygen phase separation upon crystallization. The grid covers the mass
range from 0.52 to 1.0 Msun, and it is appropriate for the study of white
dwarfs in metal-rich clusters. The evolutionary calculations are based on a
detailed and self-consistent treatment of the energy released from these two
processes, as well as on the employment of realistic carbon/oxygen profiles, of
relevance for an accurate evaluation of the energy released by carbon/oxygen
phase separation. We find that 22Ne sedimentation strongly delays the cooling
rate of white dwarfs stemming from progenitors with high metallicities at
moderate luminosities, whilst carbon/oxygen phase separation adds considerable
delays at low luminosities. Cooling times are sensitive to possible
uncertainties in the actual value of the diffusion coefficient of 22Ne.
Changing the diffusion coefficient by a factor of 2, leads to maximum age
differences of approx. 8-20% depending on the stellar mass. We find that the
magnitude of the delays resulting from chemical changes in the core is
consistent with the slow down in the white dwarf cooling rate that is required
to solve the age discrepancy in NGC 6791.

and p-type metal-oxide-semiconductor (NMOS and PMOS) NWs in [100], [110] and

reduction increases velocities, either by lifting the heavy mass valleys, or
significantly changing the curvature of the bands. The carrier velocities of
PMOS [110] and [111] NWs are a strong function of diameter, with the narrower
D=3nm wires having twice the velocities of the D=12nm NWs. The velocity in the
rest of the NW categories shows only minor diameter dependence. This behavior
is explained through features in the electronic structure of the silicon host
material. The ballistic current, on the other hand, shows the least sensitivity
with cross section in the cases where the velocity has large variations. Since
the carrier velocity is a measure of the effective mass and reflects on the
channel mobility, these results can provide insight into the design of NW
devices with enhanced performance and performance tolerant to structure
geometry variations. In the case of ballistic transport in high performance
devices, the [110] NWs are the ones with both high NMOS and PMOS performance,
as well as low on-current variations with cross section geometry variations.

group''). Baker and Beynon proved that $G$ is finitely presented iff it is
finitely generated and projective. In the category $\mathcal U$ of {\it unital}
$\ell$-groups---those $\ell$-groups having a distinguished order-unit
$u$---only the $(\Leftarrow)$-direction holds in general. Morphisms in
$\mathcal U$ are {\it unital $\ell$-homomorphisms,} i.e., hom\-o\-mor\-phisms
that preserve the order-unit and the lattice structure. We show that a unital
$\ell$-group $(G,u)$ is finitely presented iff it has a basis, i.e., $G$ is
generated by an abstract Schauder basis over its maximal spectral space. Thus
every finitely generated projective unital $\ell$-group has a basis $\mathcal
B$. As a partial converse, a large class of projectives is constructed from
bases satisfying $\bigwedge\mathcal B\not=0$. Without using the
Effros-Handelman-Shen theorem, we finally show that the bases of any finitely
presented unital $\ell$-group $(G,u)$ provide a direct system of simplicial
groups with 1-1 positive unital homomorphisms, whose limit is $(G,u)$.

derives the detection rate of mid-infrared molecular emission as a function of
stellar mass. The sample covers a range of spectral type from early M to A, and
is supplemented by archival spectra of disks around A and B stars. It is drawn
from a variety of nearby star forming regions, including Ophiuchus, Lupus and
Chamaeleon. In total, we identify 22 T Tauri stars with strong mid-infrared H2O
emission. Integrated water line luminosities, where water vapor is detected,
range from 5x10^-4 to 9x10^-3 Lsun, likely making water the dominant line
coolant of inner disk surfaces in classical T Tauri stars. None of the 5
transitional disks in the sample show detectable gaseous molecular emission
with Spitzer upper limits at the 1% level in terms of line-to-continuum ratios
(apart from H2). We find a strong dependence on detection rate with spectral
type; no disks around our sample of 25 A and B stars were found to exhibit
water emission, down to 1-2% line-to-continuum ratios, in the mid-infrared,
while almost 2/3 of the disks around K stars show sufficiently intense water
emission to be detected by Spitzer. Some Herbig Ae/Be stars show tentative
H2O/OH emission features beyond 20 micron at the 1-2 level, however, and one of
them shows CO2 in emission. We argue that the observed differences between T
Tauri disks and Herbig Ae/Be disks is due to a difference in excitation and/or
chemistry depending on spectral type and suggest that photochemistry may be
playing an important role in the observable characteristics of mid-infrared
molecular line emission from protoplanetary disks.

curvature) and a flat XCDM model with equation of state parameter, w=p_x/\rho_x

we apply a joint analysis involving the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and
the CMB Shift Parameter signature. By neglecting systematic uncertainties, for
nonflat LCDM cosmologies we obtain $H_0=73.2^{+4.3}_{-3.7}$ km s$^{-1}$
Mpc$^{-1}$ (1sigma) whereas for a flat universe with constant equation of state
parameter we find $H_0=71.4^{+4.4}_{-3.4}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ (1$\sigma$).
Such results are also in good agreement with independent studies from the
Hubble Space Telescope key project and recent estimates based on Wilkinson
Microwave Anisotropy Probe, thereby suggesting that the combination of these
three independent phenomena provides an interesting method to constrain the
Hubble constant. In particular, comparing these results with a recent
determination for a flat LCDM model using only the SZE technique and BAO [Cunha

antiferromagnetic systems, and this leads to an effective $hh\phi$ three-point

two spatial dimensions by studying the non-perturbative behaviour of the Higgs
boson self-energy using the Dyson--Schwinger equations. The ground state turns
out to be unstable for all values of the three-point coupling. We interpret
this as being due to the formation of a (high-$T_C$) superconducting
condensate. The carrier doping dependence of the energy gap has a general
behaviour that is consistent with high-$T_C$ superconductivity.
Superconductivity co-exists with antiferromagnetic order for large

phonon conduction, large improvements on the thermoelectric figure of merit,
ZT, have been recently reported in nanostructures, compared to the raw
materials' ZT values. In addition, low dimensionality can improve a device's
power factor, offering an additional enhancement in ZT. In this work the
atomistic sp3d5s*-spin-orbit-coupled tight-binding model is used to calculate
the electronic structure of silicon nanowires (NWs). The Landauer formalism is
applied to calculate an upper limit for the electrical conductivity, the
Seebeck coefficient, and the power factor. We examine n-type and p-type
nanowires of diameters from 3nm to 12nm, in [100], [110], and [111] transport
orientations at different doping concentrations. Using experimental values for
the lattice thermal conductivity in nanowires, an upper limit for ZT is
computed. We find that at room temperature, scaling the diameter below 7nm can
at most double the power factor and enhance ZT. In some cases, however, scaling
does not enhance the performance at all. Orientations, geometries, and subband

rotational fluctuations in counterion distribution. The results exhibit
effective colloidal attractions under appropriate conditions. Meanwhile,
long-range repulsions persist over most of our studied cases. The repulsive
forces arise from the fact that in two dimensions the charged colloids cannot
be perfectly screened by counterions, as the residual quadrupole moments
contribute to the repulsions at longer range. And by applying multiple
expansions we find that the attractive forces observed at short range are
mainly contributed from electrostatic interactions among higher-order electric
moments. We argue that the scenario for attractive interactions discussed in
this work is applicable to systems of charged nanoparticles or colloidal

relatively large PAlon. The 3D plot of the LMC disk suggests an offcentered

balances between the SU's throughput and the interference it causes to PUs in
MIMO cognitive radio networks. In particular, we aim to maximize the throughput
of the SU, while keeping the interference temperature at the primary receivers
below a certain threshold.
  Unlike traditional MIMO systems, SUs may not have the luxury of knowing the
channel state information (CSI) on the links to PUs. This presents a key
challenge for a secondary transmitter to steer interference away from primary
receivers. In this paper, we consider three scenarios, namely when the
secondary transmitter has complete, partial, or no knowledge about the channels
to the primary receivers. In particular, when complete CSI is not available,
the interference-temperature constraints are to be satisfied with high
probability, thus resulting in chance constraints that are typically hard to
deal with. Our contribution is fourfold. First, by analyzing the distributional
characteristics of MIMO channels, we propose a unified homogeneous QCQP
formulation that can be applied to all three scenarios. The homogeneous QCQP
formulation, though non-convex, is amenable to semidefinite programming (SDP)
relaxation methods. Secondly, we show that the SDP relaxation admits no gap
when the number of primary links is no larger than two. Thirdly, we propose a
randomized polynomial-time algorithm for constructing a near-optimal solution
to the QCQP problem when there are more than two primary links. Finally, we
show that when the secondary transmitter has no CSI on the links to primary
receivers, the optimal solution to the QCQP problem can be found by a simple
matrix eigenvalue-eigenvector computation, which can be done much more
efficiently than solving the QCQP directly.

  Capability under Bounded Delay-Moment Requirements",,,,,"cs.NI cs.PF","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the rapid proliferation of broadband wireless services, it is of
paramount importance to understand how fast data can be sent through a wireless
local area network (WLAN). Thanks to a large body of research following the
seminal work of Bianchi, WLAN throughput under saturated traffic condition has
been well understood. By contrast, prior investigations on throughput
performance under unsaturated traffic condition was largely based on
phenomenological observations, which lead to a common misconception that WLAN
can support a traffic load as high as saturation throughput, if not higher,
under non-saturation condition. In this paper, we show through rigorous
analysis that this misconception may result in unacceptable quality of service:
mean packet delay and delay jitter may approach infinity even when the traffic
load is far below the saturation throughput. Hence, saturation throughput is
not a sound measure of WLAN capacity under non-saturation condition. To bridge
the gap, we define safe-bounded-mean-delay (SBMD) throughput and
safe-bounded-delay-jitter (SBDJ) throughput that reflect the actual network
capacity users can enjoy when they require finite mean delay and delay jitter,
respectively.
  Our earlier work proved that in a WLAN with multi-packet reception (MPR)
capability, saturation throughput scales super-linearly with the MPR capability
of the network. This paper extends the investigation to the non-saturation case
and shows that super-linear scaling also holds for SBMD and SBDJ throughputs.
Our results here complete the demonstration of MPR as a powerful
capacity-enhancement technique for WLAN under both saturation and
non-saturation conditions.

on a dedicated bolometer array in order to study long-term and short-term
radiation effects. The main objective was to study particles impacts on the
detectors applicable to future observations in orbit and possible hard and/or
soft curing to restore its performances. Cobalt-60 gamma ray irradiations did
not show significant degradation, so we mainly focused on single events effects
(SEE). Protons and alphas irradiations were then performed at the Van de Graaf
tandem accelerator at the Institut de Physique Nucleaire (IPN, Orsay, France),
respectively at 20MeV and 30MeV. Observation showed that the shape of signal
perturbations clearly depends on the location of the impacts either on the
detector itself or the read-out circuit. Software curing has then to be
anticipated in order to deglitch the signal. This test gives also a unique
opportunity to measure some parameters of the detector: electrical crosstalk
and thermo- electrical time constant. However a detailed bolometer model is
necessary to understand the contribution of the thermal response in relation

new component is $m_e=14.6\pm1.7\,M_{\oplus}$. Our best-fitting model places
the new planet in a 3-body resonance with the previously known giant planets
(which have mean periods of $P_c=30.4$ and $P_b=61.1$ days). The critical
argument, $\varphi_{\rm Laplace}=\lambda_c-3\lambda_b+2\lambda_e$, for the
Laplace resonance librates with an amplitude of $\Delta\varphi_{\rm
Laplace}=40\pm13^{\circ}$ about $\varphi_{\rm Laplace}=0^{\circ}$. Numerical
integration indicates that the four-planet system is stable for at least a
billion years (at least for the coplanar cases). This resonant configuration of
three giant planets orbiting an M-dwarf primary differs from the well-known
Laplace configuration of the three inner Galilean satellites of Jupiter, which
are executing very small librations about $\varphi_{\rm Laplace}=180^{\circ}$,
and which never experience triple conjunctions. The GJ~876 system, by contrast,
comes close to a triple conjunction between the outer three planets once per
every orbit of the outer planet, ``e.''

capacity-enhancement technique for random-access wireless local area networks

often under-utilized in MPR WLANs. In this paper, we propose a novel
multi-round contention random-access protocol to address this problem. This
work complements the existing random-access methods that are based on
single-round contention. In the proposed scheme, stations are given multiple
chances to contend for the channel until there are a sufficient number of
``winning"" stations that can share the MPR channel for data packet
transmission. The key issue here is the identification of the optimal time to
stop the contention process and start data transmission. The solution
corresponds to finding a desired tradeoff between channel utilization and
contention overhead. In this paper, we conduct a rigorous analysis to
characterize the optimal strategy using the theory of optimal stopping. An
interesting result is that the optimal stopping strategy is a simple
threshold-based rule, which stops the contention process as soon as the total
number of winning stations exceeds a certain threshold. Compared with the
conventional single-round contention protocol, the multi-round contention
scheme significantly enhances channel utilization when the MPR capability of
the channel is small to medium. Meanwhile, the scheme automatically falls back
to single-round contention when the MPR capability is very large, in which case
the throughput penalty due to random access is already small even with
single-round contention.

expansion starting at NNLO. The effects of high--energy resummation are found

from C and O through to the Intermediate Mass Elements (IME) Mg, Si, S, Ca, and
to Fe and Ni. In particular, Si and S are best seen in the IR. The availability
of IR data makes it possible to explore in greater detail the results of the

available. Modelling the spectra with a NLTE code reveals that the inner ejecta
contain $\sim 1 \Msun$ of material within a velocity of $\approx 4500$\,\kms.
%The spectrum is powered by \Nifs, in an amount ($0.076 \Msun$) consistent with
that %derived from the early-time data. The same mass of \Nifs\ derived from
the light curve peak ($0.076 \Msun$) was used to power the spectrum, yielding
consistent results. Oxygen is the dominant element, contributing $\sim 0.8

confirms that SN\,2007gr was the explosion of a low-mass CO core, probably the
result of a star of main-sequence mass $\approx 15 \Msun$. The ratios of the

the recycling model, providing the direct link between the progenitors and
their evolutionary products. The data analysis methodology has been chosen on
the basis of the precise knowledge of orbital and spin parameters from X-ray
observations. It is subdivided in three steps: we corrected the time series for
the effects of (I) the dispersion due to interstellar medium and (II) of the
orbital motions, and finally (III) folded modulo the spin period to increase
the signal-to-noise ratio. No radio signal with spin and orbital
characteristics matching those of the X-ray sources has been found in our
search, down to very low flux density upper limits. We analysed several
mechanisms that could have prevented the detection of the signal, concluding
that the low luminosity of the sources and the geometric factor are the most
likely reasons for this negative result.

spherical virus capsids is described. This little-understood phenomenon is a
fascinating example of the complex processes that occur in the simplest of
organisms. The fact that different viruses adopt similar structural forms is an
indication of a common underlying design, motivating the use of simplified,
low-resolution models in exploring the assembly process. Several versions of a
molecular dynamics approach are described. Polyhedral shells of different sizes
are involved, the assembly pathways are either irreversible or reversible, and
an explicit solvent is optionally included. Model design, simulation
methodology and analysis techniques are discussed. The analysis focuses on the
growth pathways and the nature of the intermediate states, properties that are
hard to access experimentally. Among the key observations are that efficient
growth proceeds by means of a cascade of highly reversible stages, and that
while there are a large variety of possible partial assemblies, only a
relatively small number of strongly bonded configurations are actually
encountered.

period is 0.126 days, the second longest period yet found for an eclipsing
sdB+dM, but still close to the minimum 0.1-d period among such systems. The
phase-folded light curve was used to detrend the orbital effects from the

pulsation peaks spanning frequencies from ~50 to 4500 uHz. The presence of a
complex pulsation spectrum in both the p-mode and the g-mode regions has never

with only seven systems known and only one with a pulsating primary. Pulsating

derived from seismological model fits to be cross checked with orbital mass

X-ray irradiation. Our aim is to investigate whether star formation is
significantly affected when the ISM of a proto-galaxxy enjoys different
metallicities and when a star forming cloud resides in the vicinity of a strong
X-ray source. We perform cosmological Enzo simulations with a detailed
treatment of non-zero metallicity chemistry and thermal balance. We also
perform FLASH simulations with embedded Lagrangian sink particles of a
collapsing molecular cloud near a massive, 10^{7} M\odot, black hole that
produces X-ray radiation. We find that a multi-phase ISM forms for metallicites
as small as 10^{-4} Solar at z = 6, with higher (10^{-2}Z\odot) metallicities
supporting a cold (< 100 K) and dense (> 10^{3} cm^{-3}) phase at higher (z =
20) redshift. A star formation recipe based on the presence of a cold dense
phase leads to a self-regulating mode in the presence of supernova and
radiation feedback. We also find that when there is strong X-ray feedback a
collapsing cloud fragments into larger clumps whereby fewer but more massive
protostellar cores are formed. This is a consequence of the higher Jeans mass
in the warm (50 K, due to ionization heating) molecular gas. Accretion
processes dominate the mass function and a near-flat, non-Salpeter IMF results.

NH3 + O -> NH + H2O is 0.56 eV, while that for N + N -> N2, and N + O -> NO to
be 0.27, and 0.14 eV, respectively. Our KMC calculations enable us to examine
the kinetics not only of these mainline processes but also of additional 15
reactions among several intermediate species that illuminate the reactivity and
selectivity of the former. In agreement with previous studies, we find that the
key role in high reactivity of RuO2(110) in ammonia decomposition is played by
the way in which, by promoting easier H abstraction, H bonding between ammonia
and its intermediates with the adsorbate and substrate O converts NH
decomposition into a non-activated (spontaneous) process. Further, our findings
confirm in detail what experiment and previous studies have suggested about NO
and N2 formation rates, namely, that NO desorption is a rate-limiting process
in that surface NO blocks reaction sites at lower temperatures. Our
calculations concerning selectivity (93% in favor of NO over N2) are in very
close agreement with experiment (95%). They also explain why NO formation is so
favored over N2 formation even at low O2 pressure. The significantly reduced N
diffusion caused by various intermediates present on the RuO2(110) surface
severely inhibits the recombination site for N+N -> N2, but interferes with
that for N + O -> NO far less owing to the nearby availability of O from
dissociation of O2.

This makes it difficult to study low-temperature physics of these frustrated

algorithm. A typical example is the so-called spin ice model, frustrated
ferromagnets on the pyrochlore lattice. The difficulty can be avoided by a
global-flip algorithm, the loop algorithm, that enables to sample over the
entire discrete manifold and to investigate low-temperature properties. We
extend the loop algorithm to Heisenberg spin systems with strong easy-axis
anisotropy in which the ground-state manifold is continuous but still retains
the spin-ice type degeneracy. We examine different ways of loop flips and
compare their efficiency. The extended loop algorithm is applied to the
following two models, a Heisenberg antiferromagnet with easy-axis anisotropy
along the z axis, and a Heisenberg spin ice model with the local <111>

hygroscopic water content and the higher s; so closer agreement is found with
concrete containing almost no bonded water molecules provided these are
characterized by a high {\sigma}. A novelty of the present paper is the
application of a mathematical- physical model to the propagation of errors in
the measurements, based on a sensitivity functions tool. The inaccuracy of
salinity (water content) is the ratio (product) between the conductivity
(permittivity) inaccuracy, specified by the probe, and the sensitivity function
of salinity (water content) relative to conductivity (permittivity), derived
from the constitutive equations of the medium. The main result is the model's
prediction that the lower the inaccuracy for the measurements of s and
{\theta}W (decreasing by as much as an order of magnitude from 10% to 1%), the
higher {\sigma}; so the inaccuracy for soil is lower.

Our approach involves a history dependent bias potential which is evaluated on
a grid. The corresponding free energy landscape is constructed via a histogram
reweighting procedure a posteriori. Due to the presence of the bias potential,
it can be also used to accelerate rare events. In addition, the calculated free
energy landscape is not restricted to the actual choice of collective variables
and can in principle be extended to auxiliary variables of interest without
further numerical effort. The applicability is shown for several examples. We
present numerical results for the alanine dipeptide and the Met-Enkephalin in
explicit solution to illustrate our approach. Furthermore we derive an
empirical formula that allows the prediction of the computational cost for the
ordinary metadynamics variant in comparison to our approach which is validated
by a dimensionless representation.

applied to observations of the circumstellar dust orbiting beta Pictoris. The
model accounts for the rates at which dust is produced by collisions among
unseen planetesimals, and the rate at which dust grains are destroyed due to
collisions. The model also accounts for the effects of radiation pressure,
which is the dominant perturbation on the disk's smaller but abundant dust
grains. Solving the resulting system of rate equations then provides the dust
abundances versus grain size and over time. Those solutions also provide the
dust grains' collisional lifetime versus grain size, and the debris disk's
optical depth and surface brightness versus distance from the star. Comparison
to observations then yields estimates of the unseen planetesimal disk's radius,
and the rate at which the disk sheds mass due to planetesimal grinding.
  The model is then applied to optical observations of the edge-on dust disk
orbiting beta Pictoris, and good agreement is achieved when the unseen
planetesimal disk is broad, with 75<r<150 AU. If it is assumed that the dust
grains are bright like Saturn's icy rings, then the cross section of dust in
the disk is A_d~2x10^20 km^2 and its mass is M_d~11 lunar masses. In this case
the planetesimal disk's dust production rate is quite heavy, dM_d/dt~9
earth-masses per Myr, implying that there is or was a substantial amount of
planetesimal mass there, at least 110 earth-masses. But if the dust grains are
darker than assumed, then the planetesimal disk's mass-loss rate and its total
mass are heavier. In fact, the apparent dearth of any major planets in this
region, plus the planetesimal disk's heavy mass-loss rate, suggests that the
75<r<150 AU zone at beta Pic might be a region of planetesimal destruction,
rather than a site of ongoing planet formation.

radio, and/or optical archives, and performing optical spectroscopy on them. As
a result, we identified or more accurately characterized 44 counterparts of
INTEGRAL sources: 32 active galactic nuclei, with redshift 0.019 < z < 0.6058,
6 cataclysmic variables (CVs), 5 high-mass X-ray binaries (2 of which in the
Small Magellanic Cloud), and 1 low-mass X-ray binary. This was achieved by
using 7 telescopes of various sizes and archival data from two online
spectroscopic surveys. The main physical parameters of these hard X-ray sources
were also determined using the available multiwavelength information. AGNs are
the most abundant population among hard X-ray objects, and our results confirm
this tendency when optical spectroscopy is used as an identification tool. The
deeper sensitivity of recent INTEGRAL surveys enables one to begin detecting
hard X-ray emission above 20 keV from sources such as LINER-type AGNs and
non-magnetic CVs.

z ~ 0.8 by more than an order of magnitude. We investigate the evolution in the
MZ and LZ relations in comparison with local MZ and LZ relations determined in
a consistent manner using ~21,000 galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We
show that high stellar mass galaxies (log(M/M_solar)~10.6) at z ~ 0.8 have
attained the chemical enrichment seen in the local universe, while lower
stellar mass galaxies (log(M/M_solar)~9.2) at z ~ 0.8 have lower metallicities
(Delta log(O/H)~0.15 dex) than galaxies at the same stellar mass in the local
universe. We find that the LZ relation evolves in both metallicity and B-band
luminosity between z ~ 0.8 and z~ 0, with the B-band luminosity evolving as a
function of stellar mass. We emphasize that the B-band luminosity should not be
used as a proxy for stellar mass in chemical evolution studies of star-forming
galaxies. Our study shows that both the metallicity evolution and the B-band
luminosity evolution for emission-line galaxies between the epochs are a
function of stellar mass, consistent with the cosmic downsizing scenario of
galaxy evolution.
