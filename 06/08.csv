also to treat free edge boundaries in the computational domain. Application to
both inviscid and viscous stationary low compressibility accretion disc models
in Close Binaries (CB) are shown. The investigation carried out in this paper
is a consequence of the fact that a low compressibility modelling is crucial to
check numerical reliability.
  Results show that physical viscosity supports a well-bound accretion disc
formation, despite the low gas compressibility, when a Gaussian-derived Kernel
(from the Error Function) is assumed, in extended particle range - whose Half
Width at Half Maximum (HWHM) is fixed to a constant $h$ value - without any
spatial restrictions on its radial interaction (hereinafter GASPHER). At the
same time, GASPHER ensures adequate particle interpolations at the boundary
free edges. Both SPH and adaptive SPH (hereinafter ASPH) methods lack accuracy
if there are not constraints on the boundary conditions, in particular at the
edge of the particle envelope: Free Edge (FE) conditions. In SPH, an
inefficient particle interpolation involves a few neighbour particles; instead,
in the second case, non-physical effects involve both the boundary layer
particles themselves and the radial transport.
  Either in a regime where FE conditions involve the computational domain, or
in a viscous fluid dynamics, or both, a GASPHER scheme can be rightly adopted
in such troublesome physical regimes. Despite the applied low compressibiity
condition, viscous GASPHER model shows clear spiral pattern profiles
demonstrating the better quality of results compared to SPH viscous ones.
Moreover a successful comparison of results concerning GASPHER 1D inviscid
shock tube with analytical solution is also reported.

relaxational (aging) effects. In the absence of relaxational effects the model
displays a monotonously increasing dependence of stress on strain-rate, and
stationary shear bands do not occur. However, in start up experiments transient
(although long lived) shear bands occur, that widen without bound in time. I
investigate this transient effect in detail, reproducing and explaining a t^1/2
law for the thickness increase of the shear band that has been obtained in
atomistic numerical simulations. Relaxation produces a negative sloped region
in the stress vs. strain-rate curve that stabilizes the formation of shear
bands of a well defined width, which is a function of strain-rate. Simulations
at very low strain-rates reveal a non-trivial stick-slip dynamics of very thin
shear bands that has relevance in the study of seismic phenomena. In addition,
other non-stationary processes, such as stop-and-go, or strain-rate inversion
situations display a phenomenology that matches very well the results of recent

calculated by taking into account the interplay between the nonleptonic and
semi-leptonic week processes. In agreement with previous studies, it is found
that the inclusion of the semi-leptonic processes may result in non-negligible
corrections to the bulk viscosity in a narrow window of temperatures. The
effect is generally more pronounced for pulsars with longer periods. Compared
to the normal phase, however, this effect due to the semi-leptonic processes is
less pronounced in spin-one color superconductors. Assuming that the critical
temperature of the phase transition is much larger than 40 keV, the main effect
of spin-one color superconductivity in a wide range of temperatures is an
overall increase of the bulk viscosity with respect to the normal phase. The
corresponding enhancement factor reaches up to about 9 in the polar and
A-phases, about 25 in the planar phase and about 29 in the CSL phase. This
factor is determined by the suppression of the nonleptonic rate in
color-superconducting matter and, therefore, may be even larger if all quark

metric-independent tessellation of the data space based on a recursive binary
splitting. Individual, data-driven bandwidths are assigned to each point,
scaled so that a constant ""mass"" M0 is enclosed. Kernel density estimation may
then be performed for different kernel shapes, and a combination of balloon and
sample point estimators is proposed as a compromise between resolution and
variance. A bias correction is evaluated for the particular (yet common) case
where the density is computed exactly at the locations of the data points
rather than at an uncorrelated set of locations. By default, the algorithm
combines a top-hat kernel with M0=2.0 with the balloon estimator and applies
the corresponding bias correction. These settings are shown to yield reasonable
results for a simple test case, a two-dimensional ring, that illustrates the
performance for oblique distributions, as well as for a six-dimensional

from a uniformly dense gas with zero angular momentum and extremely low
metallicity. Our 1D and 2D simulations explore how X-ray and UV radiation
emitted near the black hole regulates the gas supply from large scales. Both 1D
and 2D simulations show similar accretion rate and period between peaks in
accretion, meaning that the hydro-instabilities that develop in 2D simulations
do not affect the mean flow properties. We present a suite of simulations
exploring accretion across a large parameter space, including different
radiative efficiencies and radiation spectra, black hole masses, density and
temperature, $T_\infty$, of the neighboring gas. In agreement with previous
studies we find regular oscillatory behavior of the accretion rate, with duty
cycle $\sim 6%$, mean accretion rate 3% $(T_{\infty}/10^4 {\rm K})^{2.5}$ of
the Bondi rate and peak accretion $\sim 10$ times the mean for $T_{\infty}$
ranging between 3000K and 15000K. We derive parametric formulas for the period
between bursts, the mean accretion rate and the peak luminosity of the bursts
and thus provide a formulation of how feedback regulated accretion operates.
The temperature profile of the hot ionized gas is crucial in determining the
accretion rate, while the period of the bursts is proportional to the mean size
of the Str\""{o}mgren sphere and we find qualitatively different modes of
accretion in the high vs. low density regimes. We also find that softer
spectrum of radiation produces higher mean accretion rate.

of the so-called chemically active outflows. The bright bowshock B1 in the
southern outflow lobe is a privileged testbed of magneto-hydrodynamical (MHD)
shock models, for which dynamical and chemical processes are strongly
interdependent. We present the first results of the unbiased spectral survey of
the L1157-B1 bowshock, obtained in the framework of the key program ""Chemical
Herschel Surveys of Star Forming Regions"" (CHESS). The main aim is to trace the
warm and chemically enriched gas and to infer the excitation conditions in the
shock region. The CO 5-4 and H2O lines have been detected at high-spectral
resolution in the unbiased spectral survey of the HIFI-Band 1b spectral window
(555-636 GHz), presented by Codella et al. in this volume. Complementary
ground-based observations in the submm window help establish the origin of the
emission detected in the main-beam of HIFI, and the physical conditions in the
shock.}{Both lines exhibit broad wings, which extend to velocities much higher
than reported up to now. We find that the molecular emission arises from two
regions with distinct physical conditions: an extended, warm (100K), dense (3e5
cm-3) component at low-velocity, which dominates the water line flux in Band~1;
a secondary component in a small region of B1 (a few arcsec) associated with
high-velocity, hot (> 400 K) gas of moderate density ((1.0-3.0)e4 cm-3), which
appears to dominate the flux of the water line at 179mu observed with PACS. The
water abundance is enhanced by two orders of magnitude between the low- and the
high-velocity component, from 8e-7 up to 8e-5. The properties of the
high-velocity component agree well with the predictions of steady-state C-shock
models.

both oxidation states the THz response rapidly increases with hydration
saturating above ~25% (g H2O/g protein). Quasi-harmonic vibrational modes and

well fitted by a single powerlaw of photon index Gamma = 1.75 and from
consideration of the Fermi flux limit we constrain the high energy cutoff to be
350 keV < E < 25 MeV. Line emission from both near-neutral iron K_alpha at 6.39
keV and highly ionised iron, from Fe_(xxv) and Fe_(xxvi), is strongly detected
in the Suzaku spectrum, further confirming the results of previous observations
with Chandra and XMM-Newton. We find the centroid energies for the Fe_(xxv) and
Fe_(xxvi) emission to be 6.60 keV and 6.95 keV respectively, with the latter
appearing to be resolved in the Suzaku spectrum. We show that the Fe_(xxv) and
Fe_(xxvi) emission can result from a highly photo-ionised plasma of column
density N_(H) ~ 3 x 10^(23) cm^(-2). A Compton reflection component, e.g.,
originating from an optically-thick accretion disc or a Compton-thick torus,
appears either very weak or absent in this AGN, subtending < 1 sr to the X-ray
source, consistent with previous findings. Indeed the absence of either neutral
or ionised Compton reflection coupled with the lack of any relativistic Fe K
signatures in the spectrum suggests that an inner, optically-thick accretion
disc is absent in this source. Instead, the accretion disc could be truncated
with the inner regions perhaps replaced by a Compton-thin Radiatively
Inefficient Accretion Flow. Thus, the Fe_(xxv) and Fe_(xxvi) emission could
both originate in ionised material perhaps at the transition region between the
hot, inner flow and the cold, truncated accretion disc on the order of 10^(3) -
10^(4) gravitational radii from the black hole. The origin for the unresolved
neutral Fe K_alpha emission is then likely to be further out, perhaps
originating in the optical BLR or a Compton-thin pc-scale torus.

control over the corresponding uncertainties are of paramount importance for
Dark Matter (DM) searches. Using very recent high-resolution numerical
simulations of a Milky Way like object, we study the systematic uncertainties
that affect the determination of the local dark matter density based on
dynamical measurements in the Galaxy. In particular, extracting from the
simulation with baryons the orientation of the Galactic stellar disk with
respect to the DM distribution, we study the DM density for an observer located
at $\sim$8 kpc from the Galactic center {\it on the stellar disk}, $\rho_0$.
This quantity is found to be always larger than the average density in a
spherical shell of same radius $\bar{\rho}_0$, which is the quantity inferred
from dynamical measurements in the Galaxy, and to vary in the range
$\rho_0/\bar{\rho}_0=1.01-1.41$. This suggests that the actual dark matter
density in the solar neighbourhood is on average 21\% larger than the value
inferred from most dynamical measurements, and that the associated systematic
errors are larger than the statistical errors recently discussed in the
literature.

the fact that the number of permutations of $n$ objects scales factorially in
$n$. One recent way that has been used to reduce storage complexity has been to
exploit probabilistic independence, but as we argue, full independence
assumptions impose strong sparsity constraints on distributions and are
unsuitable for modeling rankings. We identify a novel class of independence
structures, called \emph{riffled independence}, encompassing a more expressive
family of distributions while retaining many of the properties necessary for
performing efficient inference and reducing sample complexity. In riffled
independence, one draws two permutations independently, then performs the
\emph{riffle shuffle}, common in card games, to combine the two permutations to
form a single permutation. Within the context of ranking, riffled independence
corresponds to ranking disjoint sets of objects independently, then
interleaving those rankings. In this paper, we provide a formal introduction to
riffled independence and present algorithms for using riffled independence
within Fourier-theoretic frameworks which have been explored by a number of
recent papers. Additionally, we propose an automated method for discovering
sets of items which are riffle independent from a training set of rankings. We
show that our clustering-like algorithms can be used to discover meaningful
latent coalitions from real preference ranking datasets and to learn the
structure of hierarchically decomposable models based on riffled independence.

with similar estimates for more luminous Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)
quasars to investigate the relationship between black hole mass and quasar
luminosity. We find a strong correlation between MgII FWHM and UV luminosity
and that most quasars at this early epoch are accreting close to the Eddington
limit. Thus these quasars appear to be in an early stage of their life cycle
where they are building up their black hole mass exponentially. Combining these
results with the quasar luminosity function, we derive the black hole mass
function at z=6. Our black hole mass function is ~10^4 times lower than at z=0
and substantially below estimates from previous studies. The main uncertainties
which could increase the black hole mass function are a larger population of
obscured quasars at high-redshift than is observed at low-redshift and/or a low
quasar duty cycle at z=6. In comparison, the global stellar mass function is
only ~10^2 times lower at z=6 than at z=0. The difference between the black
hole and stellar mass function evolution is due to either rapid early star
formation which is not limited by radiation pressure as is the case for black
hole growth or inefficient black hole seeding. Our work predicts that the black
hole mass - stellar mass relation for a volume-limited sample of galaxies
declines rapidly at very high redshift. This is in contrast to the observed
increase at 4<z<6 from the local relation if one just studies the most massive

where it is assumed that no collision will occur. Our approach is inspired by
the adversarial queuing theory, which is amended in order to model wireless
communication. More precisely, there is an adversary that specifies
transmission rates of wireless links and injects data in such a way that an
average number of data injected in a single round and routed through a single
wireless link is at most $r$, for a given $r\in (0,1)$. We also assume that the
additional ""burst"" of data injected during any time interval and scheduled via
a single link is bounded by a given parameter $b$.
  Under this scenario, we show that the nodes following so called {\em
work-conserving} scheduling policies, not necessarily the same, are guaranteed
stability (i.e., bounded queues) and reasonably small data latency (i.e.,
bounded time on data delivery), for injection rates $r<1/d$, where $d$ is the
maximum length of a routing path. Furthermore, we also show that such a bound
is asymptotically optimal on $d$.

Traditionally, encoding in this framework is performed by solving an
L1-regularized linear regression problem, commonly referred to as Lasso or
Basis Pursuit. In this work we combine the sparsity-inducing property of the
Lasso model at the individual feature level, with the block-sparsity property
of the Group Lasso model, where sparse groups of features are jointly encoded,
obtaining a sparsity pattern hierarchically structured. This results in the
Hierarchical Lasso (HiLasso), which shows important practical modeling
advantages. We then extend this approach to the collaborative case, where a set
of simultaneously coded signals share the same sparsity pattern at the higher
(group) level, but not necessarily at the lower (inside the group) level,
obtaining the collaborative HiLasso model (C-HiLasso). Such signals then share
the same active groups, or classes, but not necessarily the same active set.
This model is very well suited for applications such as source identification
and separation. An efficient optimization procedure, which guarantees
convergence to the global optimum, is developed for these new models. The
underlying presentation of the new framework and optimization approach is
complemented with experimental examples and theoretical results regarding
recovery guarantees for the proposed models.

observed transit timing cannot be explained by a constant period but by a
periodic variation in the observations minus calculations diagram. Simplified
models assuming the existence of a perturbing planet in the system and
reproducing the observed variations of timing residuals were identified by
three-body simulations. We found that the configuration with the hypothetical
second planet of the mass of about 15 Earth masses, located close to the outer
2:1 mean motion resonance is the most likely scenario reproducing observed
transit timing. We emphasize, however, that more observations are required to
constrain better the parameters of the hypothetical second planet in WASP-3

observations of the transit of the predicted second planet and the high
precision radial-velocity data are needed.

the structure and stellar population of two large stellar condensations (knots
A & B) along one of the faint optical ""jet-like"" tidal streams associated with
the spiral NGC 1097, with the goal of establishing their physical association
with the galaxy and their origin. METHODS: We use the VLT/FORS2 to get deep
V-band imaging and low-resolution optical spectra of two knots along NGC 1097's
northeast ""dog-leg"" tidal stream. With this data, we explore their morphology
and stellar populations. RESULTS: The FORS2 spectra show that the redshift of
knot A (and perhaps of knot B) is consistent with that of NGC 1097. The FORS2
photometry shows that the two knots match very well the photometric scaling
relations of canonical dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSph). From the spectral
analysis we find that knot A is mainly composed of stars near G-type, with no
signs of ongoing star formation. Comparing its spectrum to a library of
Galactic GC spectra, we find that the stellar population of this dSph-like
object is most similar to intermediate to metal rich GCs. We find moreover,
that the tidal stream shows an ""S"" shaped inflection as well as a pronounced
stellar overdensity at knot A's position. This suggests that knot A is being
tidally stripped, and populates the stellar stream with its stars. CONCLUSIONS:
We have discovered that two knots along NGC 1097's northeast tidal stream share
most of their spectral and photometric properties with ordinary dwarf
spheroidal galaxies (dSph). Moreover, we find strong indications that the
""dog-leg"" tidal stream arise from the tidal disruption of knot A. Since it has
been demonstrated that tidally stripping dSph galaxies need to loose most of
their dark matter before starting to loose stars, we suggest that knot A is at
present a CDM-poor object.

giants, with large consequence for the chemical yields of low-mass stars. We
investigate the role of thermohaline mixing during the evolution of stars
between 1Msun and 3Msun, in comparison to other mixing processes acting in
these stars. We use a stellar evolution code which includes rotational mixing,
internal magnetic fields and thermohaline mixing. We confirm that during the
red giant stage, thermohaline mixing has the potential to decrease the
abundance of ^3He which is produced earlier on the main sequence. In our models
we find that this process is working on the RGB only in stars with initial mass
M \simle 1.5Msun. Moreover we report that thermohaline mixing is present also
during core helium burning and beyond, and has the potential to change the
surface abundances of AGB stars. While we find rotational and magnetic mixing
to be negligible compared to the thermohaline mixing in the relevant layers,
the interaction of thermohaline motions with the differential rotation may be
essential to establish the time scale of thermohaline mixing in red giants. To
explain the surface abundances observed at the bump in the luminosity function,
the speed of the mixing process needs to be more than two orders of magnitude
higher than in our models. However it is not clear if thermohaline mixing is
the only physical process responsible for these surface abundance anomalies.
Therefore, at this stage, it is not possible to calibrate the efficiency of
thermohaline mixing against the observations.

attention because of its importance for predicting the power spectrum of cosmic
microwave background anisotropies. It has become clear that it is necessary to
account for a large number n >~ 100 of energy shells of the hydrogen atom,
separately following the angular momentum substates in order to obtain
sufficiently accurate recombination histories. However, the multi-level atom
codes that follow the populations of all these levels are computationally
expensive, limiting recent analyses to only a few points in parameter space. In
this paper, we present a new method for solving the multi-level atom
recombination problem, which splits the problem into a computationally
expensive atomic physics component that is independent of the cosmology, and an
ultrafast cosmological evolution component. The atomic physics component
follows the network of bound-bound and bound-free transitions among excited
states and computes the resulting effective transition rates for the small set
of ""interface"" states radiatively connected to the ground state. The
cosmological evolution component only follows the populations of the interface
states. By pre-tabulating the effective rates, we can reduce the recurring cost
of multi-level atom calculations by more than 5 orders of magnitude. The
resulting code is fast enough for inclusion in Markov Chain Monte Carlo
parameter estimation algorithms. It does not yet include the radiative transfer
or high-n two-photon processes considered in some recent papers. Further work
on analytic treatments for these effects will be required in order to produce a
recombination code usable for Planck data analysis.

problem, concrete models in the literature typically face two major obstacles.
First, the mechanism for generating a Higgs quartic coupling often leads to
large violations of custodial symmetry. Second, there is a tension between
precision electroweak observables in the gauge sector and fine-tuning in the
top sector. In this work, we present a new little Higgs model which solves both
of these problems. The model is based on an SO(6)xSO(6)/SO(6) coset space which
has custodial symmetry built in. The Higgs quartic coupling takes a
particularly simple form and does not suffer from the ""dangerous singlet""
pathology. We introduce a gauge breaking module which decouples the mass of
gauge partners from the mass of top partners, allowing for natural electroweak
symmetry breaking. The collider phenomenology is dominated by production and
decay of the top partners, which are considerably lighter than in traditional

information-preserving structures to classify all the kinds of information that

prove that every perfectly preserved code has the same structure as a matrix

classify distinct operational criteria for preservation (e.g., ""noiseless"",
""unitarily correctible"", etc.) and introduce two new and natural criteria for
measurement-stabilized and unconditionally preserved codes. Finally, for
several of these operational critera, we present efficient (polynomial in the

Type Ib Supernovae (SNe Ib), specifically a feature around 6200\AA\ which has
previously been attributed to high velocity H-alpha. In earlier work on SN
1999dn we found the most plausible alternative to H-alpha to be a blend of Si
II and Fe II lines which can be adjusted to fit by increasing the metallicity.
Our models are simple; they assume a powerlaw density profile with radius,
homologous expansion, and solar compositions. The helium core is produced by
burning 4H --> He in order to conserve nucleon number. For models with hydrogen
the outer skin of the model consists of a shell of solar composition. The
hydrogen mass of the standard solar composition shell is M_H less than about
0.001 times the mass of the sun in SN 1999dn and M_H less than about 0.2 times
the mass of the sun for SN 2000H. Our models fit the observed spectra
reasonably well, successfully reproducing most features including the
characteristic He I absorptions. The hydrogen feature in SN 1999dn is clear,
but much more pronounced in SN 2000H. We discuss a possible evolutionary
scenario that accounts for the dichotomy in the hydrogen shell mass between

optically-thick HI absorbers and use the higher-redshift system as a ""blocking

emission from the quasar. This allows us to directly image the rest-frame FUV
continuum emission of the lower-redshift DLA, without any quasar contamination
and with no bias towards large impact parameters. We introduce a formalism
based on galaxy number counts and Bayesian statistics with which we quantify
the probability that a candidate is the DLA host galaxy. This method will allow
the identification of a bona fide sample of DLAs that are too faint to be
spectroscopically confirmed. The same formalism can be adopted to the study of
other quasar absorption line systems (e.g. MgII absorbers). We have applied
this imaging technique to two QSO sightlines. For the z~2.69 DLA towards
J073149+285449, a galaxy with impact parameter b=1.54""=11.89 kpc and implied
star formation rate (SFR) of ~5 M/yr is identified as the most reliable
candidate. In the case of the z~2.92 DLA towards J211444-005533, no likely host
is found down to a 3-sigma SFR limit of 1.4 M/yr. Studying the HI column
density as a function of the impact parameter, including 6 DLAs with known
hosts from the literature, we find evidence that the observed HI distribution
is more extended than what is generally predicted from numerical simulation.

star clusters are ideal loci to study stellar dynamics due to the very high
densities reached, usually a million times higher than in the solar
neighborhood; they are unique laboratories to study processes related to
relaxation. There are a number of different techniques to model the global
evolution of such a system. In statistical models we assume that relaxation is
the result of a large number of two-body gravitational encounters with a net
local effect. We present two moment models that are based on the collisional
Boltzmann equation. By taking moments of the Boltzmann equation one obtains an
infinite set of differential moment equations where the equation for the moment
of order $n$ contains moments of order $n+1$. In our models we assume spherical
symmetry but we do not require dynamical equilibrium. We truncate the infinite
set of moment equations at order $n=4$ for the first model and at order $n=5$
for the second model. The collisional terms on the right-hand side of the
moment equations account for two-body relaxation and are computed by means of
the Rosenbluth potentials. We complete the set of moment equations with closure
relations which constrain the degree of anisotropy of our model by expressing
moments of order $n+1$ by moments of order $n$. The accuracy of this approach
relies on the number of moments included from the infinite series. Since both
models include fourth order moments we can study mechanisms in more detail that
increase or decrease the number of high velocity stars. The resulting model
allows us to derive a velocity distribution function, with unprecedented
accuracy, compared to previous moment models.

massive states are analytically obtained. Relevant conditions on the dilaton
coupling constant are found in order to identify with precision every finite
tensor and vector eigenstate in the theory. An exact quantization condition on
the whole mass spectrum, depending on the dilaton coupling constant and the
bulk Planck mass, is inherited from the extra-dimension. This allows finding an
exact rule to prevent tachyons in the theory and, by the same token, predicting
a possible Kalb-Ramond tensor zero-mode in 4D world. We also show that KK
massive-modes contributions onto 4D physics are strongly suppressed.

the absence of radiation is that between the energetic (collinear) parton and
the Glauber modes of the gluon fields in the medium. We derive the effective
Lagrangian for this interaction, and we show that the probability for picking
up transverse momentum k_\perp is given by the Fourier transform of the
expectation value of two transversely separated light-like path-ordered Wilson
lines. This yields a field theoretical definition of the jet quenching

generalized to include non-uniform magnetic permeability profiles, and used to
study the interaction between the magneto-dielectric heterostructures within
the leading order. The metamaterials are modeled as two dimensional arrays of
domains with varying permittivity and permeability. In the case of two
semi-infinite bodies with flat boundaries, the patterned structure of the
material properties is found to cause the normal Casimir-Lifshitz force to
develop an oscillatory behavior when the distance between the two bodies is
comparable to the wavelength of the patterned features in the metamaterials.
The non-uniformity also leads to the emergence of lateral Casimir-Lifshitz
forces, which tend to strengthen as the gap size becomes smaller. Our results
suggest that the recent studies on Casimir-Lifshitz forces between
metamaterials, which have been performed with the aim of examining the
possibility of observing the repulsive force, should be revisited to include
the effect of the patterned structure at the wavelength of several hundred

exhibit liquid-like breakup into droplets, we use molecular dynamics
simulations to investigate the evolution of a dense stream of macroscopic
spheres accelerating out of an opening at the bottom of a reservoir. We show
how nanoscale details associated with energy dissipation during collisions
modify the stream's macroscopic behavior. We find that inelastic collisions
collimate the stream, while the presence of short-range attractive interactions
drives structure formation. Parameterizing the collision dynamics by the
coefficient of restitution (i.e., the ratio of relative velocities before and
after impact) and the strength of the cohesive interaction, we map out a
spectrum of behaviors that ranges from gas-like jets in which all grains drift
apart to liquid-like streams that break into large droplets containing hundreds
of grains. We also find a new, intermediate regime in which small aggregates
form by capture from the gas phase, similar to what can be observed in
molecular beams. Our results show that nearly all aspects of stream behavior
are closely related to the velocity gradient associated with vertical free
fall. Led by this observation, we propose a simple energy balance model to
explain the droplet formation process. The qualitative as well as many
quantitative features of the simulations and the model compare well with
available experimental data and provide a first quantitative measure of the
role of attractions in freely cooling granular streams.

intermixed and abrupt configurations. We find that on both experimental and
theoretical fronts, the tendency toward intermixing is very strong. We have
also measured and calculated key electronic properties such as the presence of
electric fields and the value of the valence band discontinuity at the
interface. We find no measurable electric field in either the LaAlO3 or SrTiO3,
and that the valence band offset is near zero, partitioning the band
discontinuity almost entirely to the conduction band edge. Moreover, we find
that it is not possible to account for these electronic properties
theoretically without including extensive intermixing in our physical model of
the interface. The atomic configurations which give the greatest electrostatic
stability are those that eliminate the interface dipole by intermixing, calling
into question the conventional explanation for conductivity at this interface -
electronic reconstruction. Rather, evidence is presented for La indiffusion and
doping of the SrTiO3 below the interface as being the cause of the observed
conductivity.

shown that for the convexity of the Pareto rate region it is sufficient that
the interference-plus-noise covariance matrices (INCMs) of multiple users with
conflicting objectives approach identity matrix. The latter can be achieved by
using either orthogonal signaling, time-sharing, or interference cancellation
strategies. In the case of high interference, the interference cancellation is
preferable in order to increase the Pareto boundary and guarantee the convexity
of the Pareto rate region. The Nash bargaining (NB) is applied to transform the
MCO problem into a single-objective one. The characteristics of the NB over
MIMO interference systems such as the uniqueness, existence of the NB solution,
and feasibility of the NB set are investigated. When the NB solution exists,
the sufficient condition for the corresponding single-objective problem to have
a unique solution is that the INCMs of users approach identity matrix. A simple
multi-stage interference cancellation scheme, which leads to a larger convex
Pareto rate region and, correspondingly, a unique NB solution with larger user
rates compared to the orthogonal and time-sharing signaling schemes, is
proposed. The convexity of the rate region, effectiveness of the proposed
interference cancellation technique, and existence of the NB solution for MIMO

of the NB solution is also demonstrated. Finally, the special cases of

(symmetric groups $S_n$, matrix groups $GL_n$, $O_n$, $Sp_{2n}$) are
polynomials in $n$ (e.g., dimensions of irreducible representations). This
allowed Deligne to extend the representation theory of these groups to complex
values of the rank $n$. Namely, Deligne defined generically semisimple families
of tensor categories parametrized by $n\in \mathbb{C}$, which at positive
integer $n$ specialize to the classical representation categories. Using
Deligne's work, Etingof proposed a similar extrapolation for many
non-semisimple representation categories built on representation categories of
classical groups, e.g., degenerate affine Hecke algebras (dAHA). It is expected
that for generic $n\in \mathbb{C}$ such extrapolations behave as they do for
large integer $n$ (""stabilization""). The goal of our work is to provide a
technique to prove such statements. Namely, we develop an algebro-geometric
framework to study categories indexed by a parameter $n$, in which the set of
values of $n$ for which the category has a given property is constructible.
This implies that if a property holds for integer $n$, it then holds for
generic complex $n$. We use this to give a new proof that Deligne's categories
are generically semisimple. We also apply this method to Etingof's
extrapolations of dAHA, and prove that when $n$ is transcendental,
""finite-dimensional"" simple objects are quotients of certain standard induced
objects, extrapolating Zelevinsky's classification of simple dAHA-modules for
$n\in \mathbb{N}$. Finally, we obtain similar results for the extrapolations of
categories associated to wreath products of the symmetric group with
associative algebras.

error (MMSE) estimation. In particular, we consider the problem of estimating

process consists of two algorithms. First, a channel estimator blindly
estimates the channel gain using past observations. Second, a mismatched MMSE
estimator, optimized for the estimated channel gain, estimates the input
signal. We analyze the regret, i.e., the additional mean square error, that is
raised in this process. We derive upper-bounds on both absolute and relative
regrets. Bounds are expressed in terms of the Fisher information. We also study
regret for unbiased, efficient channel estimators, and derive a simple
trade-off between Fisher information and relative regret. This trade-off shows
that the product of a certain function of relative regret and Fisher
information equals the signal-to-noise ratio, independent of the input
distribution. The trade-off relation implies that higher Fisher information
results to smaller expected relative regret.

fields can act at a distance on charged particles even if they are identically

has been extensively studied, and the electric effect where an electron is
affected by a time-dependent electric potential that is constant in the region
where the electron is propagating, i.e., such that the electric field vanishes
along its trajectory. The Aharonov-Bohm effects imply such a strong departure
from the physical intuition coming from classical physics that it is no wonder
that they remain a highly controversial issue, after more than fifty years. The
existence of electric Aharonov-Bohm effect, that has not been confirmed
experimentally, is a very controversial issue. In their 1959 paper Aharonov and
Bohm proposed an Ansatz for the solution to the Schroedinger equation in
regions where there is a time-dependent electric potential that is constant in
space. It consists in multiplying the free evolution by a phase given by the
integral in time of the potential. The validity of this Ansatz predicts
interference fringes between parts of a coherent electron beam that are
subjected to different potentials. In this paper we prove that the exact
solution to the Schroedinger equation is given by the Aharonov-Bohm Ansatz up
to an error bound in norm that is uniform in time and that decays as a constant
divided by the velocity. Our results give, for the first time, a rigorous proof
that quantum mechanics predicts the existence of the electric Aharonov-Bohm
effect, under conditions that we provide. We hope that our results will
estimulate the experimental research on the electric Aharonov-Bohm effect.

event MOA-2009-BLG-016. The light curve is characterized by a short-duration
anomaly near the peak and an overall asymmetry. We find that the peak anomaly
is due to a binary companion to the primary lens and the asymmetry of the light
curve is explained by the parallax effect caused by the acceleration of the
observer over the course of the event due to the orbital motion of the Earth
around the Sun. In addition, we detect evidence for the effect of the finite
size of the source near the peak of the event, which allows us to measure the
angular Einstein radius of the lens system. The Einstein radius combined with
the microlens parallax allows us to determine the total mass of the lens and
the distance to the lens. We identify three distinct classes of degenerate
solutions for the binary lens parameters, where two are manifestations of the
previously identified degeneracies of close/wide binaries and positive/negative
impact parameters, while the third class is caused by the symmetric cycloid
shape of the caustic. We find that, for the best-fit solution, the estimated
mass of the lower-mass component of the binary is (0.04 +- 0.01) M_sun,
implying a brown-dwarf companion. However, there exists a solution that is
worse only by \Delta\chi^2 ~ 3 for which the mass of the secondary is above the
hydrogen-burning limit. Unfortunately, resolving these two degenerate solutions
will be difficult as the relative lens-source proper motions for both are
similar and small (~ 1 mas/yr) and thus the lens will remain blended with the
source for the next several decades.

offering a computational speed-up over classical algorithms for some problems,
the issue is poorly understood. We explore this computational speed-up by
investigating the ability to de-quantise quantum algorithms into classical
simulations of the algorithms which are as efficient in both time and space as
the original quantum algorithms.
  The process of de-quantisation helps formulate conditions to determine if a
quantum algorithm provides a real speed-up over classical algorithms. These
conditions can be used to develop new quantum algorithms more effectively (by
avoiding features that could allow the algorithm to be efficiently classically
simulated), as well as providing the potential to create new classical
algorithms (by using features which have proved valuable for quantum
algorithms).
  Results on many different methods of de-quantisations are presented, as well
as a general formal definition of de-quantisation. De-quantisations employing
higher-dimensional classical bits, as well as those using matrix-simulations,
put emphasis on entanglement in quantum algorithms; a key result is that any
algorithm in which the entanglement is bounded is de-quantisable. These methods
are contrasted with the stabiliser formalism de-quantisations due to the
Gottesman-Knill Theorem, as well as those which take advantage of the topology
of the circuit for a quantum algorithm.
  The benefits of the different methods are contrasted, and the importance of a
range of techniques is emphasised. We further discuss some features of quantum
algorithms which current de-quantisation methods do not cover.

high quality entanglement between the individual spins at the opposite ends of

how these phases and correlations among them are constrained by current EDM
limits. We also analyze the prospective implications of the next generation of

into account the complete set of contributions from one- and two-loop EDMs of
the electron and quarks, one- and two-loop Chromo-EDMs of quarks, the Weinberg

on a graph. Instead of distributing chips randomly, each vertex serves its
neighbors in a fixed order.
  Cooper and Spencer (Comb. Probab. Comput. (2006)) show a remarkable
similarity of both models. If an (almost) arbitrary population of chips is
placed on the vertices of a grid $\Z^d$ and does a simultaneous walk in the
Propp model, then at all times and on each vertex, the number of chips on this
vertex deviates from the expected number the random walk would have gotten
there by at most a constant. This constant is independent of the starting
configuration and the order in which each vertex serves its neighbors.
  This result raises the question if all graphs do have this property. With
quite some effort, we are now able to answer this question negatively. For the
graph being an infinite $k$-ary tree ($k \ge 3$), we show that for any
deviation $D$ there is an initial configuration of chips such that after
running the Propp model for a certain time there is a vertex with at least $D$
more chips than expected in the random walk model. However, to achieve a
deviation of $D$ it is necessary that at least $\exp(\Omega(D^2))$ vertices
contribute by being occupied by a number of chips not divisible by $k$ at a
certain time.

been carried out at half filling within dynamical mean field theory. In
agreement with previous studies, we find a zero temperature itinerant
metamagnetic transition, reflected in the discontinuous changes in
magnetization as well as in the hysteresis, from a paramagnetic (PM) metallic
state to a polarized quasi-ferromagnetic (QFM) state, at intermediate and large
interaction strength ($U$). The jump in magnetization vanishes smoothly with
decreasing interaction strength, and at a critical $U$, the transition becomes
continuous. The region of `coexistence' of the PM and QFM solutions in the
field-$U$ plane obtained in this study agrees quantitatively with recent
numerical renormalization group calculations, thus providing an important
benchmark. We highlight the changes in dynamics and quasiparticle weight across
this transition. The effective mass increases sharply as the transition is
approached, exhibiting a cusp-like singularity at the critical field,and
decreases with field monotonically beyond the transition. We conjecture that
the first order metamagnetic transition is a result of the competition between
Kondo screening, that tries to quench the local moments, and Zeeman coupling,
which induces polarization and hence promotes local moment formation. A
comparison of our theoretical results with experiments on $^{3}He$ indicate
that, a theory of $^{3}He$ based on the half-filled Hubbard model places it in
a regime of intermediate interaction strength.

areas of mathematics for a long time. Originally invented as the description of
the cohomology of homogeneous spaces it has to be redesigned when applied to
other generalized cohomology theories such as the equivariant, the quantum
cohomology, K-theory, and cobordism. All this cohomology theories are different
deformations of the ordinary cohomology. In this note we show that there is in
some sense the universal deformation of Schubert calculus which produces the
above mentioned by specialization of the appropriate parameters. We build on
the work of Lerche Vafa and Warner. The main conjecture there was that the
classical cohomology of a hermitian symmetric homogeneous manifold is a Jacobi
ring of an appropriate potential. We extend this conjecture and provide a
simple proof. Namely we show that the cohomology of the hermitian symmetric
space is a Jacobi ring of a certain potential and the equivariant and the
quantum cohomology and K-theory is a Jacobi ring of a particular deformation of
this potential. This suggests to study the most general deformations of the
Frobenius algebra of cohomology of these manifolds by considering the versal
deformation of the appropriate potential. The structure of the Jacobi ring of
such potential is a subject of well developed singularity theory. This gives a
potentially new way to look at the classical, the equivariant, the quantum and
other flavors of Schubert calculus.

precise data for rho electroproduction, including all spin density matrix
elements. From QCD, it is expected that such a process should factorize between
a hard (calculable) coefficient function, and hadronic (p and rho) matrix
elements. Such a factorization is up to now only proven for a longitudinaly

transoceanic antennas Hartebeesthoek in South Africa, the 6 m Transportable
Integrated Geodetic Observatory (TIGO) in Chile and the 9 m German Antarctic

resolution achieved at 8.4 GHz in the case of Cen A is 0.59mas x 0.978mas
(natural weighting) corresponding to a linear scale of less than 18

layered conductors leads to specific effects in an external magnetic field. The
magnetoresistance of layered conductors in a wide range of strong magnetic
fields directed in the plane of the layers can increase proportionally to a
magnetic field value. The electromagnetic impedance and the sound attenuation
rate depend essentially on the polarization of normal to the layers.
Propagation of electromagnetic and acoustic waves in these conductors involves
virtually all charge carriers in the transfer of acoustic pulses and
electromagnetic field spikes to the bulk of the conductor. The orbits of Fermi
electrons in a magnetic field are virtually indistinguishable, which allows the
inclusion of large number of conduction electrons in the formation of peculiar
oscillatory and resonant effects which are absent in the case of ordinary
metals. Investigation of these effects introduce the possibilities for detailed
study of the dissipative processes in electron systems of layered conductors
and the charge carriers energy spectrum. Point contact investigations of
layered metals allow us to obtain the information about electron and phonon
spectra. The electron focusing signal and the point contact spectrum are
extremely sensitive to the orientation of the magnetic field vector $\bs{H}$ in
relation to the layers with a high electrical conductivity. The values of
$\bs{H}$ for which the electron focusing signal has peaks can be used for
determining velocities and extremal diameters for the open Fermi surface. The

  Scientific Publishers (2004)",,,"cond-mat.stat-mech","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A series of kinetic phenomena in metallic multilayers has been considered.
The kinetic properties of multilayers differ essentially from the properties of
both massive metals and thin films. One of the main reasons of that is the
influence of electron interaction of electrons with interfaces between layers.
From one hand, this interaction leads to the additional electron scattering and
conductivity of multilayer may be noticeably less than specific conductivities
of composing metals. From the other hand, the electron reflection from
interfaces in a strong magnetic field may results in considerable increasing of
conducting properties in consequence of the static skin effect. Due to changing
of electron trajectories after collisions with interfaces new types of periodic
motion in the magnetic field and therefore new size and resonance phenomena in
high frequency fields appear. In thin normal layers on the superconducting
substrate, changing of trajectories is due to Andreev reflection and resonance
effects, which do not exist in normal multilayers, films, and bulk
monocrystals, take place. In multilayers consisting of ferromagnetic and
nonmagnetic metals, the internal magnetic field in ferromagnetic layers must be
taken into account, if the Larmor radius in this field is comparable with the
layer thickness. Because of the mutual diffusion of metals, the kinetic
coefficients of multilayers are changed in time. The investigation of this
changing may be used for determination of diffusion coefficient for the bulk
and grain-boundary diffusion. The effects, which have been analyzed
theoretically in this review, can be used for the obtaining information on the
electron interaction with interfaces in conducting multilayers.

number 0.0002<Ca<0.0023. When contact angle variations can be neglected at low
speeds (Re<8150), the velocity of the drop is much lower than that predicted by
the Ho. Young Kim's [6] relation. This observed discrepancy is overcome by
modifying Kim's relation by substituting the dissipation estimated from a
boundary layer near the solid surface instead of bulk dissipation. Based on the
changes at the rear side of the mercury droplet, there are three distinct
regimes identified with varying speeds of rotation (i) oval or rounded regime
(ii) corner regime and (iii) cusping regime. The oval to corner transition
happens at a finite receding contact angle of 950. The ratio of critical
contact angle ({\theta}c) at which the transition occurs to the static receding
contact angle ({\theta}s) was found to be 0.657. The de Gennes model [4],
extended to high contact angle by substituting the dissipation for wedge flow,
predicts a critical contact angle ratio ({\theta}c/{\theta}s) that is in close
agreement with the experimental value. At higher Re, the dynamic contact angle
variation with velocity was compared with Cox-Voinov model [3]. Though the
trend of the variation of data is approximately represented by the model, the
fit coefficient according to experimental data is very high when compared to
theoretical value.

universe that focus on the dynamical behavior of metal-free gas under different
initial and environmental conditions. In particular we investigate the role of
turbulence, which is thought to ubiquitously accompany the collapse of
high-redshift halos. We distinguish between two main cases: the birth of
Population III.1 stars - those which form in the pristine halos unaffected by
prior star formation - and the formation of Population III.2 stars - those
forming in halos where the gas is still metal free but has an increased
ionization fraction. This latter case can arise either from exposure to the
intense UV radiation of stellar sources in neighboring halos, or from the high
virial temperatures associated with the formation of massive halos, that is,
those with masses greater than 1e8 solar masses. We find that turbulent
primordial gas is highly susceptible to fragmentation in both cases, even for
turbulence in the subsonic regime, i.e. for rms velocity dispersions as low as
20 % of the sound speed. Contrary to our original expectations, fragmentation
is more vigorous and more widespread in pristine halos compared to pre-ionized
ones. We therefore predict Pop III.1 stars to be on average of somewhat lower
mass, and form in larger groups, than Pop III.2 stars. We find that fragment
masses cover over two orders of magnitude, indicating that the resulting
Population III initial mass function was significantly extended in mass as
well. This prompts the need for a large, high-resolution study of the formation
of dark matter minihalos that is capable of resolving the turbulent flows in
the gas at the moment when the baryons become self-gravitating. This would help
determine which, if any, of the initial conditions presented in our study are
realized in nature.

energies $\epsilon_{\vec r}$ and critical long-ranged hoppings decaying
typically as $V^{typ}(r) \sim V/r^d$, we show that the strong multifractality
regime corresponding to small $V$ can be studied via the standard perturbation
theory for eigenvectors in quantum mechanics. The Inverse Participation Ratios
$Y_q(L)$, which are the order parameters of Anderson transitions, can be
written in terms of weighted L\'evy sums of broadly distributed variables (as a
consequence of the presence of on-site random energies in the denominators of
the perturbation theory). We compute at leading order the typical and
disorder-averaged multifractal spectra $\tau_{typ}(q)$ and $\tau_{av}(q)$ as a
function of $q$. For $q<1/2$, we obtain the non-vanishing limiting spectrum
$\tau_{typ}(q)=\tau_{av}(q)=d(2q-1)$ as $V \to 0^+$. For $q>1/2$, this method
yields the same disorder-averaged spectrum $\tau_{av}(q)$ of order $O(V)$ as
obtained previously via the Levitov renormalization method by Mirlin and Evers
[Phys. Rev. B 62, 7920 (2000)]. In addition, it allows to compute explicitly
the typical spectrum, also of order $O(V)$, but with a different $q$-dependence
$\tau_{typ}(q) \ne \tau_{av}(q)$ for all $q>q_c=1/2$. As a consequence, we find
that the corresponding singularity spectra $f_{typ}(\alpha)$ and
$f_{av}(\alpha)$ differ even in the positive region $f>0$, and vanish at
different values $\alpha_+^{typ} > \alpha_+^{av}$, in contrast to the standard
picture. We also obtain that the saddle value $\alpha_{typ}(q)$ of the Legendre

$f_{typ}(\alpha_+^{typ})=0 $ only in the limit $q \to +\infty$.

However statistical inference under the coalescent model is extremely

exact representation for the DSS obtained by applying the Mori-type projection
technique for the relaxation function in terms of Hubbard operators. The static
spin susceptibility is evaluated by a sum-rule-conserving generalized
mean-field approximation, while the self-energy is calculated in the
mode-coupling approximation. The spectrum of spin excitations is studied in the
underdoped and optimally doped regions. The DSS reveals a resonance mode (RM)
at the antiferromagnetic wave vector Q = \pi(1,1) at low temperatures due to a
strong suppression of the damping of spin excitations. This is explained by an
involvement of spin excitations in the decay process besides the particle-hole
continuum usually considered in random-phase-type approximations. The spin gap
in the spin-excitation spectrum at Q plays a dominant role in limiting the

interest to finance and economic researchers. In this paper we introduce the
Motif Tracking Algorithm, a novel immune inspired pattern identification tool
that is able to identify unknown motifs of a non specified length which repeat
within time series data. The power of the algorithm comes from the fact that it
uses a small number of parameters with minimal assumptions regarding the data
being examined or the underlying motifs. Our interest lies in applying the
algorithm to financial time series data to identify unknown patterns that
exist. The algorithm is tested using three separate data sets. Particular
suitability to financial data is shown by applying it to oil price data. In all
cases the algorithm identifies the presence of a motif population in a fast and
efficient manner due to the utilisation of an intuitive symbolic
representation. The resulting population of motifs is shown to have
considerable potential value for other applications such as forecasting and
algorithm seeding.

simultaneously record the spiking activity of hundreds of neurons over large

the frequency of synchronous firing patterns. However, when the number of
neurons being observed grows they suffer from the combinatorial explosion in
the number of possible patterns and do not scale well. In this paper, we
present a temporal data mining scheme that overcomes many of these problems. It
generates a set of candidate patterns from frequent patterns of smaller size;
all possible patterns are not counted. Also we count only a certain well
defined subset of occurrences and this makes the process more efficient. We
highlight the computational advantage that this approach offers over the
existing methods through simulations.
  We also propose methods for assessing the statistical significance of the
discovered patterns. We detect only those patterns that repeat often enough to
be significant and thus be able to automatically fix the threshold for the

reported in the catalog. There were 8796 sources for which good quality
photometry was obtained in all four IRAC bands. For this sample, a preliminary
characterization of the young stellar population based on the determination of
spectral slope is discussed; combining this with diagnostics in the
color-magnitude and color-color diagrams, the relative population of young
stellar objects in the different evolutionary classes has been estimated and a
total of 637 candidate YSOs have been selected. The main differences in their

compared with the values derived for other star forming regions. Finally, an
analysis of the spatial distribution of the sources by means of the two-point

  Channels","To appear in IEEE Transactions on Information Theory",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper considers the problem of reliable communication over discrete-time
channels whose impulse responses have length $L$ and exactly $S\leq L$ non-zero
coefficients, and whose support and coefficients remain fixed over blocks of
$N>L$ channel uses but change independently from block to block. Here, it is
assumed that the channel's support and coefficient realizations are both
unknown, although their statistics are known. Assuming Gaussian
non-zero-coefficients and noise, and focusing on the high-SNR regime, it is
first shown that the ergodic noncoherent channel capacity has pre-log factor
$1-\frac{S}{N}$ for any $L$. It is then shown that, to communicate with
arbitrarily small error probability at rates in accordance with the capacity
pre-log factor, it suffices to use pilot-aided orthogonal frequency-division
multiplexing (OFDM) with $S$ pilots per fading block, in conjunction with an
appropriate noncoherent decoder. Since the achievability result is proven using
a noncoherent decoder whose complexity grows exponentially in the number of
fading blocks $K$, a simpler decoder, based on $S+1$ pilots, is also proposed.
Its $\epsilon$-achievable rate is shown to have pre-log factor equal to
$1-\frac{S+1}{N}$ with the previously considered channel, while its achievable
rate is shown to have pre-log factor $1-\frac{S+1}{N}$ when the support of the
block-fading channel remains fixed over time.

quantum-octave, providing a library of functions, which facilitates the
simulation of quantum computing. This package allows also to incorporate
high-level programming concepts into the simulation in GNU Octave and Matlab.
As such it connects features unique for high-level quantum programming
languages, with the full palette of efficient computational routines commonly
available in modern scientific computing systems. To present the major features
of the described package we provide the implementation of selected quantum
algorithms. We also show how quantum errors can be taken into account during
the simulation of quantum algorithms using quantum-octave package. This is
possible thanks to the ability to operate on density matrices.

publications which do offer advice on reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
but to find the advice the reader seeks will involve reading a lot of
irrelevant material. This work built an expert system (which we call
EcoHomeHelper) and attempted to show that it is useful in changing people's
behaviour with respect to their GHG emissions and that they will be able to
find the information in a more efficient manner. Twelve participants were used.
Seven of which used the program and five who read and attempted to find advice

of fast particles through a field of scatterers, modeled by bounded, localized,

Lorentz gases. We illustrate the wide applicability of a random walk picture
previously developed for a field of scatterers with random spatial and/or
time-dependence by applying it to four other models. First, for a periodic
array of spherical scatterers in $d\geq2$, with a smooth (quasi)periodic
time-dependence, we show Fermi acceleration: the ensemble averaged kinetic
energy $\left<\|p(t)\|^2\right>$ grows as $t^{2/5}$. Nevertheless, the mean
squared displacement $\left<\|q(t)\|^2\right>\sim t^2$ behaves ballistically.
These are the same growth exponents as for random time-dependent scatterers.
Second, we show that in the soft elastic and periodic Lorentz gas, where the
particles' energy is conserved, the motion is diffusive, as in the standard
hard Lorentz gas, but with a diffusion constant that grows as $\|p_0\|^{5}$,
rather than only as $\|p_0\|$. Third, we note the above models can also be
viewed as pulsed rotors: the latter are therefore unstable in dimension $d\geq
2$. Fourth, we consider kicked rotors, and prove them, for sufficiently strong
kicks, to be unstable in all dimensions with $\left<\|p(t)\|^2\right>\sim t$
and $\left<\|q(t)\|^2\right>\sim t^3$. Finally, we analyze the singular case
$d=1$, where $\left< \|p(t)\|^2\right>$ remains bounded in time for
time-dependent non-random potentials whereas it grows at the same rate as above

just two characteristic timescales within the dynamics of a single pair of

one particle as well as between both particles. Moreover, the shear rate enters
as a quadratic correction to the well-known correlations of random

solid particles, with flat surface density profile, both analytically and
numerically. We find that the corresponding migration rate is too small to
explain the observed variations of the propeller's orbit in Saturn's A-ring.
  However, local density fluctuations (due to gravity wakes in the marginally
gravitationally stable A-ring) may exert a stochastic torque on a moonlet. Our
simulations show that this torque can be large enough to account for the
observations, depending on the parameters of the rings. We find that on time
scales of several years the migration of propellers is likely to be dominated
by stochastic effects (while the former, non-stochastic migration dominates
after ~ 10^{4-5} years). In that case, the migration rates provided by
observations so far suggests that the surface density of the A ring should be
of the order of 700 kg/m^2. The age of the propellers shouldn't exceed 1 to 100
million years, depending on the dominant migration regime.

strength maps for 48 early-type galaxies from the SAURON sample. Using the line
strength index maps of Hbeta, Fe5015, and Mgb, measured in the Lick/IDS system
and spatially binned to a constant signal-to-noise, together with predictions
from up-to-date stellar population models, we estimate the simple stellar
population-equivalent (SSP-equivalent) age, metallicity and abundance ratio
[alpha/Fe] over a two-dimensional field extending up to approximately one
effective radius. We find a large range of SSP-equivalent ages in our sample,
of which ~40% of the galaxies show signs of a contribution from a young stellar
population. The most extreme cases of post-starburst galaxies, with
SSP-equivalent ages of <=3 Gyr observed over the full field-of-view, and
sometimes even showing signs of residual star-formation, are restricted to low
mass systems(sigma_e <= 100 k/ms or ~2x10^10 M_sol). Spatially restricted cases
of young stellar populations in circumnuclear regions can almost exclusively be
linked to the presence of star-formation in a thin, dusty disk/ring, also seen
in the near-UV or mid-IR. The flattened components with disk-like kinematics
previously identified in all fast rotators (Krajnovi\'c et al.) are shown to be
connected to regions of distinct stellar populations. These range from the
young, still star-forming circumnuclear disks and rings with increased
metallicity preferentially found in intermediate-mass fast rotators, to
apparently old structures with extended disk-like kinematics, which are
observed to have an increased metallicity and mildly depressed [alpha/Fe] ratio
compared to the main body of the galaxy. The slow rotators generally show no
stellar population signatures over and above the well known metallicity
gradients and are largely consistent with old (>=10 Gyr) stellar populations.

stationary stochastic process does not have a compact support, data sampled
from that process at any uniform sampling rate leads to biased and inconsistent
spectrum estimators. In a recent paper, the authors showed that the smoothed
periodogram estimator can be consistent, if the sampling interval is allowed to
shrink to zero at a suitable rate as the sample size goes to infinity. In this
paper, this `shrinking asymptotics' approach is used to obtain the limiting
distribution of the smoothed periodogram estimator of spectra and
cross-spectra. It is shown that, under suitable conditions, the scaling that
ensures weak convergence of the estimator to a limiting normal random vector
can range from cube-root of the sample size to square-root of the sample size,
depending on the strength of the assumption made. The results are used to
construct asymptotic confidence intervals for spectra and cross spectra. It is
shown through a Monte-Carlo simulation study that these intervals have
appropriate empirical coverage probabilities at moderate sample sizes.

ten nuclei with the standard magic numbers of both neutrons and protons have so
far been observed. The nuclear shell model is founded on the precept that
neutrons and protons can move as independent particles in orbitals with
discrete quantum numbers, subject to a mean field generated by all the other
nucleons. Knowledge of the properties of single-particle states outside nuclear
shell closures in exotic nuclei is important for a fundamental understanding of
nuclear structure and nucleosynthesis (for example the r-process, which is
responsible for the production of about half of the heavy elements). However,
as a result of their short lifetimes, there is a paucity of knowledge about the
nature of single-particle states outside exotic doubly magic nuclei. Here we
measure the single-particle character of the levels in 133Sn that lie outside
the double shell closure present at the short-lived nucleus 132Sn. We use an
inverse kinematics technique that involves the transfer of a single nucleon to
the nucleus. The purity of the measured single-particle states clearly

to the detection of microbial metabolism on the surface of Mars, the search for
nonspecific methods to detect life in situ has been one of the goals of
astrobiology. It is usually required that the methodology can detect life
independently from its composition or form, and that the chosen biological
signature points to a feature common to all living systems, as the presence of
metabolism. In this paper we evaluate the use of Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs)
for the detection of microbial life in situ. MFCs are electrochemical devices
originally developed as power electrical sources, and can be described as fuel
cells in which the anode is submerged in a medium that contains microorganisms.
These microorganisms, as part of their metabolic process, oxidize organic
material releasing electrons that contribute to the electric current, which is
therefore proportional to metabolic and other redox processes. We show that
power and current density values measured in MFCs using microorganism cultures
or soil samples in the anode are much larger than those obtained using a medium
free of microorganisms or sterilized soil samples, respectively. In particular,
we found that this is true for extremophiles, usually proposed to live in
extraterrestrial environments. Therefore, our results show that MFCs have the
potential to be used to detect microbial life in situ.

each player to whom she or he is connected by an arc. The team wins if at least
one player guesses his hat color correctly, and no one guesses his hat color
wrong; otherwise the team loses. The team aims to maximize the probability of a

charged-current scattering on nucleus are analyzed. It is shown that the
flux-integrated differential cross sections are nuclear model-independent. We
calculate these cross sections using the relativistic distorted-wave impulse
approximation and relativistic Fermi gas model with the Booster Neutrino
Beamline flux and compare results with the recent MiniBooNE experiment data.
Within these models an axial mass $M_A$ is extracted from a fit of the measured
$d\sigma/dQ^2$ cross section. The extracted value of $M_A$ is consistent with
the MiniBooNE result. The measured and calculated double differential cross
sections $d\sigma/dTd\cos\theta$ generally agree within the error of the
experiment. But the Fermi gas model predictions are completely off of the data
in the region of low muon energies and scattering angles.

${\bf{X}}=\{(X_{n,1},\ldots,X_{n,d})\}_{n\geq 1}$ is introduced and its main
properties are derived, namely the relations with the multivariate extremal
index and the clustering of upcrossings. Under asymptotic independence
conditions on the marginal sequences of ${\bf{X}}$ the multivariate upcrossings
index is obtained from the marginal upcrossings indices. For a class of
stationary multidimensional sequences assumed to satisfy a mild oscillation
restriction, the multivariate upcrossings index is computed from the joint
distribution of a finite number of variables. The upcrossings index is
calculated for two examples of bivariate sequences.

non-uniformities, it generates an anisotropic turbulent velocity/vorticity
field. This turbulence plays an important role at the early stages of the
mixing process in the compressed fluid. This situation emerges naturally in
shock interaction with weakly inhomogeneous deuterium-wicked foam targets in
Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) and with density clumps/clouds in
astrophysics. We present an exact small-amplitude linear theory describing such
interaction. It is based on the exact theory of time and space evolution of the
perturbed quantities behind a corrugated shock front for a single-mode
pre-shock non-uniformity. Appropriate mode averaging in 2D results in closed
analytical expressions for the turbulent kinetic energy, degree of anisotropy
of velocity and vorticity fields in the shocked fluid, shock amplification of
the density non-uniformity, and sonic energy flux radiated downstream. These
explicit formulas are further simplified in the important asymptotic limits of
weak/strong shocks and highly compressible fluids. A comparison with the
related problem of a shock interacting with a pre-shock isotropic vorticity
field is also presented.

this paper we identify the subspaces of $ L^2 (\mathbb{R}) $ generated by these

objectives, the analysis of stable outcomes typically depends on player types.
A special case is when a large part of the player population consists of
imitation types: that of players who imitate choice of other (optimizing)
types. Game theorists typically study the evolution of such games in dynamical
systems with imitation rules. In the setting of games of infinite duration on
finite graphs with preference orderings on outcomes for player types, we
explore the possibility of imitation as a viable strategy. In our setup, the
optimising players play bounded memory strategies and the imitators play
according to specifications given by automata. We present algorithmic results
on the eventual survival of types.
