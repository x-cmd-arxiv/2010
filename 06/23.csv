various image acquisition techniques on the derived clump mass function. In
particular, we focus on the effects of finite image angular resolution, the
presence of noise, and spatial filtering. We find that, even when the image has
been so heavily degraded with added noise and lowered angular resolution that
the clumps it contains clearly no longer correspond to pre-stellar cores, still
the clump mass function is typically consistent with the stellar initial mass
function within their mutual uncertainties. We explain this result by
suggesting that noise, source blending, and spatial filtering all randomly
perturb the clump masses, biasing the mass function toward a lognormal form
whose high-mass end mimics a Salpeter power law. We argue that this is a
consequence of the central limit theorem and that it strongly limits our
ability to accurately measure the true mass function of the clumps. We support
this conclusion by showing that the characteristic mass scale of the clump mass
function, represented by the ``break mass'', scales as a simple function of the
angular resolution of the image from which the clump mass function is derived.
This strongly constrains our ability to use the clump mass function to derive a
star formation efficiency. We discuss the potential and limitations of the
current and next generation of instruments for measuring the clump mass
function.

southwest. By using the Rankine--Hugoniot jump conditions for shocks, the Mach
number and the infall velocity of the subcluster are obtained as 1.5 +/- 0.2

between the A 85 and the subcluster obtained from optical observations, the
angle between the line of sight and the direction of the motion of the

energy of the subcluster and the energy used for intracluster medium (ICM)

when the acquired image has been damaged by shadows due to clouds, or
information gaps produced by sensor failure.
  The general approach for imputation of missing data, that could not be
considered missed at random, suggests the use of other available data. Previous
work, like local linear histogram matching, take advantage of a co-registered
older image obtained by the same sensor, yielding good results in filling
homogeneous regions, but poor results if the scenes being combined have radical
differences in target radiance due, for example, to the presence of sun glint
or snow.
  This study proposes three different alternatives for filling the data gaps.
The first two involves merging radiometric information from a lower resolution
image acquired at the same time, in the Fourier domain (Method A), and using
linear regression (Method B). The third method consider segmentation as the
main target of processing, and propose a method to fill the gaps in the map of
classes, avoiding direct imputation (Method C).
  All the methods were compared by means of a large simulation study,
evaluating performance with a multivariate response vector with four measures:
Q, RMSE, Kappa and Overall Accuracy coefficients. Difference in performance
were tested with a MANOVA mixed model design with two main effects, imputation
method and type of lower resolution extra data, and a blocking third factor
with a nested sub-factor, introduced by the real Landsat image and the
sub-images that were used. Method B proved to be the best for all criteria.

and still not be detected. Despite the simplicity with which the problem can be
stated, the solution involves complex statistical issues that require careful
analysis. In contrast to the confidence bound, this concept has never been
formally analyzed, leading to a great variety of often ad hoc solutions. Here
we formulate and describe the problem in a self-consistent manner. Detection
significance is usually defined by the acceptable proportion of false positives
(the TypeI error), and we invoke the complementary concept of false negatives
(the TypeII error), based on the statistical power of a test, to compute an
upper limit to the detectable source intensity. To determine the minimum
intensity that a source must have for it to be detected, we first define a
detection threshold, and then compute the probabilities of detecting sources of
various intensities at the given threshold. The intensity that corresponds to
the specified TypeII error probability defines that minimum intensity, and is
identified as the upper limit. Thus, an upper limit is a characteristic of the
detection procedure rather than the strength of any particular source and
should not be confused with confidence intervals or other estimates of source
intensity. This is particularly important given the large number of catalogs
that are being generated from increasingly sensitive surveys. We discuss the
differences between these upper limits and confidence bounds. Both measures are
useful quantities that should be reported in order to extract the most science
from catalogs, though they answer different statistical questions: an upper
bound describes an inference range on the source intensity, while an upper
limit calibrates the detection process. We provide a recipe for computing upper
limits that applies to all detection algorithms.

in which a frozen world, ""snowball"" style, with liquid water at the bottom of

a frozen Archean Eon. Results: Reinterpretation of the evidence shows that life
could appear within the oceanic depths and not necessarily on the surface. The
evaporitic sediments could have formed by saline saturation of the water
enclosed in the limited cavities of liquid water located at the bottom of the
ocean. Also, the terrigenous sediments could have been formed by catastrophic
currents of liquid water due to the fusion of the ice from the sub glacial
volcanoes. From the mathematical model it is deduced that the defrosting moment
of the Earth is towards the end of the Proterozoic, moment in which the

(CME) and its interaction with the coronal magnetic field based on the May 12,

corona. The ambient solar wind steady-state solution is driven by photospheric
magnetic field data, while the solar eruption is obtained by superimposing an
unstable flux rope onto the steady-state solution. During the initial stage of
CME expansion, the core flux rope reconnects with the neighboring field, which
facilitates lateral expansion of the CME footprint in the low corona. The flux
rope field also reconnects with the oppositely orientated overlying magnetic
field in the manner of the breakout model. During this stage of the eruption,
the simulated CME rotates counter-clockwise to achieve an orientation that is
in agreement with the interplanetary flux rope observed at 1 AU. A significant
component of the CME that expands into interplanetary space comprises one of
the side lobes created mainly as a result of reconnection with the overlying
field. Within 3 hours, reconnection effectively modifies the CME connectivity
from the initial condition where both footpoints are rooted in the active
region to a situation where one footpoint is displaced into the quiet Sun, at a
significant distance ($\approx 1R_\odot$) from the original source region. The
expansion and rotation due to interaction with the overlying magnetic field
stops when the CME reaches the outer edge of the helmet streamer belt, where
the field is organized on a global scale. The simulation thus offers a new view
of the role reconnection plays in rotating a CME flux rope and transporting its
footpoints while preserving its core structure.

its own because it gives the first provable hardness separation between
prize-collecting and non-prize-collecting (regular) versions of the problems:
regular Steiner Forest is known to be polynomially solvable on series-parallel
graphs and admits a PTAS on graphs of bounded treewidth. An analogous hardness
result can be shown for Euclidian PCSF. This ends the common belief that
prize-collecting variants should not add any new hardness to the problems.

promising examples of hierarchically structured soft materials, comprising
ordered networks of defect lines (disclinations) within a liquid crystalline

starting from a blue phase nucleus within a supercooled isotropic or
cholesteric background. The nucleated phase is thermodynamically stable; one
expects its slow orderly growth, creating a bulk cubic. Instead, we find that
the strong propensity to form disclinations drives the rapid disorderly growth
of a metastable amorphous defect network. During this process the original

second nucleation step. Our findings suggest that blue phases exhibit
hierarchical behavior in their ordering dynamics, to match that in their

method for taking into account the many-body structure in the three-body decay

flux, mediated via processes such as diffusion, differential rotation and
meridional circulation is believed to be responsible for the reversal of the
Sun's polar field. This process (commonly known as the Babcock-Leighton
mechanism) is usually modeled as a near-surface, spatially distributed
$\alpha$-effect in kinematic mean-field dynamo models. However, this
formulation leads to a relationship between polar field strength and meridional
flow speed which is opposite to that suggested by physical insight and
predicted by surface flux-transport simulations. With this in mind, we present
an improved double-ring algorithm for modeling the Babcock-Leighton mechanism
based on active region eruption, within the framework of an axisymmetric dynamo
model. Using surface flux-transport simulations we first show that an
axisymmetric formulation -- which is usually invoked in kinematic dynamo models
-- can reasonably approximate the surface flux dynamics. Finally, we
demonstrate that our treatment of the Babcock-Leighton mechanism through
double-ring eruption leads to an inverse relationship between polar field
strength and meridional flow speed as expected, reconciling the discrepancy
between surface flux-transport simulations and kinematic dynamo models.

determine the underlying nature of these flux-flux relationships. First, we use
statistical correlation and regression analysis and show that the relationships
are not monotonic for total solar irradiance and for continuum radiation from
the photosphere, but are approximately linear for chromospheric and coronal
radiation. Second, we use signal theory to examine the flux-flux relationships
for a temporal component. We find that a well-defined temporal component exists
and accounts for some of the variance in the data. This temporal component
arises because active regions with high magnetic field strength evolve,
breaking up into small-scale magnetic elements with low field strength, and
radiative and magnetic fluxes are sensitive to different active-region
components. We generate empirical models that relate radiative flux to magnetic
flux, allowing us to predict spectral-irradiance variations from observations
of disk-averaged magnetic-flux density. In most cases, the model
reconstructions can account for 85-90% of the variability of the radiative flux
from the chromosphere and corona. Our results are important for understanding
the relationship between magnetic and radiative measures of solar and stellar

  redundancy",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The use of channel output feedback to improve the reliability of fading
channels has received scant attention in the literature. In most work on
feedback for fading channels, only channel state information (CSI) feedback has
been exploited for coding at the transmitter. In this work, the design of a
coding scheme for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) fading systems with
channel output and channel state feedback at the transmitter is considered.
Under the assumption of additive white Gaussian noise and an independent and
identically distributed fading process, a simple linear coding strategy that
achieves any rate up to capacity is proposed. The framework assumes perfect CSI
at the transmitter and receiver. This simple linear processing scheme can
provide a doubly exponential probability of error decay with blocklength for
all rates less than capacity. Remarkably, this encoding scheme actually
consists of two separate encoding blocks: one that adapts to the current CSI
and one that adapts to the previous channel output feedback. This scheme is
extended to the case when the CSI is quantized at the receiver and conveyed to
the transmitter over a limited rate feedback channel; for multiple-input
single-output (MISO) fading systems it is shown the doubly exponential
probability of error decay is achieved as the blocklength increases.

selected sources in the Bootes field of the NOAO Deep Wide-Field Survey. This
sample provides the best available combination of large area (9 deg^2), depth,
and statistically complete spectroscopic observations, allowing us to probe the
evolution of the 24 micron LF of galaxies at low and intermediate redshifts
while minimizing the effects of cosmic variance. In order to use the observed
24 micron luminosity as a tracer for star formation, active galactic nuclei
(AGNs) that could contribute significantly at 24 micron are identified and
excluded from our star-forming galaxy sample based on their mid-IR spectral
energy distributions or the detection of X-ray emission. The evolution of the
24 micron LF of star-forming galaxies for redshifts of z < 0.65 is consistent
with a pure luminosity evolution where the characteristic 24 micron luminosity
evolves as (1+z)^(3.8+/-0.3). We extend our evolutionary study to encompass 0.0
< z < 1.2 by combining our data with that of the Far-Infrared Deep
Extragalactic Legacy Survey. Over this entire redshift range the evolution of
the characteristic 24 micron luminosity is described by a slightly shallower
power law of (1+z)^(3.4+/-0.2). We find a local star formation rate density of
(1.09+/-0.21) x 10^-2 Msun/yr/Mpc^-3, and that it evolves as (1+z)^(3.5+/-0.2)
over 0.0 < z < 1.2. These estimates are in good agreement with the rates using
optical and UV fluxes corrected for the effects of intrinsic extinction in the
observed sources. This agreement confirms that star formation at z <~ 1.2 is
robustly traced by 24 micron observations and that it largely occurs in
obscured regions of galaxies. (Abridged)

the wider area ERS (~27.5 AB mag) ~40 arcmin**2). The application of strict
optical non-detection criteria ensures the contamination fraction is kept low
(just ~7% in the HUDF). This very low value includes a full assessment of the
contamination from lower redshift sources, photometric scatter, AGN, spurious
sources, low mass stars, and transients (e.g., SNe). From careful modelling of
the selection volumes for each of our search fields we derive luminosity
functions for galaxies at z~7 and z~8 to <-18 AB mag. The faint-end slopes
alpha at z~7 and z~8 are uncertain but very steep at alpha = -2.01+/-0.21 and
alpha=-1.91+/-0.32, respectively. Such steep slopes contrast to the local
alpha<~-1.4 and may even be steeper than that at z~4 where alpha=-1.73+/-0.05.
With such steep slopes (alpha<~-1.7) lower luminosity galaxies dominate the
galaxy luminosity density during the epoch of reionization. The star formation
rate densities derived from these new z~7 and z~8 luminosity functions are
consistent with the trends found at later times (lower redshifts). We find
reasonable consistency, with the SFR densities implied from reported stellar
mass densities, being only ~40% higher at z<7. This suggests that (1) the
stellar mass densities inferred from the Spitzer IRAC photometry are reasonably
accurate and (2) that the IMF at very high redshift may not be very different
from that at later times.

Model (MSSM) is a good description of nature at the weak scale, the
experimental priority will be the precise determination of superpartner masses.
These masses are governed by the weak scale values of the soft supersymmetry
(SUSY)-breaking parameters, which are in turn highly dependent on the
SUSY-breaking scheme present at high scales. It is therefore of great interest
to find patterns in the soft parameters that can distinguish different high
scale SUSY-breaking structures, identify the scale at which the breaking is
communicated to the visible sector, and determine the soft breaking parameters
at that scale. In this work, we demonstrate that 1-loop Renormalization
Group~(RG) invariant quantities present in the MSSM may be used to answer each
of these questions. We apply our method first to generic flavor-blind models of
SUSY-breaking, and then examine in detail the subset of these models described
by General Gauge Mediation and the constrained MSSM with non-universal Higgs
masses. As RG invariance generally does not hold beyond leading-log order, we
investigate the magnitude and direction of the 2-loop corrections. We find that
with superpartners at the TeV scale, these 2-loop effects are either
negligible, or they are of the order of optimistic experimental uncertainties

duration of 40ns (sampled at 100fs intervals) in conjunction with an ET pathway
analysis to estimate the ET coupling strength of each configuration. In the
wild type complex, we find that the most frequently occurring molecular
configurations afford superior electronic coupling due to the consistent
presence of a water molecule hydrogen-bonded between the donor and acceptor
sites. We attribute the persistence of this water bridge to a ""molecular
breakwater"" composed of several hydrophobic residues surrounding the acceptor
site. The breakwater supports the function of nearby solvent-organizing
residues by limiting the exchange of water molecules between the sterically
constrained ET region and the more turbulent surrounding bulk. When the
breakwater is affected by a mutation, bulk solvent molecules disrupt the water
bridge, resulting in reduced electronic coupling that is consistent with recent
experimental findings. Our analysis suggests that, in addition to enabling the
association and docking of the proteins, surface residues stabilize and control
interprotein solvent dynamics in a concerted way.

involution allows us to define a nondegenerate bilinear form $<,>$ on a

that if $(Q,\sigma)$ is a symmetric quiver of finite type or of tame type then
the rings of semi-invariants for this action are spanned by the semi-invariants

the dominant central galaxy in a nearby galaxy group. The system shows three
pairs of collinear cavities at 1 kpc, 8 kpc, and 20 kpc from the central
source, from three distinct outbursts of the central AGN, which occurred
3x10^6, 2x10^7, and 9x10^7 yr ago. The H-alpha and X-ray observations reveal
filaments of cool gas that has been uplifted by the X-ray cavities. The inner
two cavity pairs are filled with radio emitting plasma, and each pair is
associated with an elliptical surface brightness edge, which we unambiguously
identify as shocks (with measured temperature jumps) with Mach numbers of M~1.7
and M~1.5 for the inner and outer shocks, respectively. Such clear signatures
from three distinct AGN outbursts in an otherwise dynamically relaxed system
provide a unique opportunity to study AGN feedback and outburst history. The
mean power of the two most recent outbursts differs by a factor of six, from
1.5--10x10^42 erg/s, indicating that the mean jet power changes significantly
over long (~10^7 yr) timescales. The total energy output of the most recent
outburst is also more than an order of magnitude less than the total energy of
the previous outburst (1.5x10^56 erg versus 4x10^57 erg), which may be a result
of the lower mean power, or may indicate that the most recent outburst is
ongoing. The outburst interval implied by both the shock and cavity ages (~10^7
yr) indicates that, in this system, shock heating alone is sufficient to
balance radiative cooling close to the central AGN, which is the relevant
region for regulating feedback between the ICM and the central SMBH.

promotes fairness, as an emergent property resulting from the self-organizing
market dynamics. Even though an individual employee may care only about his or
her salary and no one else's, the collective actions of all the employees,
combined with the profit maximizing actions of all the companies, in a free
market environment under budgetary constraints, lead towards a more fair
allocation of wages, guided by Adam Smith's invisible hand of
self-organization. By exploring deep connections with statistical
thermodynamics, we show that entropy is the appropriate measure of fairness in
a free market environment which is maximized at equilibrium to yield the
lognormal distribution of salaries as the fairest inequality of pay in an

find an increase in neutral hydrogen absorption within 5 h^-1 Mpc of a galaxy
in agreement with the results of Adelberger et al. (2003, 2005). The Lya-LBG
cross-correlation can be described by a power-law on scales larger than 3 h^-1
Mpc. When galaxy velocity dispersions are taken into account our results at
smaller scales (<2 h^-1 Mpc) are also in good agreement with the results of
Adelberger et al. (2005). There is little immediate indication of a region with
a transmission spike above the mean IGM value which might indicate the presence
of star-formation feedback. To measure the galaxy velocity dispersions, which
include both intrinsic LBG velocity dispersion and redshift errors, we have
used the LBG-LBG redshift space distortion measurements of Bielby et al.
(2010). We find that the redshift-space transmission spike implied in the
results of Adelberger et al. (2003) is too narrow to be physical in the
presence of the likely LBG velocity dispersion and is likely to be a
statistical fluke. Nevertheless, neither our nor previous data can rule out the
presence of a narrow, real-space transmission spike, given the evidence of the
increased Lya absorption surrounding LBGs which can mask the spike's presence
when convolved with a realistic LBG velocity dispersion. Finally, we identify
176 CIV systems in the quasar spectra and find an LBG-CIV correlation strength
on scales of 10 h^-1 Mpc consistent with the relation measured at ~Mpc scales.

decode-and-forward (DF) and amplify-and-forward (AF) relay beamforming designs
under total and individual relay power constraints are studied with the goal of
maximizing the secrecy rates when perfect channel state information (CSI) is
available. In the DF scheme, the total power constraint leads to a closed-form
solution, and in this case, the optimal beamforming structure is identified in
the low and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. The beamforming design
under individual relay power constraints is formulated as an optimization
problem which is shown to be easily solved using two different approaches,
namely semidefinite programming and second-order cone programming. A simplified
and suboptimal technique which reduces the computation complexity under
individual power constraints is also presented. In the AF scheme, not having
analytical solutions for the optimal beamforming design under both total and
individual power constraints, an iterative algorithm is proposed to numerically
obtain the optimal beamforming structure and maximize the secrecy rates.
Finally, robust beamforming designs in the presence of imperfect CSI are
investigated for DF-based relay beamforming, and optimization frameworks are
provided

are able to show that it is possible to make this model effectively error free.
We achieve this by using techniques in fault-tolerant classical computing and
the result is that the system can compute effectively error free if the
temperature is below a critical temperature. We further link this model to
computational complexity and show that a certain problem concerning finite

Merlin-Arthur. This provides an interesting connection between the physical

uncovered in the primitive CR chondrite Queen Elizabeth Range (QUE) 99177,
along with 13 presolar SiC grains and one presolar silicon nitride. The O

of the grains condensed in low-mass red giant and asymptotic giant branch
stars. Interestingly, unlike presolar oxides, few presolar silicate grains have
isotopic compositions pointing to low-metallicity, low-mass stars (Group 3).
The 18O-rich (Group 4) silicates, along with the few Group 3 silicates that
were identified, likely have origins in supernova outflows. This is supported
by their O and Si isotopic compositions. Elemental compositions for 74 presolar
silicate grains were determined by scanning Auger spectroscopy. Most of the
grains have non-stoichiometric elemental compositions inconsistent with
pyroxene or olivine, the phases commonly used to fit astronomical spectra, and
have comparable Mg and Fe contents. Non-equilibrium condensation and/or
secondary alteration could produce the high Fe contents. Transmission electron
microscopic analysis of three silicate grains also reveals non-stoichiometric
compositions, attributable to non-equilibrium or multistep condensation, and
very fine scale elemental heterogeneity, possibly due to subsequent annealing.
The mineralogies of presolar silicates identified in meteorites thus far seem
to differ from those in interplanetary dust particles.

explosions of carbon-oxygen white dwarfs with masses near the Chandrasekhar
mass. This scenario, however, has two long-standing problems. First, the
explosions do not naturally produce the correct mix of elements, but have to be
finely tuned to proceed from sub-sonic deflagration to super-sonic detonation.
Second, population models and observations give formation rates of
near-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs that are far too small. Here, we suggest that
type Ia supernovae instead result from mergers of roughly equal-mass
carbon-oxygen white dwarfs, including those that produce sub-Chandrasekhar mass
remnants. Numerical studies of such mergers have shown that the remnants
consist of rapidly rotating cores that contain most of the mass and are hottest
in the center, surrounded by dense, small disks. We argue that the disks
accrete quickly, and that the resulting compressional heating likely leads to
central carbon ignition. This ignition occurs at densities for which pure
detonations lead to events similar to type Ia supernovae. With this merger
scenario, we can understand the type Ia rates, and have plausible reasons for
the observed range in luminosity and for the bias of more luminous supernovae
towards younger populations. We speculate that explosions of white dwarfs
slowly brought to the Chandrasekhar limit---which should also occur---are
responsible for some of the ""atypical"" type Ia supernovae.

costs of medical treatment of the infected people but also on the costs related

as one encodes quantum information in a non-local fashion that the environment

operations---braiding of non-Abelian anyons---can be implemented in
one-dimensional semiconductor wire networks. Previous work [Lutchyn et al.,

semiconducting wires into a topological phase supporting long-sought particles
known as Majorana fermions that can store topologically protected quantum
information. Majorana fermions in this setting can be transported, created, and
fused by applying locally tunable gates to the wire. More importantly, we show
that networks of such wires allow braiding of Majorana fermions and that they
exhibit non-Abelian statistics like vortices in a p+ip superconductor. We
propose experimental setups that enable the Majorana fusion rules to be probed,
along with networks that allow for efficient exchange of arbitrary numbers of
Majorana fermions. This work paves a new path forward in topological quantum
computation that benefits from physical transparency and experimental realism.

occurs in gas-dynamic shocks which develop inside these tubes. Here we present
generalized thin flux tube equations for the dynamics of reconnected flux
tubes, including pressure-driven parallel dynamics as well as temperature
dependent, anisotropic viscosity and thermal conductivity. The evolution of
tubes embedded in a uniform, skewed magnetic field, following reconnection in a
patch, is studied through numerical solutions of these equations, for solar
coronal conditions. Even though viscosity and thermal conductivity are
negligible in the quiet solar corona, the strong gas-dynamic shocks generated
by compressing plasma inside reconnected flux tubes generate large velocity and
temperature gradients along the tube, rendering the diffusive processes
dominant. They determine the thickness of the shock that evolves up to a
steady-state value, although this condition may not be reached in the short
times involved in a flare. For realistic solar coronal parameters, this
steady-state shock thickness might be as long as the entire flux tube. For
strong shocks at low Prandtl numbers, typical of the solar corona, the
gas-dynamic shock consists of an isothermal sub-shock where all the compression
and cooling occur, preceded by a thermal front where the temperature increases
and most of the heating occurs. We estimate the length of each of these
sub-regions and the speed of their propagation.

providing high spectral efficiency in future broadband wireless systems. The
research over the last decade on adaptive OFDMA systems has focused on adapting
the allocation of radio resources, such as subcarriers and power, to the
instantaneous channel conditions of all users. However, such ""fast"" adaptation
requires high computational complexity and excessive signaling overhead. This
hinders the deployment of adaptive OFDMA systems worldwide. This paper proposes
a slow adaptive OFDMA scheme, in which the subcarrier allocation is updated on
a much slower timescale than that of the fluctuation of instantaneous channel
conditions. Meanwhile, the data rate requirements of individual users are
accommodated on the fast timescale with high probability, thereby meeting the
requirements except occasional outage. Such an objective has a natural chance
constrained programming formulation, which is known to be intractable. To
circumvent this difficulty, we formulate safe tractable constraints for the
problem based on recent advances in chance constrained programming. We then
develop a polynomial-time algorithm for computing an optimal solution to the
reformulated problem. Our results show that the proposed slow adaptation scheme
drastically reduces both computational cost and control signaling overhead when
compared with the conventional fast adaptive OFDMA. Our work can be viewed as
an initial attempt to apply the chance constrained programming methodology to
wireless system designs. Given that most wireless systems can tolerate an
occasional dip in the quality of service, we hope that the proposed methodology
will find further applications in wireless communications.

(WLAN) enjoys unique advantages in providing high-speed and low-cost wireless
services in hot spots and indoor environments. Traditional WLAN
medium-access-control (MAC) protocols assume that only one station can transmit
at a time: simultaneous transmissions of more than one station cause the
destruction of all packets involved. By exploiting recent advances in PHY-layer
multiuser detection (MUD) techniques, it is possible for a receiver to receive
multiple packets simultaneously. This paper argues that such multipacket
reception (MPR) capability can greatly enhance the capacity of future WLANs. In
addition, the paper provides the MAC-layer and PHY-layer designs needed to
achieve the improved capacity. First, to demonstrate MPR as a powerful
capacity-enhancement technique, we prove a ""super-linearity"" result, which
states that the system throughput per unit cost increases as the MPR capability
increases. Second, we show that the commonly deployed binary exponential
backoff (BEB) algorithm in today's WLAN MAC may not be optimal in an MPR
system, and that the optimal backoff factor increases with the MPR capability,
the number of packets that can be received simultaneously. Third, based on the
above insights, we design a joint MAC-PHY layer protocol for an IEEE

illustrate these methods by applying them to Brans-Dicke scalars, and their
generalization in which the scalar-matter coupling is a weak function of the

external to a spherically symmetric star (the stellar radius, R, mass, M,
scalar `charge', Q, and the scalar's asymptotic value, phi_infty) are subject
to two relations because of the matching to the interior solution, generalizing
the usual mass-radius, M(R), relation of General Relativity. We identify how
these relations depend on the microscopic scalar couplings, agreeing with
earlier workers when comparisons are possible. Explicit analytical solutions
are obtained for the instructive toy model of constant-density stars, whose

forms of the equations of motion in the particular cases of coupling to a

All galaxies are matched with the SDSS DR7 and GALEX DR4.
  The inclusion of Fuv or Nuv or both photometry decreases the number of
catastrophic identifications (CIs, |z_phot -z_spec| > 1.0). If CIs are removed,
the inclusion of both Fuv and Nuv photometry mainly increases the number of
non-CIs in the low redshift, g-r < 0.8 and fainter r-magnitude regions. The
inclusion of binary interactions (BIs) mainly increases the number of non-CIs
and decreases the deviations in the 0.3 < g-r < 0.8 region in the case of only
using optical photometry.
  The inclusion of UV photometry would decrease and increase the probability
that early types are classified as Burst and E types, respectively, and
increase that late types are classified as CWW-Sbc and CWW-Scd types. If CIs
are excluded, the inclusion of UV data mainly raises the identifications of
late types in all redshift, bluer g-r and r > 14 regions. Moreover, BIs mainly
affect the determinations of E and S0 types.
  Nuv -u = 1.94 and 5.77-1.47(u-r) = Fuv discriminators can be used as
morphology selection indicators. These two criteria have comparable reliability

Coefficients of such expansions are integrals over products of Bessel functions

involving products of two and three general solutions of Bessel's equation have
been derived. Some of these identities have been useful in the study of Turner
relaxation of annular magnetized plasma [S.K.H. Auluck, Phys. Plasmas, 16,

general solution of Bessel's equation, allowing their determination by a
minimization procedure. Identities involving products of three solutions enable
expanding a product of two solutions in a Fourier-Bessel series of single

eliminating spatial dependences. These identities are required in an ongoing

difficult in special situations. This can especially be true for the Q-range
from around 0.1-0.5 \AA^-1 where improper knowledge of the background level can
lead to ambiguity in determination of the samples structure parameters.
Polarization analysis is a way of removing this ambiguity by allowing one to
distinguish the coherent from incoherent scattering, even when the coherent
scattering is only a small fraction of the total scattered intensity. ^3He spin
filters are ideal for accomplishing this task because they permit the analysis
of large area and large divergence scattered neutron beams without adding to
detector background or changing the prorogation of the scattered neutron beam.

continuum intensity is well correlated with N_{HI}, 100 $\mu$m, and H-alpha
intensities but anti-correlated with soft X-ray. The correlation of the diffuse
background with the direct stellar flux is weaker than the correlation with
other parameters. The continuum spectra are relatively flat. However, a weak
softening of the FUV spectra toward some sight lines, mostly at high Galactic
latitudes, is found not only in direct-stellar but also in diffuse background
spectra. The diffuse background is relatively softer that the direct stellar
spectrum. We also find that the diffuse FUV background averaged over the sky
has about the same level as the direct-stellar radiation field in the
statistical sense and a bit softer spectrum compared to direct stellar
radiation. A map of the ratio of 1400-1510A to 1560-1660A shows that the sky is
divided into roughly two parts. However, this map shows a lot of patchy
structures on small scales. The spatial variation of the hardness ratio seems
to be largely determined by the longitudinal distribution of spectral types of
stars in the Galactic plane. A correlation of the hardness ratio with the FUV

Nuclei (AGN) is a common feature of these objects. Recent work has looked at
the effect of the dust component of the gas, and how it enhances radiation
pressure such that dusty gas can have a lower effective Eddington limit than
ionised gas. In this work, we use multi-wavelength data and X-ray spectra from
the 2 Ms exposures of the Chandra Deep Field North and Chandra Deep Field South
surveys, to characterise the AGN in terms of their Eddington ratio and hydrogen
column density. Their distributions are then compared with what is predicted
when considering the coupling between dust and gas. Our final sample consists
of 234 objects from both fields, the largest and deepest sample of AGN for
which this comparison has been made up to date. We find that most of the AGN in
our sample tend to be found at low Eddington ratios (typically between 1e-4 and
1e-1) and high column density (>1e22 cm^-2), with black hole masses between
~1e8 and 1e9 solar masses. Their distribution is in agreement with that
expected from the enhanced radiation pressure model, avoiding the area where we
would predict the presence of outflows. We also investigate how the balance
between AGN radiation pressure and gravitational potential influences the
behaviour of clouds in the galactic bulge, and describe a scenario where an
enhanced radiation pressure can lead to the fundamental plane of black
hole/galaxy scaling relations.

contaminating light. A contamination of 5% is enough to make the measurement of
a planetary radius 2% too low. The physical properties of the 30 transiting

best match to their measured quantities. The error budgets are used to compile
a list of systems which would benefit from additional observations. The
systematic errors arising from the inclusion of stellar models are assessed by
using five different theoretical models. This model dependence sets a lower
limit on the accuracy of measurements of the system properties, and at worst is
1% for the stellar mass. The correlations of planetary surface gravity and mass
with orbital period have significance levels of only 3.1 sigma and 2.3 sigma.

in the normal state, the highest transition temperature $T_c$ of 14.5 K, and
the largest heat-capacity anomaly at $T_c$ were obtained for pure (oxygen-free)
samples. The critical current density $j_c$ of $8 \times 10^4$ A/cm$^2$ (at 2
K) achieved in pure samples is attributed to intrinsic inhomogeneity due to
disorder at the cation and anion sites. The impure samples show increased $j_c$
up to $2.3 \times 10^5$ A/cm$^2$ due to additional pinning centers of
Fe$_3$O$_4$. The upper critical field $H_{c2}$ of $\sim 500$ kOe is estimated
from the resistivity study in magnetic fields parallel to the \emph{c}-axis.
The anisotropy of the upper critical field $\gamma_{H_{c2}} =

3.9<z<6.4 to investigate the properties of dust extinction at these cosmic
epochs. The SMC extinction curve has been shown to reproduce the dust reddening
of most quasars at z<2.2; we investigate whether this curve also provides a
good description of dust extinction at higher redshifts. We fit the observed
spectra with synthetic absorbed quasar templates obtained by varying the
intrinsic slope (alpha), the absolute extinction (A3000), and by using a grid
of empirical and theoretical extinction curves. We find that seven quasars in
our sample are affected by substantial extinction (A3000 >0.8), and
characterized by very steep intrinsic slopes (alpha<-2.3). All of the
individual quasars require extinction curve deviating from that of the SMC,
with a tendency to flatten at lambda<2000 A (in the rest frame of the source).
We obtain a mean extinction curve at z>4, both by performing a simultaneous fit
of all quasars and by averaging the extinction curves inferred for individual
quasars. In the case of broad absorption line quasars the mean extinction curve
deviates from the SMC at a confidence level >95%. The difference between
extinction curves in quasars at z>4 and in quasars at lower redshift is
indicative of either a different dust production mechanism at high redshift, or
a different mechanism for processing dust into the ISM. We suggest that the
same transitions may also apply to normal, star-forming galaxies at z>4. In
particular, the observed change in the average spectral slope of galaxies at
z>4 may be partially ascribed to a variation in the extinction curve, rather
than a lower dust content at high redshift. In this scenario, the extinction
curve inferred at z>4 would imply a cosmic star-formation corrected for dust
attenuation a factor of ~2 higher than estimated in the past.

into short-duration and long-duration bursts, which presumably reflect two
different types of progenitors. However, it has been shown on statistical
grounds that a third, intermediate population is needed in this classification
scheme, although an extensive study of the properties of this class has so far
not been done. The large amount of follow-up studies generated during the Swift
era allows us to have a suficient sample to attempt a study of this third
population through the properties of their prompt emission and their
afterglows. Our study is focused on a sample of GRBs observed by Swift during
its first four years of operation. The sample contains those bursts with
measured redshift since this allows us to derive intrinsic properties.
Intermediate bursts are less energetic and have dimmer afterglows than long
GRBs, especially when considering the X-ray light curves, which are on average
one order of magnitude fainter than long bursts. There is a less significant
trend in the redshift distribution that places intermediate bursts closer than
long bursts. Except for this, intermediate bursts show similar properties to
long bursts. In particular, they follow the Epeak vs. Eiso correlation and
have, on average, positive spectral lags with a distribution similar to that of
long bursts. Like long GRBs, they normally have an associated supernova,
although some intermediate bursts have shown no supernova component. This study
shows that intermediate bursts are different from short bursts and, in spite of
sharing many properties with long bursts, there are some differences between
them as well. We suggest that the physical difference between intermediate and
long bursts could be that for the first the ejecta are thin shells while for
the latter they are thick shells.

is devoted to an extensive study on the non-Abelian topological phase of
spin-singlet superconductors with the Rashba spin-orbit interaction proposed in
our previous letter [M. Sato, Y. Takahashi, and S. Fujimoto, Phys. Rev. Lett.

almost all parameter regions of the mixed state under an applied magnetic
field, provided that the Fermi level crosses k-points in the vicinity of the
Gamma point or the M point in the Brillouin zone, while in the case of s-wave
pairing, a strong magnetic field, the Zeeman energy of which is larger than the
superconducting gap is required to realize the topological phase. We clarify
that Majorana fermions in Rashba spin-singlet superconductors are much more
stable than those realized in spin-triplet p+ip superconductors in certain
parameter regions. We also investigate the topological number which ensures the
topological stability of the phase in detail. Furthermore, as a byproduct, we
found that topological order is also realized in conventional spin (or charge)
density wave states with the Rashba spin-orbit interaction, for which massless

In the double detonation scenario for Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) a
detonation initiates in a shell of He-rich material accreted from a companion
star by a sub-Chandrasekhar-mass White Dwarf (WD). This shell detonation drives
a shock front into the carbon-oxygen (C/O) WD that triggers a secondary
detonation in the core. The core detonation results in a complete disruption of
the WD. Earlier studies concluded that this scenario has difficulties in
accounting for the observed properties of SNe Ia since the explosion ejecta are
surrounded by the products of explosive He burning in the shell. Recently, it
was proposed that detonations might be possible for much less massive He shells
than previously assumed. Moreover, it was shown that even detonations of these
minimum He shell masses robustly trigger detonations of the C/O core. Here we
present time-dependent multi-wavelength radiative transfer calculations for
models with minimum He shell mass and derive synthetic observables for both the
optical and {\gamma}-ray spectral regions. These differ strongly from those
found in earlier simulations of sub-Chandrasekhar-mass explosions in which more
massive He shells were considered. Our models predict light curves which cover
both the range of brightnesses and the rise and decline times of observed SNe
Ia. However, their colours and spectra do not match the observations. In
particular, their B-V colours are generally too red. We show that this
discrepancy is mainly due to the composition of the burning products of the He
shell of our models which contain significant amounts of Ti and Cr. Using a toy
model, we also show that the burning products of the He shell depend crucially
on its initial composition. This leads us to conclude that good agreement
between sub-Chandrasekhar-mass explosions and observed SNe Ia may still be
feasible but further study of the shell properties is required.

metric as having positive, zero or negative curvature is expected to be an
important aspect of warped compactifications in supergravity. In this context,
Douglas and Kallosh recently pointed out that a compact internal space with
negative curvature could help to construct four-dimensional de Sitter solutions
only if the extra dimensions are strongly warped or there are large stringy
corrections. That is, the problem of finding 4-dimensional de Sitter solutions
is well posed, if all extra dimensions are physically compact, which is called
a no-go theorem. Here, we show that the above conclusion does not extend to a
general class of warped compactifications in classical supergravity that allow
a non-compact direction or cosmological solutions for which the internal space
is asymptotic to a cone over a product of compact Einstein spaces or spheres.
For clarity, we present classical solutions that compactify higher-dimensional
spacetime to produce a Robertson--Walker universe with de Sitter-type expansion
plus one extra non-compact direction. Such models are found to admit both an
effective four-dimensional Newton constant that remains finite and a
normalizable zero-mode graviton wavefunction. We also exhibit the possibility
of obtaining 4D de Sitter solutions by including the effect of fluxes (p-form

chains. A loop of coupled oscillators is connected to two leads through which
one can either transmit monochromatic waves or white noise signal from heat
baths. We look for the possibility of current magnification in this system due
to some asymmetry introduced between the two arms in the loop. We find that
current magnification is indeed obtained for particular frequency ranges.
However the integrated current shows the effect only in the presence of a
pinning potential for the atoms in the leads. We also study the effect of
anharmonicity on current magnification.

the time-convolutionless (TCL) projection operator technique. Within this
perturbative approach the projection onto the current yields the decay of
autocorrelations to lowest order of {\Delta}. The resulting diffusion constants
scale as 1/{\Delta}^2 in the Markovian regime {\Delta}<<1 (s=1/2) and as
1/{\Delta} in the highly non-Markovian regime above {\Delta} \sim 1 (arbitrary

(contrast) imaging that avoids the pedestal noise and the scheme of second
harmonic detection of photon nonlinearities in vacuum over a long

shown that for any graph $G = (V, E)$ and a subset of $k$ terminals $K \subset
V$, there is a polynomial time algorithm to construct a graph $H = (K, E_H)$ on
just the terminal set so that simultaneously for all cuts $(A, K-A)$, the value
of the minimum cut in $G$ separating $A$ from $K -A$ is approximately the same
as the value of the corresponding cut in $H$.
  We give the first super-constant lower bounds for how well a cut-sparsifier
$H$ can simultaneously approximate all minimum cuts in $G$. We prove a lower
bound of $\Omega(\log^{1/4} k)$ -- this is polynomially-related to the known
upper bound of $O(\log k/\log \log k)$. This is an exponential improvement on
the $\Omega(\log \log k)$ bound given in \cite{LM} which in fact was for a
stronger vertex sparsification guarantee, and did not apply to cut sparsifiers.
  Despite this negative result, we show that for many natural problems, we do
not need to incur a multiplicative penalty for our reduction. We obtain optimal
$O(\log k)$-competitive Steiner oblivious routing schemes, which generalize the
results in \cite{R}. We also demonstrate that for a wide range of graph packing
problems (which includes maximum concurrent flow, maximum multiflow and
multicast routing, among others, as a special case), the integrality gap of the
linear program is always at most $O(\log k)$ times the integrality gap
restricted to trees. This result helps to explain the ubiquity of the $O(\log
k)$ guarantees for such problems.
  Lastly, we use our ideas to give an efficient construction for
vertex-sparsifiers that match the current best existential results -- this was
previously open. Our algorithm makes novel use of Earth-mover constraints.

overlays on top of the Internet to facilitate efficient sharing of resources.
It can be roughly classified as either structured or unstructured networks.
Without stringent constraints over the network topology, unstructured P2P
networks can be constructed very efficiently and are therefore considered
suitable to the Internet environment. However, the random search strategies
adopted by these networks usually perform poorly with a large network size. To
enhance the search performance in unstructured P2P networks through exploiting
users' common interest patterns captured within a probability-theoretic
framework termed the user interest model (UIM). A search protocol and a routing
table updating protocol are further proposed in order to expedite the search
process through self organizing the P2P network into a small world. Both
theoretical and experimental analyses are conducted and demonstrated the
effectiveness and efficiency of the approach.

networks, traffic should be sent via a route that can be avoid nodes with low
energy. In addition, considering that the nodes of ad hoc networks are mobile,
it is possible that a created path is broken because of nodes mobility and
establishment of a new path would be done again. This is because of sending
additional control packets, accordingly, energy consumption increases. Also, it
should avoid nodes which have more buffered packets. Maybe, because of long
queue, some of these packets are dropped and transmitted again. This is the
reason for wasting of energy. In this paper we propose a new energy efficient

detectable RRLs for detailed studies.
  Methods. We searched for the RRLs H91alpha and H92alpha at 8 GHz in the
nearby Seyfert galaxy NGC 4945 using the ATCA with resolution of 3"". This
yielded a detection from which we derived conditions in the starburst.
  Results. We detected RRLs from the nucleus of NGC 4945 with a peak strength
of 17.8 mJy, making it the strongest extragalactic RRL emitter known at this
frequency. The line emission from NGC 4945 can be matched by a model consisting
of a collection of 10 to 300 H II regions with temperatures of 5000 K,
densities of 10^3 cm^-3 to 10^4 cm^-3 and a total effective diameter of 2 pc to
100 pc. The Lyman continuum production rate required to maintain the ionization
requires 2000 to 10000 O5 stars to be produced in the starburst, inferring a
star formation rate of 2 Msun/yr to 8 Msun/yr. We resolved the rotation curve
within the central 70 pc region and this is well described by a set of rotating
rings that were coplanar and edge on with a simple flat rotation curve. The
rotation speed of 120 km/s within the central 1"" (19 pc) radius infers an
enclosed mass of 3 x 10^7 Msun.
  Conclusion. We discovered RRLs from NGC 4945. It is the strongest known
extragalactic RRL emitter and is suited to high-quality spectroscopic study. We
resolved the dynamics of the ionized gas in the central 70 pc and derived
conditions and star formation rates in the ionized gas.

rectifiable curves in $R^n$ as the double integral along the curve of $1/r^q$.
Here $r$ stands for the radius of the (smallest) circle that is tangent to the
curve at one point and passes through another point on the curve, with obvious
natural modifications of this definition in the exceptional, non-generic cases.
It turns out that finiteness of $E_q(\gamma)$ for $q\ge 2$ guarantees that
$\gamma$ has no self-intersections or triple junctions and therefore must be
homeomorphic to the unit circle or to a closed interval. For $q>2$ the energy
$E_q$ evaluated on curves in $R^3$ turns out to be a knot energy separating
different knot types by infinite energy barriers and bounding the number of
knot types below a given energy value. We also establish an explicit upper
bound on the Hausdorff-distance of two curves in $R^3$ with finite $E_q$-energy
that guarantees that these curves are ambient isotopic. This bound depends only
on $q$ and the energy values of the curves. Moreover, for all $q$ that are
larger than the critical exponent $2$, the arclength parametrization of
$\gamma$ is of class $C^{1,1-2/q}$, with H\""{o}lder norm of the unit tangent
depending only on $q$, the length of $\gamma$, and the local energy. The
exponent $1-2/q$ is optimal.

is due to the problem of the keywords which can be very subjective and time

A constraint solver is used to find a configuration that satisfies the goal,

instrumented to allow subsequent autonomic management. If, during execution,
the manager detects that the original goal is no longer being met, the
satisfy/deploy process can be repeated automatically in order to generate a

(nested bars) depends on the angular velocity (i.e. pattern speed) of this bar.
We study orbits in seven models of double bars using the method of invariant
loops. The range of pattern speed is covered exhaustively. We find that not all
pattern speeds are allowed when the inner bar rotates in the same direction as
the outer bar. Below a certain minimum pattern speed orbital support for the
inner bar abruptly disappears, while at high values of this speed the orbits
indicate an increasingly round bar that looks more like a twist in the nuclear
isophotes than a dynamically independent component. For values between these
two extremes, orbits supporting the inner bar extend further out as the bar's
pattern speed decreases, their corresponding loops become more eccentric,
pulsate more, and their rotation becomes increasingly non-uniform, as they
speed up and slow down in their motion. Lower pattern speeds also lead to a
less coherent bar, as the pulsation and acceleration increasingly varies among
the loops supporting the inner bar. The morphologies of fast and slow inner
bars expected from the orbital structure studied here are recently recovered
observationally by decomposition of double barred galaxies. Our findings allow
us to link the observed morphology to the dynamics of the inner bar.

particles that decay to charged particles plus missing energy. Specifically, we
focus on the case of a neutralino NLSP decaying to Z and gravitino within the
context of General Gauge Mediation. We show that a combination of searches
using the inner detector and the muon spectrometer yields a wide range of
potential early LHC discoveries for NLSP lifetimes ranging from 10^(-1)-10^5
mm. We further show that events from Z(l+l-) can be used for detailed kinematic
reconstruction, leading to accurate determinations of the neutralino mass and
lifetime. In particular, we examine the prospects for detailed event study at
ATLAS using the ECAL (making use of its timing and pointing capabilities)
together with the TRT, or using the muon spectrometer alone. Finally, we also
demonstrate that there is a region in parameter space where the Tevatron could
potentially discover new physics in the delayed Z(l+l-)+MET channel. While our
discussion centers on gauge mediation, many of the results apply to any
scenario with a long-lived neutral particle decaying to charged particles.
