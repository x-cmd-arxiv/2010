Aharonov-Bohm oscillations with periods larger than the flux quantum. However,
according to the Byers-Yang theorem, observables of an electronic system are
invariant under an adiabatic insertion of a quantum of singular flux. We
resolve this seeming paradox by considering a microscopic model of electronic
interferometers made from a quantum Hall liquid at filling factor 1/m. An
approximate ground state of such interferometers is described by a Laughlin
type wave function, and low-energy excitations are incompressible deformations
of this state. We construct a low-energy effective theory by restricting the
microscopic Hamiltonian of electrons to the space of incompressible
deformations and show that the theory of the quantum Hall edge so obtained is a
generalization of a chiral conformal field theory. In our theory, a
quasi-particle tunneling operator is found to be a single-valued function of
tunneling point coordinates, and its phase depends on the topology determined
by the positions of Ohmic contacts. We describe strong coupling of the edge
states to Ohmic contacts and the resulting quasi-particle current through the
interferometer with the help of a master equation. We find that the coherent
contribution to the average quasi-particle current through Mach-Zehnder
interferometers does not vanish after summation over quasi-particle degrees of
freedom. However, it acquires oscillations with the electronic period, in
agreement with the Byers-Yang theorem. Importantly, our theory does not rely on
any ad-hoc constructions, such as Klein factors, etc. When the magnetic flux
through an FP interferometer is varied with a modulation gate, current
oscillations have the quasi-particle periodicity, thus allowing for
spectroscopy of quantum Hall edge states.

dynamics reflects the non-equilibrium nature of the species interactions. While
previous work focusses on the coarsening process as a mechanism that drives the
system to extinction, we found that unexpectedly the dynamics to extinction is
much richer. We observed three different types of dynamics. In addition to
coarsening, in the evolutionary relevant limit of large times, oscillating
traveling waves and heteroclinic orbits play a dominant role. The weight of the
different processes depends on the degree of mixing and the system size. By
analytical arguments and extensive numerical simulations we provide the full
characteristics of scenarios leading to extinction in one of the most

differences between the observed fundamental properties of low-mass stars and
those predicted by stellar structure models. Particularly, radius and effective
temperatures computed from models are ~ 5-10% lower and ~ 3-5% higher than
observed, respectively. These discrepancies have been attributed to different
factors, notably to the high levels of magnetic activity present on these
stars. In this paper, we test the effect of magnetic activity both on models
and on the observational analysis of eclipsing binaries using a sample of such
systems with accurate fundamental properties. Regarding stellar models, we have
found that unrealistically high spot coverages need to be assumed to reproduce
the observations. Tests considering metallicity effects and missing opacities
on models indicate that these are not able to explain the radius discrepancies
observed. With respect to the observations, we have tested the effect of
several spot distributions on the light curve analysis. Our results show that
spots cause systematic deviations on the stellar radii derived from light curve
analysis when distributed mainly over the stellar poles. Assuming the existence
of polar spots, overall agreement between models and observations is reached
when ~ 35% spot coverage is considered on stellar models. Such spot coverage
induces a systematic deviation in the radius determination from the light curve
analysis of ~ 3% and is also compatible with the modulations observed on the
light curves of these systems. Finally, we have found that the effect of
activity or rotation on convective transport in partially radiative stars may
also contribute to explain the differences seen in some of the systems with
shorter orbital periods.

For some particle-hole conjugate states of the fractional regime, e.g., with
filling between 1/2 and 1 of the lowest Landau level; early predictions
suggested the presence of counter-propagating edge currents in addition to the
expected ones. When this did not agree with the measured conductance, it was
suggested that disorder and interactions will lead to counterpropagating modes
that carry only energy - the so called neutral modes. In addition, a neutral
upstream mode (Majorana mode) was also expected for selected wavefunctions
proposed for the even denominator filling 5/2. Here we report on the direct
observation of counter-propagating neutral modes in fillings 2/3, 3/5 and 5/2.
This was done by injecting such modes and allowing them to impinge on a narrow
constriction, which partly reflected them, with two main observed effects: (a)
A resultant shot noise proportional to the applied voltage on the injecting
contact; (b) With simultaneously injecting also a charge mode, the presence of
the neutral mode was found to significantly affect the Fano factor and the
temperature of the backscattered charge mode. In particular, such observation
for filling 5/2, may single out the non-abelian wavefunctions for the state.

which is used for these purposes assumes a ""breakdown"" of relativistic
symmetries, meaning that it is a preferred-frame scenario which does not
satisfy the Relativity Principle. The alternative hypothesis of a ""deformation""
of relativistic symmetries, which preserves the Relativity Principle by
adopting deformed laws of relativistic transformation between observers, could
not so far be tested in gamma-ray-burst observations because it was not known
how to formulate it in expanding spacetimes. We here provide such a
formulation, and we find that also for the symmetry-deformation scenario the
analysis of gamma-ray-burst data take us very close to the desired

orbifold of N=4 SYM, which corresponds to \check g=g, and N=2 superconformal
QCD, which is obtained for \check g -> 0. The planar one-loop dilation operator
takes the form of a nearest-neighbor spin-chain Hamiltonian. For superconformal
QCD the spin chain is of novel form: besides the color-adjoint fields
\phi^a_{b}, which occupy individual sites of the chain, there are ""dimers""
Q^a_{i} \bar Q^i_{b} of flavor-contracted fundamental fields, which occupy two

we check the Yang-Baxter equation for the two-magnon S-matrix. It holds as
expected at the orbifold point \check g = g. While violated for general \check

atmospheres and stellar winds from main sequence M stars, with the purpose of
obtaining a quick test-model that estimates the timescale for total atmospheric
mass loss due to this interaction. Planets in the habitable zone of M dwarfs
may be tidally locked and may have weak magnetic fields, because of this we
consider the extreme case of planets with no magnetic field. The model gives
the planetary atmosphere mass loss rate as a function of the stellar wind and
planetary properties (mass, atmospheric pressure and orbital distance) and an
entrainment efficiency coefficient $\alpha$. We use a mixing layer model to
explore two different cases: a time-independent stellar mass loss and a stellar
mass loss rate that decreases with time. For both cases we consider planetary
masses within the range of $1\to10$ M$_{\oplus}$ and atmospheric pressures with
values of 1, 5 and 10 atm. For the time dependent case, planets without
magnetic field in the habitable zone of M dwarfs with initial stellar mass
losses of $\leq \dot{M}_{w} < 10^{-11}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, may retain their
atmospheres for at least 1 Gyr. This case may be applied to early spectral type
M dwarfs (earlier than M5). Studies have shown that late type M dwarfs (later
than M5) may be active for long periods of time ($\geq 4$Gyr), and because of
that our model with constant stellar mass loss rate may be more accurate. For
these stars most planets may have lost their atmospheres in 1 Gyr or less
because most of the late type M dwarfs are expected to be active. We emphasize
that our model only considers planets without magnetic fields. Clearly we must
expect a higher resistance to atmospheric erosion if we include the presence of
a magnetic field.

abundance in our galaxy makes them likely targets in the hunt for habitable
planets, but their strong chromospheric activity produces high energy radiation
and charged particles that may be detrimental to life. We studied the impact of
the 1985 April 12 flare from the M dwarf, AD Leonis (AD Leo), simulating the
effects from both UV radiation and protons on the atmospheric chemistry of a
hypothetical, Earth-like planet located within its habitable zone. Based on
observations of solar proton events and the Neupert effect we estimated a
proton flux associated with the flare of $5.9\times 10^{8}$ protons cm$^{-2}$
sr$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$ for particles with energies >10 MeV. Then we calculated the
abundance of nitrogen oxides produced by the flare by scaling the production of
these compounds during a large solar proton event called the ""Carrington
event"". The simulations were performed using a 1-D photochemical model coupled
to a 1-D radiative/convective model. Our results indicate that the ultraviolet
radiation emitted during the flare does not produce a significant change in the
ozone column depth of the planet. When the action of protons is included, the
ozone depletion reached a maximum of 94% two years after the flare for a planet
with no magnetic field. At the peak of the flare, the calculated UV fluxes that
reach the surface, in the wavelength ranges that are damaging for life, exceed
those received on Earth during less than 100 s. Flares may therefore not
present a direct hazard for life on the surface of an orbiting habitable
planet. Given that AD Leo is one of the most magnetically-active M dwarfs
known, this conclusion should apply to planets around other M dwarfs with lower
levels of chromospheric activity.

physiological, biochemical or other constraints within the cells. In biofilm we
see that the slower waker has a defensive advantage over the fast waker due to
a larger amount of dormant biomass, without an appreciable difference in total

be unrepresentative of the natural state. We discuss the computational methods

dark matter annihilation instead of nuclear fusion. The initial amount of dark
matter gathered by the star gravitationally can sustain it only for a limited
period of time. It has been suggested that capture of additional dark matter
from the environment can prolong the dark star phase even to the present day.
Here we show that this capture process is ineffective to prolong the life of
the first generation of dark stars. We construct a Monte-Carlo simulation that
follows each Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) in the dark matter halo
as its orbit responds to the formation and evolution of the dark star, as it
scatters off the star's nuclei, and as it annihilates inside the star. A rapid
depletion of the WIMPs on orbits that cross the star causes the demise of the
first generation of dark stars. We suggest that a second generation of dark
stars may in principle survive much longer through capture. We comment on the
effect of relaxing our assumptions.

The states in the class are maximally entangled in the sense that their average

known to be highly variable. Our long, uninterrupted optical observation of the
NGC2264 region with CoRoT allows the optical variability in CTTS to be studied
with unprecedented accuracy and time coverage. Two short Chandra observations
obtained during the CoRoT pointing with a separation of 16 days allow us to
study whether there is a correlation between optical and X-ray variability on
this timescale, thus probing the physical mechanisms driving the variability in
both bands. We have computed the optical and X-ray fractional variability
between the two 30 ks duration windows covered by both the Chandra and CoRoT
observations, for a sample of classical and weak line T Tauri stars (WTTSs) in
NGC2264. A scatter plot clearly shows that the variability of CTTSs in the
optical and soft X-ray (0.5-1.5 keV) bands is correlated, while no correlation
is apparent in the hard (1.5-8.0 keV) band. Also, no correlation in either band
is present for WTTSs. We show that the correlation between soft X-ray and
optical variability of CTTSs can be naturally explained in terms of
time-variable shading (absorption) from circumstellar material orbiting the
star, in a scenario rather similar to the one invoked to explain the observed
phenomenology in the CTTS AA Tau. The slope of the observed correlation implies
(in the hypothesis of homogeneous shading) a significant dust depletion in the
circumstellar material (with a gas-to-dust ratio approximately 5 times lower
than the standard value for interstellar material).

entropy of an arbitrary spatial region in an arbitrary holographic field
theory. The von Neumann entropy is a special case of a more general class of
entropies called Renyi entropies. Using Euclidean gravity, Fursaev computed the
entanglement Renyi entropies (EREs) of an arbitrary spatial region in an
arbitrary holographic field theory, and thereby derived the RT formula. We
point out, however, that his EREs are incorrect, since his putative saddle
points do not in fact solve the Einstein equation. We remedy this situation in
the case of two-dimensional CFTs, considering regions consisting of one or two
intervals. For a single interval, the EREs are known for a general CFT; we
reproduce them using gravity. For two intervals, the RT formula predicts a
phase transition in the entanglement entropy as a function of their separation,
and that the mutual information between the intervals vanishes for separations
larger than the phase transition point. By computing EREs using gravity and CFT
techniques, we find evidence supporting both predictions. We also find evidence
that large-$N$ symmetric-product theories have the same EREs as holographic
ones.

the random measurements and the measurement matrix. Traditional sparse signal
recovery methods have seriously degeneration with the measurement matrix
uncertainty (MMU). Here the MMU is modeled as a bounded additive error. An
anti-uncertainty constraint in the form of a mixed L2 and L1 norm is deduced
from the sparse signal model with MMU. Then we combine the sparse constraint
with the anti-uncertainty constraint to get an anti-uncertainty sparse signal
recovery operator. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed operator
has a better reconstructing performance with the MMU than traditional methods.

summarizes the recent progress in observational and theoretical work on the

motion of the central compact radio source, Sgr A*, that this radio source must
be a massive black hole of about 4.4 \times 1e6 Msun, beyond any reasonable
doubt. We report what is known about the structure and evolution of the dense

that stars have been forming in the vicinity of Sgr A* recently, apparently

fainter stars centered in the immediate vicinity of the massive black hole,

includes a central point mass M and a local dark energy density \rho_{loc}) and
discuss the position of the zero-gravity distance R_v in the Hubble diagram.
Our main conclusions are: 1) When the local DE density \rho_{loc} is equal to
the global DE density \rho_v, the outflow reaches the global Hubble rate at the
distance R_2 = (1+z_v)R_v, where z_v is the global zero-acceleration redshift
(\approx 0.7 for the standard model). This is also the radius of the ideal
Einstein-Straus vacuole. 2) For a wide range of the local-to-global dark energy
ratio \rho_{loc}/\rho_v, the local flow reaches the known global rate (the
Hubble constant) at a distance R_2 \ga 1.5 \times R_v. Hence, R_v will be
between R_2/2 and R_2, giving upper and lower limits to \rho_{loc}/M. For the
Local Group, this supports the view that the local density is near the global
one.

the classical Vlasov-Poisson system, but is coupled to a potential in $-1/r-
1/r^2$ (Manev potential) instead of the usual gravitational potential in
$-1/r$, and in particular the potential field does not satisfy a Poisson
equation but a fractional-Laplacian equation. We first prove the orbital
stability of the ground states type solutions which are constructed as
minimizers of the Hamiltonian, following the classical strategy: compactness of
the minimizing sequences and the rigidity of the flow. However, in driving this
analysis, there are two mathematical obstacles: the first one is related to the
possible blow-up of solutions to the VM system, which we overcome by imposing a
sub-critical condition on the constraints of the variational problem. The
second difficulty (and the most important) is related to the nature of the
Euler-Lagrange equations (fractional-Laplacian equations) to which classical
results for the Poisson equation do not extend. We overcome this difficulty by
proving the uniqueness of the minimizer under equimeasurabilty constraints,
using only the regularity of the potential and not the fractional-Laplacian
Euler-Lagrange equations itself. In the second part of this work, we prove the
existence of exact self-similar blow-up solutions to the Vlasov-Manev equation,
with initial data arbitrarily close to ground states. This construction is

main description for micro-organisms and have also been useful to understand
the foraging behaviour of large animals. Nevertheless, most vertebrates, in
particular humans and other primates, rely on sophisticated cognitive tools
such as spatial maps, episodic memory and travel cost discounting. These
properties call for other modeling approaches of mobility patterns. We propose
a foraging framework where a learning mobile agent uses a combination of
memory-based and random steps. We investigate how advantageous it is to use
memory for exploiting resources in heterogeneous and changing environments. An
adequate balance of determinism and random exploration is found to maximize the
foraging efficiency and to generate trajectories with an intricate
spatio-temporal order. Based on this approach, we propose some tools for
analysing the non-random nature of mobility patterns in general.

Observations clearly indicate a 100-micrometer thermal lightcurve with an
amplitude of a factor of ~ 2, which is positively correlated with the optical
lightcurve. This confirms that both are primarily due to shape effects. A
160-micrometer lightcurve is marginally detected. Radiometric fits of the mean
Herschel- and Spitzer- fluxes indicate an equivalent diameter D ~ 1300 km and a
geometric albedo p_v ~ 0.70-0.75. These values agree with inferences from the
optical lightcurve, supporting the hydrostatic equilibrium hypothesis. The
large amplitude of the 100-micrometer lightcurve suggests that the object has a
high projected a/b axis ratio (~ 1.3) and a low thermal inertia as well as
possible variable infrared beaming. This may point to fine regolith on the

Quantum Einstein Gravity necessitates that the underlying effective average
action depends on two metrics, a dynamical metric giving the vacuum expectation
value of the quantum field, and a background metric supplying the coarse
graining scale. The central requirement of ""background independence"" is met by
leaving the background metric completely arbitrary. This bimetric structure
entails that the effective average action may contain three classes of
interactions: those built from the dynamical metric only, terms which are
purely background, and those involving a mixture of both metrics. This work
initiates the first study of the full-fledged gravitational RG flow, which
explicitly accounts for this bimetric structure, by considering an ansatz for
the effective average action which includes all three classes of interactions.
It is shown that the non-trivial gravitational RG fixed point central to the
Asymptotic Safety program persists upon disentangling the dynamical and
background terms. Moreover, upon including the mixed terms, a second
non-trivial fixed point emerges, which may control the theory's IR behavior.

stellar disks, of supernova feedback, of the transition between central and
satellite status as galaxies fall into larger systems, and of gas and star
stripping once they become satellites. Plausible values of efficiency and
scaling parameters yield an excellent fit not only to the observed abundance of
low-redshift galaxies over 5 orders of magnitude in stellar mass and 9
magnitudes in luminosity, but also to the observed abundance of Milky Way
satellites. This suggests that reionisation effects may not be needed to solve
the ""missing satellite"" problem except, perhaps, for the faintest objects. The
same model matches the observed large-scale clustering of galaxies as a
function of stellar mass and colour. The fit remains excellent down to ~30kpc
for massive galaxies. For M* < 6 x 10^10Msun, however, the model overpredicts
clustering at scales below 1 Mpc, suggesting that the sigma_8 adopted in the

between the simulations and match those observed, but only if galaxies without
dark matter subhalos (so-called orphans) are included. Our model predicts a
larger passive fraction among low-mass galaxies than is observed, as well as an

For an arbitrary space $X$, we compute the topological fundamental group of the

host morphology. While spiral galaxies almost exclusively host radio-quiet
QSOs, ellipticals can host either radio-louds or radio-quiets. We find that a
combination of accretion rate and host scale determines which type of QSO a
given elliptical galaxy will host. QSOs with high x-ray luminosities (above
10^44.5 erg/s at 0.5 keV) are mostly radio-loud. But those with low
luminosities divide fairly neatly in size (measured by the half-light radius,
r_e). Those larger than about 10 kpc are radio-loud, while smaller ones are
radio-quiet. It has recently been found that core and coreless ellipticals are
also divided near this limit. This implies that for low-luminosity QSOs,
radio-louds are found in core ellipticals, while radio-quiets are in coreless
ellipticals and spirals. This segregation also shows up strongly for
low-redshift objects, and in general, there is a loss over time of coreless,
radio-loud QSOs. Since the presence or absence of a core may be tied to the
galactic merger history, we have an evolutionary explanation for the

allowing the generation of cross-correlated stationary noise time series was
set-up. Multi-channel time series with the desired cross correlation behavior
can be generated once a model for a multichannel cross-spectral matrix is
provided. The core of the procedure is the synthesis of a noise coloring
multichannel filter through a frequency-by-frequency eigendecomposition of the
model cross-spectral matrix and a Z-domain fit. The common problem of initial
transients in noise time series is solved with a proper initialization of the
filter recursive equations. The noise generator performances were tested in a
two dimensional case study of the LTP dynamics along the two principal channels
of the sensing interferometer.

study of the dynamics of accretion disks in the Athena magnetohydrodynamics
(MHD) code. Second-order Crank-Nicholson time differencing is used for the
Coriolis and tidal gravity source terms that appear in the momentum equation
for accuracy and stability. We show this approach conserves energy for
epicyclic oscillations in hydrodynamic flows to round-off error. In the energy
equation, the tidal gravity source terms are differenced as the gradient of an
effective potential in a way which guarantees that total energy (including the
gravitational potential energy) is also conserved to round-off error. We
introduce an orbital advection algorithm for MHD based on constrained transport
to preserve the divergence-free constraint on the magnetic field. This
algorithm removes the orbital velocity from the time step constraint, and makes
the truncation error more uniform in radial position. Modifications to the
shearing box boundary conditions applied at the radial boundaries are necessary
to conserve the total vertical magnetic flux. In principle similar corrections
are also required to conserve mass, momentum and energy, however in practice we
find the orbital advection method conserves these quantities to better than
0.03% over hundreds of orbits. The algorithms have been applied to studies of
the nonlinear regime of the MRI in very wide (up to 32 scale heights)
horizontal domains.

observed in 195 \AA\ images obtained using the Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging
Telescope (EIT) onboard the \emph{Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)}.
Commonly called ``EIT waves"", CBFs typically appear as diffuse fronts that
propagate pseudo-radially across the solar disk at velocities of 100--700 km
s$^{-1}$ with front widths of 50-100 Mm. As their speed is greater than the
quiet coronal sound speed ($c_s\leq$200 km s$^{-1}$) and comparable to the
local Alfv\'{e}n speed ($v_A\leq$1000 km s$^{-1}$), they were initially
interpreted as fast-mode magnetoacoustic waves ($v_{f}=(c_s^2 + v_A^2)^{1/2}$).
Their propagation is now known to be modified by regions where the magnetosonic
sound speed varies, such as active regions and coronal holes, but there is also
evidence for stationary CBFs at coronal hole boundaries. The latter has led to
the suggestion that they may be a manifestation of a processes such as Joule
heating or magnetic reconnection, rather than a wave-related phenomena. While
the general morphological and kinematic properties of CBFs and their
association with coronal mass ejections have now been well described, there are
many questions regarding their excitation and propagation. In particular, the
theoretical interpretation of these enigmatic events as magnetohydrodynamic
waves or due to changes in magnetic topology remains the topic of much debate.

less than 2.5 were selected as quasar targets in SDSS. Except one source
without near-IR $Y$-band data, seven of these eight new quasars meet a newly
proposed quasar selection criterion involving both near-IR and optical colors.
Two of them were found in the 'redshift desert' for quasars ($z$ from 2.2 to
3), indicating that the new criterion is efficient for recovering the missing
quasars with similar optical colors as stars. Although LAMOST met some problems
during the commissioning observations, we were still able to identify other 38

generation and strong variations of power consumption and generation levels. In
the presence of uncertainty the statistical description of the system is
required to assess the risks of power outages. In order to find the probability
of exceeding the constraints for voltage levels we introduce the probability
distribution of maximal voltage drop and propose an algorithm for finding this
distribution. The algorithm is based on the assumption of random but
statistically independent distribution of loads on buses. Linear complexity in
the number of buses is achieved through the dynamic programming technique. We
illustrate the performance of the algorithm by analyzing a simple 4-bus system
with high variations of load levels.

electrical distribution circuit may severely degrade power quality due to
voltage sags and swells caused by rapidly varying PV generation during cloud
transients coupled with the slow response of existing utility compensation and
regulation equipment. Although not permitted under current standards for
interconnection of distributed generation, fast-reacting, VAR-capable PV
inverters may provide the necessary reactive power injection or consumption to
maintain voltage regulation under difficult transient conditions. As side
benefit, the control of reactive power injection at each PV inverter provides
an opportunity and a new tool for distribution utilities to optimize the
performance of distribution circuits, e.g. by minimizing thermal losses. We
suggest a local control scheme that dispatches reactive power from each PV
inverter based on local instantaneous measurements of the real and reactive
components of the consumed power and the real power generated by the PVs. Using
one adjustable parameter per circuit, we balance the requirements on power
quality and desire to minimize thermal losses. Numerical analysis of two
exemplary systems, with comparable total PV generation albeit a different
spatial distribution, show how to adjust the optimization parameter depending
on the goal. Overall, this local scheme shows excellent performance; it's
capable of guaranteeing acceptable power quality and achieving significant
saving in thermal losses in various situations even when the renewable
generation in excess of the circuit own load, i.e. feeding power back to the
higher-level system.

problems with the existing deconvolution techniques, and may be used to suggest
more reliable computational approaches and methodology.

types of atoms $\Atoms = \{\At_1,\ldots ,\At_{|{\Atoms}|}\}$. We address the
random generation of such structures with respect to a size $n$ and a targeted
distribution in $k$ of its \emph{distinguished} atoms. We consider two
variations on this problem. In the first alternative, the targeted distribution
is given by $k$ real numbers $\TargFreq_1, \ldots, \TargFreq_k$ such that $0 <
\TargFreq_i < 1$ for all $i$ and $\TargFreq_1+\cdots+\TargFreq_k \leq 1$. We
aim to generate random structures among the whole set of structures of a given
size $n$, in such a way that the {\em expected} frequency of any distinguished
atom $\At_i$ equals $\TargFreq_i$. We address this problem by weighting the
atoms with a $k$-tuple $\Weights$ of real-valued weights, inducing a weighted
distribution over the set of structures of size $n$. We first adapt the
classical recursive random generation scheme into an algorithm taking
$\bigO{n^{1+o(1)}+mn\log{n}}$ arithmetic operations to draw $m$ structures from
the $\Weights$-weighted distribution. Secondly, we address the analytical
computation of weights such that the targeted frequencies are achieved
asymptotically, i. e. for large values of $n$. We derive systems of functional
equations whose resolution gives an explicit relationship between $\Weights$
and $\TargFreq_1, \ldots, \TargFreq_k$. Lastly, we give an algorithm in
$\bigO{k n^4}$ for the inverse problem, {\it i.e.} computing the frequencies
associated with a given $k$-tuple $\Weights$ of weights, and an optimized
version in $\bigO{k n^2}$ in the case of context-free languages. This allows
for a heuristic resolution of the weights/frequencies relationship suitable for
complex specifications. In the second alternative, the targeted distribution is
given by a $k$ natural numbers $n_1, \ldots, n_k$ such that
$n_1+\cdots+n_k+r=n$ where $r \geq 0$ is the number of undistinguished atoms.
The structures must be generated uniformly among the set of structures of size
$n$ that contain {\em exactly} $n_i$ atoms $\At_i$ ($1 \leq i \leq k$). We give
a $\bigO{r^2\prod_{i=1}^k n_i^2 +m n k \log n}$ algorithm for generating $m$
structures, which simplifies into a $\bigO{r\prod_{i=1}^k n_i +m n}$ for
regular specifications.

noninteracting canonical equilibrium at temperature T in the electron as well
as in the phonon subsystems, leads to a rather simple dynamics. A richer time
evolution emerges if the initial state is taken as the product of the phonon
vacuum and the filled Fermi sea supplemented by a highly excited additional
electron. Our model has a natural set of constants of motion, with as many
elements as degrees of freedom. In accordance with earlier studies of such type
of models we find that expectation values which become stationary can be
described by the density matrix of a generalized Gibbs ensemble which differs
from that of a canonical ensemble. For the model at hand it appears to be
evident that the eigenmode occupancy operators should be used in the
