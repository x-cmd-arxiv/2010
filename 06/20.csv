number of mid- to far-IR intra-galactic photons reradiated by dust. Photons in

Observatory SN Search, and we discuss corresponding implications for massive
star evolution. For a standard IMF, observed fractions of SN types cannot be
reconciled with expectations of single-star evolution. The mass range of WR
stars that shed their H envelopes via their own mass loss accounts for less
than half the observed fraction of SNeIbc. Progenitors of SNeIbc must extend to
a much lower range of initial masses than classical WR stars, and we argue that
most SNIbc and SNIIb progenitors must arise from binary Roche-lobe overflow.
SNeIc still trace higher mass and metallicity, because line-driven winds in the
WR stage remove the He layer and propel the transition from SNIb to Ic. Less
massive progenitors of SNeIb and IIb may not be classical WR stars; they may be
underluminous with weak winds, possibly hidden by overluminous mass-gainer
companions that appear as B[e] supergiants or related objects having aspherical
circumstellar material. The remaining SN types (II-P, II-L, and IIn) are
redistributed across the full range of initial mass. We consider direct
collapse to black holes without visible SNe, but find this problematic. Major
areas of remaining uncertainty are (1) the influence of binary separation,
rotation, and metallicity, (2) mass differences in progenitors of SNeIIn
compared to SNeII-L and II-P, and (3) SNeIc arising from single stars with

observations in sparsely populated regions. We show that heavy-tailed
stochastic processes (which we construct from Gaussian processes via a copula),
can be used to improve robustness of regression and classification estimators
to such outliers by selectively shrinking them more strongly in sparse regions
than in dense regions. We carry out a theoretical analysis to show that

biological data which indicate significant improvements of estimates in sparse

supermassive black holes, are an important potential source for gravitational
wave detectors. Because of the extreme mass-ratio, one can model these systems
using perturbation theory. However, in order to relate the motion of the small
body to the emitted waveform, one requires a model that is accurate on
extremely long timescales. Additionally, in order to avoid intractable
divergences, one requires a model that treats the small body as asymptotically
small rather than exactly pointlike. Both of these difficulties can be resolved
by using techniques of singular perturbation theory. I begin this dissertation
with an analysis of singular perturbation theory on manifolds, including the
common techniques of matched asymptotic expansions and two-timescale
expansions. I then formulate a systematic asymptotic expansion in which the
metric perturbation due to the body is expanded while a representative
worldline is held fixed, and I contrast it with a regular expansion in which
both the metric and the worldline must be expanded. This results in an
approximation that is potentially uniformly accurate on long timescales. The
equation of motion for the body's fixed worldline is determined by performing a
local-in-space expansion in the neighbourhood of the body. Using this local
expansion as boundary data, I construct a global solution to the perturbative
Einstein equation. To concretely characterize orbits, I next devise a
relativistic generalization of the Newtonian method of osculating orbits.
Making use of this method and two-timescale expansions, I examine the utility
of adiabatic approximations that can forgo an explicit calculation of the
force.

morphological and asymmetry studies performed in sample of 92 galaxies found in

Pairs of Galaxies (KPGs), and Isolated Galaxies (KIGs). Both studies have
proved useful for identifying the effect of interactions on galaxies. In the
NIR, the properties of the galaxies in HCGs, KPGs, and KIGs are more similar
than they are in the optical. This is because the NIR band traces the older
stellar populations, which formed earlier and are more relaxed than the younger
populations. However, we found asymmetries related to interactions in both KPG
and HCG samples. In HCGs, the fraction of asymmetric galaxies is even higher
than what we found in the optical. In the KPGs the interactions look like very
recent events, while in the HCGs galaxies are more morphologically evolved and
show properties suggesting they suffered more frequent interactions. The key
difference seems to be the absence of star formation in the HCGs; while
interactions produce intense star formation in the KPGs, we do not see this
effect in the HCGs. This is consistent with the dry merger hypothesis (Coziol &
Plauchu-Frayn 2007); the interaction between galaxies in compact groups, (CGs),
is happening without the presence of gas. If the gas was spent in stellar
formation (to build the bulge of the numerous early-type galaxies), then the
HCGs possibly started interacting sometime before the KPGs. On the other hand,
the dry interaction condition in CGs suggests that the galaxies are on merging
orbits, and consequently such system cannot be that much older either.

The presence of two edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles provides an advantage when
implementing two algorithms that require a ring structure by allowing message
traffic to be spread evenly across the twisted cube. Furthermore, we construct
two equal node-disjoint cycles in $TQ_n$ for any odd integer $n\geqslant 3$, in
which these two cycles contain the same number of nodes and every node appears
in one cycle exactly once. In other words, we decompose a twisted cube into two
components with the same size such that each component contains a Hamiltonian
cycle.

cores begin to interact, reconnection develops in the vacuum that forms between
the pair. Out of the reconnection region, vortex waves are emitted with
properties similar to waves in the local induction approximation. These waves
propagate down the initial vortex and deepen. When they deepen far enough,
secondary reconnections occur and vortex rings form. Near this time, spectra
have a $k^{-3}$ regime. As the vortex rings fully separate, the high wavenumber
spectra grow until, at the final time simulated, spectra in two directions
develop nearly -5/3 subranges. This occurs without the dissipation of energy.

is generalized Bose-Einstein condensation in the eigenstates of the single
particle Hamiltonian, there is also generalized condensation in the kinetic
energy states. In these cases Bose-Einstein condensation is produced or
enhanced by the external potential. In the present paper we establish a
criterion for the absence of condensation in single kinetic energy states and
prove that this criterion is satisfied for a class of random potentials and
weak potentials. This means that the condensate is spread over an infinite
number of states with low kinetic energy without any of them being
macroscopically occupied.

geometric term which contributes null curvature tensor, and a physical term

Particularly: 1) at least for a weak field, $g^{ij}\Gamma^\rho_{ij}=0$ fixes
the gauge completely and picks out exactly the two physical components of the
gravitational field; 2) like $A^0$, the non-dynamical components $h_{0\mu}$ are
solved instantaneously; 3) gravitational radiation is generated by the
""transverse"" part of the energy-momentum tensor, similar to the transverse
current $\vec J_\perp$. This true"" radiation gauge $g^{ij}\Gamma^\rho_{ij}=0$
is especially pertinent for studying gravitational energy, such as the energy
flow in gravitational radiation. It agrees with the transverse-traceless (TT)
gauge for a pure wave, and reveals remarkably how the TT gauge can be adapted
