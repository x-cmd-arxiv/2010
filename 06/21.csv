processing is an efficient quantum error-correcting code (QECC) that robustly
protects the involved fragile quantum states from their environment. Just as
classical error-correcting codes are indispensible in today's information
technologies, it is believed that QECC will play a similarly crucial role in
tomorrow's quantum information systems. Here, we report on the first
experimental demonstration of a quantum erasure-correcting code that overcomes
the devastating effect of photon losses. Whereas {\it errors} translate, in an
information theoretic language, the noise affecting a transmission line, {\it
erasures} correspond to the in-line probabilistic loss of photons. Our quantum
code protects a four-mode entangled mesoscopic state of light against erasures,
and its associated encoding and decoding operations only require linear optics
and Gaussian resources. Since in-line attenuation is generally the strongest
limitation to quantum communication, much more than noise, such an
erasure-correcting code provides a new tool for establishing quantum optical
coherence over longer distances. We investigate two approaches for
circumventing in-line losses using this code, and demonstrate that both
approaches exhibit transmission fidelities beyond what is possible by classical
means.

dynamically a large cosmological constant (CC), whatever it be its starting
value in the early universe. Hence, it is possible to understand, without
fine-tuning, the very small current value of the CC as compared to its
theoretically expected large value in quantum field theory and string theory.
In our framework, this relaxation appears as a pure gravitational effect, where
no ad hoc scalar fields are needed. The action involves a positive power of a
characteristic mass parameter, M, whose value can be, interestingly enough, of
the order of a typical particle physics mass of the Standard Model of the
strong and electroweak interactions or extensions thereof, including the
neutrino mass. The model universe emerging from this scenario (the ""Relaxed

object, not a field), which in this case is generated by the effective
functional and is responsible for the dynamical adjustment of the cosmological
constant. This model universe successfully mimics the essential past epochs of
the standard (or ""concordance"") cosmological model (LCDM). Furthermore, it
provides interesting clues to the coincidence problem and it may even connect

definite initial directions of propagation relative to the z-axis. This
approach results in a significant compensation of the beam wandering which in
many cases is the main contributor to the SI. A novel method is to generate the
PCBs by combining two laser beams - Gaussian and vortex beams, with different
frequencies (the difference between these two frequencies being significantly
smaller than the frequencies themselves). In this case, the effective
suppression of the SI does not require high-frequency modulators. This result

ability to create themselves through the use of cell division and cell

biological cell division. The model consists of a positive ionic gradient
across the cell membrane, and concentration of charge at the nodes of the
spindle and on the chromosomes. A simple calculation, based on Coulomb's Law,
shows that under such circumstances a chromosome will tend to break up to its
constituent chromatids and that the chromatids will be separated by a distance
that is an order of thirty percent of the distance between the spindle nodes.
Further repulsion between the nodes will tend to stretch the cell and
eventually break the cell membrane between the separated chromatids, leading to
cell division. The importance of this work is in continuing the understanding
of the electromagnetic basis of cell division and providing it with an

previously published algorithms in many aspects, most significantly in how they
represent the integrand, how they treat non-numerical values of the integrand,
how they deal with improper divergent integrals and how they estimate the
integration error. The main focus of these improvements is to increase the
reliability of the algorithms without significantly impacting their efficiency.
Both algorithms are implemented in Matlab and tested using both the ""families""
suggested by Lyness and Kaganove and the battery test used by Gander and
Gautschi and Kahaner. They are shown to be more reliable, albeit in some cases
less efficient, than other commonly-used adaptive integrators.

considered from another viewpoint. The quark mass is assumed to have a

The potential for the new field background is evaluated up to two loops.
Expressing the running coupling in terms of the scale parameter $\mu$, the
potential minimum is chosen to fix $m_{top}=175$ $GeV$ when $\mu_0=498 $ $MeV$.
The second derivative of the potential predicts a scalar field mass of 126.76
$GeV$. This number is close to the value 114 $GeV$ which, preliminary data
taken at CERN, suggested to be associated with the Higgs particle. However, the
simplifying assumptions limit the validity of the calculations done, as
indicated by the large value of $\alpha=\frac {g^2}{4\pi}=1.077 $ obtained.
However, supporting statements about the possibility of improving the scheme
come from the necessary inclusion of weak and scalar field couplings and mass
counterterms in the renormalization procedure, in common with the seemingly
needed consideration of the massive W and Z fields, if the real conditions of
the SM model are intended to be approached.

were accepted program stars) were carried out with the 2.3m telescope at the
Siding Spring Observatory (SSO). Corrections for the survey volume covered by
the sample stars were quantitatively estimated and applied to the observed MDF.
The corrections are quite small, when compared with those for a previously
studied sample of metal-poor giants. The corrected observational MDF of the
turnoff sample was then compared with that of the giants, as well as with a
number of theoretical predictions of Galactic chemical evolution, including the
mass-loss modified Simple Model. Although the survey-volume corrected MDFs of
the metal-poor turnoff and the halo giants notably differ in the region of
[Fe/H] > -2.0, below [Fe/H] ~ -2.0, (the region we scientifically focus on
most) both MDFs show a sharp drop at [Fe/H] ~ -3.6 and present rather similar
distributions in the low-metallicity tail. Theoretical models can fit some
parts of the observed MDF, but none is found to simultaneously reproduce the
peak as well as the features in the metal-poor region with [Fe/H] between -2.0
to -3.6. Among the tested models only the GAMETE model, when normalized to the
tail of the observed MDF below [Fe/H] ~ -3.0, and with Z_{cr} =
10^{-3.4}Z_{\odot}, is able to predict the sharp drop at [Fe/H] ~ -3.6.

determining the equilibrium structure of crystalline materials. Deviations from
perfect periodicity, for example due to thermal motion of the atoms, reduces
the intensity of the Bragg peaks as well as produces structure in the diffuse
scattering background. Analysis of the thermal diffuse scattering (TDS) had
been used to determine interatomic force constants and phonon dispersion in
relatively simple cases before inelastic neutron scattering became the
preferred technique to study lattice dynamics. With the advent of intense
synchrotron x-ray sources, there was a renewed interest in TDS for measuring
phonon dispersion. The relatively short x-ray pulses emanating from these
sources also enables the measurement of phonon dynamics in the time domain.
Prior experiments on nonequilibrium phonons were either limited by
time-resolution and/or to relatively long wavelength excitations. Here we
present the first images of nonequilibrium phonons throughout the Brillouin
zone in photoexcited III-V semiconductors, indium-phosphide and
indium-antimonide, using picosecond time-resolved diffuse scattering. In each
case, we find that the lattice remain out of equilibrium for several hundred
picoseconds up to nanoseconds after laser excitation. The non-equilibrium
population is dominated by transverse acoustic phonons which in InP are
directed along high-symmetry directions. The results have wide implications for
the detailed study of electron-phonon and phonon-phonon coupling in solids.

of short-period comets far from perihelion. The method utilizes the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey Catalog (Data Release 7) as a homogeneous source of
reference star magnitudes. Results are based on SDSS-r' filtered images taken
using 2.0-m aperture telescopes for which the exposure time was adjusted to
achieve a constant motion-blur of 2.0 pixels (0.56 arcsec) on the CCD chip.
Aperture photometry using circular and tilted elliptical apertures was
performed on images, which were stacked to increase signal to noise. Magnitude
dependence on 'seeing' was determined, and this calibration was used to
normalize photometry to constant seeing thereby maximizing photometric
accuracy. From observations of comet 17P/Holmes between 2008 October and 2009
March, a very significant outburst of 17P was found to have occurred on 2009
Jan 4.7 (\pm0.5 day). Night-to-night measurements of the brightness of the
inner coma (3000-km radius) exhibited a scatter of only 0.015-0.019 mag. No
short time-scale (<36 hr) periodicity was found in the fading lightcurve. From
literature data, it was estimated that reflected light from the nucleus
contributed 7-11% of the signal within the inner coma and it is concluded that
either the nucleus of 17P must be relatively spherical (projected axial ratio
of <1.25), or, if its shape is more typical of other comet nuclei, it has a
rotational period in excess of 10 days (assuming the observations were not made
with the nucleus 'pole-on' to the Earth). Evidence from intermittent activity
displayed by the nucleus is indicative of a possible 44-day rotation period.

primitive meteorite and interplanetary dust particles (IDPs) nucleated in a

evaporation of $\mu$m-sized silicate particles heated by a bow shock produced
by a planetesimal orbiting in the gas in the early solar nebula and
condensation of crystalline silicate from the vapor thus produced. Our
numerical simulation of shock-wave heating showed that these {\mu}m-sized
particles evaporated almost completely when the bow shock is strong enough to
cause melting of chondrule precursor dust particles. We found that the silicate
vapor cools very rapidly with expansion into the ambient unshocked nebular
region; the cooling rate is estimated, for instance, to be as high as 2000 K
s$^{-1}$ for a vapor heated by a bow shock associated with a planetesimal of
radius 1 km. The rapid cooling of the vapor leads to nonequilibrium gas-phase
condensation of dust at temperatures much lower than those expected from the
equilibrium condensation. It was found that the condensation temperatures are
lower by a few hundred K or more than the equilibrium temperatures. This
explains the results of the recent experimental studies of condensation from a
silicate vapor that condensation in such large supercooling reproduces
morphologies similar to those of silicate crystals found in meteorites. Our
results suggest strongly that the planetesimal bow shock is one of the
plausible sites for formation of not only chondrules but also other cosmic
crystals in the early solar system.

supplies hot electrons which exchange their energy with the soft photons
through Comptonization or inverse Comptonization processes. In the
sub-Keplerian component, a shock is generally produced due to the centrifugal
force. The postshock region is known as the CENtrifugal pressure-supported
BOundary Layer (CENBOL). In this paper, we compute the effects of the thermal
and the bulk motion Comptonization on the soft photons emitted from a Keplerian
disk by the CENBOL, the preshock sub-Keplerian disk and the outflowing jet. We
study the emerging spectrum when the converging inflow and the diverging
outflow (generated from the CENBOL) are simultaneously present. From the
strength of the shock, we calculate the percentage of matter being carried away
by the outflow and determine how the emerging spectrum depends on the outflow
rate. The preshock sub-Keplerian flow is also found to Comptonize the soft
photons significantly. The interplay between the up-scattering and
down-scattering effects determines the effective shape of the emerging
spectrum. By simulating several cases with various inflow parameters, we
conclude that whether the preshock flow, or the postshock CENBOL or the
emerging jet is dominant in shaping the emerging spectrum depends strongly on
the geometry of the flow and the strength of the shock in the sub-Keplerian
flow.

Prandtl and Ekman numbers for both boundary conditions. If on the other hand
one uses the helicity of the velocity field to identify flows nearly
independent of rotation, one finds the transition at a different location in
parameter space.

Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) detection. It has several outstanding
features such as constant throughput and large potential parallelism, which
makes it suitable for efficient VLSI implementation. However, to our best
knowledge, no VLSI implementation of FSD has been reported in the literature,
although some FPGA prototypes of FSD with pipeline architecture have been
developed. These solutions achieve very high throughput but at very high cost
of hardware resources, making them impractical in real applications. In this
paper, we present a novel four-nodes-per-cycle parallel architecture of FSD,
with a breadth-first processing that allows for short critical path. The
implementation achieves a throughput of 213.3 Mbps at 400 MHz clock frequency,
at a cost of 0.18 mm2 Silicon area on 0.13{\mu}m CMOS technology. The proposed
solution is much more economical compared with the existing FPGA
implementations, and very suitable for practicl applications because of its
balanced performance and hardware-complexity; moreover it has the flexibility
to be expanded into an eight-nodes-per-cycle version in order to double the
throughput.

Measurements at -10 C, 0 C, and 10 C at different bias voltages were performed.
The time resolution is best at low temperature and high over-voltage. Most
significant improvements can be achieved in cases with low number of fired

available for detection a careful optimization of temperature and operation
voltage are advisable to obtain optimum timing results with the MPPC.

simulation models one has to abstract and simplify from the real world, which
means that one has to try and capture the 'essence' of the system required for
developing a representation of the mechanisms that drive the progression in the

quantum harmonic oscillators with dipole-dipole interaction between nearest
neighbours resulting in a van der Waals type bonding. Crucial parameters in our
model are the distances between the acids and the coupling between them, which
we estimate from numerical simulations [1]. We show that for realistic
parameters nearest neighbour entanglement is present even at room temperature.
We quantify the amount of entanglement in terms of negativity and single base
von Neumann entropy. We find that the strength of the single base von Neumann
entropy depends on the neighbouring sites, thus questioning the notion of
treating single bases as logically independent units. We derive an analytical
expression for the binding energy of the coupled chain in terms of entanglement
and show the connection between entanglement and correlation energy, a quantity
commonly used in quantum chemistry.

Galaxies with photometry in $grizYHJK$ along with optical spectroscopy. A new
approach is described which utilizes color information to constrain age and
metallicity gradients. Defining an effective color gradient, $\nabla_{\star}$,
which incorporates all of the available color indices, we investigate how
$\nabla_{\star}$ varies with galaxy mass proxies, i.e. velocity dispersion,
stellar (M_star) and dynamical (M_dyn) masses, as well as age, metallicity, and
alpha/Fe. ETGs with M_dyn larger than 8.5 x 10^10, M_odot have increasing age
gradients and decreasing metallicity gradients wrt mass, metallicity, and
enhancement. We find that velocity dispersion and alpha/Fe are the main drivers
of these correlations. ETGs with 2.5 x 10^10 M_odot =< M_dyn =< 8.5 x 10^10
M_odot, show no correlation of age, metallicity, and color gradients wrt mass,
although color gradients still correlate with stellar population parameters,
and these correlations are independent of each other. In both mass regimes, the
striking anti-correlation between color gradient and alpha-enhancement is
significant at \sim 4sigma, and results from the fact that metallicity gradient
decreases with alpha/Fe. This anti-correlation may reflect the fact that star
formation and metallicity enrichment are regulated by the interplay between the
energy input from supernovae, and the temperature and pressure of the hot X-ray
gas in ETGs. For all mass ranges, positive age gradients are associated with
old galaxies (>5-7 Gyr). For galaxies younger than \sim 5 Gyr, mostly at
low-mass, the age gradient tends to be anti-correlated with the Age parameter,
with more positive gradients at younger ages.

the M81 disk for insight on galactic evolution, and compare it with that of
other galaxies, including the Milky Way. We acquired Hectospec/MMT spectra of
39 PNe and 20 HII regions, with 33 spectra viable for temperature and abundance
analysis. Our PN observations represent the first PN spectra in M81 ever
published, while several HII region spectra have been published before,
although without a direct electron temperature determination. We determine
elemental abundances of helium, nitrogen, oxygen, neon, sulfur, and argon in
PNe and HII regions, and determine their averages and radial gradients. The
average O/H ratio of PNe compared to that of the HII regions indicates a
general oxygen enrichment in M81 in the last ~10 Gyr. The PN metallicity
gradient in the disk of M81 is -0.055+-0.02 dex/kpc. Neon and sulfur in PNe
have a radial distribution similar to that of oxygen, with similar gradient
slopes. If we combine our HII sample with the one in the literature we find a
possible mild evolution of the gradient slope, with results consistent with
gradient steepening with time. Additional spectroscopy is needed to confirm
this trend. There are no Type I PNe in our M81 sample, consistently with the
observation of only the brightest bins of the PNLF, the galaxy metallicity, and
the evolution of post-AGB shells. Both the young and the old populations of M81
disclose shallow but detectable negative radial metallicity gradient, which
could be slightly steeper for the young population, thus not excluding a mild
gradients steepening with the time since galaxy formation. During its evolution
M81 has been producing oxygen; its total oxygen enrichment exceeds that of
other nearby galaxies.

electron-phonon coupling is not explicitly considered. In the GW method,
several approximations are compared and it is found that inclusion of the full

are essential for accurate calculation of the quasiparticle energy band gap.
The calculated quasiparticle energies are in good agreement with available
photoemission and inverse photoemission experiments. The results of the GW
calculations, together with the calculated static screened Coulomb interaction,
are utilized in the Bethe-Salpeter equation to calculate the dielectric
function $\epsilon_{2}(\omega)$ for both the rutile and anatase structures. The
results are in good agreement with experimental observations, particularly the
onset of the main absorption features around 4 eV. For comparison to low
temperature optical absorption measurements that resolve individual excitonic
transitions in rutile, the low-lying discrete excitonic energy levels are
calculated with electronic screening only. The lowest energy exciton found in
the energy gap of rutile has a binding energy of 0.13 eV. In agreement with
experiment, it is not dipole allowed, but the calculated exciton energy exceeds
that measured in absorption experiments by about 0.22 eV and the scale of the
exciton binding energy is also too large. The quasiparticle energy alignment of
rutile is calculated for non-polar (110) surfaces. In the GW approximation, the
valence band maximum is 7.8 eV below the vacuum level, showing a small shift

equilibrium. The entanglement entropy in this set up provides a measurement of
the quantum entanglement in the system. Using holographic techniques we recover
the same result obtained before from the study of processes triggered by a
sudden change in a parameter of the hamiltonian, known as quantum quenches.
Namely, entanglement in 2-dimensional conformal field theories propagates with
velocity v^2=1. Both in quantum quenches and in the Vaidya model equilibration
is only achieved at the local level. Remarkably, the holographic derivation of
this last fact requires information from behind the apparent horizon generated
in the process of gravitational collapse described by the Vaidya geometry. In
the early stages of the evolution the apparent horizon seems however to play no

holographically dual to the Kerr-Newman black hole, coming from the
corresponding two possible limits --- the Kerr/CFT and Reissner-Nordstr\""om/CFT
correspondences, namely there exist the Kerr-Newman/CFTs dualities. A probe
scalar field at low frequencies turns out can exhibit two different 2D
conformal symmetries (named by $J$- and $Q$-pictures, respectively) in its
equation of motion when the associated parameters are suitably specified. These
twofold dualities are supported by the matchings of entropies, absorption cross
sections and real time correlators computed from both the gravity and the CFT
sides. Our results lead to a fascinating ""microscopic no hair conjecture"" ---
for each macroscopic hair parameter, in additional to the mass of a black hole
in the Einstein-Maxwell theory, there should exist an associated holographic
CFT$_2$ description.

the first filaments containing the first star-forming halos of mass
M~10^{6}M_sun at z~20. With the help of the extended Press-Schechter formalism,
we evaluate analytically the rates of merging of the first star-forming halos
into zero-dimensional larger halos and one-dimensional first filaments. It is
shown that as the neutrino mass fraction f_{\nu} increases, the
halo-to-filament merging rate increases while the halo-to-halo merging rate
decreases sharply. For f_{\nu}<=0.04, the halo-to-filament merging rate is
negligibly low at all filament mass scales, while for f_{\nu}>=0.07 the
halo-to-filament merging rate exceeds 0.1 at the characteristic filament mass
scale of ~10^{9}M_sun. The distribution of the redshifts at which the first
filaments ultimately collapse along their longest axes is derived and found to
have a sharp maximum at z~8. We also investigate the formation and evolution of
the second generation filaments which contain the first galaxies of mass
10^{9}M_sun at z=8 as the parent of the first generation filaments. A similar
trend is found: For f_{\nu}>= 0.07 the rate of clustering of the first galaxies
into the second-generation filaments exceeds 0.3 at the characteristic mass
scale of ~10^{11}M_sun. The longest-axis collapse of these second-generation
filaments are found to occur at z~3. The implications of our results on the
formation of massive high-z galaxies and the early metal enrichment of the
intergalactic media by supernova-driven outflows, and possibility of
constraining the neutrino mass from the mass distribution of the high-z central
blackholes are discussed.

their individual minimum reward requirements. A task generates jobs that can be
given arbitrary service times before their deadlines. A task then obtains
rewards based on the service times received by its jobs. We show that this
model is compatible to the imprecise computation models and the increasing
reward with increasing service models. In contrast to previous work on these
models, which mainly focus on maximize the total reward in the system, we aim
to fulfill different reward requirements by different tasks, which offers
better fairness and allows fine-grained tradeoff between tasks. We first derive
a necessary and sufficient condition for a system, along with reward
requirements of tasks, to be feasible. We also obtain an off-line feasibility
optimal scheduling policy. We then studies a sufficient condition for a policy
to be feasibility optimal or achieves some approximation bound. This condition
can serve as a guideline for designing on-line scheduling policy and we obtains
a greedy policy based on it. We prove that the on-line policy is feasibility
optimal when all tasks have the same periods and also obtain an approximation
bound for the policy under general cases.
