techniques for exact query lookup using hashing, similarity search using exact
nearest neighbors is known to be a hard problem and in high dimensions, best
known solutions offer little improvement over a linear scan. Fast solutions to
the approximate NNS problem include Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) based
techniques, which need storage polynomial in $n$ with exponent greater than
$1$, and query time sublinear, but still polynomial in $n$, where $n$ is the
size of the database. In this work we present a new technique of solving the
approximate NNS problem in Euclidean space using a Ternary Content Addressable
Memory (TCAM), which needs near linear space and has O(1) query time. In fact,
this method also works around the best known lower bounds in the cell probe
model for the query time using a data structure near linear in the size of the
data base. TCAMs are high performance associative memories widely used in
networking applications such as access control lists. A TCAM can query for a
bit vector within a database of ternary vectors, where every bit position
represents $0$, $1$ or $*$. The $*$ is a wild card representing either a $0$ or
a $1$. We leverage TCAMs to design a variant of LSH, called Ternary Locality
Sensitive Hashing (TLSH) wherein we hash database entries represented by
vectors in the Euclidean space into $\{0,1,*\}$. By using the added
functionality of a TLSH scheme with respect to the $*$ character, we solve an
instance of the approximate nearest neighbor problem with 1 TCAM access and
storage nearly linear in the size of the database. We believe that this work
can open new avenues in very high speed data mining.

We also consider the dependence on the information used: the full galaxy power

Here, we show that when immersed in ionic solution, a layer of graphene takes
on new electrochemical properties that make it a trans-electrode. The
trans-electrode's properties are the consequence of the atomic scale proximity
of its two opposing liquid-solid interfaces together with graphene's well known
in-plane conductivity. We show that several trans-electrode properties are
revealed by ionic conductivity measurements on a CVD grown graphene membrane
that separates two aqueous ionic solutions. Despite this membrane being only
one to two atomic layers thick, we find it is a remarkable ionic insulator with
a very small stable conductivity that depends on the ion species in solution.
Electrical measurements on graphene membranes in which a single nanopore has
been drilled show that the membrane's effective insulating thickness is less
than one nanometer. This small effective thickness makes graphene an ideal
substrate for very high-resolution, high throughput nanopore based single

crucial parameter for determining whether the observed galaxies at z > 6 are
able to reionize the high-redshift intergalactic medium. Previous attempts to
measure fesc have found a wide range of values, varying from less than 0.01 to
nearly 1. Rather than finding a single value of fesc, we clarify through
modeling how internal properties of galaxies affect fesc through the density
and distribution of neutral hydrogen within the galaxy, along with the rate of
ionizing photons production. We find that the escape fraction depends
sensitively on the covering factor of clumps, along with the density of the
clumped and interclump medium. One must therefore be cautious when dealing with
an inhomogeneous medium. Fewer, high-density clumps lead to a greater escape
fraction than more numerous low-density clumps. When more ionizing photons are
produced in a starburst, fesc increases, as photons escape more readily from
the gas layers. Large variations in the predicted escape fraction, caused by
differences in the hydrogen distribution, may explain the large observed
differences in fesc among galaxies. Values of fesc must also be consistent with
the reionization history. High-mass galaxies alone are unable to reionize the
universe, because fesc > 1 would be required. Small galaxies are needed to
achieve reionization, with greater mean escape fraction in the past.

used to detect surface oceans. Exoplanets with rough surfaces, or dominated by
atmospheric Rayleigh scattering, should reach peak brightness in full phase,
orbital longitude = 180 deg, whereas ocean planets with transparent atmospheres
should reach peak brightness in crescent phase near OL = 30 deg. Application of
Fresnel theory to a planet with no atmosphere covered by a calm ocean predicts
a peak polarization fraction of 1 at OL = 74 deg; however, our model shows that
clouds, wind-driven waves, aerosols, absorption, and Rayleigh scattering in the
atmosphere and within the water column, dilute the polarization fraction and
shift the peak to other OLs. Observing at longer wavelengths reduces the
obfuscation of the water polarization signature by Rayleigh scattering but does
not mitigate the other effects. Planets with thick Rayleigh scattering
atmospheres reach peak polarization near OL = 90 deg, but clouds and Lambertian
surface scattering dilute and shift this peak to smaller OL. A shifted Rayleigh
peak might be mistaken for a water signature unless data from multiple
wavelength bands are available. Our calculations suggest that polarization
alone may not positively identify the presence of an ocean under an Earth-like
atmosphere; however polarization adds another dimension which can be used, in
combination with unpolarized orbital light curves and contrast ratios, to
detect extrasolar oceans, atmospheric water aerosols, and water clouds.
Additionally, the presence and direction of the polarization vector could be
used to determine planet association with the star, and constrain orbit
inclination.

  Superconductors via the Fluctuating Bond Model","37 pages, 5 figures, 1 table",,,,"cond-mat.supr-con","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Understanding the origin of the pseudogap is an essential step towards
elucidating the pairing mechanism in the cuprate superconductors. Recently
there has been strong experimental evidence showing that C4 symmetry breaking
occurs on formation of the pseudogap. This form of symmetry breaking was
predicted by the Fluctuating Bond Model (FBM), an empirical model based on a
strong, local coupling of electrons to the square of the planar oxygen vibrator
amplitudes. In this paper we approach the FBM theory from a new direction,
starting from {\it ab initio} molecular dynamics simulations. The simulations
demonstrate a doping-dependent instability of the in-plane oxygens towards
displacement off the Cu-O-Cu bond axis. From these results and perturbation
theory we derive an improved and quantitative form of the Fluctuating Bond
Model. A mean field solution of the FBM leads to C4 symmetry breaking in the
oxygen vibrational amplitudes, and to a d-type pseudogap in the electronic
spectrum, the features linked by recent experimental data. The phase diagram of
the pseudogap derived from mean field theory, its doping- and
temperature-dependences, including the phase boundary T$^*$, agree well with
experimental data. We extend the theory to include the long range Coulomb
interaction on the same basis as the FBM interaction. When the long-range
Coulomb interaction is included in the FBM, a CDW instability in the charge
channel is predicted which explains the nanoscale, rather than spatially
uniform, behavior of the C4 symmetry-breaking. Taking the CDW into account,
with the theoretical k-dependence of the pseudogap, enables the Fermi Surface
arc phenomenon to be understood.

Monte Carlo simulations. Their likely interpretation as blue-shifted Fe XXV and
Fe XXVI K-shell resonance lines implies an origin from highly ionized gas
outflowing with mildly relativistic velocities, in the range 0.04-0.15c. A fit
with specific photo-ionization models gives ionization parameters in the range
log_xi~4-5.6 and column densities of N_H~10^22-10^23 cm^-2. These
characteristics are very similar to those of the Ultra-Fast Outflows (UFOs)
previously observed in radio-quiet AGN. Their estimated location within
~0.01-0.3pc from the central super-massive black hole suggests a likely origin
related with accretion disk winds/outflows. Depending on the absorber covering
fraction, the mass outflow rate of these UFOs can be comparable to the
accretion rate and their kinetic power can correspond to a significant fraction
of the bolometric luminosity and is comparable to their typical jet power.
Therefore, these UFOs can play a significant role in the expected feedback from
the AGN on the surrounding environment and can give us further clues on the
relation between the accretion disk and the formation of winds/jets in both
radio-quiet and radio-loud AGN.

cases, particularly for the alpha-elements, these resemble those for stars in
the outer part of the Galactic halo, especially at the lowest metallicities
probed. The n-capture elements show a r-process distribution over the full
range of Fe-metallicity. This suggests that the duration of star formation in
the UMi dSph was shorter than in other dSph galaxies. The derived ages for a
larger sample of UMi stars with more uncertain metallicities also suggest a
population dominated by uniformly old (~13 Gyr) stars, with a hint of an
age-metallicity relationship.
  In comparing our results for UMi, our earlier work in Draco, and published
studies of more metal-rich dSph Galactic satellites, there appears to be a
pattern of moving from a chemical inventory for dSph giants with [Fe/H] < -2
dex which is very similar to that of stars in the outer part of the Galactic
halo (enhanced alpha/Fe relative to the Sun, coupled with subsolar [X/Fe] for
the heavy neutron capture elements and r-process domination), switching to
subsolar alpha-elements and super-solar s-process dominated neutron capture
elements for the highest [Fe/H] dSph stars. The combination of low star
formation rates over a varying and sometimes extended duration that produced
the stellar populations in the local dSph galaxies with [Fe/H] > -1.5 dex leads
to a chemical inventory wildly discrepant from that of any component of the

from the Very Large Array (VLA) to construct a light curve as a function of
orbital phase. We also present new X-ray data that allow us to improve the
X-ray light curve. We develop a numerical model for the colliding-wind region
and the synchrotron emission it generates. The model also includes free-free
absorption and emission due to the stellar winds of both stars. In this way we
construct artificial radio light curves and compare them with the observed one.
The observed radio fluxes show phase-locked variability. Our model can explain
this variability because the synchrotron emitting region is not completely
hidden by the free-free absorption. In order to obtain a better agreement for
the phases of minimum and maximum flux we need to use stellar wind parameters
for the binary components which are somewhat different from typical values for
single stars. We verify that the change in stellar parameters does not
influence the interpretation of the X-ray light curve. Our model has trouble
explaining the observed radio spectral index. This could indicate the presence
of clumping or porosity in the stellar wind, which - through its influence on
both the Razin effect and the free-free absorption - can considerably influence
the spectral index. Non-thermal radio emitters could therefore open a valuable
pathway to investigate the difficult issue of clumping in stellar winds.

sensors, with potentially limited sensing radius, in a network-like
environment. This model provides a compact and effective description of complex
environments as well as a proper representation of road or river networks. We
present a two-step procedure based on a discrete-time gradient ascent algorithm
to find a local optimum for this problem. The first step performs a coarse
optimization where sensors are allowed to move in the plane, to vary their
sensing radius and to make use of a reduced model of the environment called
collapsed network. It is made up of a finite discrete set of points,
barycenters, produced by collapsing network edges. Sensors can be also
clustered to reduce the complexity of this phase. The sensors' positions found
in the first step are then projected on the network and used in the second
finer optimization, where sensors are constrained to move only on the network.
The second step can be performed on-line, in a distributed fashion, by sensors
moving in the real environment, and can make use of the full network as well as
of the collapsed one. The adoption of a less constrained initial optimization
has the merit of reducing the negative impact of the presence of a large number
of local optima. The effectiveness of the presented procedure is illustrated by
a simulated deployment problem in an airport environment.

There is evidence for evolution in this luminosity function from z=6-7 to

consistent with an evolution mainly in M^*. The candidate z~8-9 galaxies we
detect have insufficient ionizing flux to reionize the Universe, and it is
probable that galaxies below our detection limit provide a significant UV
contribution. The faint-end slope, alpha, is not well constrained. However,
adopting a similiar faint-end slope to that determined at z=3-6 (alpha=-1.7)
and a Salpeter initial mass function, then the ionizing photon budget still
falls short if f_escape<0.5, even integrating down to M(UV)=-8. A steeper faint

helicity of the small-scale field being linked to the dynamo saturation process
for the large-scale field. It is a nearly conserved quantity, which allows its
evolution equation to be written in terms of production and flux terms. The
flux term can be decomposed in a variety of fashions. One particular
contribution that has been expected to play a significant role in dynamos in
the presence of mean shear was isolated by Vishniac & Cho (2001, ApJ 550, 752).
Magnetic helicity fluxes are explicitly gauge dependent however, and the
correlations that have come to be called the Vishniac-Cho flux were determined
in the Coulomb gauge, which turns out to be fraught with complications in
shearing systems. While the fluxes of small-scale helicity are explicitly gauge
dependent, their divergences can be gauge independent. We use this property to
investigate magnetic helicity fluxes of small-scale field through direct
numerical simulations in a shearing-box system and find that in a numerically
usable gauge the divergence of the small-scale helicity flux vanishes, while
the divergence of the Vishniac-Cho flux remains finite. We attribute this
seeming contradiction to the existence of horizontal fluxes of small-scale
magnetic helicity with finite divergences even in our shearing-periodic domain.

range of conditions and include the effect of a changing column density as a
function of location. The dependence of radiation pressure force on the level
of ionization and the column density are accurately computed. The main results
are: a. The mean cloud location r(BLR) and the line widths (FWHMs) are combined
in such a way that the simple virial mass estimate, r{BLR} FWHM^2/G, gives a
reasonable approximation to the black hole mass M even when radiation pressure
force is important. The reason is that L/M rather than L is the main parameter
affecting the planar cloud motion. b. Reproducing the observed mean radius,
FWHM and intensity of H-beta and CIV 1549 requires at least two different
populations of clouds. c. The cloud location is a function of both L^{1/2} and
L/M. Given this we suggest a new approximation for r(BLR) which, when inserted
into the BH mass equation, results in a new approximation for M. The new
expression involves L^{1/2}, FWHM and two constants that are obtained from a
comparison with available M-sigma mass estimates. It deviates only slightly
from the old mass estimate at all luminosities. d. The quality of present black

Using data from the literature combined with new data from the DEEP2 and AEGIS
surveys we show that there is a consistent observational and theoretical
picture for the evolution of these scaling relations from z\sim 2 to z=0. The
evolution of the observed stellar scaling relations is weaker than that of the
virial scaling relations of dark matter haloes, which can be reproduced, both
qualitatively and quantitatively, with a simple, cosmologically-motivated model
for disk evolution inside growing NFW dark matter haloes. In this model optical
half-light radii are smaller, both at fixed stellar mass and maximum circular
velocity, at higher redshifts. This model also predicts that the scaling
relations between baryonic quantities evolve even more weakly than the
corresponding stellar relations. We emphasize, though, that this weak evolution
does not imply that individual galaxies evolve weakly. On the contrary,
individual galaxies grow strongly in mass, size and velocity, but in such a way
that they move largely along the scaling relations. Finally, recent
observations have claimed surprisingly large sizes for a number of star-forming
disk galaxies at z \sim 2, which has caused some authors to suggest that high
redshift disk galaxies have abnormally high spin parameters. However, we argue
that the disk scale lengths in question have been systematically overestimated
by a factor \sim 2, and that there is an offset of a factor \sim 1.4 between
H\alpha sizes and optical sizes. Taking these effects into account, there is no
indication that star forming galaxies at high redshifts (z\sim 2) have
abnormally high spin parameters.

quasars (BLQSOs) that self-consistently corrects for incompleteness and the
statistical uncertainty in the mass estimates, based on a sample of 9886
quasars at 1 < z < 4.5 drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We find
evidence for `cosmic downsizing' of black holes in BLQSOs, where the peak in
their number density shifts to higher redshift with increasing black hole mass.
The cosmic mass density for black holes seen as BLQSOs peaks at z ~ 2. We
estimate the completeness of the SDSS as a function of black hole mass and
Eddington ratio, and find that at z > 1 it is highly incomplete at M_BH < 10^9
M_Sun and L / L_Edd < 0.5. We also estimate a lower limit on the lifetime of a
single BLQSO phase and we place constraints on the maximum mass of a black hole
in a BLQSO. Our estimated distribution of BLQSO Eddington ratios peaks at L /
L_Edd ~ 0.05 and has a dispersion of ~ 0.4 dex, implying that most BLQSOs are
not radiating at or near the Eddington limit; however the location of the peak
is subject to considerable uncertainty. The steep increase in number density of
BLQSOs toward lower Eddington ratios is expected if the BLQSO accretion rate
monotonically decays with time. Furthermore, our estimated lifetime and
Eddington ratio distributions imply that the majority of the most massive black
holes spend a significant amount of time growing in an earlier obscured phase,
a conclusion which is independent of the unknown obscured fraction. These
results are consistent with models for self-regulated black hole growth, at
least for massive systems at z > 1, where the BLQSO phase occurs at the end of
a fueling event when black hole feedback unbinds the accreting gas, halting the
accretion flow.

scalar poles in physical amplitudes involving the stress-energy tensor. These
poles may be described by a local effective action with massless scalar fields,
which couple to classical sources, contribute to gravitational scattering
processes, and can have long range gravitational effects at macroscopic scales.
In an effective field theory approach, the effective action of the anomaly is
an infrared relevant term that should be added to the Einstein-Hilbert action
of classical General Relativity to take account of macroscopic quantum effects.
The additional scalar degrees of freedom contained in this effective action may
be understood as responsible for both the Casimir effect in flat spacetime and
large quantum backreaction effects at the horizon scale of cosmological
spacetimes. These effects of the trace anomaly imply that the cosmological
vacuum energy is dynamical, and its value depends on macroscopic boundary
conditions at the cosmological horizon scale, rather than sensitivity to the
extreme ultraviolet Planck scale.

general considerations of the interstellar medium. Outer and integrated colours
of AGN hosts generally agree with the control galaxies, regardless of X-ray
obscuration, but the nuclear colours of unobscured AGNs are typically much
bluer, especially for X-ray luminous objects. Visible point sources are seen in
many of these, indicating that the nuclear colours have been contaminated by
AGN light and that obscuration of the X-ray radiation and visible light are
therefore highly correlated. Red AGN hosts are typically slightly bluer than
red-sequence control galaxies, which suggests that their stellar populations
are slightly younger. We compare these colour data to current models of AGN

versus time that would follow a hypothetical brief burst of star formation -
can shed light on SN progenitors and physics. We compile recent measurements of
the Type-Ia SN (SN Ia) rate in galaxy clusters at redshifts z=0-1.45. Together
with the observed iron-to-stellar mass ratio in clusters, which constrains the
time-integrated number of SN Ia events in clusters, we recover the DTD of SNe
Ia in cluster environments. The DTD peaks at the shortest time-delay interval
we probe, 0<t<2.2 Gyr, with a low tail out to delays of ~10 Gyr, and is
remarkably consistent with several recent DTD reconstructions based on
different methods, in different environments. We test DTD models from the
literature, requiring that they simultaneously reproduce the observed cluster
SN rates and the observed iron-to-stellar mass ratios. A power-law DTD of the
form t^{-1.2+/-0.3}, extending to a Hubble time, can satisfy both constraints.
Shallower power laws, such as t^{-1/2} cannot, assuming a single DTD, and a
single star-formation burst (either brief or extended) at high z. This implies
50-85% of SNe Ia explode within 1 Gyr of star formation. DTDs from
double-degenerate (DD) models, which generically have ~t^{-1} shapes over a
wide range of timescales, match the data, but only if their predictions are
scaled up by factors of 5-10. Single degenerate (SD) DTDs always give poor fits
to the data, due to a lack of delayed SNe and overall low numbers of SNe. The
observations also permit a combination of two SN Ia populations - prompt (e.g.
SD) SNe Ia that explode within a few Gyr of star formation, and produce about
60% of the iron mass in clusters, and a DD population that contributes the
events seen at z<1.4. Our results support the existence of a DD progenitor
channel for SNe Ia, if the overall predicted numbers can be suitably increased.

brown dwarfs, extending the temperature sequence down to less than 500 K and
constraining the faint end of the luminosity function. One interesting
implication of the derived luminosity function is that the brown dwarf census
in the immediate (<10 pc) solar neighborhood is still largely incomplete, and
some bright (J<16) brown dwarfs remain to be identified in existing surveys.
These objects are especially interesting as they are the ones that can be
studied in most detail, especially with techniques that require large fluxes
(e.g. time-variability, polarimetry, high-resolution spectroscopy) that cannot
realistically be applied to objects uncovered by deep surveys. By
cross-matching the DENIS and the 2MASS point-source catalogs, we have
identified an overlooked brown dwarf -DENIS J081730.0-615520- that is the
brightest field mid-T dwarf in the sky (J = 13.6). We present astrometry and
spectroscopy follow-up observations of this brown dwarf. Our data indicate a
spectral type T6 and a distance -from parallax measurement- of 4.9\pm0.3 pc,
placing this mid-T dwarf among the 3 closest isolated brown dwarfs to the Sun.

about a near disc center sunspot region, NOAA AR 9661. We compare the
characteristics of Stokes profiles in terms of Doppler shifts and asymmetries
among the three spectral lines, which helps us to better understand the
chromospheric lines and the magnetic and flow fields in different magnetic
regions. The main results are: (1) For penumbral area observed by the
photospheric FeI lines, Doppler velocities derived from Stokes I (Vi) are very
close to those derived from linear polarization profiles (Vlp) but
significantly different from those derived from Stokes V profiles (Vzc), which
provides direct and strong evidence that the penumbral Evershed flows are
magnetized and mainly carried by the horizontal magnetic component. (2) The
rudimentary inverse Evershed effect observed by the MgI b2 line provides a
qualitative evidence on its formation height that is around or just above the
temperature minimum region. (3) Vzc and Vlp in penumbrae and Vzc in pores
generally approach their Vi observed by the chromospheric MgI line, which is
not the case for the photospheric FeI lines. (4) Outer penumbrae and pores show
similar behavior of the Stokes V asymmetries that tend to change from positive
values in the photosphere (FeI lines) to negative values in the low
chromosphere (MgI line). (5) The Stokes V profiles in plage regions are highly
asymmetric in the photosphere and more symmetric in the low chromosphere. (6)
Strong red shifts and large asymmetries are found around the magnetic polarity
inversion line within the common penumbra of the Delta spot. This study thus
emphasizes the importance of spectro-polarimetry using chromospheric lines.

achromatic in the usual sense because their polarimetric properties vary with

oscillators with random intrinsic frequencies. When the coupling $K$ is larger
than a threshold $K_E$, there is a macroscopic cluster of
frequency-synchronized oscillators. We explain why the macroscopic cluster
disappears at $K_E$. We view the system in terms of vortices, since cluster
boundaries are delineated by the motion of these topological defects. In the
entrained phase ($K>K_E$), vortices move in fixed paths around clusters, while
in the unentrained phase ($K<K_E$), vortices sometimes wander off. These
deviant vortices are responsible for the disappearance of the macroscopic
cluster. The regularity of vortex motion is determined by whether clusters
behave as single effective oscillators. The unentrained phase is also
characterized by time-dependent cluster structure and the presence of chaos.
Thus, the entrainment transition is actually an order-chaos transition. We
present an analytical argument for the scaling $K_E\sim K_L$ for small
lattices, where $K_L$ is the threshold for phase-locking. By also deriving the
scaling $K_L\sim\log N$, we thus show that $K_E\sim\log N$ for small $N$, in
agreement with numerics. In addition, we show how to use the linearized model
to predict where vortices are generated.

the presence of a cylindrical excitation i.e. a concentrated point force.
Elliptic cloaking for flexural waves involves a density and an orthotropic
Young's modulus which depend on the radial and azimuthal positions, as deduced
from a coordinates transformation for circular cloaks in the spirit of Pendry

comprises chaotic dynamics of interacting wave ""clusters"" consisting of
discrete (often finite) number of connected resonant wave triads (or quarters).
Kinetic WT refers to the infinite-box theory, described by well-known
wave-kinetic equations. Mesoscopic WT is a regime in which either the discrete
and the kinetic evolutions alternate, or when none of these two types is purely
realized. We argue that in mesoscopic systems the wave spectrum experiences a
sandpile behavior. Importantly, the mesoscopic regime is realized for a broad
range of wave amplitudes which typically spans over several orders on
magnitude, and not just for a particular intermediate level.

due to the interaction between Rydberg atoms only a single atom can be
resonantly excited in the ensemble. This restricts the state space of the
ensemble to the collective ground state |G> and the collectively excited state
|E> with a single Rydberg excitation distributed evenly on all atoms. The
collectively enhanced coupling of all atoms to the cavity field with coherent
coupling strengths which are much larger than the decay rates in the system
leads to the strong coupling regime of the resulting effective Jaynes-Cummings
model. We use numerical simulations to show that the cavity transmission can be
used to reveal detailed properties of the Jaynes-Cummings ladder of excited
states, and that the atomic nonlinearity gives rise to highly non-trivial
photon emission from the cavity. Finally, we suggest that the absence of
interactions between remote Rydberg atoms may, due to a combinatorial effect,
induce a cavity-assisted excitation blockade whose range is larger than the

formalism in many approaches to systems monitoring via runtime verification.
However, since their elements are infinite words, not every omega-regular
language can sensibly be monitored at runtime when only a finite prefix of a
word, modelling the observed system behaviour so far, is available. The
monitorability of an omega-regular language, L, is thus a property that holds,
if for any finite word u, observed so far, it is possible to add another finite
word v, such that uv becomes a ""finite witness"" wrt. L; that is, for any
infinite word w, we have that uvw \in L, or for any infinite word w, we have
that uvw \not\in L. This notion has been studied in the past by several
authors, and it is known that the class of monitorable languages is strictly
more expressive than, e.g., the commonly used class of so-called safety
languages. But an exact categorisation of monitorable languages has, so far,
been missing. Motivated by the use of linear-time temporal logic (LTL) in many
approaches to runtime verification, this paper first determines the complexity
of the monitorability problem when L is given by an LTL formula. Further, it
then shows that this result, in fact, transfers to omega-regular languages in
general, i.e., whether they are given by an LTL formula, a nondeterministic
Buechi automaton, or even by an omega-regular expression.

parameters with 1$\sigma$ (68%) errors for the Phantom Crossing DGP model are
$\Omega_{m,0}=0.27^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$, $\beta=0.54^{+0.24}_{-0.30}$. We find that
the Phantom Crossing DGP model is more compatible with the observations than
the original DGP model or the DGP model developed by Dvali and Turner. Our
model can realize late-time acceleration of the universe, similar to that of
$\Lambda$CDM model, without dark energy due to the effect of DGP gravity. In
our model, crossing of the phantom divide occurs at a redshift of $z \sim 0.2$.

to account for the apparently power-like behavior of transverse momenta
observed in the data even at a few GeV/c. In such an approach this behavior is
attributed to some specific intrinsic fluctuations of the temperature $T$ in
the hadronizing system and is fully accounted by the nonextensivity parameter
$q$. On the other hand, it was recently shown that similar power-law spectra
can also be obtained by introducing some specific volume fluctuations,
apparently without invoking the introduction of Tsallis statistics. We
demonstrate that, in fact, when the total energy is kept constant, these volume
fluctuations are equivalent to temperature fluctuations and can be derived from
them. In addition, we show that fluctuations leading to multiparticle power-law
Tsallis distributions introduce specific correlations between the considered
particles. We then propose a possible way to distinguish the fluctuations in
each event from those occurring from event-to-event. This could have
applications in the analysis of high density events at LHC (and especially in

line and place a 3-sigma upper limit on the relative depths of <0.04 for the
broad Ca II absorption produced by the SNR. We detect narrow low and high
velocity absorption components of Ca II. High velocity |V(LSR)|=100-140 km/s

Hamiltonian spinons can be interpreted as domain walls (DWs) separating
degenerate ground states. In dimension $d>1$, the issue of spinons as
elementary excitations is still unsettled. In this paper, we study two
spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ AFM ladder models in which the individual chains are
described by the Ising-like Heisenberg Hamiltonian. The rung exchange
interactions are assumed to be pure Ising-type in one case and Ising-like
Heisenberg in the other. Using the low-energy effective Hamiltonian approach in
a perturbative formulation, we show that the spinons are coupled in bound
pairs. In the first model, the bound pairs are delocalized due to a four-spin
ring exchange term in the effective Hamiltonian. The appropriate dynamic
structure factor is calculated and the associated lineshape is found to be
almost symmetric in contrast to the 1d case. In the case of the second model,
the bound pair of spinons lowers its kinetic energy by propagating between
chains. The results obtained are consistent with recent theoretical studies and
experimental observations on ladder-like materials.

equivalent, via the Polhmeyer reduction, to a relativistic integrable field
theory known as a symmetric space sine-Gordon theory. These theories can be
formulated as integrable deformations of gauged WZW models. In this work we
consider the class of symmetric spaces CP^{n+1} and solve the corresponding
generalized sine-Gordon theories at the quantum level by finding the exact

magnons, as a result of the quantum group deformation parameter q being a root
of unity. We test the S-matrix by taking the semi-classical limit and comparing
with the time delays for the scattering of classical solitons. We argue that
the internal CP^{n-1} moduli space of collective coordinates of the solitons in
the classical theory can be interpreted as a q-deformed fuzzy space in the
quantum theory. We analyse the n=1 case separately and provide a further test
of the S-matrix conjecture in this case by calculating the central charge of

However, depending on the model of the source, the definition of the point

formulated in several ways. Here, a distinction is made between a soft source

number field $K$ was the realm of class field theory. The subject of embedding
orders contained in the ring of integers of maximal subfields $L$ of such an
algebra into orders in that algebra is more nuanced. The first such result
along those lines is an elegant result of Chevalley \cite{Chevalley-book} which
says that with $B = M_n(K)$ the ratio of the number of isomorphism classes of
maximal orders in $B$ into which the ring of integers of $L$ can be embedded
(to the total number of classes) is $[L \cap \widetilde K : K]^{-1}$ where
$\widetilde K$ is the Hilbert class field of $K$. Chinburg and Friedman
(\cite{Chinburg-Friedman}) consider arbitrary quadratic orders in quaternion
algebras satisfying the Eichler condition, and Arenas-Carmona
\cite{Arenas-Carmona} considers embeddings of the ring of integers into maximal
orders in a broad class of higher rank central simple algebras. In this paper,
we consider central simple algebras of dimension $p^2$, $p$ an odd prime, and
we show that arbitrary commutative orders in a degree $p$ extension of $K$,
embed into none, all or exactly one out of $p$ isomorphism classes of maximal
orders. Those commutative orders which are selective in this sense are
explicitly characterized; class fields play a pivotal role. A crucial
ingredient of Chinberg and Friedman's argument was the structure of the tree of
maximal orders for $SL_2$ over a local field. In this work, we generalize

perturbations of Wigner matrices when the dimension goes to infinity. The
entries of the Hermitian Wigner matrix have a distribution which is symmetric
and satisfies a Poincar\'e inequality. The perturbation matrix is a
deterministic Hermitian matrix whose spectral measure converges to some
probability measure with compact support. We assume that this perturbation
matrix has a fixed number of fixed eigenvalues (spikes) outside the support of
its limiting spectral measure whereas the distance between the other
eigenvalues and this support uniformly goes to zero as the dimension goes to
infinity. We establish that only a particular subset of the spikes will
generate some eigenvalues of the deformed model which will converge to some
limiting points outside the support of the limiting spectral measure. This
phenomenon can be fully described in terms of free probability involving the
subordination function related to the additive free convolution of the limiting
spectral measure of the perturbation matrix by a semi-circular distribution.
Note that up to now only finite rank perturbations had been considered (even in
the deformed GUE case).

concentrated along a single or double stripe in the two-dimensional (2D) plane.
The model can be realized in terms of nonlinear optics (in the spatial and
temporal domains alike) and BEC. In recent works, it was concluded that search
for stable 2D solitons in models with a spatially localized self-attractive
nonlinearity is a challenging problem. We make use of the variational
approximation (VA) and numerical methods to investigate conditions for the
existence and stability of solitons in the present setting. The result
crucially depends on the transverse shape of the stripe: while the rectangular
profile supports stable 2D solitons, its smooth Gaussian-shaped counterpart
makes all the solitons unstable. The double stripe with the rectangular profile
admit stable solitons of three distinct types: symmetric and asymmetric ones
with a single peak, and double-peak symmetric solitons. The shape and stability
of single-peak solitons of either type are accurately predicted by the VA.
Collisions between stable solitons are briefly considered too, by means of
direct simulations. Depending on the relative velocity we observe excitation,
decay or catastrophic self focusing.

to rule out the lowest scaling factors between CO luminosity and molecular gas

into water-filled cylindrical nanopores in equilibrium with a bulk reservoir.
It is shown that (i) an ion located in a neutral pore undergoes two opposing
mechanisms: the deformation of its surrounding ionic cloud of opposite charge,
with respect to the reservoir, which increases the surface tension and tends to
exclude ions form the pore, and (ii) the attractive contribution to the ion
self-energy of the repulsive image forces associated with the dielectric jump
between the solvent and the pore wall, which becomes more and more screened
when ions enter the pore. For pore radii around 1 nm and bulk concentrations
lower than 0.2 mol/L, this mechanism leads to a first-order phase transition,
similar to capillary ""evaporation"", from an ionic-penetration state to an
ionic-exclusion state. The discontinuous phase transition survives within the
biological concentration range (~ 0.15 mol/L) for small enough membrane
dielectric permittivities (< 5). In the case of a weakly charged pore,
counterion penetration exhibits a non-monotonic behaviour and is characterized
by two regimes: at low reservoir concentration or small pore radii, coions are
excluded and the energy barrier for counterions is reduced but image forces
remain strong enough, so that the counterion partition coefficient in the pore
decreases with increasing reservoir concentration up to a characteristic value;
for larger reservoir concentrations, image forces are screened and the
partition coefficient of counterions increases with the reservoir electrolyte
concentration.

manipulated the dynamics of systems ranging from atoms to biomolecules.
Surprisingly, these collective works indicate that the effort (i.e., the number
of algorithmic iterations) required to find an optimal control field appears to
be essentially invariant to the complexity of the system. The present work
explores this matter in a series of systematic optimizations of the
state-to-state transition probability on model quantum systems with the number
of states $N$ ranging from 5 through 100. The optimizations occur over a
landscape defined by the transition probability as a function of the control
field. Previous theoretical studies on the topology of quantum control
landscapes established that they should be free of sub-optimal traps under
reasonable physical conditions. The simulations in this work include nearly
5000 individual optimization test cases, all of which confirm this prediction
by fully achieving optimal population transfer of at least 99.9% upon careful
attention to numerical procedures to ensure that the controls are free of
constraints. Collectively, the simulation results additionally show invariance
of required search effort to system dimension $N$. This behavior is
rationalized in terms of the structural features of the underlying control
landscape. The very attractive observed scaling with system complexity may be
understood by considering the distance traveled on the control landscape during
a search and the magnitude of the control landscape slope. Exceptions to this
favorable scaling behavior can arise when the initial control field fluence is
too large or when the target final state recedes from the initial state as $N$
increases.

oxides and their consequences on the effective dielectric spectra of such
materials. The first one is the polaronic localisation at the unit cell scale
on residual impurities in ferroelectric networks. The second one is the
collective localisation of free charge at macroscopic interfaces like surfaces,
electrodes and grain boundaries in ceramics. Polarons have been observed in
many oxide perovskites mostly when cations having several stable electronic
configurations are present. In manganites, the density of such polarons is so
high as to drive a net lattice of interacting polarons. On the other hand, in
ferroelectric materials like BaTiO3 and LiNbO3, the density of polarons is
usually very small but they can influence strongly the macroscopic
conductivity. The contribution of such polarons to the dielectric spectra of
ferroelectric materials is described. Even residual impurities as for example
Iron can induce well defined anomalies at very low temperatures. This is mostly
resulting from the interaction between localised polarons and the highly
polarisable ferroelectric network in which they are embedded. The case of such
residual polarons in SrTiO3 will be described in more details, emphasizing the
quantum polaron state at liquid helium temperatures. Recently, several
non-ferroelectric oxides have been shown to display giant effective dielectric
permittivity. It is first shown that the frequency/temperature behaviour of
such parameters is very similar in very different compounds (donor doped
BaTiO3, CaCu3Ti4O12, LuFe2O4,Li doped NiO,...). This similarity calls for a
common origin of the giant dielectric permittivity in these compounds. A space
charge localisation at macroscopic interfaces can be the key for such extremely
high dielectric permittivity.

evaporation of monomers. By combining theoretical and numerical methods, we
establish a clearer understanding of the non-equilibrium phase transition known
to occur in such systems. The transition is between a growing phase in which
the total mass increases for all time and a non-growing phase in which the
total mass is bounded. In addition to deriving rigorous bounds on the position
of the transition point, we show that the growing phase is in the same
universality class as diffusion-aggregation models with deposition but no
evaporation. In this regime, the flux of mass in mass space becomes
asymptotically constant (as a function of mass) at large times. The magnitude
of this flux depends on the evaporation rate but the fact that it is
asymptotically constant does not. The associated constant flux relation exactly
determines the scaling of the two-point mass correlation function with mass in
all dimensions while higher-order mass correlation functions exhibit nonlinear
multi-scaling in dimension less than 2. If the deposition rate is below some
critical value, a different stationary state is reached at large times
characterised by a global balance between evaporation and deposition with a
scale-by-scale balance between the mass fluxes due to aggregation and
evaporation. Both the mass distribution and the flux decay exponentially in
this regime. Finally, we develop a scaling theory of the model near the
critical point, which yields non-trivial scaling laws for the critical
two-point mass correlation function with mass. These results are well supported
by numerical measurements.

that integrated computation and long-term storage. In these systems, reliable
applications could be engineered without requiring the programmer to write
translation code to manage the transfer of data to and from non-volatile
storage. More importantly, it simplified the programmer's conceptual model of
an application, and avoided the many coherency problems that result from
multiple cached copies of the same information. Although technically
innovative, persistent languages were not widely adopted, perhaps due in part
to their closed-world model. Each persistent store was located on a single
host, and there were no flexible mechanisms for communication or transfer of
data between separate stores. Here we re-open the work on persistence and
combine it with modern peer-to-peer techniques in order to provide support for
orthogonal persistence in resilient and potentially long-running distributed
applications. Our vision is of an infrastructure within which an application
can be developed and distributed with minimal modification, whereupon the
application becomes resilient to certain failure modes. If a node, or the
connection to it, fails during execution of the application, the objects are
re-instantiated from distributed replicas, without their reference holders
being aware of the failure. Furthermore, we believe that this can be achieved
within a spectrum of application programmer intervention, ranging from minimal
to totally prescriptive, as desired. The same mechanisms encompass an
orthogonally persistent programming model. We outline our approach to
implementing this vision, and describe current progress.

considers systems where multiple planets are seen to transit the same star and
concludes that such ""multi-transiting"" systems will be the most
information-rich planetary systems besides our own solar system. Five new
candidate multi-transiting systems from \emph{Kepler} have been announced in
Steffen et al. 2010, though these candidates have not yet been fully confirmed
as planets. In anticipation of the likely confirmation of multi-transiting
systems, we discuss the value of these systems in detail. For example, proper
interpretation of transit timing variations is significantly improved in
multi-transiting systems. The true mutual inclination, a valuable probe of
planetary formation, can also be well determined in certain systems, especially
through Rossiter-McLaughlin measurements of each planet. In addition, such
systems may undergo predictable and observable mutual events, where one planet
crosses over the other, which allow for unique constraints on various physical
and orbital parameters, particularly the mutual inclination.

  Application Logic from Distribution","Submitted to EuroSys 2006",,,"University of St Andrews CS/06/2","cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Middleware technologies often limit the way in which object classes may be
used in distributed applications due to the fixed distribution policies that
they impose. These policies permeate applications developed using existing
middleware systems and force an unnatural encoding of application level
semantics. For example, the application programmer has no direct control over
inter-address-space parameter passing semantics. Semantics are fixed by the
distribution topology of the application, which is dictated early in the design
cycle. This creates applications that are brittle with respect to changes in
distribution. This paper explores technology that provides control over the
extent to which inter-address-space communication is exposed to programmers, in
order to aid the creation, maintenance and evolution of distributed
applications. The described system permits arbitrary objects in an application
to be dynamically exposed for remote access, allowing applications to be
written without concern for distribution. Programmers can conceal or expose the
distributed nature of applications as required, permitting object placement and
distribution boundaries to be decided late in the design cycle and even
dynamically. Inter-address-space parameter passing semantics may also be
decided independently of object implementation and at varying times in the
design cycle, again possibly as late as run-time. Furthermore, transmission
policy may be defined on a per-class, per-method or per-parameter basis,
maximizing plasticity. This flexibility is of utility in the development of new
distributed applications, and the creation of management and monitoring
infrastructures for existing applications.

The framework addresses adaptability through its ability to represent a wide
range of specific middleware policies. Adaptiveness is supported by a rich
contextual model, through which an application programmer may control precisely
how policies should be selected for any particular interaction with the
middleware. A contextual pattern mechanism facilitates the succinct expression
of both coarse- and fine-grain policy contexts. Policies may be specified and
altered dynamically, and may themselves take account of dynamic conditions. The

ferromagnetic insulating manganite is found to have frequency independent
ferromagnetic to paramagnetic transition temperature at around 140 K. At around
90 K (\approx T_f) the sample shows a second frequency dependent re - entrant
magnetic transition as explored through complex ac susceptibility measurements.
Non linear ac susceptibility measurements (higher harmonics of ac
susceptibility) have also been performed (with and without the superposition of
a dc magnetic field) to further investigate the origin of this frequency
dependence (dynamic behavior at this re-entrant magnetic transition).
Divergence of 3rd order susceptibility in the limit of zero exciting field
indicates a spin glass like freezing phenomena. However, large value of spin
relaxation time (?0= 10-8 s) and small value of coercivity (~22 Oe) obtained at
low temperature (below T_f) from critical slowing down model and dc magnetic
measurements, respectively, are in contrast with what generally observed in a
canonical spin glass (?0 = 10-12 - 10-14 s and very large value of coercivity
below freezing temperature). We have attributed our observation to the
formation of finite size ferromagnetic clusters which are formed as consequence
of intrinsic separation and undergo cluster glass like freezing below certain
temperature in this under doped manganite. The results are supported by the
electronic - and magneto - transport data.

and Sarti. One of the main features of this model is that the primary visual
cortex V1 lifts an image from $R^2$ to the bundle of directions of the plane.
Neurons are grouped into orientation columns, each of them corresponding to a
point of this bundle.
  In this model a corrupted image is reconstructed by minimizing the energy
necessary for the activation of the orientation columns corresponding to
regions in which the image is corrupted. The minimization process intrinsically
defines an hypoelliptic heat equation on the bundle of directions of the plane.
  In the original model, directions are considered both with and without
orientation, giving rise respectively to a problem on the group of
rototranslations of the plane SE(2) or on the projective tangent bundle of the
plane $PTR^2$.
  We provide a mathematical proof of several important facts for this model. We
first prove that the model is mathematically consistent only if directions are
considered without orientation. We then prove that the convolution of a
$L^2(R^2,R)$ function (e.g. an image) with a 2-D Gaussian is generically a
Morse function. This fact is important since the lift of Morse functions to
$PTR^2$ is defined on a smooth manifold. We then provide the explicit
expression of the hypoelliptic heat kernel on $PTR^2$ in terms of Mathieu
functions.
  Finally, we present the main ideas of an algorithm which allows to perform
image reconstruction on real non-academic images. A very interesting point is
that this algorithm is massively parallelizable and needs no information on
where the image is corrupted.

the statistical physics of plastic deformations in amorphous solids made of $N$
particles is investigated. We recognize three regimes of temperature where the
statistics are qualitatively different. In the first regime the temperature is
very low, $T<T_{\rm cross}(N)$, and the strain is quasi-static. In this regime
the elasto-plastic steady state exhibits highly correlated plastic events whose
statistics are characterized by anomalous exponents. In the second regime
$T_{\rm cross}(N)<T<T_{\rm max}(\dot\gamma)$ the system-size dependence of the
stress fluctuations becomes normal, but the variance depends on the strain
rate. The physical mechanism of the cross-over is different for increasing
temperature and increasing strain rate, since the plastic events are still
dominated by the mechanical instabilities (seen as an eigenvalue of the Hessian
matrix going to zero), and the effect of temperature is only to facilitate the
transition. A third regime occurs above the second cross-over temperature
$T_{\rm max}(\dot\gamma)$ where stress fluctuations become dominated by thermal
noise. Throughout the paper we demonstrate that scaling concepts are highly
relevant for the problem at hand, and finally we present a scaling theory that
is able to collapse the data for all the values of temperatures and strain
rates, providing us with a high degree of predictability.
