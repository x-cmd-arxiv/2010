circumstellar orbits of a tight binary system. We include both the
gravitational perturbations of the secondary star and a non-linear gas drag
stemming from an eccentric gas disk with a finite precession rate. We consider
several precession rates and eccentricities for the gas, and compare the
results with a static disk in circular orbit.
  The disk precession introduces three main differences with respect to the
classical static case: (i) The equilibrium secular solutions generated by the
gas drag are no longer fixed points in the averaged system, but limit cycles
with frequency equal to the precession rate of the gas. The amplitude of the
cycle is inversely dependent on the body size, reaching negligible values for
$\sim 50$ km size planetesimals. (ii) The maximum final eccentricity attainable
by small bodies is restricted to the interval between the gas eccentricity and
the forced eccentricity, and apsidal alignment is no longer guaranteed for
planetesimals strongly coupled with the gas. (iii) The characteristic
timescales of orbital decay and secular evolution decrease significantly with
increasing precession rates, with values up to two orders of magnitude smaller
than for static disks.
  Finally, we apply this analysis to the $\gamma$-Cephei system and estimate
impact velocities for different size bodies and values of the gas eccentricity.
For high disk eccentricities, we find that the disk precession decreases the
velocity dispersion between different size planetesimals, thus contributing to
accretional collisions in the outer parts of the disk. The opposite occurs for
almost circular gas disks, where precession generates an increase in the
relative velocities.

parameter pair indicates an evident correlation among the five parameters,
which suggests that at least $\sim$4 parameters are needed to model burst
temporal and spectral behavior. In addition, our studies reveal that these FRED
pulses have correlated properties: (i) long-duration pulses have harder spectra
and are less luminous than short-duration pulses; (ii) the more asymmetric the
pulses are the steeper the evolutionary curves of the peak energy ($E_{p}$) in

exponent 'alpha=alpha0=0' it is retrieved the isotropic McVittie (McV) metric
and for 'alpha=alpha0=1' it is retrieved the locally anisotropic

1' exists an event horizon at the SC radius 'r1=2GM/c^2' and only for
'alpha=alpha0>= 3' space-time is singularity free for this value of the radius.
These bounds exclude the previous existing metrics, for which the SC radius is
a naked extended singularity. In addition it is shown that for 'alpha=alpha0>5'
space-time is approximately Ricci flat in a neighborhood of the event horizon
such that the SC metric is a good approximation in this neighborhood. It is

expanding locally anisotropic metric ansatz with respect to approximately

point-like matter distributions on the expanding Universe also allowing for a
covariant parameterization of gravitational interactions at intermediate length
scales.
  As an example of applicability it is modeled a disk galaxy model matching the
physical parameters of the galaxy UGC2885 and it is shown that, by fine-tuning
the metric functional parameter, the flattening of the galaxy rotation curve is
fully parameterized by this metric. In addition it is numerically computed the
mass-energy density corrections due to the expanding anisotropic background and
explicitly shown that although there are negative contributions within the
galaxy plane the total mass-energy density is strictly positive both at the
galaxy plane and outside the galaxy plane. As the functional parameter for this
metric is an exponential factor is required a floating point precision of $250$
significant digits for root finding routines and $200$ significant digits to
evaluate the effective mass-energy density rendering a final precision of the
results presented above double precision ($16$ significant digits).

excellent approximations to various derivative functions, including those used
in modeling important physical processes on uniform grids. However, our

constrain current prescriptions of common-envelope (CE) evolution. Analyzing a
new sample of PCEBs we derive constraints on one of the most important
parameters in the field of close compact binary formation, i.e. the CE
efficiency alpha. After reconstructing the post-CE evolution and based on fits
to stellar evolution calculations as well as a parametrized energy equation for
CE evolution that incorporates realistic approximations of the binding energy
parameter lambda, we determine the possible evolutionary histories of the
observed PCEBs. We also reconstruct CE evolution replacing the classical energy
equation with a scaled angular momentum equation and compare the results
obtained with both algorithms. We find that all PCEBs in our sample can be
reconstructed with the energy equation if the internal energy of the envelope
is included. Although most individual systems have solutions for a broad range
of values for alpha, only for alpha=0.2-0.3 do we find simultaneous solutions
for all PCEBs in our sample. If we adjust alpha to this range of values, the
values of the angular momentum parameter gamma cluster in a small range of
values. In contrast if we fix gamma to a small range of values that allows us
to reconstruct all our systems, the possible ranges of values for alpha remains
broad for individual systems. The classical parametrized energy equation seems
to be an appropriate prescription of CE evolution and turns out to constrain
the outcome of the CE evolution much more than the alternative angular momentum
equation. If there is a universal value of the CE efficiency, it should be in
the range of alpha=0.2-0.3. We do not find any indications for a dependence of
alpha on the mass of the secondary star or the final orbital period.

The TB densities of states(DOS) are also in very good agreement with those from
the LAPW in the above energy range, including the per orbital decomposition. We
use our results to provide insights on the existence of a pseudogap in the DOS

strain $h$ reduces to integration of $\psi_4$ twice in time. Integrations
performed in either the time or frequency domain, however, lead to secular

linear drifts. We identify a number of fundamental difficulties which can arise
from integrating finite length, discretely sampled and noisy data streams.
These issues are an artifact of post-processing data. They are independent of

waveforms in the frequency domain, which is effective at strongly reducing
spurious secular non-linear drifts in the resulting strain.

chains translocating through a nanopore in presence of asymmetric solvent
conditions. Initially a large fraction ($>$ 50%) of the chain is placed at the
\textit{cis} side in a good solvent while the $trans$ segments are placed in a
bad solvent that causes the chain to collapse and promotes translocation from
the $cis$ to the $trans$ side. In particular, we study the ratcheting effect of
a globule formed at the \textit{trans} side created by the translocated
segment, and how this ratchet drives the system towards faster translocation.
Unlike in the case of unbiased or externally forced translocation where the
mean first passage time $\langle \tau \rangle $ is often characterized by
algebraic scaling as a function of the chain length $N$ with a single scaling
exponent $\alpha$, and the histogram of the mean first passage time
$P(\tau/\langle\tau \rangle)$ exhibits scaling, we find that scaling is not
well obeyed. For relatively long chains we find $\langle \tau \rangle \sim
N^\alpha$ where $\alpha \approx 1$ for $\varepsilon/k_{B}T > 1$. In this limit,
we also find that translocation proceeds with a nearly constant velocity of the
individual beads(monomers), which is attributed to the coiling of the globule.
We provide an approximate theory assuming rotat ional motion restricted on a 2D
disc to demonstrate that there is a crossover from diffusive behavior of the
center of mass for short chains to a single file translocation for long chains,
where the average translocation time scales linearly with the chain length $N$.

sterile neutrinos by measuring the disappearance of electron anti-neutrinos.
This channel is particularly sensitive since it allows to use inverse beta
decay as detection reaction; thus it is free from hadronic uncertainties,
provided the neutrino energy is below the pion production threshold. This
corresponds to a choice of the Lorentz gamma=30 for the 6He parent ion.
Moreover, a disappearance measurement allows the constraint of sterile neutrino
properties independently of any CP violating effects. A moderate detector size
of a few 100 tons and ion production rates of 2E13 per second are sufficient to
constrain mixing angles as small as \sin^22\theta=0.01 at 99% confidence level.

to determine the asymptotic convergence characteristics of the imaginary-time

proved that when the cumulant expansion is truncated at order $p$, the
asymptotic convergence rate of the density matrix behaves like $N^{-(2p+1)}$.
The complex algebra associated with the proof is simplified by introducing a
diagrammatic representation of the contributing terms along with an associated
linked-cluster theorem. The cumulant terms at each order are expanded in a
series such that the the asymptotic convergence rate is maintained without the
need to calculate the full cumulant at order $p$. Using this truncated
expansion of each cumulant at order $p$, the numerical cost in developing
Fourier path integral expressions having convergence order $N^{-(2p+1)}$ is
shown to be approximately linear in the number of required potential energy

We extend the previous validation of the general estimator using local map

reconstructing the WMAP bispectrum using $l<500$ multipoles and $n=31$
orthonormal 3D eigenmodes. We constrain all popular nearly scale-invariant

parameter $\Fnl$ normalised to the local case, to allow more direct comparison
between different models.) Notable new constraints from our method include
those for the constant model $\Fnl = 35.1 \pm 27.4 $, the flattened model $\Fnl
= 35.4\pm 29.2$, and warm inflation $\Fnl = 10.3\pm 27.2$. We investigate
feature models surveying a wide parameter range in both the scale and phase,
and we find no significant evidence of non-Gaussianity in the models surveyed.
We propose a measure $\barFnl$ for the total integrated bispectrum and find
that the measured value is consistent with the null hypothesis that CMB

densities, the gravitational interaction with self-gravitating wakes becomes
important.
  We also perform realistic three dimensional, collisional N-body simulations
with up to a quarter of a million particles. A new set of pseudo shear periodic
boundary conditions is used which reduces the computational costs by an order
of magnitude compared to previous studies. Our analytic estimates are confirmed
to within a factor of two.
  On short timescales the evolution is always dominated by stochastic effects
caused by collisions and gravitational interaction with self-gravitating ring
particles. These result in a random walk of the moonlet's semi-major axis. The
eccentricity of the moonlet quickly reaches an equilibrium value due to
collisional damping. The average change in semi-major axis of the moonlet after

direction of several hundred kilometres. We expect that such a shift is easily

clusters of galaxies on hadronic models for the origin of cluster radio halos.
In hadronic models, the inelastic proton-proton collisions responsible for the
production of the electron-positron population fueling the observed synchrotron
radio emission yield a gamma-ray flux, from the decay of neutral pions, whose
spectrum and normalization depend on the observed radio emissivity and on the
cluster magnetic field. We thus infer lower limits on the average cluster
magnetic field in hadronic models from the Fermi gamma-ray limits. We also
calculate the corresponding maximal energy density in cosmic rays and the
minimal-guaranteed gamma-ray flux from hadronic radio-halo models. We find that
the observationally most interesting cases correspond to clusters with large
radio emissivities featuring soft spectra. Estimates of the central magnetic
field values for those clusters are larger than, or close, to the largest
magnetic field values inferred from Faraday rotation measures of clusters,
placing tension on the hadronic origin of radio halos. In most cases, however,
we find that the Fermi data do not per se rule out hadronic models for cluster
radio halos as the expected gamma-ray flux can be pushed below the Fermi
sensitivity for asymptotically large magnetic fields. We also find that cosmic
rays do not contribute significantly to the cluster energy budget for nearby
radio halo clusters.

connection in X-ray hardness and X-ray to radio ratio between the jet and one
of the X-ray components within the core spectrum. We observe wedge-like
depressions in diffuse X-ray surface brightness surrounding the jets, and
interpret them as regions where an aged population of electrons provides
pressure to balance the interstellar medium of NGC 4261. About 20% of the mass
of the interstellar medium has been displaced by the radio source. Treating 3C
270 as a twin-jet system, we find an interesting agreement between the ratio of
jet-to-counterjet length in X-rays and that expected if X-rays are observed
over the distance that an outflow from the core would have traveled in ~6x10^4
yr. X-ray synchrotron loss times are shorter than this, and we suggest that
most particle acceleration arises as a result of turbulence and dissipation in
a stratified flow. We speculate that an episode of activity in the central
engine beginning ~6x10^4 yr ago has led to an increased velocity shear. This
has enhanced the ability of the jet plasma to accelerate electrons to
X-ray-synchrotron-emitting energies, forming the X-ray jet and counterjet that
we see today.

depletion of gas resulting from quasar-driven outflows should eventually stop
star-formation in the host galaxy and lead the black hole to ""suicide"" for
starvation. Direct observational evidence for a major quasar feedback onto the
host galaxy is still missing, since outflows previously observed in quasars are
generally associated with the ionized component of the gas, which only accounts
for a minor fraction of the total gas content, and typically occurring in the
central regions. We used the IRAM PdB Interferometer to observe CO(1-0) in Mrk

activity on the same timescale. The inferred kinetic energy in the molecular
outflow is ~1.2e44 erg/s, corresponding to a few percent of the AGN bolometric

feedback to highly supersonic shocks generated by radiatively accelerated

These techniques are ideally suited to the MSSM, since the lightest Higgs boson
overwhelmingly decays to $b\bar{b}$ throughout the entire parameter space,
while the heavier neutral Higgs bosons, if light enough to be produced in a
cascade, also predominantly decay to $b\bar{b}$. The Higgs production we
consider arises from superpartner production where superpartners cascade decay
into Higgs bosons. We study this mode of Higgs production for several
superpartner hierarchies: $m_{\tilde{q}}, m_{\tilde g} >
m_{\tilde{W},\tilde{B}} > m_h + \mu$; $m_{\tilde{q}}, m_{\tilde g} >
m_{\tilde{W},\tilde{B}} > m_{h,H,A} + \mu$; and $m_{\tilde{q}}, m_{\tilde g} >
m_{\tilde{W}} > m_h + \mu$ with $m_{\tilde{B}} \simeq \mu$. In these cascades,
the Higgs bosons are boosted, with $p_T > 200$ GeV a large fraction of the
time. Since Higgs bosons appear in cascades originating from squarks and/or
gluinos, the cross section for events with at least one Higgs boson can be the
same order as squark/gluino production. Given 10 fb$^{-1}$ of 14 TeV LHC data,
with $m_{\tilde{q}} \lsim 1$ TeV, and one of the above superpartner mass
hierarchies, our estimate of $S/\sqrt{B}$ of the Higgs signal is sufficiently
high that the $b\bar{b}$ mode can become the discovery mode of the lightest
Higgs boson of the MSSM.

focus on the phenomenon of misaligned disc components and find that the outer
disc warp is a consequence of the misalignment between the inner disc and the
surrounding hot gaseous halo. As the infalling cold gas sinks toward the centre
of the galaxy, it is strongly torqued by the hot gas halo. By the time the
fresh gas reaches the central disc-forming region its angular momentum is
completely aligned with the spin of the hot gas halo. If the spin of the hot
gas halo, in turn, is not aligned with that of the inner disc, a misaligned
outer disc forms comprised of newly accreted material. The inner and outer
components are misaligned with each other because they respond differently to
infalling substructure and accretion. The warped disc feeds the main gas disc
due to viscous angular momentum losses, but small amounts of star formation in
the warp itself form a low-metallicity thick disc. We show that observations of
resolved stellar populations in warped galaxies in the local universe could
provide evidence for the presence of these processes and therefore indirectly
reveal ongoing gas accretion and the existence of hot gas halos.

can undergo mergers with other compact objects, such as stellar mass black
holes (BHs) and neutron stars (NSs). We derive the frequency of such mergers

and IMBH-BH binaries are sources of gravitational waves (GWs), which might
allow us to reveal the presence of IMBHs. We thus examine their detectability
by current and future GW observatories, both ground- and space-based. In
particular, as representative of different classes of instruments we consider
Initial and Advanced LIGO, the Einstein gravitational-wave Telescope (ET) and
the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). We find that IMBH mergers are
unlikely to be detected with instruments operating at the current sensitivity
(Initial LIGO). LISA detections are disfavored by the mass range of IMBH-NS and
IMBH-BH binaries: less than one event per year is expected to be observed by
such instrument. Advanced LIGO is expected to observe a few merger events
involving IMBH binaries in a 1-year long observation. Advanced LIGO is
particularly suited for mergers of relatively light IMBHs (~100 Msun) with
stellar mass BHs. The number of mergers detectable with ET is much larger: tens
(hundreds) of IMBH-NS (IMBH-BH) mergers might be observed per year, according
to the runaway collapse scenario for the formation of IMBHs. We note that our
results are affected by large uncertainties, produced by poor observational

the evolution of the YC density with redshift.[abridged]

about the activity of the other users, and thus furnishes the basis for

the proposed regions for the Gaussian channel. Part I: achievable region. We
propose that the generalized feedback is used to gain knowledge about the
message sent by other user and then exploited in two ways: (a) to {\em relay}
the messages that can be decoded at both destinations--thus realizing the gains
of beam-forming of a distributed multi-antenna system--and (b) to {\em hide}
the messages that can not be decoded at the non-intended destination--thus
leveraging the interference ""pre-cancellation"" property of dirty-paper-type
coding. We show that our achievable region generalizes several known achievable
regions for IFC-GF and that it reduces to known achievable regions for some of
the channels subsumed by the IFC-GF model.

important role in future wireless networks, many challenges are still unsolved.
Previous research has developed different relaying strategies for cooperative
multiple access channels (CMA), cooperative multiple relay channels (CMR) and
cooperative broadcast channels (CBC). However, there lacks a unifying strategy
that is universally optimal for these three classical channel models.
Sequential slotted amplify and forward (SSAF) strategy was previously proposed
to achieve the optimal diversity and multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) for CMR. In
this paper, the use of SSAF strategy is extended to CBC and CMA, and its
optimality for both of them is shown. For CBC, a CBC-SSAF strategy is proposed
which can asymptotically achieve the DMT upper bound when the number of
cooperative users is large. For CMA, a CMA-SSAF strategy is proposed which even
can exactly achieve the DMT upper bound with any number of cooperative users.
In this way, SSAF strategy is shown to be universally optimal for all these
three classical channel models and has great potential to provide universal
optimality for wireless cooperative networks.

transactions progressing through a distributed system, modeled as a queueing
network, is considered. Two forms of monitoring information are considered,
viz., locally unique transaction identifiers, and arrival and departure
timestamps of transactions at each processing queue. The timestamps are assumed
available at all the queues but in the absence of identifiers, only enable
imprecise tracking since parallel processing can result in out-of-order
departures. On the other hand, identifiers enable precise tracking but are not
available without proper instrumentation. Given an instrumentation budget, only
a subset of queues can be selected for production of identifiers, while the
remaining queues have to resort to imprecise tracking using timestamps. The
goal is then to optimally allocate the instrumentation budget to maximize the
overall tracking accuracy. The challenge is that the optimal allocation
strategy depends on accuracies of timestamp-based tracking at different queues,
which has complex dependencies on the arrival and service processes, and the
queueing discipline. We propose two simple heuristics for allocation by
predicting the order of timestamp-based tracking accuracies of different
queues. We derive sufficient conditions for these heuristics to achieve
optimality through the notion of stochastic comparison of queues. Simulations
show that our heuristics are close to optimality, even when the parameters

strip positions of the horizontal branch, a restriction that is absent for the
Cepheids in stellar aggregates with a variety of ages.
  To show the similarity of the strip amplitude fine structure for RRL and
Cepheids we make a grid of lines of constant amplitude in the HR diagram of the
strip using amplitude data for classical Cepheids in the Galaxy, LMC, and SMC.
The model implicit in the grid, that also contains lines of constant period, is
used to predict the correlations between period, amplitude, and color for the
two Oosterhoff RRL groups in globular clusters. The good agreement of the
predictions with the observations using the classical Cepheid amplitude fine
structure also for the RRL shows one aspect of the unity of the pulsation
processes between the two classes of variables.

objects, is analyzed by compressed sensing (CS) techniques. The notion of
restricted isometry property (RIP) and an upper bound on the restricted
isometry constant (RIC) are employed to establish sufficient conditions for the
exact localization by MUSIC with or without the presence of noise. In the
noiseless case, the sufficient condition gives an upper bound on the numbers of
random sampling and incident directions necessary for exact localization. In
the noisy case, the sufficient condition assumes additionally an upper bound
for the noise-to-object ratio in terms of the RIC and the condition number of
objects. Rigorous comparison of performance between MUSIC and the CS
minimization principle, Lasso, is given. In general, the MUSIC algorithm
guarantees to recover, with high probability, $s$ scatterers with $n=\cO(s^2)$
random sampling and incident directions and sufficiently high frequency. For
the favorable imaging geometry where the scatterers are distributed on a
transverse plane MUSIC guarantees to recover, with high probability, $s$
scatterers with a median frequency and $n=\cO(s)$ random sampling/incident
directions. Numerical results confirm that the Lasso outperforms MUSIC in the
well-resolved case while the opposite is true for the under-resolved case. The
latter effect indicates the superresolution capability of the MUSIC algorithm.
Another advantage of MUSIC over the Lasso as applied to imaging is the former's
flexibility with grid spacing and guarantee of {\em approximate} localization
of sufficiently separated objects in an arbitrarily fine grid. The error can be
bounded from above by $\cO(\lambda s)$ for general configurations and
$\cO(\lambda)$ for objects distributed in a transverse plane.

and combining different low-level heuristics into a problem specific and
effective strategy. Hyper-heuristics raise the level of generality on automated
problem solving by attempting to select and/or generate tailored heuristics for

proposed for this. In this paper, we explore an elegant nature-inspired
alternative based on self-assembly construction processes, in which structures
emerge out of local interactions between autonomous components. This idea
arises from previous works in which computational models of self-assembly were
subject to evolutionary design in order to perform the automatic construction

population models. We extend our study to higher galaxy mass via a novel
literature compilation of 37 early-type galaxies, which provides stellar
population properties out to one effective radius. We find that metallicity
gradients correlate with galactic mass, and the relationship shows a sharp
change in slope at a dynamical mass of 3.5 10^10 M_{sun}. The central and mean
values of the stellar population parameters (measured in r < r_e/8, and at r =
r_e, respectively) define positive mass trends. We suggest that the low
metallicities, almost solar [alpha/Fe] ratios and the tight mass-metallicity
gradient relation displayed by the low-mass galaxies are indicative of an early
star-forming collapse with extended (i.e., > 1 Gyr), low efficiency star
formation, and mass-dependent galactic outflows of metal-enriched gas. The
flattening of metallicity gradients in high-mass galaxies, and the broad
scatter of the relationship are attributed to merger events. The high
metallicities and supersolar abundances shown by these galaxies imply a rapid,
high efficiency star formation. The observed [Z/H]--mass and [alpha/Fe]--mass
relationships can be interpreted as a natural outcome of an early star-forming
collapse. However, we find that hierarchical galaxy formation models
implementing mass-dependent star formation efficiency, varying IMF, energy
feedback via AGN, and the effects due to merger-induced starbursts can also
reproduce both our observed relationships.

  in Social Media?","31 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables",,,,"cs.CY physics.soc-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/","  This article investigates the impact of user homophily on the social process
of information diffusion in online social media. Over several decades, social
scientists have been interested in the idea that similarity breeds connection:
precisely known as ""homophily"". Homophily has been extensively studied in the
social sciences and refers to the idea that users in a social system tend to
bond more with ones who are similar to them than to ones who are dissimilar.
The key observation is that homophily structures the ego-networks of
individuals and impacts their communication behavior. It is therefore likely to
effect the mechanisms in which information propagates among them. To this
effect, we investigate the interplay between homophily along diverse user
attributes and the information diffusion process on social media. In our
approach, we first extract diffusion characteristics---corresponding to the
baseline social graph as well as graphs filtered on different user attributes
(e.g. location, activity). Second, we propose a Dynamic Bayesian Network based
framework to predict diffusion characteristics at a future time. Third, the
impact of attribute homophily is quantified by the ability of the predicted
characteristics in explaining actual diffusion, and external variables,
including trends in search and news. Experimental results on a large Twitter
dataset demonstrate that choice of the homophilous attribute can impact the
prediction of information diffusion, given a specific metric and a topic. In
most cases, attribute homophily is able to explain the actual diffusion and
external trends by ~15-25% over cases when homophily is not considered.

the masses at a specific position in the chain is able to constrain the
vibration of the system to oscillate at a specific frequency. The damped mass

adopt a definition that identified the circular component of a loop current as
the sole source of the magnetic field induced in the loop. The latter may be
associated with the field at the loop center, with the magnetic moment
associated with this field or with the total magnetic flux threading the loop.
We show that all three definitions yield an identical measure of the loop

associated induced magnetic field. Finally, we consider circular currents in
several molecular structures: benzene, azulene, naphthalene and anthracene and
show that circular currents occur generically in such structures and can be, in
certain voltage ranges, considerably larger than the net current through the

inhibiting thermalization of the electron with the surface at short timescales.

equipped with artificial conductivity, is able to capture the physics of
density/energy discontinuities in the case of the so-called shearing layers
test, a test for examining Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instabilities. We can trace
back each failure of SPH to show KH rolls to two causes: i) shock waves
travelling in the simulation box and ii) particle clumping, or more generally,
particle noise. The probable cause of shock waves is the Local Mixing
Instability (LMI), previously identified in the literature. Particle noise on
the other hand is a problem because it introduces a large error in the SPH
momentum equation.
  We also investigate the role of artificial conductivity (AC). Including AC is
necessary for the long-term behavior of the simulation (e.g. to get
$\lambda=1/2, 1$ KH rolls). In sensitive hydrodynamical simulations great care
is however needed in selecting the AC signal velocity, with the default
formulation leading to too much energy diffusion. We present new signal
velocities that lead to less diffusion.
  The effects of the shock waves and of particle disorder become less important
as the time-scale of the physical problem (for the shearing layers problem:
lower density contrast and higher Mach numbers) decreases. At the resolution of
current galaxy formation simulations mixing is probably not important. However,
mixing could become crucial for next-generation simulations.

non-equilibrium with the temperature $\Delta T$ of one end and zero temperature
of the other. This approach allows significant decrease of computational time
at $\Delta T \to 0$. The threshold temperature $T_{\rm thr}$ is found which
scales $T_{\rm thr}(N) \sim N^{-3}$ with the lattice size $N$ and by convention
separates two mechanisms of heat conductance: phonon mechanism dominates at $T
< T_{\rm thr}$ and the soliton contribution increases with temperature at $T >
T_{\rm thr}$. Solitons and breathers are directly visualized in numerical
experiments. The problem of heat conductance in non-linear lattices in the
limit $\Delta T \to 0$ can be reduced to the heat conductance of harmonic
lattice with time-dependent stochastic rigidities determined by the equilibrium
process at temperature $T$. The detailed analysis is done for the $\beta$-FPU

positron beam becomes unstable with beam currents in the order of 200-300 mA.
The longitudinal instability is damped by bringing the positron beam in
collision with a high current electron beam (~2A). Besides, we have observed a
shift of \approx 600Hz in the residual synchrotron sidebands. Precise
measurements have been performed by using both a commercial spectrum analyzer

quietly during few days before becoming suddenly eruptive and launching a
coronal mass ejection (CME). The precise origin of the eruption is still
debated. Among several mechanisms, it has been proposed that a loss of
equilibrium, or an ideal magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) instability such as the
torus instability, could be responsible for the sudden eruptivity. Distinct
approaches have also been formulated for limit cases having circular or
translation symmetry. We revisit the previous theoretical approaches, setting
them in the same analytical framework. The coronal field results from the
contribution of a non-neutralized current channel added to a background
magnetic field, which in our model is the potential field generated by two
photospheric flux concentrations. The evolution on short Alfvenic time scale is
governed by ideal MHD. We show analytically first that the loss of equilibrium
and the stability analysis are two different views of the same physical
mechanism. Second, we identify that the same physics is involved in the
instability of circular and straight current channels. Indeed, they are just
two particular limiting case of more general current paths. A global
instability of the magnetic configuration is present when the current channel
is located at a coronal height, h, large enough so that the decay index of the
potential field, (d ln |Bp|) / (d ln h) is larger than a critical value. At the
limit of very thin current channels, previous analysis found a critical decay
index of 1.5 and 1 for circular and straight current channels, respectively.
However, with current channels being deformable and as thick as expected in the
corona, we show that this critical index has similar values for circular and
straight current channels, typically in the range [1.1,1.3].

when scientists adhere to a norm of exclusivity in selecting similar partners

between scientists can be assessed are their research specialties and status
positions. Second, focus constraint shapes collaboration when connections among
scientists depend on opportunities for social contact. Constraint comes in two
forms, depending on whether it originates in institutional or geographic space.
Institutional constraint refers to the tendency of scientists to select
collaborators within rather than across institutional boundaries. Geographic
constraint is the principle that, when collaborations span different
institutions, they are more likely to involve scientists that are
geographically co-located than dispersed. To study homophily and focus
constraint, the paper will argue in favour of an idea of collaboration that
moves beyond formal co-authorship to include also other forms of informal
intellectual exchange that do not translate into the publication of joint work.
A community-detection algorithm is applied to the co-authorship network of the
scientists that submitted in Business and Management in the 2001 UK RAE. While
results only partially support research-based homophily, they indicate that
scientists use status positions for discriminating between potential partners
by selecting collaborators from institutions with a rating similar to their
own. Strong support is provided in favour of institutional and geographic
constraints. Scientists tend to forge intra-institutional collaborations; yet,
when they seek collaborators outside their own institutions, they tend to
select those who are in geographic proximity.

symmetry with respect to a tilt of a quantized vortex line does not yet
prohibit coupling between Kelvin waves and the large-scale slope of the line.
Ironically, the counterexample of an effective scattering vertex in the local
induction approximation (LIA) attempted by Lebedev and L'vov invalidates their
logic all by itself being a notoriously known example of how symmetries impose
stringent constraints on kelvon kinetics---not only the coupling in question
but the kinetics in general are absent within LIA. We further explain that the
mistake arises from confusing symmetry properties of a specific mathematical
representation in terms of the canonical vortex position field w(z) = x(z) +
iy(z), which explicitly breaks the tilt symmetry due to an arbitrary choice of
the z-axis, with those of the real physical system recovered in final
expressions.

Surprisingly, the superhumps found during superoutburst continue to be detected

of superhump period over the presumed orbital period suggests a relatively high
binary mass ratio in a system where the radius of the accretion disk must vary
by less than 2% in order to maintain tidal precession throughout the extended
episode of superhumping. Disk radius is less restricted if the quiescent signal
identified tentatively as the orbital period is a negative superhump, generated

coherent aperiodic undulations of the order parameter (OP), critical slowing
down of the collective mode, and evolution of the particle-hole gap appearing

Numerical modeling based on Ginzburg-Landau theory is used to reproduce the
observations without free parameters. The close analogy with other Higgs
potentials in particle physics\cite{Higgs} gives new insight into hitherto
unexplored dynamics of both single particle and collective excitations through

led to detailed studies of interactions between the velocity and the magnetic
field and between scales. In particular, processes such as induction and dynamo
action, the damping of velocity fluctuations by the Lorentz force, or the
development of anisotropies, can be characterized at different scales. In this
context we consider three different configurations often studied in the
literature: mechanically forced turbulence, freely decaying turbulence, and
turbulence in the presence of a uniform magnetic field. Each configuration is
of interest for different geophysical and astrophysical applications. Local and
non-local transfers are discussed for each case. While the transfer between
scales of solely kinetic or solely magnetic energy is local, transfers between
kinetic and magnetic fields are observed to be local or non-local depending on
the configuration. Scale interactions in the cascade of magnetic helicity are
also reviewed. Based on the results, the validity of several usual assumptions
in hydrodynamic turbulence, such as isotropy of the small scales or
universality, is discussed.

ensuring current matching for tandem cells. This paper explores the further
advantage afforded by the indication that QWSCs operate in the radiative limit
because radiative contribution to the dark current is seen to dominate in
experimental data at biases corresponding to operation under concentration. The
dark currents of QWSCs are analysed in terms of a light and dark current model.
The model calculates the spectral response (QE) from field bearing regions and
charge neutral layers and from the quantum wells by calculating the confined
densities of states and absorption coefficient, and solving transport equations
analytically. The total dark current is expressed as the sum of depletion layer
and charge neutral radiative and non radiative currents consistent with
parameter values extracted from QE fits to data. The depletion layer dark
current is a sum of Shockley-Read-Hall non radiative, and radiative
contributions. The charge neutral region contribution is expressed in terms of
the ideal Shockley radiative and non-radiative currents modified to include
surface recombination. This analysis shows that the QWSC is inherently subject
to the fundamental radiative efficiency limit at high currents where the
radiative dark current dominates, whereas good homojunction cells are well
described by the ideal Shockley picture where the limit is determined by
radiative and non radiative recombination in the charge neutral layers of the
cell.

periodic solids and difficult to study in experiments. Here, we investigate a
decagonal and a dodecagonal quasicrystal using molecular dynamics simulations
of the Lennard-Jones-Gauss interaction system. We observe that the short time
dynamics is dominated by stochastic particle motion, so-called phason flips,
which can be either single-particle jumps or correlated ring-like
multi-particle moves. Over long times, the flip mechanism is efficient in
reordering the quasicrystals and can generate diffusion. The temperature
dependence of diffusion is described by an Arrhenius law. We also study the
spatial distribution and correlation of mobile particles by analyzing the
dynamic propensity.

  Michigan Math Journal, 2012",,,,"math.DG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The generalized Chen's conjecture on biharmonic submanifolds asserts that any
biharmonic submanifold of a non-positively curved manifold is minimal (see
e.g., [CMO1], [MO], [BMO1], [BMO2], [BMO3], [Ba1], [Ba2], [Ou1], [Ou2], [IIU]).
In this paper, we prove that this conjecture is false by constructing
foliations of proper biharmonic hyperplanes in a 5-dimensional conformally flat
space with negative sectional curvature. Many examples of proper biharmonic
submanifolds of non-positively curved spaces are also given.

x^n+y^m=c(x^k)(y^l), where n,m,k,l,c are natural numbers.We investigate this
equation from the point of view of positive integer solutions.A preliminary
examination of sources such as reference[1](L.E.Dickson's History of the Theory
of Numbers, Vol.II) and [2](W.Sierpinski's Elementary Theory of Numbers) shows
that little or no material can be found regarding this diophantine
equation.Note that when c=1, (x,y)=(1,1) is a solution regardless of the values
of the exponents n,m,k,and l. In Section3, five results from number theory are
listed.The first four are well known and are stated without proof.Result5 is of
central importance and it is used in the proofs of most of the nine theorems of
this paper.We offer a detailed proof of Result5. The entire paper is organized
according to eight cases. Here is a sample of two of the nine theorems. In
Theorem2, we prove that if n<or=k and n<m<k+l, then the above has no positive
integer solutions if c is not equal to 2;if c=2, then the above equation has
the unique solution(x,y)=(1,1). In Theorem5, part(vi), we prove that if c=3,
n-k=1,l=1,and m-n=1.Then the above equation has exactly two solutions:the
(x,y)=(2,2),(2^k+1,2^k).

three-sphere. This is an energy supercritical model which is known to exhibit
finite time blow up via self-similar solutions. The ground state self-similar
solution $f_0$ is known in closed form and based on numerics, it is supposed to
describe the generic blow up behavior of the system. In this paper we develop a
rigorous linear perturbation theory around $f_0$. This is an indispensable
prerequisite for the study of nonlinear stability of the self-similar blow up
which is conducted in a companion paper. In particular, we prove that $f_0$ is
linearly stable if it is mode stable. Furthermore, concerning the mode
stability problem, we prove new results that exclude the existence of unstable
eigenvalues with large imaginary parts and also, with real parts larger than
1/2. The remaining compact region is well-studied numerically and all available
results strongly suggest the nonexistence of unstable modes.
