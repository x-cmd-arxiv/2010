simultaneously. Human operators work on one of those three virtual

charges for PF injection and the primary electron for positron generation are
50-times different, and beam energies for PF and HER injection are 3-times

adjustments for those virtual accelerators have to be performed. In order to
cure such a situation, beam energy feedback system was installed that can
respond to each of virtual accelerators independently.

what may define future mobile social networks. With the introduction of novel
behavior-aware protocols, services and architectures, there is a pressing need
to understand and realistically model mobile users behavioral characteristics,
their similarity and clustering. Such models are essential for the analysis,
performance evaluation, and simulation of future DTNs. This paper addresses
issues related to mobile user similarity, its definition, analysis and
modeling. To define similarity, we adopt a behavioral-profile based on users
location preferences using their on-line association matrix and its SVD, then
calculate the behavioral distance to capture user similarity. This measures the
difference of the major spatio-temporal behavioral trends and can be used to
cluster users into similarity groups or communities. We then analyze and
contrast similarity distributions of mobile user populations in two settings:
(i) based on real measurements from four major campuses with over ten thousand
users for a month, and (ii) based on existing mobility models, including random
direction and time-varying community models. Our results show a rich set of
similar communities in real mobile societies with distinct behavioral clusters
of users. This is true for all the traces studied, with the trend being
consistent over time. Surprisingly, however, we find that the existing mobility
models do not explicitly capture similarity and result in homogeneous users
that are all similar to each other. Thus the richness and diversity of user
behavioral patterns is not captured to any degree in the existing models. These
findings strongly suggest that similarity should be explicitly captured in
future mobility models, which motivates the need to re-visit mobility modeling
in the future.

pressure values of non-thermal radio-emitting particles derived from the radio
maps are not sufficient to inflate the X-ray cavities. We propose using the
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect, whose intensity strongly depends on the
pressure, to find the hitherto undetected, dynamically-dominant component in
the radio cocoons.
  We demonstrate that the spectral function at a frequency of 217 GHz has an
absolute maximum at a temperature higher than $10^9$ K, therefore the
measurement of the SZ effect at this frequency is a powerful tool for
potentially revealing the dynamically-dominant component inside AGN jet-driven
radio cocoons. A new method is proposed for excluding the contribution from the
low energy, non-relativistic electrons to the SZ effect by means of
observations at two frequencies. We show how one may correct for a possible
contribution from the kinematic SZ effect. The intensity maps of the SZ effect
are calculated for the self-similar Sedov solution, and application of a
predicted ring-like structure on the SZ map at a frequency of 217 GHz is
proposed to determine the energy released during the active jet stage. The SZ
intensity map for an AGN cocoon in a distant elliptical is calculated using a
2-D numerical simulation and including relativistic corrections to the SZ
effect. We show the intensity spectrum of the SZ effect is flat at high

from that of the literature, which typically uses Nielsen number theory,
because Nielsen numbers of iterates are difficult to compute except in special

Lefschetz number. Instead we use some fixed point theory from the point of view
of real algebraic geometry, and some intersection theory in the context of De
Rham theory on surfaces and combine it with some observations of dynamical
system theory which started from the work of Sarkovskii. However, in the
special case of the homotopical dynamics of a two dimensional torus, where the
Nielsen number is determined by the modulus of the Lefschetz number, we recover
a result in [1].

density in the bulk is carried entirely by fluxes. The dimensionless magnetic
field to charge density ratio for these solutions is bounded from below, with a
quantum critical point appearing at the lower bound. Using matched asymptotic

(quant-ph/0509044): the matter field can be naturally eliminated from the

independent dynamics of the electromagnetic field (they form a closed system of
partial differential equations). An improved derivation of this surprising
result is offered in the current work. It is also shown that for this system of
equations, a generalized Carleman linearization (Carleman embedding) procedure
generates a system of linear equations in the Hilbert space, which looks like a
second-quantized theory and is equivalent to the original nonlinear system on
the set of solutions of the latter. Thus, the relevant local realistic model
can be embedded into a quantum field theory. This model is equivalent to a
well-established model - the scalar electrodynamics, so it correctly describes
a large body of experimental data. Although it does not describe the electronic
spin and possibly some other experimental facts, it may be of great interest as
a ""no drama quantum theory"", as simple (in principle) as classical
electrodynamics. Possible issues with the Bell theorem are discussed.

simulation results show that the formation process is divided into three stages
qualitatively: the formation of wake-like density structures, the creation of
planetesimal seeds, and their collisional growth. The linear analysis of the
dissipative gravitational instability shows that the dust layer is secularly
unstable although Toomre's $Q$ value is larger than unity. However, in the
initial stage, the growth time of the gravitational instability is longer than
that of the dust sedimentation and the decrease in the velocity dispersion.
Thus, the velocity dispersion decreases and the disk shrinks vertically. As the
velocity dispersion becomes sufficiently small, the gravitational instability
finally becomes dominant. Then wake-like density structures are formed by the
gravitational instability. These structures fragment into planetesimal seeds.
The seeds grow rapidly owing to mutual collisions.

successful aperture masking programs underway worldwide, pupil remapping offers
the advantage of spatial filtering (with single-mode fibers) and in principle
can avoid the penalty of low throughput inherent to an aperture mask. However
in practice, pupil remapping presents a number of difficult technological
challenges including injection into the fibers, pathlength matching of the

penalized regressions. Our regression model adds one mean shift parameter for
each of the $n$ data points. We then apply a regularization favoring a sparse
vector of mean shift parameters. The usual $L_1$ penalty yields a convex
criterion, but we find that it fails to deliver a robust estimator. The $L_1$
penalty corresponds to soft thresholding. We introduce a thresholding (denoted
by $\Theta$) based iterative procedure for outlier detection ($\Theta$-IPOD). A
version based on hard thresholding correctly identifies outliers on some hard
test problems. We find that $\Theta$-IPOD is much faster than iteratively
reweighted least squares for large data because each iteration costs at most
$O(np)$ (and sometimes much less) avoiding an $O(np^2)$ least squares estimate.
We describe the connection between $\Theta$-IPOD and $M$-estimators. Our
proposed method has one tuning parameter with which to both identify outliers
and estimate regression coefficients. A data-dependent choice can be made based
on BIC. The tuned $\Theta$-IPOD shows outstanding performance in identifying
outliers in various situations in comparison to other existing approaches. This
methodology extends to high-dimensional modeling with $p\gg n$, if both the
coefficient vector and the outlier pattern are sparse.

planetary nebula (PN) surrounded by self-similar shocked dense shell and outer
slow AGB wind envelope involving self-gravity and compare/fit our computational
model results with available observations of a few grossly spherical X-ray
emitting PNe. Matching shocked piecewise isothermal self-similar void (ISSV)
solutions with self-gravity of Lou & Zhai (LZ) for the outer zone and a
stationary isothermal fast tenuous wind with a reverse shock for the inner zone
across an expanding contact discontinuity, we can consistently construct
dynamic evolution models of PNe with diffuse X-ray emissions. On the basis of
such a chosen dynamic wind interaction model, both X-ray luminosity and radial
X-ray brightness profile are determined by three key parameters, namely the
so-called X-ray parameter $X$, two radii $R_{rs}$ and $R_c$ of the reverse
shock and the contact discontinuity. We find that morphologies of X-ray
emissions would appear in the forms of either a central luminous sphere or a
bright ring embedded within optically bright shells. In contrast to previous
adiabatic models, the X-ray brightness peaks around the reverse shock, instead
of the contact discontinuity surface just inside the outer shocked dense shell.
Diffuse X-ray emissions of a few observed PNe appear to support this wind-wind
dynamic interaction scenario.

thermodynamics, the validity conditions of GSL on event horizon are presented.
Also without use first law, if we impose the entropy relation on the horizon,
then we also obtain the condition of validity of GSL on event horizon. The
validity of GSL completely depends on the model of BD scalar field solutions.
We have justified that on the apparent horizon the two process are equivalent,
but on the event horizon they are not equivalent. If first law is valid on the
event horizon then GSL may be satisfied in BD solution, but if first law is not
satisfied then GSL is not satisfied in BD solution. So first law always favours
GSL on event horizon. In our effective approach, the first law and GSL is
always satisfied in apparent horizon, which do not depend on BD theory of

consumer-resource system with annual character of the behavior. Namely,
individuals are active during seasons of fixed length separated by winter
periods. All individuals die at the end of the season and the size of the next
generation is determined by the number of offspring produced during the past
season. The rate at which the consumers produce immature offspring depends on
their internal energy which can be increased by feeding. The reproduction of
the resource simply occurs at a constant rate. At the beginning, we consider a
population of consumers maximizing their common fitness, all consumers being
individuals having the same goal function and acting for the common good. We
suppose that a small fraction of the consumer population may appear at the
beginning of one season and start to behave as mutants in the main population.

resource. The individuals in the population choose a strategy that defines how
they use their available time over the course of their life for feeding, for
reproducing (say laying eggs), or split their energy in between these two
activities. We here suppose that their life lasts a full season, so that the
chosen strategy results in the production of a certain number of eggs laid over
the season. This number then helps define the long-run evolution of the
population since the eggs constitute the basis for the population for the next
season. However, in this paper, we strictly concentrate on what occurs within a
season, by considering two possible strategies: the collective optimum and the
uninvadable strategy. The (collective) optimal strategy involves a singular
arc, which has some resource saving feature and may, on the long-term, lead to
an equilibrium. However, it is susceptible to invasion by a greedy mutant which
free-rides on this resource saving strategy. Therefore, the ""optimal"" strategy
is not evolutionarily stable. We thus look for an evolutionarily stable
strategy, using the first ESS condition (""Nash-Wardrop condition""). This yields
a different singular arc and a strategy that conserves less the resource.
Unfortunately, we show in a forthcoming paper that, though it is an ESS, it is
not long-term (interseasonal) sustainable. This is an instance of the classical
""tragedy of the commons"". In this paper we also investigate whether the mixed
strategy on the singular arcs may be interpreted in terms of population shares
using pure strategies. The answer is negative.

based quantum computation (MBQC). They are also used for many quantum protocols
(error correction, secret sharing, etc.). The main focus of this paper is to
provide a structural characterisation of the graph states that can be used for
quantum information processing. The existence of a gflow (generalized flow) is
known to be a requirement for open graphs (graph, input set and output set) to
perform uniformly and strongly deterministic computations. We weaken the gflow
conditions to define two new more general kinds of MBQC: uniform
equiprobability and constant probability. These classes can be useful from a
cryptographic and information point of view because even though we cannot do a
deterministic computation in general we can preserve the information and
transfer it perfectly from the inputs to the outputs. We derive simple graph
characterisations for these classes and prove that the deterministic and
uniform equiprobability classes collapse when the cardinalities of inputs and
outputs are the same. We also prove the reversibility of gflow in that case.
The new graphical characterisations allow us to go from open graphs to graphs
in general and to consider this question: given a graph with no inputs or
outputs fixed, which vertices can be chosen as input and output for quantum
information processing? We present a characterisation of the sets of possible
inputs and ouputs for the equiprobability class, which is also valid for
deterministic computations with inputs and ouputs of the same cardinality.

simulations we show that by introducing additional couplings at $(mN_c+1)$-th
oscillators in the ring, where $m$ is an integer and $N_c$ is the maximum
number of synchronized oscillators in the ring with a single coupling, the
maximum number of oscillators that can be synchronized can be increased
considerably beyond the limit restricted by size instability. We also
demonstrate that there exists an exponential relation between the number of
oscillators that can support stable synchronization in the ring with the
external drive and the critical coupling strength $\epsilon_c$ with a scaling
exponent $\gamma$. The critical coupling strength is calculated by numerically
estimating the synchronization error and is also confirmed from the conditional
Lyapunov exponents (CLEs) of the coupled systems. We find that the same scaling
relation exists for $m$ couplings between the drive and the ring. Further, we
have examined the robustness of the synchronous states against Gaussian white
noise and found that the synchronization error exhibits a power-law decay as a
function of the noise intensity indicating the existence of both noise-enhanced
and noise-induced synchronizations depending on the value of the coupling
strength $\epsilon$. In addition, we have found that $\epsilon_c$ shows an
exponential decay as a function of the number of additional couplings. These
results are demonstrated using the paradigmatic models of R\""ossler and Lorenz

viable alternative between the two extreme ones based on global and partitioned

cannot be assigned to any individual processor, while most tasks are assigned
to specific processors, considerably reduces the runtime overhead compared to
global scheduling on the one hand, and improve both the schedulability and the

In this paper, we address the preemptive scheduling problem of hard real-time
systems composed of sporadic constrained-deadline tasks upon identical

based on the concept of semi-partitioned scheduling with restricted migrations
in which jobs are not allowed to migrate, but two subsequent jobs of a task can
be assigned to different processors by following a periodic strategy.

devised to simulate the dynamics of 1D quantum systems, to simulate the
time-evolution of non-equilibrium stochastic systems. We describe this method
in detail; a system's probability distribution is represented by a matrix
product state (MPS) of finite dimension and then its time-evolution is
efficiently simulated by repeatedly updating and approximately re-factorizing
this representation. We examine the use of MPS as an approximation method,
looking at parallels between the interpretations of applying it to quantum
state vectors and probability distributions. In the context of stochastic
systems we consider two types of factorization for use in the TEBD algorithm:
non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), which ensures that the approximate
probability distribution is manifestly non-negative, and the singular value
decomposition (SVD). Comparing these factorizations we find the accuracy of the
SVD to be substantially greater than current NMF algorithms. We then apply TEBD
to simulate the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) for systems
of up to hundreds of lattice sites in size. Using exact analytic results for
the TASEP steady state, we find that TEBD reproduces this state such that the
error in calculating expectation values can be made negligible, even when
severely compressing the description of the system by restricting the dimension
of the MPS to be very small. Out of the steady state we show for specific
observables that expectation values converge as the dimension of the MPS is
increased to a moderate size.

higher dimensional superstring theory and considering these as underlying
structures for the theory. First, we explore connections of exotic smoothings
of R^4 and certain configurations of NS and D-branes, both classical and
(generalized) quantum using C* algebras. Effects of some small exotic R^4's,
when localized on S^3, correspond to stringy geometries of B-fields on S^3.
Exotic smoothness of R^4 acts as a non-vanishing B-field on S^3. The dynamics
of D-branes in SU(2) WZW model at finite k indicates the exoticness of ambient
R^4. Next, based on the relation of exotic smooth R^4 with integral levels of
SU(2) WZW model we show the correspondence between exotic smoothness on
4-space, transversal to the world volume of NS5 branes, and the number of these
NS5 branes. Relation with the calculations in holographically dual
6-dimensional little string theory is discussed. Generalized quantum D-branes
in the noncommutative C* algebras corresponding to the codimension-1 foliations
of S^3 are considered and these determine the KK invariants of exotic smooth
R_h^4 for the case of non-integral $[h]\in H^3(S^3,R)$. Moreover, exotic smooth
R^4's embedded in some exotic R^4 as open submanifolds, are shown to correspond
to generalized quantum D-branes in the noncommutative C* algebra of the
foliation. Finally, we show how exotic smoothness of R^4 is correlated with D6
brane charges in IIA string theory. In the last section we construct wild
embeddings of spheres and relate them to D-brane charges as well to KK theory.
We conjecture that a quantum D-brane is wild embedding. Then we construct an
action for a quantum D-brane and show that the classical limit (the usual
embedding) agrees with the Born-Infeld action.

best studied experimentally, which until very recently have lacked theoretical
explanations. This review discusses the construction of a theory and the
analysis of phenomena occurring in strongly correlated Fermi systems such as
heavy-fermion (HF) metals and two-dimensional (2D) Fermi systems. It is shown
that the basic properties and the scaling behavior of HF metals can be
described within the framework of a fermion condensation quantum phase
transition (FCQPT) and extended quasiparticle paradigm that allow us to explain
the non-Fermi liquid behavior observed in strongly correlated Fermi systems. In
contrast to the Landau paradigm stating that the quasiparticle effective mass
is a constant, the effective mass of new quasiparticles strongly depends on
temperature, magnetic field, pressure, and other parameters. Having analyzed
collected facts on strongly correlated Fermi systems with quite different
microscopic nature, we find these to exhibit the same non-Fermi liquid behavior
at FCQPT. We show both analytically and using arguments based entirely on the
experimental grounds that the data collected on very different strongly
correlated Fermi systems have a universal scaling behavior, and materials with
strongly correlated fermions can unexpectedly be uniform in their diversity.
Our analysis of strongly correlated systems such as HF metals and 2D Fermi
systems is in the context of salient experimental results. Our calculations of
the non-Fermi liquid behavior, the scales and thermodynamic, relaxation and
transport properties are in good agreement with experimental facts.

long-tailed waiting time distributions. Over the last years various authors
have shown that extensions of such CTRW models incorporating reactive processes
to the mesoscopic transport equations may lead to non-intuitive
reaction-subdiffusion equations. In particular, one such equation has been
recently derived for a subdiffusive random walker subject to a linear
(first-order) death process. We take this equation as a starting point to study
the developmental biology key problem of morphogen gradient formation, both for
the uniform case where the morphogen degradation rate coefficient (reactivity)
is constant and for the non-uniform case (position-dependent reactivity). In
the uniform case we obtain exponentially decreasing stationary concentration
profiles and we study their robustness with respect to perturbations in the
incoming morphogen flux. In the non-uniform case we find a rich phenomenology
at the level of the stationary profiles. We conclude that the analytic form of
the long-time morphogen concentration profiles is very sensitive to the spatial
dependence of the reactivity and the specific value of the anomalous diffusion
coefficient.

that (PC) fails for $2$-paving projections with constant diagonal $1/2$. But
the proofs of this fact are existence proofs. We will use variations of the
discrete Fourier Transform matrices to construct concrete examples of these

$r$-pavable in a very strong sense.
  In 1989, Bourgain and Tzafriri showed that the class of zero diagonal

$n$-dimensional Hilbert space) are
  {\em pavable}. It has always been assumed that this result also holds for the
BT-Conjecture - although no one formally checked it. We will show that this is
not the case. We will show that if the BT-Conjecture is true for vectors with
small coefficients (on the order of $\le C/\sqrt{n}$) then the BT-Conjecture is
true and hence KS and PC are true.

rays. The gamma-ray flux is modulated on the orbital period and the TeV
lightcurve shaped by photon-photon annihilation. The observed very-high energy
modulation can be reproduced with a simple leptonic model but fails to explain
the flux detected by HESS at superior conjunction, where gamma rays are fully
absorbed. The contribution from an electron-positron pair cascade could be
strong and prevail over the primary flux at superior conjunction. The created
pairs can be isotropized by the magnetic field, resulting in a
three-dimensional cascade. The aim of this article is to investigate the gamma
ray radiation from this pair cascade in LS 5039. This additional component
could account for HESS observations at superior conjunction in the system. A
semi-analytical and a Monte Carlo method for computing three-dimensional
cascade radiation are presented and applied in the context of binaries.
Three-dimensional cascade radiation contributes significantly at every orbital
phase in the TeV lightcurve, and dominates close to superior conjunction. The
amplitude of the gamma-ray modulation is correctly reproduced for an
inclination of the orbit of about 40 degrees. Primary pairs should be injected
close to the compact object location, otherwise the shape of the modulation is
not explained. In addition, synchrotron emission from the cascade in X-rays
constrains the ambient magnetic field to below 10 G. The radiation from a
three-dimensional pair cascade can account for the TeV flux detected by HESS at
superior conjunction in LS 5039, but the very-high energy spectrum at low
fluxes remains difficult to explain in this model.

emission from the interaction zone of the SS433 microquasar and W50 supernova

fortuitous viewing angle. The Honeycomb nebula is more extended in soft X-ray
emission and could in fact be a small part of the edge of a giant LMC shell
revealed for the first time in this short wavelength domain. It is also
suggested that a previously unnoticed region of optical emission may in fact be
an extension of the Honeycomb around the edge of this giant shell. A secondary
supernova explosion in the edge of a giant shell is considered for the creation
of the Honeycomb nebula. A microquasar origin of the Honeycomb nebula as

telescopes. The bulk of the current star formation activity is hidden from
optical view by dust extinction, but is seen in the near- and mid-IR to the
north of the nucleus. This region is being fed by inflow of gas through the bar
of M83, traced by the prominent dust lane entering into the circumnuclear
region from the north. An analysis of stellar ages confirms that the youngest
stars are indeed in the northwest. A gradual age gradient, with older stars
further to the south, characterises the well-known star-forming arc in the
central region of M83. Detailed analyses of the Pa beta ionised gas kinematics
and near-IR imaging confirm that the kinematic centre coincides with the
photometric centre of M83, and that these are offset significantly, by about 3
arcsec or 60 pc, from the visible nucleus of the galaxy. We discuss two
possible options, the first of which postulates that the kinematic and
photometric centre traces a galaxy nucleus hidden by a substantial amount of
dust extinction, in the range A_V=3-10 mag. By combining this information with
kinematic results and using arguments from the literature, we conclude that
such a scenario is, however, unlikely, as is the existence of other ""hidden""
nuclei in M83. We thus concur with recent authors and favour a second option,
in which the nucleus of the galaxy is offset from its kinematic and photometric
centre. This is presumably a result of some past interaction, possibly related
to the event which lies at the origin of the disturbance of the outer disk of
the galaxy. (Abridged)

in the case of partial occlusion of the object(s) of interest, background

present paper introduces a novel approach segmentation through the use of
""weak"" shape priors. Specifically, in the proposed method, an segmenting active
contour is constrained to converge to a configuration at which its geometric
parameters attain their empirical probability densities closely matching the
corresponding model densities that are learned based on training samples. It is
shown through numerical experiments that the proposed shape modeling can be
regarded as ""weak"" in the sense that it minimally influences the segmentation,
which is allowed to be dominated by data-related forces. On the other hand, the
priors provide sufficient constraints to regularize the convergence of
segmentation, while requiring substantially smaller training sets to yield less

main advantages of the proposed technique over some existing alternatives is

particularly interesting because its radial position varies systematically with
longitude relative to the Sun in such a way that the ringlet's geometric center
appears to be displaced away from Saturn's center in a direction roughly toward
the Sun. In other words, the ringlet is always found at greater distances from
the planet's center at longitudes near the sub-solar longitude than it is at
longitudes near Saturn's shadow. This ""heliotropic"" behavior indicates that the
dynamics of the particles in this ring are being influenced by solar radiation
pressure. In order to investigate this phenomenon, which has been predicted
theoretically but has never been observed this clearly, we analyze multiple
image sequences of this ringlet obtained by Cassini in order to constrain its
shape and orientation. These data can be fit reasonably well with a model in
which both the eccentricity and the inclination of the ringlet have ""forced""
components (that maintain a fixed orientation relative to the Sun) as well as
""free"" components (that drift around the planet at steady rates determined by
Saturn's oblateness). While the magnitude of the forced eccentricity is roughly
consistent with theoretical expectations for radiation pressure acting on
10-to-100-micron-wide icy grains, the existence of significant free
eccentricities and inclinations poses a significant challenge for models of
low-optical-depth dusty rings.

We have
resolved the system in a Chandra X-ray observation and detected only the
primary, FU Tau A. Hard X-ray emission, presumably from a corona, is present
but, unexpectedly, we detect also a strong and unusually soft component from FU
Tau A. Its X-ray properties, so far unique among brown dwarfs, are very similar
to those of the T Tauri star TW Hya. The analogy with TW Hya suggests that the
dominating soft X-ray component can be explained by emission from accretion
shocks. However, the typical free-fall velocities of a brown dwarf are too low
for an interpretation of the observed X-ray temperature as post-shock region.
On the other hand, velocities in excess of the free-fall speed are derived from
archival optical spectroscopy, and independent pieces of evidence for strong
accretion in FU Tau A are found in optical photometry. The high X-ray
luminosity of FU Tau A coincides with a high bolometric luminosity confirming
an unexplained trend among young brown dwarfs. In fact, FU Tau A is
overluminous with respect to evolutionary models while FU Tau B is on the 1 Myr
isochrone suggesting non-contemporaneous formation of the two components in the
binary. The extreme youth of FU Tau A could be responsible for its peculiar
X-ray properties, in terms of atypical magnetic activity or accretion.
Alternatively, rotation and magnetic field effects may reduce the efficiency of
convection which in turn affects the effective temperature and radius of FU Tau
A shifting its position in the HR diagram. Although there is no direct prove of
this latter scenario so far we present arguments for its plausibility.

properties of simple C*-algebras and their interplay. In particular, a simple
C*-algebra is defined to be (tracially) (m,\bar{m})-pure, if it has (strong
tracial) m-comparison and is (tracially) \bar{m}-almost divisible. These
notions are related to each other, and to nuclear dimension. The main result
says that if a separable, simple, nonelementary, unital C*-algebra A with
locally finite nuclear dimension is (m,\bar{m})-pure, then it absorbs the
Jiang-Su algebra Z tensorially. It follows that A is Z-stable if and only if it
has the Cuntz semigroup of a Z-stable C*-algebra. The result may be regarded as
a version of Kirchberg's celebrated theorem that separable, simple, nuclear,
purely infinite C*-algebras absorb the Cuntz algebra O_\infty tensorially. As a
corollary we obtain that finite nuclear dimension implies Z-stability for
separable, simple, nonelementary, unital C*-algebras; this settles an important
case of a conjecture by Toms and the author. The main result also has a number
of consequences for Elliott's program to classify nuclear C*-algebras by their
K-theory data. In particular, it completes the classification of simple,
unital, approximately homogeneous algebras with slow dimension growth by their
Elliott invariants, a question left open in the Elliott-Gong-Li classification
of simple AH algebras. Another consequence is that for simple, unital,
approximately subhomogeneous algebras, slow dimension growth and Z-stability
are equivalent. In the case where projections separate traces, this completes
the classification of simple, unital, approximately subhomogeneous algebras
with slow dimension growth by their ordered K-groups.

be used in combination with most clustering algorithms. The PKNNG metric is
based on a two-step procedure: first it constructs the k-Nearest-Neighbor-Graph
of the dataset of interest using a low k-value and then it adds edges with an
exponentially penalized weight for connecting the sub-graphs produced by the
first step. We discuss several possible schemes for connecting the different
sub-graphs. We use three artificial datasets in four different embedding
situations to evaluate the behavior of the new metric, including a comparison
among different clustering methods. We also evaluate the new metric in a real
world application, clustering the MNIST digits dataset. In all cases the PKNNG
metric shows promising clustering results.

the importance of the choice of the reference frame, the interplay between

experimental acceptance on the comparison between experimental measurements and
theoretical calculations. Given the puzzles raised by the available
experimental results, new measurements must provide more detailed information,
such that physical conclusions can be derived without relying on
model-dependent assumptions. We describe a frame-invariant formalism which
minimizes the dependence of the measurements on the experimental acceptance,
facilitates the comparison with theoretical calculations, and probes systematic
effects due to experimental biases. This formalism is a direct and generic
consequence of the rotational invariance of the dilepton decay distribution and
is independent of any assumptions specific to particular models of quarkonium
production. The use of this improved approach, which exploits the intrinsic
multidimensionality of the problem, will significantly contribute to a faster
progress in our understanding of quarkonium production, especially if adopted
as a common analysis framework by the LHC experiments, which will soon perform
analyses of quarkonium polarization in proton-proton collisions.

fraction (20/90) of the galaxies observed. The radio luminosities of these
cores (~10^21 W/Hz) are too large to be explained by radio supernovae or
supernova remnants and we argue that they are instead powered by AGN. These
sub-parsec scale radio cores are preferentially detected toward galaxies whose
VLA maps show bright 100-500 parsec scale nuclear radio components. Since these
latter structures tightly follow the FIR to radio-continuum correlation for
star-formation we conclude that the AGN powered VLBI sources are associated
with compact nuclear starburst environments. The implications for possible
starburst-AGN connections are discussed. The detected VLBI sources have a
relatively narrow range of radio luminosity consistent with models in which
intense compact Eddington-limited starbursts regulate the gas supply onto a
central super-massive black hole. The high incidence of AGN radio cores in
compact starbursts suggests little or no delay between the starburst phase and

  $sp(\infty)$-modules",,,,,"math.RT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We investigate several categories of integrable $sl(\infty)$-, $o(\infty)$-,
$sp(\infty)$-modules. In particular, we prove that the category of integrable
$sl(\infty)$-, $o(\infty)$-, $sp(\infty)$-modules with finite-dimensional
weight spaces is semisimple. The most interesting category we study is the
category $\widetilde{\mathrm{Tens}}_{\mathfrak{g}}$ of tensor modules. Its
objects $M$ are defined as integrable modules of finite Loewy length such that
the algebraic dual $M^*$ is also integrable and of finite Loewy length.
  We prove that the simple objects of
$\widetilde{\mathrm{Tens}}_{\mathfrak{g}}$ are precisely the simple tensor
modules, i.e. the simple subquotients of the tensor algebra of the direct sum
of the natural and conatural representations.
  We also study injectives in $\widetilde{\mathrm{Tens}}_{\mathfrak{g}}$ and
compute the Ext$^1$'s between simple modules. Finally, we characterize a
certain subcategory $\mathrm{Tens}_{\mathfrak{g}}$ of
$\widetilde{\mathrm{Tens}}_{\mathfrak{g}}$ as the unique minimal abelian full
subcategory of the category of integrable modules which contains a non-trivial
module and is closed under tensor product and algebraic dualization.

"1006.2994","Elem\'er Rosinger","Elemer E. Rosinger","Two Theories of Special Relativity ?",,,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, [3], it was shown that Special Relativity is in fact based on one
single physical axiom which is that of Reciprocity. Originally, Einstein, [1],
established Special Relativity on two physical axioms, namely, the Galilean
Relativity and the Constancy of the Speed of Light in inertial reference
frames. Soon after, [4,5], it was shown that the Galilean Relativity alone is
sufficient for Special Relativity. Here it is important to note that,
implicitly, three more assumptions have been used on space-time coordinate
transformations, namely, the homogeneity of space-time, the isotropy of space,
and a mathematical condition of smoothness type. In [3], a boundedness
condition on space-time coordinate transformations is used instead of a usual
mathematical smoothness type condition. In this paper it is shown that the
respective boundedness condition is closely related to a Principle of
Transformation Increment Ratio Limitation, or in short, PTIRL, which has an
obvious physical meaning. It is also shown that PTIRL is {\it not} a stronger
assumption than that of the mentioned boundedness in [3]. Of interest is the
fact that, by formulating PTIRL as a physical axiom, the possibility is opened
up for the acceptance, or on the contrary, rejection of this physical axiom
PTIRL, thus leading to {\it two} possible theories of Special Relativity. And
to add further likelihood to such a possibility, the rejection of PTIRL leads
easily to effects which involve unlimited time and/or space intervals, thus are
not accessible to usual experimentation for the verification of their validity,
or otherwise.

static quality criteria as a variable mutator convention and architectural
layering rules. We successfully developed aspects for automating the following
dynamic quality criteria: Parameterized Exception Chaining, Comfortable
Declaration of Parameterized Exceptions, Not-Null Checking of Reference
Variables.
