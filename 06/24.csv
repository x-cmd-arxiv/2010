to probe the validity of Newton's law in the low acceleration regimes without
the complication of non-baryonic dark matter. Indeed, in contrast with what
happens when studying galaxies, in globular clusters a systematic deviation of
the velocity dispersion profile from the expected Keplerian falloff would
provide indication of a breakdown of Newtonian dynamics rather than the
existence of dark matter. We perform a detailed analysis of the velocity
dispersion in the globular cluster omega Centauri in order to investigate
whether it does decrease monotonically with distance as recently claimed by
Sollima et al. (2009), or whether it converges toward a constant value as
claimed by Scarpa Marconi and Gilmozzi (2003B). We combine measurements from
these two works to almost double the data available at large radii, in this way
obtaining an improved determination of the velocity dispersion profile in the
low acceleration regime. We found the inner region of omega Centauri is clearly
rotating, while the rotational velocity tend to vanish, and is consistent with
no rotation at all, in the external regions. The cluster velocity dispersion at
large radii from the center is found to be sensibly constant. The main
conclusion of this work is that strong similarities are emerging between
globular clusters and elliptical galaxies, for in both classes of objects the
velocity dispersion tends to remain constant at large radii. In the case of
galaxies, this is ascribed to the presence of a massive halo of dark matter,
something physically unlikely in the case of globular clusters. Such
similarity, if confirmed, is best explained by a breakdown of Newtonian
dynamics below a critical acceleration.

CRisp Imaging SpectroPolarimeter at the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope to analyze
the velocity profile of granular light bridges in a sunspot. We find upflows
associated with the central dark lanes of the light bridges. From bisectors in
the Fe I 630.15 nm line we find that the magnitude of the upflows varies with
height with the strongest upflows being deeper in the atmosphere. Typical
upflow velocities measured from the 70% bisector are around 500 m/s with peaks
above 1 km/s. The upflows in the central dark lane are surrounded by downflows
of weaker magnitude, sometimes concentrated in patches with enhanced velocities
reaching up to 1.1 km/s. A small spatial offset between the upflows and the
continuum dark lane is interpreted as a line-of-sight effect due to the
elevated nature of the dark lane and the light bridge above the umbral
surroundings. Our observations show that the central dark lane in granular
light bridges is not equivalent to the intergranular lanes of normal
photospheric granulation that host convective downflows. These results support
recent MHD simulations of magneto-convection in sunspot atmospheres.

the preservation of information on structures whose degenerate ground state
encodes a classical redundancy code. Controlled-not gates are used to transform
the stabilizer Hamiltonian into a Hamiltonian consisting of uncoupled single

analytical partition function and derive closed form equations for the relative
magnetization and susceptibility. These equations are in agreement with the
numerical results presented in [arXiv:0907.0394v1] for finite size systems.
Analytical solutions show that there is no finite critical temperature, Tc=0,
for all of the memory structures in the thermodynamic limit. This is in
contrast to the previously predicted finite critical temperatures based on
extrapolation. The mismatch is a result of the infinite system being a poor
approximation even for astronomically large finite size systems, where
spontaneous magnetization still arises below an apparent finite critical
temperature. We extend our analysis to the canonical stabilizer Hamiltonian.
Interestingly, Hamiltonians with two-body interactions have a higher apparent
critical temperature than the many-body Hamiltonian.

e-capture SNe are characterized by lower resultant gravitational masses and
smaller natal kicks, leading to lower orbital eccentricities when the e-capture
SN has led to the formation of the second neutron star in a binary system.
Based on the measured masses and eccentricities, we identify four neutron
stars, which have a mean post-collapse gravitational mass of ~1.25 solar
masses, as the product of e-capture SNe. We associate the remaining ten neutron
stars, which have a mean mass of 1.35 solar masses, with Fe-core collapse SNe.
If the e-capture supernova occurs during the formation of the first neutron

double neutron stars, given that more systems will remain bound with the
smaller kicks. However, this does not appear to be the case for any of the
observed systems, and we discuss possible reasons for this.

a consequence of the fact that Maxwell's equations are incomplete because they
lack a way to define local inertial reference frames. This new theory
explicitly defines 3-dimensional local inertial reference frames in terms of

paper, Moarref & Jovanovi\'c (2010). We use direct numerical simulations of the
Navier-Stokes equations to assess the efficacy of blowing and suction in the
form of streamwise traveling waves for controlling the onset of turbulence in a
channel flow. We highlight the effects of the modified base flow on the
dynamics of velocity fluctuations and net power balance. Our simulations verify
the theoretical predictions of Part 1 that the upstream traveling waves promote
turbulence even when the uncontrolled flow stays laminar. On the other hand,
the downstream traveling waves with parameters selected in Part 1 are capable
of reducing the fluctuations' kinetic energy, thereby maintaining the laminar
flow. In flows driven by a fixed pressure gradient, a positive net efficiency
as large as 25 % relative to the uncontrolled turbulent flow can be achieved
with downstream waves. Furthermore, we show that these waves can also
relaminarize fully developed turbulent flows at low Reynolds numbers. We
conclude that the theory developed in Part 1 for the linearized flow equations
with uncertainty has considerable ability to predict full-scale phenomena.

our SN rates. This is the largest and most homogeneous set of nearby SNe ever

on CCD imaging and modern image-subtraction techniques. In this paper, we lay
the foundation of the study. We derive the recipe for the control-time

the construction of the galaxy and SN samples used in the calculations.
Compared with a complete volume-limited galaxy sample, our sample has a deficit
of low-luminosity galaxies but still provides enough statistics for a reliable
rate calculation. There is a strong Malmquist bias, so the average size
(luminosity or mass) of the galaxies increases monotonically with distance, and
this trend is used to showcase a correlation between SN rates and galaxy sizes.
Very few core-collapse SNe are found in early-type galaxies, providing strong
constraints on the amount of recent star formation within these galaxies. The
small average observation interval ($\sim 9$ days) of our survey ensures that
our control-time calculations can tolerate a reasonable amount of uncertainty
in the luminosity functions of SNe. We perform Monte Carlo simulations to

luminosity distribution of SNe and the host-galaxy extinction. We select a
volume-limited sample of 175 SNe, collect photometry for every object, and fit
a family of light curves to constrain the peak magnitudes and light-curve
shapes. The volume-limited LFs show that they are not well represented by a

shows that they are consistent with each other to within uncertainties when the
rate calculations are done in the same manner. Nevertheless, our data
demonstrate that the rates cannot be adequately described by a single parameter
using either galaxy Hubble types or B - K colours. A secondary parameter in
galaxy ""size"", expressed by luminosity or stellar mass, is needed to adequately
describe the rates in the rate-size relation: the galaxies of smaller sizes
have higher SN rates per unit mass or per unit luminosity. The trends of the SN
rates in galaxies of different Hubble types and colours are discussed. We
examine possible causes for the rate-size relation. Physically, such a relation

leaves localized features in the spectrum and bispectrum of the observable
cosmological fluctuations, via the Infra-Red (IR) cascading mechanism. We focus
on a simple prototype interaction g^2 (\phi-\phi_0)^2\chi^2 between the
inflaton, \phi, and iso-inflaton, \chi; extending previous work on this model
in two directions. First, we quantify the magnitude of the produced
nongaussianity by extracting the moments of the probability distribution
function from lattice field theory simulations. We argue that the bispectrum
feature from particle production might be observable for reasonable values of
the coupling, g^2. Second, we develop a detailed analytical theory of particle
production and IR cascading during inflation, which is in excellent agreement
with numerical simulations. Our formalism improves significantly on previous
approaches by consistently incorporating both the expansion of the universe and
also metric perturbations. We use this new formalism to estimate the shape of
the bispectrum from particle production, showing this to be distinguishable
from other mechanisms that predict large nongaussianity.

develops from the lower atmosphere during the observations. The apparent ascent
speed of the column is 2 km s$^{-1}$, while the fine structures of the column
exhibit much faster motion of up to 20 km s$^{-1}$. The column eventually
becomes a faint low-lying prominence. Associated with the appearance of the
column, an overlying coronal cavity seen in the X-ray and EUV moves upward at

suggest that they are due to the emergence of a helical flux rope that
undergoes reconnection with lower coronal fields, possibly carrying material
into the coronal cavity. Under the assumption of the emerging flux scenario,
the lower velocity of 2 km s$^{-1}$ and the higher one of 20 km s$^{-1}$ in the
column are attributed to the rising motion of the emerging flux and to the
outflow driven by magnetic reconnection between the emerging flux and the
pre-existing coronal field, respectively. The present paper gives a coherent
explanation of the enigmatic phenomenon of the rising column with the emergence

the non-monotonic behavior of many fluctuation observables as a function of the
collision energy. The event-by-event fluctuations of various particle
multiplicities are enhanced in those collisions that freeze out near the
critical point. Higher, non-Gaussian, moments of the event-by-event
distributions of such observables are particularly sensitive to critical
fluctuations, since their magnitude depends on the critical correlation length
to a high power. We present quantitative estimates of the contribution of
critical fluctuations to the third and fourth moments of the pion, proton and
net proton multiplicities, as well as estimates of various measures of
pion-proton correlations, all as a function of the same five non-universal
parameters, one of which is the correlation length that parametrizes proximity
to the critical point. We show how to use nontrivial but parameter independent
ratios among these more than a dozen fluctuation observables to discover the
critical point. We also construct ratios that, if the critical point is found,
can be used to overconstrain the values of the non-universal parameters.

star formation history and geometrical arrangement of stars and gas in
galaxies. The computation of the radiative transfer of stellar radiation
through the dust distribution is time-consuming. This aspect becomes
unacceptable in particular when dealing with the predictions by semi-analytical
galaxy formation models populating cosmological volumes, to be then compared
with multi-wavelength surveys. Mainly for this aim, we have implemented an
artificial neural network algorithm into the spectro-photometric and radiative
transfer code GRASIL in order to compute the spectral energy distribution of
galaxies in a short computing time. This allows to avoid the adoption of
empirical templates that may have nothing to do with the mock galaxies output
by models. The ANN has been implemented to compute the dust emission spectrum
(the bottleneck of the computation), and separately for the star-forming
molecular clouds and the diffuse dust (due to their different properties and
dependencies). We have defined the input neurons effectively determining their
emission, which means this implementation has a general applicability and is
not linked to a particular galaxy formation model. We have trained the net for
the disc and spherical geometries, and tested its performance to reproduce the
SED of disc and starburst galaxies, as well as for a semi-analytical model for
spheroidal galaxies. We have checked that for this model both the SEDs and the
galaxy counts in the Herschel bands obtained with the ANN approximation are
almost superimposed to the same quantities obtained with the full GRASIL. We
conclude that this method appears robust and advantageous, and will present the
application to a more complex SAM in another paper.

cause local variations in the universal expansion rate and directional
dependences in the redshift-distance relation. We present a scheme for relating
a power spectrum of dark energy fluctuations to an angular covariance function

The observational result is consistent with zero dark energy fluctuations.

quite general dark energy fluctuations as long as they are in the linear

century interested in finding out if the speed of gravity is infinite. By
analogy with electrodynamics, some retarded potentials replacing Newtonian were
utilized. By using one of such potentials Gerber correctly calculated the
perihelion shift for Mercury in 1902. Subsequent attempts at calculation of
bending of light using Gerber-style calculations were not successful. Recently
Gin\'e (Chaos, Solitons and Fractals 42, 1893 (2009)) reobtained both the

delay-type. When applied to two-body dynamics, such equations lead to orbital
quantization. In this work the Einsteinian approach is used to reproduce this
quantization. Numerous arguments justifying the superiority of Einsteinian
approach, including uses of the Bertrand spacetimes for description of motion
of stars around galactic centers are provided. The developed formalism is

varying quadratic stiff potentials that uses coarse timesteps (analogous to
what the impulse method uses for constant quadratic stiff potentials). This
method is based on the highly-non-trivial introduction of two efficient
symplectic schemes for exponentiations of matrices that only require O(n)
matrix multiplications operations at each coarse time step for a preset small
number n. The proposed integrator is shown to be (i) uniformly convergent on
positions; (ii) symplectic in both slow and fast variables; (iii) well adapted
to high dimensional systems. Our framework also provides a general method for
iteratively exponentiating a slowly varying sequence of (possibly high
dimensional) matrices in an efficient way.

For the examples we demonstrate, knowledge of this structure allows the
Euler-Lagrange equations to be integrated with relative ease. Our methods take
advantage of recent advances in the theory of moving frames by Fels and Olver,

enhancement of remnant polarization at MPB as shown by the ferroelectric

increases with increasing BF content. Significant magnetization of the samples
indicates melting of spin spirals in the BF-xPT arising from random

was corroborated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements. The results

exhibits strong flapping motions in the plane perpendicular to the arm. The
overall flow structure at saturation is comprised of arm, postshock expansion

transitions from rarefied to dense phases at the shock and from dense to

forming dense condensations. If self-gravity is omitted, the shock flapping

equals the advection velocity) in the context of core collapse supernovae
during the phase of accretion on the proto-neutron star. Such a surface should
exist even for weak magnetic fields because the advection velocity decreases to
zero at the center of the collapsing core. In this decelerated flow, Alfven
waves created by the standing accretion shock instability (SASI) or convection
accumulate and amplify while approaching the Alfven surface. We study this
amplification using one dimensional MHD simulations with explicit physical
dissipation. In the linear regime, the amplification continues until the Alfven
wavelength becomes as small as the dissipative scale. A pressure feedback that
increases the pressure in the upstream flow is created via a non linear
coupling. We derive analytic formulae for the maximum amplification and the non
linear coupling and check them with numerical simulations to a very good
accuracy. We also characterize the non linear saturation of this amplification
when compression effects become important, leading to either a change of the
velocity gradient, or a steepening of the Alfven wave. Applying these results
to core collapse supernovae shows that the amplification can be fast enough to
affect the dynamics, if the magnetic field is strong enough for the Alfven
surface to lie in the region of strong velocity gradient just above the
neutrinosphere. This requires the presence of a strong magnetic field in the
progenitor star, which would correspond to the formation of a magnetar under
the assumption of magnetic flux conservation. An extrapolation of our analytic
formula (taking into account the nonlinear saturation) suggests that the Alfven
wave could reach an amplitude of B ~ 10^15 G, and that the pressure feedback
could significantly contribute to the pressure below the shock.

their atmosphere. This is particularly true in the case of exoplanets close to
their stars, for which one has to account both for an (often intense)
irradiation flux, and from an intrinsic flux responsible for the progressive
loss of the inner planetary heat. The goals of the present work are to help
understanding the coupling between radiative transfer and advection in
exoplanetary atmospheres and to provide constraints on the temperatures of the
deep atmospheres. This is crucial in assessing whether modifying assumed
opacity sources and/or heat transport may explain the inflated sizes of a
significant number of giant exoplanets found so far. I use a simple analytical
approach inspired by Eddington's approximation for stellar atmospheres to
derive a relation between temperature and optical depth valid for
plane-parallel static grey atmospheres which are both transporting an intrinsic
heat flux and receiving an outer radiation flux. The model is parameterized as
a function of mean visible and thermal opacities, respectively. The model is
shown to reproduce relatively well temperature profiles obtained from more
sophisticated radiative transfer calculations of exoplanetary atmospheres. It
naturally explains why a temperature inversion (stratosphere) appears when the
opacity in the optical becomes significant compared to that in the infrared. I
further show that the mean equivalent flux (proportional to T^4) is conserved
in the presence of horizontal advection on constant optical depth levels. This
implies with these hypotheses that the deep atmospheric temperature used as
outer boundary for the evolution models should be calculated from models
pertaining to the entire planetary atmosphere, not from ones that are relevant
to the day side or to the substellar point. In these conditions, present-day
models yield deep temperatures that are ~1000K too cold to explain the present
size of planet HD 209458b. An tenfold increase in the infrared to visible
opacity ratio would be required to slow the planetary cooling and contraction
sufficiently to explain its size. However, the mean equivalent flux is not
conserved anymore in the presence of opacity variations, or in the case of
non-radiative vertical transport of energy: The presence of clouds on the night
side or a downward transport of kinetic energy and its dissipation at deep
levels would help making the deep atmosphere hotter and may explain the
inflated sizes of giant exoplanets.

spectrum, the quasinormal modes as the characteristic modes of a black hole
have been used in obtaining the horizon area spectrum of the black hole.
However, the area spectrum of the Kerr black hole in some previous works was
inconsistent with the Bekenstein's proposal. In this paper, we notice that the
Kerr black hole has three types of resonance modes which are quasinormal modes
(QNM), total transmission modes (TTM), and total reflection modes (TRM). All of
these resonances represent highly damped oscillations and only depend on the
black hole parameters which are mass, charge and angular momentum of the black
hole. We propose that all of these modes should be used in quantizing the black
hole. With all these modes, we find that both the inner and outer horizon areas
of the Kerr black hole are equally spaced. Similar behavior is also found in
the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole.

Among the many aspects related to that question, dead zones are of particular
importance as they can influence both the formation and the migration of
planetary embryos. The ionisation level in the disc is the key element in
determining the existence and the location of the dead zone. This has been
studied either within the Standard Accretion Disc (SAD) framework or using
parametric discs. In this paper, we extend this study to the case of Jet
Emitting Discs (JED), the structure of which strongly differ from SADs because
of the new energy balance and angular momentum extraction imposed by the jets.
We make use of the (r,z) density distributions provided by self-similar
accretion-ejection models, along with the JED thermal structure derived in a
previous paper, to create maps of the ionisation structure of JEDs. We compare
the ionisation rates we obtain to the critical value required to trigger the
magneto-rotational instability. It is found that JEDs have a much higher
ionisation degree than SADs which renders very unlikely the presence of a dead
zone in these discs. As JEDs are believed to occupy the inner regions of
accretion discs, the extension of the dead zones published in the literature
should be re-considered for systems in which a jet is present. Moreover, since
JEDs require large scale magnetic fields close to equipartition, our findings
raise again the question of magnetic field advection in circumstellar accretion
discs.

re-examination of the Supernova Project results using this new formalism, with
a new estimate of the cosmological parameters; the ordinary matter to dark
matter densities ratio; the existence of a new fundamental constant having the

local (von Neumann) algebras in the vacuum sector associated to double cones
with bases on a fixed space-like hyperplane completely determines an algebraic
QFT model. More precisely, if for two models there is unitary connecting all of
these algebras, then --- without assuming that this unitary also connects their

that the two models are equivalent. This result might be viewed as an algebraic

through the shift of either the G or 2D phonons of graphene. In spite of the
infinitely small thickness of the monolayers, the results show that graphene
embedded in plastic beams exhibit remarkable compression buckling strains. For

order of -0.5% to -0.6%. However, for l/w <0.2 no failure is observed for
strains even higher than -1%. Calculations based on classical Euler analysis

their low noise, light-speed transmission and ease of manipulation using
conventional optical components. However, the lack of highly efficient optical
Kerr nonlinearities at single photon level was a major obstacle. In a
breakthrough, Knill, Laflamme and Milburn (KLM) showed that such an efficient
nonlinearity can be achieved using only linear optical elements, auxiliary
photons, and measurement. They proposed a heralded controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate
for scalable quantum computation using a photonic quantum circuit to combine
two such nonlinear elements. Here we experimentally demonstrate a KLM CNOT
gate. We developed a stable architecture to realize the required four-photon
network of nested multiple interferometers based on a displaced-Sagnac
interferometer and several partially polarizing beamsplitters. This result
confirms the first step in the KLM `recipe' for all-optical quantum
computation, and should be useful for on-demand entanglement generation and

generalized to a class of so-called PT symmetric Hamiltonians and some proofs

by the ODM summation method. The basic idea of the ODM summation method is the
notion of order-dependent ""local"" disk of convergence and analytic continuation
by an order-dependent mapping of the domain of analyticity augmented by the
local disk of convergence onto a circle. In the limit of vanishing local radius
of convergence, which is the limit of high transformation order, convergence is
demonstrated both by numerical evidence as well as by analytic estimates.

study the ISM dynamics and star formation properties. High spatial and mass
resolutions of 12pc and 4x10^4 M_sol allow to resolve cold and turbulent gas
clouds embedded in a warmer diffuse phase. We compare to lower resolution
models, where the multiphase ISM is not resolved and is modeled as a relatively
homogeneous and stable medium. While merger-driven bursts of star formation are
generally attributed to large-scale gas inflows towards the nuclear regions, we
show that once a realistic ISM is resolved, the dominant process is actually
gas fragmentation into massive and dense clouds and rapid star formation
therein. As a consequence, star formation is more efficient by a factor of up
to 10 and is also somewhat more extended, while the gas density probability
distribution function (PDF) rapidly evolves towards very high densities. We
thus propose that the actual mechanism of starburst triggering in galaxy
collisions can only be captured at high spatial resolution and when the cooling
of gas is modeled down to less than 10^3 K. Not only does our model reproduce
the properties of the Antennae system, but it also explains the ``starburst

the cross correlation between hot gas and galaxies of different luminosity to
probe the hot gas in dark matter halos without identifying galaxy groups to
represent dark halos. Our results show that, with a galaxy survey as large as

vacuum is injected into the usually unused input port. It is investigated under
which conditions the gravitational wave signal may be amplified without
increasing counting noise concurrently. Such a possibility was suggested as a
consequence of the entanglement of the two output ports of a beam splitter. We
find that amplification without concurrent increase of noise is not possible
for reasonable squeezing parameters. Photon distributions for various beam
splitter angles and squeezing parameters are calculated.

separate occasions between October-November 2008 and May-July 2009. We have
carried out timing and spectral analysis of the data set, obtaining a complete
state classification of all the observations. We find that all the observations
are well described by using a spectral model consisting of a disk-blackbody, a
powerlaw + reflection + absorption and a gaussian emission component. During
the 2009 outburst the system followed the canonical evolution through all the
states seen in black hole transients. In the 2008 outburst only the hard states
were reached. The early evolution of the spectral parameters is consistent
between the two epochs, and it does not provide clues about the subsequent
behavior of the source. The variation of the flux associated to the two main
spectral components (i.e. disk and powerlaw) allows us to set a lower limit to
the orbital inclination of the system of >= 43{\deg}.

certain circumstances, these describe solutions of discrete evolution equations

evolutions by considering paths with non-commutative weights, together with an
evolution of the weights that reduces to cluster algebra mutations in the

cold gas, strong turbulence, and giant star-forming clumps. Major mergers of
disk galaxies at high redshift should then generally involve such turbulent
clumpy disks. Merger simulations, however, model the ISM as a stable,
homogeneous, and thermally pressurized medium. We present the first merger
simulations with high fractions of cold, turbulent, and clumpy gas. We discuss
the major new features of these models compared to models where the gas is
artificially stabilized and warmed. Gas turbulence, which is already strong in
high-redshift disks, is further enhanced in mergers. Some phases are
dispersion-dominated, with most of the gas kinetic energy in the form of
velocity dispersion and very chaotic velocity fields, unlike merger models
using a thermally stabilized gas. These mergers can reach very high star
formation rates, and have multi-component gas spectra consistent with
SubMillimeter Galaxies. Major mergers with high fractions of cold turbulent gas
are also characterized by highly dissipative gas collapse to the center of
mass, with the stellar component following in a global contraction. The final
galaxies are early-type with relatively small radii and high Sersic indices,
like high-redshift compact spheroids. The mass fraction in a disk component
that survives or re-forms after a merger is severely reduced compared to models
with stabilized gas, and the formation of a massive disk component would
require significant accretion of external baryons afterwards. Mergers thus
appear to destroy extended disks even when the gas fraction is high, and this
lends further support to smooth infall as the main formation mechanism for
massive disk galaxies.

large fermion charges, which correspond to the Fermi liquid regime. The
critical temperature for Fermi liquids is proportinal to the magnetic field and
vanishes as we approach the non-Fermi liquid state. The pairing order parameter
leads to a relative shift of the Fermi surfaces corresponding to the bulk
fermions with spin up and down. The value of the shift in Fermi momentum $k_F$
and the critical temperature $T_c$ are proportional to the effective density of
states at the Fermi surface. Our one-loop calculations provide a dual
description of the magnetic catalysis for the lowest Landau level in graphene.
This analyses may be relevant for the antiferromagnetic behavior in the cuprate
superconductors and for the chiral spirals in the chiral magnetic effect.
  We also discuss thermodynamic and transport properties of a system at the
boundary at zero magnetic field. The scaling behavior of the specific heat is
$c\sim T$ for Fermi liquid and $c\sim T^{2\nu}$ for non-Fermi liquid, while the
behavior of the DC conductivity is the same $\sigma\sim T^{-2\nu}$ in both

analog($S^2_F$) come paired with anticommuting chirality operators. A
consequence of this is seen in the fermion-like spectrum of these operators
which is especially true even for the case of integer-spin Dirac operators.
Motivated by this feature of the spectrum of a spin 1 Dirac operator on
$S_F^2$, we assume the spin 1 particles obey Fermi-Dirac statistics. This
choice is inspite of the lack of a well defined spin-statistics relation on a
compact surface such as $S^2$. The specific heats are computed in the cases of
the spin $\frac{1}{2}$ and spin 1 Dirac operators. Remarkably the specific heat
for a system of spin $\frac{1}{2}$ particles is more than that of the spin 1
case, though the number of degrees of freedom is more in the case of spin 1
particles. The reason for this is inferred through a study of the spectrums of
the Dirac operators in both the cases. The zero modes of the spin 1 Dirac
operator is studied as a function of the cut-off angular momentum $L$ and is
found to follow a simple power law. This number is such that the number of
states with positive energy for the spin 1 and spin $\frac{1}{2}$ system become
comparable. Remarks are made about the spectrums of higher spin Dirac operators
as well through a study of their zero-modes and the variation of their spectrum
with degeneracy. The mean energy as a function of temperature is studied in
both the spin $\frac{1}{2}$ and spin 1 cases. They are found to deviate from
the standard ideal gas law in 2+1 dimensions.

modalities from tense logic Kt. Proof theoretically, this extension is obtained
simply by extending an existing sequent calculus for bi-intuitionistic logic
with typical inference rules for the modalities used in display logics. As it
turns out, the resulting calculus, LBiKt, seems to be more basic than most
intuitionistic tense or modal logics considered in the literature, in
particular, those studied by Ewald and Simpson, as it does not assume any a
priori relationship between the diamond and the box modal operators. We recover
Ewald's intuitionistic tense logic and Simpson's intuitionistic modal logic by
modularly extending LBiKt with additional structural rules. The calculus LBiKt
is formulated in a variant of display calculus, using a form of sequents called
nested sequents. Cut elimination is proved for LBiKt, using a technique similar
to that used in display calculi. As in display calculi, the inference rules of
LBiKt are ``shallow'' rules, in the sense that they act on top-level formulae
in a nested sequent. The calculus LBiKt is ill-suited for backward proof search
due to the presence of certain structural rules called ``display postulates''
and the contraction rules on arbitrary structures. We show that these
structural rules can be made redundant in another calculus, DBiKt, which uses
deep inference, allowing one to apply inference rules at an arbitrary depth in
a nested sequent. We prove the equivalence between LBiKt and DBiKt and outline
a proof search strategy for DBiKt. We also give a Kripke semantics and prove
that LBiKt is sound with respect to the semantics, but completeness is still an
open problem. We then discuss various extensions of LBiKt.

evolution of giant planets embedded in a protoplanetary disk with a dead-zone.
The aim is to examine to what extent the presence of a dead-zone affects the
rates of mass accretion and migration for giant planets. We performed 3D
numerical simulations using a grid-based hydrodynamics code. In these
simulations of non-magnetised disks, the dead-zone is treated as a region where
the vertical profile of the viscosity depends on the distance from the
equatorial plane. We consider dead-zones with vertical sizes, H_dz, ranging
from 0 to H_dz=2.3H, where H is the disk scale-height. For all models, the
vertically integrated viscous stress, and the related mass flux through the
disk, have the same value, such that the simulations test the dependence of
planetary mass accretion and migration on the vertical distribution of the
viscous stress. For each model, an embedded 30 earth-masses planet on a fixed
circular orbit is allowed to accrete gas from the disk. Once the planet mass
becomes equal to that of Saturn or Jupiter, we allow the planet orbit to evolve
due to gravitational interaction with the disk. We find that the time scale
over which a protoplanet grows to become a giant planet is essentially
independent of the dead-zone size, and depends only on the total rate at which
the disk viscously supplies material to the planet. For Saturn-mass planets,
the migration rate depends only weakly on the size of the dead-zone for H_dz<
1.5H, but becomes slower when H_dz=2.3H. This effect is due to the desaturation
of corotation torques which originate from residual material in the partial-gap
region. For Jupiter-mass planets, there is a clear tendency for the migration
to proceed more slowly as the size of the dead-zone increases.

Please see arXiv:1007.0145",,,,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We analyzed the behavior of the rotational velocity in the parent stars of
extrasolar planets. Projected rotational velocity v sin i and angular momentum
were combined with stellar and planetary parameters, for a unique sample of 147
stars, amounting to 184 extrasolar planets, including 25 multiple systems.
Indeed, for the present working sample we considered only stars with planets
detected by the radial-velocity procedure. Our analysis shows that the v sin i
distribution of stars with planets along the HR Diagram follows the well
established scenario for the rotation of intermediate to low main sequence
stars, with a sudden decline in rotation near 1.2 Msun. The decline occurs
around Teff ~ 6000 K, corresponding to the late-F spectral region. A
statistical comparison of the distribution of the rotation of stars with
planets and a sample of stars without planets indicates that the v sin i
distribution for these two families of stars is drawn from the same population
distribution function. We also found that the angular momentum of extrasolar
planet parent stars follows, at least qualitatively, Krafts relation J \alpha
(M/Msun)^{\alpha}. The stars without detected planets show a clear trend of
angular momentum deficit compared to the stars with planets, in particular for
masses higher than about 1.25 Msun. Stars with the largest mass planets tend to
have angular momentum comparable to or higher than the Sun.

strongly suppressed leading to a reduced conductance. Here we demonstrate that
this reduced conductance can be turned to an infinite one by tuning the
nanoscale geometry. Creating variable size nanojunctions between a thin
metallic film and a superconducting tip we study how multiple phase-coherent
scatterings enhance the superconducting correlations at the normal side. By
increasing the coherent volume of carriers initially the transmission through

reaches the opposite surface of the thin film a resonator is formed, and a
robust transition is induced due to Cooper pair condensation.

Carinae with the goal of constraining the rotational velocity of the primary
star and probing the influence of the companion. Using 2-D radiative transfer
models of latitude-dependent stellar winds, we find that prolate wind models
with a ratio of the rotational velocity (vrot) to the critical velocity (vcrit)
of W=0.77-0.92, inclination angle of i=60-90 degrees, and position angle
PA=108-142 degrees reproduce simultaneously K-band continuum visibilities from
VLTI/VINCI and closure phase measurements from VLTI/AMBER. Interestingly,
oblate models with W=0.73-0.90 and i=80-90 degrees produce similar fits to the
interferometric data, but require PA=210-230 degrees. Therefore, both prolate
and oblate models suggest that the rotation axis of the primary star is not
aligned with the Homunculus polar axis. We also compute radiative transfer
models of the primary star allowing for the presence of a cavity and dense
wind-wind interaction region created by the companion star. We find that the
wind-wind interaction has a significant effect on the K-band image mainly via
free-free emission from the compressed walls and, for reasonable model
parameters, can reproduce the VLTI/VINCI visibilities taken at phase 0.92-0.93.
We conclude that the density structure of the primary wind can be sufficiently
disturbed by the companion, thus mimicking the effects of fast rotation in the
interferometric observables. Therefore, fast rotation may not be the only
explanation for the interferometric observations. Intense temporal monitoring
and 3-D modeling are needed to resolve these issues.

contain a white dwarf with stable nuclear burning on its surface. These
sources, first discovered in the Magellanic Clouds, have high accretion rates
and near-Eddington luminosities (10^37 - 10^38 erg/s) with high temperatures (T
= 2 - 7 x 10^5 K). Aims. The total number of known objects in the MC is still
small and, in our galaxy, even smaller. We observed the field of the
unidentified transient supersoft X-ray source RX J0527.8-6954 in order to
identify its optical counterpart. Methods. The observation was made with the
IFU-GMOS on the Gemini South telescope with the purpose of identifying stars
with possible He II or Balmer emission or else of observing nebular extended
jets or ionization cones, features that may be expected in CBSS. Results. The
X-ray source is identified with a B5e V star that is associated with
subarcsecond extended Halpha emission, possibly bipolar. Conclusions. If the
primary star is a white dwarf, as suggested by the supersoft X-ray spectrum,
the expected orbital period exceeds 21 h; therefore, we believe that the 9.4 h
period found so far is not associated to this system.

The algorithm finds an ordering of the disjoint subsets of variables by
iteratively evaluating the independence between the variable subset and the
residuals when the remaining variables are regressed on those. However, its
computational cost grows exponentially according to the number of variables.
Therefore, we further discuss an efficient approximate approach for applying
the algorithm to large sized graphs. We illustrate the algorithm with
