Although the neutralino in the minimal supersymmetric model (MSSM), the
next-to-minimal supersymmetric model (NMSSM) and the nearly minimal
supersymmetric model (nMSSM) can naturaly explain the dark matter relic
density, the PAMELA result can hardly be explained in these popular models. In
the general singlet extension of the MSSM, both the PAMELA result and the relic
density can be explained by the singlino-like neutralino. Such singlino-like
neutralinos annihilate into the singlet-like Higgs bosons, which are light
enough to decay dominantly to muons or electrons, and the annihilation cross
section can be greatly enhanced by the Sommerfeld effect via exchanging a light
CP-even singlet-like Higgs boson. In this scenario, in order to meet the
stringent LEP constraints, the SM-like Higgs boson tends to decay into the
singlet Higgs pairs instead of $b\bar b$ and consequently it will give a
multi-muon signal $h_SM->aa->\mu$ or $h_{SM}->hh->4 a ->8 \mu$ at the LHC.

possibly one of the most direct future probes of reionization. We consider two
models for the growth of spherical ionized bubbles to study the apparent shapes
of the bubbles in redshifted 21-cm maps, taking into account the finite light
travel time (FLTT) across the bubble. We find that the FLTT, whose effect is
particularly pronounced for large bubbles, causes the bubble's image to
continue to grow well after it's actual growth is over. There are two distinct
FLTT distortions in the bubble's image: (i) its apparent center is shifted
along the line of sight (LOS) towards the observer from the quasar; (ii) it's
shape is anisotropic along the LOS. The bubble initially appears elongated
along the LOS. This is reversed in the later stages of growth where the bubble
appears compressed. The FLTT distortions are expected to have an impact on
matched filter bubble detection where it is most convenient to use a spherical
template for the filter. We find that the best matched spherical filter gives a
reasonably good estimate of the size and the shift in the center of the
anisotropic image. The mismatch between the spherical filter and the
anisotropic image causes a 10 - 20% degradation in the SNR relative to that of
a spherical bubble. We conclude that a spherical filter is adequate for bubble
detection. The FLTT distortions do not effect the lower limits for bubble
detection with 1000 hr of GMRT observations. The smallest spherical filter for
which a detection is possible has comoving radii 24 Mpc and 33 Mpc for a
3-sigma and 5-sigma detection respectively, assuming a neutral fraction 0.6 at
z \sim 8.

test-particle spiraling a Kerr black hole in the equatorial plane, we find that
factorized multipolar amplitudes which replace the residual relativistic
amplitude f_{l m} with its l-th root, \rho_{l m} = f_{l m}^{1/l}, agree quite
well with the numerical amplitudes up to the Kerr-spin value q \leq 0.95 for
orbital velocities v \leq 0.4. The numerical amplitudes are computed solving
the Teukolsky equation with a spectral code. The agreement for prograde orbits
and large spin values of the Kerr black hole can be further improved at high
velocities by properly factoring out the lower-order post-Newtonian
contributions in \rho_{l m}. The resummation procedure results in a better and
systematic agreement between numerical and analytical amplitudes (and energy
fluxes) than standard Taylor-expanded post-Newtonian approximants. This is
particularly true for higher-order modes, such as (2,1), (3,3), (3,2), and
(4,4) for which less spin post-Newtonian terms are known. We also extend the
factorized resummation of multipolar amplitudes to generic mass-ratio,
non-precessing, spinning black holes. Lastly, in our study we employ new,
recently computed, higher-order post-Newtonian terms in several subdominant
modes, and compute explicit expressions for the half and one-and-half
post-Newtonian contributions to the odd-parity (current) and even-parity (odd)
multipoles, respectively. Those results can be used to build more accurate

portion of a current sheet triggering stored magnetic energy to be thermalized
by shocks. When the initial current sheet separates magnetic fields which are
not perfectly anti-parallel, i.e. they are skewed, magnetic energy is first
converted to bulk kinetic energy and then thermalized in slow magnetosonic
shocks. We show that the latter resemble parallel shocks or hydrodynamic shocks
for all skew angles except those very near the anti-parallel limit. As for
parallel shocks, the structures of reconnection-driven slow shocks are best
studied using two-fluid equations in which ions and electrons have independent
temperature. Time-dependent solutions of these equations can be used to predict
and understand the shocks from reconnection of skewed magnetic fields. The
results differ from those found using a single-fluid model such as
magnetohydrodynamics. In the two-fluid model electrons are heated indirectly
and thus carry a heat flux always well below the free-streaming limit. The
viscous stress of the ions is, however, typically near the fluid-treatable
limit. We find that for a wide range of skew angles and small plasma beta an
electron conduction front extends ahead of the slow shock but remains within
the outflow jet. In such cases conduction will play a more limited role in
driving chromospheric evaporation than has been predicted based on
single-fluid, anti-parallel models.

all publicly available XMM-Newton observations of the galaxy. This new survey
provides the most complete and homogeneous X-ray survey of M31's GCs to date,
covering >80% of the confirmed old clusters in the galaxy. We associate 41
X-ray sources with confirmed old clusters in the M31 cluster catalogue of
Peacock et al. (2010). Comparing these data with previous surveys of M31, it is
found that three of these clusters are newly identified, including a bright
transient source in the cluster B128. Four additional clusters, that are not
detected in these 2XMMi data, have previously been associated with X-ray
sources from Chandra or ROSAT observations. Including these clusters, we
identify 45 clusters in M31 which are associated with X-ray emission. By
considering the latest optical GC catalogues, we identify that three of the
previously proposed X-ray clusters are likely to be background galaxies and two
have stellar profiles. We consider the properties of LMXB-hosting clusters and
confirm significant trends between the presence of an LMXB and the metallicity,
luminosity and stellar collision rate of a cluster. We consider the
relationship between the luminosity and stellar collision rate of a cluster and
note that LMXB hosting clusters have higher than average stellar collision
rates for their mass. Our findings strongly suggest that the stellar collision
rate is the dominant parameter related to the presence of LMXBs. This is
consistent with the formation of LMXBs in GCs through dynamical interactions.

instantaneous action-at-a-distance and inseparable wave-particle character are

action, it is reasoned that the spin of a particle just as the polarization of
a photon remain indetermined for the observer until at least a quantum of
action flows from the object to the observer. The detection places the quantity
in question in the observer's frame of reference. This reference frame for one
photon will instantaneously apply also to the polarization of the other photon
provided that the two photons have not been perturbed ever since the correlated
pair emerged from a radiative decay. The wave-particle duality of a single
photon or an electron, that the double-slit experiment demonstrates, can also
be understood in terms of actions. The energy density difference between the
source of particles and their sink at the detector is a driving force that will
cause flows of energy densities such as photons or electrons to propagate down
along the paths of least action. Since no space is empty of energy density, the
propagating particle as a flow of density will invariably perturb surrounding
densities. When the driving density difference including the perturbation is
leveling off via two or more paths, the ensuing flows of densities depend on
each other. Therefore the flows through the two slits can never be separated
from each other which will manifest as the inseparable particle-wave character.

  arXive:1002.2410",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The discovery of quantum key distribution by Bennett and Brassard (BB84)
bases on the fundamental quantum feature: incompatibility of measurements of
quantum non-commuting observables. In 1991 Ekert showed that cryptographic key
can be generated at a distance with help of entangled (correlated) quantum
particles. Recently Barrett, Hardy and Kent showed that the non-locality used
by Ekert is itself a good resource of cryptographic key even beyond quantum
mechanics. Their result paved the way to new generation of quantum
cryptographic protocols - secure even if the devices are built by the very
eavesdropper. However, there is a question, which is fundamental from both
practical and philosophical point of view: does Nature offer security on
operational level based on the original concept behind quantum cryptography -
that information gain about one observable must cause disturbance to another,
incompatible one?
  Here we resolve this problem by using another striking feature of quantum
world - contextuality. It is a strong version of incompatibility manifested in
the famous Kochen-Specker paradox. The crucial concept is the use of a new
class of families of bipartite probability distributions . We show that if two
persons share systems which locally exhibit the Kochen-Specker paradox and, in
addition, exhibit perfect correlations, then they can extract secure key, even
if they do not trust the quantum devices. This is the first operational
protocol that directly implements the fundamental feature of Nature: the
information gain vs. disturbance trade-off.
  For sake of proof we exhibit a new Bell's inequality which is interesting in
itself. The security is proved not by exploiting strong violation of the
inequality by quantum mechanics (as one usually proceeds), but rather by
arguing, that quantum mechanics cannot violate it too much.

two-Higgs-doublet model results in the absence of tree-level flavour-changing
neutral currents. In addition to the usual fermion masses and mixings, the
aligned Yukawa structure only contains three complex parameters, which are
potential new sources of CP violation. For particular values of these three
parameters all known specific implementations of the model based on discrete
Z_2 symmetries are recovered. One of the most distinctive features of the
two-Higgs-doublet model is the presence of a charged scalar. In this work, we
discuss its main phenomenological consequences in flavour-changing processes at
low energies and derive the corresponding constraints on the parameters of the

technology that is expected to rapidly penetrate the transportation system.
Renewable energy sources such as wind and solar have received considerable
attention as clean power options for future generation expansion. However,
these sources are intermittent and increase the uncertainty in the ability to
generate power. The deployment of PHEVs in a vehicle-to-grid (V2G) system
provide a potential mechanism for reducing the variability of renewable energy
sources. For example, PHEV supporting infrastructures like battery exchange
stations that provide battery service to PHEV customers could be used as
storage devices to stabilize the grid when renewable energy production is
fluctuating. In this paper, we study how to best site these stations in terms
of how they can support both the transportation system and the power grid. To
model this problem we develop a two-stage stochastic program to optimally
locate the stations prior to the realization of battery demands, loads, and
generation capacity of renewable power sources. We develop two test cases to
study the benefits and the performance of these systems.

non-causal origin, i.e. they do not imply the need for any physically coupled
growth of black hole and bulge mass, for example through feedback by active
galactic nuclei (AGN). Provided some physics for the absolute normalisation,
the creation of the scaling relations can be fully explained by the
hierarchical assembly of black hole and stellar mass through galaxy merging,
from an initially uncorrelated distribution of BH and stellar masses in the
early Universe. We show this with a suite of dark matter halo merger trees for
which we make assumptions about (uncorrelated) black hole and stellar mass
values at early cosmic times. We then follow the halos in the presence of
global star formation and black hole accretion recipes that (i) work without
any coupling of the two properties per individual galaxy and (ii) correctly
reproduce the observed star formation and black hole accretion rate density in
the Universe. With disk-to-bulge conversion in mergers included, our
simulations even create the observed slope of ~1.1 for the
M_BH-M_bulge-relations at z=0. This also implies that AGN feedback is not a
required (though still a possible) ingredient in galaxy evolution. In light of
this, other mechanisms that can be invoked to truncate star formation in
massive galaxies are equally justified.

identify the effect of spiral-bar resonance overlap by measuring a bimodality
in the changes of angular momentum in the disk, dL, whose maxima are near the
bar's corotation and outer Lindblad resonance. This contrasts with the smooth
distribution of dL for a simulation with no stable bar present, where strong
radial migration is induced by multiple spirals. The presence of a disk gaseous
component appears to increase the rate of angular momentum exchange by about
20%. The efficiency of this mechanism is such that galactic stellar disks can
extend to over 10 scale-lengths within 1-3 Gyr in both Milky Way size and

(b) a lower bound for r: r > 0.023 (95% CL) and r > 0.046 (68% CL). (c) The
preferred inflation potential is a double well, even function of the field with
a moderate quartic coupling yielding as most probable values: n_s = 0.964, r =
0.051. This value for r is within reach of forthcoming CMB observations. We
investigate the DM properties using cosmological theory and the galaxy

function of galaxy mass and radius within the galaxy. Previous attempts to
measure such deficits depended on fitting some functional form to the profile
at large radii and extrapolating inwards; this is sensitive to the assumed
functional form and does not allow for variation in nuclear profile shapes. We
take advantage of larger data sets to directly construct stellar mass profiles
of observed systems and measure the stellar mass enclosed in a series of
physical radii (M(<R)), for samples of cusp and core spheroids at the same
stellar mass. There is a significant bimodality in this distribution at small
radii, and we non-parametrically measure the median offset between core and
cusp populations (the deficit Delta_M(<R)). We construct the scoured mass
profile as a function of radius, without reference to any assumed functional
form. The mass deficit rises in power-law fashion (Delta_M(<R) R^{1.3-1.8})
from a significant but small mass at R<10pc, to asymptote to a maximum ~0.5-2
M_BH at ~100pc. At larger radii there is no statistically significant
separation between populations; the upper limit to the cumulative scoured mass
at ~kpc is ~2-4 M_BH. This does not depend strongly on stellar mass. The
dispersion in M(<R) appears larger in the core population, possibly reflecting
the fact that scouring increases the scatter in profile shapes. These results
are in good agreement with models of scouring from BH binary systems.

representative type Ia supernova explosion models: a pure deflagration and a
delayed detonation. Methods: We calculate the neutrino flux from $\beta$
processes using nuclear statistical equilibrium abundances convoluted with
approximate neutrino spectra of the individual nuclei and the thermal neutrino
spectrum (pair+plasma). Results: Although the two considered thermonuclear
supernova explosion scenarios are expected to produce almost identical
electromagnetic output, their neutrino signatures appear vastly different,
which allow an unambiguous identification of the explosion mechanism: a pure
deflagration produces a single peak in the neutrino light curve, while the
addition of the second maximum characterizes a delayed-detonation. We
identified the following main contributors to the neutrino signal: (1) weak
electron neutrino emission from electron captures (in particular on the protons
Co55 and Ni56) and numerous beta-active nuclei produced by the thermonuclear
flame and/or detonation front, (2) electron antineutrinos from positron
captures on neutrons, and (3) the thermal emission from pair annihilation. We
estimate that a pure deflagration supernova explosion at a distance of 1 kpc
would trigger about 14 events in the future 50 kt liquid scintillator detector
and some 19 events in a 0.5 Mt water Cherenkov-type detector. Conclusions:
While in contrast to core-collapse supernovae neutrinos carry only a very small
fraction of the energy produced in the thermonuclear supernova explosion, the
SN Ia neutrino signal provides information that allows us to unambiguously
distinguish between different possible explosion scenarios. These studies will
become feasible with the next generation of proposed neutrino observatories.

combinatorial, but two years later Furstenberg gave a quite different proof of

yielded several other results in extremal combinatorics, as well as revealing a
range of new phenomena according to which the structures of

comb and a Fabry-P\'erot cavity used to achieve calibrator line spacings that
can be resolved by an astrophysical spectrograph. Systematic spectral shifts
associated with the cavity can be 0.1-1 MHz, corresponding to RV errors of
10-100 cm/s, due to the dispersive properties of the cavity mirrors over broad
spectral widths. Although these systematic shifts are very stable, their
correction is crucial to high accuracy astrophysical spectroscopy. Here, we
demonstrate an \emph{in-situ} technique to determine the systematic shifts of

general Z-IC with an arbitrary number of antennas at each node under the
assumptions of full channel state information at the transmitters (CSIT) and a
short-term average power constraint. In the GDMT framework, the direct link
signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and cross-link interference-to-noise ratio (INR)
are allowed to vary so that their ratios relative to a nominal SNR in the dB
scale, i.e., the SNR/INR exponents, are fixed. It is shown that a simple
Han-Kobayashi message-splitting/partial interference decoding scheme that uses
only partial CSIT -- in which the second transmitter's signal depends only on
its cross-link channel matrix and the first user's transmit signal doesn't need
any CSIT whatsoever -- can achieve the full-CSIT GDMT of the MIMO Z-IC. The
GDMT of the MIMO Z-IC under the No-CSIT assumption is also obtained for some
range of multiplexing gains. The size of this range depends on the numbers of
antennas at the four nodes and the SNR and INR exponents of the direct and
cross links, respectively. For certain classes of channels including those in
which the interfered receiver has more antennas than do the other nodes, or
when the INR exponent is greater than a certain threshold, the GDMT of the MIMO
Z-IC under the No-CSIT assumption is completely characterized.

that von Neumann's 'no hidden variables' proof fails to exclude any significant

that any hidden variable theory would have to be nonlocal, and in this sense
'like Bohm's theory.' His seminal result provides a positive answer to the
question. I argue that Bell's analysis misconstrues von Neumann's argument.
What von Neumann proved was the impossibility of recovering the quantum
probabilities from a hidden variable theory of dispersion free (deterministic)
states in which the quantum observables are represented as the 'beables' of the
theory, to use Bell's term. That is, the quantum probabilities could not
reflect the distribution of pre-measurement values of beables, but would have
to be derived in some other way, e.g., as in Bohm's theory, where the
probabilities are an artefact of a dynamical process that is not in fact a
measurement of any beable of the system.

luminous blue variable (LBV) in NGC 3432, covering three major outbursts in
October 2008, April 2009 and November 2009. Previously, this star experienced
an outburst also in 2000 (known as SN 2000ch). During outbursts the star
reached an absolute magnitude between -12.1 and -12.8. Its spectrum showed H,
He I and Fe II lines with P-Cygni profiles during and soon after the eruptive
phases, while only intermediate-width lines in pure emission (including He II
4686A were visible during quiescence. The fast-evolving light curve soon after
the outbursts, the quasi-modulated light curve, the peak magnitude and the
overall spectral properties are consistent with multiple episodes of
variability of an extremely active LBV. However, the widths of the spectral
lines indicate unusually high wind velocities (1500-2800 km/s), similar to
those observed in Wolf-Rayet stars. Although modulated light curves are typical
of LBVs during the S-Dor variability phase, the luminous maxima and the high
frequency of outbursts are unexpected in S-Dor variables. Such extreme
variability may be associated with repeated ejection episodes during a giant
eruption of an LBV. Alternatively, it may be indicative of a high level of
instability shortly preceding the core-collapse or due to interaction with a
massive, binary companion. In this context, the variable in NGC 3432 shares
some similarities with the famous stellar system HD 5980 in the Small
Magellanic Cloud, which includes an erupting LBV and an early Wolf-Rayet star.

stimulated world wide efforts to extend their scope to also capture more

for bosons, Feynmans fundamental ""no-node"" theorem under very general
circumstances predicts a positive definite ground state wave function with
limited relevance for many-body systems of interest. A promising way around
Feynmans statement is to consider higher bands in optical lattices with more
than one dimension, where the orbital degree of freedom with its intrinsic
anisotropy due to multiple orbital orientations gives rise to a structural
diversity, highly relevant, for example, in the area of strongly correlated
electronic matter. In homogeneous two-dimensional optical lattices, lifetimes
of excited bands on the order of a hundred milliseconds are possible but the
tunneling dynamics appears not to support cross-dimensional coherence. Here we
report the first observation of a superfluid in the $P$-band of a bipartite
optical square lattice with $S$-orbits and $P$-orbits arranged in a
chequerboard pattern. This permits us to establish full cross-dimensional
coherence with a life-time of several ten milliseconds. Depending on a small
adjustable anisotropy of the lattice, we can realize real-valued striped
superfluid order parameters with different orientations $P_x \pm P_y$ or a
complex-valued $P_x \pm i P_y$ order parameter, which breaks time reversal
symmetry and resembles the $\pi$-flux model proposed in the context of high
temperature superconductors. Our experiment opens up the realms of orbital
superfluids to investigations with optical lattice models.

the degree to which network structure contributes to the importance of a node
in a network. While many different centrality measures exist, most of them
apply to static networks. Most networks, on the other hand, are dynamic in
nature, evolving over time through the addition or deletion of nodes and edges.
A popular approach to analyzing such networks represents them by a static
network that aggregates all edges observed over some time period. This
approach, however, under or overestimates centrality of some nodes. We address
this problem by introducing a novel centrality metric for dynamic network
analysis. This metric exploits an intuition that in order for one node in a
dynamic network to influence another over some period of time, there must exist
a path that connects the source and destination nodes through intermediaries at
different times. We demonstrate on an example network that the proposed metric
leads to a very different ranking than analysis of an equivalent static
network. We use dynamic centrality to study a dynamic citations network and
contrast results to those reached by static network analysis.

radii. Namely, if a finite number of points in Euclidean space $E^n$ is
rearranged so that the distance between each pair of points does not decrease,
then there exists a positive number $r_0$ that depends on the rearrangement of
the points, such that if we consider $n$-dimensional balls of radius $r>r_0$
with centers at these points, then the volume of the union (intersection) of
the balls before the rearrangement is not less (not greater) than the volume of
the union (intersection) after the rearrangement. Moreover, the inequality is
strict whenever the new point set is not congruent to the original one. Also
under the same conditions we prove a similar result about surface volumes
instead of volumes.
  In order to prove the above mentioned results we use ideas from tensegrity
theory to strengthen the theorem of Sudakov, R. Alexander and Capoyleas and
Pach, which says that the mean width of the convex hull of a finite number of
points does not decrease after an expansive rearrangement of those points. In
this paper we show that the mean width increases strictly, unless the expansive
rearrangement was a congruence.
  We also show that if the configuration of centers of the balls is fixed and
the volume of the intersection of the balls is considered as a function of the
radius $r$, then the second highest term in the asymptotic expansion of this
function is equal to $-M_n r^{n-1}$, where $M_n$ is the mean width of the
convex hall of the centers. This theorem was conjectured by Balazs Csikos in
2009.

PDF of several flow variables is computed by numerically integrating a system
of stochastic differential equations for Lagrangian particles. A set of
parallel algorithms is proposed to provide an efficient solution of the PDF
transport equation, modeling the joint PDF of turbulent velocity, frequency and
concentration of a passive scalar in geometrically complex configurations. An
unstructured Eulerian grid is employed to extract Eulerian statistics, to solve
for quantities represented at fixed locations of the domain (e.g. the mean
pressure) and to track particles. All three aspects regarding the grid make use
of the finite element method (FEM) employing the simplest linear FEM shape
functions. To model the small-scale mixing of the transported scalar, the
interaction by exchange with the conditional mean model is adopted. An adaptive
algorithm that computes the velocity-conditioned scalar mean is proposed that
homogenizes the statistical error over the sample space with no assumption on
the shape of the underlying velocity PDF. Compared to other hybrid
particle-in-cell approaches for the PDF equations, the current methodology is
consistent without the need for consistency conditions. The algorithm is tested
by computing the dispersion of passive scalars released from concentrated
sources in two different turbulent flows: the fully developed turbulent channel
flow and a street canyon (or cavity) flow. Algorithmic details on estimating
conditional and unconditional statistics, particle tracking and particle-number

triaxial. Verifying observationally this theoretical prediction is, however,
less than straightforward because the assembly of galaxies is expected to
modify the halo shapes and to render them more axisymmetric. We use a suite of
N-body simulations to investigate quantitatively the effect of the growth of a
central disk galaxy on the shape of triaxial dark matter halos. As expected,
the halo responds to the presence of the disk by becoming more spherical. The
net effect depends only weakly on the orientation of the disk relative to the
halo principal axes or the timescale of disk assembly, but strongly on the
overall gravitational importance of the disk. Our results show that exponential
disks whose contribution peaks at less than ~50% of their circular velocity are
unable to modify noticeably the shape of the gravitational potential of their
surrounding halos. Many dwarf and low surface brightness galaxies are expected
to be in this regime, and therefore their detailed kinematics could be used to
probe halo triaxiality, one of the basic predictions of the CDM paradigm. We
argue that the complex disk kinematics of the dwarf galaxy NGC 2976 might be
the reflection of a triaxial halo. Such signatures of halo triaxiality should
be common in galaxies where the luminous component is subdominant.

dominated by the receiver with the weakest link in order to minimize outage and

(MTC) as the maximum achievable multicast rate times the number of multicast
clusters per unit volume, accounting for outages and retransmissions. Our main
result shows that if $\tau$ transmission attempts are allowed in a multicast
cluster, the MTC is $\Theta\left(\rho k^{x}\log(k)\right)$ where $\rho$ and $x$
are functions of $\tau$ depending on the network size and density, and $k$ is
the average number of the intended receivers in a cluster. We also show that an

system is the classical point vortex system obtained from a singular discrete
representation of the vorticity field from incompressible fluid flow. When
{\Gamma} is purely imaginary, it corresponds to a system of sources and sinks,
whereas when {\Gamma} from C^N the system consists of spiral sources and sinks
discussed in Kochin et. al. (1964). We formulate the equilibrium problem as one
in linear algebra, A\Gamma = 0, where A is a NxN complex skew-symmetric
configuration matrix which encodes the geometry of the system of interacting
singularities. For an equilibrium to exist, A must have a kernel. {\Gamma} must
then be an element of the nullspace of A. We prove that when N is odd, A always
has a kernel, hence there is a choice of {\Gamma} for which the system is a
fixed equilibrium. When N is even, there may or may not be a non-trivial
nullspace of A, depending on the relative position of the points in the plane.
We describe a method for classifying the equilibria in terms of the
distribution of the non-zero eigenvalues (singular values) of A, or
equivalently, the non-zero eigenvalues of the associated covariance matrix A'A,

are embedded in a perfectly uniform dark energy background, represented by
Einstein's cosmological constant, and experience its repulsive antigravity
action. Can dark energy have strong dynamical effects on small cosmic scales as
well as globally? Continuing our efforts to clarify this question, we focus now
on the Virgo Cluster and the flow of expansion around it. We interpret the
Hubble diagram, from a new database of velocities and distances of galaxies in
the cluster and its environment, using a nonlinear analytical model which
incorporates the antigravity force in terms of Newtonian mechanics. The key
parameter is the zero-gravity radius, the distance at which gravity and
antigravity are in balance. Our conclusions are: 1. The interplay between the
gravity of the cluster and the antigravity of the dark energy background
determines the kinematical structure of the system and controls its evolution.
2. The gravity dominates the quasi-stationary bound cluster, while the
antigravity controls the Virgocentric flow, bringing order and regularity to
the flow, which reaches linearity and the global Hubble rate at distances \ga
15 Mpc. 3. The cluster and the flow form a system similar to the Local Group
and its outflow. In the velocity-distance diagram, the cluster-flow structure
reproduces the group-flow structure with a scaling factor of about 10; the
zero-gravity radius for the cluster system is also 10 times larger. The phase
and dynamical similarity of the systems on the scales of 1-30 Mpc suggests that
a two-component pattern may be universal for groups and clusters: a
quasi-stationary bound central component and an expanding outflow around it,
due to the nonlinear gravity-antigravity interplay with the dark energy
dominating in the flow component.

they can completely alter the cosmic evolution of the universe dominated

and interaction matrix elements (like the Hubbard U) in a localized basis set.
In this work, we employ the scheme of maximally localized Wannier functions and
the constrained random phase approximation to create effective low-energy
models for Manganese monoxide, and track their evolution under external
pressure. We find that in the low pressure antiferromagnetic phase, the
compression results in an increase of the bare Coulomb interaction for specific
orbitals. As we rationalized in recent model considerations [Phys. Rev. B 79,
235133 (2009)], this seemingly counter-intuitive behavior is a consequence of
the delocalization of the respective Wannier functions. The change of screening
processes does not alter this tendency, and thus, the screened on-site
component of the interaction - the Hubbard U of the effective low-energy system
- increases with pressure as well. The orbital anisotropy of the effects
originates from the orientation of the orbitals vis-a-vis the deformation of
the unit-cell. Within the high pressure paramagnetic phase, on the other hand,
we find the significant increase of the Hubbard U is insensitive to the orbital
orientation and almost exclusively owing to a substantial weakening of
screening channels upon compression.

various regimes of temperature and baryon number density. For small and medium
densities, the phase transition is accurately described in the framework of the
Field Correlation Method, whereas at high density predictions are less certain
and leave room for the phenomenological models. We study formation of
multiquark states (MQS) at zero temperature and high density. Relevant MQS
components of the nuclear matter can be described using a previously developed
formalism of the quark compound bags (QCB).
  Partial-wave analysis of nucleon-nucleon scattering indicates the existence
of 6QS which manifest themselves as poles of $P$-matrix. In the framework of
the QCB model, we formulate a self-consistent system of coupled equations for
the nucleon and 6QS propagators in nuclear matter and the G-matrix. The
approach provides a link between high-density nuclear matter with the MQS
components and the cumulative effect observed in reactions on the nuclei, which
requires the admixture of MQS in the wave functions of nuclei kinematically.
  6QS determine the natural scale of the density for a possible phase
transition into the MQS phase of nuclear matter. Such a phase transition can
lead to dynamic instability of newly born protoneutron stars and dramatically
affect the dynamics of supernovae. Numerical simulations show that the phase
transition may be a good remedy for the triggering supernova explosions in the
spherically symmetric supernova models. A specific signature of the phase
transition is an additional neutrino peak in the neutrino light curve. For a
Galactic core-collapse supernova, such a peak could be resolved by the present

neutrinoless double beta decay (0nbb-decay). By exploiting the fact that the
associated nuclear matrix elements are target dependent we show that, given
definite experimental results on a sufficient number of targets, one can
determine or sufficiently constrain all lepton violating parameters including
the mass term. As a specific example we show that, assuming the observation of
the 0nbb-decay in three different nuclei, e.g., 76Ge, 100Mo and 130Te, and just
three lepton number violating mechanisms (light and heavy neutrino mass
mechanisms as well as R-parity breaking SUSY mechanism) being active, there are
only four different solutions for the lepton violating parameters, provided
that they are relatively real. In particular, assuming evidence of the
0nbb-decay of 76Ge, the effective neutrino Majorana mass |m_bb| can be almost
uniquely extracted by utilizing other existing constraints (cosmological
observations and tritium beta-decay experiments). We also point out the
possibility that the non-observation of the 0nbb-decay for some isotopes could
be in agreement with a value of |m_bb| in sub eV region. We thus suggest that
it is important to have at least two different 0nbb-decay experiments for a
given nucleus.

gas phase chemistry in the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) is a key input in
unraveling the coupled chemical and dynamical evolution of the ISM. Methods.
The lowest rotational lines of HCO+, HCN, HNC, and CN were observed at the
IRAM-30m telescope in absorption against the \lambda 3 mm and \lambda 1.3 mm
continuum emission of massive star-forming regions in the Galactic plane. The
absorption lines probe the gas over kiloparsecs along these lines of sight. The
excitation temperatures of HCO+ are inferred from the comparison of the
absorptions in the two lowest transitions. The spectra of all molecular species
on the same line of sight are decomposed into Gaussian velocity components.
Most appear in all the spectra of a given line of sight. For each component, we
derived the central opacity, the velocity dispersion, and computed the
molecular column density. We compared our results to the predictions of
UV-dominated chemical models of photodissociation regions (PDR models) and to
those of non-equilibrium models in which the chemistry is driven by the
dissipation of turbulent energy (TDR models). Results. The molecular column
densities of all the velocity components span up to two orders of magnitude.
Those of CN, HCN, and HNC are linearly correlated with each other with mean
ratios N(HCN)/N(HNC) = 4.8 $\pm$ 1.3 and N(CN)/N(HNC) = 34 $\pm$ 12, and more
loosely correlated with those of HCO+, N(HNC)/N(HCO+) = 0.5 $\pm$ 0.3,
N(HCN)/N(HCO+) = 1.9 $\pm$ 0.9, and N(CN)/N(HCO+) = 18 $\pm$ 9. These ratios
are similar to those inferred from observations of high Galactic latitude lines
of sight, suggesting that the gas sampled by absorption lines in the Galactic
plane has the same chemical properties as that in the Solar neighbourhood. The
FWHM of the Gaussian velocity components span the range 0.3 to 3 km s-1 and
those of the HCO+ lines are found to be 30% broader than those of CN-bearing
molecules. The PDR models fail to reproduce simultaneously the observed
abundances of the CN-bearing species and HCO+, even for high-density material
(100 cm-3 < nH < 104 cm-3). The TDR models, in turn, are able to reproduce the
observed abundances and abundance ratios of all the analysed molecules for the
moderate gas densities (30 cm-3 < nH < 200 cm-3) and the turbulent energy
observed in the diffuse interstellar medium. Conclusions. Intermittent
turbulent dissipation appears to be a promising driver of the gas phase
chemistry of the diffuse and translucent gas throughout the Galaxy. The details
of the dissipation mechanisms still need to be investigated.

constructed by doped holes under the coexistence of a metallic state and of the
local antiferromagnetic order. Below $T_{\rm c}$ the holes on Fermi pockets
form Cooper pairs with d-wave symmetry in the nodal region. In the antinodal
region all the states below the Fermi level are occupied by electrons so that
there is no gap, not even pseudo both below and above $T_{\rm c}$. Calculated

find that radiative lifetime of the vibrational levels increases strongly with
$v$, the lifetime of the $v=0$ state being of 150 s. We also analyze the

between a soft elastic layer and a rough rigid substrate. The solution of the
problem is obtained by calculating the Green's function which links the
pressure distribution to the normal displacements at the interface. The problem
is then formulated in the form of a Fredholm integral equation of the first
kind with a logarithmic kernel, and the boundaries of the contact area are
calculated by requiring that the energy of the system is stationary. The
methodology has been employed to study the adhesive contact between an elastic
semi-infinite solid and a randomly rough rigid profile with a self-affine
fractal geometry. We show that, even in presence of adhesion, the true contact
area still linearly depends on the applied load. The numerical results are then
critically compared with the prediction of an extended version of the Persson's
contact mechanics theory, able to handle anisotropic surfaces, as 1D
interfaces. It is shown that, for any given load, Persson's theory
underestimates the contact area of about 50% in comparison with our numerical
calculations. We find that this discrepancy is larger than what is found for 2D
rough surfaces in case of adhesionless contact. We argue that this increased
difference might be explained, at least partially, by considering that
Persson's theory is a mean field theory in spirit, so it should work better for
2D rough surfaces rather than for 1D rough surfaces. We also observe, that the
predicted value of separation is in very good agreement with our numerical
results as well as the exponent of the power spectral density of the contact
pressure distribution and of the elastic displacement of the solid. Therefore,
we conclude that Persson's theory captures almost exactly the main qualitative
behavior of the rough contact phenomena.

wealth of cosmological information. Matching the signal at different redshifts
constrains the dark energy driving the acceleration of the expansion of the

distortions (RSD) depend on the build up of large-scale structure. As pointed
out by many authors measurements of these effects are intrinsically coupled. We
investigate this link, and argue that it strongly depends on the cosmological
assumptions adopted when analysing data. Using representative assumptions for
the parameters of the Euclid survey in order to provide a baseline future
experiment, we show how the derived constraints change due to different model
assumptions. We argue that even the assumption of a Friedman-Robertson-Walker
(FRW) space-time is sufficient to reduce the importance of the coupling to a
significant degree. Taking this idea further, we consider how the data would
actually be analysed and argue that we should not expect to be able to
simultaneously constrain multiple deviations from the standard $\Lambda$CDM
model. We therefore consider different possible ways in which the Universe
could deviate from the $\Lambda$CDM model, and show how the coupling between
geometrical constraints and structure growth affects the measurement of such

which could include not only additional optical bands but also observables with
different nature such as X-rays. For each detection, the filter provides its
significance, an estimate for the richness and for the redshift even if photo-z
are not given. The provided analytical error estimate is tested against

simultaneously, polymerizing a protein using the mRNA also as the corresponding

efficiency of this machine. However, we arugue that its performance is
evaluated better in terms of the translational fidelity and the speed with
which it polymerizes a protein. We define both these quantities and calculate
these analytically. Fidelity is a measure of the quality of the products while
the total quantity of products synthesized in a given interval depends on the
speed of polymerization. We show that for synthesizing a large quantity of
proteins, it is not necessary to sacrifice the quality. We also explore the
effects of the quality control mechanism on the strength of mechano-chemical

power allocation for its ergodic capacity maximization subject to an average
sum (across the bands) transmit power constraint and individual average
interference constraints on the primary users. The major contribution of our
work lies in considering quantized channel state information (CSI)(for the
vector channel space consisting of all secondary-to-secondary and
secondary-to-primary channels) at the secondary transmitter. It is assumed that
a band manager or a cognitive radio service provider has access to the full CSI
information from the secondary and primary receivers and designs (offline) an
optimal power codebook based on the statistical information (channel
distributions) of the channels and feeds back the index of the codebook to the
secondary transmitter for every channel realization in real-time, via a
delay-free noiseless limited feedback channel. A modified Generalized
Lloyds-type algorithm (GLA) is designed for deriving the optimal power
codebook. An approximate quantized power allocation (AQPA) algorithm is also
presented, that performs very close to its GLA based counterpart for large
number of feedback bits and is significantly faster. We also present an
extension of the modified GLA based quantized power codebook design algorithm
for the case when the feedback channel is noisy. Numerical studies illustrate
that with only 3-4 bits of feedback, the modified GLA based algorithms provide
secondary ergodic capacity very close to that achieved by full CSI and with
only as little as 4 bits of feedback, AQPA provides a comparable performance,
thus making it an attractive choice for practical implementation.

negative charges present in the constriction zone of the wild type OmpF channel
(which contains on one side a cluster with three positive residues and on the
other side two negatively charged residues). Our results show that these
mutations induce an exclusion of cations from the constriction zone of the
channel, substantially reducing the flow of cations. In fact, the partition of
ions inside the mutant channels is strongly inhomogeneous, with regions
containing excess of cations and regions containing excess of anions.
Interestingly, the overall number of cations inside the channel is larger than
the number of anions in the two mutants, as in the OmpF wild type channel. We
found that the differences in ionic charge inside these channels are justified
by the differences in electric charge between the wild type OmpF and the
mutants, following an electroneutral balance.

Hopf bifurcation when they are submitted to an external forcing that is
periodic in time, at a frequency close to the system's natural frequency (1:1
resonance), and whose amplitude is slowly modulated in space. Starting from a
general, unspecified model and making use of standard multiple scales analysis,
I show that the close-to-threshold dynamics of such systems is universally
governed by a generalized, complex Ginzburg-Landau (CGL) equation. The nature
of the generalization depends on the strength and of other features of forcing:
(i) For generic, sufficiently weak forcings the CGL equation contains an extra,
inhomogeneous term proportional to the complex amplitude of forcing, as in the
usual 1:1 resonance with spatially uniform forcing; (ii) For stronger
perturbations, whose amplitude sign alternates across the system, the CGL
equation contains a term proportional to the complex conjugate of the
oscillations envelope, like in the classical 2:1 resonance, responsible for the
emergence of phase bistability and of phase bistable patterns in the system.
Finally I show that case (ii) is retrieved from case (i) in the appropriate
limit so that the latter can be regarded as the generic model for the
close-to-threshold dynamics of the type of systems considered here. The kind of
forcing studied in this work thus represents an alternative to the classical
parametric forcing at twice the natural frequency of oscillations and opens the
way to new forms of pattern formation control in self-oscillatory systems, what
is especially relevant in the case of systems that are quite insensitive to
parametric forcing, such as lasers and other nonlinear optical cavities.

Accepted for publication in Icarus",,"10.1016/j.icarus.2010.05.030",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We investigate the long-term and large-scale viscous evolution of dense
planetary rings using a simple 1D numerical code. We use a physically realistic
viscosity model derived from N-body simulations (Daisaka et al., 2001), and
dependent on the disk's local properties (surface mass density, particle size,
distance to the planet). Particularly, we include the effects of gravitational
instabilities (wakes) that importantly enhance the disk's viscosity. We show
that common estimates of the disk's spreading time-scales with constant
viscosity significantly underestimate the rings' lifetime. With a realistic
viscosity model, an initially narrow ring undergoes two successive evolutionary
stages: (1) a transient rapid spreading when the disk is self-gravitating, with
the formation of a density peak inward and an outer region marginally
gravitationally stable, and with an emptying time-scale proportional to 1/M_0^2
(where M_0 is the disk's initial mass) (2) an asymptotic regime where the
spreading rate continuously slows down as larger parts of the disk become
not-self-gravitating due to the decrease of the surface density, until the disk
becomes completely not-self-gravitating. At this point its evolution
dramatically slows down, with an emptying time-scale proportional to 1/M_0,
which significantly increases the disk's lifetime compared to the case with
constant viscosity. We show also that the disk's width scales like t^{1/4} with
the realistic viscosity model, while it scales like t^{1/2} in the case of
constant viscosity, resulting in much larger evolutionary time-scales in our
model. We find however that the present shape of Saturn's rings looks like a
100 million-years old disk in our simulations. Concerning Jupiter's, Uranus'
and Neptune's rings that are faint today, it is not likely that they were much
more massive in the past and lost most of their mass due to viscous spreading
alone.

of \sqrt{s}_{min}, however, the connection to the new physics mass scale was
blurred by the effects of the underlying event, most notably initial state
radiation and multiple parton interactions. In this paper we advertize two
improved variants of the \sqrt{s}_{min} variable, which overcome this problem.
First we show that by evaluating the \sqrt{s}_{min} variable at the RECO level,
in terms of the reconstructed objects in the event, the effects from the
underlying event are significantly diminished and the nice correlation between
the peak in the \sqrt{s}_{min}^{(reco)} distribution and the new physics mass
scale is restored. Secondly, the underlying event problem can be avoided
altogether when the \sqrt{s}_{min} concept is applied to a subsystem of the
event which does not involve any QCD jets. We supply an analytic formula for
the resulting subsystem \sqrt{s}_{min}^{(sub)} variable and show that its peak
exhibits the usual correlation with the mass scale of the particles produced in
the subsystem. Finally, we contrast \sqrt{s}_{min} to other popular inclusive
variables such as H_T, M_{Tgen} and M_{TTgen}. We illustrate our discussion

(quarks and gluons) computed from Hard-Thermal-Loop techniques, in which the
standard two-loop running coupling constant is used. Our model is minimal in
the sense that we do not allow any extra ansatz concerning the
temperature-dependence of the running coupling. We first show that it is able
to reproduce the most recent equations of state computed on the lattice for
temperatures higher than 2 $T_c$. In this range of temperatures, an ideal gas
framework is indeed expected to be relevant. Then we study the accuracy of
various inequivalent large-$N_c$ limits concerning the description of the QCD
results, as well as the equivalence between the QCD$_{AS}$ limit and the ${\cal

the well with a porous medium. That medium consists of countless small, dense,

exoplanetary systems with one or more planets that have been observed in
transit, to estimate each system's present habitability. The measured stellar
properties have been used to determine the present location of the classical
habitable zone (HZ). To establish habitability we use the estimated distances
from the giant planet(s) within which an Earth-like planet would be inside the
gravitational reach of the giant. Of the 79 transiting systems known in April
2010, only 2 do not offer safe havens to Earth-like planets in the HZ, and thus
could not support life today. We have also estimated whether habitability is
possible for 1.7 Gyr into the past i.e. 0.7 Gyr for a heavy bombardment, plus
1.0 Gyr for life to emerge and thus be present today. We find that, for the
best estimate of each stellar age, an additional 28 systems do not offer such
sustained habitability. If we reduce 1.7 Gyr to 1.0 Gyr this number falls to
22. However, if giant planets orbiting closer to the star than the inner
boundary of the HZ, have got there by migration through the HZ, and if this
ruled out the subsequent formation of Earth-like planets, then, of course, none
of the presently known transiting exoplanetary systems offers habitability.
Fortunately, this bleak conclusion could well be wrong. As well as obtaining
results on the 79 transiting systems, this paper demonstrates a method for
determining the habitability of the cornucopia of such systems that will surely
be discovered over the next few years.

1-form. Several features of the reasoning are interesting: The use of exterior
calculus for Lipschitz-continuous forms, that the arguments for geodesic flows
and infranilmanifoldautomorphisms are quite different, and the need for mixing
as opposed to ergodicity in the latter case.

Laboratory, the former Homestake mine, in South Dakota to study the properties

possible advantages of constructing a third-generation gravitational-wave
detector underground. Seismic data were analyzed to characterize seismic noise
and disturbances. External databases were used to identify sources of seismic
waves: ocean-wave data to identify sources of oceanic microseisms, and surface
wind-speed data to investigate correlations with seismic motion as a function
of depth. In addition, sources of events contributing to the spectrum at higher
frequencies are characterized by studying the variation of event rates over the
course of a day. Long-term observations of spectral variations provide further
insight into the nature of seismic sources. Seismic spectra at three different
depths are compared, establishing the 4100-ft level as a world-class low
seismic-noise environment.

$I_{4}^D$ are known at $()_4 \equiv 0$, so that we may extend the numerics to
small, non-vanishing $()_4$ by applying a dimensional recurrence relation. A
numerical example is worked out. Together with a recursive reduction of 6- and
5-point functions, derived earlier, the calculational scheme allows a
stabilized reduction of $n$-point functions with $n\leq 6$ at arbitrary phase

the now-infamous ""No. 1"" blue ink mark on the torpedo, and the
electron-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and x-ray data of the three ""adsorbed
materials"" extracted from the ship, the torpedo and a small-scale
test-explosion. In our previous paper [2], we described the inconsistency of
JIG's EDS and x-ray diffraction (XRD) data. Here we report our SEM, EDS, and
x-ray experiments on an Al powder that underwent melting followed by rapid
quenching, and our simulation of the EDS spectra of Al2O3 and Al(OH)3. We
obtained an experimental value of 0.25 for the EDS intensity ratio, I(O)/I(Al),
and a simulation result of I(O)/I(Al) ~ 0.23 for Al2O3 formed on the surface of
the adsorbed materials during an explosion. The JIG's EDS data, however, showed
very different values of ~ 0.9 for the same ratio. Interestingly, the high
value of ~ 0.9 is expected for ""rusted"" aluminum, such as Al(OH)3, that can be
formed by exposing Al to moisture or water. Our results indicate that the JIG's
adsorbed materials taken from the ship and torpedo are not associated with any
explosion, and that the JIG's EDS data of their test-explosion sample are most
likely fabricated. Until the South Korean Joint Investigation Group (JIG) can
convince the international scientific communities the validity of their data,
their official conclusion that the torpedo sank the Cheonan ship should be
discarded.

show that the production cross section in the threshold limit can be factorized
into a convolution of hard function, soft function and jet function via
soft-collinear-effective-theory (SCET), and resummation can be performed using
renormalization group equation in the momentum space resummation formalism. We
find that in general, the resummation effects enhance the Next-to-Leading-Order
(NLO) cross sections by about $3%-5%$ at both the Tevatron and the LHC, and
significantly reduce the factorization scale dependence of the total cross
section at the Tevatron, while at the LHC we find that the factorization scale
dependence has not been improved, compared with the NLO results.

with smaller size and very different shapes. We consider the Schrodinger
equation which is valid e.g. in the contexts of geometrical and quantum optics.
More precisely, we introduce a generalized non-singular transformation for star
domains, and numerically demonstrate that an object of nearly any given shape
surrounded by a given cloak scatters waves in exactly the same way as a smaller
object of another shape. When a source is located inside the cloak, it scatters
waves as if it would be located some distance away from a small object.
Moreover, the invisibility region actually hosts almost-trapped eigenstates.
Mimetism is numerically shown to break down for the quantified energies
associated with confined modes. If we further allow for non-isomorphic
transformations, our approach leads to the design of quantum super-scatterers:
a small size object surrounded by a quantum cloak described by a negative
anisotropic heterogeneous effective mass and a negative spatially varying
potential scatters matter waves like a larger nano-object of different shape.
Potential applications might be for instance in quantum dots probing.

For a broad range of concentrations, we find that the anisotropic, yet normal

parallel and perpendicular to the field at sufficiently high dipolar coupling
and field strength. After the ballistic regime, chain formation first yields
cage-like motion in all directions, followed by transient, mixed
diffusive-superdiffusive behavior resulting from cooperative motion of the
chains. The enhanced dynamics disappears only at higher densities close to
