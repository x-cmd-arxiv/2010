tracking uncertainty, and states of ""knowledge available"" vs. ""knowledge
missing,"" to better practice innovation, improve risk management, and
successfully measure progress of intractable undertakings. Shannon's formula,
and its common replacements (Renyi, Tsallis) compute to increased knowledge
whenever two competing choices, however marginal, exchange probability
measures. Such and other distortions are corrected by anchoring knowledge to a
reference challenge. Entropy then expresses progress towards meeting that
challenge. We introduce an 'interval of interest' outside which all probability
changes should be ignored. The resultant formula for Missing Acquirable
Relevant Knowledge (MARK) serves as a means to optimize intractable activities
involving knowledge acquisition, such as research, development, risk
management, and opportunity exploitation.

maximal spin could act as a particle collider with arbitrarily high
center-of-mass energy. In this paper, we will extend the result to the charged
spinning black hole, the Kerr-Newman black hole. The center-of-mass energy of
collision for two uncharged particles falling freely from rest at infinity
depends not only on the spin $a$ but also on the charge $Q$ of the black hole.
We find that an unlimited center-of-mass energy can be approached with the
conditions: (1) the collision takes place at the horizon of an extremal black
hole; (2) one of the colliding particles has critical angular momentum; (3) the
spin $a$ of the extremal black hole satisfies $\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\leq
\frac{a}{M}\leq 1$, where $M$ is the mass of the Kerr-Newman black hole. The
third condition implies that to obtain an arbitrarily high energy, the extremal
Kerr-Newman black hole must have a large value of spin, which is a significant
difference between the Kerr and Kerr-Newman black holes. Furthermore, we also
show that, for a near-extremal black hole, there always exists a finite upper
bound for center-of-mass energy, which decreases with the increase of the
charge $Q$.

complementary tools. Dark currents (IVs) are well described by series and
parallel resistances, and two dominant recombination mechanisms represented by
parallel diodes. Measurements of IV as a function of temperature (IVT) allow
extraction of activation energies corresponding to these processes and indicate
their spatial position. Admittance spectroscopy (AS) gives an independent
estimate of the same energies, and yields values of the defect densities of
states in the forbidden gap. Two dominant levels are apparent, confirming the
validity of the IV analysis. Spectral response (QE) measurements are presented,
yielding information on minority carrier collection efficiency. The different
methods of parameter extraction are correlated and indicate recombination
levels some hundreds of meV above the valence band and below the conduction
band. Bias dependence of admittance spectroscopy gives indications on the
localisation of defect centres with one defect situated at the CdS
heterointerface and the other in the bulk of the depletion region. The dark
current analysis indicates that photogenerated minority carrier collection is
the limiting factor in these cells at the operating bias.

phenomenological equations containing a stochastic force, the best known
example being the Langevin equation (LE) for the Brownian motion (BM) of
particles. Long ago Vladimirsky (1942) proposed a simple method for solving
such equations. The method, based on the classical Gibbs statistics, consists
in converting the stochastic LE into a deterministic one, and is applicable to
linear equations with any kind of memory. When the memory effects are taken
into account in the description of the BM, the mean square displacement of the
particle at long times can exhibit an ""anomalous"" (different from that in the
Einstein theory) time dependence. In the present paper we show how some general
properties of such anomalous BM can be easily derived using the Vladimirsky
approach. The method can be effectively used in solving many of the problems
currently considered in the literature. We apply it to the description of the
BM when the memory kernel in the Volterra-type integro-differential LE
exponentially decreases with the time. The problem of the hydrodynamic BM of a
charged particle in an external magnetic field is also solved.

V458 Vul is therefore the planetary nebula central binary star with the

of a relatively massive white dwarf (M1 \gsim 1.0 Msun) accreting matter from a
post-asymptotic giant branch star which produced the planetary nebula observed.
In this scenario, the central binary system therefore underwent two
common-envelope episodes. A combination of previous photoionisation modelling
of the nebular spectra, post-asymptotic giant branch evolutionary tracks and
the orbital period favour a mass of M2 \sim 0.6 Msun for the donor star.
Therefore, the total mass of the system may exceed the Chandrasekhar mass,

produced equations that hold on certain loci of the Jacobian of a cyclic

equations in question are given in terms of (Klein's) generalization of
Weierstrass' $\sigma$-function. The key tool is a matrix with entries that are
polynomial in the coordinates of the affine plane model of the curve, thus can
be expressed in terms of $\sigma$ and its derivatives. The key geometric loci
on the Jacobian of the curve give a stratification of Brill-Noether type. The
results are of the type of Riemann-Kempf singularity theorem, the methods are
germane to those used by J.D. Fay, who gave vanishing tables for Riemann's
$\theta$-function and its derivatives. The main objects we use were developed
by several contemporary authors, aside from the classical definitions:
meromorphic differentials were expressed in terms of the coordinates mainly by
V.M. Buchstaber, J.C. Eilbeck, V.Z. Enolski, D.V. Leykin, and Taylor expansions
for $\sigma$ in terms of Schur polynomials also contributed by A. Nakayashiki,
in terms of Sato's $\tau$-function. Within this framework, following specific
results for $\sigma$-derivatives given by Y. \^Onishi, we arrive at our main
results, namely statements on the vanishing on given strata of the partial
derivatives of $\sigma$ indexed by Young-diagrams subsets that can be worked
out in terms of the Weierstrass semigroup of the curve at its point at
infinity. The combinatorial statements hold not only for Jacobians but for the
stratification of Sato's infinite-dimensional Grassmann manifold as well.

locally superluminal refractive index perturbation (RIP) in a Kerr medium can
be described, in the eikonal approximation, by means of a stationary metric,
which we prove to be of Gordon type. Under suitable hypotheses on the RIP, we
obtain a stationary but not static metric, which is characterized by an
ergosphere and by a peculiar behaviour of the geodesics, which are studied
numerically, also accounting for material dispersion. Finally, the equation to
be satisfied by an event horizon is also displayed and briefly discussed.

The calculation of the relevant hard-scattering kernels is completed, the

""chirally-enhanced"" terms, vertex corrections and weak annihilation
contributions with non-trivial strong phase. With these considerations,
predictions are presented for the branching ratios and CP asymmetries of

polarization observables in VV final states. Several decay modes and
observables, which are of particular interest phenomenologically, are discussed
in detail, including the effect of annihilation amplitude with strong phase,
the $\pi\pi$, $\pi K$ and $\pi \rho$ systems, the longitudinal polarization
fraction $f_L$ in $\rho K^*$ and $\phi K^*$ systems and so on. It is observed

equations endowed with a strictly convex mathematical entropy, we formulate the
initial value problem by supplementing the equations with a kinetic relation
prescribing the rate of entropy dissipation across shock waves. Our condition
can be regarded as a generalization to nonconservative systems of a similar
concept introduced by Abeyaratne, Knowles, and Truskinovsky for subsonic phase
transitions and by LeFloch for nonclassical undercompressive shocks to
nonlinear hyperbolic systems. The proposed kinetic relation for nonconservative
systems turns out to be equivalent, for the class of systems under
consideration at least, to Dal Maso, LeFloch, and Murat's definition based on a
prescribed family of Lipschitz continuous paths. In agreement with previous
theories, the kinetic relation should be derived from a phase plane analysis of
traveling solutions associated with an augmented version of the nonconservative
system. We illustrate with several examples that nonconservative systems
arising in the applications fit in our framework, and for a typical model of
turbulent fluid dynamics, we provide a detailed analysis of the existence and
properties of traveling waves which yields the corresponding kinetic function.

The torsional stress related with supercoiling may be also involved in gene
regulation through the local structure and dynamics of the double helix. To
check this possibility steady torsional stress was applied to DNA in the course
of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. It is found that small static
untwisting significantly reduces the torsional persistence length ($l_t$) of
GC-alternating DNA. For the AT-alternating sequence a smaller effect of the
opposite sign is observed. As a result, the measured $l_t$ values are similar
under zero stress, but diverge with untwisting. The effect is traced to
sequence-specific asymmetry of local torsional fluctuations, and it should be
small in long random DNA due to compensation. In contrast, the stiffness of
special short sequences can vary significantly, which gives a simple
possibility of gene regulation via probabilities of strong fluctuations. These
results have important implications for the role of local DNA twisting in
complexes with transcription factors.

superconductors, is studied by angleresolved photoemission spectroscopy. By
examining its dependence on photon energy, polarization, sodium dosing and the
counting of Fermi surface volume, both the bulk and the surface contributions
are identified. We find that a bulk band moves toward high binding energies
below structural transition, and shifts smoothly across the spin density wave
transition by about 25 meV. Our data suggest the band reconstruction may play a
crucial role in the spin density wave transition, and the structural transition
is driven by the short range magnetic order. For the surface states, both the
LaO-terminated and FeAs-terminated components are revealed. Certain small band
shifts are verified for the FeAs-terminated surface states in the spin density
wave state, which is a reflection of the bulk electronic structure
reconstruction. Moreover, sharp quasiparticle peaks quickly rise at low
temperatures, indicating of drastic reduction of the scattering rate. A kink
structure in one of the surface band is shown to be possibly related to the
electron-phonon interactions.
