anomaly. In order to describe a continuum quantum field theory of Dirac
fermions, lattice actions with purported exact chiral symmetry must break the
flavor-singlet axial symmetry. We demonstrate that this is indeed the case by
using a minimally doubled fermion action. For simplicity we consider the
Abelian axial anomaly in two dimensions. At finite lattice spacing and with
gauge interactions, the axial anomaly arises from non-conservation of the
flavor-singlet current. Similar non-conservation also leads to the axial
anomaly in the case of the naive lattice action. For minimally doubled actions,
however, fine tuning of the action and axial current is necessary to arrive at
the anomaly. Conservation of the flavor non-singlet vector current additionally
requires the current to be fine tuned. Finally we determine that the chiral
projection of a minimally doubled fermion action can be used to arrive at a
lattice theory with an undoubled Dirac fermion possessing the correct anomaly
in the continuum limit.

taking account of the particle size effect. The velocity, pressure gradient,

we already know that these perturbations evolve according to a relativistic
Klein-Gordon equation in the long wavelength approximation. For shorter
wavelengths, we show that this equation acquires nontrivial corrections which
modify the Klein-Gordon product. In this approach, quasiparticles can also be
defined (up to the standard ambiguities due to observer-dependence). We
demonstrate that---in the low as well as in the high energy regimes---both
concepts of quasiparticle are actually the same, regardless of the formalism
(Bogolubov or Klein-Gordon) used to describe them. These results also apply to
any barotropic, inviscid, irrotational fluid, with or without quantum
potential. Finally, we illustrate how the quantization of these systems of
quasiparticles proceeds by analyzing a stationary configuration containing an
acoustic horizon. We show that there are several possible choices of a regular
vacuum state, including a regular generalization of the Boulware vacuum. Issues
such us Hawking radiation crucially depend on this vacuum choice.

double-lined spectroscopic binary system UX Ari, IUE spectra (194 images) were
taken from the IUE archive. The spectra, obtained during the period 1978-1996,
show emission lines originating in the chromosphere and transition region. The
long-wavelength low dispersion spectra were examined for ultraviolet excess by
comparing the UV continuum level of UX Ari with the levels of $\kappa$ Cet and
$\eta$ Cep in the spectral range 2100 $\AA$ - 3200 $\AA$ . The individual MgII
h and k emission-line fluxes of component stars show that the contributions to
the activity of the system for G5 V and K0 IV are about 20% and 80%,
respectively. Apart from the flare event observed on 1979 Jan 1, there are some
flux enhancements in the years 1987, 1991 and 1994 which may suggest existence
of a periodicity of about 7-9 years. Examination of the ultraviolet excess in
the system showed that there is some UV excess in UX Ari, which varies from 1%
up to 24% with the exception of two images which showed no UV excess. The
results revealed that there was an agreement on the source of emission regions
which could be attributed to the magnetic activity. The contribution of G5 V
and K0 IV components to the MgII activity of the system suggests a need to take
into consideration the spot distribution not only on the surface of K0 IV but
also on the surface of G5 V component of UX Ari.

to small and arbitrary CKM mixing angles. Supersymmetry is not essential for

the same family symmetry solves the SUSY flavor problem.

dot with spin-orbit coupling. Exact calculation are combined with a simple
model to provide an intuitive and accurate description of single-particle and

two-electron ground state is antisymmetric in the spin-valley degree of freedom
and is not a pure spin-singlet state. When double occupation of one dot is
favored by increasing the detuning between the dots, the Coulomb interaction
causes strong correlation effects realized by higher orbital-level mixing.
Changes in the double-dot configuration affect the relative strength of the
electron-electron interactions and can lead to different ground state
transitions. In particular, they can favor a ferromagnetic ground state both in
spin and valley degrees of freedom. The strong suppression of the energy gap
can cause the disappearance of the Pauli blockade in transport experiments and
thereby can also limit the stability of spin-qubits in quantum information
proposals. Our analysis is generalized to an array of coupled dots which is

observations of NGC7129 FIRS2, an intermediate mass star-forming region. We
attempt to interpret the observations in the framework of an in-falling
spherical envelope. Methods: The PACS instrument was used in line spectroscopy
mode (R=1000-5000) with 15 spectral bands between 63 and 185 microns. This
provided good detections of 26 spectral lines seen in emission, including lines
of H2O, CO, OH, O I, and C II. Results: Most of the detected lines,
particularly those of H2O and CO, are substantially stronger than predicted by
the spherical envelope models, typically by several orders of magnitude. In
this paper we focus on what can be learned from the detected CO emission lines.
Conclusions: It is unlikely that the much stronger than expected line emission
arises in the (spherical) envelope of the YSO. The region hot enough to produce
such high excitation lines within such an envelope is too small to produce the
amount of emission observed. Virtually all of this high excitation emission
must arise in structures such as as along the walls of the outflow cavity with
the emission produced by a combination of UV photon heating and/or
non-dissociative shocks.

Abel-Plana summation formula, we explicitly extract form the expectation values
the contribution associated with purely de Sitter space, remaining the
expectation values induced by the cosmic string. The latter presents
information about de Sitter gravity as well. Because the investigation of the
fermionic quantum fluctuations in de Sitter space have been investigated in
literature, here we are mainly interested in the cosmic string-induced
contributions. For a massless field, the fermionic condensate vanishes and the
presence of the string does not break chiral symmetry of the massless theory.
Unlike to the case of a scalar field, for a massive fermionic field the vacuum
expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor is diagonal and the axial and
radial stresses are equal to the energy density. At large distances from the
string the behavior of the string-induced parts in the vacuum densities is
damping oscillatory with the amplitude decaying as the inverse fourth power of
the distance. This is in contrast to the case of flat spacetime, in which the
string-induced vacuum densities for a massive field decay exponentially with
distance from the string. In the limit of the large curvature radius of de
Sitter space we recover the results for a cosmic string in flat spacetime.

long been an enigma. The recent measurements of large offsets (~100 km/s)
between the heliocentric radial velocities of some very massive (O2-type) field
stars and the systemic LMC velocity provides a possible explanation of this
enigma and suggests that the field stars are runaway stars ejected from their
birth places at the very beginning of their parent cluster's dynamical
evolution. A straightforward way to prove this explanation is to measure the
proper motions of the field stars and to show that they are moving away from
one of the nearby star clusters or OB associations. This approach however is
complicated by the large distance to the LMC, which makes accurate proper
motion measurements difficult. We use an alternative approach for solving the
problem, based on the search for bow shocks produced by runaway stars. The
geometry of detected bow shocks would allow us to infer the direction of
stellar motion and thereby to determine their possible parent clusters. In this
paper we present the results of a search for bow shocks around six massive
field stars which were suggested in the literature as candidate runaway stars.
Using archival (Spitzer Space Telescope) data, we found a bow shock associated
with one of our program stars, the O2 V((f*)) star BI 237, which is the
first-ever detection of bow shocks in the LMC. Orientation of the bow shock
suggests that BI 237 was ejected from the OB association LH 82 (located at ~120
pc in projection from the star). A by-product of our search is the detection of
bow shocks generated by four OB stars in the field of the LMC and an arc-like
structure attached to the candidate luminous blue variable R81 (HD 269128). The
geometry of two of these bow shocks is consistent with the possibility that
their associated stars were ejected from the 30 Doradus star forming complex.

velocity, with a dynamical recipe for the rotation curve, rather than a simple
conversion from the total mass to maximum velocity. The new recipe takes into
account the disk shape factor, and the angular momentum transfer occurring
during secular evolution leading to the formation of bulges. This produces
model rotation velocities that are lower by ~20-25% for the majority of the
spirals. We implemented stellar population models with a complete treatment of
the TP-AGB, which leads to a revision of the mass-to-light ratio in the
near-IR. I/K band luminosities increase by ~0.3/0.5 mags at redshift z=0 and by
~0.5/1 mags at z=3. With these two new recipes in place, the comparison between
the predicted Tully-Fisher relation with a series of datasets in the optical
and near-IR, at redshifts between 0 and 1, is used as a diagnostics of the
assembly and evolution of spiral galaxies in the model. At 0.4<z<1.2 the match
between the new model and data is remarkably good, especially for later-type
spirals (Sb/Sc). At z=0 the new model shows a net improvement in comparison
with its original version of 2003, and in accord with recent observations in
the K band, the model Tully-Fisher also shows a morphological differentiation.
However, in all bands the z=0 model Tully-Fisher is too bright. We argue that
this behaviour is caused by inadequate star formation histories in the model
galaxies at low redshifts. The star-formation rate declines too slowly, due to
continuous gas infall that is not efficiently suppressed. An analysis of the
model disk scale lengths, at odds with observations, hints to some missing
physics in the modeling of disk formation inside dark matter halos.

By carrying out magnetoconvection simulations with a radiation-hydro code (the
Copenhagen stagger code) and through a-posteriori spectral synthesis of three
Fe I lines, we obtain evidence that moderate amounts of mean magnetic flux
cause a noticeable change in the derived equivalent widths compared with those
for a non-magnetic case. The corresponding Fe abundance correction for a mean
flux density of 200 G reaches up to ~0.1 dex in magnitude. These results are
based on space- and time-averaged line profiles over a time span of 2.5 solar
hours in the statistically stationary regime of the convection. The main
factors causing the change in equivalent widths, namely the Zeeman broadening
and the modification of the temperature stratification, act in different
amounts and, for the iron lines considered here, in opposite directions; yet,
the resulting $|\Delta\log\epsilon_{\odot}(Fe)|$ coincides within a factor two
in all of them, even though the sign of the total abundance correction is
different for the visible and infrared lines. We conclude that magnetic effects
should be taken into account when discussing precise values of the solar and
stellar abundances and that an extended study is warranted.

  ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD)",,,,"cs.DS cs.SI physics.soc-ph stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Information diffusion and virus propagation are fundamental processes taking
place in networks. While it is often possible to directly observe when nodes
become infected with a virus or adopt the information, observing individual
transmissions (i.e., who infects whom, or who influences whom) is typically
very difficult. Furthermore, in many applications, the underlying network over
which the diffusions and propagations spread is actually unobserved. We tackle
these challenges by developing a method for tracing paths of diffusion and
influence through networks and inferring the networks over which contagions
propagate. Given the times when nodes adopt pieces of information or become
infected, we identify the optimal network that best explains the observed
infection times. Since the optimization problem is NP-hard to solve exactly, we
develop an efficient approximation algorithm that scales to large datasets and
finds provably near-optimal networks.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by tracing information
diffusion in a set of 170 million blogs and news articles over a one year
period to infer how information flows through the online media space. We find
that the diffusion network of news for the top 1,000 media sites and blogs
tends to have a core-periphery structure with a small set of core media sites
that diffuse information to the rest of the Web. These sites tend to have
stable circles of influence with more general news media sites acting as
connectors between them.

  RhV","22 pages, 7 figures",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Both IrV and RhV crystallize in the alpha-IrV structure, with a transition to
the higher symmetry L1_0 structure at high temperature, or with the addition of
excess Ir or Rh. Here we present evidence that this transition is driven by the
lowering of the electronic density of states at the Fermi level of the
alpha-IrV structure. The transition has long been thought to be second order,
with a simple doubling of the L1_0 unit cell due to an unstable phonon at the R
point (0 1/2 1/2). We use first-principles calculations to show that all
phonons at the R point are, in fact, stable, but do find a region of reciprocal
space where the L1_0 structure has unstable (imaginary frequency) phonons. We
use the frozen phonon method to examine two of these modes, relaxing the
structures associated with the unstable phonon modes to obtain new structures
which are lower in energy than L1_0 but still above alpha-IrV. We examine the
phonon spectra of these structures as well, looking for instabilities, and find
further instabilities, and more relaxed structures, all of which have energies
above the alpha-IrV phase. In addition, we find that all of the relaxed
structures, stable and unstable, have a density comparable to the L1_0 phase
(and less than the alpha-IrV phase), so that any transition from one of these
structures to the ground state will have a volume change as well as an energy
discontinuity. We conclude that the transition from L1_0 to alpha-IrV is
probably weakly first order.

We fit combinations of stellar population synthesis models and power laws to

distributions to separate stellar emission from non-stellar near-IR continuum.
By separating the stellar emission from the non-stellar near-IR continuum, we
find that ~ 50% of our sample have non-stellar continuum contributions of less
than 10% in rest-frame H-band, but ~ 10% of our sample have non-stellar

non-stellar continuum emission is correlated with hard X-ray luminosity,
indicating an AGN origin of the emission. Upon subtracting this AGN-contributed
continuum component from all of the galaxies in our sample, we determine a
lower median stellar mass for SMGs than previous studies, ~ 7 x 10^10 M_sun. We
use constraints of the starburst time-scale from molecular gas studies to
estimate the amount of fading our sample would undergo if they passively evolve

protocols have been proposed to enable concurrent communications and improve

assumptions about the underlying physical layer as well as some aspects of the
link adaptation protocol. The result is that the performance predicted by such
works may not necessarily be a good predictor of actual performance in a fully

concept that would allow us to better predict their performance under realistic
operating conditions. Using a generic SDMA-MAC we look at how the network sum
throughput changes with the introduction of the following: $(a)$ use of the
more practical MMSE algorithm instead of the zero-forcing or SVD based nulling
algorithms used for receive beamnulling; $(b)$ impact of channel estimation
errors; $(c)$ introduction of link adaptation mechanism specifically designed
for concurrent SDMA MACs; $(d)$ incorporation of TX beamforming along with RX
beamnulling. Following on the transmission window during which concurrent
transmissions are allowed by the MAC, we qualify the impact of each of these

incorporates elements $a-d$ is presented and compared against the baseline

massive star still in the main accretion phase. It is thus one of the best
cases for studying the properties of massive protostars to constrain high-mass
star formation theories. Near-infrared radiation from source I escapes through
the cavity opened by the OMC1 outflow and is scattered by dust towards our line
of sight. The reflected spectrum offers a unique possibility of observing the
emission from the innermost regions of the system and probing the nature of
source I and its immediate surroundings. We obtained moderately high
spectral-resolution (R~9000) observations of the near-infrared diffuse emission
in several locations around source I/Orion-KL. We observed a widespread rich
absorption line spectrum that we compare with cool stellar photospheres and
protostellar accretion disk models. The spectrum is broadly similar to strongly
veiled, cool, low-gravity stellar photospheres in the range Teff~3500-4500 K,
luminosity class I-III. An exact match explaining all features has not been
found, and a plausible explanation is that a range of different temperatures
contribute to the observed absorption spectrum. The 1D velocity dispersions
implied by the absorption spectra, sigma~30 km/s, can be explained by the
emission from a disk around a massive, mstar~10 Msun, protostar that is
accreting at a high rate, mdot~3x10^{-3} Msun/yr. Our observations suggest that
the near-infrared reflection spectrum observed in the Orion-KL region is
produced close to source I and scattered to our line of sight in the OMC1
outflow cavity. The spectrum allows us to exclude source I being a very large,
massive protostar rotating at breakup speed. We suggest that the absorption
spectrum is produced in a disk surrounding a ~10 Msun protostar, accreting from
its disk at a high rate of a few 10^{-3} Msun/yr.

late-type stars to show whether the systematic abundance discrepancy between Cr
I and Cr II lines, as often encountered in the literature, is due to deviations
from LTE. Furthermore, we attempt to interpret the NLTE trend of [Cr/Fe] with
[Fe/H] using chemical evolution models for the solar neighborhood. Methods.
NLTE calculations are performed for the model of Cr atom, comprising 340 levels
and 6806 transitions in total. We make use of the quantum-mechanical
photoionization cross-sections of Nahar (2009) and investigate sensitivity of
the model to uncertain cross-sections for H I collisions. NLTE line formation
is performed for the MAFAGS-ODF model atmospheres of the Sun and 10 metal-poor
stars with -3.2 < [Fe/H] < -0.5, and abundances of Cr are derived by comparison
of the synthetic and observed flux spectra. Results. We achieve good ionization
equilibrium of Cr for the models with different stellar parameters, if
inelastic collisions with H I atoms are neglected. The solar NLTE abundance
based on Cr I lines is 5.74 dex with {\sigma} = 0.05 dex; it is \sim 0.1 higher
than the LTE abundance. For the metal-poor stars, the NLTE abundance
corrections to Cr I lines range from +0.3 to +0.5 dex. The resulting [Cr/Fe]
ratio is roughly solar for the range of metallicities analyzed here, which is
consistent with current views on production of these iron peak elements in
supernovae. Conclusions. The tendency of Cr to become deficient with respect to
Fe in metal-poor stars is an artifact due to neglect of NLTE effects in the
line formation of Cr I, and it has no relation to peculiar physical conditions
in the Galactic ISM or deficiencies of nucleosynthesis theory.

$\yim$ and $\ysm$ and use this correlation to eliminate uncertainties in $\yim$

find an expression for $\yim$ that depends only on $\ysm$ and the diffusion
rate. By adopting the helioseismic determination of solar surface helium
abundance, $\ysms= 0.2485\pm0.0035$, and an uncertainty of 20% for the

$0.278 \pm 0.006$ independently of the reference standard solar models (and
particularly on adopted the solar abundances) used in the derivation of the

provided their number is large enough, both at zero and finite temperatures.
Since Higgs vacuum expectation value (VEV) is significantly modified inside
them, they are called ""bags"". In this work we argue that creation of such
objects can explain certain numerical studies of cosmological baryogenesis.
Using as an example a hybrid model, combining inflationary preheating with cold
electroweak transition, we identify ""spots of unbroken phase"" found in
numerical studies of this scenario with such $W-Z$ bags. We argue that the
baryon number violation should happen predominantly inside these objects, and
show that the rates calculated in numerical simulations can be analytically
explained using finite-size pure gauge sphaleron solutions, developed
previously in the QCD context by Carter, Ostrovsky and Shuryak (COS).
Furthermore, we point out significant presence of the top quarks/antiquarks in
these bag (which were not included in those numerical studies). Although the
basic sphaleron exponent remains unchanged by the top's presence, we find that
tops help to stabilize them for a longer time. Another enhancement of the
transition rate comes from the ""recycling"" of the tops in the topological
transition. Inclusion of the fermions (tops) enhances the sphaleron rate by up
to 2 orders of magnitude. We finally discuss the magnitude of the CP violation
needed to explain the observed baryonic asymmetry of the Universe, and give
arguments that the difference in the top-antitop population in the bag of the
right magnitude can arise both from CP asymmetries in the top decays and in top
propagation into the bags, due to Farrar-Shaposhnikov effect.

weighted differential reproduction within a population of replicas to sample
equilibrium states. Population annealing gives direct access to the free
energy. It is shown that unbiased measurements of observables can be obtained
by weighted averages over many runs with weight factors related to the free

parallelization and may be a useful alternative to parallel tempering for
systems with rough free energy landscapes such as spin glasses. The method is

typical collisional plasma found in galactic interstellar media or the
intergalactic medium. The spectrum emitted by this plasma contains diagnostics
that have been used to determine the time since the disturbing event, although
this determination becomes uncertain as the elements in the plasma return to
ionization equilibrium. A general solution for the equilibrium timescale for
each element arises from the elegant eigenvector method of solution to the
problem of a non-equilibrium plasma described by Masai (1984) and Hughes &
Helfand (1985). In general the ionization evolution of an element Z in a
constant electron temperature plasma is given by a coupled set of Z+1 first
order differential equations. However, they can be recast as Z uncoupled first
order differential equations using an eigenvector basis for the system. The
solution is then Z separate exponential functions, with the time constants
given by the eigenvalues of the rate matrix. The smallest of these eigenvalues
gives the scale of slowest return to equilibrium independent of the initial
conditions, while conversely the largest eigenvalue is the scale of the fastest
change in the ion population. These results hold for an ionizing plasma, a
recombining plasma, or even a plasma with random initial conditions, and will
allow users of these diagnostics to determine directly if their best-fit result
significantly limits the timescale since a disturbance or is so close to
equilibrium as to include an arbitrarily-long time.

beams with energy up to 52 MeV from pion and muon decay-at-rest. The experiment
searches for aninu_mu to antinu_e at short baselines corresponding to the
atmospheric Delta m^2 region. The antinu_e will be detected, via inverse beta
decay, in the 300 kton fiducial-volume Gd-doped water Cherenkov neutrino

high-statistics, low-background alternative for CP violation searches which
matches the capability of the conventional long-baseline neutrino experiment,
LBNE. Because of the complementary designs, when DAEdALUS antineutrino data are
combined with LBNE neutrino data, the sensitivity of the CP-violation search
improves beyond any present proposals, including the proposal for Project X.

should primarily heat the ions instead of electrons since they carry most of
the kinetic energy of the infalling gas. Near the accretion shock, the density
of the intracluster medium is very low and the Coulomb collisional timescale is
longer than the accretion timescale. Electrons and ions may not achieve
equipartition in these regions. Numerical simulations have shown that the
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich observables (e.g., the integrated Comptonization parameter
Y) for relaxed clusters can be biased by a few percent. The Y-mass relation can
be biased if non-equipartition effects are not properly taken into account.
Using a set of hydrodynamical simulations, we have calculated three potential
systematic biases in the Y-mass relations introduced by non-equipartition
effects during the cross-calibration or self-calibration when using the galaxy
cluster abundance technique to constraint cosmological parameters. We then use
a semi-analytic technique to estimate the non-equipartition effects on the
distribution functions of Y (Y functions) determined from the extended
Press-Schechter theory. Depending on the calibration method, we find that
non-equipartition effects can induce systematic biases on the Y functions, and
the values of the cosmological parameters Omega_8, sigma_8, and the dark energy
equation of state parameter w can be biased by a few percent. In particular,
non-equipartition effects can introduce an apparent evolution in w of a few
percent in all of the systematic cases we considered. Techniques are suggested
to take into account the non-equipartition effect empirically when using the
cluster abundance technique to study precision cosmology. We conclude that
systematic uncertainties in the Y-mass relation of even a few percent can
introduce a comparable level of biases in cosmological parameter measurements.

confronted with several observational data sets, cosmological tests are indeed
inconclusive about the true signal of $n$ in this class of theories. This is
particularly important to define which kind of corrections (infra-red or
high-energy) to general relativity this class of theory indeed represent. We
shed some light on this question by examining the evolution of the deceleration
parameter $q(z)$ for these theories. We find that for a large range of
$\alpha$, models based on $f(R) = R - \alpha/R^{n}$ gravity in the Palatini

we show that the isotypic part of this space of <= 2d+1-th tensor powers of the

gravity with a topological mass term was investigated. Boundary conditions were
given that were asymptotically invariant under the two-dimensional conformal
group and that included a fall-off of the metric sufficiently slow to
consistently allow pp-wave type of solutions. Now, pp-waves can have two
different chiralities. Above the chiral point and at the chiral point, however,
only one chirality can be considered, namely the chirality that has the milder
behaviour at infinity. The other chirality blows up faster than AdS and does
not define an asymptotically AdS spacetime. By contrast, both chiralities are
subdominant with respect to the asymptotic behaviour of AdS spacetime below the
chiral point. Nevertheless, the boundary conditions given in the earlier
treatment only included one of the two chiralities (which could be either one)
at a time. We investigate in this paper whether one can generalize these
boundary conditions in order to consider simultaneously both chiralities below
the chiral point. We show that this is not possible if one wants to keep the
two-dimensional conformal group as asymptotic symmetry group. Hence, the
boundary conditions given in the earlier treatment appear to be the best
possible ones compatible with conformal symmetry. In the course of our
investigations, we provide general formulas controlling the asymptotic charges
for all values of the topological mass (not just below the chiral point).

(pHTNs) in order to capture a user's preferences on plans, by observing only
the user's behavior. HTNs are a common choice of representation for a variety
of purposes in planning, including work on learning in planning. Our
contributions are (a) learning structure and (b) representing preferences. In
contrast, prior work employing HTNs considers learning method preconditions
(instead of structure) and representing domain physics or search control
knowledge (rather than preferences). Initially we will assume that the observed
distribution of plans is an accurate representation of user preference, and
then generalize to the situation where feasibility constraints frequently
prevent the execution of preferred plans. In order to learn a distribution on
plans we adapt an Expectation-Maximization (EM) technique from the discipline
of (probabilistic) grammar induction, taking the perspective of task reductions
as productions in a context-free grammar over primitive actions. To account for
the difference between the distributions of possible and preferred plans we
subsequently modify this core EM technique, in short, by rescaling its input.

Our results show that by applying the inclusive scheme with $p_{T,j}^{cut}=20

K-factor is 1.15 for the process $p\bar p \to W^{\pm}H^0j+X$ at the Tevatron,

(MCs) cover a number of new and known SNRs which are poorly studied, such as
SNR J0528-6714 . This particular SNR exhibits luminous radio-continuum
emission, but is one of the unusual and rare cases without detectable optical
and very faint X-ray emission (initially detected by ROSAT and listed as object
[HP99] 498). We used new multi-frequency radio-continuum surveys and new
optical observations at H{\alpha}, [S ii] and [O iii] wavelengths, in
combination with XMM-Newton X-ray data, to investigate the SNR properties and
to search for a physical explanation for the unusual appearance of this SNR.
  Methods. We analysed the X-ray and Radio-Continuum spectra and present
multi-wavelength morphological studies of this SNR.
  Results. We present the results of new moderate resolution ATCA observations
of SNR J0528-6714. We found that this object is a typical older SNR with a
radio spectral index of {\alpha}=-0.36 \pm 0.09 and a diameter of D=52.4 \pm
1.0 pc. Regions of moderate and somewhat irregular polarisation were detected
which are also indicative of an older SNR. Using a non-equilibrium ionisation
collisional plasma model to describe the X-ray spectrum, we find temperatures
kT of 0.26 keV for the remnant. The low temperature, low surface brightness,
and large extent of the remnant all indicate a relatively advanced age. The
near circular morphology indicates a Type Ia event.
  Conclusions. Our study revealed one of the most unusual cases of SNRs in the
Local Group of galaxies - a luminous radio SNR without optical counterpart and,
at the same time, very faint X-ray emission. While it is not unusual to not
detect an SNR in the optical, the combination of faint X-ray and no optical
detection makes this SNR very unique.

Hubbard model solved by dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT)) with Debye and
Einstein phonons using recently developed DMFT+Sigma computational scheme.
Electron-phonon interaction (EPI) is analyzed in adiabatic approximation
(assuming the validity of Migdal theorem), allowing the neglect of EPI vertex
corrections. This approach is valid for EPI coupling constant L < e_F/w_ph~10,
where e_F is Fermi energy and w_ph is Debye or Einstein frequency. For moderate
values of L only small changes in the electronic density of states are observed
in DMFT+Sigma approximation for both weakly and strongly correlated metallic
regimes. Metal-insulator (Mott) transition due to the increase of Hubbard
interaction U is slightly inhibited by EPI. Our main aim is to discuss the
interplay of ""kinks"" in electronic dispersion due to EPI and recently
discovered kinks of electronic origin. For the certain region of model
parameters coexistence of phonon ""kinks"" in electronic dispersion with purely
electronic ""kinks"" is readily observed and we formulate some simple criteria of
such coexistence. However, for most general combinations of model parameters
phonon ""kinks"" make electronic ""kinks"" hardly observable. In the general case
an increase of Hubbard interaction U rapidly suppresses the slope of electronic
dispersion within the phonon ""kink"". These results are important for deeper
understanding of the shape and evolution of electronic dispersions in strongly
correlated systems such as copper oxides, where different kinds of ""kinks"" were
recently observed in ARPES experiments.

the laser ring cavity, a series of stable modulation sidebands appears in the
picosecond pulse spectrum at longer wavelength with lower peak power due to
modulation instability induced by cross-phase modulation between the two lasing
wavelengths. Moreover, the intensities and wavelength shifts of the modulation
sidebands can be tuned by varying the power of the femtosecond pulse or the

absorbers in quasar spectra differ intrinsically in metallicity, and whether
they could arise in galaxies of different masses. Using the recent measurements
of the robust metallicity indicators Zn and S in DLAs and sub-DLAs, we confirm
that sub-DLAs have higher mean metallicities than DLAs, especially at $z
\lesssim 2$. We find that the intercept of the metallicity-redshift relation
derived from Zn and S is higher than that derived from Fe by 0.5-0.6 dex. We
also show that, while there is a correlation between the metallicity and the
rest equivalent width of Mg II $\lambda 2796$ or Fe II $\lambda 2599$ for DLAs,
no correlation is seen for sub-DLAs. Given this, and the similar Mg II or Fe II
selection criteria employed in the discovery of both types of systems at lower
redshifts, the difference between metallicities of DLAs and sub-DLAs appears to
be real and not an artefact of selection. This conclusion is supported by our
simulations of Mg II $\lambda 2796$ and Fe II $\lambda 2599$ lines for a wide
range of physical conditions. On examining the velocity spreads of the
absorbers, we find that sub-DLAs show somewhat higher mean and median velocity
spreads ($\Delta v$), and an excess of systems with $\Delta v > 150$ km
s$^{-1}$, than DLAs. Compared to DLAs, the [Mn/Fe] vs. [Zn/H] trend for
sub-DLAs appears to be steeper and closer to the trend for Galactic bulge and
thick disk stars, possibly suggesting different stellar populations. The
absorber data appear to be consistent with galaxy down-sizing. The data are
also consistent with the relative number densities of low-mass and high-mass
galaxies. It is thus plausible that sub-DLAs arise in more massive galaxies on
average than DLAs.

are threaded by a large-scale magnetic field and power a centrifugally driven
wind. It has been argued that in several protostellar systems such a wind
transports a significant fraction of the angular momentum from at least some
part of the disc. We model this case by considering a radially localized disc
model in which the matter is well coupled to the field and the wind is the main
repository of excess angular momentum. We consider stationary solutions in
which magnetic diffusion counters the shearing and advection of the field
lines. In Wardle & K\""onigl we analysed the disc structure in the hydrostatic
approximation and presented disc/wind solutions for the ambipolar diffusivity
regime. In K\""onigl, Salmeron & Wardle (Paper I) we generalized the hydrostatic
analysis to the Hall and Ohm diffusivity domains and identified the parameter
sub-regimes in which viable solutions occur. In this paper we test these
results by deriving numerical solutions (integrated through the sonic critical
surface) of the disc equations in the Hall domain. We confirm the predictions
of the hydrostatic analysis and demonstrate its usefulness for clarifying the
behaviour of the derived solutions. We show that the solutions can be extended
to larger scales (so that they also cross the Alfv\'en critical surface) by
matching the localized disc solutions to global wind solutions of the type
introduced by Blandford & Payne. To facilitate this matching, we construct a
library of wind solutions, which is made available to the community. The
results presented in Wardle & K\""onigl, Paper I and this work form a
comprehensive framework for the study of wind-driving accretion discs in
protostellar and other astrophysical environments. This tool could be useful
for interpreting observations and for guiding numerical simulations of such
systems.

i.e., a sparse coefficient vector s has to be found such that x=As. It is known
that this problem is inherently unstable against noise, and to overcome this
instability, the authors of [Stable Recovery; Donoho et.al., 2006] have
proposed to use an ""approximate"" decomposition, that is, a decomposition
satisfying ||x - A s|| < \delta, rather than satisfying the exact equality x =
As. Then, they have shown that if there is a decomposition with ||s||_0 <
(1+M^{-1})/2, where M denotes the coherence of the dictionary, this
decomposition would be stable against noise. On the other hand, it is known
that a sparse decomposition with ||s||_0 < spark(A)/2 is unique. In other
words, although a decomposition with ||s||_0 < spark(A)/2 is unique, its
stability against noise has been proved only for highly more restrictive
decompositions satisfying ||s||_0 < (1+M^{-1})/2, because usually (1+M^{-1})/2
<< spark(A)/2.
  This limitation maybe had not been very important before, because ||s||_0 <
(1+M^{-1})/2 is also the bound which guaranties that the sparse decomposition
can be found via minimizing the L1 norm, a classic approach for sparse
decomposition. However, with the availability of new algorithms for sparse
decomposition, namely SL0 and Robust-SL0, it would be important to know whether
or not unique sparse decompositions with (1+M^{-1})/2 < ||s||_0 < spark(A)/2
are stable. In this paper, we show that such decompositions are indeed stable.
In other words, we extend the stability bound from ||s||_0 < (1+M^{-1})/2 to
the whole uniqueness range ||s||_0 < spark(A)/2. In summary, we show that ""all
unique sparse decompositions are stably recoverable"". Moreover, we see that
sparser decompositions are ""more stable"".

different ambient fields: no ambient field, and cases with dipole field of two
opposite directions which are parallel and anti-parallel to that of the flux
rope surface. As a result, while the flux rope disappears in the anti-parallel
case, in other cases the flux ropes can evolve to CMEs and show different
amounts of rotation of the flux rope. The results imply that the interaction
between an ejecting flux rope and its ambient field is an important process for
determining CME formation and CME orientation, and also show that the amount

plays a significant role to the rotation of the flux rope, with a process

undesirable goods is profitable to the seller. We prove that in general this
may be the case, depending on the correlation between agents types and
aversion. This is due to screening effects that outperform this aversion. We
analyze, in a continuous framework, both 1D and multidimensional cases.

the largest entry. This construction is of course extremely simple. The cost of
this simplicity is that we need to take into account in the enumeration m-1
additional parameters --- namely, the positions of the leftmost increasing
subsequences of length i, for i=2,...,m. This yields for the generating

the paper is the solution of this equation. We perform a similar task for
involutions with no descending subsequence of length m+1, constructed

typicality, has been defined. It can be applied to both finite or countably

the structural properties of strong typicality. In this paper, unified

fields have been spatially smoothed and temporally averaged in order to reveal
horizontal supergranule-scale motions that may exist at the emission heights of
these passbands. We find indeed a high correlation between the horizontal
velocities derived in the white-light and ultraviolet passbands. The horizontal
velocities derived from the chromospheric and photospheric emission are
comparable in magnitude. The horizontal motions derived in the UV passbands
might indicate the existence of a supergranule-scale magnetoconvection in the
chromosphere, which may shed new light on the study of mass and energy supply
to the corona and solar wind at the height of the chromosphere. However, it is
also possible that the apparent motions reflect the chromospheric brightness
evolution as produced by acoustic shocks which might be modulated by the
photospheric granular motions in their excitation process, or advected partly
by the supergranule-scale flow towards the network while propagating upward
from the photosphere. To reach a firm conclusion, it is necessary to
investigate the role of granular motions in the excitation of shocks through

studied for a range of structures and magnetization of the unshocked ejecta. We
particularly focus on the effect of the ambient medium on the dynamics of an
impulsive, high-sigma shell. It is found that for sufficiently high values of
the initial magnetization $\sigma_0$ the evolution of the system is
significantly altered by the ambient medium well before the shell reaches its
coasting phase. The maximum Lorentz factor of the shell is limited to values
well below $\sigma_0$; for a shell of initial energy $E=10^{52}E_{52}$ ergs and
size $r_0=10^{12}T_{30}$ cm expelled into a medium having a uniform density
$n_i$ we obtain $\Gamma_{\rm max}\simeq180(E_{52}/T_{30}^3 n_i)^{1/8}$ in the
high sigma limit. The reverse shock and any internal shocks that might form if
the source is fluctuating are shown to be very weak. The restriction on the
Lorentz factor is more severe for shells propagating in a stellar wind.
Intermittent ejection of small sub-shells doesn't seem to help, as the shells
merge while still highly magnetized. Lower sigma shells start decelerating
after reaching the coasting phase and spreading away. The properties of the
reverse shock then depend on the density profiles of the coasting shell and the
ambient medium. For a self-similar cold shell the reverse shock becomes strong
as it propagates inwards, and the system eventually approaches the self-similar
solution derived recently by Nakamura \& Shigeyama.

rotation angle per unit length of transverse acoustic modes was found to depend
linearly on sound frequency. Existing theories for this effect consistently
require that it should vary with the square of the frequency. In the present
work a solution for this long-standing problem is provided. We propose a model
based on magnetoelastic interactions with 4f quadrupole moments that includes
both acoustic and optical phonons. The symmetry allows a direct and induced
coupling between the latter. This leads to an indirect acoustic Faraday
rotation via the field induced splitting of doubly degenerate optical phonon
modes. It varies linearly with frequency in accordance with experiment and
dominates the rotation angle. It also explains the observed resonance of the
rotation angle in the field range between 17-20 T. The mechanism is of general
validity for non-Bravais lattices and applies to previous examples of the
acoustic Faraday effect.

oscillatory motion is influenced by the strong interaction between the shear

which arises through this interaction, and present several new results: (1) We
show that global {\it edge modes} frequently reside near the edges of the core
Alfven continuum. (2) We compute the magnetar's oscillatory motion for
realistic axisymmetric magnetic field configurations and core density profiles,
but with a simplified model of the elastic crust. We show that one may
generically get multiple gaps in the Alfven continuum. One obtains discrete
global {\it gap modes} if the crustal frequencies belong to the gaps. (3) We
show that field tangling in the core enhances the role of the core discrete
Alfven modes and reduces the role of the core Alfven continuum in the overall
oscillatory dynamics of the magnetar. (4) We demonstrate that the system
displays transient and/or drifting QPOs when parts of the spectrum of the core
Alfven modes contain discrete modes which are densely and regularly spaced in
frequency. (5) We show that if the neutrons are coupled into the core Alfven
motion, then the post-flare crustal motion is strongly damped and has a very
weak amplitude. Thus magnetar QPOs give evidence that the proton and neutron
components in the core are dynamically decoupled and that at least one of them
is a quantum fluid. (6) We show that it is difficult to identify the
high-frequency 625 Hz QPO as being due to the physical oscillatory mode of the
magnetar, if the latter's fluid core consists of the standard
proton-neutron-electron mixture and is magnetised to the same extent as the

radio survey of an ~ 1.7 sq degree field coinciding with the AKARI North
Ecliptic Pole Deep Field. The observations, data reduction and source count
analysis are presented, along with a description of the overall scientific
objectives. The survey consisted of 10 pointings, mosaiced with enough overlap
to maintain a similar sensitivity across the central region that reached as low
as 21 microJy per beam at 1.4 GHz. A catalogue containing 462 sources detected
with a resolution of 17""x15"" is presented. The differential source counts
calculated from the WSRT data have been compared with those from the shallow
VLA-NEP survey of Kollgaard et al 1994, and show a pronounced excess for
sources fainter than ~ 1 mJy, consistent with the presence of a population of
star forming galaxies at sub-mJy flux levels. The AKARI North Ecliptic Pole
Deep field is the focus of a major observing campaign conducted across the
entire spectral region. The combination of these data sets, along with the deep
nature of the radio observations will allow unique studies of a large range of
topics including the redshift evolution of the luminosity function of radio
sources, the clustering environment of radio galaxies, the nature of obscured
radio-loud active galactic nuclei, and the radio/far-infrared correlation for
distant galaxies. This catalogue provides the basic data set for a future
series of paper dealing with source identifications, morphologies, and the
associated properties of the identified radio sources.

expected, conditional growth for the LambdaCDM power spectrum and cosmological
parameters constrained by WMAP. The observed growth turns out to be within
1-sigma confidence level of the theoretical one, once the proper observational
window of the 2MASS flux dipole is included. For a contrast, if the adopted
window is a top hat, then the predicted dipole grows significantly faster and
converges to its final value at a distance of about 200 Mpc/h. We study the
difference between the top-hat window and the window for the flux-limited 2MASS

distances greater than 200 Mpc/h is only apparent. Eventually, since for the
window function of 2MASS the predicted growth is consistent with the observed

325 and 610 MHz. We find following interesting behaviour just before and after
the nulls: (i) The pulsar's intensity does not switch off abruptly at the null,
but fades gradually, taking ~ 10 P1. Just after nulls intensity rises to a
maximum over a short (less than one period) time scale. (ii) While the last
active pulses before nulls are dimmer, the first few active pulses just after
nulls outshine normal ones. This effect is very clear for inner region of
pulsar profile, where mean intensity of last few active pulses just after nulls
is ~ 2.8 times more than that for last active pulses just before nulls. (iii)
There is a significant evolution of shape of the pulsar's profile, around
nulls, especially at beginning of bursts: an enhanced bump of intensity in
inner region, a change in ratio of strengths of the leading and trailing peaks
towards a more symmetric profile, an increase in profile width of about 10%,
and a shift of profile centre towards later longitudes. (iv) Just before nulls,
the apparent drift rate becomes slower, transitioning to an almost phase
stationary drift pattern. Further, when the pulsar comes out of null, the
increased intensity is very often accompanied by what looks like a disturbed
drift rate behaviour, which settles down to the regular drift pattern as the
pulsar intensity returns to normal. Thus, we find some very specific and well
correlated changes in the radio emission properties of PSR B0818-41 when the
emission restarts after a null. These could imply that the phenomenon of
nulling is associated with some kind of a ""reset"" of the pulsar radio emission
engine. We also present plausible explanations for some of the observed
behaviour, using the Partially Screened Gap model of the inner pulsar
accelerator.

the design and performance of an ADM scheme for two common differentially

than the finite-element (FEM) continuum elasticity model. The generic
properties of the strain distributions in core-shell nanowires obtained based
on the two models agree well. This agreement indicates that although the
calculations based on the VFF model are computationally feasible in many cases,
the continuum elasticity theory suffices to describe the strain distributions
in large core-shell nanowire structures. We find that the obtained strain
distributions for infinite wires are excellent approximations to the strain
distributions in finite wires, except in the regions close to the ends. Thus,
our most computationally efficient model, the finite-element continuum
elasticity model developed for infinite wires, is sufficient, unless edge
effects are important. We give a comprehensive discussion of strain profiles.
We find that the hydrostatic strain in the core is dominated by the axial

individual strain components have a complex structure, the hydrostatic strain
shows a much simpler structure. All in-plane strain components are of similar
magnitude. The non-planar off-diagonal strain-components ($\varepsilon_{\x \z}$

phenomena in a wide range of fields, from molecular biology to ecology. Since
there is currently no agreed-upon standard way to specify such models it is not
always easy to use published models. Also, since model descriptions are not
usually given in mathematical terms, it is difficult to bring mathematical
analysis tools to bear, so that models are typically studied through
simulation. In order to address this issue, Grimm et al. proposed a protocol
for model specification, the so-called ODD protocol, which provides a standard
way to describe models. This paper proposes an addition to the ODD protocol
which allows the description of an agent-based model as a dynamical system,
which provides access to computational and theoretical tools for its analysis.
The mathematical framework is that of algebraic models, that is, time-discrete
dynamical systems with algebraic structure. It is shown by way of several
examples how this mathematical specification can help with model analysis.

  problem","19 pages,1 figure",,,,"math.CA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Hardy-Littlewood majorant problem was raised in the 30's and it can be
formulated as the question whether $\int |f|^p\ge \int|g|^p$ whenever
$\hat{f}\ge|\hat g|$. It has a positive answer only for exponents $p$ which are
even integers. Montgomery conjectured that even among the idempotent
polynomials there must exist some counterexamples, i.e. there exists some
finite set of exponentials and some $\pm$ signs with which the signed
exponential sum has larger $p^{\rm th}$ norm than the idempotent obtained with
all the signs chosen + in the exponential sum. That conjecture was proved
recently by Mockenhaupt and Schlag. \comment{Their construction was used by
Bonami and R\'ev\'esz to find analogous examples among bivariate idempotents,
which were in turn used to show integral concentration properties of univariate
idempotents.}However, a natural question is if even the classical $1+e^{2\pi i
x} \pm e^{2\pi i (k+2)x}$ three-term exponential sums, used for $p=3$ and $k=1$
already by Hardy and Littlewood, should work in this respect. That remained
unproved, as the construction of Mockenhaupt and Schlag works with four-term
idempotents. We investigate the sharpened question and show that at least in
certain cases there indeed exist three-term idempotent counterexamples in the
Hardy-Littlewood majorant problem; that is we have for $0<p<6, p \notin 2\NN$
$\int_0^{\frac12}|1+e^{2\pi ix}-e^{2\pi i([\frac p2]+2)x}|^p >
\int_0^{\frac12}|1+e^{2\pi ix}+e^{2\pi i([\frac p2]+2)x}|^p$. The proof
combines delicate calculus with numerical integration and precise error
estimates.

the eigenstate is an analytic vector with respect to $A$. Natural applications

model reduce to a mixed Chern-Simons term and we show that the superconducting
phase has a ground state degeneracy $k$ and not $k^2$. When the symmetry is
$U(1) \times U(1)$, namely when both gauge fields are compact, this model is
not equivalent to the sum of two Chern-Simons term with opposite chirality,
even if naively diagonalizable. This is due to the fact that U(1) symmetry
requires an ultraviolet regularization that make the diagonalization
impossible. This can be clearly seen using a lattice regularization, where the
gauge fields become angular variables. Moreover we will show that the phase in

low temperature antiferromagnetic transition due to the ordering of the
rare-earth moments, the expected ferroelectric transition is frustrated by the
large size difference between Cu and Ti at the B-site. Interestingly, this
leads these compounds to attain a rare and unique combination of desirable
paraelectric properties with high dielectric constants, low losses and weak
temperature and frequency dependencies. First-principles calculations establish
these exceptional properties result from a combination of two effects. A
significant difference in the MO5 polyhedral sizes for M = Cu and M = Ti
suppress the expected co-operative tilt pattern of these polyhedra, required
for the ferroelectric transition, leading to relatively large values of the
dielectric constant for every compound investigated in this series.
Additionally, it is shown that the majority contribution to the dielectric
constant arises from intermediate-frequency polar vibrational modes, making it
relatively stable against any temperature variation. Changes in the temperature
stability of the dielectric constant amongst different members of this series
are shown to arise from changes in relative contributions from soft polar

networks and on synthetic benchmarks. Much less is known about their
performance on large real-world networks, which nonetheless are a significant
target for application. We analyze the performance of three state-of-the-art
community detection methods by using them to identify communities in a large
social network constructed from mobile phone call records. We find that all
methods detect communities that are meaningful in some respects but fall short
in others, and that there often is a hierarchical relationship between
communities detected by different methods. Our results suggest that community
detection methods could be useful in studying the general mesoscale structure
of networks, as opposed to only trying to identify dense structures.

approximately follows the depairing critical current (I_c) but falls below it.
Fluctuations in I_s exhibit three distinct regions of behaviors and are
non-monotonic in temperature: saturation well below the critical temperature
T_c, an increase as T^{2/3} at intermediate temperatures, and a rapid decrease
close to T_c. Heat dissipation analysis indicates that a single phase slip is
able to trigger switching at low and intermediate temperatures, whereby the
T^{2/3} dependence arises from the thermal activation of a phase slip, while
saturation at low temperatures provides striking evidence that the phase slips
by macroscopic quantum tunneling.

renormalisation. This allows to define the vertex function precisely, at a
fixed physical momentum that need not be one of the Fourier modes of a
simulation. This definition includes choosing the orientation with respect to
lattice axes, and so lattice artefacts including ${\cal O}(4)$ breaking then
have a valid Symanzik expansion. Excellent statistical precision is afforded by
volume plane-wave sources, enabling both a theoretically and statistically
clean continuum limit to be taken. Thereafter all $p^2$ dependence can be
unambiguously identified as continuum anomolous running.
  The use of non-exceptional momenta has been found to greatly reduce the
dependence of non-perturbative vertex functions on both mass and $p^2$. We
illustrate how this can be developed into a practical scheme for step-scaling
the RI/SMOM approach with initial results. The size of the possible steps is
continuous, rather than discrete allowing one to take arbitrarily small steps,
and the scheme inherits from RI/MOM the property that it is easy to implement
for general operators.

The saturation scale is nearly uniform in a wide domain around each point in

calculations are done for specific saturation models which are obtained from

differential equations and corresponding wave speed. As a particular example we
consider the Nagumo equation with multiplicative noise which we mainly consider
in the Stratonovich sense. A standard approach to determine the position and
hence speed of a wave is to compute the evolution of a level set. We compare
this approach against an alternative where the wave position is found by
minimizing the $L^2$ norm against a fixed profile. This approach can also be
used to stop (or freeze) the wave and obtain a stochastic partial differential
algebraic equation that we then discretize and solve. Although attractive as it
leads to a smaller domain size it can be numerically unstable due to large
convection terms. We compare numerically the different approaches for
estimating the wave speed. Minimization against a fixed profile works well
provided the support of the reference function is not too narrow. We then use
these techniques to investigate the effect of both \Ito and Stratonovich noise
on the Nagumo equation as correlation length and noise intensity increases.

if the model parameter $\alpha$ (of order unity) is tuned accordingly.
Moreover, this behavior is achieved by treating the Brans-Dicke scalar field as
a Chameleon scalar field and taking a non-minimal coupling of the scalar field
with matter. Hence one can generate phantom-like equation of state from a
holographic dark energy model in non-flat universe in the Brans-Dicke cosmology
