cosmic string loops at any redshift soon after the time of string formation to
today. Our approach is based on the Polchinski-Rocha model of loop formation
from long strings which we adjust to fit numerical simulations and complement
by a phenomenological modelling of gravitational backreaction. Cosmological
evolution drives the loop distribution towards scaling on all length scales in
both the radiation and matter era. Memory of any reasonable initial loop
distribution in the radiation era is shown to be erased well before Big Bang
Nucleosynthesis. In the matter era, the loop distribution reaches full scaling,
up to some residual loops from the radiation era which may be present for
extremely low string tension. Finally, the number density of loops below the
gravitational cutoff is shown to be scale independent, proportional to a
negative power of the string tension and insensitive to the details of the
backreaction modelling. As an application, we show that the energy density
parameter of loops today cannot exceed 10^(-5) for currently allowed string
tension values, while the loop number density cannot be less than 10^(-6) per
Mpc^3. Our result should provide a more robust basis for studying the
cosmological consequences of cosmic string loops.

  Aims. We aim to constrain physical models of grain growth and fragmentation
by a large sample of (sub-)mm observations of disks around pre-main sequence
stars in the Taurus-Auriga and Ophiuchus star-forming regions.
  Methods. State-of-the-art coagulation/fragmentation and disk-structure codes
are coupled to produce steady-state grain size distributions and to predict the
spectral slopes at (sub-)mm wavelengths.
  Results. This work presents the first calculations predicting the mm spectral
slope based on a physical model of grain growth. Our models can quite naturally
reproduce the observed mm-slopes, but a simultaneous match to the observed
range of flux levels can only be reached by a reduction of the dust mass by a
factor of a few up to about 30 while keeping the gas mass of the disk the same.
This dust reduction can either be due to radial drift at a reduced rate or
during an earlier evolutionary time (otherwise the predicted fluxes would
become too low) or due to efficient conversion of dust into larger, unseen
bodies.

self-assembling ordered mesoporous materials formed by an organic template with
amphiphilic properties and an inorganic precursor in a model solvent. Three
classes of inorganic precursors have been modeled: terminal (R-Si-(OEt)3) and
bridging ((EtO)3-Si-R-Si-(OEt)3)) organosilica precursors (OSPs), along with
pure silica precursors (Si-(OEt)4). Each class has been studied by analyzing
its solubility in the solvent and the solvophobicity of the inorganic group. At
high surfactant concentrations, periodic ordered structures, such as
hexagonally-ordered cylinders or lamellas, can be obtained depending on the
OSPs used. Ordered structures were obtained in a wider range of conditions when
bridging hydrophilic OSPs have been used, because a higher surfactant
concentration was reached in the phase where the material was formed. Terminal
and bridging OSPs produced ordered structures only when the organic group is
solvophilic. In this case, a partial solubility between the precursor and the
solvent or a lower temperature favored the formation of ordered phases. With
particular interest, we have analyzed the range of conditions leaving to the
formation of cylindrical structures, which have been evaluated according to the
pore size distribution, the pore wall thickness, the distribution and the
accessibility of the functional organic groups around the pores. The phase
behavior has been also evaluated by applying the quasi-chemical theory, which
cannot predict the formation of ordered structures, but confirmed the results
of simulations when no ordered structures were observed. The study of the phase
and aggregation behavior of two different surfactants, one modeled by a linear
chain of head segments and the other modeled by a branched-head, permitted us
to evaluate some structural differences of the materials obtained.

Msun the rotation periods, vsini and radius estimates are consistent with the
stars having an isotropic distribution of rotation axes, if a moderate

very important factors come into play side by side: the lack of the NS
gravitational self-stabilization against shutting to black hole (BH) and the
phase transition - color deconfinement and QCD-vacuum reconstruction - within
the nuclear matter the NS is composed of. That is why both phenomena should be
taken into account at once, as the gravitational collapse is considered. Since,
under the above transition, the hadronic-phase (HPh) vacuum (filled up with
gluon- and chiral $q\bar q$-condensates) turns into the ""empty"" (perturbation)
subhadronic-phase (SHPh) one and, thus, the formerly (very high) pressure falls
down rather abruptly, the formerly cold nuclear medium starts imploding almost
freely into the new vacuum. If the star mass is sufficiently large, then this
implosion is shown to result in an enormous heating - up to the temperature
about 100 MeV or, may be, even higher - and growth of the inner pressure due to
degeneracy breaking and multiple $q\bar q$-pair production which withstands the
gravitational compression (remind that the highest temperatures of supernovae
bursts, as well as of the ""normal"" NS, are, at least, of one order lower). As a
consequence, a ""flaming wall"" is, most probably, emerged on the way of further
collapsing which prevents the NS to evolve towards the BH horizon appearance.
At the same time, it could give rise to the most powerful GRBs produced by some

changes upon tuning the interaction strength. The results we obtain for

this approximation the hydrodynamic equations of motion can be written as a set
of decoupled forced Riemann-Hopf equations for the dressed Fermi momenta of the

and charge. We describe the time evolution of the charge density when an

additional potential in place and then suddenly removing the potential. We

indirect methods such as metallicity gradients in host galaxies, luminosities
of host galaxies, or derived global galaxy metallicities. Here, progenitor
metallicities are derived from optical spectra taken at the sites of nearby
supernovae, from the ratio of strong emission lines found in their host HII
regions.We present results from the spectra of 74 host HII regions and discuss
the implications that these have on the nature of core-collapse supernova
progenitors. Overall, while we find that the mean metallicity of type Ibc
environments is higher than that of type II events, this difference is smaller
than observed in previous studies. There is only a 0.06 dex difference in the
mean metallicity values, at a statistical significance of ~1.5 sigma, while
using a KS-test we find that the two metallicity distributions are marginally
consistent with being drawn from the same parent population (probability >10%).
This argues that progenitor metallicity is not a dominant parameter in deciding
supernovae type, with progenitor mass and/or binarity playing a much more
significant role.

there are no reliable general techniques [4,5] to calculate the scaling
functions for dynamics. Viewing a cold atom experiment as a quantum simulator

model is based on a simple generalization of the configuration model, and
epidemic dynamics are modeled with a low dimensional system of ordinary
differential equations. Because of the simplicity of this model, we are able to
explore a large parameter space and characterize dynamics over a wide range of
network topologies. We find that the interaction between clustering and the
degree distribution is complex, and that clustering always slows down an
epidemic, but that simultaneously increasing clustering and variance of the
degree distribution can potentially increase final epidemic size. In contrast
to solutions for unclustered configuration model networks, we find that bond

NGC 7469, we include optical spectroscopy from VLT/UVES. In both sightlines the
MS is detected in low-ion and high-ion absorption. Toward NGC 7469, we measure
a MS oxygen abundance [O/H]_MS=[OI/HI]=-1.00+/-0.05(stat)+/-0.08(syst),
supporting the view that the Stream originates in the SMC rather than the LMC.
We use CLOUDY to model the low-ion phase of the Stream as a photoionized plasma
using the observed Si III/Si II and C III/C II ratios. Toward Mrk 335 this
yields an ionization parameter log U between -3.45 and -3.15 and a gas density
log (n_H/cm^-3) between -2.51 and -2.21. Toward NGC 7469 we derive sub-solar
abundance ratios for [Si/O], [Fe/O], and [Al/O], indicating the presence of
dust in the MS. The high-ion column densities are too large to be explained by
photoionization, but also cannot be explained by a single-temperature
collisional-ionization model (equilibrium or non-equilibrium). This suggests
the high-ion plasma is multi-phase. Summing over the low-ion and high-ion
phases, we derive conservative lower limits on the ratio N(total H II)/N(H I)
of >19 toward NGC 7469 and >330 toward Mrk 335, showing that along these two
directions the vast majority of the Stream has been ionized. The presence of
warm-hot plasma together with the small-scale structure observed at 21 cm
provides evidence for an evaporative interaction with the hot Galactic corona.
This scenario, predicted by hydrodynamical simulations, suggests that the fate
of the MS will be to replenish the Galactic corona with new plasma, rather than
to bring neutral fuel to the disk.

Galaxy (ERG) populations, selected in the GOODS-South/Chandra Deep Field South
field. By using all the photometric and spectroscopic information available on
large deep samples of EROs (645 sources), IEROs (294 sources), and DRGs (350
sources), we derive redshift distributions, identify AGN powered and
Star-formation powered galaxies, and, using the radio observations of this
field, estimate robust (AGN- and dust-unbiased) Star Formation Rate Densities
(SFRD) for these populations. We also investigate the properties of ""pure""
(galaxies that conform to only one of the three ERG criteria considered) and
""combined"" (galaxies that verify all three criteria) sub-populations. Overall,
a large number of AGN are identified (up to ~30%, based on X-rays, and
mid-infrared criteria), the majority of which are type-2 (obscured) objects.
Among ERGs with no evidence for AGN activity, we identify sub-populations
covering a wide range of average star-formation rates, from below 10 Mo/yr to
as high as 200 Mo/yr. Applying a redshift separation (1<z<2 and 2<z<3) we find
significant evolution (an increase of a factor of 2 or higher) of SFRD for EROs
and DRGs, while none is observed for IEROs. The former populations can
contribute more than 20\% to the global SFRD at 2<z<3. The emission from AGN
activity is typically not strong in the ERG population, with AGN increasing the
average radio luminosity of ERG sub-populations by, nominally, less than 20%.
AGN are common, however, and, if no discrimination is attempted, this could
significantly increase the SFRD estimate (by over 100% in some cases). Thus,
and while the contribution of star forming processes to the radio luminosity in
galaxies with AGN remains uncertain, a comprehensive identification of AGN in
these populations is necessary to obtain meaningful results.

successive reconnections) of cosmic strings at ultra-high collision speeds, and
the formation of ``kink trains'' with up to four closely spaced left- or
right-moving kinks. We performed a flat space numerical study of abelian Higgs
cosmic string intercommutation in the type-II regime $\beta > 1$ (where $\beta
= m^2_{scalar} / m^2_{gauge}$) up to $\beta = 64$, the highest value
investigated to date. Our results confirm earlier claims that the minimum
critical speed for double reconnection goes down with increasing $\beta$, from
$\sim 0.98 c$ at $\beta = 1$ to $\sim 0.86 c$ for $\beta = 64$. Furthermore, we
observe a qualitative change in the process leading to the second
intercommutation: if $\beta \geq 16$ it is mediated by a loop expanding from
the collision point whereas if $1 < \beta \leq 8 $ the previously reported
``loop'' is just an expanding blob of radiation which has no topological
features and is absorbed by the strings. The multiple reconnections are
observed in the loop-mediated, deep type-II regime $\beta \geq 16$. Triple
reconnections appear to be quite generic for collision parameters on the
boundary between single and double reconnection. For $\beta = 16$ we observe
quadruple events. They result in clustering of small scale structure in the
form of ``kink trains''. Our findings suggest that, due to the core
interactions, the small scale structure and stochastic gravitational wave
background of abelian Higgs strings in the strongly type-II regime may be quite
different from what would be expected from studies of Nambu-Goto strings or of
abelian Higgs strings in the $\beta \approx 1$ regime.

consider specific dark matter candidates and assess their potential for
detection via antideuterons from their hadronic annihilation channels. Since
the dark matter mass reach of the GAPS experiment can be well above 100 GeV, we
find that antideuterons can be a good indirect detection channel for a variety
of thermal relic electroweak scale dark matter candidates, even when the rate

follows the distribution of the dust mass, which is derived from the model. The
PAH-to-dust mass (f_PAH) image of the strip reveals a possible enhancement in
the LMC bar in agreement with previous work. We compare the gas mass
distribution derived from the HI 21 cm and CO J=1-0 line emission maps to the
dust mass map from the models and derive gas-to-dust mass ratios (GDRs). The
dust model, which uses the standard graphite and silicate optical properties

  Journal as a Letter",,"10.1088/2041-8205/717/2/L122",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We report spectropolarimetric observations of the quasar E1821+643 (z=0.297),
which suggest that it may be an example of gravitational recoil due to
anisotropic emission of gravitational waves following the merger of a
supermassive black hole (SMBH) binary. In total flux, the broad Balmer lines
are redshifted by ~1000 km/s relative to the narrow lines and have highly red
asymmetric profiles, whereas in polarized flux the broad H_alpha line exhibits
a blueshift of similar magnitude and a strong blue asymmetry. We show that
these observations are consistent with a scattering model in which the
broad-line region has two components, moving with different bulk velocities
away from the observer and towards a scattering region at rest in the host
galaxy. If the high velocity system is identified as gas bound to the SMBH,
this implies that the SMBH is itself moving with a velocity ~2100 km/s relative
to the host galaxy. We discuss some implications of the recoil hypothesis and
also briefly consider whether our observations can be explained in terms of
scattering of broad-line emission originating from the active component of an
SMBH binary, or from an outflowing wind.

antidot lattices (graphene nanomeshes), i.e., triangular superlattices of

whose magnitude can be controlled via the antidot size and density. The
relevant coupling mechanism in these semiconducting counterparts of graphene is
the modulation of the nearest-neighbor electronic hopping integrals due to
lattice distortions (Peierls-type e-ph coupling). We compute the full momentum
dependence of the e-ph vertex functions for a number of representative antidot
lattices. Based on the latter, we discuss the origins of the previously found
large conduction-band quasiparticle spectral weight due to e-ph coupling. In
addition, we study the nonzero-momentum quasiparticle properties with the aid
of the self-consistent Born approximation, yielding results that can be
compared with future angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements.
Our principal finding is a significant e-ph mass enhancement, an indication of
polaronic behavior. This can be ascribed to the peculiar momentum dependence of
the e-ph interaction in these narrow-band systems, which favors small phonon
momentum scattering. We also discuss implications of our study for recently

The robust removal of field contamination provides a reliable disk fraction
down to our completeness limit of H=19 mag, or about 5 Msun at the distance of
the Arches. Of the 24 identified sources with K'-L' > 2.0 mag, 21 have reliable

reveals strong CO bandhead emission, which we interpret as the signature of
dense circumstellar disks. The detection of strong disk emission from the
Arches stars is surprising in view of the high mass of the B-type main sequence
host stars of the disks and the intense starburst environment. We find a disk
fraction of 6 +/- 2% among B-type stars in the Arches cluster. A radial
increase in the disk fraction from 3 to 10% suggests rapid disk destruction in
the immediate vicinity of numerous O-type stars in the cluster core. A
comparison between the Arches and other high- and low-mass star-forming regions
provides strong indication that disk depletion is significantly more rapid in
compact starburst clusters than in moderate star-forming environments.

computation from the rich background of the standard Hilbert space model.
Category theory, on the other hand, is a general tool to separate components of
mathematical structures, and analyze one layer at a time. It seems natural to
combine the two approaches, and several authors have already pursued this idea.
We explore *categorical comprehension construction* as a tool for adding
features to toy models. We use it to comprehend quantum propositions and
probabilities within the basic model of finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. We
also analyze complementary quantum observables over the category of sets and
relations. This leads into the realm of *test spaces*, a well-studied model. We
present one of many possible extensions of this model, enabled by the
comprehension construction. Conspicuously, all models obtained in this way
carry the same categorical structure, *extending* the familiar dagger compact
framework with the complementation operations. We call the obtained structure
*dagger mix autonomous*, because it extends mix autonomous categories, popular
in computer science, in a similar way like dagger compact structure extends
compact categories. Dagger mix autonomous categories seem to arise quite
naturally in quantum computation, as soon as complementarity is viewed as a
part of the global structure.

  Clustering Trees","25 pages, 14 figures",,,,"stat.AP q-bio.PE stat.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Inferential summaries of tree estimates are useful in the setting of
evolutionary biology, where phylogenetic trees have been built from DNA data
since the 1960's. In bioinformatics, psychometrics and data mining,
hierarchical clustering techniques output the same mathematical objects, and
practitioners have similar questions about the stability and `generalizability'
of these summaries. This paper provides an implementation of the geometric
distance between trees developed by Billera, Holmes and Vogtmann (2001) [BHV]
equally applicable to phylogenetic trees and hieirarchical clustering trees,
and shows some of the applications in statistical inference for which this
distance can be useful. In particular, since BHV have shown that the space of
trees is negatively curved (a CAT(0) space), a natural representation of a
collection of trees is a tree. We compare this representation to the Euclidean
approximations of treespace made available through Multidimensional Scaling of
the matrix of distances between trees. We also provide applications of the
distances between trees to hierarchical clustering trees constructed from
microarrays. Our method gives a new way of evaluating the influence both of
certain columns (positions, variables or genes) and of certain rows (whether
species, observations or arrays).

Camera for Surveys General Catalog (ACS-GC) to identify 372, 1360, and 1238 AGN
host galaxies from the VLA, XMM-Newton and Spitzer Space Telescope observations
of the COSMOS field, respectively. We investigate both quantitative (GALFIT)
and qualitative (visual) morphologies of these AGN host galaxies, split by
brightness in their selection band. We find that the radio-selected AGN are
most distinct, with a very low incidence of having unresolved optical
morphologies and a high incidence of being hosted by early-type galaxies. In
comparison to X-ray selected AGN, mid-IR selected AGN have a slightly higher
incidence of being hosted by disk galaxies. These morphological results conform
with the results of Hickox et al. 2009 who studied the colors and large-scale
clustering of AGN, and found a general association of radio-selected AGN with
``red sequence'' galaxies, mid-IR selected AGN with ``blue cloud'' galaxies,
and X-ray selected AGN straddling these samples in the ``green valley.'' In the
general scenario where AGN activity marks and regulates the transition from
late-type disk galaxies into massive elliptical galaxies, this work suggests
that the earlier stages are most evident as mid-IR selected AGNs. Mid-IR
emission is less susceptible to absorption than the relatively soft X-rays
probed by XMM-Newton, which are seen at later stages in the transition.
Radio-selected AGN are then typically associated with minor bursts of activity
in the most massive galaxies.

Simulation results show that Q-learning based free riding control mechanism
effectively limits the services received by free-riders and also encourages the
low-performing neighbours to improve their position. The popular files are
autonomously replicated to nodes possessing required parameters. Due to this
improvement of quantity of popular files, free riders are given opportunity to

identifying documents containing relevant topics of interest. We developed a
simple method that uses a chi-square-based scoring function to determine the
likelihood of MEDLINE citations containing genetic relevant topic. Methods: Our
procedure requires construction of a genetic and a nongenetic domain document
corpus. We used MeSH descriptors assigned to MEDLINE citations for this
categorization task. We compared frequencies of MeSH descriptors between two
corpora applying chi-square test. A MeSH descriptor was considered to be a
positive indicator if its relative observed frequency in the genetic domain
corpus was greater than its relative observed frequency in the nongenetic
domain corpus. The output of the proposed method is a list of scores for all
the citations, with the highest score given to those citations containing MeSH
descriptors typical for the genetic domain. Results: Validation was done on a
set of 734 manually annotated MEDLINE citations. It achieved predictive
accuracy of 0.87 with 0.69 recall and 0.64 precision. We evaluated the method
by comparing it to three machine learning algorithms (support vector machines,
decision trees, na\""ive Bayes). Although the differences were not statistically
significantly different, results showed that our chi-square scoring performs as
good as compared machine learning algorithms. Conclusions: We suggest that the
chi-square scoring is an effective solution to help categorize MEDLINE
citations. The algorithm is implemented in the BITOLA literature-based
discovery support system as a preprocessor for gene symbol disambiguation

framework for handling high-dimensional microarray data. In this paper, we

strong aperiodic flux variations with low and high states. We have investigated
the eclipse transitions of Cen X-3 in different intensity states with data
obtained from pointed observations with the more sensitive instruments on board
ASCA, BeppoSAX, XMM-Newton, Chandra and RXTE. We found a very clear trend of
sharp eclipse transitions in the high state and longer transitions in the low
state. This is a confirmation of this feature first observed with the RXTE-ASM
but now with much better clarity. From the light curves obtained from several
missions, it is seen that the eclipse egress in the low state starts earlier by
an orbital phase of 0.02 indicating that the observed X-rays originate from a
much larger region. We have also performed spectral analysis of the
post-eclipse part of each observations. From BeppoSAX observations, the
out-of-eclipse X-ray fluxes is found to differ by a factor of ~ 26 during the
high and low intensity states while the eclipse count rates differ by a factor
of only ~ 4.7. This indicates that in the low state, there is an additional
scattering medium which scatters some of the source photons towards the
observer even when the neutron star is completely eclipsed. We could also
resolve the three iron line components using XMM-Newton observation in the low
state. By comparing the iron line equivalent width during the high and low
states, it is seen that the width of iron line is relatively large during the
low state which supports the fact that significant reprocessing and scattering
of X-rays takes place in the low state.

of the object is small and the length along the propagation direction of the

mechanism is explained in details. The incident electromagnetic energy can only
flow almost normally through the outer surface into or out of the
permittivity-near-zero object, which leads to large energy stream density and
then strong electric field inside the object. Meanwhile, the magnetic field
inside the permittivity-near-zero object may be smaller than that of the
incident wave, which is also helpful for enhancing the electric field. Two
permittivity-near-zero objects of simple shapes, namely, a thin cylindrical
shell and a long thin rectangular bar, are chosen for numerical illustration.
The enhancement of the electric field becomes stronger when the

the stacking: for the ABAB and ABCA stacking, the bands, close to the K point,
are characterized by the hyperbolic dispersion relation while the AA stacking
the dispersion in this region is linear, similar to that of a single graphene
layer. It was also shown that the linear dispersion relation is preserved in
the presence of the SiC substrate, and also for different distances between

It is also shown that the controlled teleportation of this n-qubit state can be
achieved by using a GHZ state or a GHZ-like state as quantum channel. The
proposed schemes are economical because for the perfect and controlled
teleportation of n-qubit non-maximally entangled state of generalized Bell-type
we only need a Bell state and a tripartite entangled state respectively. It is

equilibrium and motion of an interphase boundary. This point of view makes
evident the tendency to minimization of the length of the contact line at
equilibrium. The concept of line tension is, however, of limited applicability,
in view of a qualitatively different relaxation response of the contact line,
compared to a two-dimensional curve. Both the analogy and qualitative
distinction extend to a non-equilibrium situation arising due to coupling with
reversible substrate modification. Under these conditions, the contact line may
suffer a variety of chemo-capillary instabilities (fingering, traveling and
oscillatory), similar to those of dissipative structures in nonlinear
non-equilibrium systems. The preference order of the various instabilities
changes, however, significantly due to a different way the interfacial
curvature is relaxed.

wells in the intrinsic region. Previous work has shown that QWSCs have a
greater open circuit voltage (Voc) than would be provided by a cell with the
quantum well effective bandgap. This suggests that the fundamental efficiency
limits of QWSCs are greater than those of single bandgap solar cells. The
following work investigates QWSCs in the GaAs/AlxGa1-xAs materials system. The
design and optimisation of a QWSC in this system requires studies of the
voltage and current dependencies on the aluminium fraction. QWSCs with
different aluminium fractions have been studied and show an increasing Voc with
increasing barrier aluminium composition. The QE however decreases with
increasing aluminium composition. We develop a model of the QE to test novel
QWSC designs with a view to minimising this problem. This work concentrates on
two design changes. The first deals with com- positionally graded structures in
which the bandgap varies with position. This bandgap variation introduces an
quasi electric field which can be used to increase minority carrier collection
in the low efficiency p and n layers. This technique also increases the light
flux reaching the highly efficient depletion regions. The second design change
consists of coating the back of the cell with a mirror to exploit the portion
of light which is not absorbed on the first pass. A model of the QE of
compositionally graded QWSC solar cells with back surface mirrors is developed
in order to analyse the effect of these design changes. These changes are
implemented separately in a number of QWSC designs and the resulting
experimental data compared with the model. An optimised design is then
presented.
