2009 of 14 Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients (SFXTs), implying a net exposure
time of about 30Ms. For each source we obtained lightcurves and spectra
(3-100keV), discovering several new outbursts. We discuss the X-ray behaviour
of SFXTs emerging from our analysis in the framework of the clumpy wind
accretion mechanism we proposed (Ducci et al. 2009). We discuss the effect of
X-ray photoionization on accretion in close binary systems like IGRJ16479-4514
and IGRJ17544-2619. We show that, because of X-ray photoionization, there is a
high probability of formation of an accretion disk from capture of angular
momentum in IGRJ16479-4514, and we suggest that the formation of transient
accretion disks could be responsible of part of the flaring activity in SFXTs
with narrow orbits. We also propose an alternative way to explain the origin of
flares with peculiar shapes observed in our analysis applying the model of Lamb
et al. (1977), which is based on the accretion via Rayleigh-Taylor instability,
and was originally proposed to explain type II bursts.

is a critical pumping amplitude in which the atoms self-organize and the intra

show that the Josephson oscillations depend strongly on the atomic density and

of Bose-Einstein condensates in double-well setups. This pseudo self-trapping
effect is studied within a mean-field treatment valid for large atom numbers.
For small numbers of atoms, we consider the analogous many-body problem and
demonstrate a collapse-revival structure in the Josephson oscillations.

varying within their respective errors astrophysical parameters such as the

Boltzmann system is to use a combination of different approximations and
expansions. Usually a Chapman-Enskog analysis is performed, either on the
continuous Boltzmann system, or its discrete velocity counterpart. Separately a
discrete time approximation is introduced to the discrete velocity Boltzmann
system, to achieve a practically useful approximation to the continuous system,
for use in computation. Thereafter, with some additional arguments, the
dynamics of the Chapman-Enskog expansion are linked to the discrete time system
to produce the dynamics of the completely discrete scheme. In this paper we put
forward a different route to the macroscopic dynamics. We begin with the system
discrete in both velocity space and time. We hypothesize that the alternating
steps of advection and relaxation, common to all lattice Boltzmann schemes,
give rise to a slow invariant manifold. We perform a time step expansion of the
discrete time dynamics using the invariance of the manifold. Finally we
calculate the dynamics arising from this system. By choosing the fully discrete
scheme as a starting point we avoid mixing approximations and arrive at a
general form of the microscopic dynamics up to the second order in the time
step. We calculate the macroscopic dynamics of two commonly used lattice
schemes up to the first order, and hence find the precise form of the deviation
from the Navier-Stokes equations in the dissipative term, arising from the
discretization of velocity space. Finally we perform a short wave perturbation
on the dynamics of these example systems, to find the necessary conditions for
their stability.

cases of the electromagnetic field, linearized gravity and scalar fields with
arbitrary mass and curvature coupling. Given an arbitrary set of such charges,
there is a generic result for sufficiently late times which corresponds to each
charge being surrounded by a field zone with negligible influence from the
other charges. Furthermore, we explicitly find a static solution in the static
patch adapted to a charge (implying no energy loss by the charge) which can be
regularly extended beyond the horizon to the full de Sitter spacetime, and show
that any other solution decays at late times to this one. On the other hand,
for non-conformal scalar fields the inertial observers naturally associated
with spatially flat coordinates will see a non-vanishing flux far from the
horizon, which will fall off more slowly than the inverse square of the
distance for sufficiently light fields (m^2 + \xi R < 5H^2/4) and give rise to
a total integrated flux that grows unboundedly with the radius. This can be
qualitatively interpreted as a consequence of a classical parametric
amplification of the field generated by the charge due to the time-dependent
background spacetime. Most of these results do not hold for massless minimally
coupled scalar fields, whose special behavior is analyzed separately.

Taking full account of the instrumental resolution, we derive analytical model

absolute units. Our models are supported by previous results on similar samples
and are valid at least up to excitation energies of omega = 100 meV. The
detailed knowledge of chi''(Q,omega) permits quantitative comparison to the
results of complementary techniques including angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (ARPES), as demonstrated in Dahm et al., Nature Phys. 5, 217,
(2009). Based on accurate modeling of the effect of the resolution function on
the detected intensity, we determine important intrinsic features of the spin
excitation spectrum, with a focus on the differences above and below Tc. In
particular, at T = 70 K the spectrum exhibits a pronounced twofold in-plane
anisotropy at low energies, which evolves towards fourfold rotational symmetry
at high energies, and the relation dispersion is ""Y""-shaped. At T = 5 K, on the
other hand, the spectrum develops a continuous, downward-dispersing ""resonant""
mode with weaker in-plane anisotropy. We understand this topology change as
arising from the competition between superconductivity and the same electronic
liquid-crystal state as observed in YBa(2)Cu(3)O(6.45). We discuss our data in

of the quark potentials are adjusted in order to sufficiently describe

incorporate the obtained transverse-momentum distribution in a perturbative QCD

pp collisions. A large set of experimental data is fitted using as a single

on the collision characteristics (initial energy and transverse momentum of the
final photon) is much smoother when compared with similar results found in the
literature using a Gaussian distribution for the partonic transverse momenta.
Within the considered class of hyper-central quark potentials the one with the
weaker dependence on the hyper-radius is preferred for the description of the

We have repeated all the calculations using a two-body potential of the same

integrability conditions the Tartar approach based on the oscillations test
functions method applies and leads to a limit equation with an extra zero-order
term. When the drift is only assumed to be equi-integrable in $L^2$, the same
limit behaviour is obtained. However, the lack of integrability makes difficult
the direct use of the Tartar method. A new method in the context of
homogenization theory is proposed. It is based on a parametrix of the Laplace
operator which permits to write the solution of the equation as a solution of a
fixed point problem, and to use truncated functions even in the vector-valued
case. On the other hand, two counter-examples which induce different
homogenized zero-order terms actually show the optimality of the
equi-integrability assumption.

a systematic design of a precoder codebook for SDMA sharing spectrum with

null in the direction angle while satisfying orthogonal beamforming constraint.
We derive not only asymptotic throughput scaling laws, but also an upperbound
on throughput loss to analyze performance loss of the proposed SDMA relative to
the popular SDMA called per-user unitary rate control (PU2RC). Furthermore, we
develop a method of evaluating protection distance in order to analyze the
spectrum sharing performance of the proposed approach. The simulation results
of protection distance confirm that the proposed SDMA efficiently shares
spectrum with FWS systems by reducing protection distance to more than 66%.
Although our proposed SDMA always has lower throughput compared to PU2RC in
non-coexistence scenario, it offers an intriguing opportunity to reuse spectrum
already allocated to FWS.

exemplar-based description for a system of behavior minimizes the overall
uncertainty of the system. The measure used in QAM differs from the traditional
logarithmic measure of uncertainty; instead QAM uses a quadratic measure of
disagreement between pairs of exemplars. (This quadratic measure parallels the
squaring function holding between the amplitude and the probability for a state
function in quantum mechanics.) QAM eliminates all supracontexts (contextual
groupings of exemplars) that fail to minimize the number of disagreements. The
resulting system thus distinguishes between homogeneous and heterogeneous
supracontexts and uses only exemplars in homogeneous supracontexts to predict
behavior. This paper revises earlier work on QAM (in 2005) by showing that
homogeneity for a supracontext can be most simply determined by discovering
whether there are any heterogeneous pointers between any of the supracontext's
exemplars. A pointer for a pair of exemplars is heterogeneous whenever those
two exemplars are found in different subcontexts of the supracontext and take
different outcomes.

particle hydrodynamic simulations of major galaxy mergers with new
implementations of BH accretion and feedback. The effect of BH accretion on gas
in its host galaxy is modeled by depositing momentum at a rate ~ tau L/c into
the ambient gas, where L is the luminosity produced by accretion onto the BH
and tau is the wavelength-averaged optical depth of the galactic nucleus to the
AGN's radiation (a free parameter of our model). The accretion rate onto the BH
is relatively independent of our subgrid accretion model and is instead
determined by the BH's dynamical impact on its host galaxy: BH accretion is
thus self-regulated rather than `supply limited.' We show that the final BH
mass and total stellar mass formed during a merger are more robust predictions
of the simulations than the time dependence of the star formation rate or BH
accretion rate. In particular, the latter depend on the assumed interstellar
medium physics, which determines when and where the gas fragments to form star
clusters; this in turn affects the fuel available for further star formation
and BH growth. Simulations over a factor of ~ 30 in galaxy mass are consistent
with the observed M_BH-sigma relation for a mean optical depth of tau ~ 25.
This requires that most BH growth occur when the galactic nucleus is optically
thick to far-infrared radiation, consistent with the hypothesized connection
between ultra-luminous infrared galaxies and quasars. We find tentative
evidence for a shallower M_BH-sigma relation in the lowest mass galaxies, sigma
< 100 km/s. Our results demonstrate that feedback-regulated BH growth and
consistency with the observed M_BH-sigma relation do not require that BH
feedback terminate star formation in massive galaxies or unbind large
quantities of cold gas.

with a consistent treatment of thermal effects in the equation of state. In
particular we focus on the implications for observable consequences of merger
events like the gravitational-wave signal. It is found that the characteristic
gravitational-wave oscillation frequencies of the post-merger remnant differ by
about 50 to 250 Hz (corresponding to frequency shifts of 2 to 8 per cent)
depending on the equation of state and the choice of the characteristic index
of the ideal-gas component. In addition, the delay time to black hole collapse
of the merger remnant as well as the amount of matter remaining outside the
black hole after its formation are sensitive to the description of thermal
effects.

  Dimensional Graphical Models",,,,,"stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A challenging problem in estimating high-dimensional graphical models is to
choose the regularization parameter in a data-dependent way. The standard
techniques include $K$-fold cross-validation ($K$-CV), Akaike information
criterion (AIC), and Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Though these methods
work well for low-dimensional problems, they are not suitable in high
dimensional settings. In this paper, we present StARS: a new stability-based
method for choosing the regularization parameter in high dimensional inference
for undirected graphs. The method has a clear interpretation: we use the least
amount of regularization that simultaneously makes a graph sparse and
replicable under random sampling. This interpretation requires essentially no
conditions. Under mild conditions, we show that StARS is partially sparsistent
in terms of graph estimation: i.e. with high probability, all the true edges
will be included in the selected model even when the graph size diverges with
the sample size. Empirically, the performance of StARS is compared with the
state-of-the-art model selection procedures, including $K$-CV, AIC, and BIC, on
both synthetic data and a real microarray dataset. StARS outperforms all these
competing procedures.

exist in the initial configuration. The structure of the code is modular and
allows the appropriate treatment of more physical phenomena, such as stellar

uses GRAPE-6, could be replaced by another module that uses other
accelerating-hardware like the Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). Appropriate
choice of the free parameters give a good accuracy and speed for simulations of
star clusters up to and beyond core collapse. Simulations of Plummer models
consisting of equal-mass stars reached core collapse at t~17 half-mass
relaxation times, which compares very well with existing results, while the
cumulative relative error in the energy remained below 0.001. Also, comparisons
with published results of other codes for the time of core collapse for
different initial conditions, show excellent agreement. Simulations of King
models with an initial mass-function, similar to those found in the literature,
reached core collapse at t~0.17, which is slightly smaller than the expected
result from previous works. Finally, the code accuracy becomes comparable and
even better than the accuracy of existing codes, when a number of close binary
systems is dynamically created in a simulation. This is due to the high
accuracy of the method that is used for close binary and multiple sub-systems.

to establish a communication channel over one of a given large segment of
whitespace channels. Subsets of the channels are occupied in each of the local
environments surrounding Alice and Bob, as well as in the global environment
between them (Eve). In the absence of a common clock for the two parties, the
goal is to devise time-invariant (stationary) strategies minimizing the
synchronization time. This emerged from recent applications in discovery of
wireless devices.
  We model the problem as follows. There are $N$ channels, each of which is
open (unoccupied) with probability $p_1,p_2,q$ independently for Alice, Bob and
Eve respectively. Further assume that $N \gg 1/(p_1 p_2 q)$ to allow for
sufficiently many open channels. Both Alice and Bob can detect which channels
are locally open and every time-slot each of them chooses one such channel for
an attempted sync. One aims for strategies that, with high probability over the
environments, guarantee a shortest possible expected sync time depending only
on the $p_i$'s and $q$.
  Here we provide a stationary strategy for Alice and Bob with a guaranteed
expected sync time of $O(1 / (p_1 p_2 q^2))$ given that each party also has
knowledge of $p_1,p_2,q$. When the parties are oblivious of these
probabilities, analogous strategies incur a cost of a poly-log factor, i.e.\
$\tilde{O}(1 / (p_1 p_2 q^2))$. Furthermore, this performance guarantee is
essentially optimal as we show that any stationary strategies of Alice and Bob
have an expected sync time of at least $\Omega(1/(p_1 p_2 q^2))$.

  Volatility models",,,,,"q-fin.PR math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We show that in a large class of stochastic volatility models with additional
skew-functions (local-stochastic volatility models) the tails of the cumulative
distribution of the log-returns behave as exp(-c|y|), where c is a positive
constant depending on time and on model parameters. We obtain this estimate
proving a stronger result: using some estimates for the probability that Ito
processes remain around a deterministic curve from Bally et al. '09, we lower
bound the probability that the couple (X,V) remains around a two-dimensional
curve up to a given maturity, X being the log-return process and V its
instantaneous variance. Then we find the optimal curve leading to the bounds on
the terminal cdf. The method we rely on does not require inversion of
characteristic functions but works for general coefficients of the underlying
SDE (in particular, no affine structure is needed). Even though the involved
constants are less sharp than the ones derived for stochastic volatility models
with a particular structure, our lower bounds entail moment explosion, thus
implying that Black-Scholes implied volatility always displays wings in the
considered class of models. In a second part of this paper, using Malliavin
calculus techniques, we show that an analogous estimate holds for the density
of the log-returns as well.

varies continuously with the parameter $\alpha$ that defines the path, up to a
critical value $\alpha= \alpha_c$; on the other hand for $\alpha \geq

dynamically generated and {\it path($\alpha$)-dependent} effective critical
exponents associated with the quasicritical points lying close to the MCP (on
the ferromagnetic side), where the energy-gap is minimum, lead to this
continuously varying exponent. The scaling relations are established using the
integrable transverse XY spin chain and generalized to a MCP associated with a
$d$-dimensional quantum many-body systems (not reducible to two-level systems)
using adiabatic perturbation theory. We also calculate the effective {\it

cosmology. The first step to reveal its nature is to detect the evolution of
dark energy or to prove beyond doubt that the cosmological constant is indeed
constant. However, in the standard approach to cosmology, the Universe is
described by the homogeneous and isotropic Friedmann models. Here we show that
in the perturbed universe (even if perturbations vanish if averaged over
sufficiently large scales) the distance-redshift relation is not the same as in
the unperturbed universe. This has a serious consequence when studying the
nature of dark energy and, as shown here, can impair the analysis and studies
of dark energy. The analysis is based on two methods: the linear lensing
approximation and the non-linear Szekeres Swiss-Cheese model. The inhomogeneity
scale is ~50 Mpc, and both models have the same density fluctuations along the
line of sight. The comparison between linear and non-linear methods shows that
non-linear corrections are not negligible. When inhomogeneities are present the
distance changes by several percent. To show how this change influences the
measurements of dark energy, ten future observations with 2% uncertainties are
generated. It is shown the using the standard methods (i.e. under the
assumption of homogeneity) the systematics due to inhomogeneities can distort
our analysis, and may lead to a conclusion that dark energy evolves when in
fact it is constant (or vice versa). Therefore, if future observations are
analysed only within the homogeneous framework then the impact of
inhomogeneities (such as voids and superclusters) can be mistaken for evolving
dark energy. Since the robust distinction between the evolution and
non-evolution of dark energy is the first step to understanding the nature of
dark energy a proper handling of inhomogeneities is essential.

tensor in the boundary theory. We show that, if treated appropriately,
different ways of prescribing asymptotically AdS_3 boundary conditions yield
finite conserved charges for the solutions. The consistency of the construction
manifests itself in that the charges of hairy asymptotically AdS_3 black holes
computed by this holography-inspired method exactly match the values required
for the Cardy formula to reproduce the black hole entropy. We also consider new
solutions to the equations of motion of New Massive Gravity, which happen to
fulfill Brown-Henneaux boundary conditions despite not being Einstein

contributions of the paper are theorems which provide concise formulas for
optimal transmit power, beamforming vectors, and achieved signal to

obtained are valid for the limit in which the number of users per cell, K, and
the number of antennas per base station, N, tend to infinity, with fixed ratio.

The objective of a multicast routing protocol for MANETs is to support the
propagation of data from a sender to all the receivers of a multicast group
while trying to use the available bandwidth efficiently in the presence of
frequent topology changes. Multicasting can improve the efficiency of the
wireless link when sending multiple copies of messages by exploiting the
inherent broadcast property of wireless transmission. Secure multicast routing
plays a significant role in MANETs. However, offering energy efficient and
secure multicast routing is a difficult and challenging task. In recent years,

  Inapproximability Results for Every Bounded-Degree CSP",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Raghavendra (STOC 2008) gave an elegant and surprising result: if Khot's
Unique Games Conjecture (STOC 2002) is true, then for every constraint
satisfaction problem (CSP), the best approximation ratio is attained by a
certain simple semidefinite programming and a rounding scheme for it. In this
paper, we show that similar results hold for constant-time approximation
algorithms in the bounded-degree model. Specifically, we present the
followings: (i) For every CSP, we construct an oracle that serves an access, in
constant time, to a nearly optimal solution to a basic LP relaxation of the
CSP. (ii) Using the oracle, we give a constant-time rounding scheme that
achieves an approximation ratio coincident with the integrality gap of the
basic LP. (iii) Finally, we give a generic conversion from integrality gaps of
basic LPs to hardness results. All of those results are \textit{unconditional}.
Therefore, for every bounded-degree CSP, we give the best constant-time
approximation algorithm among all. A CSP instance is called $\epsilon$-far from
satisfiability if we must remove at least an $\epsilon$-fraction of constraints
to make it satisfiable. A CSP is called testable if there is a constant-time
algorithm that distinguishes satisfiable instances from $\epsilon$-far
instances with probability at least $2/3$. Using the results above, we also
derive, under a technical assumption, an equivalent condition under which a CSP
is testable in the bounded-degree model.

($R^{<}_{\sim} 10h_{71}^{-1}$ kpc) gas entropy excess ($\Delta K_{0}$), which
corresponds to $\simeq 0.1-0.5$ keV per gas particle, beyond the power-law
model that best fits the radial entropy profile of outer regions. We also find
a distinct correlation between the central entropy excess $\Delta K_{0}$ and
$K$-band luminosity $L_{K}$ of the central dominating galaxies (CDGs), which is
scaled as $\Delta K_{0} \propto L_{K}^{1.6\pm0.4}$, where $L_{K}$ is tightly
associated with the mass of the supermassive black hole hosted in the CDG. In
fact, if an effective mass-to-energy conversion-efficiency of 0.02 is assumed
for the accretion process, the cumulative AGN feedback $E^{\rm AGN}_{\rm
feedback} \simeq \eta M_{\rm BH}c^{2}$ yields an extra heating of $\simeq
0.5-17.0$ keV per particle, which is sufficient to explain the central entropy
excess. In most cases the AGN contribution can compensate the radiative loss of
the X-ray gas within the cooling radius ($\simeq 0.002-2.2$ keV per particle),
and apparently exceeds the energy required to deviate the scaling relations
from the self-similar predictions ($\simeq 0.2-1.0$ keV per particle). In
contrast to the AGN feedback, the extra heating provided by supernova
explosions accounts for $\simeq 0.01-0.08$ keV per particle in groups and is
almost negligible in clusters. Therefore, the observed correlation between
$\Delta K_{0}$ and $L_{K}$ can be considered as a direct evidence for AGN
feedback in galaxy groups and clusters.

clean initial state and the comparatively benign environment of a lepton
collider are ideally suited to high precision measurements. To take full
advantage of the physics potential of ILC places great demands on the detector
performance. The design of ILD is driven by these requirements. Excellent
calorimetry and tracking are combined to obtain the best possible overall event
reconstruction, including the capability to reconstruct individual particles
within jets for particle ow calorimetry. This requires excellent spatial
resolution for all detector systems. A highly granular calorimeter system is
combined with a central tracker which stresses redundancy and efficiency. In

resolution for charged particles are essential for an ILC detector. The
interaction region of the ILC is designed to host two detectors, which can be
moved into the beam position with a push-pull scheme. The mechanical design of

galaxies is possible during major mergers of cluster of galaxies, based on new
numerical simulations of the time evolution of the physical properties of the
intracluster medium (ICM) during such a merger event. Our numerical simulations
show that the external pressure of the ICM in which cluster member galaxies are
embedded, can increase significantly during cluster merging. As such, efficient
star formation can be triggered in gas-rich members as a result of the strong
compression of their cold gas by the increased pressure. We also suggest that
these star-forming galaxies can subsequently be transformed into poststarburst
galaxies, with their spatial distribution within the cluster being different to
the rest of its population. We discuss whether this possible merger-induced
enhancement in the number of star-forming and post-star-forming cluster
galaxies is consistent with the observed evolution of galaxies in merging
clusters.

Interestingly, heavy particles which exist in the three site Higgsless model do
not completely decouple in the heavy-mass limit. One-loop level b -> s gamma

from a brane world inspired cosmology, it is found that the derived Hubble
relation of theremaining models reproduce the $\Lambda$CDM results

order to attempt distinguish the different dark energy models from the

equivalent to those of the $\Lambda$CDM model, as far as the expected cluster

structure in Saturn's A and B-ring, which take the form of periodic
microstructure on the 0.1 km scale, and irregular larger-scale structure on
1-10 km. Nonlinear wavetrains dominate all the simulations, and we associate
them with the observed periodic microstructure. The waves can undergo small
chaotic fluctuations in their phase and amplitude, and may be punctuated by
more formidable `wave defects' distributed on longer scales. It is unclear,
however, whether the defects are connected to the irregular larger-scale
variations observed by Cassini. The long-term behaviour of the simulations is
dominated by the imposed boundary conditions, and more generally by the
limitations of the local model we use: the shearing box. When periodic boundary
conditions are imposed, the system eventually settles on a uniform travelling
wave of a predictable wavelength, while reflecting boundaries, and boundaries
with buffer zones, maintain a disordered state. The simulations omit
self-gravity, though we examine its influence in future work.

intermittently connected networks whereas Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET)
protocols address the fairly stable and fully connected ones. But many
intermediate situations may occur on mobility dynamics or radio link
instability. In such cases, where the network frequently splits into evolving
connected groups, none of the conventional routing paradigms (DTN or MANET) are
fully satisfactory. In this paper we propose HYMAD, a Hybrid DTN-MANET routing
protocol which uses DTN between disjoint groups of nodes while using MANET
routing within these groups. HYMAD is fully decentralized and only makes use of
topological information exchanges between the nodes. The strength of HYMAD lies
in its ability to adapt to the changing connectivity patterns of the network.
We evaluate the scheme in simulation by replaying synthetic and real life
mobility traces which exhibit a broad range of connectivity dynamics. The
results show that HYMAD introduces limited overhead and outperforms the
multi-copy Spray-and-Wait DTN routing protocol it extends, both in terms of
delivery ratio and delay. This hybrid DTN-MANET approach offers a promising
venue for the delivery of elastic data in mobile ad-hoc networks as it retains
the resilience of a \textit{pure} DTN protocol while significantly improving
performance.

the scenario how to prevent it' (Moscow, URSS, 2009, bibl.571). While consuming
energy, we finally practically all the produced energy is dissipated as heat.
As the way of preventing the ""thermal death"" the author suggests that we should
transit to the thermocyclic power engineering based on using heat circulation
and build ""cold storage plants"" which must collect the dissipated heat and
transform it into forms of energy necessary to mankind. As a rule the
dissipated heat has low temperature gradients. For this reason the efficiency
of ""cold storage plants"" of the classic type (with coolers) is too small and
therefore they cannot be used as the basis of thermocyclic power engineering.
This fact makes us consider the perpetual motion engines of the second kind.
Having analyzed (excessively) numerous formulations of the Second Law of
thermodynamics, the author has concluded that the prohibition of these engines
is groundless. From the author's point of view this prohibition is a
consequence of the following mistakes made by the founders of Thermodynamics.
1. Having in mind the concept of non-exterminable phlogiston, S. Carnot made a
conclusion that the heat does not disappear but is only transferred from a warm
body to a cold one and therefore a cooler is necessary for any thermal engine.
However, today we know that while heat is consumed, it does disappear as heat
and converts into other forms of energy. Hence, Carnot's argumentation is
wrong. 2.The Entropy Increase Law is wrongly reduced to the Thermal Entropy
Increase ""Law"" while in Nature the Total Entropy Increase Law works. Due to
groundlessness of the Thermal Entropy Increase ""Law"", the thermal entropy can
decrease and a compensation of converting thermal energy into mechanical work
can be non-thermal. Therefore a cooler is not necessary for a thermal engine.

that the trace of the (fractional) q-deformed KS monodromy is given by the
characters of 2d conformal field theories associated to the corresponding TBA
(i.e. integrable deformations of the generalized parafermionic systems). The

and Lifshitz, one might at first glance understand that when the given period
is very short, waves are isentropic because heat conduction does not set in,
while if the given period is very long waves are isothermal because there is
enough time for thermalization to be thoroughly accomplished. When one pursues
the study of these waves further, by the mathematical inspection of the
complete thermoelastic wave equation he finds that if the period is very short,
much shorter than a characteristic time of the material, the wave is
isothermal, while if it is very long, much longer than the characteristic time,
the wave is isentropic. One also learns that this fact is supported by
experiments: at low frequencies the elastic waves are isentropic, while they
are isothermal when the frequencies are so high that can be attained in few
cases. The authors show that there is no contradiction between the first glance
understanding and the mathematical treatment of the elastic wave equation: for
thermal effects very long periods are so short and very short periods are so
long.

suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus. In physiological conditions, the
system of neurons is very efficiently entrained by the 24-hour light-dark
cycle. Most of the studies carried out so far emphasize the crucial role of the
periodicity imposed by the light dark cycle in neuronal synchronization.
Nevertheless, heterogeneity as a natural and permanent ingredient of these
cellular interactions is seemingly to play a major role in these biochemical
processes. In this paper we use a model that considers the neurons of the
suprachiasmatic nucleus as chemically-coupled modified Goodwin oscillators, and
introduce non-negligible heterogeneity in the periods of all neurons in the
form of quenched noise. The system response to the light-dark cycle periodicity
is studied as a function of the interneuronal coupling strength, external
forcing amplitude and neuronal heterogeneity. Our results indicate that the
right amount of heterogeneity helps the extended system to respond globally in
a more coherent way to the external forcing. Our proposed mechanism for
neuronal synchronization under external periodic forcing is based on
heterogeneity-induced oscillators death, damped oscillators being more
entrainable by the external forcing than the self-oscillating neurons with
different periods.

spectroscopic signatures including narrow absorption lines, broad emission
lines and a Compton hump. The formation of these features is complex with
contributions originating from many of the different structures present in the
hydrodynamical simulation. In particular, spectral features are shaped both by
gas in a successfully launched outflow and in complex flows where material is
lifted out of the disk plane but ultimately falls back. We also confirm that
the strong Fe Kalpha line can develop a weak, red-skewed line wing as a result
of Compton scattering in the outflow. In addition, we demonstrate that X-ray

space scanning, different parts of the images (sectors of spectrograms)

Stochastic orbits enable ions to absorb energy from the turbulence, increasing
the perpendicular ion temperature even when the fluctuation frequencies are too
small for a cyclotron resonance to occur. In this paper, an analytic expression
for the stochastic heating rate is used in conjunction with an observationally
constrained turbulence model to obtain an analytic formula for the

observations of protons and OVI ions at 2Rs < r < 3Rs from the Ultraviolet

explanation for several detailed features of the UVCS observations, including
the preferential and anisotropic heating of minor ions, the rapid radial
increase in the OVI temperature between 1.6Rs and 1.9Rs, and the abrupt
flattening of the OVI temperature profile as r increases above 1.9Rs.

of Fiedler et al. [PRL 98, 114101 (2007)], who demonstrated that such feedback
control can stabilize the UPO associated with a two-dimensional subcritical
Hopf normal form. Pyragas feedback requires an appropriate choice of a feedback
gain matrix for stabilization, as well as knowledge of the period of the
targeted UPO. We apply feedback in the directions tangent to the
two-dimensional center manifold. We parameterize the feedback gain by a modulus
and a phase angle, and give explicit formulae for choosing these two parameters
given the period of the UPO in a neighborhood of the bifurcation point. We
show, first heuristically, and then rigorously by a center manifold reduction
for delay differential equations, that the stabilization mechanism involves a
highly degenerate Hopf bifurcation problem that is induced by the time-delayed
feedback. When the feedback gain modulus reaches a threshold for stabilization,
both of the genericity assumptions associated with a two-dimensional Hopf
bifurcation are violated: the eigenvalues of the linearized problem do not
cross the imaginary axis as the bifurcation parameter is varied, and the real
part of the cubic coefficient of the normal form vanishes. Our analysis of this
degenerate bifurcation problem reveals two qualitatively distinct cases when
unfolded in a two-parameter plane. In each case, Pyragas-type feedback
successfully stabilizes the branch of small-amplitude UPOs in a neighborhood of
the original bifurcation point, provided that the phase angle satisfies a
certain restriction.

the following ways:
  - by reducing the amount of code that has to be written to construct an
application;
  - by increasing the reliability of the code written; and
  - by improving the programmer's understanding of the persistent environment
in which applications are constructed. Two programming techniques that may be
used to pursue these goals in a persistent environment are type-safe linguistic
reflection and hyper-programming. The first provides a mechanism by which the
programmer can write generators that, when executed, produce new program
representations. This allows the specification of programs that are highly
generic yet depend in non-trivial ways on the types of the data on which they
operate. Genericity promotes software reuse which in turn reduces the amount of
new code that has to be written. Hyper-programming allows a source program to
contain links to data items in the persistent store. This improves program
reliability by allowing certain program checking to be performed earlier than
is otherwise possible. It also reduces the amount of code written by permitting
direct links to data in the place of textual descriptions. Both techniques
contribute to the understanding of the persistent environment through
supporting the implementation of store browsing tools and allowing source
representations to be associated with all executable programs in the persistent
store. This thesis describes in detail the structure of type-safe linguistic
reflection and hyper-programming, their benefits in the persistent context, and
a suite of programming tools that support reflective programming and
hyper-programming. These tools may be used in conjunction to allow reflection
over hyper-program representations. The implementation of the tools is

theoretically the dynamical effects of such lensing-X-ray offsets, and compare
with observational data. We find that for typical values, the offset alone can
give rise to a factor of two difference between the lensing and X-ray

formula for the entropy. Previous results obtained separately in topological
massive gravity and in new massive gravity are recovered as special cases.

pump-probe optical reflectivity. After ultrafast photoexcitation, hot electrons
were found to relax with two different characteristic times, indicating the
presence of two distinct decay channels: a faster one, of less than 1 ps in the
considered pump fluence range, and a slower one, corresponding to lattice
thermalization and lasting ~6 ps. Our analysis indicates that the fast
relaxation should be attributed to preferential scattering of the electrons
with only a subset of the lattice vibration modes, with a second moment of the
Eliashberg function lambda(omega^2)~64 meV^2. The simultaneous excitation of a
strong fully symmetric A(1g) optical phonon corroborates this conclusion and
makes it possible to deduce the value of lambda~0.12. This small value for the
electron-phonon coupling confirms that a phonon mediated process cannot be the
only mechanism leading to the formation of superconducting pairs in this family
of pnictides.

Proving such conjectures is extremely difficult since the gauge and string
theory perturbative regimes do not overlap. In this perspective, the discovery
of infinitely many conserved charges, i.e. the integrability, in the planar
AdS/CFT has allowed us to reach immense progresses in understanding and
confirming the duality. We review the fundamental concepts and properties of
integrability in two-dimensional sigma-models and in the AdS/CFT context. The
first part is focused on the AdS_5/CFT_4 duality, especially the classical and
quantum integrability of the type IIB superstring on AdS_5 x S^5 are discussed
in both pure spinor and Green-Schwarz formulations. The second part is
dedicated to the AdS_4/CFT_3 duality with particular attention to the type IIA
superstring on AdS_4 x CP^3 and its integrability. This review is based on a
shortened and revised version of the author's PhD thesis, discussed at Uppsala

more confused and uniform) in harder and harder energy bands or lines. We
explain this evidence as due to the fine multi-temperature structure of coronal
loops. To this end, we model bundles of loops made of thin strands, each heated
by short and intense heat pulses. For simplicity, we assume that the heat
pulses are all equal and triggered only once in each strand at a random time.
The pulse intensity and cadence are selected so as to have steady active region
loops ($\sim 3$ MK), on the average. We compute the evolution of the confined
heated plasma with a hydrodynamic loop model. We then compute the emission
along each strand in several spectral lines, from cool ($\leq 1$ MK), to warm
($2-3$ MK) lines, detectable with Hinode/EIS, to hot X-ray lines. The strands
are then put side-by-side to construct an active region loop bundle. We find
that in the warm lines ($2-3$ MK) the loop emission fills all the available
image surface. Therefore the emission appears quite uniform and it is difficult
to resolve the single loops, while in the cool lines the loops are considerably
more contrasted and the region is less fuzzy. The main reasons for this effect
are that, during their evolution, i.e. pulse heating and slow cooling, each
strand spends a relatively long time at temperatures around $2-3$ MK, and that
it has a high emission measure during that phase, so the whole region appears
more uniform or smudged. We make the prediction that the fuzziness should be
reduced in the hot UV and X-ray lines.

how their combined use succeeds in obtaining a detailed description of purely

of the climate impact of ocean transport processes, we illustrate a 2D
application on altimeter data sets over the area of the Kuroshio Current,
although the proposed techniques are general and applicable to arbitrary time
dependent aperiodic flows. The first challenge for describing transport in
aperiodical time dependent flows is obtaining a representation of the phase
portrait where the most relevant dynamical features may be identified. This
representation is accomplished by using global Lagrangian descriptors that when
applied for instance to the altimeter data sets retrieve over the ocean surface
a phase portrait where the geometry of interconnected dynamical systems is
visible. The phase portrait picture is essential because it evinces which
transport routes are acting on the whole flow. Once these routes are roughly
recognised it is possible to complete a detailed description by the direct
computation of the finite time stable and unstable manifolds of special
hyperbolic trajectories that act as organising centres of the flow.

geometry whose moduli space is described by an arbitrary function of one
variable and is thus infinite-dimensional. This is achieved by constructing the
scalar Green function on a simple D6 anti-D6 background, and using this Green
function to obtain the fully back-reacted solution for a supertube with varying
charge density in this background. We show that this supertube can store
parametrically more entropy than in flat space, confirming the entropy
enhancement mechanism that was predicted using brane probes. We also show that
all the local properties of the fully back-reacted solution can, in fact, be
obtained using the DBI action of an appropriate brane probe. In particular, the
supergravity and the DBI analysis yield identical functional bubble equations
that govern the relative locations of the centers. This indicates that there is
a non-renormalization theorem that protects these functional equations as one
moves in moduli space. Our construction creates configurations that are beyond
the scope of recent arguments that appear to put strong limits on the entropy
that can be found in smooth supergravity solutions.

one-body N-currents with relativistic corrections and two-body currents
consistent with the Argonne V18 potential. $R_T$ is calculated for the breakup
threshold region at momentum transfers near 900 MeV/c. Our results are similar

enhancement of neutrino oscillations in the matter appears. It is shown that
Wolfenstein's equation, for neutrino passing through the matter, contains a
disadvantage (does not take into account the law of momentum conservation). It
leads, for example, to changing of the effective mass of neutrino by the value
of $0.87 \cdot 10^{-2} eV$ from the very small value of the energy polarization
of the matter caused by neutrino which is equal to $5 \cdot 10^{-12} eV$. After
removing this disadvantage (i.e., taking into account this law) we have
obtained a solution of this equation. In this solution a very small enhancement
of neutrino oscillations in the matter appears due to the smallness of the
energy polarization of the matter caused by neutrino.
