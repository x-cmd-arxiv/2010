massive particles (WIMPs) of mass 5-50 GeV and test these models against
helioseismic constraints on sound speed, convection zone depth, convection zone
helium abundance, and small separations of low-degree p-modes. Our main
conclusion is that both direct detection experiments and particle accelerators
may be complemented by using the Sun as a probe for WIMP DM particles in the
5-50 GeV mass range. The DM most sensitive to this probe has suppressed
annihilations and a large spin-dependent elastic scattering cross section. For
the WIMP cross-section parameters explored here, the lightest WIMP masses <10
GeV are ruled out by constraints on core sound speed and low-degree frequency
spacings. For WIMP masses 30-50 GeV, the changes to the solar structure are
confined to the inner 4% of the solar radius and so do not significantly affect
the solar p-modes. Future helioseismology observations, most notably involving
g-modes, and future solar neutrino experiments may be able to constrain the
allowable DM parameter space in a mass range that is of current interest for
direct detection.

We show that in such a situation gravity does not require any independent
quantization of its own, with it being quantized simply by virtue of its being
coupled to the quantized matter fields that serve as its source. We show that
when the gravitational and matter fields possess an underlying conformal
symmetry, the gravitational field and fermionic matter-field zero-point
fluctuations cancel each other identically. Then, when the fermions acquire
mass by a dynamical symmetry breaking procedure that induces a cosmological
constant in such conformal theories, the zero-point fluctuations readjust so as
to cancel the induced cosmological constant identically. The zero-point vacuum
problem and the cosmological constant vacuum problems thus mutually solve each
other. We illustrate our ideas in a completely solvable conformal-invariant
model, namely two-dimensional quantum Einstein gravity coupled to a
Nambu-Jona-Lasinio self-consistent fermion.

nm and 22 K with infrared spectroscopy and microgravimetry. Photolysis of pure
ozone destroyed O3, but a small amount of ozone remained in the film at high
fluence. Photolysis of pure O2 produced O3 in an amount that increased with
photon fluence to a stationary level. For both O2 and O3 films, the O3:O2 ratio
at saturation is 0.03, nearly 10-30 times larger than those obtained in gas
phase photolysis. This enhancement is attributed to the increased
photodissociation of O2 due to photoabsorption by O2 dimers, a process
significant at solid state densities. We obtain initial quantum yield for ozone
synthesis from solid oxygen, {\Phi} (O3) = 0.18 and for destruction of ozone
and oxygen in their parent solids, {\Phi} (- O3) = 1.7 and {\Phi} (-O2) = 0.28.
Combined with known photoabsorption cross sections, we estimate probabilities
for germinate recombination of 0.15 for O3 fragments and 0.90 for oxygen atoms
from O2 dissociation. Using a two-parameter kinetic model, we deduce the
average probabilities for the reaction of an O atom with O2 and O3 to be 0.10
and 1, respectively. These probabilities are the same for both O2 and O3 films,
even though the distribution of kinetic and internal energy of the
photofragments is very different in both cases. This finding suggests efficient
energy relaxation of photofragments in the solid occur prior to their reactions
with other species.

local spin density approximation (LSDA) and the generalized gradient

calculations reveal the existence of ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic
(AFM) states over a wide range of lattice constants. At 3.12\,{\AA} in the GGA,
the equilibrium state is found to be AFM with a local Fe magnetic moment of
$\pm 2.69\,\mu_\mathrm{B}$. A metastable FM state with Fe and Se local magnetic
moments of $2.00\,\mu_\mathrm{B}$ and $-0.032\,\mu_\mathrm{B}$, respectively,
lies 171.7\,{meV} above the AFM state. Its equilibrium lattice constant is
$\sim 2$\,{\%} smaller than that of the AFM state, implying that when the
system undergoes a phase transition from the AFM state to the FM one, the
transition is accompanied by volume contraction. Such an AFM-FM transition is
attributed to spin-density $z$-reflection symmetry; the symmetry driven AFM-FM
transition is not altered by spin-orbit coupling. The relative stability of
different magnetic phases is discussed in terms of the local density of states.
We find that CsCl-type FeSe is mechanically stable, but the magnetic states are
expected to be brittle.

well as the leading low temperature dependence for the resistivity, are
obtained by working to second order in the renormalized couplings. A universal
relation is obtained between the renormalized parameters, independent of n, in
the Kondo regime. An expression for the dynamic spin susceptibility is also
derived by taking into account repeated quasiparticle scattering, which is
asymptotically exact in the low frequency regime and satisfies the
Korringa-Shiba relation. The renormalized parameters, including the
renormalized Hund's rule coupling, are deduced from numerical renormalization
group calculations for the model for the case n=2. The results confirm
explicitly the universal relations between the parameters in the Kondo regime.

These types of structured metadata provide valuable evidence for learning how a

users in visualizing and browsing social content, and also to help them in
organizing their own content. However, learning from social metadata presents
several challenges, since it is sparse, shallow, ambiguous, noisy, and
inconsistent. We describe an approach to folksonomy learning based on
relational clustering, which exploits structured metadata contained in personal
hierarchies. Our approach clusters similar hierarchies using their structure
and tag statistics, then incrementally weaves them into a deeper, bushier tree.
We study folksonomy learning using social metadata extracted from the

the challenges. Moreover, comparing to previous work, the approach produces
larger, more accurate folksonomies, and in addition, scales better.

Observatory`s submillimetre camera and spectrometer. It contains a three-band
imaging photometer operating at 250, 350 and 500 microns, and an imaging
Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) which covers simultaneously its whole
operating range of 194-671 microns (447-1550 GHz). The SPIRE detectors are
arrays of feedhorn-coupled bolometers cooled to 0.3 K. The photometer has a
field of view of 4' x 8', observed simultaneously in the three spectral bands.
Its main operating mode is scan-mapping, whereby the field of view is scanned
across the sky to achieve full spatial sampling and to cover large areas if
desired. The spectrometer has an approximately circular field of view with a
diameter of 2.6'. The spectral resolution can be adjusted between 1.2 and 25
GHz by changing the stroke length of the FTS scan mirror. Its main operating
mode involves a fixed telescope pointing with multiple scans of the FTS mirror
to acquire spectral data. For extended source measurements, multiple position
offsets are implemented by means of an internal beam steering mirror to achieve
the desired spatial sampling and by rastering of the telescope pointing to map
areas larger than the field of view. The SPIRE instrument consists of a cold
focal plane unit located inside the Herschel cryostat and warm electronics
units, located on the spacecraft Service Module, for instrument control and
data handling. Science data are transmitted to Earth with no on-board data
compression, and processed by automatic pipelines to produce calibrated science
products. The in-flight performance of the instrument matches or exceeds
predictions based on pre-launch testing and modelling: the photometer
sensitivity is comparable to or slightly better than estimated pre-launch, and
the spectrometer sensitivity is also better by a factor of 1.5-2.

for the 12 spectroscopically confirmed and 80 photometrically selected members,
we discover an exceptionally high level of star formation in the cluster core

in (U-V) color and span a range in color. We identify 17 members with
L(IR)>10^(11) Lsun, and these IR luminous members follow the same trend of
increasing star formation with stellar mass that is observed in the field at
z~2. Using rates derived from both the 24 micron imaging and SED fitting, we
find that the relative fraction of star-forming members triples from the lowest
to highest galaxy density regions, e.g. the IR luminous fraction increases from
~8% at Sigma~10 gal per Mpc^2 to ~25% at Sigma>100 gal per Mpc^2. The observed
increase is a reversal of the well-documented trend at z<1 and signals that we

substantial fraction of their stars.

are from the same authority and their users have common goals. The application
of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) as open networks has emerged recently but
proliferated exponentially. Energy is a valuable commodity in MANETs due to the
limited battery of the portable devices. Batteries typically cannot be replaced
in MANETs, making their lifetime limited. Diverse users, with unlike goals,
share the resources of their devices and ensuring global connectivity comes
very low in their priority. This sort of communities can already be found in
wired networks, namely on peer-to-peer networks. In this scenario, open MANETs
will likely resemble social environments. A group of persons can provide
benefits to each of its members as long as everyone provides his contribution.
For our particular case, each element of a MANET will be called to forward
messages and to participate on routing protocols. A selfish behavior threatens
the entire community and also this behavior is infectious as, other MDs may
also start to perform in the same way. In the extreme, this can take to the
complete sabotage of the network. This paper investigates the prevalent

standard Randall-Sundrum compactifications, where instead of an infrared brane
one has a curvature singularity (with vanishing warp factor) at finite proper
distance in the bulk. We project the physics near the singularity onto a
hypersurface located a small distance away from it in the bulk. This results in
a completely equivalent description of the soft wall in terms of an effective
infrared brane, hiding any singular point. We perform explicitly this
calculation for two classes of soft wall backgrounds used in the literature.
The procedure has several advantages. It separates in a clean way the physics
of the soft wall from the physics of the five dimensional bulk, facilitating a
more direct comparison with standard two-brane warped compactifications.
Moreover, consistent soft walls show a sort of universal behavior near the
singularity which is reflected in the effective brane Lagrangian. Thirdly, for
many purposes, a good approximation is obtained by assuming the bulk background
away from the singularity to be the usual Randall-Sundrum metric, thus making
the soft wall backgrounds better analytically tractable. We check the validity
of this procedure by calculating the spectrum of bulk fields and comparing it
to the exact result, finding very good agreement.

mapping to $f$ under the Shimura correspondence. Furthermore, by the work of
Waldspurger the Fourier coefficients of such a form are related to the
quadratic twists of the form $f$. Gross gave a construction of the half
integral weight form when $N$ is prime, and such construction was later
generalized to square-free levels. However, in the non-square free case, the
situation is more complicated since the natural construction is vacuous. The
problem being that there are too many special points so that there is
cancellation while trying to encode the information as a linear combination of
theta series.
  In this paper, we concentrate in the case of level $p^2$, for $p>2$ a prime

(indexed by bilateral ideals for an order of reduced discriminant $p^2$) which
gives two weight $3/2$ modular forms mapping to $f$ under the Shimura

allows to prove that the forms are indeed a linear combination of theta series

function of both rapidity and the coherence momentum. In Deep Inelastic
Scattering this will lead to a dependence of the saturation scale on the photon
virtuality in addition to the usual x-Bjorken dependence. At asymptotic
energies the interplay between the perturbative non-linear physics, and that of
the QCD coherence, leads to an interesting and novel dynamics where the
saturation momentum itself eventually saturates. We also investigate various

right-handed gauge boson from the K mass difference, M_WR>2.5TeV, is subject to
a possible small reduction due to the difference between right and left Cabibbo
angles. In the case of charge conjugation the limit on M_WR is somewhat more
robust. However, the more severe bounds from CP-violating observables are
absent in this case. In fact, the free phases can also resolve the present mild
discrepancy between the Standard Model and CP-violation in the $B$-sector.

disk around LkCa 15, revealing the surrounding nebulosity. We detect sharp
elliptical contours delimiting the nebulosity on the inside as well as the
outside, consistent with the shape, size, ellipticity, and orientation of
starlight reflected from the far-side disk wall, whereas the near-side wall is
shielded from view by the disk's optically thick bulk. We note that
forward-scattering of starlight on the near-side disk surface could provide an
alternate interpretation of the nebulosity. In either case, this discovery
provides confirmation of the disk geometry that has been proposed to explain
the spectral energy distributions (SED) of such systems, comprising an
optically thick outer disk with an inner truncation radius of ~46 AU enclosing
a largely evacuated gap. Our data show an offset of the nebulosity contours
along the major axis, likely corresponding to a physical pericenter offset of
the disk gap. This reinforces the leading theory that dynamical clearing by at
least one orbiting body is the cause of the gap. Based on evolutionary models,
our high-contrast imagery imposes an upper limit of 21 Jupiter masses on
companions at separations outside of 0.1"" and of 13 Jupiter masses outside of
0.2"". Thus, we find that a planetary system around LkCa 15 is the most likely
explanation for the disk architecture.

direction of the gravitational wave source, (b) the timing accuracy of the
pulsars in the array and (c) how the available observing time is allocated
among those pulsars. Here, we present a simple way to calculate the sensitivity
of the PTA as a function of direction of a single GW source, based only on the
location and root-mean-square residual of the pulsars in the array. We use this
calculation to suggest future strategies for the current North American
Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) PTA in its goal of
detecting single GW sources. We also investigate the affects of an additional
pulsar on the array sensitivity, with the goal of suggesting where PTA pulsar
searches might be best directed. We demonstrate that, in the case of single GW
sources, if we are interested in maximizing the volume of space to which PTAs
are sensitive, there exists a slight advantage to finding a new pulsar near
where the array is already most sensitive. Further, the study suggests that
more observing time should be dedicated to the already low noise pulsars in
order to have the greatest positive effect on the PTA sensitivity. We have made
a web-based sensitivity mapping tool available at http://gwastro.psu.edu/ptasm.

circuits which satisfy two very natural assumptions. We provide a formalism
that is local in the following very specific sense: calculations pertaining to
any region of spacetime employ only mathematical objects associated with that
region. We call this ""formalism locality"". It incorporates the idea that space
and time should be treated on an equal footing. Formulations that use a
foliation of spacetime to evolve a state do not have this property nor do
histories-based approaches. An operation (see figure on left) has inputs and
outputs (through which systems travel). A circuit is built by wiring together
operations such that we have no open inputs or outputs left over. A fragment
(see figure on right) is a part of a circuit and may have open inputs and
outputs. We show how each operation is associated with a certain mathematical
object which we call a ""duotensor"" (this is like a tensor but with a bit more
structure). In the figure on the left we show how a duotensor is represented
graphically. We can link duotensors together such that black and white dots
match up to get the duotensor corresponding to any fragment. The figure on the
right is the duotensor for the above fragment. Links represent summing over the
corresponding indices. We can use such duotensors to make probabilistic
statements pertaining to fragments. Since fragments are the circuit equivalent
of arbitrary spacetime regions we have formalism locality. The probability for
a circuit is given by the corresponding duotensorial calculation (which is a
scalar since there are no indices left over). We show how to put classical
probability theory and quantum theory into this framework. [Note: the abstract

these objects are highly susceptible to triggered star formation, induced by

non-equilibrium chemistry and cooling of 14 species and including the presence
of a dissociating background, we show that shock interactions can transform
minihaloes into extremely compact clusters of coeval stars. Furthermore, these
clusters are all less than $\approx 10^6 M_\odot,$ and they are ejected from
their parent dark matter halos: properties that are remarkably similar to those

period, P =1.829 hours (f=13.118368(11) c/d), based on time-resolved optical
spectroscopy obtained at the VLT and the Magellan telescopes. We also derive an
upper limit of the velocity semi-amplitude of the white dwarf, K1 = 17.9 +/-
1.6 km/s, and estimate a mass ratio of q = 0.20 +/- 0.03. If the mass of the
donor star is estimated using the period-density relation and theoretical
main-sequence mass-radius relation for a slightly inflated donor star, we find
M2 = 0.14 +/- 0.03 Msun. This implies a mass of the primary white dwarf M1 =
0.7 +/- 0.2 Msun. If the white-dwarf mass is > 1 Msun, as classical nova models
imply, the donor mass must be even higher. We therefore rule out the
possibility that T Pyx has evolved beyond the period minimum for cataclysmic
variables. We find that the system inclination is constrained to be
approximately 10 degrees, confirming the expectation that T Pyx is a
low-inclination system. We also discuss some of the evolutionary implications
of the emerging physical picture of T Pyx. In particular, we show that epochs
of enhanced mass transfer (like the present) may accelerate or even dominate
the overall evolution of the system, even if they are relatively short-lived.
We also point out that such phases may be relevant to the evolution of

significantly biased by the blending of lower mass cores with small

method, in which large databases are used instead of experimental observations
as the necessary empirical ingredient. This change in the source of the
empirical data allows the scientific method to be applied to several aspects of
physical reality that previously resisted systematic interrogation. Under the
new method, scientific theories are compared by instantiating them as
compression programs, and examining the codelengths they achieve on a database
of measurements related to a phenomenon of interest. Because of the
impossibility of compressing random data, ""real world"" data can only be
compressed by discovering and exploiting the empirical structure it exhibits.
The method also provides a new way of thinking about two longstanding issues in
the philosophy of science: the problem of induction and the problem of
demarcation.
  The second part of the paper proposes to reformulate computer vision as an
empirical science of visual reality, by applying the new method to large
databases of natural images. The immediate goal of the proposed reformulation
is to repair the chronic difficulties in evaluation experienced by the field of
computer vision. The reformulation should bring a wide range of benefits,
including a substantially increased degree of methodological rigor, the ability
to justify complex theories without overfitting, a scalable evaluation
paradigm, and the potential to make systematic progress. A crucial argument is
that the change is not especially drastic, because most computer vision tasks
can be reformulated as specialized image compression techniques. Finally, a
concrete proposal is discussed in which a database is produced by recording
from a roadside video camera, and compression is achieved by developing a
computational understanding of the appearance of moving cars.

formal and processor network models of computation. An interstring linked with
a abstract machine environment, shares sub-expressions, transfers data, and
spatially allocates resources for the parallel evaluation of dataflow. Formal
models called the a-Ram family are introduced, designed to support interstring
programming languages (interlanguages). Distinct from dataflow, graph
rewriting, and FPGA models, a-Ram instructions are bit level and execute in
situ. They support sequential and parallel languages without the space/time
overheads associated with the Turing Machine and l-calculus, enabling massive
programs to be simulated. The devices of one a-Ram model, called the Synchronic
A-Ram, are fully connected and simpler than FPGA LUT's. A compiler for an
interlanguage called Space, has been developed for the Synchronic A-Ram. Space
is MIMD. strictly typed, and deterministic. Barring memory allocation and
compilation, modules are referentially transparent. At a high level of
abstraction, modules exhibit a state transition system, aiding verification.
Data structures and parallel iteration are straightforward to implement, and
allocations of sub-processes and data transfers to resources are implicit.
Space points towards highly connected architectures called Synchronic Engines,
that scale in a GALS manner. Synchronic Engines are more general purpose than
systolic arrays and GPUs, and bypass programmability and conflict issues
associated with multicores.

structure in La(2-x)Ba(x)CuO(4) single crystals have been studied by means of
x-ray and neutron diffraction as well as static magnetization measurements. The
derived phase diagram shows that charge stripe order (CO) coexists with bulk
superconductivity in a broad range of doping around x=1/8, although the CO
order parameter falls off quickly for x<>1/8. Except for x=0.155, the onset of
CO always coincides with the transition between the orthorhombic and the
tetragonal low temperature structures. The CO transition evolves from a sharp
drop at low x to a more gradual transition at higher x, eventually falling
below the structural phase boundary for optimum doping. With respect to the
interlayer CO correlations, we find no qualitative change of the stripe
stacking order as a function of doping, and in-plane and out-of-plane
correlations disappear simultaneously at the transition. Similarly to the CO,
the spin stripe order (SO) is also most pronounced at x=1/8. Truly static SO
sets in below the CO and coincides with the first appearance of in-plane
superconducting correlations at temperatures significantly above the bulk
transition to superconductivity (SC). Indications that bulk SC causes a
reduction of the spin or charge stripe order could not be identified. We argue
that CO is the dominant order that is compatible with SC pairing but competes
with SC phase coherence. Comparing our results with data from the literature,
we find good agreement if all results are plotted as a function of x' instead
of the nominal x, where x' represents an estimate of the actual Ba content,
extracted from the doping dependence of the structural transition between the
orthorhombic phase and the tetragonal high-temperature phase.

computational cost formally scales as g(D,\xi /N)D^3, where g(D,\xi /N) is a
nontrivial function. For \xi << N, this scaling reduces to D^3, independent of

documents is independent, which results in learned ranking functions that
return redundant results. The few approaches that avoid this have rather
unsatisfyingly lacked theoretical foundations, or do not scale. We present a
learning-to-rank formulation that optimizes the fraction of satisfied users,
with several scalable algorithms that explicitly takes document similarity and
ranking context into account. Our formulation is a non-trivial common
generalization of two multi-armed bandit models from the literature: ""ranked
bandits"" (Radlinski et al., ICML 2008) and ""Lipschitz bandits"" (Kleinberg et
al., STOC 2008). We present theoretical justifications for this approach, as
well as a near-optimal algorithm. Our evaluation adds optimizations that
improve empirical performance, and shows that our algorithms learn orders of
magnitude more quickly than previous approaches.

high optical depth will rely on both hardware and software solutions, we
compare a direct inverse ray-shooting code implemented on a graphics processing
unit (GPU) with both a widely-used hierarchical tree code on a single-core CPU,
and a recent implementation of a parallel tree code suitable for a CPU-based
cluster supercomputer. We examine the accuracy of the tree codes through
comparison with a direct code over a much wider range of parameter space than
has been feasible before. We demonstrate that all three codes present
comparable accuracy, and choice of approach depends on considerations relating
to the scale and nature of the microlensing problem under investigation. On
current hardware, there is little difference in the processing speed of the
single-core CPU tree code and the GPU direct code, however the recent plateau
in single-core CPU speeds means the existing tree code is no longer able to
take advantage of Moore's law-like increases in processing speed. Instead, we
anticipate a rapid increase in GPU capabilities in the next few years, which is
advantageous to the direct code. We suggest that progress in other areas of
astrophysical computation may benefit from a transition to GPUs through the use
of ""brute force"" algorithms, rather than attempting to port the current best
solution directly to a GPU language -- for certain classes of problems, the
simple implementation on GPUs may already be no worse than an optimised
single-core CPU version.

curvature of the plot SD12 vs m is much reduced for diabetic subject. The
scatter plot of two successive interbeat intervals points out smaller
variability in diabetic heart. The detrended fluctuation exponent has a higher
value for diabetic group. The auto-correlation function of the deviation of
interbeat interval in diabetic group shows highly correlated pattern when
compared to that of normal one. The study suggests that the curvature of $SD12$

observations of high-energy (HE) spectral attenuation. The recent Fermi-LAT
observations of prompt GeV emission from several bright GRBs have leaded to
conclusions of unexpectedly large LFs, $\Gamma>10^3$. Here we revisit this
problem with two main concerns. (1) With one-zone assumption where all photons
are assumed to be generated in the same region (radius) and time, we {\em
self-consistently} calculate the $\gamma\gamma$ optical depth by adopting a
target photon spectrum with HE cutoff. We find that this might be important
when the GRB LF is below a few hundreds. (2) Recent Fermi-LAT observations
suggest that the bulk MeV-range and HE ($\ga100$ MeV) emission may arise from
different regions. We then consider a two-zone case where HE emission is
generated in much larger radii than that of the MeV-range emission. We find
that the HE emission may be mainly attenuated by MeV-range emission and that
the attenuated HE spectrum does not show an exponential spectral cutoff but a
slight steepening. This suggests that there may be no abrupt cutoff due to
$\gamma\gamma$ attenuation if relaxing the one-zone assumption. By studying the
spectra of three bright Fermi-LAT GRBs 080916C, 090510 and 090902B, we show
that a bulk LF of\textbf{ $\Gamma\sim600$ }can be consistent with observations
in the two-zone case. Even lower LFs can be obtained in the multi-zone case.

flaring, with some flares reaching fluxes of more than 3.0 Crab between 20-60
keV for several 100 seconds, while the average flux is around 250 mCrab. We
analyzed all archival INTEGRAL data, calculating the brightness distribution in
the 20-60 keV band, which, as we show, closely follows a log-normal
distribution. Orbital resolved analysis shows that the structure is strongly
variable, explainable by shocks and a fluctuating accretion wake. Analysis of
RXTE ASM data suggests a strong orbital change of N_H. Accreted clump masses
derived from the INTEGRAL data are on the order of 5 x 10^19 -10^21 g. We show
that the lightcurve can be described with a model of multiplicative random
numbers. In the course of the simulation we calculate the power spectral
density of the system in the 20-100 keV energy band and show that it follows a
red-noise power law. We suggest that a mixture of a clumpy wind, shocks, and
turbulence can explain the measured mass distribution. As the recently

flare (M8.9/3B) event that occurred on 4 June 2007 from NOAA AR 10960. The
flare was observed by several spaceborne instruments, namely SOHO/MDI,
Hinode/SOT, TRACE and STEREO/SECCHI. The flare was initiated near a small,
positive-polarity, satellite sunspot at the centre of the AR, surrounded by
opposite-polarity field regions. MDI images of the AR show considerable amount
of changes in a small positive-polarity sunspot of delta configuration during
the flare event. SOT/G-band (4305 A) images of the sunspot also suggest the
rapid evolution of the positive-polarity sunspot with highly twisted penumbral
filaments before the flare event, which were oriented in the counterclockwise
direction. It shows the change in orientation and also remarkable disappearance
of twisted penumbral filaments (~35-40%) and enhancement in umbral area
(~45-50%) during the decay phase of the flare. TRACE and SECCHI observations
reveal the successive activations of two helical twisted structures associated
with this sunspot, and the corresponding brightening in the chromosphere as
observed by the time-sequence images of SOT/Ca II H line (3968 A). The
secondary-helical twisted structure is found to be associated with the M8.9
flare event. The brightening starts 6-7 min prior to the flare maximum with the
appearance of secondary helical-twisted structure. The flare intensity
maximizes as this structure moves away from the AR. This twisted flux-tube
associated with the flare triggering, is found to be failed in eruption. The
location of the flare is found to coincide with the activation site of the
helical twisted structures. We conclude that the activations of successive
helical twists in the magnetic flux tubes/ropes plays a crucial role in the
energy build-up process and triggering of M-class solar flare without a CME.

for the corona having a temperature of millions of degrees. Current
observational technologies lack the resolving power to confirm the nanoflare
hypothesis. An alternative approach is to construct a magnetohydrodynamic
coronal loop model that has the ability to predict nanoflare energy
distributions.
  Aims: This paper presents the initial results generated by such a model. It
predicts heating events with a range of sizes, depending on where the
instability threshold for linear kink modes is encountered. The aims are to
calculate the distribution of event energies and to investigate whether kink
instability can be predicted from a single parameter.
  Methods: The loop is represented as a straight line-tied cylinder. The
twisting caused by random photospheric motions is captured by two parameters,
representing the ratio of current density to field strength for specific
regions of the loop. Dissipation of the loop's magnetic energy begins during
the nonlinear stage of the instability, which develops as a consequence of
current sheet reconnection. After flaring, the loop evolves to the state of
lowest energy where, in accordance with relaxation theory, the ratio of current
to field is constant throughout the loop and helicity is conserved.
  Results: The results suggest that instability cannot be predicted by any
simple twist-derived property reaching a critical value. The model is applied
such that the loop undergoes repeated episodes of instability followed by
energy-releasing relaxation. Hence, an energy distribution of the nanoflares
produced is collated.
  Conclusions: The final energy distribution features two nanoflare populations
that follow different power laws. The power law index for the higher energy
population is more than sufficient for coronal heating.

fundamental for an astronomical site for many different reasons: (1) the wind
speed shear contributes to trigger optical turbulence in the whole troposphere,
(2) a few of the astroclimatic parameters such as the wavefront coherence time
(tau_0) depends directly on V(h), (3) the equivalent velocity V_0, controlling
the frequency at which the adaptive optics systems have to run to work
properly, depends on the vertical distribution of the wind speed and optical
turbulence. Also, a too strong wind speed near the ground can introduce
vibrations in the telescope structures. The wind speed at a precise pressure
(200 hPa) has frequently been used to retrieve indications concerning the tau_0
and the frequency limits imposed to all instrumentation based on adaptive
optics systems, but more recently it has been proved that V_200 (wind speed at
200 hPa) alone is not sufficient to provide exhaustive elements concerning this
topic and that the vertical distribution of the wind speed is necessary. In
this paper a complete characterization of the vertical distribution of wind
speed strength is done above Mt.Graham (Arizona, US), site of the Large
Binocular Telescope. We provide a climatological study extended over 10 years

that the properties of PAHs have spatial variations. Emission from ionized and

TeV flares from M87 via proton-proton collisions. Since the produced radiation

attributed to the sublimation of icy mantles on dust grains initiated by the
warming effect of the stellar radiation. We have used a model of the chemistry
in warm cores in which the sublimation process is based on extensive laboratory

well-defined temperature bands. We have determined the position of these bands
for the slow warming by a solar-mass star. The resulting chemistry is dominated
by the sublimation process and by subsequent gas-phase reactions; strong
spatial and temporal variations in certain molecular species are found to
occur, and our results are, in general, consistent with observational results

which mass is accreted onto and ejected by a young star. The visible
spectrometer VEGA on the CHARA array can be an efficient means of probing the
structure and the kinematics of the hot circumstellar gas at sub-AU. For the
first time, we observed the Herbig Ae star AB Aur in the H$\alpha$ emission
line, using the VEGA low spectral resolution on two baselines of the array. We
computed and calibrated the spectral visibilities between 610 nm and 700 nm. To
simultaneously reproduce the line profile and the visibility, we used a 1-D
radiative transfer code that calculates level populations for hydrogen atoms in
a spherical geometry and synthetic spectro-interferometric observables. We
clearly resolved AB Aur in the H$\alpha$ line and in a part of the continuum,
even at the smallest baseline of 34 m. The small P-Cygni absorption feature is
indicative of an outflow but could not be explained by a spherical stellar wind
model. Instead, it favors a magneto-centrifugal X-disk or disk-wind geometry.
The fit of the spectral visibilities could not be accounted for by a wind
alone, so we considered a brightness asymmetry possibly caused by large-scale
nebulosity or by the known spiral structures, inducing a visibility modulation
around H$\alpha$. Thanks to the unique capabilities of VEGA, we managed to
simultaneously record for the first time a spectrum at a resolution of 1700 and
spectral visibilities in the visible range on a target as faint as $m_{V}$ =
7.1. It was possible to rule out a spherical geometry for the wind of AB Aur
and provide realistic solutions to account for the H$\alpha$ emission
compatible with magneto-centrifugal acceleration. The study illustrates the
advantages of optical interferometry and motivates observations of other bright
young stars to shed light on the accretion/ejection processes.

computational complexity. In particular, it has been shown that it is NP-hard
to compute how to manipulate a number of different voting rules. However,
NP-hardness only bounds the worst-case complexity. Recent theoretical results
suggest that manipulation may often be easy in practice. In this paper, we
study empirically the manipulability of single transferable voting (STV) to
determine if computational complexity is really a barrier to manipulation. STV
was one of the first voting rules shown to be NP-hard. It also appears one of
the harder voting rules to manipulate. We sample a number of distributions of

considerations about unitarity, we propose new boundary conditions for the
equations of motion of the graviton perturbations that force the amplitude of
the ghosts modes to vanish. We analyze explicitly four-derivative perturbative
corrections to Einstein gravity which generically lead to four-derivative
equations of motion, compare our choice of boundary conditions to previous
proposals and show that, with our new prescription, the ratio $\eta/s$ remains
at the Einstein-gravity value of $1/4\pi$ to leading order in the corrections.
It is argued that, when the new boundary conditions are imposed on six and
higher-derivative equations of motion, $\eta/s$ can only increase from the
Einstein-gravity value. We also recall some general arguments that support the
validity of our results to all orders in the strength of the corrections to
Einstein gravity. We then discuss the particular case of Gauss-Bonnet gravity,
for which the equations of motion are only of two-derivative order and the
value of $\eta/s$ can decrease below $1/4\pi$ when treated in a nonperturbative
way. Our findings provide further evidence for the validity of the KSS bound

different gases from the surrounding ambient is here described. By selecting
different species of gases, it was possible to vary the jet-to-ambient density
ratio in the 0.04 to 12 range and observe its effect on the jet morphology. By
adjusting the stagnation and ambient pressures, it has been possible to select
the Mach number of the jets, independently from the density ratio. Each jet is
therefore characterized by its maximum Mach number, ranging from 10 to 50. The
Reynolds number range of the nozzle is 1000 to 50000. The spatial evolution of
the jets was observed over a much larger scale than the nozzle diameter. The
gas densities were evaluated from the light emission induced by an electron
beam and the gas concentrations were obtained by analyzing the color of the
emitted light. The results have shown that the morphology of the jets depends
to a greater extent on the density ratio. Jets that are lighter than the
ambient exhibit a more intense jet-ambient mixing than jets that are heavier
than the ambient, while the effects of changing the jet Mach number do not seem
to be too large in the explored range. These results can be expressed by means
of two simple scaling laws relevant to the near field (pre-Mach-disk) and the

problem governed by linear stochastic Volterra integral equation. Sufficient
and necessary condition of the existence of saddle points for this problem are
derived. As a consequence we solve the problems left by Chen and Yong in [3].
Firstly, in our framework, the term GX^2(T) is allowed to be appear in the cost
functional and the coefficients are allowed to be random. Secondly we study the
unique solvability for certain coupled forward-backward stochastic Volterra
integral equations (FBSVIEs for short) involved in this game problem. To
characterize the condition aforementioned explicitly, some other useful tools,
such as backward stochastic Fredholm-Volterra integral equations (BSFVIEs for
short) and stochastic Fredholm integral equations (FSVIEs for short) are
introduced. Some relations between them are investigated. As a application, a
linear quadratic stochastic differential game with finite delay in the state
variable and control variables is studied.

surveys of quasars. Differing approaches for fitting the Civ line can be found
in the literature, and we compare the most common methods to highlight the
relative systematics associated with each. We develop a line fitting procedure
and apply it to the Civ line in spectra from the SDSS, 2QZ and 2SLAQ surveys.
  Our results are compared with a previous study of the Mgii line in the same
sample. Civ tends to be broader than the Mgii line in spectra that have both,
and the average ratio between the lines is consistent with a simplistic model
for a photoionised, virialised and stratified broad-line region. There is a
statistically significant correlation between the widths of the Civ and Mgii
lines. However, the correlation is weak, and the scatter around a best fit is
only marginally less than the full dynamic range of line widths.
  Motivated by previous work, we examine the dispersion in the distribution of
Civ line widths. We find that the dispersion in Civ line widths is essentially
independent of both redshift and luminosity. This is in stark contrast to the
Mgii line, which shows a strong luminosity dependence.
  Finally we consider our results in terms of their implications for virial
black hole mass estimation. The inconsistency between Mgii and Civ line widths
in single spectra, combined with the differing behaviour of the Mgii and Civ
line width distributions, indicates that there must be an inconsistency between
Mgii and Civ virial mass estimators. Furthermore, the level of intrinsic
dispersion in Mgii and Civ line widths contributes less dynamic range to virial
mass estimates than the error associated with the estimates. The indication is
that the line width term in these UV virial mass estimators may be essentially
irrelevant with respect to the typical uncertainty on a mass estimate.

such a situation is an absence of detailed observational data, especially, of
high-resolution kinematics. In this Letter we study the stellar kinematics of
the inner part (r < 15 kpc) of Malin 1. We present spectroscopic arguments in
favour of a small galaxy - Malin 1B - being a companion probably interacting
with the main galaxy - Malin 1. This object is clearly seen in many published
images of Malin 1 but is not mentioned in any astronomical databases. Malin 1B
is located at the projected distance of 14 kpc from the Malin 1's nucleus and
has small - 65$\pm$16 km/s - relative velocity, which we determined for the
first time. We suggest that ongoing interaction with Malin 1B can explain main
morphological features of the Malin 1's central region - two-armed spiral
structure, a bar, and an external one-armed spiral pattern. We also
investigated the large scale environment of Malin 1 and postulate that the
galaxy SDSS J123708.91+142253.2 might be responsible for the formation of
extended low-surface brightness envelope by means of head-on collision with

systems will have circularized before entering the LISA bandwidth. Current
astrophysical simulations now suggest that systems could have a non-negligible
eccentricity in the LISA band, and an important level of eccentricity in the
Pulsar Timing regime. In this work, we use a set of source catalogues from
astrophysically motivated models of massive black hole binary formation and
assume a one year LISA mission lifetime. Depending on the model in question,
the initial eccentricities in the final year of the inspiral can be as high as
0.6 for high mass seeds and 0.8 for low mass seeds. We show that restricted
post-Newtonian circular templates are extremely inefficient in recovering
eccentric binaries, with median optimal signal to noise ratio recoveries of
approximately 10% for all models considered. This coupled with extremely large
errors in parameter recovery from individual Markov chain Monte Carlo's
demonstrate quite clearly that even to search for binaries with initial
eccentricities as low as $10^{-4}$, we will require eccentric templates for

integral is given in terms of a classical collision operator defined in the
phase space. To find an algorithm to compute the collision bracket integrals,
we revisit the eigenvalue problem of the Liouville operator and re-examine the
method previously reported[Chem. Phys. 20, 93(1977)]. Then we apply the notion
and concept of the eigenfunctions of the Liouville operator and knowledge
acquired in the study of the eigenfunctions to obtain alternative forms for
collision integrals. One of the alternative forms is given in the form of time
correlation function. This form, on an additional approximation, assumes a form
reminiscent of the Chapman-Enskog collision bracket integral for dilute gases.
It indeed gives rise to the latter in the case of two particles. The
alternative forms obtained are more readily amenable to numerical simulation
methods than the collision bracket integras expressed in terms of a classical
collision operator, which requires solution of classical Lippmann-Schwinger
integral equations. This way, the aforementioned kinetic theory of dense fluids
is made more accessible by numerical computation/simulation methods than
before.

maintain an efficient transport system. As osmotically driven water uptake is
often distal from the tips, and aqueous fluids are incompressible, we propose
that growth induces mass flows across the mycelium, whether or not there are
intrahyphal concentration gradients. We imaged the temporal evolution of
networks formed by Phanerochaete velutina, and at each stage calculated the
unique set of currents that account for the observed changes in cord volume,
while minimising the work required to overcome viscous drag. Predicted speeds
were in reasonable agreement with experimental data, and the pressure gradients
needed to produce these flows are small. Furthermore, cords that were predicted
to carry fast-moving or large currents were significantly more likely to
increase in size than cords with slow-moving or small currents. The
incompressibility of the fluids within fungi means there is a rapid global
response to local fluid movements. Hence velocity of fluid flow is a local
signal that conveys quasi-global information about the role of a cord within
the mycelium. We suggest that fluid incompressibility and the coupling of
growth and mass flow are critical physical features that enable the development
of efficient, adaptive, biological transport networks.

amongst physicists as it was believed to be a signature of pairing, in some
cases well above the room temperature. In this ""pre-formed pairs"" scenario, the
formation of pairs without quantum phase rigidity occurs below T*. These pairs
condense and develop phase coherence only below Tc. In contrast, several recent
experiments reported that the pseudogap and superconducting states are
characterized by two different energy scales, pointing to a scenario, where the
two compete. However a number of transport, magnetic, thermodynamic and
tunneling spectroscopy experiments consistently detect a signature of
phase-fluctuating superconductivity above leaving open the question of whether
the pseudogap is caused by pair formation or not. Here we report the discovery
of a spectroscopic signature of pair formation and demonstrate that in a region
of the phase diagram commonly referred to as the ""pseudogap"", two distinct
states coexist: one that persists to an intermediate temperature Tpair and a
second that extends up to T*. The first state is characterized by a doping
independent scaling behavior and is due to pairing above Tc, but significantly
below T*. The second state is the ""proper"" pseudogap - characterized by a
""checker board"" pattern in STM images, the absence of pair formation, and is
likely linked to Mott physics of pristine CuO2 planes. Tpair has a universal
value around 130-150K even for materials with very different Tc, likely setting
limit on highest, attainable Tc in cuprates. The observed universal scaling
behavior with respect to Tpair indicates a breakdown of the classical picture
of phase fluctuations in the cuprates.

particle hydrodynamics (SPH) scheme coupled with accelerated radiative
transfer. The basic idea for the acceleration of radiative transfer is parallel
to the tree algorithm that is hitherto used to speed up the gravitational force
calculation in an N-body system. It is demonstrated that the radiative transfer
calculations can be dramatically accelerated, where the computational time is
scaled as Np log Ns for Np SPH particles and Ns radiation sources. Such
acceleration allows us to readily include not only numerous sources but also
scattering photons, even if the total number of radiation sources is comparable
to that of SPH particles. Here, a test simulation is presented for a multiple
source problem, where the results with START are compared to those with a
radiation SPH code without tree-based acceleration. We find that the results
agree well with each other if we set the tolerance parameter as < 1.0, and then
it demonstrates that START can solve radiative transfer faster without reducing
the accuracy. One of important applications with START is to solve the transfer
of diffuse ionizing photons, where each SPH particle is regarded as an emitter.
To illustrate the competence of START, we simulate the shadowing effect by
dense clumps around an ionizing source. As a result, it is found that the
erosion of shadows by diffuse recombination photons can be solved. Such an
effect is of great significance to reveal the cosmic reionization process.

each infinite branch of it yields an accumulation point and vice versa.

necessarily fast). We show that BW_weak is instance-wise equivalent to the

of the computational and logical strength of BW_weak. Especially we show that
BW_weak does not solve the halting problem and does not lead to more than
primitive recursive growth. Therefore it is strictly weaker than BW. We also
discuss possible uses of BW_weak.

strength of the surface magnetic field at the polar caps. We carried out
simulations of synthetic solar cycles with a flux transport model, which
follows the cyclic evolution of the surface field determined by flux emergence
and advective transport by near-surface flows. In each hemisphere, an
axisymmetric band of latitudinal flows converging towards the central latitude
of the activity belt was superposed onto the background poleward meridional
flow. The overall effect of the flow perturbation is to reduce the latitude
separation of the magnetic polarities of a bipolar magnetic region and thus
diminish its contribution to the polar field. As a result, the polar field
maximum reached around cycle activity minimum is weakened by the presence of
the meridional flow perturbation. For a flow perturbation consistent with
helioseismic observations, the polar field is reduced by about 18% compared to
the case without inflows. If the amplitude of the flow perturbation depends on
the cycle strength, its effect on the polar field provides a nonlinearity that
could contribute to limiting the amplitude of a Babcock-Leighton type dynamo.

the first comprehensive study of the statistical properties of X-ray flickering

analyzed a sample of 97 X-ray light curves of 75 objects of all classes
observed with the XMM-Newton space telescope. By using the wavelets analysis,
each light curve has been characterized by two parameters, alpha and Sigma,
that describe the energy distribution of flickering on different timescales and
the strength at a given timescale, respectively. We also used the R/S analysis
to determine the Hurst exponent of each light curve and define their degree of
stochastic memory in time. The X-ray flickering is typically composed of long
time scale events (1.5 < alpha < 3), with very similar strengths in all the
subtypes of cataclysmic variables (-3 < Sigma < -1.5). The X-ray data are
distributed in a much smaller area of the alpha-Sigma parameter space with
respect to those obtained with optical light curves. The tendency of the
optical flickering in magnetic systems to show higher Sigma values than the
non-magnetic systems is not encountered in the X-rays. The Hurst exponents
estimated for all light curves of the sample are larger than those found in the
visible, with a peak at 0.82. In particular, we do not obtain values lower than
0.5. The X-ray flickering presents a persistent memory in time, which seems to
be stronger in objects containing magnetic white dwarf primaries. The
similarity of the X-ray flickering in objects of different classes together
with the predominance of a persistent stochastic behavior can be explained it
terms of magnetically-driven accretion processes acting in a considerable
fraction of the analyzed objects.

viscous damping of the helical magnetic field in the radiation era after

weak to provide the seeds for the observed fields in galaxies and clusters.

the dark matter of the Universe. The stability of dark matter and the smallness
of neutrino masses are guaranteed by a U(1) global symmetry, broken to a

emerge at the loop level being further suppressed by the small explicit
breaking of the U(1) symmetry. The new particles and interactions are invoked

spectroscopy of both the NGC 1333 & Serpens North clusters to perform a
detailed study of the X-ray properties of two of the nearest embedded clusters
to the Sun. In NGC 1333, a total of 95 cluster members are detected in X-rays,
of which 54 were previously identified with Spitzer. Of the Spitzer sources, we
detect 23% of the Class I protostars, 53% of the Flat Spectrum sources, 52% of
the Class II, and 50% of the Transition Disk YSOs. Forty-one Class III members
of the cluster are identified, bringing the total identified YSO population to
178. The X-ray Luminosity Functions (XLFs) of the NGC 1333 and Serpens clusters
are compared to each other and the Orion Nebula Cluster. Based on this
comparison, we obtain a new distance for the Serpens cluster of 360+22/-13 pc.
The X-ray luminosity was found to depend on the bolometric luminosity as in
previous studies of other clusters, and that Lx depends primarily on the
stellar surface area. In the NGC 1333 cluster, the Class III sources have a
somewhat higher X-ray luminosity for a given surface area. We also find
evidence in NGC 1333 for a jump in the X-ray luminosity between spectral types
of M0 and K7, we speculate that this may result from the presence of radiative
zones in the K-stars. The gas column density vs. extinction in the NGC 1333 was
found to be N_H = 0.89 +/- 0.13 x 10^22 A_K, this is lower than expected of the
standard ISM but similar to that found previously in the Serpens Cloud Core.

systematically study the role of momentum dependent interactions in global
stopping and analyze the effect of symmetry energy in the presence of momentum
dependent interactions. For this, we simulate the reactions by varying the
total mass of the system from 80 to 394 at different beam energies from 30 to
1000 MeV/nucleon over central and semi-central geometries. The study is carried
in the presence of momentum dependent interactions and symmetry energy by
taking into account hard equation of state. The nuclear stopping is found to be
sensitive towards the momentum dependent interactions and symmetry energy at
low incident energies. The momentum dependent interactions are found to weaken
the finite size effects in nuclear stopping.

generate unique properties: the ability to influence the 3-dimensional
structure of the film, the presence of a surface, and the generation of an
interface. In all three cases, a clear understanding of the resulting atomic
structure is desirable. However, determining the full structure of an epitaxial
thin film (lattice parameters, space group, atomic positions, surface
reconstructions) on a routine basis is a serious challenge. In this paper we
highlight the remarkable information that can be extracted from both the Bragg
scattering and inelastic multiple scattering events that occur during
Reflection High Energy Electron Diffraction. We review some methods to extract
structural information and show how mature techniques used in other fields can
be directly applied to the {\em in-situ} and real-time diffraction images of a
growing film. These collection of techniques give access to both the
epitaxially influenced 3 dimensional bulk structure of the film, and any
reconstructions that may happen at the surface.

re-analyzed in a search for in-medium modifications. The data were taken with
the Crystal Barrel(CB)/TAPS detector system at the ELSA accelerator facility in
Bonn. First results from the analysis of the data set were published by D.
Trnka et al. in Phys. Rev. Lett 94 (2005) 192303 \cite{david}, claiming a
lowering of the $\omega$ mass in the nuclear medium by 14$%$ at normal nuclear
matter density. The extracted $\omega$ line shape was found to be sensitive to
the background subtraction. For this reason a re-analysis of the same data set
has been initiated and a new method has been developed to reduce the background
and to determine the shape and absolute magnitude of the background directly
from the data. Details of the re-analysis and of the background determination
are described. The $\omega$ signal on the $Nb$ target, extracted in the
re-analysis, does not show a deviation from the corresponding line shape on a
$LH_2$ target, measured as reference. The earlier claim of an in-medium mass
shift is thus not confirmed. The sensitivity of the $\omega$ line shape to
different in-medium modification scenarios is discussed.
