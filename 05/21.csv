detectors. With the interferometer locked in a single-arm configuration, we
modulate the frequency of the laser light, creating an effective length
variation that we calibrate by measuring the amplitude of the frequency
modulation. By simultaneously driving the voice coil actuators that control the
length of the arm cavity, we calibrate the voice coil actuation coefficient
with an estimated 1-sigma uncertainty of less than one percent. This technique
enables a force-free, single-step actuator calibration using a displacement
fiducial that is fundamentally different from those employed in other
calibration methods.

short-time variability. We show that the time variability may be explained in
the context of a self-consistent synchrotron-self Compton model, while the long
time observation do not necessarily require a time-resolved treatment. The
kinetic equations for electrons and photons in a plasma blob are solved
numerically including Fermi acceleration for electrons as well as synchrotron
radiation and Compton scattering. The light curve observed by VERITAS can be
reproduced in our model by assuming a changing level of electron injection
compared to the constant state of 1ES1218+30.4. The multiwavelength behaviour
during an outburst becomes comprehensible by the model. The long time
measurements of VERITAS are still explainable via a constant emission in the
SSC context, but the short outbursts each require a time-resolved treatment.

The existence of such an n for any k is due to van der Waerden but known upper
bounds on W(k,2) are enormous. Much effort was put into developing lower bounds
on W(k,2). Most of these lower bound proofs employ the probabilistic method
often in combination with the Lov\'asz Local Lemma. While these proofs show the
existence of a 2-coloring that has no monochromatic arithmetic progression of
length k they provide no efficient algorithm to find such a coloring. These
kind of proofs are often informally called nonconstructive in contrast to
constructive proofs that provide an efficient algorithm.
  This paper clarifies these notions and gives definitions for deterministic-
and randomized-constructive proofs as different types of constructive proofs.
We then survey the literature on lower bounds on W(k,2) in this light. We show
how known nonconstructive lower bound proofs based on the Lov\'asz Local Lemma
can be made randomized-constructive using the recent algorithms of Moser and
Tardos. We also use a derandomization of Chandrasekaran, Goyal and Haeupler to
transform these proofs into deterministic-constructive proofs. We provide
greatly simplified and fully self-contained proofs and descriptions for these

near-UV OH lines, can provide invaluable information on the properties of the
Early Galaxy. Near-UV OH lines constitute an important tool to derive oxygen
abundances in metal-poor dwarf stars. Therefore, it is important to correctly
model the line formation of OH lines, especially in metal-poor stars, where 3D
hydrodynamical models commonly predict cooler temperatures than plane-parallel
hydrostatic models in the upper photosphere. We have made use of a grid of 52
3D hydrodynamical model atmospheres for dwarf stars computed using the code
CO5BOLD, extracted from the more extended CIFIST grid. The 52 models cover the
effective temperature range 5000-6500K, the surface gravity range 3.5-4.5 and
the metallicity range -3<[Fe/H]<0. We determine 3D-LTE abundance corrections in
all the 52 3D models for several OH lines and FeI lines of different excitation
potentials. These 3D-LTE corrections are generally negative reaching values of
roughly -1 dex (for the OH 3167 with excitation potential of approximately 1
eV) for the higher temperatures and surface gravities. We apply these 3D-LTE
corrections to the individual O abundances, derived from OH lines, of a sample
the metal-poor dwarf stars reported in Israelian et al.(1998, 2001) and
Boesgaard et al.(1999), by interpolating the stellar parameters of the dwarfs
in the grid of 3D-LTE corrections. The new 3D-LTE [O/Fe] ratio still keeps a
similar trend as the 1D-LTE, i.e, increasing towards lower [Fe/H] values. We
applied 1D-NLTE corrections to 3D FeI abundances and we still see an increasing
[O/Fe] ratio towards lower metallicites. However, the Galactic [O/Fe] ratio
must be revisited once 3D-NLTE corrections become available for OH and Fe lines
for a grid of 3D hydrodynamical model atmospheres.

Timing mode with XMM-Newton publicly available until September 30, 2009. We
performed a detailed data analysis considering pile-up and background effects.
The properties of the iron lines differed from previous published analyses due
to either incorrect pile-up corrections or different continuum
parameterization. 80% of the observations for which a spectrum can be extracted
showed significant Fe line emission. We found an average line centroid of 6.67
$\pm$ 0.02 keV and a finite width, $\sigma$, of 0.33 $\pm$ 0.02 keV. The
equivalent width of the lines varied between 17 and 189 eV, with an average
weighted value of 42 $\pm$ eV. For sources where several observations were
available the Fe line parameters changed between observations whenever the
continuum changed significantly. The line parameters did not show any
correlation with luminosity. Most important, we could fit the Fe line with a
simple Gaussian component for all the sources. The lines did not show the
asymmetric profiles that were interpreted as an indication of relativistic
effects in previous analyses of these LMXBs.

For any generic network ensemble, if synchronization speed is at all extremal
at intermediate randomness, it is slowest in the small world regime. This
phenomenon occurs for various types of oscillators, intrinsic dynamics and

J. Phys. 12, 055007 (2010) when a critical front propagates much faster than
the maximal group velocity of quasiparticles vq, then the transition is
effectively homogeneous: density of excitations obeys a generalized
Kibble-Zurek mechanism and scales with the sixth root of the transition rate.
However, unlike for z = 1, the inhomogeneous transition becomes adiabatic not
below vq but a lower threshold velocity v', proportional to inhomogeneity of
the transition, where the excitations are suppressed exponentially.
Interestingly, the adiabatic threshold v' is nonzero despite vanishing minimal
group velocity of low energy quasiparticles. In the adiabatic regime below v'
the inhomogeneous transition can be used for efficient adiabatic quantum state
preparation in a quantum simulator: the time required for the critical front to
sweep across a chain of N spins adiabatically is merely linear in N, while the
corresponding time for a homogeneous transition across the multicritical point
scales with the sixth power of N. What is more, excitations after the adiabatic
inhomogeneous transition, if any, are brushed away by the critical front to the
end of the spin chain.

an almost sure $L^2$ condition on the drift/diffusion ratio. This is a
considerably weaker condition than the usual Novikov one, and it allows us to
prove uniqueness in law for the Allen-Cahn SPDE driven by space-time white

recently. The main hypothesis of this new interpretation is that quantum
particles are entities interacting with matter conceptually, which means that
pieces of matter function as interfaces for the conceptual content carried by
the quantum particles. We explain how our interpretation was inspired by our
earlier analysis of non-locality as non-spatiality and a specific
interpretation of quantum potentiality, which we illustrate by means of the
example of two interconnected vessels of water. We show by means of this
example that philosophical realism is not in contradiction with the recent
findings with respect to Leggett's inequalities and their violations. We
explain our recent work on using the quantum formalism to model human concepts
and their combinations and how this has given rise to the foundational ideas of
our new quantum interpretation. We analyze the equivalence of meaning in the
realm of human concepts and coherence in the realm of quantum particles, and
how the duality of abstract and concrete leads naturally to a Heisenberg
uncertainty relation. We illustrate the role played by interference and
entanglement and show how the new interpretation explains the problems related
to identity and individuality in quantum mechanics. We put forward a possible
scenario for the emergence of the reality of macroscopic objects.

the PIN protein are the key regulator for the spatial and temporal organization
of plant development. In particular auxin induces the polar localization of its
own efflux facilitator. Due to this positive feedback auxin flow is directed
and patterns of auxin and PIN arise. During the earliest stage of vein
initiation in leaves auxin accumulates in a single cell in a rim of epidermal
cells from which it flows into the ground meristem tissue of the leaf blade.
There the localized auxin supply yields the successive polarization of PIN
distribution along a strand of cells. We model the auxin and PIN dynamics
within cells with a minimal canalization model. Solving the model analytically
we uncover an excitable polarization front that triggers a polar distribution
of PIN proteins in cells. As polarization fronts may extend to opposing
directions from their initiation site we suggest a possible resolution to the
puzzling occurrence of bipolar cells, such we offer an explanation for the
development of closed, looped veins. Employing non-linear analysis we identify
the role of the contributing microscopic processes during polarization.
Furthermore, we deduce quantitative predictions on polarization fronts
establishing a route to determine the up to now largely unknown kinetic rates
of auxin and PIN dynamics.

significantly from a pure power-law, curving downwards at low and upwards at

well-described by a single power law. Since major dry mergers change neither
the colors nor sigma, but they do change masses and sizes, the clear features
observed in the scaling relations with M*, but not with sigma > 150 km/s,
suggest that M* > 2x10^11 Msun is the scale above which major dry mergers

minor dry mergers, as suggested by the axis ratio and color gradient trends. In
another, although both major and minor mergers occur at the high mass end, the
minor mergers contribute primarily to the formation of the ICL, rather than to

simulations to better understand important real-world phenomena. While there
has been a great deal of work on simulation tools from the high-performance
computing community, behavioral simulations remain challenging to program and
automatically scale in parallel environments. In this paper we present BRACE
(Big Red Agent-based Computation Engine), which extends the MapReduce framework
to process these simulations efficiently across a cluster. We can leverage
spatial locality to treat behavioral simulations as iterated spatial joins and
greatly reduce the communication between nodes. In our experiments we achieve
nearly linear scale-up on several realistic simulations.
  Though processing behavioral simulations in parallel as iterated spatial
joins can be very efficient, it can be much simpler for the domain scientists
to program the behavior of a single agent. Furthermore, many simulations
include a considerable amount of complex computation and message passing
between agents, which makes it important to optimize the performance of a
single node and the communication across nodes. To address both of these
challenges, BRACE includes a high-level language called BRASIL (the Big Red
Agent SImulation Language). BRASIL has object oriented features for programming
simulations, but can be compiled to a data-flow representation for automatic
parallelization and optimization. We show that by using various optimization
techniques, we can achieve both scalability and single-node performance similar

demonstrate how variations in the thermocapillary stress along the nanofilm

matter how small the initial transverse thermal gradient. The linear stability
analysis of the interface evolution equation explores an extreme limit of
B\'{e}nard-Marangoni flow peculiar to films of nanoscale dimensions in which
hydrostatic forces are altogether absent and deformation amplitudes are small
in comparison to the pillar spacing. Finite element simulations of the full
nonlinear equation are also used to examine the array pitch and growth rates
beyond the linear regime. Inspection of the Lyapunov free energy as a function
of time confirms that in contrast to typical cellular instabilities in
macroscopically thick films, pillar-like elongations are energetically
preferred in nanofilms. Provided there occurs no dewetting during film
deformation, it is shown that fluid elongations continue to grow until contact
with the cooler substrate is achieved. Identification of the mechanism
responsible for this phenomenon may facilitate fabrication of extended arrays

  Resolution effects are observed on integral-scale quantities such as the mean

distributions, it is found that the finest resolution is essential for
correctly computing small-scale statistics in the near-wall region of the

will not resolve the information loss paradox. (ii) The first quantum
correction give a temperature for the radiation which goes to zero as the mass
of the black hole goes to zero. Including higher order corrections changes this
nice result of the first order corrections. (iii) Finally we show that by
taking both quantum corrections and back reaction into account it is possible
under specific conditions to solve the information paradox by having the black

by an irreducible unitary representation of $\mathbb{G}$). Schroedinger
representation of this quantum Yang-Mills-Weyl theory is based on a
sesqui-holomorphic operator calculus of infinite-dimensional operators with
variational derivatives.
  The spectrum of the quantum YMWD, with initial data in the central euclidean
ball of a radius $0<R<+\infty$, is self-similar in the inverse proportion to
$R$. The spectrum is a sequence of eigenvalues convergent to $+\infty$. The
eigenvalues have finite multiplicities with respect to a von Neumann algebra
with a regular trace.
  The same holds for the quantum self-interaction of vector Yang-Mills bosons
(Theorem 4.1). Furthermore, the fundamental vacuum eigenvalue is a simple zero
(Appendix A). Presumably, this is a solution of the existence problem for a
quantum Yang-Mills theory that implies a positive spectral mass gap.
  The rigorous mathematical theory is non-perturbative with a running coupling
constant as the only ad hoc parameter. The application of the first
mathematical principles depends essentially on the properties of the compact

flat vector bundle over phase space, using the connection of Fedosov's
construction of deformation quantization. This generalizes the ordinary
Schr\""odinger representation, and allows naturally for a description of quantum
states in terms of a curve plus a wave function. Hamilton's equation arises in
this context as a condition on the curve, ensuring the dynamics to split into a
classical and a quantum part.

sufficiently culminated beams, all long wave-length modes are shown to be
Weibel-unstable, and a simple analytic expression for their growth rate is
derived. For large transverse velocity spreads, these modes become stable. An
analytic condition for stability is given. These analytic results, which
generalize earlier ones given in the literature, are shown to be in agreement
with numerical solutions of the dispersion equation and with the results of
novel PIC simulations in which the electro-magnetic fields are restricted to a
given k-mode. The results may describe the interaction of energetic cosmic
rays, propagating into the far upstream of a relativistic collisionless shock,
with a cold unmagnetized upstream. The long wavelength modes considered may be
efficient in deflecting particles and could be important for diffusive shock
acceleration. It is shown that while these modes grow in relativistic shocks
propagating into electron-positron pair plasmas, they are damped in
relativistic shocks propagating into electron-proton plasmas with moderate
Lorenz factors \Gamma_{sh}\lesssim 100. If these modes dominate the deflection
of energetic cosmic rays in electron-positron shocks, it is argued that

poorly understood class of chemically peculiar stars, which have traditionally
been thought not to possess significant magnetic fields. However, the recent
discovery of line profile variability in some HgMn stars, apparently
attributable to surface abundance patches, has brought this belief into
question. In this paper we investigate the chemical abundances, line profile
variability, and magnetic field of the primary and secondary of the AR Aur

find the primary is indeed a HgMn star, and present the most precise abundances
yet determined for this star. We find the secondary is a weak Am star, and is
possibly still on the pre-main sequence. Line profile variability was observed
in a range of lines in the primary, and is attributed to inhomogeneous surface
distributions of some elements. No magnetic field was detected in any
observation of either stars, with an upper limit on the longitudinal magnetic
field in both stars of 100 G. Modeling of the phase-resolve longitudinal field
measurements leads to a 3 sigma upper limit on any dipole surface magnetic

particles with nucleons. The same interaction can lead to dark matter pair

radiation this may lead to mono-jet signals. Mono-jet searches at the Tevatron
can thus place limits on DM direct detection rates. We study these bounds both
in the case where there is a contact interaction between DM and the standard

We find that in many cases the Tevatron provides the current best limit,
particularly for light dark matter, below 5 GeV, and for spin dependent
interactions. Non-standard dark matter candidates are also constrained. The
introduction of a light mediator significantly weakens the collider bound. A
direct detection discovery that is in apparent conflict with mono-jet limits
will thus point to a new light state coupling the standard model to the dark

multi-dimensional spacial variable. We focus here on one-spacial-dimensional
reaction-diffusion SPDEs; and we prove the existence of a SDDEs limit solution
to these equations under less-than-Lipschitz conditions on the drift and the
diffusion coefficients, thus extending our earlier SDDEs work to the nonzero
drift case. The regularity of this solution is obtained as a by-product of the
existence estimates. The uniqueness in law of our SPDEs follows, for a large
class of such drifts/diffusions, as a simple extension of our recent Allen-Cahn
uniqueness result. We also examine briefly, through order parameters
$\epsilon_1$ and $\epsilon_2$ multiplied by the Laplacian and the noise, the
effect of letting $\epsilon_1,\epsilon_2\to 0$ at different speeds. More
precisely, it is shown that the ratio $\epsilon_2/\epsilon_1^{1/4}$ determines
the behavior as $\epsilon_1,\epsilon_2\to 0$.

At projected radii beyond ~30 kpc, where large coherent stellar streams are

the probability that it could be due to the chance alignment of globular

present the first measurements of difference PDFs in simulations of

astrophysics. We discuss the additional information that the difference PDF can
provide on top of the power spectrum and the one-point PDF.

K-band and bolometric infrared luminosities of these galaxies both fade by a
factor of ~2 from clustercentric radii of 2r_200 to ~0.5r_200, indicating that
as galaxies enter the clusters ongoing star-formation stops first in the most
massive galaxies, and that the specific star-formation rate (SSFR) is
conserved. On smaller scales the average SSFR jumps by 25%, suggesting that in
cluster cores processes including ram pressure stripping may trigger a final
episode of star-formation that presumably exhausts the remaining gas. This
picture is consistent with our comparison of the Herschel-detected cluster
members with the cluster mass distributions, as measured in our previous
weak-lensing study of these clusters. For example, the spatial distribution of
the Herschel sources is positively correlated with the structures in the
weak-lensing mass maps at 5sigma significance, with the strongest signal seen
at intermediate group-like densities. The strong dependence of the total
cluster IR luminosity on cluster mass L_TIR propto M_virial^2 is also
consistent with accretion of galaxies and groups of galaxies (i.e. the
substructure mass function) driving the cluster IR luminosity. The most
surprising result is that roughly half of the Herschel-detected cluster members
have redder S_100/S_24 flux ratios than expected, based on the Rieke et al.
models. On average cluster members are redder than non-members, and the
fraction of red galaxies increases towards the cluster centers, both of which
indicate that these colors are not attributable to systematic photometric

Spitzer-selected luminous infrared galaxy (LIRG), is confirmed via polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) features using the Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph
(IRS) and resolved with HST WFC3 imaging. In this galaxy, which with a stellar
mass of M*=4e9 Msun is one of the two least massive ones studied with IRS at
z>2, we also detect H_2 S(4) and H_2 S(5) pure rotational lines (at 3.1 sigma
and 2.1 sigma) - the first detection of these molecular hydrogen lines in a
high-redshift galaxy. From the molecular hydrogen lines we infer an excitation
temperature T=377+68-84 K. The detection of these lines indicates that the warm
molecular gas mass is 6(+36-4)% of the stellar mass and implies the likely
existence of a substantial reservoir of cold molecular gas in the galaxy.
Future spectral observations at longer wavelengths with facilities like the
Herschel Space Observatory, the Large Millimeter Telescope, and the Atacama
Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) thus hold the promise of precisely determining the
total molecular gas mass. Given the redshift, and using refined astrometric
positions from the high resolution imaging, we also update the magnification
estimate and derived fundamental physical properties of this system. The
previously published values for total infrared luminosity, star formation rate,
and dust temperature are confirmed modulo the revised magnification; however we
find that PAH emission is roughly a factor of five stronger than would be
predicted by the relations between the total infrared and PAH luminosity
reported for SMGs and starbursts in Pope et al. (2008).

This distortion is a decrement in the CMB intensity for lambda > 1.3 mm, an

the Herschel Lensing Survey (HLS) we have mapped 1E0657-56 (the Bullet cluster)

I_{0} = 0.268 +- 0.031 MJy sr^{-1} at 500 um, consistent with the SZ effect

preferred by the SPIRE data at a significance of 2.1 sigma, opening the

establish the stellar content of Orion's individual OB associations. From this,
our new population synthesis code is utilized to derive the history of the
emission of UV radiation and kinetic energy of the material ejected by the
massive stars, and also follow the ejection of the long-lived radioactive
isotopes 26Al and 60Fe. In order to estimate the precision of our method, we
compare and contrast three distinct representations of the massive stars. We
compare the expected outputs with observations of 26Al gamma-ray signal and the
extent of the Eridanus cavity. We find an integrated kinetic energy emitted by
the massive stars of 1.8(+1.5-0.4)times 10^52 erg. This number is consistent
with the energy thought to be required to create the Eridanus superbubble. We
also find good agreement between our model and the observed 26Al signal,
estimating a mass of 5.8(+2.7-2.5) times 10^-4 Msol of 26Al in the Orion
region. Our population synthesis approach is demonstrated for the Orion region
to reproduce three different kinds of observable outputs from massive stars in
a consistent manner: Kinetic energy as manifested in ISM excavation, ionization
as manifested in free-free emission, and nucleosynthesis ejecta as manifested
in radioactivity gamma-rays. The good match between our model and the
observables does not argue for considerable modifications of mass loss. If
clumping effects turn out to be strong, other processes would need to be
identified to compensate for their impact on massive-star outputs. Our
population synthesis analysis jointly treats kinematic output and the return of
radioactive isotopes, which proves a powerful extension of the methodology that
constrains feedback from massive stars.

we derive accurate stellar parameters from optical spectra and UV to mm

Deep Field South (ECDF-S) X-ray data, and has been spectroscopically confirmed
as a z = 4.48 quasar with $L_X = 4.2\times 10^{44}$ erg/s. The single detection
gives a Lyman-alpha quasar density consistent with the X-ray luminosity
function of quasars. The coadded counts of 22 Lyman-alpha emitters (LAEs) in
the central Chandra Deep Field South (CDF-S) region yields a S/N=2.4 (p=99.83%)
detection at soft band, with an effective exposure time of ~36 Ms. Further
analysis of the equivalent width (EW) distribution shows that all the signal
comes from 12 LAE candidates with EW_rest < 400 \AA, and 2 of them contribute
about half of the signal. Following-up spectroscopic observations show that the
two are a low-redshift emission line galaxy and a Lyman break galaxy at z =
4.4. Excluding these two and combined with ECDF-S data, we derive a 3-sigma
upper limit on the average luminosity of $L_{0.5-2 keV}$ $<$ 2.4 $\times
10^{42}$ ergs/s for z ~ 4.5 LAEs. If the average X-ray emission is due to star
formation, it corresponds to a star-formation rate (SFR) of < 180--530 M$_\sun$
per yr. We use this SFR_X as an upper limit of the unobscured SFR to constrain
the escape fraction of Lyman-alpha photons, and find a lower limit of f_esc >
3-10%. However, our upper limit on the SFR_X is ~7 times larger than the upper
limit on SFR_X on z ~ 3.1 LAEs in the same field, and at least 30 times higher
than the SFR estimated from Lyman-alpha emission. From the average X-ray to
Lyman-alpha line ratio, we estimate that fewer than 3.2% (6.3%) of our LAEs

low rest frame EWs.

local universe and are thought to be powered by intense star formation. It has
been shown that in these objects the rotational spectral lines of molecular
hydrogen observed at mid-infrared wavelengths are not affected by dust
obscuration, leaving unresolved the source of excitation of this emission. Here
I report an analysis of archival Spitzer Space Telescope data on ultra-luminous
infrared galaxies and demonstrate that star formation regions are buried inside
optically thick clouds of gas and dust, so that dust obscuration affects
star-formation indicators but not molecular hydrogen. I thereby establish that
the emission of H_2 is not co-spatial with the buried starburst activity and
originates outside the obscured regions. This is rather surprising in light of
the standard view that H_2 emission is directly associated with star-formation
activity. Instead, I propose that H_2 emission in these objects traces shocks
in the surrounding material, which are in turn excited by interactions with
nearby galaxies, and that powerful large-scale shocks cooling by means of H_2
emission may be much more common than previously thought. In the early
universe, a boost in H_2 emission by this process may speed up the cooling of
matter as it collapsed to form the first stars and galaxies and would make
these first structures more readily observable.

preempt more than one 1-value packet when the buffer contains sufficiently many

37 non-AGN MIPS confirmed cluster members out to R<1.7 Mpc, and the Rieke et
al. (2009) relation to convert from 24um flux to SFR, we calculate an
integrated obscured SFR of 267 Msolar/yr and a specific star formation rate of
28 Msolar/yr per 10^14 Msolar. The cluster mass normalized integrated SFR of
the Bullet Cluster is among the highest in a sample of eight other clusters and
cluster mergers from the literature. Five LIRGs and one ULIRG contribute 30%
and 40% of the total SFR of the cluster, respectively. To investigate the
origin of the elevated specific SFR, we compare the infrared luminosity
function (IR LF) of the Bullet Cluster to those of Coma (evolved to z=0.297)
and CL1358+62. The Bullet Cluster IR LF exhibits an excess of sources compared
to the IR LFs of the other massive clusters. A Schechter function fit of the
Bullet Cluster IR LF yields L*=44.68+/-0.11 ergs/s, which is ~0.25 and 0.35 dex
brighter than L* of evolved Coma and CL1358+62, respectively. The elevated IR
LF of the Bullet Cluster relative to other clusters can be explained if we
attribute the ""excess"" star-forming IR galaxies to a population associated with
the infalling group that have not yet been transformed into quiescent galaxies.
In this case, the timescale required for quenching star formation in the
cluster environment must be longer than the timescale since the group's
accretion -- a few hundred million years. We suggest that ""strangulation"" is
likely to be an important process in the evolution of star formation in
clusters.

Model of Cosmology (FRW), is embedded as a single point in this family.
Removing a scaling law and imposing regularity at the center, we prove that the
family reduces to an implicitly defined one parameter family of distinct
spacetimes determined by the value of a new {\it acceleration parameter} $a$,
such that $a=1$ corresponds to FRW. We prove that all self-similar spacetimes
in the family are distinct from the non-critical $k\neq0$ Friedmann spacetimes,
thereby {\it characterizing} FRW as the unique spacetime lying at the
intersection of these two one-parameter families. Expanding solutions about the
center in fractional distance to the Hubble Length, we obtain the exact leading
order quadratic and cubic corrections to the redshift vs luminosity relation
for an observer at the center. It follows by continuity that corrections to the
redshift vs luminosity relation observed after the radiation phase of the Big
Bang can be accounted for, at the leading order quadratic level, by adjustment
of the free parameter $a$. The third order correction is then a prediction.
Since self-similar expanding waves represent possible time-asymptotic wave
patterns for the conservation laws associated with the highly nonlinear
radiation phase, we propose to further investigate the possibility that these
corrections to the Standard Model might be the source of the anomalous
acceleration of the galaxies, an explanation wholly within Einstein's equations
with classical sources, and not requiring Dark Energy or the cosmological
constant.

dynamics, because they are potential starting points for adaptive
diversification. The antithesis to evolutionary branching points are
Continuously stable strategies (CSS's), which are convergent stable and
evolutionarily stable equilibrium points of the adaptive dynamics and hence are
thought to represent endpoints of adaptive processes. However, this assessment
is based on situations in which the invasion fitness function determining the
adaptive dynamics have non-zero second derivatives at a CSS. Here we show that
the scope of evolutionary branching can increase if the invasion fitness
function vanishes to higher than first order at a CSS. Using a class of
classical models for frequency-dependent competition, we show that if the
invasion fitness vanishes to higher orders, a CSS may be the starting point for
evolutionary branching, with the only additional requirement that mutant types
need to reach a certain threshold frequency, which can happen e.g. due to
demographic stochasticity. Thus, when invasion fitness functions vanish to
higher than first order at equilibrium points of the adaptive dynamics,
evolutionary diversification can occur even after convergence to an
evolutionarily stable strategy.

more rapid heat loss from and more rapid contraction of the protoplanetary

a substantial speedup in formation time as compared with those previous

physics of interacting particles. Application of a large magnetic field
produces massively degenerate quantum levels known as Landau levels. Within a
Landau level the kinetic energy of the electrons is suppressed, and
electron-electron interactions set the only energy scale. Coulomb interactions
break the degeneracy of the Landau levels and can cause the electrons to order
into complex ground states. In the high energy single particle spectrum of this
system, we observe salient and unexpected structure that extends across a wide
range of Landau level filling fractions. The structure appears only when the
2DES is cooled to very low temperature, indicating that it arises from delicate
ground state correlations. We characterize this structure by its evolution with
changing electron density and applied magnetic field. We present two possible
models for understanding these observations. Some of the energies of the
features agree qualitatively with what might be expected for composite
Fermions, which have proven effective for interpreting other experiments in
this regime. At the same time, a simple model with electrons localized on
ordered lattice sites also generates structure similar to those observed in the
experiment. Neither of these models alone is sufficient to explain the
observations across the entire range of densities measured. The discovery of
this unexpected prominent structure in the single particle spectrum of an
otherwise thoroughly studied system suggests that there exist core features of
the 2DES that have yet to be understood.

  It is known that solutions to the above problem may exhibit singularities -
that is points at which the second derivatives of the solution are unbounded -
as well as degenerate points. This causes breakdown of by-now classical
techniques. Here we introduce new ideas based on Fourier expansion of the
nonlinearity $\chi_{\{u>0\}} $.
  The method turns out to have enough momentum to accomplish a complete
description of the structure of the singular set in ${\mathbb R}^3$.
  A surprising fact in ${\mathbb R}^3$ is that although
$$\frac{u(r\x)}{\sup_{B_1}|u(r\x)|}$$ can converge at singularities to each of
the harmonic polynomials $$ xy, {x^2+y^2\over 2}-z^2 \textrm{and}

The statistics, Tc and Tv, associated with these tests are non-parametric and
defined in terms of the observed cumulative distribution function of sources;
they represent powerful tools for identifying the true flux limit and/or
characterising systematic errors in magnitude-redshift data. In this paper we
present a new approach to constructing these estimators that resembles an
""adaptive smoothing"" procedure - i.e. by seeking to maintain the same amount
the information, as measured by the signal-to-noise ratio, allocated to each
galaxy. For consistency with our previous work, we apply our improved
estimators to the Millennium Galaxy Catalogue (MGC) and the Two Degree Field
Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) data, and demonstrate that one needs to use a
signal-to-noise appropriately tailored for each individual catalogue to
optimise the performance of the completeness estimators. Furthermore, unless
such an adaptive procedure is employed, the assessment of completeness may
result in a spurious outcome if one uses other estimators present in the
literature which have not been designed taking into account ""shot noise"" due to

to filling its Roche lobe, resulting in accretion onto the primary star, which
is often, but not always, a compact object. In many cases, the primary star,
secondary star, and the accretion disk can all be significant sources of
luminosity. SIM Lite will only measure the photocenter of an astrometric
target, and thus determining the true astrometric orbits of such systems will
be difficult. We have modified the Eclipsing Light Curve code (Orosz &
Hauschildt 2000) to allow us to model the flux-weighted reflex motions of
interacting binaries, in a code we call REFLUX. This code gives us sufficient
flexibility to investigate nearly every configuration of interacting binary. We
find that SIM Lite will be able to determine astrometric orbits for all
sufficiently bright interacting binaries where the primary or secondary star
dominates the luminosity. For systems where there are multiple components that
comprise the spectrum in the optical bandpass accessible to SIM Lite, we find
it is possible to obtain absolute masses for both components, although
multi-wavelength photometry will be required to disentangle the multiple
components. In all cases, SIM Lite will at least yield accurate inclinations,
and provide valuable information that will allow us to begin to understand the
complex evolution of mass-transferring binaries. It is critical that SIM Lite
maintains a multi-wavelength capability to allow for the proper deconvolution

preventive measure. Here, a computer-based simulation, tracking the dynamics of
hosts, parasites and parasite-genes, shows that, depending on the degree of
host-population mixing, the frequency of totally recessive autosomes associated
with anthelmintic resistance can follow either a fast dynamical regime with a
low equilibrium point or a slow dynamical regime with a high equilibrium point.
For fully dominant autosomes, only one regime is predicted. The effectiveness
of anthelminthic vaccines against resistance is shown to be strongly influenced
by the underlying dynamics of resistant autosomes. Vaccines targeting adult
parasites, by decreasing helminth fecundity or lifespan, are predicted to be
more effective than vaccines targeting parasite larvae, by decreasing host
susceptibility to infection, in reducing the spread of resistance. These
results may inform new strategies to prevent, monitor and control the spread of
anthelmintic resistance, including the development of viable anthelmintic

sunspots. The existence of positive tension at locations of lower field
strength and higher inclination is compatible with the uncombed model of the
penumbral structure. Positive tension is also seen in umbral light bridges
which could be indication of uncombed structure of the light bridge. Likewise,
the upward directed tension associated with bipolar regions in the penumbra
could be a direct confirmation of the sea serpent model of penumbral
structures. Upward directed tension at the PIL of AR 10930 seems to be related
to flux emergence. The magnitude of the tension force is greater than the force
of gravity in some places, implying a nearly force-free configuration for these
sunspot features. From our study, magnetic tension emerges as a useful
diagnostic of the local equilibrium of the sunspot fine structures.

consists of five independences (tensor, free, Boolean, monotone and
anti-monotone ones). In the present paper, a unified treatment of joint
cumulants is introduced for natural independence. The way we define joint
cumulants enables us not only to find the monotone joint cumulants but also to
give a new characterization of joint cumulants for other kinds of natural
independence, i.e., tensor, free and Boolean independences. We also investigate
relations between generating functions of moments and monotone cumulants. We
find a natural extension of the Muraki formula, which describes the sum of
monotone independent random variables, to the multivariate case.

and then the radiation energy is coming from the energy of magnetic field. Here
it is argued that magnetars may not really exist. Some X-ray and radio
observational results are contradicted with the magnetar model.
  (1) The X-ray luminosity of PSR J1852+0040 is much larger than the rotational
energy loss rate ($L_{X}/\dot {E}_{\rm rot}\simeq 18)$, but the magnetic field
is just $3.1\times 10^{11}$ G. Does this X-ray radiation energy come from the
magnetic field?
  (2) In contrast to the above, the magnetic fields of radio pulsars J1847-0130
and PSR J1718-3718 are higher than that of AXP 1E 2259+586, why is the
radiation energy of those two radio pulsars still coming from rotational

field $B_{\rm C}=4.414$ e13 G) (Esposito et al. 2010).

essential difference between radio pulsars and the ""magnetars""?

chemical enrichment history of the Universe. Specifically, we trace the origin
of the metals back in time to investigate when various gas phases were enriched
and by what halo masses. We find that the age of the metals decreases strongly
with the density of the gas in which they end up. At least half of the metals
that reside in the diffuse intergalactic medium (IGM) at redshift zero (two)
were ejected from galaxies above redshift two (three). The mass of the haloes
that last contained the metals increases rapidly with the gas density. More
than half of the mass in intergalactic metals was ejected by haloes with total
masses less than 1e11 solar masses and stellar masses less than 1e9 solar
masses. The range of halo masses that contributes to the enrichment is wider
for the hotter part of the IGM. By combining the `when' and `by what' aspects
of the enrichment history, we show that metals residing in lower density gas
were typically ejected earlier and by lower mass haloes.

star-formation site. This is mainly due to its morphology, because the central
OB cluster NGC 2244 has blown a circular-shaped cavity into the cloud and the
expanding HII-region now interacts with the cloud. Studying the spatial
distribution of the different evolutionary states of all star-forming sites in
Rosette and investigating possible gradients of the dust temperature will help
to test the 'triggered star-formation' scenario in Rosette. We use continuum
data obtained with the PACS (70 and 160 micron) and SPIRE instruments (250,
350, 500 micron) of the Herschel telescope during the Science Demonstration
Phase of HOBYS. Three-color images of Rosette impressively show how the
molecular gas is heated by the radiative impact of the NGC 2244 cluster. A
clear negative temperature gradient and a positive density gradient (running
from the HII-region/molecular cloud interface into the cloud) are detected.
Studying the spatial distribution of the most massive dense cores (size scale
0.05 to 0.3 pc), we find an age-sequence (from more evolved to younger) with
increasing distance to the cluster NGC 2244. No clear gradient is found for the
clump (size-scale up to 1 pc) distribution. The existence of temperature and
density gradients and the observed age-sequence imply that star formation in
Rosette may indeed be influenced by the radiative impact of the central NGC
2244 cluster. A more complete overview of the prestellar and protostellar
population in Rosette is required to obtain a firmer result.

also the phase noise introduced by the FBA and used a new and simple technique

about 0.2 dex, nitrogen is overabundant by about 0.3 dex and oxygen is

However, the planetary/sub-stellar companion previously suggested to exist in

decrease detected in NN Ser is continuing, with magnetic braking or a third
body the only mechanisms able to explain this change. The planetary/sub-stellar
companion previously suggested to exist in NN Ser is also ruled out by our
data. Our precise eclipse times also lead to improved ephemerides for DE CVn
and GK Vir. The width of a primary eclipse is directly related to the size of
the secondary star and variations in the size of this star could be an
indication of Applegate's mechanism or Wilson (starspot) depressions which can
cause jitter in the O-C curves. We measure the width of primary eclipses for
the systems NN Ser and GK Vir over several years but find no definitive
variations in the radii of the secondary stars. However, our data are precise
enough (dRsec / Rsec < 10^-5) to show the effects of Applegate's mechanism in

find tentative indications that flaring rates of the secondary stars depend on

their observed distribution gives us an insight into both processes. We find
that the two gases paint quite different pictures of seasonal change. Whilst
the 2-D cross-section of C2H6 abundance is slightly increased and more
symmetric in 2000 (northern summer solstice) compared to 1979 (northern fall
equinox), the major trend of equator to pole increase remains. For C2H2 on the
other hand, the Voyager epoch exhibits almost no latitudinal variation, whilst
the Cassini era shows a marked decrease polewards in both hemispheres. At the

there are no published models of 2-D Jovian seasonal chemical variation

uses only the blast wave fluid Lorentz factor and therefore leads to an

are chromatic across the self-absorption break. Depending on circumstances, the
radio jet break may be postponed significantly. Using high-accuracy adaptive
mesh fluid simulations in one dimension, coupled to a detailed synchrotron
radiation code, we demonstrate that this is true even for the standard fireball
model and hard-edged jets. We confirm these effects with a simulation in two
dimensions. The frequency dependence of the jet break is a result of the angle
dependence of the emission, the changing optical depth in the self-absorbed
regime and the shape of the synchrotron spectrum in general. In the optically
thin case the conventional analysis systematically overestimates the jet break
time, leading to inferred opening angles that are underestimated by a factor
1.32 and explosion energies that are underestimated by a factor 1.73, for

These charge qubits couple linearly to the charge in the arms of the MZI. A key
advantage of an MZI is that the qubits are well separated in distance so that
mutual interaction between them is avoided. Assuming equal coupling between
both DQDs and the arms and the same bias for each DQD, this setup usually
detects three different currents, one for the odd states and two for each even
state. Controlling the magnetic flux of the MZI, we can operate the MZI as a
parity meter: only two currents are measured at the output, one for each parity
class. In this configuration, the MZI acts as an ideal detector, its Heisenberg
efficiency being maximal. For a class of initial states, the initially
unentangled DQDs become entangled through the parity measurement process with
probability one.

  Times","20 pages, 8 figures",,"10.1063/1.3485285",,"cond-mat.stat-mech","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In many dynamical systems there is a large separation of time scales between
typical events and ""rare"" events which can be the cases of interest. Rare-event
rates are quite difficult to compute numerically, but they are of considerable
practical importance in many fields: for example transition times in chemical
physics and extinction times in epidemiology can be very long, but are quite
important. We present a very fast numerical technique that can be used to find
long transition times (very small rates) in low-dimensional systems, even if
they lack detailed balance. We illustrate the method for a bistable
non-equilibrium system introduced by Maier and Stein and a two-dimensional (in
parameter space) epidemiology model.

theory of classical logic: Gentzen's cut-elimination for the sequent calculus
and Herbrands ""fundamental theorem"". Starting from Miller's
expansion-tree-proofs, a highly structured way presentation of Herbrand's
theorem, we define a calculus of weakening-free proof nets for (prenex)
first-order classical logic, and give a weakly-normalizing cut-elimination
procedure. It is not possible to formulate the usual counterexamples to
confluence of cut-elimination in this calculus, but it is nonetheless
nonconfluent, lending credence to the view that classical logic is inherently
nonconfluent.

are detectable sources of gravitational waves in the LISA band. In many of
these events, the white dwarf begins to lose mass during the main observational
phase of the inspiral. The mass loss starts gently and can last for thousands
of orbits. The white dwarf matter overflows the Roche lobe through the $L_1$
point at each pericenter passage and the mass loss repeats periodically. The
process occurs very close to the black hole and the released gas can accrete,
creating a bright source of radiation with luminosity close to the Eddington
limit, $L\sim 10^{43}$~erg~s$^{-1}$. This class of inspirals offers a promising
scenario for dual detections of gravitational waves and electromagnetic
radiation.

threefolds.

higher Fermi level, a strong reduction of the large gap BCS ratio 2\Delta/k_B

discussed.

their small spin-orbit coupling and low hyperfine interaction is expected to

spin-relaxation length is not necessarily large when transport is via weakly
interacting molecular orbitals. Here we use graphite as a model system and
study spin transport in the direction perpendicular to the weakly bonded
graphene sheets. We achieve injection of highly (75%) spin-polarized electrons
into graphite nanostructures of 300-500 nm across and up to 17 nm thick, and
observe transport without any measurable loss of spin information. Direct
visualization of local spin transport in graphite-based spin-valve sandwiches
also shows spatially uniform and near-unity transmission for electrons at 1.8

spacecraft to track streamer blobs into the heliosphere and to observe them
being swept up and compressed by the fast wind from low-latitude coronal holes.
From an analysis of their elongation/time tracks, we discover a 'locus of
enhanced visibility' where neighboring blobs pass each other along the line of
sight and their corotating spiral is seen edge on. The detailed shape of this
locus accounts for a variety of east-west asymmetries and allows us to
recognize the spiral of blobs by its signatures in the STEREO images: In the
eastern view from STEREO-A, the leading edge of the spiral is visible as a
moving wavefront where foreground ejections overtake background ejections
against the sky and then fade. In the western view from STEREO-B, the leading
edge is only visible close to the Sun-spacecraft line where the radial path of
ejections nearly coincides with the line of sight. In this case, we can track
large-scale waves continuously back to the lower corona and see that they
originate as face-on blobs.
