PACS 100 and 160um observations of the GOODS-N field with 2Msec Chandra data,
we detect ~20% of X-ray AGN individually at >3sig. The host far-infrared
luminosity of AGN with L2-10~10^43erg/s increases with redshift by an order of
magnitude from z=0 to z~1. In contrast, there is little dependence of
far-infrared luminosity on AGN luminosity, for L2-10<~10^44erg/s AGN at z>~1.
We do not find a dependence of far-infrared luminosity on X-ray obscuring
column, for our sample which is dominated by L2-10<10^44erg/s AGN. In
conjunction with properties of local and luminous high-z AGN, we interpret
these results as reflecting the interplay between two paths of AGN/host
coevolution. A correlation of AGN luminosity and host star formation is traced
locally over a wide range of luminosities and also extends to luminous high z
AGN. This correlation reflects an evolutionary connection, likely via merging.
For lower AGN luminosities, star formation is similar to that in non-active
massive galaxies and shows little dependence on AGN luminosity. The level of
this secular, non-merger driven star formation increasingly dominates over the
correlation at increasing redshift.

forming interstellar medium in the nearby, metal-poor spiral galaxy M33,
exploiting the high resolution and sensitivity of Herschel. We use PACS and
SPIRE maps at 100, 160, 250, 350, and 500 micron wavelength, to study the
variation of the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) with galacto-centric
distance. Detailed SED modeling is performed using azimuthally averaged fluxes
in elliptical rings of 2 kpc width, out to 8 kpc galacto-centric distance.
Simple isothermal and two-component grey body models, with fixed dust
emissivity index, are fitted to the SEDs between 24 and 500 micron using also
MIPS/Spitzer data, to derive first estimates of the dust physical conditions.
The far-infrared and submillimeter maps reveal the branched, knotted spiral
structure of M33. An underlying diffuse disk is seen in all SPIRE maps (250-500
micron). Two component fits to the SEDs agree better than isothermal models
with the observed, total and radially averaged flux densities. The two
component model, with beta fixed at 1.5, best fits the global and the radial
SEDs. The cold dust component clearly dominates; the relative mass of the warm
component is less than 0.3% for all the fits. The temperature of the warm
component is not well constrained and is found to be about 60K plus/minus 10K.
The temperature of the cold component drops significantly from about 24K in the
inner 2 kpc radius to 13K beyond 6 kpc radial distance, for the best fitting
model. The gas-to-dust ratio for beta=1.5, averaged over the galaxy, is higher
than the solar value by a factor of 1.5 and is roughly in agreement with the
subsolar metallicity of M33.

nodes have minimal knowledge about their environment and severely limited
communication capabilities. Specifically, nodes have no information regarding
the local or global structure of the network, don't have access to synchronized
clocks and are woken up by an adversary. Moreover, instead on communicating
through messages they rely solely on carrier sensing to exchange information.
We study the problem of \emph{interval coloring}, a variant of vertex coloring
specially suited for the studied beeping model. Given a set of resources, the
goal of interval coloring is to assign every node a large contiguous fraction
of the resources, such that neighboring nodes share no resources. To highlight
the importance of the discreteness of the model, we contrast it against a
continuous variant described in [17]. We present an O(1$ time algorithm that
terminates with probability 1 and assigns an interval of size
$\Omega(T/\Delta)$ that repeats every $T$ time units to every node of the
network. This improves an $O(\log n)$ time algorithm with the same guarantees
presented in \cite{infocom09}, and accentuates the unrealistic assumptions of
the continuous model. Under the more realistic discrete model, we present a Las
Vegas algorithm that solves $\Omega(T/\Delta)$-interval coloring in $O(\log n)$
time with high probability and describe how to adapt the algorithm for dynamic
networks where nodes may join or leave. For constant degree graphs we prove a
lower bound of $\Omega(\log n)$ on the time required to solve interval coloring
for this model against randomized algorithms. This lower bound implies that our
algorithm is asymptotically optimal for constant degree graphs.

superradiance, we illustrate how the multi-excitonic states exhibit
`supertransfer' in the far-field regime: hopping from a symmetrized state over
N sites to a symmetrized state over M sites at a rate proportional to MN. We
argue that such symmetries could play an operational role in physical systems

environmental fluctuations are key factors that can facilitate or disrupt
coexistence. To better understand this interplay between these deterministic
and stochastic forces, we develop a mathematical theory extending the nonlinear
theory of permanence for deterministic systems to stochastic difference and
differential equations. Our condition for coexistence requires that there is a
fixed set of weights associated with the interacting populations and this
weighted combination of populations' invasion rates is positive for any
(ergodic) stationary distribution associated with a subcollection of
populations. Here, an invasion rate corresponds to an average per-capita growth
rate along a stationary distribution. When this condition holds and there is
sufficient noise in the system, we show that the populations approach a unique
positive stationary distribution. Moreover, we show that our coexistence
criterion is robust to small perturbations of the model functions. Using this
theory, we illustrate that (i) environmental noise enhances or inhibits
coexistence in communities with rock-paper-scissor dynamics depending on
correlations between interspecific demographic rates, (ii) stochastic variation
in mortality rates has no effect on the coexistence criteria for discrete-time
Lotka-Volterra communities, and (iii) random forcing can promote genetic

(3.6-70 microns) to construct complete spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of
compact sources. From these, we identify 207 candidate embedded YSOs in the
observed region, ~40% never-before identified. We discuss their position in
far-infrared color-magnitude space, comparing with previously studied,
spectroscopically confirmed YSOs and maser emission. All have red colors
indicating massive cool envelopes and great youth. We analyze four example
YSOs, determining their physical properties by fitting their SEDs with
radiative transfer models. Fitting full SEDs including the Herschel data

in agreement with previous outflow studies of high-mass protostars. Our results
show that Herschel provides reliable longwave SEDs of large samples of

leads to a resonant transfer between the chosen qubits, and to a detuning of
all remaining pathways in the network, using only global manipulations. As the
transfer is perfect when the selected pathway is mediated by 2 or 3 spins,

discuss the importance of the initial-final mass relationship for the white
dwarf carbon-oxygen composition. In particular, we find that the central oxygen
abundance may be underestimated by about 15% if the white dwarf mass is assumed
to be the hydrogen-free core mass before the first thermal pulse. We also
discuss the importance for the chemical profiles expected in the outermost
layers of ZZ Ceti stars of the computation of the thermally-pulsing AGB phase
and of the phase in which element diffusion is relevant. We find a strong
dependence of the outer layer chemical stratification on the stellar mass. In
particular, in the less massive models, the double-layered structure in the
helium layer built up during the thermally-pulsing AGB phase is not removed by
diffusion by the time the ZZ Ceti stage is reached. Finally, we perform
adiabatic pulsation calculations and discuss the implications of our new
chemical profiles for the pulsational properties of ZZ Ceti stars. We find that
the whole $g-$mode period spectrum and the mode-trapping properties of these

a long history. These processes can be used to translate realistic problems
into mathematical ones in a natural way. In general, the goal of a
balls-into-bins process is to allocate a set of independent objects (tasks,
jobs, balls) to a set of resources (servers, bins, urns) and, thereby, to
minimize the maximum load. In this paper, we analyze the maximum load for the
{\em chains-into-bins} problem, which is defined as follows. There are $n$
bins, and $m$ objects to be allocated. Each object consists of balls connected
into a chain of length $\ell$, so that there are $m \ell$ balls in total. We
assume the chains cannot be broken, and that the balls in one chain have to be
allocated to $\ell$ consecutive bins. We allow each chain $d$ independent and
uniformly random bin choices for its starting position. The chain is allocated
using the rule that the maximum load of any bin receiving a ball of that chain
is minimized. We show that, for $d \ge 2$ and $m\cdot\ell=O(n)$, the maximum
load is $((\ln \ln m)/\ln d) +O(1)$ with probability $1-\tilde O(1/m^{d-1})$.

restrict the analysis to distances larger than 25 kpc from the Galactic center,
where the density profile of halo stars is well approximated by a single power
law with logarithmic slope between -3.5 and -4.5. With this restriction, we
also avoid the complication of modeling a flattened Galactic disk. In the range
25 < r < 80 kpc, the radial velocity dispersion declines remarkably little; a
robust measure of its logarithmic slope is between -0.05 and -0.1. The circular
velocity profile also declines remarkably little with radius. The allowed range
of V_c(80 kpc) lies between 175 and 231 km/s, with the most likely value 193
km/s. Compared with the value at the solar location, the Galactic circular
velocity declines by less than 20% over an order of magnitude in radius. Such a
flat profile requires a massive and extended dark matter halo. The mass
enclosed within 80 kpc is 6.9(+3.0-1.2) 10^11 Msun. Our sample of radial
velocities is large enough that the biggest uncertainty in the mass is not

Bethe-Heitler pair production by protons also contributes to the cascade and
can tighten the neutrino constraints in models where extragalactic cosmic rays
begin to dominate over the galactic component at a relatively low ""crossover""

measurements of the diffuse extragalactic gamma ray background and illustrate
by a fit to the HiRes spectrum how the prediction of the cosmogenic neutrino
flux in all-proton models varies with the crossover energy. The neutrino flux
is required to be smaller when the gamma-ray bound is applied, nevertheless
such models are still consistent with HiRes and Fermi-LAT if one properly takes

galaxy at $z=1.701$, strongly-lensed by the foreground galaxy cluster RCS2
032727-132623 at $z=0.564$. The giant arc extends over $\sim 38$\,\arcsec and
has an integrated $g$-band magnitude of 19.15, making it $\sim 20$ times larger
and $\sim 4$ times brighter than the prototypical lensed galaxy MS1512-cB58.
This is the brightest distant lensed galaxy in the Universe known to date. Its
location in the `redshift desert' provides unique opportunities to connect
between the large samples of galaxies known at $z\sim3$ and $z\sim1$. We have
collected photometry in 9 bands, ranging from $u$ to $K_s$, which densely
sample the rest-frame UV and optical light, including the age-sensitive
4000\AA\ break. A lens model is constructed for the system, and results in a
robust total magnification of $2.04 \pm 0.16$ for the counter-image; we
estimate an average magnification of $17.2 \pm 1.4$ for the giant arc based on
the relative physical scales of the arc and counter-image. Fits of
single-component spectral energy distribution (SED) models to the photometry
result in a moderately young age, $t = 115 \pm 65$\,Myr, small amounts of dust,
$E(B-V) \le 0.035$, and an exponentially declining star formation history with
\textit{e}-folding time $\tau = 10-100$\,Myr. After correcting for the lensing
magnification, we find a stellar mass of
$\log(\mathrm{M}/\mathrm{M}_\odot)=10.0 \pm 0.1$. Allowing for episodic star
formation, an underlying old burst could contain up to twice the mass inferred
from single-component modeling. This stellar mass estimate is consistent with
the average stellar mass of a sample of `BM' galaxies ($1.4 < z < 2.0$) studied
by Reddy et al. (2006).

formation of gas giant planets by disk fragmentation in the outer regions of
massive disks. In this study, we use three-dimensional radiative hydrodynamics
simulations and model solids as a spatial distribution of particles. We assume
that half of the total solid fraction is in small grains and half in large
solids. The former are perfectly entrained with the gas and set the opacity in
the disk, while the latter are allowed to respond to gas drag forces, with the
back reaction on the gas taken into account. To explore the maximum effects of
gas-solid interactions, we first consider 10cm-size particles. We then compare
these results to a simulation with 1 km-size particles, which explores the
low-drag regime. We show that (1) disk instability planets have the potential
to form large cores due to aerodynamic capturing of rock-size solids in spiral
arms before fragmentation; (2) that temporary clumps can concentrate tens of
$M_{\oplus}$ of solids in very localized regions before clump disruption; (3)
that the formation of permanent clumps, even in the outer disk, is dependent on
the grain-size distribution, i.e., the opacity; (4) that nonaxisymmetric
structure in the disk can create disk regions that have a solids-to-gas ratio
greater than unity; (5) that the solid distribution may affect the
fragmentation process; (6) that proto-gas giants and proto-brown dwarfs can
start as differentiated objects prior to the H$_2$ collapse phase; (7) that
spiral arms in a gravitationally unstable disk are able to stop the inward
drift of rock-size solids, even redistributing them to larger radii; and, (8)
that large solids can form spiral arms that are offset from the gaseous spiral
arms. We conclude that planet embryo formation can be strongly affected by the
growth of solids during the earliest stages of disk accretion.

ultraviolet (UV) is dominated by emission from stars, either directly or
through absorption and reradiation by dust. It can thus give information on the
star formation history of the universe. However, it is difficult to measure
directly due to foreground radiation fields from the Galaxy and solar system.
Gamma-rays from extragalactic sources at cosmological distances (blazars and
gamma-ray bursts) interact with EBL photons creating electron-positron pairs,
absorbing the gamma-rays. Given the intrinsic gamma-ray spectrum of a source
and its redshift, the EBL can in principle be measured. However, the intrinsic
gamma-ray spectra of blazars and GRBs can vary considerably from source to
source and the from the same source over short timescales. A maximum intrinsic
spectrum can be assumed from theoretical grounds, to give upper limits on the
EBL absorption from blazars at low redshift with very high energy (VHE)
gamma-ray observations with ground-based Atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes. The
Fermi-LAT observations of blazars and GRBs can probe EBL absorption at higher
redshifts. The lower energy portion of the LAT spectrum of these sources is
unattenuated by the EBL, so that extrapolating this to higher energies can give
the maximum intrinsic spectrum for a source. Comparing this to the observed
higher energy LAT spectrum will then give upper limits on the EBL absorption.
For blazars which have been detected by both the Fermi-LAT and at higher
energies by Cherenkov telescopes, combined LAT-VHE observations can put more
stringent constraints on the low redshift EBL. These procedures above can also
be reversed: for sources with an unknown redshift, a given EBL model and
gamma-ray spectrum can lead to an upper limit on the source's redshift.

together with his famed time-dependent wave-function equation that analogously
treats the operator quantization of its Hamiltonian. The resulting formally
four-vector equation system assures proper relativistic covariance for any
solitary-particle Hamiltonian operator which, together with its canonical
three-momentum operator, is a Lorentz-covariant four-vector operator. This, of
course, is always the case for the quantization of the Hamiltonian of a
properly relativistic classical theory, so the strong correspondence principle
definitely remains valid in the relativistic domain. Klein-Gordon theory
impairs this four-vector equation by iterating and contracting it, thereby
injecting extraneous negative-energy solutions that are not orthogonal to their
positive-energy counterparts of the same momentum, thus destroying the basis of
the quantum probability interpretation. Klein-Gordon theory, which thus depends
on the square of the Hamiltonian operator, is as well thereby cut adrift from
Heisenberg's equations of motion. Dirac theory confuses the space-time symmetry
of the four-vector equation system with such symmetry for its time component
alone, which it fatuously imposes, thereby breaching the strong correspondence
principle for the free particle and imposing the starkly unphysical

precision, good statistics, and homogeneity to detect them. We also computed
suitable sets of stellar models (BaSTI) for various assumptions about the

attributed to variations in He content are generally detectable between stars
of the Primordial (P, first-generation) and Extreme (E, second-generation)

exception (differences are significant also between P and I populations) is
NGC2808, where three populations are clearly separated also on the Main

nonlinear/non-Gaussian systems. We introduce a framework, called the scaled
unscented transform Gaussian sum filter (SUT-GSF), which combines two ideas:
the scaled unscented Kalman filter (SUKF) based on the concept of scaled
unscented transform (SUT), and the Gaussian mixture model (GMM). The SUT is
used to approximate the mean and covariance of a Gaussian random variable which
is transformed by a nonlinear function, while the GMM is adopted to approximate
the probability density function (pdf) of a random variable through a set of
Gaussian distributions. With these two tools, a framework can be set up to
assimilate nonlinear systems in a recursive way. Within this framework, one can
treat a nonlinear stochastic system as a mixture model of a set of sub-systems,
each of which takes the form of a nonlinear system driven by a known Gaussian
random process. Then, for each sub-system, one applies the SUKF to estimate the
mean and covariance of the underlying Gaussian random variable transformed by
the nonlinear governing equations of the sub-system. Incorporating the
estimations of the sub-systems into the GMM gives an explicit (approximate)
form of the pdf, which can be regarded as a ""complete"" solution to the state
estimation problem, as all of the statistical information of interest can be
obtained from the explicit form of the pdf ...
  This work is on the construction of the Gaussian sum filter based on the
scaled unscented transform.

regions. The method is based on equi-distribution principal and dimension
reduction. The mesh generation is carried out by first producing some adaptive
nodes in a rectangle based on equi-distribution along the coordinate axes and
then transforming the generated nodes to the physical domain. Since the
produced mesh is applied to the meshless-type methods, the connectivity of the
points is not used and only the grid points are important, though the grid
lines are utilized in the adapting process. The performance of the adaptive
points is examined by considering a collocation meshless method which is based
on interpolation in terms of a set of radial basis functions.
  A generalized thin plate spline with sufficient smoothness is used as a basis
function and the arc-length is employed as a monitor in the equi-distribution
process.
  Some experimental results will be presented to illustrate the effectiveness
of the proposed method.

variational energy in the two dimensional representation space of d-wave

is reached by the non-chiral $d_{xy}$ state with line nodes. We also find that
the usual Gutzwiller approximation, which enjoys great success for the square
lattice system, fails badly on the triangular lattice as a result of the
geometric frustration inherent of the system. An improved version of the
Gutzwiiler approximation is proposed and is found to give a much better results

proviola based on the ProofWeb system. ProofWeb uncouples the interaction with
a PA via a web- interface (the client) from the actual PA that resides on the
server. Our camera films a movie by ""listening"" to the ProofWeb communication.
The first reason for developing movies is to uncouple the reviewing of a formal
proof from the PA used to develop it: the movie concept enables users to
discuss small code fragments without the need to install the PA or to load a
whole library into it. Other advantages include the possibility to develop a
separate com- mentary track to discuss or explain the PA interaction. We assert
that a combined camera+proviola provides a generic layer between a client
(user) and a server (PA). Finally we claim that movies are the right type of

$s_{\rm p}>0$, the onset of the perturbative QCD continuum in Minkowski space
\cite{BLR,Rafa,PPR}. To approximate the hadronic spectral function in the
region $s>s_{\rm p}$, we use Analytic Perturbation Theory (APT) up to the fifth
order. A new feature of our procedure is that it enables us to extract from the
data simultaneously the QCD scale parameter $\Lambda_{\bar{\rm MS}}$ and the
boundary energy squared $s_{\rm p}$. We carefully determine the experimental
errors on these parameters which come from the errors on the invariant mass
squared distribution. For the $\bar{\rm MS}$ scheme coupling constant, we
obtain $\alpha_s(m^{2}_{\tau})=0.308\pm 0.014_{\rm exp.}$. We show that our
numerical analysis is more stable against higher-order corrections than the
standard one. The extracted value for the duality point $s_{\rm p}$ is found
surprisingly stable against perturbation theory corrections $s_{\rm d}= 1.71\pm

water has been recently shown by Schmidt et al. [J. Phys. chem. B, 113, 11959

correlation, and corrected by the addition of interatomic pair potentials to
describe van derWaals (vdW) interactions. In this contribution we present a
DFTAIMD study of liquid water using several GGA functionals as well as the van
der Waals density functional (vdW-DF) of Dion et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92,
246401(2004)]. As expected, we find that the density of water is grossly
underestimated by GGA functionals. When a vdW-DF is used, the density improves
drastically and the experimental diffusivity is reproduced without the need of
thermal corrections. We analyze the origin of the density differences between
all the functionals. We show that the vdW-DF increases the population of
non-H-bonded interstitial sites, at distances between the first and second
coordination shells. However, it excessively weakens the H-bond network,
collapsing the second coordination shell. This structural problem is partially
associated to the choice of GGA exchange in the vdW-DF. We show that a
different choice for the exchange functional is enough to achieve an overall
improvement both in structure and diffusivity.

particles and fundamental forces. Instead a plethora of particles and a
diaspora of forces are perceived merely as diverse manifestations of a natural
selection for various mechanisms and ways to decrease free energy in the least
time.

"1006.2295","Alexander Parkhomov","A.G. Parkhomov","Effect of radioactivity decrease. Is there a link with solar flares?","7 pages, 5 figures",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Results obtained with multichannel installation created for long-term studies
of various processes, are collated with the data published by J.H. Jenkins and
E.Fischbach, who found a decrease of 54Mn radioactivity near the time of series
of solar flares between 5 and 17 December 2006. Analysis of the data from our
installation in December 2006 has not revealed any deviations from the usual
behaviour of the count rates for 90Sr-90Y, 60Co and 239Pu sources. The same can
be said of the data collected during the period of highly powerful solar flares
between 19 October and 4 November 2003. Apparent drops in the count rate were
detected between 10 and 12 May 2002 while registering the activity of 60Co and
on 19 and 20 June 2004 for 90Sr-90Y source. Around the time of these events, no
observations of large solar flares were reported. Thus, proposed link between
the drop in the rates of radioactive decay and appearance of solar flares could
not be confirmed. From obtained outcomes follows, that the radioactivity drop
effect, if it really exists, is rather rare, and that the reason calling this
effect unequally influences various radioactive sources.
