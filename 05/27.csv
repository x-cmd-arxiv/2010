H-test for periodicity in X-ray and $\gamma$-ray arrival times, which is
already extensively used by the $\gamma$-ray pulsar community. Also, to obtain
an analytical probability distribution for stacked test statistics in the case
of a search for pulsed emission from an ensemble of pulsars where the
significance per pulsar is relatively low, making individual detections
insignificant on their own. This information is timely given the recent rapid
discovery of new pulsars with the Fermi-LAT t $\gamma$-ray telescope. Methods:
Approximately $10^{14}$ realisations of the H-statistic ($H$) for random
(white) noise is calculated from a random number generator for which the
repitition cycle is $\gg 10^{14}$. From these numbers the probability
distribution $P(>H)$ is calculated. Results: The distribution of $H$ is is
found to be exponential with parameter $\lambda=0.4$ so that the cumulative
probability distribution $P(>H)=\exp{(-\lambda H)}$. If we stack independent
values for $H$, the sum of $K$ such values would follow the Erlang-K
distribution with parameter $\lambda$ for which the cumulative probability
distribution is also a simple analytical expression. Conclusion: Searches for
weak pulsars with unknown pulse profile shapes in the Fermi-LAT, Agile or other
X-ray data bases should benefit from the {\it H-test} since it is known to be
powerful against a broad range of pulse profiles, which introduces only a
single statistical trial if only the {\it H-test} is used. The new probability
distribution presented here favours the detection of weaker pulsars in terms of
an improved sensitivity relative to the previously known distribution.

this question depends not only on the structure of the network, but also on
details of the dynamic processes occurring on it. We classify these processes
as conservative and non-conservative. A random walk on a network is an example
of a conservative dynamic process, while information spread is
non-conservative. The influence models used to rank network nodes can be
similarly classified, depending on the dynamic process they implicitly emulate.
We claim that in order to correctly rank network nodes, the influence model has
to match the details of the dynamic process. We study a real-world network on
the social news aggregator Digg, which allows users to post and vote for news
stories. We empirically define influence as the number of in-network votes a
user's post generates. This influence measure, and the resulting ranking,
arises entirely from the dynamics of voting on Digg, which represents
non-conservative information flow.
  We then compare predictions of different influence models with this empirical
estimate of influence. The results show that non-conservative models are better
able to predict influential users on Digg. We find that normalized
alpha-centrality metric turns out to be one of the best predictors of
influence. We also present a simple algorithm for computing this metric and the
associated mathematical formulation and analytical proofs.

progressively rising flux since November 10, 2009. The gamma-ray flux reached a
value comparable with that of the Vela pulsar on December 2, 2009. Remarkably,
between December 2 and 3, 2009 the source more than doubled its gamma-ray

of F_{\gamma,p} = (2000 \pm 400) x 10^-8 ph cm^-2 s^-1 for a 1-day integration

source flux remaining at large values near F \simeq (1000 \pm 200) x 10^-8 ph

among the largest ever detected intrinsic radiated power in gamma-rays above

large radial data in the energy space. This equation admits a unique positive
stationary solution, called the ground state. In 1975, Payne and Sattinger
showed that solutions with energy strictly below that of the ground state are
divided into two classes, depending on a suitable functional: If it is
negative, then one has finite time blowup, if it is nonnegative, global
existence; moreover, these sets are invariant under the flow. Recently,
Ibrahim, Masmoudi and the first author improved this result by establishing
scattering to zero in the global existence case by means of a variant of the
Kenig-Merle method. In this paper we go slightly beyond the ground state energy
and give a complete description of the evolution. For example, in a small
neighborhood of the ground states one encounters the following trichotomy: on
one side of a center-stable manifold one has finite-time blowup, on the other
side scattering to zero, and on the manifold itself one has scattering to the
ground state, all for positive time. In total, the class of initial data is
divided into nine disjoint nonempty sets, each displaying different asymptotic
behavior, which includes solutions blowing up in one time direction and
scattering to zero on the other, and also, the analogue of those found by
Duyckaerts and Merle for the energy critical wave and Schr\""odinger equations,
exactly with the ground state energy. The main technical ingredient is a
""one-pass"" theorem which excludes the existence of ""almost homoclinic"" orbits
between the ground states.

exposed to electromagnetic (e/m) waves in the infrared (IR) regime, is
attracted by e/m waves. The result may seem surprising and against conventional
wisdom that electromagnetic wave forcing should lead to a repulsive force.
Nonetheless, all our experiments show that the attractive force can be
determined quantitatively, and that they are reproducible. Our experiment setup
is a Cavendish torsion-balance experiment with lead spheres, one of the spheres
intermittently irradiated by IR light. Because the Cavendish experiment is well
known, simple, and readily available, the results can be easily verified or
falsified. However, to avoid Bernoulli and other external forcing effects, the
entire experimental setup should be placed in a vacuum chamber. In our case the
experiments were performed at \approx 4 \cdot 10^-7 mbar. One of the 20 g lead
spheres was intermittently irradiated by infrared radiation from a lamp covered
by an aluminium foil. Two independent experiments (V1 and V2) are described.
Besides showing that wave energy and momentum transfer leads to attraction, we
also describe some experimental requirements and constraints. The lamp was
powered on during 10 or 12 s, the power changing between 8, 16, and 26 W. All
measurements, including those affected by lamp out-gassing, shows that the
attracting force on the lead sphere increases with increasing irradiative
energy. From the V2 experiment, preceded by lamp ""baking"" to eliminate
repulsive out-gassing forces, the irradiative energy 8.7 Ws on the sphere
resulted in a total force 2.9+/-0.5\cdot 10^-9 (N). From the V2 experiment we
also derive a power law relation between incident radiation energy (W) and the
attractive force, corresponding to F=2.8\cdot 10^-10 W^1.1, with R^2=0.95.

Around 90% of Seyfert 1 AGN in bulge-dominated host galaxies (without disk
contamination) span a very narrow range in the observed 12um to 2-10keV
luminosity ratio (1<R_{IR/X}<7). This narrow dispersion incorporates all
possible variations among AGN central engines, including accretion mechanism
and efficiency, disk opening angle, orientation to sightline, covering fraction
of absorbing material, patchiness of X-ray corona and measured variability. As
a result, all models of X-ray and IR production in AGN are very strongly
constrained. Among Seyfert 1 AGN, median X-ray and IR luminosities increase
with black hole mass at >99% confidence. Using ring morphology of the host
galaxy as a proxy for lack of tidal interaction, we find that AGN luminosity in
host galaxies within 70Mpc is independent of host galaxy interaction for $\sim$
Gyrs, suggesting that the timescale of AGN activity due to secular evolution is
much shorter than that due to tidal interactions. We find that LINER hosts have
lower 12um luminosity than the median 12um luminosity of normal disk- and
bulge-dominated galaxies which may represent observational evidence for past
epochs of feedback that supressed star formation in LINER host galaxies. We
propose that nuclear ULXs may account for the X-ray emission from LINER 2s
without flat-spectrum, compact radio cores. We confirmed the robustness of our
results in X-rays by comparing them with the 14-195keV 22-month BAT survey of

A theoretical field formalism is employed, and we find that the system exhibits

Dirac's Lagrangian that describes the system. The Peierls instability is
introduced in the chains by coupling a scalar field to the fermions of the

separates two vacuum regions, i.e., two spacial configurations (enantiomers) of

nuclear-magnetic-resonance (NMR) measurements reveals important information of
the ground-state properties of CeRu$_4$Sn$_6$, which has been proposed as a
rare example of a tetragonal Kondo-insulator (KI). The NMR
spin-latticerelaxation rate $1/T_1$ deviates from the Korringa law below 100 K
signaling the onset of an energy gap $\Delta E_g1/k_B \simeq 30$K. This gap is
stable against magnetic fields up to 10 T. Below 10 K, however, unusual
low-energy excitations of in-gap states are observed, which depend strongly on
the field H. The specific heat C detects these excitations in the form of an
enhanced Sommerfeld coefficient $\gamma = C(T)/T$ : In zero field, $\gamma$
increases steeply below 5 K, reaching a maximum at 0.1 K, and then saturates at
$\gamma = 0.6$ J/molK$^2$. This maximum is shifted to higher temperatures with
increasing field suggesting a residual density of states at the Fermi level
developing a spin gap $\Delta E_g2$. A simple model, based on two narrow
quasiparticle bands located at the Fermi level - which cross the Fermi level in
zero field at 0.022 states/meV f.u. - can account qualitatively as well as
quantitatively for the measured observables. In particular, it is demonstrated
that fitting our data of both specific heat and NMR to the model, incorporating
a Ce magnetic moment of $\mu = \Delta E_g1/\mu_{0H} \simeq 1 \mu_B$, leads to
the prediction of the field dependence of the gap. Our measurements rule out
the presence of a quantum critical point as the origin for the enhanced
$\gamma$ in CeRu$_4$Sn$_6$ and suggest that this arises rather from correlated,
residual in-gap states at the Fermi level. This work provides a fundamental
route for future investigations into the phenomenon of narrow-gap formation in
the strongly correlated class of system

by electromagnetic (e/m) waves in plasmas. The Miller force, sometimes denoted
the gradient force, is of particular interest, because the direction as well as
magnitude of the Miller force on a plasma depends on the wave frequency. While
plasma is usually considered in its gaseous form, solid bodies can also be
treated as plasma, denoted solid-state plasma. The first experimental proof of
wave effects in magnetized solid-state plasmas (Lundqvist, 1949, Herlofson,
1950) came after the suggestion by Alfv\'en (1942) on the possible existence of
magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) waves. However, most of our knowledge basis on
MHD/Alfv\'en waves have since then emerged from space- and laboratory (gaseous)
plasmas. It is therefore timely to investigate further the applicability of e/m
wave ponderomotive forcing on solid-state plasma. In this report we discuss the
applicability of the ponderomotive Miller force on solid-state plasmas. At this
stage the treatise will be rather qualitative, based on theories developed for
space plasma. We assume that e/m wave energy and momentum is transferred in a
thin surface layer constituting solid-state plasma. A Miller force results from
the wave pressure gradient set up in the surface layer. Since the solid body
constitute a coupled system (lattice), the Miller force will act on all atoms
in the body, the total force limited by the wave input power. A quantitative
comparison with experimental results obtained from a Cavendish vacuum
experiment (Lidgren and Lundin, 2010) gives a surprisingly good agreement
between theory and experiments. As further proof for e/m wave attraction of
matter, we show a simulation, taking into account the measured pendulum
offsets.

can estimate their contribution to pulsar timing observations; and showing that
much of the effect can be corrected making use of measured intensity and
dispersion. Finally, we analyze observations of the millisecond pulsar

When an intense laser pulse is launched into a highly nonlinear fiber, a stream
of fundamental solitons is generated, their temporal separations increasing
during propagation. This is due to the onset of a variety of perturbations,
including higher-order dispersion and the Raman effect. Recently, it has been
experimentally observed that the well-known law determining the amplitudes and
the temporal widths of each soliton, however, breaks down due to the unexpected
formation of metastable 2-peak localised states with constant temporal
separation between the two maxima. In the vicinity of certain 'magic' input
powers the formation of 2-peak states is quite common in many types of highly
nonlinear photonic crystal fibers. In this study, we provide a full theoretical
understanding of the above recent observations. Based on a 'gravity-like'
potential approach we derive simple equations for the 'magic' peak power ratio
and the temporal separation between pulses forming these 2-peak states. We
develop a model to calculate the magic input power of the input pulse around

Using both hydrostatic and hydrodynamic stellar evolution models with initial

be substantial, with stars losing a huge fraction of their H-envelope even with
a significantly lower initial mass than previously predicted. This might
explain the observed lack of Type II-P supernova progenitors having initial

luminosity and the kinetic power associated with the jet suggests that in this
source the accretion power dominates in agreement with the results obtained
from Radiation-MHD simulations of Galactic black holes (GBHs) accreting at the
Eddington rate. The combined findings from this panchromatic investigation
strongly suggest that PKS 0558-504 is a large-scale analog of GBHs in their
highly accreting intermediate state. Importantly, PKS 0558-504 may also be the
prototype of the parent population of the very radio-loud NLS1s recently
detected at gamma-ray energies.

stellar populations, in stark contrast to the conventional view that GCs are a
mono-metallic, coeval population of stars. Building on earlier work, we propose
a simple physical model for the early evolution (several 10^8 yr) of GCs. We
consider the effects of stellar mass-loss, type II and prompt type Ia
supernovae, ram pressure, and accretion from the ambient ISM on the development
of a young GC's own gas reservoir. In our model, type II SNe from a first
generation of star formation clears the GC of its initial gas reservoir. Over
the next several 10^8 yr, mass lost from AGB stars and matter accreted from the
ambient ISM collect at the center of the GC. This material must remain quite
cool (T~10^2K), but does not catastrophically cool on a crossing time because
of the high Lyman-Werner flux density in young GCs. The collection of gas
within the GC must compete with ram pressure from the ambient ISM. After
several 10^8 yr, the Lyman-Werner photon flux density drops by more than three
orders of magnitude, allowing molecular hydrogen and then stars to form. After
this second generation of star formation, type II SNe from the second
generation and then prompt type Ia SNe associated with the first generation
maintain a gas-free GC, thereby ending the cycle of star formation events. Our
model makes clear predictions for the presence or absence of multiple stellar
populations within GCs as a function of GC mass and formation environment.
Analyzing intermediate-age LMC clusters, we find evidence for a mass threshold
of ~10^4 Msun below which LMC clusters appear to be truly coeval. This
threshold mass is consistent with our predictions for the mass at which ram
pressure is capable of clearing gas from clusters in the LMC at the present
epoch. (ABRIDGED)

resolve fine structure in the spatial distribution and phase space of a dwarf
galaxy as it is disrupted in the tidal field of a Milky Way type galaxy. The
tidal tails exhibit nearly periodic clumping or a smoke-like appearance. By
running simulations with different satellite particle mass, halo particle mass,

have determined that the instabilities are not due to numerical noise,
amplification of structure in the halo, or shocking as the satellite passes
through the disk of the Galaxy. We measure Jeans wavelengths and growth
timescales in the tidal tail and show that the Jeans instability is a viable
explanation for the clumps. We find that the instability causes velocity
perturbations of order 10 km/s. Clumps in tidal tails present in the Milky Way
could be seen in stellar radial velocity surveys as well as number counts. We
find that the unstable wavelength growth is sensitive to the simulated mass of
dark matter halo particles. A simulation with a smoother halo exhibits colder

more massive dark matter halo particles. Heating by the halo particles
increases the Jeans wavelength in the tidal tail affecting substructure
development, suggesting an intricate connection between tidal tails and dark

mesons with ALICE via the hadronic decay of D0 and D* mesons. Heavy flavours,
produced at the The Large Hadron Collider, are excellent tools to investigate
the properties of the QCD medium produced in heavy-ion collisions. Baseline
measurements of heavy flavour production mechanisms in pp collisions are
necessary in order to understand the production in the medium as well as medium
induced effects. The study shows that for one year of data taking we will be
able to measure charmed mesons with very large significances (78 for D0 and 33
for D?). Both yields allow a measurement in one month of data taking (about 100
million events) with a D? significance of 10. The reconstruction of the charged
mesons is more difficult than for the neutral mesons due to kinematic
constraints on the soft pion in case of the D* decay. Most of these pions have
momenta lower than 0.4 GeV/c which makes them difficult to detect and therefore
the reconstruction efficiency is very low. However, by using the ALICE Inner
Tracking System as a standalone detector, the reconstruction efficiencies for
kaons and pions at very low momenta are improved. Due to selection criteria
imposed on the tracks the overall efficiency increase for the D* with the
ITS-standalone procedure is reported to be 7%. Note that after applying the
cuts on the D mesons, the contamination with D0 from beauty decays becomes
slightly larger (10%). For analyses where high efficiency is preferred over
high purity, the cuts on the D* and D0 can be loosened in order to have as many
particles as possible. In this case, a review of the contamination from B
decays is needed.

process is still somewhat unclear, they seem to provide useful laboratories to
study the very early stages of clustered star formation. Infrared dark clouds
have been identified predominantly toward the bright inner parts of the
galactic plane. The low background emission makes it more difficult to identify
similar objects in mid-infrared absorption in the outer parts. This is
unfortunate, because the outer Galaxy represents the only nearby region where
we can study effects of different (external) conditions on the star formation
process. The aim of this paper is to identify extended red regions in the outer
galactic plane based on reddening of stars in the near-infrared. We argue that
these regions appear reddened mainly due to extinction caused by molecular
clouds and young stellar objects. The work presented here is used as a basis
for identifying star forming regions and in particular the very early stages.
We use the Mann-Whitney U-test, in combination with a friends-of-friends
algorithm, to identify extended reddened regions in the 2MASS all-sky JHK
survey. We process the data on a regular grid using two different resolutions,
60"" and 90"". The two resolutions have been chosen because the stellar surface
density varies between the crowded spiral arm regions and the sparsely
populated galactic anti-center region. We identify 1320 extended red regions at
the higher resolution and 1589 at the lower resolution run. The majority of
regions are associated with major molecular cloud complexes, supporting our
hypothesis that the reddening is mostly due to foreground clouds and embedded
objects.

The meaning of a species tree is made more complicated by the recent discovery
of the importance of hybridizations and lateral gene transfers. Hence it is
desirable to describe uniform well-defined procedures that yield a tree given a
network N. A useful tool toward this end is a connected surjective digraph
(CSD) map f from N to N' where N' is generally a much simpler network than N. A
set W of vertices in N is ""restricted"" if there is at most one vertex from
which there is an arc into W, thus yielding a bottleneck in N. A CSD map f from
N to N' is ""restricted"" if the inverse image of each vertex in N' is restricted
in N. This paper describes a uniform procedure that, given a network N, yields
a well-defined tree called the ""restricted tree"" of N. There is a restricted
CSD map from N to the restricted tree. Many relationships in the tree can be
proved to appear also in N.

clusters, with temperatures 0.6-4.8 keV, spanning the redshift range 0.05 to
1.05. Comparing the profiles with a standard beta-model motivated by studies of
low redshift groups, we find 54% of our systems to possess a central excess,
which we identify with a cuspy cool core. Fitting beta-model profiles, allowing
for blurring by the XMM point spread function, we investigate trends with both
temperature and redshift in the outer slope (beta) of the X-ray surface
brightness, and in the incidence of cuspy cores. Fits to individual cluster
profiles and to profiles stacked in bands of redshift and temperature indicate
that the incidence of cuspy cores does not decline at high redshifts, as has
been reported in rich clusters. Rather such cores become more prominent with
increasing redshift. Beta shows a positive correlation with both redshift and
temperature. Given the beta-T trend seen in local systems, we assume that
temperature is the primary driver for this trend. Our results then demonstrate
that this correlation is still present at z~0.3, where most of our clusters
reside.

hydrodynamical simulations which include Supernova feedback were performed in

feedback is a fundamental process in order to reproduce the observed trends in
the stellar Tully-Fisher relation. Simulated slow rotating systems tend to have
lower stellar masses than those predicted by the linear fit to the massive end
of the relation, consistently with observations. This feature is not present if
Supernova feedback is turned off. In the case of the baryonic Tully-Fisher
relation, we also detect a weaker tendency for smaller systems to lie below the
linear relation described by larger ones. This behaviour arises as a result of
the more efficient action of Supernovae in the regulation of the star formation
process and in the triggering of powerful galactic outflows in shallower
potential wells which may heat up and/or expel part of the gas reservoir.

sub-thermal excitation of CO already at J=2. For BzK-21000, a Large Velocity

0.92_{-0.19}^{+0.28}. This suggests that, on average, the gas in these galaxies
is thermalized up to J=2, has star-formation efficiencies of ~100 L_sun (K km

observed ammonia line widths are dominated by non-thermal motions, typically
found to be a few times the thermal sound speed expected for the derived
kinetic temperature. We calculate the mass for each source from the millimeter
flux assuming the sources are isothermal and find a mean isothermal mass within
a 120"" aperture of 230 +/- 180 solar masses. We find a total mass of 8,400
solar masses for all BGPS sources in the Gemini OB1 molecular cloud,
representing 6.5% of the cloud mass. By comparing the millimeter isothermal
mass to the virial mass within a radius equal to the mm source size calculated
from the ammonia line widths, we find a mean virial parameter (M_vir/M_iso) of
1.0 +/- 0.9 for the sample. We find mean values for the distributions of column
densities of 10^22 cm^-2 for H_2, and 3.0x10^14 cm^-2 for ammonia, giving a
mean ammonia abundance of 3.0x10^-8 relative to H_2. We find volume-averaged
densities on the order of 10^3-10^4 cm^-3. The sizes and densities suggest that

  On the other side, the Enterprise Information Systems (EIS) researchers and

defining any part of the system, perform the modeling of the system's
underlying business process. Therefore, it can be stated that, in the case of
EIS, functional requirements are obtained by identifying Use Cases from the
business process models.
  The aim of this paper is, in a narrower perspective, to propose the use of
Finite State Machines (FSM) to model business process and then connect them to
the BDD machinery, thus driving better quality for EIS. In a broader
perspective, this article aims to provoke a discussion on the mapping of the
various BPM notations, since there isn't a real standard for business process
modeling (Moller et al., 2007), to BDD.
  Firstly a historical perspective of the evolution of previous proposals from
which this one emerged will be presented, and then the reasons to change from
Model Driven Development (MDD) to BDD will be presented also in a historical

find that the truncation is a strong relevant operator with respect to the

point is described by a generalized homogeneous function (GHF) of two variables
$\tau=\alpha-\alpha_{c}$ and $x=1/N_{b}$. The universal function has a
double-power form and the powers are obtained analytically as well as

planetesimal formation because of its ability to concentrate solids into dense

to gas mass ratio Z in protoplanetary disks (PPDs). In this letter, we show
that the magnitude of the radial pressure gradient (RPG) which drives the SI
(characterized by $q\equiv{\eta}v_K/c_s$, where ${\eta}v_K$ is the reduction of
Keplerian velocity due to the RPG and $c_s$ is the sound speed) also strongly
affects clumping. We present local two-dimensional hybrid numerical simulations
of aerodynamically coupled particles and gas in the midplane of PPDs. Magnetic
fields and particle self-gravity are ignored. We explore three different RPG
values appropriate for typical PPDs: $q=0.025, 0.05$ and 0.1. For each $q$
value, we consider four different particle size distributions ranging from sub
millimeter to meter sizes and run simulations with solid abundance from Z=0.01
up to Z=0.07. We find that a small RPG strongly promotes particle clumping in
that: 1) At fixed particle size distribution, the critical solid abundance
$Z_{\rm crit}$ above which particle clumping occurs monotonically increases
with $q$; 2) At fixed Z, strong clumping can occur for smaller particles when
$q$ is smaller. Therefore, we expect planetesimals to form preferentially in
regions of PPDs with a small RPG.

Particles with tau_s>=0.01 actively participate in the streaming instability,
generate turbulence and maintain the height of the particle layer before
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability is triggered. 2. Strong particle clumping as a
consequence of the streaming instability occurs when a substantial fraction of
the solids are large (tau_s>=0.01) and when height-integrated solid to gas mass
ratio Z is super-solar. 3. The radial drift velocity is reduced relative to the
conventional Nakagawa-Sekiya-Hayashi (NSH) model, especially at high Z. We
derive a generalized NSH equilibrium solution for multiple particle species
which fits our results very well. 4. Collision velocity between particles with
tau_s>=0.01 is dominated by differential radial drift, and is strongly reduced
at larger Z. 5. There exist two positive feedback loops with respect to the
enrichment of local disk solid abundance and grain growth. All these effects
promote planetesimal formation.

Mass Function (SMF), SFR functions and the cosmic star formation rate density
with simple backward evolutionary models. Starting from observed SMF for
star-forming galaxies, we use backwards models to predict the evolution of a
number of quantities, such as the SFR function, the cosmic SFR density and the
Velocity Function. The velocity being a parameter attached to a galaxy during
its history (contrary to the stellar mass), this approach allows us to quantify
the number density evolution of galaxies of a given velocity, e.g. of the Milky
Way siblings. Observations suggest that the SMF of star forming galaxies is
constant between redshift 0 and 1. In order to reproduce this result, we must
quench star formation in a number of star forming galaxies. The SMF of these
quenched galaxies is consistent with available data concerning the increase in
the population of quiescent galaxies in the same redshift interval. The SMF of
quiescent galaxies is then mainly determined by the distribution of active
galaxies that must stop star formation, with a modest mass redistribution
during mergers. The cosmic SFR density, and the evolution of the SFR functions
are relatively well recovered, although they provide some clue for a small
evolution of the SMF of star forming galaxies at the lowest redshifts. We thus
consider that we have obtained in a simple way a relatively consistent picture
of the evolution of galaxies at intermediate redshifts. We note that if this
picture is correct, 50 percent of the Milky-Way sisters (galaxies with the same
velocity as our Galaxy, i.e. 220 km/s) have quenched their star formation since
redshift 1 (and an even larger fraction for larger velocities). We discuss the
processes that might be responsible for this transformation.

We use magnetoconvection simulations of the solar surface to synthesize

brought about by the ME approximation. We also investigate the quality of the

parameters derived from ME inversions of high-spatial resolution profiles are
reasonably accurate and can be used for statistical analyses of solar magnetic
fields, even if the fit is not always good. We also show that the ME inferences
cannot be assigned to a specific atmospheric layer: different parameters sample
different ranges of optical depths, and even the same parameter may trace
different layers depending on the physical conditions of the atmosphere.
Despite this variability, ME inversions tend to probe deeper layers in granules

semi-infinite leads connected together by a coupling that is harmonically
modulated in time. The modulation is driven by an external agent that can
absorb and emit energy. We determine the energy current flowing out of the
leads exactly by solving numerically the Dyson equation for the contour-ordered
Green's function. The amplitude of the modulated coupling is of the same order
as the interparticle coupling within each lead. When the leads have the same
temperature, our numerical results show that modulating the coupling between
the leads may direct energy to either flow into the leads simultaneously or
flow out of the leads simultaneously, depending on the values of the driving
frequency and temperature. A special combination of values of the driving
frequency and temperature exists wherein no net energy flows into or out of the
leads, even for long times. When one of the leads is warmer than the other, net
energy flows out of the warmer lead. For the cooler lead, however, the
direction of the energy current flow depends on the values of the driving
frequency and temperature. In addition, we find transient effects to become
more pronounced for higher values of the driving frequency.

Based on analytical results for simplified configurations, and relying on
numerical studies for general scenarios, it is shown that a remarkable
inversion of the current flow in a surface layer may be predicted under a wide
set of experimental conditions. Strongly inhomogeneous current density
profiles, characterized by enhanced transport toward the center and reduced, or
even negative, values at the periphery of the conductor, are expected when the
physical mechanisms of flux depinning and consumption (via line cutting) are

stable for our longer-ranged potential. At low temperatures and pressures, the
fluid freezes into a body-centred-cubic solid that can be viewed as two
interpenetrating diamond lattices with a weak interaction between the two
sublattices. Upon compression, an orientationally ordered face-centred-cubic
crystal becomes more stable than the body-centred-cubic crystal, and at higher
temperatures a plastic face-centered-cubic phase is stabilized by the increased
entropy due to orientational disorder. A similar phase diagram is found for the
shorter-ranged potential, but at low temperatures and pressures, we also find a
region over which the diamond phase is thermodynamically favored over the
body-centred-cubic phase. The higher vibrational entropy of the diamond
structure with respect to the body-centred-cubic solid explains why it is
stable even though the enthalpy of the latter phase is lower. Some preliminary
studies on the growth of the diamond structure starting from a crystal seed
were performed. Even though the diamond phase is never thermodynamically stable
for the longer-ranged model, direct coexistence simulations of the interface
between the fluid and the body-centred-cubic crystal and between the fluid and

probable that in both cases the solid grows into a diamond crystal, albeit
involving some defects. These results highlight the importance of kinetic

function $f$ in the presence of an adversary which can corrupt up till $t$
parties. Almost all the works that have appeared in the literature so far
assume the presence of authenticated channels between the parties. This
assumption is far from realistic. Two directions of research have been borne
from relaxing this (strong) assumption: (a) The adversary is virtually
omnipotent and can control all the communication channels in the network, (b)
Only a partially connected topology of authenticated channels is guaranteed and
adversary controls a subset of the communication channels in the network.
  This work introduces a new setting for (unconditional) secure multiparty
computation problem which is an interesting intermediate model with respect to
the above well studied models from the literature (by sharing a salient feature
from both the above models). We consider the problem of (unconditional) secure
multi-party computation when 'some' of the communication channels connecting
the parties can be corrupted passively as well as actively. For this setting,
some honest parties may be connected to several other honest parties via
corrupted channels and may not be able to authentically communicate with them.
Such parties may not be assured the canonical guarantees of correctness or
privacy. We present refined definitions of security for this new intermediate
model of unconditional multiparty computation. We show how to adapt protocols
for (Unconditional) secure multiparty computation to realize the definitions
and also argue the tightness of the results achieved by us.

downward by a factor of ~2 relative to previous work, based on the
line-of-sight velocity distribution of ~2400 blue horizontal-branch (BHB) halo
stars. The observations were interpreted in a statistical approach using
cosmological galaxy formation simulations, as only four of the 6D phase-space
coordinates were determined. Here we concentrate on a close investigation of
the stars with highest negative radial velocity from that sample. For one star,
SDSSJ153935.67+023909.8 (J1539+0239 for short), we succeed in measuring a
significant proper motion, i.e. full phase-space information is obtained. We
confirm the star to be a Population II BHB star from an independent
quantitative analysis of the SDSS spectrum - providing the first NLTE study of
any halo BHB star - and reconstruct its 3D trajectory in the Galactic
potential. J1539+0239 turns out as the fastest halo star known to date, with a
Galactic rest-frame velocity of 694$^{+300}_{-221}$ km/s (full uncertainty
range from Monte Carlo error propagation) at its current position. The extreme
kinematics of the star allows a significant lower limit to be put on the halo
mass in order to keep it bound, of M_halo$\ge1.7_{-1.1}^{+2.3}\times10^{12}$

strongly disordered one-dimensional chain of coupled weakly anharmonic
classical oscillators. It is argued that chaos in this system has a very
particular spatial structure: it can be viewed as a dilute gas of chaotic
spots. Each chaotic spot corresponds to a stochastic pump which drives the
Arnold diffusion of the oscillators surrounding it, thus leading to their
relaxation and thermalization. The most important mechanism of relaxation at
long distances is provided by random migration of the chaotic spots along the
chain, which bears analogy with variable-range hopping of electrons in strongly

receivers. We use these observations to determine the telescope beam size, beam
shape and overall telescope beam efficiency as a function of frequency. We find
that the beam size is well fit by $\lambda$/$D$ over the frequency range with a
correlation coefficient of ~90%. We determine the telescope main beam
efficiencies are between ~48-64% for the 12-mm receiver and reasonably flat at
~50% for the 7-mm receiver. Beam maps of strong H$_2$O (22 GHz) and SiO masers
(43 GHz) provide a means to examine the radial beam pattern of the telescope.
At both frequencies the radial beam pattern reveals the presence of three
components, a central `core', which is well fit by a Gaussian and constitutes
the telescopes main beam, and inner and outer error beams. At both frequencies
the inner and outer error beams extend out to approximately 2 and 3.4 times the
full-width half maximum of the main beam respectively. Sources with angular
sizes a factor of two or more larger than the telescope main beam will couple
to the main and error beams, and therefore the power contributed by the error
beams needs to be considered. From measurements of the radial beam power
pattern we estimate the amount of power contained in the inner and outer error
beams is of order one-fifth at 22 GHz rising slightly to one-third at 43 GHz.

'tau' are commonly used to characterize the strength of an earthquake
prediction method and the significance of prediction results. To evaluate
better the forecaster's skill, it has been recently suggested to use a new
characteristic, the gambling score R, which incorporates the difficulty of
guessing each target event by using different weights for different alarms. We
expand the class of R-characteristics and apply these to the analysis of
results of the M8 prediction algorithm. We show that the level of significance
'alfa' strongly depends (1) on the choice of weighting alarm parameters, (2) on
the partitioning of the entire alarm volume into component parts, and (3) on
the accuracy of the spatial rate of target events, m(dg). These tools are at
the disposal of the researcher and can affect the significance estimate in
either direction. All the R-statistics discussed here corroborate that the
prediction of 8.0<=M<8.5 events by the M8 method is nontrivial. However,
conclusions based on traditional characteristics (n,tau) are more reliable
owing to two circumstances: 'tau' is stable since it is based on relative
values of m(.), and the 'n' statistic enables constructing an upper estimate of
'alfa' taking into account the uncertainty of m(.).

solar photosphere are difficult to observe, because the Zeeman effect is
virtually blind to them. The Hanle effect, acting on the scattering
polarization in suitable lines, can in principle be used as a diagnostic for
these fields. However, the prediction that the majority of the weak, turbulent
field resides in intergranular lanes also poses significant challenges to
scattering polarization observations because high spatial resolution is usually
difficult to attain. We aim to measure the difference in scattering
polarization between granules and intergranules. We present the respective
center-to-limb variations, which may serve as input for future models. We
perform full Stokes filter polarimetry at different solar limb positions with
the CN band filter of the Hinode-SOT Broadband Filter Imager, which represents
the first scattering polarization observations with sufficient spatial
resolution to discern the granulation. Hinode-SOT offers unprecedented spatial
resolution in combination with high polarimetric sensitivity. The CN band is
known to have a significant scattering polarization signal, and is sensitive to
the Hanle effect. We extend the instrumental polarization calibration routine
to the observing wavelength, and correct for various systematic effects. The
scattering polarization for granules (i.e., regions brighter than the median
intensity of non-magnetic pixels) is significantly larger than for
intergranules. We derive that the intergranules (i.e., the remaining
non-magnetic pixels) exhibit (9.8 \pm 3.0)% less scattering polarization for
0.2<u<0.3, although systematic effects cannot be completely excluded. These
observations constrain MHD models in combination with (polarized) radiative
transfer in terms of CN band line formation, radiation anisotropy, and magnetic
fields.

machine (and relative URL addressing in the executed program set to refer to
the invoked URL) or it is performed server-side at the machine addressed by the

this question the redshifts and apparent magnitudes of type 1A supernovae are

The redshift is ascribed to the relativistic Doppler effect which gives the
recession velocity when the light was emitted; if this has not changed, the
distance reached and the luminosity follow immediately. This simple concept
fits the observations surprisingly well. It appears that the galaxies recede at
unchanging velocities, so on the largest scale there is no significant

which makes it as a complementary probe of dark energy to supernova Ia (SN Ia).
However, the calibration of GRBs is still a big challenge when they are used to
constrain cosmological models. Though, the absolute magnitude of GRBs is still
unknown, the slopes of GRBs correlations can be used as a useful constraint to
dark energy in a completely cosmological model independent way. In this paper,
we follow Wang's model-independent distance measurement method and calculate
their values by using 109 GRBs events via the so-called Amati relation. Then,
we use the obtained model-independent distances to constrain $\Lambda$CDM model

thermonuclear supernovae generally rely on the tracer particle method to obtain
isotopic information of the ejected material for a given supernova simulation.
We investigate how many tracer particles are required to determine converged
integrated total nucleosynthetic yields. For this purpose, we conduct a
resolution study in the number of tracer particles for different hydrodynamical
explosion models at fixed spatial resolution. We perform hydrodynamic
simulations on a co-expanding Eulerian grid in two dimensions assuming
rotational symmetry for both pure deflagration and delayed detonation Type Ia
supernova explosions. Within a given explosion model, we vary the number of
tracer particles to determine the minimum needed for the method to give a
robust prediction of the integrated yields of the most abundant nuclides. For
the first time, we relax the usual assumption of constant tracer particle mass
and introduce a radially vary- ing distribution of tracer particle masses. We
find that the nucleosynthetic yields of the most abundant species (mass
fraction > 10E-5) are reasonably well predicted for a tracer number as small as
32 per axis and direction - more or less independent of the explosion model. We
conclude that the number of tracer particles that were used in extant published
works appear to have been sufficient as far as integrated yields are concerned
for the most copiously produced nuclides. Additionally we find that a suitably
chosen tracer mass distribution can improve convergence for nuclei produced in
the outer layer of the supernova where the constant tracer mass prescription
suffers from poor spatial resolution.

estimated as 15% for the photometer and between 15 and 50% for the

spectra of low flux sources in the longest wavelength part of the SPIRE
spectrometer band. The spectrometer wavelength accuracy is determined to be
better than 1/10th of the line FWHM. The astrometric accuracy in SPIRE maps is
found to be 2 arcsec when the latest calibration data are used. The photometric
calibration of the SPIRE instrument is currently determined by a combination of
uncertainties in the model spectra of the astronomical standards and the data
processing methods employed for map and spectrum calibration. Improvements in
processing techniques and a better understanding of the instrument performance
will lead to the final calibration accuracy of SPIRE being determined only by

internal cycle of the compactification manifold. A realistic model of inflation
must explain the tiny perturbations in the cosmic microwave background
radiation and also how to excite the ordinary matter degrees of freedom after
inflation, required for the success of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. We study these
issues focusing on two promising inflationary models embedded in LARGE volume
type IIB flux compactifications. We show that phenomenological requirements and
consistency of the effective field theory treatment imply the presence at low
energies of a hidden sector together with a visible sector, where the Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model fields are residing. A detailed calculation of
the inflaton coupling to the fields of the hidden sector, visible sector, and
moduli sector, reveals that the inflaton fails to excite primarily the visible
sector fields, instead hidden sector fields are excited copiously after the end
of inflation. This sets severe constraints on hidden sector model building
where the most promising scenario emerges as a pure N=1 SYM theory, forbidding
the kinematical decay of the inflaton to the hidden sector. In this case it is
possible to reheat the Universe with the visible degrees of freedom even though
in some cases we discover a new tension between TeV scale SUSY and reheating on
top of the well-known tension between TeV scale SUSY and inflation.

portfolio which weights are regularised by such norms is called a sparse
portfolio (Brodie et al.), since these constraints facilitate sparsity (zero

weights are regularised by a weighted $l_{1}$ and squared $l_{2}$ norm. Then
two benchmark data sets (Fama and French 48 industries and 100 size and BM

When the sample size is not relatively large to the number of assets, sparse
portfolios tend to have lower out-of-sample portfolio variances, turnover
rates, active assets, short-sale positions, but higher Sharpe ratios than the
unregularised MVP. We then show some possible extensions; particularly we
derive an efficient algorithm for solving an MVP problem in which assets are
allowed to be chosen grouply.

classifier and a Multilayer Radial Basis Functions Network (RBFN) were
optimized in a 10-fold cross-validation for each texture vector, and the
classification accuracy was calculated on independent test sets as a
quantitative measure of automated tissue characterization. A Wilcoxon
signed-rank test was used to compare two accuracy distributions and the
significance thresholds were adjusted for multiple comparisons by the
Bonferroni correction. The best classification results were obtained by the MF
features, which performed significantly better than all the standard GLCM and
MD features (p < 0.005) for both classifiers. The highest accuracy was found
for MF.euler (97.5%, 96.6%; for the k-NN and RBFN classifier, respectively).
The best standard texture features were the GLCM features 'homogeneity' (91.8%,
87.2%) and 'absolute value' (90.2%, 88.5%). The results indicate that advanced

computer-assisted diagnosis of interstitial lung diseases when compared to

characteristics can be determined, as most exoplanets are detected indirectly.
Measuring the astrometric signal of a planet by measuring the wobble of the
host star yields the full set of orbital parameters. With this information the
true masses of the planet candidates can be determined, making it possible to
establish the candidates as real planets, brown dwarfs (BD) or low mass stars.
In the context of this thesis, an M-dwarf with a BD candidate companion,
discovered by radial velocity measurements, was observed within a monitoring
program to detect the astrometric signal. Ground based adaptive optics aided
imaging with ESO/NACO was used to establish its true nature (BD vs. star) and
to investigate the prospects of this technique for exoplanet detection. The
astrometric corrections necessary to perform high precision astrometry are
described and their contribution to the overall precision is investigated. Due
to large uncertainties in the pixel-scale and the orientation of the detector,
no detection of the astrometric orbit signal was possible. The image quality of
ground-based telescopes is limited by the turbulence in Earth's atmosphere. The
induced distortions of the light can be measured and corrected with the
adaptive optics technique. However, the correction is only useful within a
small angle around the guide star. The novel correction technique of multi
conjugated adaptive optics uses several guide stars to correct a larger field
of view. The VLT/MAD instrument was built to demonstrate this technique.
Observations with MAD are analyzed in terms of astrometric precision in this
work. Two sets of data are compared, which were obtained in different
correction modes: pure ground layer correction and full multi conjugated

obtain state-of-the-art MD results. We observe an extended period of temporally
linear growth in the viscous hydrodynamic regime. The morphological similarity
of coarsening in fluids and solids is also quantified. The velocity field is
characterized by the presence of monopole-like defects, which yield a
generalized Porod tail in the corresponding structure factor.

many-particle systems that are not in equilibrium. We focus mainly on the
nonequilibrium generalizations of the flow equation approach and of dynamical
mean-field theory (DMFT). In the nonequilibrium flow equation approach one
first diagonalizes the Hamiltonian iteratively, performs the time evolution in
this diagonal basis, and then transforms back to the original basis, thereby
avoiding a direct perturbation expansion with errors that grow linearly in
time. In nonequilibrium DMFT, on the other hand, the Hubbard model can be
mapped onto a time-dependent self-consistent single-site problem. We discuss
results from the flow equation approach for nonlinear transport in the Kondo
model, and further applications of this method to the relaxation behavior in
the ferromagnetic Kondo model and the Hubbard model after an interaction
quench. For the interaction quench in the Hubbard model, we have also obtained
numerical DMFT results using quantum Monte Carlo simulations. In agreement with
the flow equation approach they show that for weak coupling the system relaxes
to a ""prethermalized"" intermediate state instead of rapid thermalization. We
discuss the description of nonthermal steady states with generalized Gibbs
ensembles.

of its system's habitable zone, which has led to much speculation on its
possible climate. We have performed a range of simulations to assess whether,
given simple combinations of chemically stable greenhouse gases, the planet
could sustain liquid water on its surface. For best estimates of the surface
gravity, surface albedo and cloud coverage, we find that less than 10 bars of
CO2 is sufficient to maintain a global mean temperature above the melting point
of water. Furthermore, even with the most conservative choices of these
parameters, we calculate temperatures above the water melting point for CO2
partial pressures greater than about 40 bar. However, we note that as Gl581d is
probably in a tidally resonant orbit, further simulations in 3D are required to
test whether such atmospheric conditions are stable against the collapse of CO2
on the surface.

  Matter Physics, Athens, GA",,,,"cond-mat.soft cond-mat.stat-mech","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many small proteins fold via a first-order ""all-or-none"" transition directly
from an expanded coil to a compact native state. Here we study an analogous
direct freezing transition from an expanded coil to a compact crystallite for a
simple flexible homopolymer. Wang-Landau sampling is used to construct the 1D
density of states for square-well chains of length 128. Analysis within both
the micro-canonical and canonical ensembles shows that, for a chain with
sufficiently short-range interactions, the usual polymer collapse transition is
preempted by a direct freezing or ""folding"" transition. A 2D free-energy
landscape, built via subsequent multi-canonical sampling, reveals a dominant
folding pathway over a single free-energy barrier. This barrier separates a
high entropy ensemble of unfolded states from a low entropy set of crystallite
states and the transition proceeds via the formation of a transition-state
folding nucleus. Despite the non-unique homopolymer ground state, the
thermodynamics of this direct freezing transition are identical to the
thermodynamics of two-state protein folding. The model chain satisfies the
van't Hoff calorimetric criterion for two-state folding and an Arrhenius
analysis of the folding/unfolding free energy barrier yields a Chevron plot
characteristic of small proteins.

differential rotation in the solar convection zone. The mathematical technique
relies on the assumption that entropy is nearly constant (""well-mixed"") in
isorotation surfaces both outside and within the tachocline. The resulting
solutions exhibit nontrivial features that strikingly resemble the true
tachocline isorotation contours in unexpected detail. This strengthens the
mathematical premises of the theory. The observed rotation pattern in the
tachocline shows strong quadrupolar structure, an important feature that is
explicitly used in constructing our solutions. The tachocline is treated
locally as an interior boundary layer of small but finite thickness, and an
explicit global solution is then constructed. A dynamical link can thus be
established between the internal jump in the angular velocity at the tachocline
and the spread of angular velocities observed near the solar surface. In
general, our results suggest that the bulk of the solar convection zone is in
thermal wind balance, and that simple quadrupolar stresses, local in radius,
mediate the tachocline transition from differential rotation to uniform
rotation in the radiative interior.

complementing the description of the density operator by the Wigner function,
have been defined by applying the Weyl-Wigner transform to dyadic operators,
linear in the state vector and anti-linear in a fixed `window state vector'.
Here aspects of this construction are explored, with emphasis on the connection
with Gabor's `windowed Fourier transform'. The amplitudes that arise for simple
quantum states from various choices of window are presented as illustrations.
Generalized Bargmann representations of the state vector appear as special
cases, associated with Gaussian windows. For every choice of window, amplitudes
lie in a corresponding linear subspace of square-integrable functions on phase
space. A generalized Born interpretation of amplitudes is described, with both
the Wigner function and a generalized Husimi function appearing as quantities
linear in an amplitude and anti-linear in its complex conjugate.
Schr\""odinger's time-dependent and time-independent equations are represented
on phase space amplitudes, and their solutions described in simple cases.
