realized in the Hubbard model, we study the mean-field phase diagram in the
$J_1-J_2$ spin-1/2 model and find an s-wave pairing state. We argue that s-wave
pairing state is not a stable phase and the true ground state may be SPS. A
scenario of a continuous phase transition from SPS to the semimetal phase is
proposed. This work also provides guideline for future variational studies of
Gutzwiller projected wavefunctions.

We perform fully consistent simulations for a class of coupled scalar field
models with an inverse power-law potential and negative coupling constant, for
which the chameleon mechanism does not operate. We find that in such
cosmological models the scalar-field potential plays a negligible role except
in the background expansion, and the fifth force that is produced is
proportional to gravity in magnitude, justifying the use of a rescaled
gravitational constant G in some earlier N-body simulations of similar models.
We study the effects of the scalar coupling on the nonlinear matter power
spectra and compare with linear perturbation calculations to investigate where
the nonlinear model deviates from the linear approximation. For the first time,
the algorithm to identify gravitationally virialized matter halos is adapted to
the scalar field cosmology, and then used to measure the mass function and
study the properties of virialized halos. We find that the net effect of the
scalar coupling helps produce more heavy halos in our simulation boxes and
suppresses the inner (but not the outer) density profile of halos compared with
those predicted by lambda-CDM, while this suppression weakens as the coupling
between the scalar field and dark matter particles increases in strength.

low-gain antennas operating at frequencies below 300 MHz. In this frequency
regime, Galactic noise can be a significant or dominant contribution to the
total noise. This, combined with mutual coupling between antennas, makes it
difficult to predict the sensitivity of these instruments. This paper describes
a system model and procedure for estimating the system equivalent flux density
(SEFD) - a useful and meaningful metric of the sensitivity of a radio telescope
- that accounts for these issues. The method is applied to LWA-1, the first
""station"" of the Long Wavelength Array (LWA) interferometer. LWA-1 consists of
512 bowtie-type antennas within a 110 x 100 m elliptical footprint, and is
designed to operate between 10 MHz and 88 MHz using receivers having noise
temperature of about 250 K. It is shown that the correlation of Galactic noise
between antennas significantly desensitizes the array for beam pointings which
are not close to the zenith. It is also shown that considerable improvement is
possible using beamforming coefficients which are designed to optimize
signal-to-noise ratio under these conditions. Mutual coupling is found to play
a significant role, but does not have a consistently positive or negative
influence. In particular, we demonstrate that pattern multiplication (assuming
the behavior of single antennas embedded in the array is the same as those same
antennas by themselves) does not generate reliable estimates of SEFD.

two-third pulses in our sample) and $E_{\rm p}$-tracing-$F$ (the one-third
pulses in our sample) are observed in pulses from different GRBs and even from
different pulses of the same burst. No dependence of spectral evolution feature
on the pulse shape is found. A tight $F-E_{\rm p}$ positive correlation is
observed in the decaying phases, with a power-law index $\sim 2.2$, which is
much shallower than that expectation of the curvature effect. In the rising
phase, the observed $F$ is either correlated or anti-correlated with $E_{\rm
p}$, depending on the spectral evolution feature, and the power-law index of
the correlation is dramatically different among pulses. More than $80%$ of the
low energy photon indices in the time-resolved spectra whose $E_{\rm p}$ is
anti-correlated with $F$ during the rising phase violate the death line of the
synchrotron radiation, disfavoring the synchrotron radiation model for these
gamma-rays. The $F-E_{\rm p}$ correlation, especially for those GRBs with
$E_{\rm p}$-tracking-$F$ spectral evolution, may be due to the viewing angle
and jet structure effects. In this cenario, the observed $F-E_{\rm p}$
correlation in the rising phase may be due to the line of sight from off-beam
to on-beam toward a structured jet (or jitter), and the decaying phase is
contributed by both the on-beam emission and the decayed photons from high
latitude of the GRB fireball,resulting in a shallower slope of the observed
$F-E_{\rm p}$ correlation than that predicted by the pure curvature effect.

a system of hyperbolic balance laws with dual multiscale behavior (multiscale
behavior associated with the hyperbolic wave speeds as well as multiscale
behavior associated with source term relaxation). With this outlook in mind,
this paper presents a hybrid Godunov method for one-dimensional radiation
hydrodynamics that is uniformly well behaved from the photon free streaming
(hyperbolic) limit through the weak equilibrium diffusion (parabolic) limit and
to the strong equilibrium diffusion (hyperbolic) limit. Moreover, one finds
that the technique preserves certain asymptotic limits. The method incorporates
a backward Euler upwinding scheme for the radiation energy density and flux as
well as a modified Godunov scheme for the material density, momentum density,
and energy density. The backward Euler upwinding scheme is first-order accurate
and uses an implicit HLLE flux function to temporally advance the radiation
components according to the material flow scale. The modified Godunov scheme is
second-order accurate and directly couples stiff source term effects to the
hyperbolic structure of the system of balance laws. This Godunov technique is
composed of a predictor step that is based on Duhamel's principle and a
corrector step that is based on Picard iteration. The Godunov scheme is
explicit on the material flow scale but is unsplit and fully couples matter and
radiation without invoking a diffusion-type approximation for radiation
hydrodynamics. This technique derives from earlier work by Miniati & Colella
2007. Numerical tests demonstrate that the method is stable, robust, and
accurate across various parameter regimes.

is negative in the redshift range $0\le z\le 2$ at more than $3\sigma$ level.

the observed ISW signals are at odd with the concordant \Lambda cold dark

the CMB cold spot in the southern Galactic hemisphere filtered by a

implying that a quasi-linear supervoid or an underdensity region surrounded by
a massive wall may reside at low redshifts z<0.3 and the actual angular size

Using pressure-driven flow through a pore, the blockade rate for 100 nm
carboxylated polystyrene particles was found to be linearly proportional to
both transmembrane pressure (controlled between 0 and 1.8 kPa) and particle
concentration (between 7 x 10^8 and 4.5 x 10^10 mL^-1). This result can be
accurately modelled using Nernst-Planck transport theory. Using only an applied
potential across a pore, the blockade rates for carboxylic acid and amine
coated 500 nm and 200 nm silica particles were found to correspond to changes
in their mobility as a function of the solution pH. Scanning electron
microscopy and confocal microscopy have been used to visualise changes in the
tunable nanopore geometry in three dimensions as a function of applied
mechanical strain. The pores observed were conical in shape, and changes in
pore size were consistent with ionic current measurements. A zone of inelastic
deformation adjacent to the pore has been identified as critical in the tuning

To provide an indication various implementations are studied and summarized to
identify the different problems in existing applications. Clustering time
series is a trouble that has applications in an extensive assortment of fields
and has recently attracted a large amount of research. Time series data are
frequently large and may contain outliers. In addition, time series are a
special type of data set where elements have a temporal ordering. Therefore
clustering of such data stream is an important issue in the data mining
process. Numerous techniques and clustering algorithms have been proposed
earlier to assist clustering of time series data streams. The clustering
algorithms and its effectiveness on various applications are compared to
develop a new method to solve the existing problem. This paper presents a
survey on various clustering algorithms available for time series datasets.
Moreover, the distinctiveness and restriction of previous research are
discussed and several achievable topics for future study are recognized.
Furthermore the areas that utilize time series clustering are also summarized.

accomplished by minimizing a conventional penalized least-squares objective

another vertex $x$, has infinite mean. If the walker can restart the walk at
$x$ at will, then the minimum expected hitting time $T(x,0)$ (minimized over
restarting strategies) is finite; it was called the ``grade'' of $x$ by
Dumitriu, Tetali and Winkler. They showed that, in a more general setting, the
grade (a variant of the ``Gittins index'') plays a crucial role in control
problems involving several Markov chains. Here we establish several conjectures
of Dumitriu et al on the asymptotics of the grade in Euclidean lattices. In
particular, we show that in the planar square lattice, $T(x,0)$ is asymptotic
to $2|x|^2\log|x|$ as $|x| \to \infty$. The proof hinges on the local variance
of the potential kernel $h$ being almost constant on the level sets of $h$. We
also show how the same method yields precise second order asymptotics for
hitting times of a random walk (without restarts) in a lattice disk.

processing. It becomes more important whi le typically dealing with medical
images where presurgery and post surgery decisions are required for the purpose
of initiating and speeding up the recovery process. Segmentation of 3-D tumor
structures from magnetic resonance images (MRI) is a very challenging problem
due to the variability of tumor geometry and intensity patterns. Level set
evolution combining global smoothness with the flexibility of topology changes
offers significant advantages over the conventional statistical classification
followed by mathematical morphology. Level set evolution with constant
propagation needs to be initialized either completely inside or outside the
tumor and can leak through weak or missing boundary parts. Replacing the
constant propagation term by a statistical force overcomes these limitations
and results in a convergence to a stable solution. Using MR images presenting
tumors, probabilities for background and tumor regions are calculated from a
pre- and post-contrast difference image and mixture modeling fit of the
histogram. The whole image is used for initialization of the level set
evolution to segment the tumor boundaries.

effective confinement in this system, thus supressing the interfacial

interfacial width as compared to equilibrium. Pair correlations are more
suppressed in the vorticity direction y than in the driving direction; the
opposite holds for the structure factor. Lateral transport of capillary waves
occurs for those forms of F(z) for which the current j^x(z) is an odd function
of z, for example the shear-like drive, and a `step-like' driving field. For a

develop and demonstrate an approach based on ``distantly-labeling'' a data set

particular we build a dataset of more than a million people mentions extracted
from 3.5 years of New York Times articles, leverage Wikipedia for distant

labeling); then we train and evaluate a conditional random field coreference
model that has factors on cross-document entities as well as mention-pairs.
This coreference model obtains high accuracy in resolving mentions and entities

  lateral inhibition patterning",,,,,"q-bio.MN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Lateral inhibition patterns mediated by the Notch-Delta signaling system
occur in diverse developmental contexts. These systems are based on an
intercellular feedback loop in which Notch activation leads to down-regulation
of Delta. However, even in relatively well-characterized systems, the pathway
leading from Notch activation to Delta repression often remains elusive. Recent
work has shown that cis-interactions between Notch and Delta lead to mutual
inactivation of both proteins. Here we show that this type of cis-interaction
enables a simpler and more direct mechanism for lateral inhibition feedback
than those proposed previously. In this mechanism, Notch signaling directly
up-regulates Notch expression, thereby inactivating Delta through the mutual
inactivation of Notch and Delta proteins. This mechanism, which we term
Simplest Lateral Inhibition by Mutual Inactivation (SLIMI), can implement
patterning without requiring any additional genes or regulatory interactions.
Moreover, the key interaction of Notch expression in response to Notch
signaling has been observed in some systems. Stability analysis and simulation
of SLIMI mathematical models show that this lateral inhibition circuit is
capable of pattern formation across a broad range of parameter values. These
results provide a simple and plausible explanation for lateral inhibition
pattern formation during development.

the instabilities affecting the flame and present new results of application to
the turbulent regime. The acceleration of the flame, the possible transition to
the distributed regime and further deflagration-to-detonation mechanism are
addressed. As a general result, we conclude that the burning happens in (at
least) either the turbulent Rayleigh-Taylor or the distributed regime. In both
cases the velocity of the conversion of the star is several orders of magnitude
larger than vlam, making the latter irrelevant in practice for this problem. A
transition to a detonation is by no means excluded, actually it seems to be
favored by the physical setting, but a definitive answer would need a full

nonlinear normal modes (NNMs), i.e periodic solutions which represent
continuations of the system's linear normal modes in the nonlinear regime. We
examine the existence of such solutions and discuss different methods for
constructing them and studying their stability under fixed and periodic
boundary conditions. In the periodic case, we employ group theoretical concepts
to identify a special type of NNMs called one-dimensional ""bushes"". We describe
how to use linear combinations such NNMs to construct s(>1)-dimensional bushes
of quasiperiodic orbits, for a wide variety of Hamiltonian systems and exploit
the symmetries of the linearized equations to simplify the study of their
destabilization. Applying this theory to the Fermi Pasta Ulam (FPU) chain, we
review a number of interesting results, which have appeared in the recent
literature. We then turn to an analytical and numerical construction of
quasiperiodic orbits, which does not depend on the symmetries or boundary
conditions. We demonstrate that the well-known ""paradox"" of FPU recurrences may
be explained in terms of the exponential localization of the energies Eq of
NNM's excited at the low part of the frequency spectrum, i.e. q=1,2,3,....
Thus, we show that the stability of these low-dimensional manifolds called
q-tori is related to the persistence or FPU recurrences at low energies.
Finally, we discuss a novel approach to the stability of orbits of conservative
systems, the GALIk, k=2,...,2N, by means of which one can determine accurately
and efficiently the destabilization of q-tori, leading to the breakdown of
recurrences and the equipartition of energy, at high values of the total energy

transition from normal nuclear matter to a mixed phase of quark and nuclear

oscillate with time. However, they are nearly 180 degree out of phase.
Consequently, extremely intense, pulsating neutrino/antineutrino and leptonic

ejected from the stellar surface by the neutrinos and antineutrinos. These
ejecta can be further accelerated to relativistic speeds by the

outside the stellar surface. We suggest that this process may be a possible

dynamical balance among the competing species. The time-varying populations of
the interacting species are often captured rather well by a set of
deterministic replicator equations in the evolutionary game theory. However,
intrinsic fluctuations arisen from the discreteness of populations lead to
stochastic derivations from the smooth evolution trajectories. The role of
these fluctuations is shown to be critical at causing extinction and
deteriorating the biodiversity of ecosystem. We use children's
rock-paper-scissors game to demonstrate how the intrinsic fluctuations arise
from the discrete populations and why the biodiversity of the ecosystem decays
exponentially, disregarding the detail parameters for competing mechanism and
initial distributions. The dissipative trend in biodiversity can be analogized
to the gradual erosion of kinetic energy of a moving particle due to air drag
or fluid viscosity. The dissipation-fluctuation theorem in statistical physics
seals the fate of these originally conserved quantities. This concept in
physics can be generalized to scrutinize the errors that might be incurred in
the ecological, biological, and quantitative economic modeling for which the

sample of eclipsing binaries, which are representative of a whole dwarf and
metal-poor galaxy. We also aim at providing a new estimate of the mean distance
to the SMC and of its depth along the line of sight for the observed field of
view. Method: We use radial velocity curves obtained with the ESO FLAMES
facility at the VLT and light curves from the OGLE-II photometric survey. The
radial velocities were obtained by least-squares fits of the observed spectra
to synthetic ones, excluding the hydrogen Balmer lines. Results: Our sample
contains 23 detached, 9 semi-detached and 1 overcontact systems. Most detached
systems have properties consistent with stellar evolution calculations from
single-star models at the standard SMC metallicity Z = 0.004, though they tend
to be slightly overluminous. The few exceptions are probably due to third light
contribution or insufficient signal-to-noise ratio. The mass ratios are
consistent with a flat distribution, both for detached and
semi-detached/contact binaries. A mass-luminosity relation valid from ~4 to ~18
Msol is derived. The uncertainties are in the +-2 to +-11% range for the
masses, in the +-2 to +-5% range for the radii and in the +-1 to +-6% range for
the effective temperatures. The average distance modulus is 19.11+-0.03
(66.4+-0.9 kpc). The moduli derived from the V and from the I data are
consistent within 0.01 mag. The 2-sigma depth of the SMC is, for our field, of
0.25 mag or 7.6 kpc under the assumption of a gaussian distribution of stars
along the line of sight. Three systems show significant apsidal motion, one of
them with an apsidal period of 7.6 years, the shortest known to date for a
detached system with main sequence stars.

towards specific oscillatory targets than networks with ER topology for both
incoming and outgoing nodes. Similar results are found for networks with SFboth
and SFout topologies. The functionality of the SFout topology, which most
closely resembles the structure of biological gene networks (Babu et al.,
2004), is compared to the ER topology in further detail through an extension to
multiple target outputs, with either an oscillatory or a non-oscillatory
nature. For multiple oscillatory targets of the same length, the differences
between SFout and ER networks are enhanced, but for non-oscillatory targets
both types of networks show fairly similar evolvability. We find that SF
networks generate oscillations much more easily than ER networks do, and this
may explain why SF networks are more evolvable than ER networks are for
oscillatory phenotypes. In spite of their greater evolvability, we find that
networks with SFout topologies are also more robust to mutations than ER
networks. Furthermore, the SFout topologies are more robust to changes in
initial conditions (environmental robustness). For both topologies, we find
that once a population of networks has reached the target state, further
neutral evolution can lead to an increase in both the mutational robustness and
the environmental robustness to changes in initial conditions.

that gives no explicit derivative with a systematic differentiation theory
counterpart, as in elementary calculus. So, can we define a pathwise stochastic
derivative of semimartingales with respect to Brownian motion that leads to a
differentiation theory counterpart to It\^o's integral calculus? From It\^o's
definition of his integral, such a derivative must be based on the quadratic
covariation process. We give such a derivative in this note and we show that it
leads to a fundamental theorem of stochastic calculus, a generalized stochastic
chain rule that includes the case of convex functions acting on continuous
semimartingales, and the stochastic mean value and Rolle's theorems. In
addition, it interacts with basic algebraic operations on semimartingales
similarly to the way the deterministic derivative does on deterministic
functions, making it natural for computations. Such a differentiation theory
leads to many interesting applications some of which we address in an upcoming
article.

  731-755",,"Department of Statistics, the University of Michigan, Technical
  Report 462","stat.ME math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The extremal index parameter theta characterizes the degree of local
dependence in the extremes of a stationary time series and has important
applications in a number of areas, such as hydrology, telecommunications,
finance and environmental studies. In this study, a novel estimator for theta
based on the asymptotic scaling of block-maxima and resampling is introduced.
It is shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal for a large class of
m-dependent time series. Further, a procedure for the automatic selection of
its tuning parameter is developed and different types of confidence intervals
that prove useful in practice proposed. The performance of the estimator is
examined through simulations, which show its highly competitive behavior.
Finally, the estimator is applied to three real data sets of daily crude oil
prices, daily returns of the S&P 500 stock index, and high-frequency, intra-day
traded volumes of a stock. These applications demonstrate additional diagnostic
features of statistical plots based on the new estimator.

distribution of positive charge have been investigated by density functional
computations in the unrestricted local spin density approximation. Our
investigations have been focused on the low density regime, in which electrons
are localised. The results reveal a wide variety of different charge and spin
configurations, including linear and zig-zag chains, single and double-strand
helices, and twisted chains of dimers. The spin-spin coupling turns from weakly
anti-ferromagnetic at relatively high density, to weakly ferromagnetic at the
lowest densities considered in our computations. The stability of linear chains
of localised charge has been investigated by analysing the radial dependence of
the self-consistent potential and by computing the dispersion relation of
low-energy harmonic excitations.

GHz), may carry weak spectral distortions which are fingerprints of processes
occurred during different epochs of the thermal history of the Universe, from
z~3\times 10^6 to reionization. TRIS and ARCADE2 are the most recent
experiments dedicated to the exploration of this chapter of CMB cosmology. The
level of instrumental accuracy they reached in the determination of the
absolute sky temperature is such that the removal of galactic and
extra-galactic contamination is the true bottleneck towards the recovery of the
cosmological signal. This will be certainly the case also for future
experiments in the radio domain. Here we present an update of a study
originally done to recognize the contribution of unresolved extra-galactic
radio sources to the sky brightness measured by TRIS. Despite the specific
context which originated our analysis, this is a study of general interest,
improved by the inclusion of all the source counts available up-to-date from
150 MHz to 8.4 GHz.
