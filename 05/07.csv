quantum graphs. It has previously been conjectured that these should be
described by a Gaussian Random Wave Model, by analogy with quantum chaotic
systems, for which such a model was proposed by Berry in 1977. The
autocorrelation functions we calculate for an individual quantum graph exhibit
a universal component, which completely determines a Gaussian Random Wave
Model, and a system-dependent deviation. This deviation depends on the graph
only through its underlying classical dynamics. Classical criteria for quantum
universality to be met asymptotically in the large graph limit (i.e. for the
non-universal deviation to vanish) are then extracted. We use an exact field
theoretic expression in terms of a variant of a supersymmetric sigma model. A
saddle-point analysis of this expression leads to the estimates. In particular,
intensity correlations are used to discuss the possible equidistribution of the
energy eigenfunctions in the large graph limit. When equidistribution is
asymptotically realized, our theory predicts a rate of convergence that is a
significant refinement of previous estimates. The universal and
system-dependent components of intensity correlation functions are recovered by
means of an exact trace formula which we analyse in the diagonal approximation,
drawing in this way a parallel between the field theory and semiclassics. Our
results provide the first instance where an asymptotic Gaussian Random Wave
Model has been established microscopically for eigenfunctions in a system with
no disorder.

distribution are often assumed right from the beginning. Generalizing Theorem
4.2 of Huber[81], we show that in the class of smooth parametric group models
these densities are in fact consequences of a finite Fisher information of the
model, provided a suitable representation of the latter is used. The proof uses
the notions of absolute continuity in k dimensions and weak differentiability.
As examples to which this theorem applies, we spell out a number of models
including a correlation model and the general multivariate location and scale
model. As a consequence of this approach, we show that in the (multivariate)
location scale model, finiteness of Fisher information as defined here is in
fact equivalent to L_2-differentiability and to a log-likelihood expansion
giving local asymptotic normality of the model. Paralleling Huber's proofs for
existence and uniqueness of a minimizer of Fisher information to our situation,
we get existence of a minimizer in any weakly closed set of central
distributions F. If, additionally to analogue assumptions to those of
Huber[81], a certain identifiability condition for the transformation holds, we
obtain uniqueness of the minimizer. This identifiability condition is satisfied
in the multivariate location scale model.

generalizations of Lie algebras in a self-contained and unified way. These
generalizations are algebraic structures in which the two entries Lie bracket
has been replaced by a bracket with n entries. Each type of n-ary bracket
satisfies a specific characteristic identity which plays the r\^ole of the
Jacobi identity for Lie algebras. Particular attention will be paid to
generalized Lie algebras, which are defined by even multibrackets obtained by
antisymmetrizing the associative products of its n components and that satisfy
the generalized Jacobi identity (GJI), and to Filippov (or n-Lie) algebras,
which are defined by fully antisymmetric n-brackets that satisfy the Filippov
identity (FI). Three-Lie algebras have surfaced recently in multi-brane theory
in the context of the Bagger-Lambert-Gustavsson model. Because of this,
Filippov algebras will be discussed at length, including the cohomology
complexes that govern their central extensions and their deformations
(Whitehead's lemma extends to all semisimple n-Lie algebras). When the
skewsymmetry of the n-Lie algebra is relaxed, one is led the n-Leibniz
algebras. These will be discussed as well, since they underlie the
cohomological properties of n-Lie algebras.
  The standard Poisson structure may also be extended to the n-ary case. We
shall review here the even generalized Poisson structures, whose GJI reproduces
the pattern of the generalized Lie algebras, and the Nambu-Poisson structures,
which satisfy the FI and determine Filippov algebras. Finally, the recent work
of Bagger-Lambert and Gustavsson on superconformal Chern-Simons theory will be
briefly discussed. Emphasis will be made on the appearance of the 3-Lie algebra
structure and on why the A_4 model may be formulated in terms of an ordinary
Lie algebra, and on its Nambu bracket generalization.

this hydrodynamic model that enables a meaningful insight of the different

heat transport that produces a flow and back-flow process inside the

Nevertheless, our experimental results confirm that transport of elastic energy

liquid flow) in a liquid filled porous glass can be described according to

be realized in hardware, i.e. by a discrete physical system. The problem is
that up to now there is no programming language by which physical systems can
constructively be described. Such tool, however, is essential for the compact
description and automatic production of complex systems. This paper introduces
a programming language, called Akton-Algebra, which provides the foundation for
the complete description of discrete physical systems. The approach originates
from the finding that every discrete physical system reduces to a
spatiotemporal topological network of nodes, if the functional and metric
properties are deleted. A next finding is that there exists a homeomorphism
between the topological network and a sequence of symbols representing a
program by which the original nodal network can be reconstructed. Providing
Akton-Algebra with functionality turns it into a flow-controlled general data
processing language, which by introducing clock control and addressing can be
further transformed into a classical programming language. Providing
Akton-Algebra with metrics, i.e. the shape and size of the components, turns it
into a novel hardware system construction language.

gas and large scale kinematics. We detect and study the molecular gas in the
disc at spatial resolution from 7.7"" to 18.9"" using the APEX telescope. The
lines 12CO J=7-6, J=6-5, J=3-2, 13CO J=3-2 and [C I] 3P2-3P1 are observed,
diagnostic of disc temperature, size, chemistry, and kinematics. We use
parametric disc models that reproduce the low-J 12CO emission from Herbig~Ae
stars and vary the basic disc parameters - temperature, mass and size. Using
the molecular excitation and radiative transfer code RATRAN we fit the observed
spectral line profiles. Our observations are consistent with more than 0.001
Msun of molecular gas in a disc of approximately 400 AU radius in Keplerian
rotation around a 2.5 Msun star, seen at an inclination of 50 degrees. The
detected 12CO lines are dominated by gas at 30-70~K. The non-detection of the
[C I] line indicates excess ultraviolet emission above that of a B9 type model
stellar atmosphere. Asymmetry in the 12CO line emission suggests that one side
of the outer disc is colder by 10-20~K than the other, possibly due to a shadow
by a warped geometry of the inner disc. Pointing offsets, foreground cloud
absorption and asymmetry in the disc extent are excluded scenarios. Efficient
heating of the outer disc ensures that low- and high-J 12CO lines are dominated
by the outermost disc regions, indicating a 400 AU radius. The 12CO J=6--5 line
arises from a disc layer higher above disc midplane, and warmer by 15-20~K than
the layer emitting the J=3--2 line. The existing models of discs around Herbig
Ae stars, assuming a B9.5 type model stellar atmosphere overproduce the [CI]
3P2--3P1 line intensity from HD 100546 by an order of magnitude.

seems very likely that the highest energy emission is from the forward-shock
energizing the ambient medium (the standard blast-wave model for GRB
afterglows), the GeV flux and its decay rate being consistent with that model's
expectations. However, the synchrotron emission from a collimated outflow (the
standard jet model) has difficulties in accounting for the lower-energy
afterglow emission, where a simultaneous break occurs at 2 ks in the optical

from same spectral component as the lower-energy afterglow emission, which
suggests a synchrotron self-Compton model for this afterglow. Cessation of

existence of low temperature equilibrium states of Gibbs form is related to
questions on the existence of topological invariants of embedded graphs and

investigated. A classical simple fluid with a locally introduced field
simulating a solid is considered. For the case of a hard-core field, rigid,
exponential, realistic, and macroscopically smooth boundaries are examined.
  Two approaches to this problem are analyzed. With some degree of
arbitrariness, they can be referred to as ""adsorption"" vs ""surface tension"" or
""cluster expansion"" vs ""pressure tensor"".
  The ""adsorption"" approach is used to obtain a series in powers of the
activity for gamma. For Mayer-type expansion the integrals of the Ursell
functions contain factors which depend on the particle/wall interaction
potential. In the case of a hard wall, the coefficients of the series reduce to
the first moments of the Ursell functions taken over certain regions.
  The ""surface tension"" approach is used to expand the Kirkwood-Buff formula
for gamma to the arbitrary localization of the dividing surface. ""The surface
tension coefficient"" breaks up into the term proportional to the Henry
constant, depending on the dividing surface position, and universal nonlinear
surface coefficient.
  It is shown that the derivative of the tangential component of the pressure
tensor with respect to the chemical potential coincides with the near-surface
number density on average over the transition region, that has two
consequences.
  Firstly, it proves complete identity between ""tension"" and ""adsorption""
approaches in the domain of their existence.
  Secondly, it gives the near-surface virial expansion, which determines the
exact equation of state of near boundary ""two-dimensional"" fluid. The
tangential component of the pressure tensor averaged over the transition region
plays the role of pressure, and the average number density - the role of number
density.

complete revolution in recent years thanks to the discovery of the first
afterglows and host galaxies in May 2005. These observations demonstrated that
short GRBs are cosmological in origin, reside in both star forming and
elliptical galaxies, are not associated with supernovae, and span a wide
isotropic-equivalent energy range of ~10^48-10^52 erg. However, a fundamental
question remains unanswered: What are the progenitors of short GRBs? The most
popular theoretical model invokes the coalescence of compact object binaries
with neutron star and/or black hole constituents. However, additional
possibilities exist, including magnetars formed through prompt channels
(massive star core-collapse) and delayed channels (binary white dwarf mergers,
white dwarf accretion-induced collapse), or accretion-induced collapse of
neutron stars. In this review I summarize our current knowledge of the galactic
and sub-galactic environments of short GRBs, and use these observations to draw
inferences about the progenitor population. The most crucial results are: (i)
some short GRBs explode in dead elliptical galaxies; (ii) the majority of short
GRBs occur in star forming galaxies; (iii) the star forming hosts of short GRBs
are distinct from those of long GRBs (lower star formation rates, and higher
luminosities and metallicities), and instead appear to be drawn from the
general field galaxy population; (iv) the physical offsets of short GRBs
relative to their host galaxy centers are significantly larger than for long
GRBs; (v) the observed offset distribution is in good agreement with
predictions for NS-NS binary mergers; and (vi) short GRBs trace under-luminous
locations within their hosts, but appear to be more closely correlated with the
rest-frame optical light (old stars) than the UV light (young massive stars).

that it has an intrinsic rest-frame 8-1000um luminosity, L(bol), of (2.3 +/-
0.2) x 10^12 L(sun) and a likely SFR of ~400 M(sun)/yr. The galaxy sits on the
far-IR/radio correlation for far-IR-selected galaxies. At ~>70um, the SED can
be described adequately by dust components with T(d) ~ 30 and 60K. Using
SPIRE's Fourier Transform Spectrometer we report a detection of the [CII] 158um
cooling line. If the [CII], CO and far-IR continuum arise in photo-dissociation
regions, we derive a characteristic gas density, n ~ 10^3 cm^-3, and a far-UV
radiation field, G_0, 10^3x stronger than the Milky Way. L([CII])/L(bol) is
significantly higher than in local ULIRGs but similar to the values found in
local star-forming galaxies and starburst nuclei. This is consistent with SMM
J2135-0102 being powered by starburst clumps distributed across ~2 kpc,
evidence that SMGs are not simply scaled-up ULIRGs. Our results show that
SPIRE's FTS has the ability to measure the redshifts of distant, obscured
galaxies via the blind detection of atomic cooling lines, but it will not be
competitive with ground-based CO-line searches. It will, however, allow
detailed study of the integrated properties of high-redshift galaxies, as well

radio wavelengths, to search for signs that the ratio evolves with redshift,
luminosity or dust temperature, and to identify any far-IR-bright outliers -
useful laboratories for exploring why the far-IR/radio correlation is generally
so tight when the prevailing theory suggests variations are almost inevitable.
We use flux-limited 250-um and 1.4-GHz samples, obtained in GOODS-N using
Herschel (HerMES; PEP) and the VLA. We determine bolometric IR output using ten
bands spanning 24-1250um, exploiting data from PACS and SPIRE, as well as
Spitzer, SCUBA, AzTEC and MAMBO. We also explore the properties of an
L(IR)-matched sample, designed to reveal evolution of q(IR) with z, spanning
log L(IR) = 11-12 L(sun) and z=0-2, by stacking into the radio and far-IR
images. For 1.4-GHz-selected galaxies, we see tentative evidence of a break in
the flux ratio, q(IR), at L(1.4GHz) ~ 10^22.7 W/Hz, where AGN are starting to
dominate the radio power density, and of weaker correlations with z and T(d).
From our 250-um-selected sample we identify a small number of far-IR-bright
outliers, and see trends of q(IR) with L(1.4GHz), L(IR), T(d) and z, noting
that some of these are inter-related. For our L(IR)-matched sample, there is no
evidence that q(IR) changes significantly as we move back into the epoch of
galaxy formation: we find q(IR) goes as (1+z)^gamma, where gamma = -0.04 +/-
0.03 at z=0-2; however, discounting the least reliable data at z<0.5 we find
gamma = -0.26 +/- 0.07, modest evolution which may be related to the radio
background seen by ARCADE2, perhaps driven by <10uJy radio activity amongst
ordinary star-forming galaxies at z>1.

evolution. The accuracy of SFR measurements at z~2 has been questioned
following a disagreement between observations and theoretical models. The
latter predict SFRs at this redshift that are typically a factor 4 or more
lower than the measurements. We present star-formation rates based on
calorimetric measurements of the far-infrared (FIR) luminosities for massive
1.5<z<2.5, normal star-forming galaxies (SFGs), which do not depend on
extinction corrections and/or extrapolations of spectral energy distributions.
The measurements are based on observations in GOODS-N with the Photodetector
Array Camera & Spectrometer (PACS) onboard Herschel, as part of the PACS
Evolutionary Probe (PEP) project, that resolve for the first time individual
SFGs at these redshifts at FIR wavelengths. We compare FIR-based SFRs to the
more commonly used 24 micron and UV SFRs. We find that SFRs from 24 micron
alone are higher by a factor of ~4-7.5 than the true SFRs. This overestimation
depends on luminosity: gradually increasing for log L(24um)>12.2 L_sun. The
SFGs and AGNs tend to exhibit the same 24 micron excess. The UV SFRs are in
closer agreement with the FIR-based SFRs. Using a Calzetti UV extinction
correction results in a mean excess of up to 0.3 dex and a scatter of 0.35 dex
from the FIR SFRs. The previous UV SFRs are thus confirmed and the mean excess,
while narrowing the gap, is insufficient to explain the discrepancy between the
observed SFRs and simulation predictions.

that their first signal at the Large Hadron Collider would not be of a
gravitational nature such as graviton emission or small black holes, but rather
linked to the mechanism which fixes the unitarity problem. We also study models
with scalar fields with non minimal couplings to the Ricci scalar. We consider
the strength of gravity in these models and study the consequences for
inflation models with non-minimally coupled scalar fields. We show that a
single scalar field with a large non-minimal coupling can lower the Planck mass

to form Ni56 and other iron group elements. We present spherically symmetric

XMM-Newton observations of the soft X-ray background between $l=120\degr$ and
$l=240\degr$. These observations were chosen from a much larger set of
observations as they are expected to be the least contaminated by solar wind
charge exchange emission. We characterize the halo emission in the XMM-Newton
band with a single-temperature plasma model. We find that the observed halo
temperature is fairly constant across the sky (~1.8e6-2.3e6 K), whereas the
halo emission measure varies by an order of magnitude (~0.0005-0.006 cm^-6 pc).
When we compare our observations with the model predictions, we find that most
of the hot gas observed with XMM-Newton does not reside in isolated extraplanar
supernova remnants -- this model predicts emission an order of magnitude too
faint. A model of a supernova-driven interstellar medium, including the flow of
hot gas from the disk into the halo in a galactic fountain, gives good
agreement with the observed 0.4-2.0 keV surface brightness. This model
overpredicts the halo X-ray temperature by a factor of ~2, but there are a
several possible explanations for this discrepancy. We therefore conclude that
a major (possibly dominant) contributor to the halo X-ray emission observed
with XMM-Newton is a fountain of hot gas driven into the halo by disk
supernovae. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the extended hot
halo of accreted material predicted by disk galaxy formation models also
contributes to the emission.

of Herschel, as part of the PEP guaranteed time, to study the link between star
formation and stellar mass in galaxies to z~2. Starting from a stellar
mass-selected sample of ~4500 galaxies with mag[4.5mu]<23 (AB), we identify
~350 objects with a PACS detection at 100 or 160mu and ~1500 with only Spitzer
24 mu counterpart. Stellar masses and total IR luminosities (LIR) are estimated
by fitting the SEDs. Consistently with other Herschel results, we find that LIR
based only on 24 mu data is overestimated by a median factor ~1.8 at z~2,
whereas it is underestimated (with our approach) up to a factor ~1.6 at
0.5<z<1.0. We then exploit this calibration to correct LIR based on the MIPS
fluxes. These results clearly show how Herschel is fundamental to constrain
LIR, and hence the SFR, of high redshift galaxies. Using the galaxies detected
with PACS (and/or MIPS), we investigate the existence and evolution of the
relations between the star formation rate (SFR), the specific star formation
rate (SSFR=SFR/mass) and the stellar mass. Moreover, in order to avoid
selection effects, we also repeat this study through a stacking analysis on the
PACS images to fully exploit the far-IR information also for the Herschel and
Spitzer undetected subsamples. We find that the SSFR-mass relation steepens
with redshift, being almost flat at z<1.0 and reaching a slope of
alpha=-0.50^(+0.13)_(-0.16) at z~2, at odds with recent works based on
radio-stacking analysis at the same redshift. The mean SSFR of galaxies
increases with redshift, by a factor ~15 for massive M>10^(11) (M_sun) galaxies
from z=0 to z=2, and seems to flatten at z>1.5 in this mass range. Moreover,
the most massive galaxies have the lowest SSFR at any z, implying that they
have formed their stars earlier and more rapidly than their low mass
counterparts.

wealth of recently acquired and serendipitous archival data available to piece
together its evolution over the past decade, including a recent 485 ks Chandra
HETG spectrum. In order to interpret this data, we have explored hydrodynamic
simulations, followed by computations of simulated spectra and light curves
under non-equilibrium ionization conditions, and directly compared them to the
observations. Our simulated spectra manage to fit both the X-ray continuum and
lines at 4 epochs satisfactorily, while our computed light curves are in good
agreement with additional flux-monitoring data sets. These calculations allow
us to infer the nature and structure of the circumstellar medium, the evolution
of the SN shock wave, and the abundances of the ejecta and surrounding medium.
The data imply that SN 1996cr exploded in a low-density medium before
interacting with a dense shell of material about 0.03pc away from the
progenitor star. We speculate that the shell could be due to the interaction of
a blue supergiant or Wolf-Rayet wind with a previously existing red supergiant
(RSG) wind. The shock wave has now exited the shell and is expanding in the
medium exterior to it, possibly the undisturbed continuation of the dense RSG
wind. The narrow lines that earned SN 1996cr its IIn designation possibly arise
from dense, shocked clumps in the CSM. Although the possibility for an LBV
progenitor for this Type IIn SN cannot be completely excluded, it is
inconsistent with much of the data. These calculations allow us to probe the
stellar mass loss in the very last phases ($ < 10^4$ years) of a massive star's
life ($> 10^6$ years), and provide another means to deducing the progenitor of

different research fields ranging from fundamental issues of cavity QED to
specific applications such as microlasers and bio-sensors. A major issue in the
latter applications is the difficulty to obtain directional emission of light
in the far-field while keeping high energy densities inside the cavity (i.e.
high quality factor). To improve our understanding of these systems, we have
studied the annular cavity (a dielectric disk with a circular hole), where the
distance cavity-hole centers, d, is used as a parameter to alter the properties
of cavity resonances. We present results showing how one can affect the
directionality of the far-field while preserving the uniformity (hence the
quality factor) of the near-field simply by increasing the value of d.
Interestingly, the transition between a uniform near- and far-field to a
uniform near- and directional far-field is rather abrupt. We can explain this
behavior quite nicely with a simple model, supported by full numerical
calculations, and we predict that the effect will also be found in a large
class of eigenmodes of the cavity.

procedure capable to achieve these two apparently conflicting goals. With the
correspondence between the classical and the wave picture, properties of the
classical phase space shed some light on the characteristics of the wave
dynamics. Specifically, the annular cavity has a well separated mixed phase
space, a characteristic that proves to be of crucial importance in the emission
properties of WGMs. While the onset of directionality in the far-field may be
achieved through parametric deformation of the distance cavity-hole centers,
this contribution presents a method to control the emission profile via a
second parameter, the hole radius. The influence of the classical dynamics to

star forming regions even if they are not the primary source of velocity
dispersion for all scales of molecular clouds. For the rate and power expected
in star forming regions, we previously (Carroll et al. 2009) demonstrated that
outflows could drive supersonic turbulence at levels consistent with the
scaling relations from Matzner 2007 although with a steeper velocity power
spectrum than expected for an isotropically driven supersonic turbulent
cascade. Here we perform higher resolution simulations and combine simulations
of outflow driven turbulence with those of isotropically forced turbulence. We
find that the presence of outflows within an ambient isotropically driven
turbulent environment produces a knee in the velocity power spectrum at the
outflow scale and a steeper slope at sub-outflow scales than for a purely
isotropically forced case. We also find that the presence of outflows flattens
the density spectrum at large scales effectively reducing the formation of
large scale turbulent density structures. These effects are qualitatively
independent of resolution. We have also carried out Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) for synthetic data from our simulations. We find that PCA as a
tool for identifying the driving scale of turbulence has a misleading bias
toward low amplitude large scale velocity structures even when they are not
necessarily the dominant energy containing scales. This bias is absent for
isotropically forced turbulence but manifests strongly for collimated outflow
driven turbulence.

supplementing the Lorentz condition with causal determination of the time
component of the four-vector potential by retarded Coulomb transformation of
the charge density. This causal Lorentz gauge agrees with the Coulomb gauge for
static charge densities, but allows the four-vector potential to have a
longitudinal component that is determined by the time derivative of the
four-vector potential's time component. Just as in Coulomb gauge, the two
transverse components of the four-vector potential are its sole dynamical part.
The four-vector potential in this gauge covariantly separates into a dynamical
transverse four-vector potential and a nondynamical timelike/longitudinal
four-vector potential, where each of these two satisfies the Lorentz condition.
In fact, analogous partition of the conserved four-current shows each to
satisfy a Lorentz-condition Maxwell equation system with its own conserved
four-current. Because of this complete separation, either of these four-vector
potentials can be tinkered with without affecting its counterpart. Since it
satisfies the Lorentz condition, the nondynamical four-vector potential times a
constant with dimension of inverse length squared is itself a conserved
four-current, and so can be fed back into its own source current, which
transforms its time component into an extended Yukawa, with both exponentially
decaying and exponentially growing components. The latter might be the
mechanism of quark-gluon confinement: in non-Abelian color gauge theory the
Yukawa mixture ratio ought to be tied to color, with palpable consequences for
""colorful"" hot quark-gluon plasmas.

through the random geometric graph model. By contrast, there are relatively few
rigorous results on the practically important case of mobile networks, in which
the nodes move over time; moreover, these results often make unrealistic
assumptions about node mobility such as the ability to make very large jumps.
In this paper we consider a realistic model for mobile wireless networks which
we call mobile geometric graphs, and which is a natural extension of the random
geometric graph model. We study two fundamental questions in this model:
detection (the time until a given ""target"" point - which may be either fixed or
moving - is detected by the network), and percolation (the time until a given
node is able to communicate with the giant component of the network). For
detection, we show that the probability that the detection time exceeds t is
\exp(-\Theta(t/\log t)) in two dimensions, and \exp(-\Theta(t)) in three or
more dimensions, under reasonable assumptions about the motion of the target.
For percolation, we show that the probability that the percolation time exceeds
t is \exp(-\Omega(t^\frac{d}{d+2})) in all dimensions d\geq 2. We also give a
sample application of this result by showing that the time required to
broadcast a message through a mobile network with n nodes above the threshold
density for existence of a giant component is O(\log^{1+2/d} n) with high

providing the mechanisms to transfer information between atom qubits and photon
qubits, or to couple single atoms with the optical modes of the cavity field.
We explore numerically the population transfer in an atom + cavity system by
using the $\pi$-pulse and adiabatic passage methods. While the first method is
very efficient transferring the atomic population for no radiative decay of the
intermediate level, the second method shows very interesting nonadiabatic,
resonance-like properties that can be used to achieve very large transfer
efficiencies without needing very large Rabi frequencies or very long
interaction times. We introduce a simple analytical model to explore the origin
of these properties and describe ""qualitatively"" the power-law dependence of
the failure probability on the product of the pulse amplitude and the
interaction time. We also examine numerically the transfer of interatomic
coherence in a two-atom + cavity system by using adiabatic methods. For some
specific symmetry conditions, we show that the dynamics of the original system
can be studied as the individual evolution of a symmetric and an antisymmetric
system, interacting separately with the classical field and the cavity mode,
but mutually exchanging the atomic coherence.

moreover, it is at most 1/2. Moving beyond the case of binary valuations but
restricting to single item auctions, where buyers' private valuations are
independent and identically distributed, we obtain bounds on the worst case ELR
as a function of number of buyers, cardinality of buyers' valuation set, and
ratio of maximum to minimum possible values that buyers can have for the item.

Consequently, 1) we find steady assumption is not valid in realistic situation,

density environments: galaxies in Compact Groups (HCGs), Isolated Pairs of
Galaxies (KPGs), and Isolated Galaxies (KIGs), which were taken as reference.
Using both characteristic isophotal parameters and evidence of asymmetries in
the optical and the near-infrared, we are able to establish differences in the
characteristics of galaxies with different morphologies in different
environments, allowing us to better understand their different formation
histories. In this first paper, we present the isophotal and asymmetry analyses
of a sample of 214 galaxies in different environments observed in the optical
(V and I images). For each galaxy, we have determined different characteristic
isophotal parameters and (V-I) color profiles, as a function of semi-major
axis, and performed a full asymmetry analysis in residual images using the V
filter. Evidence of asymmetry in the optical is almost missing in the KIG
sample and significantly more common in the KPG than in the HCG samples. Our
isophotal analysis suggests that the stellar populations in the HCG galaxies
are older and more dynamically relaxed than in the KPG. The HCG galaxies seem
to be at a more advanced stage of interaction than the KPGs. One possible
explanation is that these structures formed at different epochs: compact groups
of galaxies would have formed before close pairs of galaxies, which only began
interacting recently. However, similarities in the formation process of
galaxies with same morphology suggest CGs and close pairs of galaxies share
similar conditions; they are new structures forming relatively late in
low-density environments.

adjustments to the Ne K edge and in some occasions also to the Mg K edge. The
Ne K edge appears variable in terms of optical depths and morphology. The edge
reveals average blue- and red-shifted values implying Doppler velocities of the
order of 3500 \kms. The data show that Ne K exhibits excess column densities of
up to several 10$^{18}$ cm$^{-2}$. The variability proves that the excess is
intrinsic to the source. The correponding disk velocities also imply an outer
disk radius of the order of $< 10^9$ cm consistent with an ultra-compact binary
nature. We also detect a prominent soft emission line complex near the \oviii
L$\alpha$ position which appears extremely broad and relativistic effects from
near the innermost disk have to be included. Gravitationally broadened line
fits also provide nearly edge-on angles of inclination between 86 and

prove that a subset of an abelian group G is algebraic if and only if it is
closed in every precompact (=totally bounded) Hausdorff group topology on G.
The family of all algebraic subsets of an abelian group G forms the family of
closed subsets of a unique Noetherian T_1 topology on G called the Zariski, or
verbal, topology of G. We investigate the properties of this topology. In
particular, we show that the Zariski topology is always hereditarily separable

of cardinality at most the continuum, we construct a precompact metric group

Zariski closure. As an application, we provide a characterization of the
subsets of G that are dense in some Hausdorff group topology on G, and we show
that such a topology, if it exists, can always be chosen so that it is

and nine OFRGs located in the GOODS-N and the A2218 fields. This sample is
cross-matched with our PACS 100 um and 160 um multi-wavelength catalogs. About
half of the galaxies in our sample are detected with PACS. The dust
temperatures and the infrared luminosities of our galaxies are derived by
fitting their PACS and SCUBA 850 um (only the upper limits for the OFRGs) flux
densities with a single modified (beta=1.5) black body function. The median
dust temperature of our SMG sample is T=36+/-8K while for our OFRG sample it is
T=47+/-3K. For both samples, median dust temperatures derived from Herschel
data agree well with previous estimates. In particular, Chapman et al. (2005)
found a dust temperature of T=36+/-7K for a large sample of SMGs assuming the
validity of the FIR/radio correlation. The agreement between our studies
confirms that the local FIR/radio correlation effectively holds at high
redshift even though we find <q>=2.17+/-0.19, a slightly lower value than that
observed in local systems. The median IR luminosities of SMGs and OFRGs are
4.6*10^12 Lsun and 2.6*10^12 Lsun, respectively. We note that for both samples
the IR luminosity estimates from the radio part of the spectral energy
distribution are accurate, while estimates from the mid-IR are considerably
(x3) more uncertain. Our observations confirm the remarkably high luminosities
of SMGs and thus imply median star-formation rates of 960Msun yr^-1 for SMGs
with S(850um)>5mJy and 460Msun yr^-1 for SMGs with S(850um)>2mJy, assuming a
Chabrier IMF and no dominant AGN contribution to the far-infrared luminosity.

propose suboptimal estimators. These estimators exploit both signal and data

MLEs reduce to traditional fusion based or diversity based estimators when
communications or observations are perfect. By introducing a general message
function, the proposed estimators can be applied when various analog or digital

gravitational system could be regarded as a thermodynamical system. It is
well-known that the equipartition law of energy is invalid at very low
temperature. Therefore, entropic force should be modified while the temperature
of the holographic screen is very low. It is shown that the modified entropic
force is proportional to the square of the acceleration, while the temperature
of the holographic screen is much lower than the Debye temperature $T_D$. The
modified entropic force returns to the Newton's law of gravitation while the
temperature of the holographic screen is much higher than the Debye
temperature. The modified entropic force is connected with modified Newtonian
dynamics (MOND). The constant $a_0$ involved in MOND is linear in the Debye
frequency $\omega_D$, which can be regarded as the largest frequency of the
bits in screen. We find that there do have a strong connection between MOND and
cosmology in the framework of Verlinde's entropic force, if the holographic
screen is taken to be bound of the Universe. The Debye frequency is linear in
the Hubble constant $H_0$.

decide against just selling my mathematical wares, and for a survey,
necessarily very selective, but taking a global phenomenological approach to
its subject matter. After all, non-commutative geometry does not purport yet to
solve the riddle of quantum gravity; it is more of an insurance policy against
the probable failure of the other approaches. The plan is as follows: the
introduction invites students to the fruitful doubts and conundrums besetting
the application of even classical gravity. Next, the first experiments
detecting quantum gravitational states inoculate us a healthy dose of
skepticism on some of the current ideologies. In Section 3 we look at the
action for general relativity as a consequence of gauge theory for quantum
tensor fields. Section 4 briefly deals with the unimodular variants. Section 5
arrives at non-commutative geometry. I am convinced that, if this is to play a
role in quantum gravity, commutative and non-commutative manifolds must be
treated on the same footing; which justifies the place granted to the
reconstruction theorem. Together with Section 3, this part constitutes the main
body of the notes. Only very summarily at the end of this section we point to
some approaches to gravity within the non-commutative realm. The last section
delivers a last dose of skepticism. My efforts will have been rewarded if
someone from the young generation learns to mistrust current mindsets.

transients. The X-ray spectrum can be fitted by a single, hard power-law. We
detect optical variability of ~ 0.05 magnitudes, on timescales of minutes, but
find no periodic modulation. In the optical, the SEDs contain a blue component,
indicative of an irradiated disc, and a transient near-infrared (NIR) excess.
This excess is consistent with a simple model of an optically thick synchrotron
jet (as seen in other outbursting AMXPs). The optical spectrum shows a
double-peaked H alpha profile, a diagnostic of an accretion disc, but we do not
clearly see other lines (e.g. He I, II) reported in 2004. Optical/IR
observations of AMXPs are excellent for studying the evolution of both the
outer accretion disc and the inner jet, and may eventually provide us with
tight constraints to model disc-jet coupling in accreting neutron stars.

absolute K-band luminosity, colour and star-formation rate. Comparing the
deprojected clustering amplitudes, we find that red galaxies are more strongly
clustered than blue galaxies out to at least z = 1.5, irrespective of
rest-frame K-band luminosity. We then construct passive and star-forming
samples based on stellar age, colour and star-formation histories calculated
from the best fitting templates. The clustering strength of star-forming
galaxies declines steadily from r_0 ~ 7 h^-1 Mpc at z ~ 2 to r_0 ~ 3 h^-1 Mpc
at z ~ 0, while passive galaxies have clustering strengths up to a factor of
two higher. Within the passive and star-forming subsamples, however, we find
very little dependence of galaxy clustering on K-band luminosity. Galaxy
`passivity' appears to be the strongest indicator of clustering strength. We
compare these clustering measurements with those predicted for dark matter
halos and conclude that passive galaxies typically reside in halos of mass M >
10^13 M_sun while luminous star-forming galaxies occupy halos an order of
magnitude less massive over the range 0.5 < z < 1.5. The decline in the
clustering strength of star-forming galaxies with decreasing redshift indicates
a decline in the hosting halo mass for galaxies of a given luminosity. We find
evidence for convergence of clustering in star-forming and passive galaxies
around z ~ 2, which is consistent with this being the epoch at which the red
sequence of galaxies becomes distinct.

of light (non-pseudo-Goldstone) scalars having masses smaller than the Kaluza
Klein scale, M_KK, in extra-dimensional models, or the gravitino mass, M_3/2,

lore: that the scale of gravitational physics, M_g, (e.g. the string scale,
M_s, in string theory) is of order the Planck mass, M_p = 10^18 GeV. We explore
sensitivity to this assumption using the spectrum of masses arising within the
specific framework of large-volume string compactifications, for which the
ultraviolet completion at the gravity scale is explicitly known to be a Type
IIB string theory. In such models the separation between M_g and M_p is
parameterized by the (large) size of the extra dimensional volume, V (in string
units), according to M_p: M_g: M_KK: M_3/2 = 1: V^{-1/2}: V^{-2/3}: V^{-1}. We
find that the generic size of quantum corrections to masses is of the order of
M_KK M_3/2 / M_p ~ M_p / V^{5/3}. The mass of the lighest modulus
(corresponding to the extra-dimensional volume) which at the classical level is
M_V ~ M_p/V^{3/2} << M_3/2 << M_KK is thus stable against quantum corrections.
This is possible because the couplings of this modulus to other forms of matter
in the low-energy theory are generically weaker than gravitational strength
(something that is also usually thought not to occur according to standard
lore). We discuss some phenomenological and cosmological implications of this
observation.

the usability and user experience qualities of accessible synchronous
computer-mediated communication applications. The methodology goes beyond
current practices by evaluating how the interaction between a user and a
product influences the user experience of those at the other endpoint of the
communication channel. A major contribution is given with the proposal of a
user test where one of the participants tries to guess whether the other
participant has a disability or not. The proposed test is inspired in the
Turing Test, and is a consequence of user requirements elicited from a group of
individuals with motor and speech disabilities. These ideas are tested and
validated with two examples of synchronous communication applications.

Background (CMB) radiation plays a crucial role in probing the relic
gravitational wave (RGW) background. In this paper, we propose a new method to
deconstruct a polarization map on an incomplete sky in real space into purely
electric and magnetic polarization type maps, ${\mathcal{E}}(\hat{\gamma})$ and
${\mathcal{B}}(\hat{\gamma})$, respectively. The main properties of our
approach are as follows: Firstly, the fields ${\mathcal{E}}(\hat{\gamma})$ and
${\mathcal{B}}(\hat{\gamma})$ are constructed in real space with a minimal loss
of information. This loss of information arises due to the removal of a narrow
edge of the constructed map in order to remove various numerical errors,
including those arising from finite pixel size. Secondly, this method is fast
and can be efficiently applied to high resolution maps due to the use of the
fast spherical harmonics transformation. Thirdly, the constructed fields,
${\mathcal{E}}(\hat{\gamma})$ and ${\mathcal{B}}(\hat{\gamma})$, are scalar
fields. For this reason various techniques developed to deal with temperature
anisotropy maps can be directly applied to analyze these fields. As a concrete
example, we construct and analyze an unbiased estimator for the power spectrum
of the $B$-mode of polarization $C_{\ell}^{BB}$. Basing our results on the
performance of this estimator, we discuss the RGW detection ability of two
future ground-based CMB experiments, QUIET and POLARBEAR.

an important theoretical tool in studying the effects of primordially generated
non-Gaussianities on the large scale structure. The non-Gaussian mass function
has been calculated by several authors in different ways, typically by
exploiting the smallness of certain parameters which naturally appear in the
calculation, to set up a perturbative expansion. We improve upon the existing
results for the mass function by combining path integral methods and saddle
point techniques (which have been separately applied in previous approaches).
Additionally, we carefully account for the various scale dependent combinations
of small parameters which appear. Some of these combinations in fact become of
order unity for large mass scales and at high redshifts, and must therefore be
treated non-perturbatively. Our approach allows us to do this, and to also
account for multi-scale density correlations which appear in the calculation.
We thus derive an accurate expression for the mass function which is based on
approximations that are valid over a larger range of mass scales and redshifts
than those of other authors. By tracking the terms ignored in the analysis, we
estimate theoretical errors for our result and also for the results of others.
We also discuss the complications introduced by the choice of smoothing filter
function, which we take to be a top-hat in real space, and which leads to the
dominant errors in our expression. Finally, we present a detailed comparison
between the various expressions for the mass functions, exploring the accuracy
and range of validity of each.

has remained contentious since Eggen's initial formulation of moving groups in

mission, distance measurements for thousands of nearby, seemingly isolated
stars are currently available. With these distances, a high resolution
spectroscopic abundance analysis can be brought to bear on the alleged members
of these moving groups. If a structure is a relic of an open cluster, the
members can be expected to be monolithic in age and abundance inasmuch as
homogeneity is observed in young open clusters. In this work we have examined
34 putative members of the proposed Wolf 630 moving group using high resolution
stellar spectroscopy. The stars of the sample have been chemically tagged to
determine abundance homogeneity and confirm the existence of a homogeneous
subsample of 19 stars. Fitting the homogeneous subsample with Yale-Yonsei
isochrones yields a single evolutionary sequence of $\sim$2.7 $\pm$ 0.5 Gyr. It
is concluded that this 19 star subsample of the Wolf 630 moving group sample of

analyzing the model problem of a spherical homogeneous top-hat in an
Einstein-deSitter background cosmology. We derive the formal structure of the
LPT series expansion, working to arbitrary order in the initial perturbation
amplitude. The factors that regulate LPT convergence are identified by studying
the exact, analytic solution expanded according to this formal structure. The
key methodology is to complexify the exact solution, demonstrate that it is
analytic and apply well-known convergence criteria for power series expansions
of analytic functions.This analysis fully explains the previously reported
observation that LPT fails to predict the evolution of an underdense, open
region beyond a certain time. It also implies the existence of other examples,
including overdense, closed regions, for which LPT predictions should also
fail. We show that this is indeed the case by numerically computing the LPT
expansion in these problematic cases. The formal limitations to the validity of
LPT expansion are considerably more complicated than simply the first
occurrence of orbit crossings as is often assumed. Evolution to a future time
generically requires re-expanding the solution in overlapping domains that
ultimately link the initial and final times, each domain subject to its own
convergence criterion. We demonstrate that it is possible to handle all the
problematic cases by taking multiple steps (LPT re-expansion). We characterize
how the leading order numerical error for a solution generated by LPT re-
expansion varies with the choice of Lagrangian order and of time step size.
Convergence occurs when the Lagrangian order increases and/or the time step
size decreases in a simple, well-defined manner. We develop a recipe for time
step control for LPT re-expansion based on these results.

Abelian acting group (e.g. $\Z^d$-flows and $\R^d$-flows). The main result
states that every such extension apart from a coboundary can be represented by
a perturbation of a so-called Rokhlin skew product. We obtain as a corollary
that the topological ergodic decomposition of the skew product extension into
prolongations is continuous and compact with respect to the Fell topology on
the hyperspace. The right translation acts minimally on this decomposition,
therefore providing a minimal compact metric analogue to the Mackey action.
This topological Mackey action is a distal (possibly trivial) extension of a
weakly mixing factor (possibly trivial), and it is distal if and only if
perturbation of the Rokhlin skew product is defined by a topological
coboundary.

with the photometric period of 184.26 days found in Mennickent et al. 2010. The
optical spectra of the metallic lines in both systems show combined absorption
and emission components that imply that they are formed in a flattened
envelope. A comparison of the radial velocity variations in SMC-SC4 and the
separation of the V and R emission components in the Halpha emission profile
indicate that this envelope, and probably also the envelope around SMC-SC3, is
a circumbinary disk with a characteristic orbital radius some three times the
radius of the binary system. The optical spectra of SMC-SC3 and SMC-SC4 show,
respectively, HeI emission lines and discrete Blue Absorption Components (BACs)
in metallic lines. The high excitations of the HeI lines in the SMC-SC3
spectrum and the complicated variations of FeII emission and absorption
components with orbital phase in the spectrum of SMC-SC4 suggests that shocks
occur between the winds and various static regions of the stars' co-rotating
binary-disk complexes. We suggest that BACs arise from wind shocks from the A
star impacting the circumbinary disk and a stream of former wind-efflux from
the B star accreting onto the A star. We dub these objects prototype of a small

clusters with irregular boundaries. In this paper we propose two minimum
spanning trees based clustering algorithm. The first algorithm produces k
clusters with center and guaranteed intra-cluster similarity. The radius and
diameter of k clusters are computed to find the tightness of k clusters. The
variance of the k clusters are also computed to find the compactness of the
clusters. The second algorithm is proposed to create a dendrogram using the k
clusters as objects with guaranteed inter-cluster similarity. The algorithm is
also finds central cluster from the k number of clusters. The first algorithm
uses divisive approach, where as the second algorithm uses agglomerative
approach. In this paper we used both the approaches to find Informative Meta
similarity clusters.
