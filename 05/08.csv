used for future Double Beta Decay Experiments. The simultaneous read-out of the
heat and the scintillation light allows to discriminate between different
interacting particles aiming at the disentanglement and the reduction of
background contribution, key issue for next generation experiments. We will
describe the observed anticorrelation between the heat and the light signal and
we will show how this feature can be used in order to increase the energy
resolution of the bolometer over the entire energy spectrum, improving up to a
factor 2.6 on the 2615 keV line of 208Tl. The detector was tested in a 433 h
background measurement that permitted to estimate extremely low internal trace
contaminations of 232Th and 238U. The light yield of gamma/beta, alpha and
neutrons is presented. Furthermore we developed a method in order to correctly
evaluate the absolute thermal quenching factor of alpha particles in
scintillating bolometers.

products $E \times E'$ of elliptic curves with the same complex multiplication.
We prove that the number of split-CM points in a given class of h_2/Sp_4(Z) is
related to the coefficients of a weight 3/2 modular form studied by Eichler.
The main application of this result is a formula for the central value
$L(\psi_N, 1)$ of a certain Hecke L-series. The Hecke character $\psi_N$ is a
twist of the canonical Hecke character $\psi$ for the elliptic Q-curve A
studied by Gross, and formulas for $L(\psi, 1)$ as well as generalizations were
proven by Villegas and Zagier. The formulas for $L(\psin, 1)$ are easily
computable and numerical examples are given.

masses (Neuh\""auser et al. 2000), but having large error bars (4 to 145 Jupiter
masses, Neuh\""auser et al. 2009). Given its large projected separation from the
primary star, ~ 86 AU, and its young age ~ 10 Myrs), it has probably formed
star-like, and would then be a brown dwarf companion. Given the relatively
large changes in separation and position angle between TWA 5 A and B, we can
conclude that they orbit around each other on an eccentric orbit. Some evidence
is found for a curvature in the orbital motion of B around A - most consistent
with an elliptic (e=0.45) orbit. Residuals around the best-fit ellipse are
detected and show a small-amplitude (~ 18 mas) periodic sinusoid with ~ 5.7 yr

quark systems in a quark-gluon plasma, including bound state formation. The
heavy quark is treated as a non relativistic particle interacting with a
fluctuating field, whose correlator is determined by a hard thermal loop
approximation. This approximation, which concerns only the medium in which the
heavy quark propagates, is the only one that is made, and it can be improved.
The dynamics of the heavy quark is given exactly by a quantum mechanical path
integral that is calculated in this paper in the Euclidean space-time using
numerical Monte Carlo techniques. The spectral function of the heavy quark in
the medium is then reconstructed using a Maximum Entropy Method. The path
integral is also evaluated exactly in the case where the mass of the heavy
quark is infinite; one then recovers known results concerning the complex
optical potential that controls the long time behavior of the heavy quark. The
heavy quark correlator and its spectral function is also calculated
semi-analytically at the one-loop order, which allows for a detailed
description of the coupling between the heavy quark and the plasma collective
modes.

found to be different: the nucleation of superconductivity at high temperatures
is governed mainly by the typical lateral dimensions of the magnetic domains,

field- and temperature intervals where non-monotonous dependence of the
superconducting critical temperature Tc on the applied magnetic field H is
observed (for demagnetized F films). Further increase in the Df value results
in a global suppression of superconductivity. Thus, we determined an optimal

broad T and H range, what can be interesting for further studies of the
localized superconductivity in planar Al-based S/F hybrids and for development
of the devices which can exploit the localized superconductivity.

$\mathcal{P}_{w0}(^nE)$ ($n$-homogeneous polynomials that are weakly continuous
on bounded sets at 0). We introduce a polynomial version of property $(M)$ and
derive that if $\mathcal{P}_w(^nE)=\mathcal{P}_{w0}(^nE)$ and $\mathcal{K}(E)$
is an $M$-ideal in $\mathcal{L}(E)$, then $\mathcal{P}_w(^nE)$ is an $M$-ideal

disks are an essential ingredient in many theories of the formation of
planetary systems. The ratio of disk mass over stellar mass in the
circumstellar phase of a disk is largely determined by the angular momentum of
the original cloud core from which the system was formed. While full 3D or 2D
axisymmetric hydrodynamical models of accretion onto the disk automatically
treat all aspects of angular momentum, this is not so trivial for 1D and
semi-2D viscous disk models. Since 1D and semi-2D disk models are still very
useful for long-term evolutionary modelling of disks with relatively little
numerical effort, we investigate how the 2D nature of accretion affects the
formation and evolution of the disk in such models. A proper treatment of this
problem requires a correction for the sub-Keplerian velocity at which accretion
takes place. We develop an update of our semi-2D time-dependent disk evolution
model to properly treat the effects of sub-Keplerian accretion. The new model
also accounts for the effects of the vertical extent of the disk on the
accretion streamlines from the envelope. The disks produced with the new method
are smaller than those obtained previously, but their mass is mostly unchanged.
The new disks are a few degrees warmer in the outer parts, so they contain less
solid CO. Otherwise, the results for ices are unaffected. The 2D treatment of
the accretion results in material accreting at larger radii, so a smaller
fraction comes close enough to the star for amorphous silicates to be thermally
annealed into crystalline form. The lower crystalline abundances thus predicted
correspond more closely to observed abundances than did earlier model
predictions. We argue that thermal annealing followed by radial mixing must be
responsible for at least part of the observed crystalline material.

molecular gas in the circum-nuclear disk (CND) of the Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC1068.
Single-dish observations have provided evidence that the abundance of silicon
monoxide(SiO) in the CND of NGC1068 is enhanced by 3-4 orders of magnitude with
respect to the values typically measured in quiescent molecular gas in the
Galaxy. We aim at unveiling the mechanism(s) underlying the SiO enhancement. We
have imaged with the IRAM Plateau de Bure interferometer the emission of the
SiO(2-1) and CN(2--1) lines in NGC1068 at 150pc and 60pc spatial resolution,
respectively. We have also obtained complementary IRAM 30m observations of HNCO
and methanol (CH3OH) lines. SiO is detected in a disk of 400pc size around the
AGN. SiO abundances in the CND of (1-5)xE-09 are about 1-2 orders of magnitude
above those measured in the starburst ring. The overall abundance of CN in the
CND is high: (0.2-1)xE-07. The abundances of SiO and CN are enhanced at the
extreme velocities of gas associated with non-circular motions close to the AGN
(r<70pc). Abundances measured for CN and SiO, and the correlation of CN/CO and
SiO/CO ratios with hard X-ray irradiation, suggest that the CND of NGC1068 has
become a giant X-ray dominated region (XDR). The extreme properties of
molecular gas in the circum-nuclear molecular disk of NGC1068 result from the
interplay between different processes directly linked to nuclear activity.
Whereas XDR chemistry offers a simple explanation for CN and SiO in NGC1068,
the relevance of shocks deserves further scrutiny. The inclusion of dust grain
chemistry would help solve the controversy regarding the abundances of other
molecular species, like HCN, which are under-predicted by XDR models.

Our results confirm this anomaly at higher significance, namely with a p-value
of 0.31%. We perform the analysis using different exclusion masks, showing that
a particular region of the sky near the Galactic plane shows a higher variance
than 95.58% of the simulations whereas the rest of the sky has a lower variance
than 99.96% of the simulations. The relative difference in variance between
both regions is bigger than in 99.64% of the simulations. This anisotropic
distribution of power seems to be causing the anomaly since the model assumes
isotropy. Furthermore, this region has a clear frequency dependence between
41GHz and 61GHz or 94GHz suggesting that Galactic foreground residuals could be
responsible for the anomaly. Moreover, removing the quadrupole and the octopole
from data and simulations the anomaly disappears. The variance anomaly and the
previously reported quadrupole and octopole alignment seem therefore to be
related and could have a common origin. We discuss different possible causes
and Galactic foreground residuals seem to be the most likely one. These
residuals would affect the estimation of the angular power spectrum from the
WMAP data, which is used to generate Gaussian simulations, giving rise to an
inconsistency between the estimated and expected CMB variance. If the presence
of residuals is confirmed, the estimation of the cosmological parameters could
be affected.

the dynamical state of the Vela-D cores is analyzed. Comparison to dynamical
masses of a sub-sample of the Vela-D cores estimated from the 13CO survey of
Elia et al. (2007), is complicated by the fact that the 13CO linewidths are
likely to trace the lower density intercore material, in addition to the dense
gas associated with the compact cores observed by BLAST. In fact, the total
internal pressure of these cores, if estimated using the 13CO linewidths,
appears to be higher than the cloud ambient pressure. If this were the case,
then self-gravity and surface pressure would be insufficient to bind these
cores and an additional source of external confinement (e.g., magnetic field
pressure) would be required. However, if one attempts to scale down the 13CO
linewidths, according to the observations of high-density tracers in a small

gauged supergravity that consists of a single charged scalar field interacting
with the metric and a U(1) gauge field. Small very near extremal RNAdS black
holes in this system are unstable to decay by superradiant emission. The end
point of this instability is a small hairy black hole that we construct
analytically in a perturbative expansion in its charge. Unlike their RNAdS
counterparts, hairy black hole solutions exist all the way down to the BPS
bound, demonstrating that ${\cal N}=4$ Yang Mills theory has an ${\cal O}(N^2)$
entropy at all energies above supersymmetry. At the BPS bound these black holes
reduce to previously discussed regular, supersymmetric horizon free solitons.
We use numerical methods to continue the construction of these solitons to
large charges and find that the line of soliton solutions terminates at a
singular solution $S$ at a finite charge. We conjecture that a one parameter
family of singular supersymmetric solutions, which emerges out of $S$,
constitutes the BPS limit of hairy black holes at larger values of the charge.
At leading order in their charge, the thermodynamics of the small hairy black
holes constructed in this paper turns out to be correctly reproduced by
modeling these objects as a non interacting mix of an RNAdS black hole and the
supersymmetric soliton in thermal equilibrium. Assuming that a similar non
interacting model continues to apply upon turning on angular momentum, we also
predict a rich family of rotating hairy black holes, including new hairy
supersymmetric black holes. This analysis suggests interesting structure for
the space of (yet to be constructed) hairy charged rotating black holes in
$AdS_5\times S^5$, particularly in the near BPS limit.

We identify the independent field scale and coupling constant renormalizations

wave fluctuations tracks the renormalization of the local couplings. The

are shown to be consistent with our renormalization scheme. We describe the

breakdown of Fermi liquid behavior near the ""hot spots"" on the Fermi surface.
In particular, we find that the dynamical critical exponent z receives
corrections to its mean-field value z = 2. At higher orders in the loop
expansion, we find infrared singularities similar to those found by S.-S. Lee
for the problem of a Fermi surface coupled to a gauge field. A treatment of
these singularities implies that an expansion in 1/N, (where N is the number of
fermion flavors) fails for the present problem. We also discuss the
renormalization of the pairing vertex, and find an enhancement which scales as
logarithm-squared of the energy scale. A similar enhancement is also found for
a modulated bond order which is locally an Ising-nematic order.

simultaneously for the galaxy luminosity, mass, and velocity distributions. We
revisit this issue using a modern compilation of observational data along with
the best available large-scale cosmological simulation of dark matter. We find
that the standard cosmological model, used in conjunction with halo abundance
matching (HAM) and simple dynamical corrections, fits all basic statistics of
galaxies with circular velocities Vcirc > 80 km/s. Our observational constraint
is the luminosity-velocity relation which allows all types of galaxies to be
included. We have compiled data for a variety of galaxies ranging from dwarf
irregulars to giant ellipticals. The data present a clear monotonic
luminosity-velocity relation from 50 km/s to 500 km/s, with a bend below 80
km/s and a systematic offset between late- and early-type galaxies. For
comparison to theory, we employ our LCDM ""Bolshoi"" simulation of dark matter,
which has unprecedented mass and force resolution. We use halo abundance
matching to assign rank-ordered galaxy luminosities to the dark matter halos.
The resulting predictions for the luminosity-velocity relation are in excellent
agreement with the available data on both early-type and late-type galaxies for
the luminosity range from Mr = -14-22. We also compare our predictions for the
""cold"" baryon mass (i.e., stars and cold gas) of galaxies as a function of
circular velocity with the available observations, again finding a very good
agreement. The predicted circular velocity function is in agreement with the
galaxy velocity function for 80-400 km/s. However, we find that the dark matter
halos with Vcirc < 80 km/s are much more abundant than observed galaxies with
the same Vcirc . We find that the two-point correlation function of galaxies in
our model matches very well the results from the SDSS.

highlight the role of topology and design parameters on the performance.
Namely, we show that on fully-connected graphs the rate is bounded away from

on a wide class of locally-connected graphs, the rate goes to one and the
asymptotical error goes to zero, as the size of the network grows larger.

interstellar medium (ISM). Despite its importance, however, dust remains poorly
understood in terms of its origin, composition, and abundance throughout the
universe. Supernova remnants (SNRs) provide a laboratory for studying the
evolution of dust grains, as they are one of the only environments in the
universe where it is possible to observe grains being both created and
destroyed. SNRs exhibit collisionally heated dust, allowing dust to serve as a
diagnostic both for grain physics and for the plasma conditions in the SNR. I
present theoretical models of collisionally heated dust which calculate grain
emission as well as destruction rates. In these models, I incorporate physics
such as nonthermal sputtering caused by grain motions through the gas, a more
realistic approach to sputtering for small grains, and arbitrary grain
compositions porous and composite grains. I apply these models to infrared and
X-ray observations of Kepler's supernova and the Cygnus Loop in the galaxy, and
SNRs 0509-67.5, 0519-69.0, and 0540-69.3 in the LMC. X-ray observations
characterize the hot plasma while IR observations constrain grain properties
and destruction rates. Such a multi-wavelength approach is crucial for a
complete understanding of gas and dust interaction and evolution. Modeling of
both X-ray and IR spectra allows disentangling of parameters such as pre and
postshock gas density, as well as swept-up masses of gas and dust, and can
provide constraints on the shock compression ratio. Observations also show that
the dust-to-gas mass ratio in the ISM is lower by a factor of several than what
is inferred by extinction studies of starlight. Future observatories, such as
the James Webb Space Telescope and the International X-ray Observatory, will

deem to result in an almost isotropic CR spectrum. Yet the MILAGRO TeV
observatory discovered a sharp ($\sim10^{\circ})$ arrival anisotropy of CR
nuclei. We suggest a mechanism for producing a weak and narrow CR beam which
operates en route to the observer. The key assumption is that CRs are scattered
by a strongly anisotropic Alfven wave spectrum formed by the turbulent cascade
across the local field direction. The strongest pitch-angle scattering occurs
for particles moving almost precisely along the field line. Partly because this
direction is also the direction of minimum of the large scale CR angular
distribution, the enhanced scattering results in a weak but narrow particle
excess. The width, the fractional excess and the maximum momentum of the beam
are calculated from a systematic transport theory depending on a single scale
$l$ which can be associated with the longest Alfven wave, efficiently
scattering the beam. The best match to all the three characteristics of the
beam is achieved at $l\sim1$pc. The distance to a possible source of the beam
is estimated to be within a few 100pc. Possible approaches to determination of
the scale $l$ from the characteristics of the source are discussed. Alternative
scenarios of drawing the beam from the galactic CR background are considered.
The beam related large scale anisotropic CR component is found to be energy
independent which is also consistent with the observations.

  Effect of Mass Profile of Parent Galaxy","Submitted to PASJ",,"10.1093/pasj/62.5.1215",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We investigate the long-term dynamical evolution of star clusters in a steady
tidal field produced by its parent galaxy. In this paper, we focus on the
influence of mass profile of the parent galaxy. The previous studies were done
with the simplification where the parent galaxy was expressed by point mass. We
express different mass profiles of the parent galaxy by the tidal fields in
which the ratios of the epicyclic frequency to the angular velocity are
different. We compare the mass-loss timescale of star clusters whose tidal
radii are identical but in parent galaxies with different mass profile, by
means of orbits calculations in fixed cluster potential and N-body simulations.
In this situation, a cluster rotates around the parent galaxy more rapidly as
the parent galaxy has shallower mass profile. We found that the mass-loss
timescale increase 20% and 50% for the cases that the mass density profile of
the parent galaxies are proportional to R^-2 and R^-1.5 where R is the distance
from the galaxy center, compared to the point-mass case, in moderately strong
tidal field. Counterintuitively, a cluster which rotates around the parent
galaxy more rapidly has a longer lifetime. The increase of lifetime is due to
the fact that the fraction occupied by regular-like orbit increases in
shallower profile. Finally, we derive an evaluation formula for the mass-loss
timescale of clusters. Our formula can explain a property of the population of
the observed galactic globular clusters that their half-mass radii become
smaller as their distances from the galactic center become smaller.

one-dimensional (1D) system of two identical rectangular potential barriers,
which implies modelling the dynamics of its subprocesses -- transmission and
reflection -- at all stages of scattering. On its basis we define, for each
subprocess, the dwell time as well as the local (exact) and asymptotic
(extrapolated) group times. Our concept of the asymptotic transmission group
time confirms the validity of the Wigner phase time in the opaque limit, as
well as the existence of the usual and generalized Hartman effects predicted on
its basis. On the energy scale, this concept is valid everywhere in the high
energy region as well as in the low energy region, excepting resonance points
and their neighborhoods. On the contrary, the Buttiker dwell time is valid, as
the transmission time, just only at the resonance points. Our concept of the
transmission dwell time predicts monotonous growth of the tunneling time when
the distance between the opaque barriers increases. By our approach only this
time scale yields the true time spent, on average, by transmitted particles in
the region occupied by the system. We explain why the asymptotic and local
transmission group times cannot play this role and why the concept of {\it
transmission group} velocity lies beyond the scope of special relativity. And
else, all the transmission times admit only indirect measurements. Hence the
unambiguous interpretation of all tunneling-time experiments is impossible when
the transmission dynamics at all stages of scattering is unknown.

points; in support of this claim, scaling functions of two-point cumulants at
the uniaxial Lifshitz point of the three-dimensional ANNNI model were predicted
on the basis of this theory and found to be in excellent agreement with Monte
Carlo results [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{87}, 125702 (2001)]. The consequences
of the conjectured invariance equations are investigated. It is shown that
fewer solutions than anticipated by Henkel generally exist and contribute to
the scaling functions if these equations are assumed to hold for all (positive

than two independent solutions exists in the case relevant for the mentioned

perturbation theory in $4+m/2-\epsilon$ dimensions is used to determine the
scaling functions of the order-parameter and energy-density two-point cumulants
in momentum space to two-loop order. The results are mathematically
incompatible with Henkel's predictions except in free-field-theory cases.
However, the scaling function of the energy-density cumulant we obtain for m=1

The present accepted and old-fashioned photosynthesis mechanism model suffers
from few drawbacks and an important issue is the absence of driving force for
negative and positive charges separation. This article presents a new
qualitative model for this first step mechanism in natural catalytic systems
such as photosynthesis in green leaves. The model uses a concept of
semiconductor band gap engineering, such as the staggered energy band gap
line-up in semiconductors. To explain the primary mechanism in natural
photosynthesis the proposal is the following: incident light is absorbed inside
the leaves causing charges separation. The only energetic configuration that
allows charges separation under illumination is the staggered one between two
materials or molecules. We explain why (e-, h+) interacting charges can be
separated by using an energy staggered configuration, under illumination.
Following this model, the green light of plants can be seen as related to the
spent energy for charges separation. Green colour being mostly an emission and
not a reflection as currently presented. The arguments mentioned below show why
we cannot explain the photosynthesis first step mechanism, based on the
presently accepted model, and therefore the alternative model is presented.

semi-automatically into task stages. Cognitive load was assessed using a new
variant of the dual-task method. Average cognitive load was found to vary by
search task stages. It was significantly higher during query formulation and
user description of a relevant document as compared to examining search results

time-dependent density functional approximations. By using semiclassical
dynamics to compute correlation effects within a density-matrix functional
approach, we incorporate memory, including initial-state dependence, as well as
changing occupation numbers, and predict more observables in strong-field
applications.

a projective space, an intersection of a nonempty family of convex sets splits
into multiple connected components each of which is a convex set. Hence, such
an intersection is called a multi-convex set. We derive a duality for saturated
multi-convex sets: there exists an order anti-isomorphism between nonempty
saturated multi-convex sets in a real projective space and those in the dual
projective space. In discrete geometry and computational geometry, these
results allow to transform a given problem into a dual problem which sometimes
is easier to solve. This will be pursued in a later paper.
