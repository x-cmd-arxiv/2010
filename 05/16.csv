spacetime metric is discussed within the framework of classical field theory.
Polarization structure of the Dirac field is shown to be rich enough to
determine the spacetime metric locally and to explain the emergence of observed
matter as localized waveforms. The localization of the waveforms is explained
as the result of the local time slowdown and the Lorentz contraction as a
dynamic re-shaping of the waveforms in the course of their acceleration. A
definition of mass as a limiting curvature of the spinor-induced metric is
proposed. A view of the vacuum as a uniformly distributed unit invariant
density of the Dirac field with an explicitly preserved invariance of the light
cone is brought forward. Qualitative explanation of the observed charge
asymmetry as the consequence of the dynamics of localization is given. The
origin of the CP-violation is associated with the loss of the Poincare
invariance due to localization. Neutrinos are identified with the signals
emitted in the abrupt processes of creation or decay of localized objects and
the concept of the Majorana neutrino is revisited. The wave equation for the
classical pion field is derived from the Dirac equation. Its connection with
stresses, mass and charge fluxes in localized waveforms of the Dirac field is
traced. Some implications of the finite size of colliding objects for
high-energy processes are discussed. A possible difference between the
lifetimes and gyromagnetic ratios for positive and negative charges is
predicted. A hypothesis that known internal degrees of freedom are the local
spacetime (angular) coordinates that have no precise counterparts in Riemannian
geometry is proposed.

calculate the probability distribution and average velocity in the case of a
sinusoidal variation in the width of the channels. The reduction on the average
velocity is larger in the case of soft channels at small P\'eclet numbers and
for relatively narrow channels and the opposite is true at large P\'eclet
numbers and for wide channels. In the limit of large P\'eclet numbers the
convergence to bulk velocity is faster in the case of soft channels. The
leading order correction to the average velocity and marginal probability
distribution agree well with Brownian Dynamics simulations for the two types of

of quenched randomness, we introduce the idea of rare regions and discuss their
importance. We then analyze in detail the different phenomena that can arise at
magnetic quantum phase transitions in disordered metals, including quantum
Griffiths singularities, smeared phase transitions, and cluster-glass
formation. For each scenario, we discuss the resulting phase diagram and
summarize the behavior of various observables. We then review several recent
experiments that provide examples of these rare region phenomena. We conclude
by discussing limitations of current approaches and open questions.

much larger nanoparticles in Ar magnetron sputter deposition of WSi2, and the
effect of nanoparticles on the properties of amorphous thin films and
multilayers. Sputter deposition of thin films is monitored by in situ x-ray
scattering, including x-ray reflectivity and grazing incidence small angle
x-ray scattering. The results show an abrupt transition at an Ar background
pressure Pc; the transition is associated with the threshold for energetic
particle thermalization, which is known to scale as the product of the Ar
pressure and the working distance between the magnetron source and the
substrate surface. Below Pc smooth films are produced, while above Pc roughness
increases abruptly, consistent with a model in which particles aggregate in the
deposition flux before reaching the growth surface. The results from WSi2 films
are correlated with in situ measurement of stress in WSi2/Si multilayers, which
exhibits a corresponding transition from compressive to tensile stress at Pc.
The tensile stress is attributed to coalescence of nanoparticles and the
elimination of nano-voids.

obtained serendipitously by SuperWASP-North on 17 nights over a 42-night period
beginning on the night (2007 October 22-23) immediately prior to the outburst.
Photometry of 17P's unresolved coma in SuperWASP data taken on the first night
of the outburst is consistent with exponential brightening, suggesting that the
rapid increase in the scattering cross-section of the coma could be largely due
to the progressive fragmentation of ejected material produced on a very short
timescale at the time of the initial outburst, with fragmentation timescales
decreasing from t(frag)~2x10^3 s to t(frag)~1x10^3 s over our observing period.
Analysis of the expansion of 17P's coma reveals a velocity gradient suggesting
that the outer coma was dominated by material ejected in an instantaneous,
explosive manner. We find an expansion velocity at the edge of the dust coma of
v(exp) = 0.55+/-0.02 km/s and a likely outburst date of t_0=2007 October
23.3+/-0.3, consistent with our finding that the comet remained below
SuperWASP's detection limit of m(V)~15 mag until at least 2007 October 23.3.
Modelling of 17P's gas coma indicates that its outer edge, which was observed
to extend past the outer dust coma, is best explained with a single pulse of
gas production, consistent with our conclusions concerning the production of
the outer dust coma.

based on ""intentionally"" introducing a pseudo-nuisance parameter into
generalized linear models for the purpose of variance reduction. We first
consider the parameter whose norm is equal to one. By introducing a
pseudo-nuisance parameter into models to be estimated, an extra estimation is
asymptotically normal and is, more importantly, non-positively correlated to
the estimation that asymptotically achieves the Fisher/quasi Fisher
information. As such, the resulting estimation is asymptotically with smaller
variance-covariance matrices than the Fisher/quasi Fisher information. For
general cases where the norm of the parameter is not necessarily equal to one,
two-stage quasi-likelihood procedures separately estimating the scalar and
direction of the parameter are proposed. The traces of the limiting
variance-covariance matrices are in general smaller than or equal to that of
the Fisher/quasi-Fisher information. We also discuss the pros and cons of the
new methodology, and possible extensions. As this methodology of parameter
space augmentation is general, and then may be readily extended to handle, say,

stored in the form of stressed magnetic fields. In many cases, the released
energy seems to take the form of large numbers of electrons accelerated to high
energies or alternatively plasma heated to very high temperatures. The
transport of this energy into the remaining portion of the atmosphere results
in violent mass motion and strong emission across the electromagnetic spectrum.
One important phenomenon observed during flares is the appearance in coronal
magnetic loops of large amounts of upflowing, soft X-ray emitting plasma. It is
believed that this is due to chromospheric evaporation, the process of heating
cool chromospheric material beyond its ability to radiate. The pressure
increase in the evaporated plasma leads to a number of interesting phenomena in
the flare chromosphere. The sudden pressure increase initiates a downward
moving ""chromospheric condensation"", an overdense region which gradually
decelerates as it accretes material and propagates into the gravitationally
stratified chromosphere. Solutions to an equation of motion for this
condensation shows that its motion decays after about one minute of propagation
into the chromosphere. When the front of this downflowing region is supersonic
relative to the atmosphere ahead of it, a radiating shock will form. If the
downflow is rapid enough, the shock strength should be sufficient to excite UV
radiation normally associated with the transition region, and furthermore, the
radiating shock will be brighter than the transition region. These results lead
to a number of observationally testable relationships between the optical and
ultraviolet spectra from the condensation and radiating shock.

  special issue)",,"10.1051/0004-6361/201014638",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We report on the detection with the HIFI instrument on board the Herschel
satellite of the two hydrogen chloride isotopologues, H35Cl and H37Cl, towards
the massive star-forming region W3A. The J=1-0 line of both species was
observed with receiver 1b of the HIFI instrument at 625.9 and 624.9 GHz. The
different hyperfine components were resolved. The observations were modeled
with a non-local, non-LTE radiative transfer model that includes hyperfine line
overlap and radiative pumping by dust. Both effects are found to play an
important role in the emerging intensity from the different hyperfine
components. The inferred H35Cl column density (a few times 1e14 cm^-2), and
fractional abundance relative to H nuclei (~7.5e^-10), supports an upper limit
to the gas phase chlorine depletion of ~200. Our best-fit model estimate of the
H35Cl/H37Cl abundance ratio is ~2.1+/-0.5, slightly lower, but still compatible
with the solar isotopic abundance ratio (~3.1). Since both species were
observed simultaneously, this is the first accurate estimation of the
[35Cl]/[37Cl] isotopic ratio in molecular clouds. Our models indicate that even
for large line opacities and possible hyperfine intensity anomalies, the H35Cl
and H37Cl J=1-0 integrated line-intensity ratio provides a good estimate of the
35Cl/37Cl isotopic abundance ratio.

  Spectrum Sharing",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the past few years we have witnessed the paradigm shift from static
spectrum allocation to dynamic spectrum access/sharing. Orthogonal
Frequency-Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) is a promising mechanism to
implement the agile spectrum access. However, in wireless distributed networks
where tight synchronization is infeasible, OFDMA faces the problem of
cross-band interference. Subcarriers used by different users are no longer
orthogonal, and transmissions operating on non-overlapping subcarriers can
interfere with each other. In this paper, we explore the cause of cross-band
interference and analytically quantify its strength and impact on packet
transmissions. Our analysis captures three key practical artifacts: inter-link
frequency offset, temporal sampling mismatch and power heterogeneity. To our
best knowledge, this work is the first to systematically analyze the cause and
impact of cross-band interference. Using insights from our analysis, we then
build and compared three mitigating methods to combat cross-band interference.
Analytical and simulation results show that placing frequency guardband at link
boundaries is the most effective solution in distributed spectrum sharing,
while the other two frequency-domain methods are sensitive to either temporal
sampling mismatch or inter-link frequency offset. We find that the proper
guardband size depends heavily on power heterogeneity. Consequently, protocol
designs for dynamic spectrum access should carefully take into account the
cross-band interference when configuring spectrum usage.

(iii) valley-mixing due to short-range disorder, i.e., substitutional atoms,

magnitude and direction) valley-Zeeman-fields in the two dots, and hence acts
similarly to hyperfine interaction in conventional semiconductor quantum dots.
In the case of strong spin-orbit interaction, we identify a parameter regime

highlight the highly filamentary and clumpy structure of the interstellar
medium even in diffuse regions of the map. The power spectrum analysis shows
that the structure of the interstellar medium is well described by a single
power law with an exponent of -2.7 +- 0.1 at all scales from 30"" to 8 degrees.
That the power spectrum slope of the dust emission is constant down to the
SPIRE angular resolution is an indication that the inertial range of turbulence
extends down to the 0.01 pc scale. The power spectrum analysis also allows the
identification of a Poissonian component at sub-arcminute scales in agreement

recently been proposed as the basis of qubits [1-3]. Although signatures of
Andreev reflection and bound states in conductance have been widely reported
[4], it has been difficult to directly probe individual ABS. Here, we report
transport measurements of sharp, gate-tunable ABS formed in a
superconductor-quantum dot (QD)-normal system, which incorporates graphene. The
QD exists in the graphene under the superconducting contact, due to a
work-function mismatch [5, 6]. The ABS form when the discrete QD levels are
proximity coupled to the superconducting contact. Due to the low density of
states of graphene and the sensitivity of the QD levels to an applied gate

Cheban loops satisfy the mirror identity {(z.yx)x = zx.xy}. Loops that are both
left and right Cheban are called Cheban loops. Cheban loops can also be
characterized as those loops that satisfy the identity x(xy.z) = (y.zx)x. These
loops were introduced in Cheban, A. M. Loops with identities of length four and
of rank three. II. (Russian) General algebra and discrete geometry, pp.
117-120, 164, ""Shtiintsa"", Kishinev, 1980. Here we initiate a study of their
structural properties. Left Cheban loops are left conjugacy closed. Cheban
loops are weak inverse property, power associative, conjugacy closed loops;
they are centrally nilpotent of class at most two.

boost-invariant second order relativistic hydrodynamics to find proper time
evolution of the energy density and the temperature. The effect of
bulk-viscosity and non-ideal equation of state are taken into account in a
manner consistent with recent lattice QCD estimates. It is shown that the
\textit{non-ideal} gas equation of state i.e $\epsilon-3 P \neq 0$ behaviour of
the expanding plasma, which is important near the phase-transition point, can
significantly slow down the hydrodynamic expansion and thereby increase the
photon production-rates. Inclusion of the bulk viscosity may also have similar
effect on the hydrodynamic evolution. However the effect of bulk viscosity is
shown to be significantly lower than the \textit{non-ideal} gas equation of
state. We also analyze the interesting phenomenon of bulk viscosity induced
cavitation making the hydrodynamical description invalid. It is shown that
ignoring the cavitiation phenomenon can lead to a very significant over
estimation of the photon flux. It is argued that this feature could be relevant
in studying signature of cavitation in relativistic heavy ion collisions.
