in the dense photosphere and thus the photospheric magnetic fields would not
have rapid, irreversible changes associated with eruptions resulted from the
coronal magnetic reconnection. Motivated by the recent work of Hudson, Fisher &
Welsch (2008) on quantitatively evaluating the back reaction due to energy
release from the coronal fields, in this Letter we synthesize our previous
studies and present analysis of new events about flare-related changes of
photospheric magnetic fields. For the 11 X-class flares where vector
magnetograms are available, we always find an increase of transverse field at
the polarity inversion line (PIL) although only 4 events had measurements with
1 minute temporal resolution. We also discuss 18 events with 1 minute cadence
line-of-sight magnetogram observation, which all show prominent changes of
magnetic flux contained in the flaring Delta spot region. Except in one case,
the observed limb-ward flux increases while disk-ward flux decreases rapidly
and irreversibly after flares. This observational evidence provides support,
either directly or indirectly, for the theory and prediction of Hudson, Fisher
& Welsch that the photospheric magnetic fields must respond to coronal field
restructuring and turn to a more horizontal state near the PIL after eruptions.

damped symmetric mode, named helical edge magnetoplasmon, which is localized at
the edge states region for filling factors $\nu =1, 2$ and \textit{very strong
dissipation} $\eta_{T}=\xi /k_{x}\ell_{T}\agt\ln (1/k_{x}\ell_{T})\gg 1$, where
the characteristic length $\ell_{T}=k_{B}T\ell_{0}^{2}/\hbar v_{g}\gg

the local Hall conductivity at the edge states and $k_{x}$ is the wave vector
along the edge; here other EMP modes are strongly damped. The spatial structure
of the helical edge magnetoplasmon, transverse to the edge, is strongly
modified as the wave propagates along the edge. In the regime of \textit{weak
dissipation}, $\eta_{T}\ll 1$, we obtain exactly the damping of the fundamental
mode as a function of $k_{x}$. For $\nu=4$ and weak dissipation we find that
the fundamental modes of $n=0$ and $n=1$ Landau levels (LLs) are strongly
renormalized due to the Coulomb coupling. Renormalization of all these EMPs

we show that for any $k \ge 4$, a $(1+\epsilon)$-spanner with diameter at most

distributions, with effective temperature and concentrations of carriers. The
concentration and energy balance equations are solved taking into account an
interplay between weak energy relaxation and generation-recombination
processes. The nonlinear conductivity is calculated for the momentum relaxation

transition between bipolar and monopolar regimes of conductivity are obtained

of undesirable behavior among agents, such as control, manipulation, and
bribery in election systems. These kinds of voting strategies are often
tempting at the individual level but disastrous for the agents as a whole.
Creating election systems where the determination of such strategies is
difficult is thus an important goal.
  An interesting set of elections is that of scoring protocols. Previous work
in this area has demonstrated the complexity of misuse in cases involving a
fixed number of candidates, and of specific election systems on unbounded
number of candidates such as Borda. In contrast, we take the first step in
generalizing the results of computational complexity of election misuse to
cases of infinitely many scoring protocols on an unbounded number of
candidates. Interesting families of systems include $k$-approval and $k$-veto
elections, in which voters distinguish $k$ candidates from the candidate set.
  Our main result is to partition the problems of these families based on their
complexity. We do so by showing they are polynomial-time computable, NP-hard,
or polynomial-time equivalent to another problem of interest. We also
demonstrate a surprising connection between manipulation in election systems
and some graph theory problems.

proceeds by selecting two chains of coordinated events, each of which
represents an observer, and assigning a valuation to each chain. Events can be
projected onto each chain by identifying the earliest event on the chain that
can be informed about the event. In this way, each event can be quantified by a
pair of numbers, referred to a pair, that derives from the valuations on the
chains. Pairs can be decomposed into a sum of symmetric and antisymmetric
pairs, which correspond to time-like and space-like coordinates. From this
pair, we derive a scalar measure and show that this is the Minkowski metric.
The Lorentz transformations follow, as well as the fact that speed is a
relevant quantity relating two inertial frames, and that there exists a maximal
speed, which is invariant in all inertial frames. All results follow directly
from the Event Postulate and the adopted quantification scheme.

non-abelian gauge theory can be determined by a variational solution of the
anomaly equation, as shown by Riegert long ago. It is given by a nonlocal
expression, with the nonlocal interaction determined by the Green's function of
a conformally covariant operator of fourth order. In recent works it has been
shown that this interaction is mediated by a simple pole in an expansion around
a Minkowski background, coupled in the infrared in the massless fermion limit.
This result relies on the local formulation of the original action in terms of
two auxiliary fields, one physical scalar and one ghost, which take the role of
massless composite degrees of freedom. In the gravity case, the two scalars
have provided ground in favour of some recent proposals of an infrared approach
to the solution of the dark energy problem, entirely based on the behaviour of
the vacuum energy at the QCD phase transition. As a test of this general
result, we perform a complete one-loop computation of the effective action
describing the coupling of a non-abelian gauge theory to gravity. We confirm
the appearance of an anomaly pole which contributes to the trace part of the
$TJJ$ correlator and of extra poles in its trace-free part, in the quark and
gluon sectors, describing the coupling of the energy momentum tensor ($T$) to
two non abelian gauge currents ($J$).

trade the bandwidth needed for repair of a failed node with the amount of data
stored per node of the network. Minimum Storage Regenerating (MSR) codes
minimize first, the amount of data stored per node, and then the repair
bandwidth, while Minimum Bandwidth Regenerating (MBR) codes carry out the
minimization in the reverse order. An [n, k, d] regenerating code permits the
data to be recovered by connecting to any k of the n nodes in the network,
while requiring that repair of a failed node be made possible by connecting
(using links of lesser capacity) to any d nodes. Previous, explicit and general
constructions of exact-regenerating codes have been confined to the case n=d+1.
In this paper, we present optimal, explicit constructions of MBR codes for all
feasible values of [n, k, d] and MSR codes for all [n, k, d >= 2k-2], using a
product-matrix framework. The particular product-matrix nature of the

presence of preheating is investigated numerically. It is found that the
instability evolution depends strongly on the preheating length $L$ in front of
the ablation-front interface. For weak preheating ($L/L_{\rm SH}\leq f_0$,
where $L_{\rm SH}$ is the Spitzer-Harm length and $f_0\sim 20$ is a critical
value), the linear growth rate has a sharp maximum and a secondary spike-bubble
structure is generated. Interaction of this growing structure with the master
spike-bubble leads to rupture of the latter. However, for strong preheating
($L/L_{\rm SH}>20$), the linear growth rate has no sharp maximum and no
secondary spike-bubble is generated. Instead, the master spike-bubble evolves
into an elongated jet. These results are interpreted in terms of the evolution
and interaction of the instability-generated harmonic modes.

the stopping of the jet after a certain time, we study the evolution of the
total X-ray power, the surface brightness, angular size of the X-ray bright
region and the X-ray photon index, as functions of time and cocoon size, and
compare the predictions with observations. We find that the radio power drops
rapidly after the stopping of the jet, with a shorter time-scale than the X-ray
power. The X-ray spectrum initially hardens until the jet stops because the
steepening of electron spectrum is mitigated by the injection of fresh
particles, for electrons with $\gamma \ge 10^3$. This happens because of the
concurrence of two times scales, that of the typical jet lifetimes and cooling
due to inverse Compton scattering ($\sim 10^{7\hbox{--}8}$ yr), of electrons
responsible for scattering CMB photons into keV range photons (with $\gamma
\sim \sqrt{1 \, {\rm keV}/ kT_{CMB}}$). Another finding is that the ratio of
the X-ray to radio power is a robust parameter that varies mostly with redshift
and ambient density, but is weakly dependent on other parameters. We also
determine the time-averaged ratio of X-ray to radio luminosities (at 1 keV and
151 MHz) and find that it scales with redshift as $\propto (1+z)^{3.8}$, for
typical values of parameters. We then estimate the X-ray luminosity function of

suppress the sidelobe level of a minimum variance distortionless response
(MVDR) beamformer. In this letter, we introduce a weighted sparse constraint in
the beamformer design to provide a lower sidelobe level and deeper nulls for
interference avoidance, as compared with a conventional MVDR beamformer. The
proposed beamformer also shows improved robustness against the mismatch between
the steering angle and the direction of arrival (DOA) of the desired signal,
caused by imperfect estimation of DOA.

is studied in this paper. Two separate branches denoted by $\epsilon=\pm1$ of
the DGP model are analyzed. Assuming the existence of a perfect fluid with a
constant equation of state, $w$, in the universe, we find that, for the branch
with $\epsilon=1$, there is no a stable Einstein static solution, while, for
the case with $\epsilon=-1$, the Einstein static universe exists and it is
stable when $-1<w<-1/3$. Thus, the universe can stay at this stable state
past-eternally and may undergo a series of infinite, non-singular oscillations.
Therefore, the big bang singularity problem in the standard cosmological model
can be resolved.

remaining cases: the cubic embedding of the Hirzebruch surface $F_1$, the
Cayley cubic (or a smooth surface in the same family), for a quartic surface
that degenerates to the union of a triple point and a plane not through the
triple point, and for a quartic $4$-point. In an appendix, we also include the

by quantum discord between two uncoupled qubits, which are immersed in a common
Ohmic environment. We show that the quantum discord of the two noninteracting
qubits can be greatly amplified or protected for certain initially prepared
$X$-type states in the time evolution. Especially, it is found that there does
exist the stable amplification of the quantum discord for the case of two
identical qubits, and the quantum discord can be protected for the case of two
different qubits with a large detuning. It is also indicated that in general
there does exist a sudden change of the quantum discord in the time evolution
at a critic time point $t_c$, and the discord amplification and protection may
occur only in the time interval $0<t\leq t_c$ for certain $X$-type states. This
sheds new light on the creation and protection of quantum correlation.

sparse. This sparsity can be characterized by parameters $s$ and $g$ that

galaxy formation scenarios. The giant HI ring in the Leo group is one of the
largest and most intriguing HI structures in the nearby Universe. Whether it
consists of primordial gas, as suggested by the apparent absence of any optical
counterpart and the absence of an obvious physical connection to nearby
galaxies, or of gas expelled from a galaxy in a collision is actively debated.
We present deep wide field-of-view optical images of the ring region obtained
with MegaCam on the CFHT. They reveal optical counterparts to several HI and UV
condensations along the ring, in the g', r', and i' bands, which likely
correspond to stellar associations formed within the gaseous ring. Analyzing
the spectral energy distribution of one of these star-forming regions, we found
it to be typical for a star-forming region in pre-enriched tidal debris. We
then use simulations to test the hypothesis that the Leo ring results from a
head-on collision between Leo group members NGC 3384 and M96. According to our
model which is able to explain, at least qualitatively, the main observational
properties of the system, the Leo ring is consistent with being a collisional
ring. It is thus likely another example of extended intergalactic gas made-up
of pre-enriched collisional debris.

The rotations form a 3-dimensional projective space, which fact has not been
exploited in Computer Science. We use the four affine patches of this
projective space to parametrize the rotations. This affine patch representation
is more compact than quaternions (which require 4 components for calculations),
encompasses the entire rotation group without singularities (unlike the Euler
angles and rotation vector approaches), and requires only ratios of linear or
quadratic polynomials for basic computations (unlike the Euler angles and
rotation vector approaches which require transcendental functions).
  As an example, we derive the differential equation for the integration of
angular velocity using this affine patch representation of rotations. We remark
that the complexity of this equation is the same as the corresponding
quaternion equation, but has advantages over the quaternion approach e.g.
renormalization to unit length is not required, and state space has no dead
directions.
