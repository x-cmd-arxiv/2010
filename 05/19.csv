and taught in a simple way. We show, using the Gauss's method to sum an
arithmetic sequence, how we can construct the superposition of waves - with
different frequencies - in a simple conceptual way that it is easy to teach. By
this method we arrive to the usual result where we can express the
superposition of waves as the product of factors, one of them with a cosine
funtion where the argument is the average frequency. Most important, we will
show that the superposition of waves with sligthly different frequencies
produces a \emph{phase modulation} thogether with an amplitude moldulation. It
is important to emphasize this result because, to the best of our knowledge,
almost all textbooks only mention that there is an amplitude modulation.

decoded) and per-user packet outage in a cellular network using multi-user
detection with successive interference cancellation (MUD-SIC). We consider
non-ergodic fading channels where microscopic fading channel information is not
available at the transmitters. As a result, packet outage occurs whenever the
data rate of packet transmissions exceeds the instantaneous mutual information
even if powerful channel coding is applied for protection. We are interested to
study the role of macro-diversity (MDiv) between multiple base stations on the
MUD-SIC performance where the effect of potential error-propagation during the
SIC processing is taken into account. While the jointly optimal power and
decoding order in the MUD-SIC are NP hard problem, we derive a simple on/off
power control and asymptotically optimal decoding order with respect to the
transmit power. Based on the information theoretical framework, we derive the
closed-form expressions on the total system goodput as well as the per-user
packet outage probability. We show that the system goodput does not scale with
SNR due to mutual interference in the SIC process and macro-diversity (MDiv)
could alleviate the problem and benefit to the system goodput.

have a significant impact, cancelling the Standard Model neutrino contribution
for masses lighter than the nuclear scale and leading to vanishing neutrinoless
double beta decay amplitudes even if neutrinos are Majorana particles. We also
discuss how seesaw models could reconcile large rates of neutrinoless double
beta decay with more stringent cosmological bounds on neutrino masses.

whole population, having arisen in a single individual, is known as the
fixation probability. In general, it is not possible to find the fixation
probability analytically given the mutant's fitness and the topological
constraints that govern the spread of the mutation, so one resorts to
simulations instead. Depending on the topology in use, a great number of
evolutionary steps may be needed in each of the simulation events, particularly
in those that end with the population containing mutants only. We introduce two
techniques to accelerate the determination of the fixation probability. The
first one skips all evolutionary steps in which the number of mutants does not
change and thereby reduces the number of steps per simulation event
considerably. This technique is computationally advantageous for some of the
so-called layered networks. The second technique, which is not restricted to
layered networks, consists of aborting any simulation event in which the number
of mutants has grown beyond a certain threshold value, and counting that event
as having led to a total spread of the mutation. For large populations, and
regardless of the network's topology, we demonstrate, both analytically and by
means of simulations, that using a threshold of about 100 mutants leads to an
estimate of the fixation probability that deviates in no significant way from
that obtained from the full-fledged simulations. We have observed speedups of
two orders of magnitude for layered networks with 10000 nodes.

spectroscopic and photometric characterization of low-mass brown dwarfs of the
~120 Myr old Pleiades open cluster. We obtained low-resolution near-infrared
spectra of the J=17.4-18.8 mag candidate L-type brown dwarfs PLIZ 28 and 35,
BRB 17, 21, 23, and 29, which are Pleiades members by photometry and proper
motion. We also obtained spectra of the well-known J=15.4-16.1 mag late M-type
cluster members PPl 1, Teide 1, and Calar 3. We find that the former six
objects have early- to mid-L spectral types and confirm previously reported
M-types for the other three objects. The spectra of the L0-type BRB 17 and PLIZ
28 present a triangular H-band continuum shape, indicating that this peculiar
spectral feature persists until at least the age of the Pleiades. We add to our
sample 36 reported M5-L0-type cluster members, collecting their I_c - and
UKIDSS ZYJHK-band photometry. We confirm a possible interleaving of the
Pleiades and field L-type sequences in the JHK absolute magnitude versus
spectral type diagrams, and quantify marginally redder Pleiades J-K colours, by
0.12+-0.20 mag, possibly related to both reddening and youth. Using field dwarf
bolometric correction - and effective temperature - spectral type relations, we
obtain the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of the Pleiades sample. Theoretical
models reproduce well the spectral sequence at M5.5-9, but appear to
overestimate the luminosity or underestimate the effective temperature at L0-5.
For the Pleiades early- to mid L-type brown dwarfs, we estimate theoretical
masses to be in the range 0.025-0.035 M_Sol.

obscuration manifests itself in different flavours. For two sources there is
evidence for a reflection dominated continuum; among the other three, one is
""mildly"" Compton thick (N_H ~ 10^24 cm-2), while the remaining two are heavily
obscured (N_H ~ 10^23.5 cm-2), but Compton thin. Strong, narrow, iron Kalpha
lines (EW ~ 1-2 keV) due to neutral or mildly ionized gas, are detected in
Compton thick AGN. In all of them the Kalpha line is accompanied by the Kbeta.
The intensity and shape of the soft X-ray spectrum are different from object to
object. Soft X--rays may originate from a nuclear component scattered off, or
leaking through, the X-ray absorber, plus thermal X-rays from the host galaxy.
Emission from circumnuclear gas photoionized by the active nucleus,
parameterized with a power law plus individual narrow Gaussian lines, also
provides an acceptable description of the soft X-ray spectra. The limited
Suzaku XIS CCD energy resolution does not allow us to draw firm conclusions on
the origin of the soft X--ray emission. We briefly discuss our findings in the

entangled state with the charged lepton. This correlated state is disentangled
by the measurement of the charged lepton in a detector at the production site.
We study the dynamical aspects of disentanglement, propagation and detection,
in particular the conditions under which the disentangled state is a coherent
superposition of mass eigenstates. The appearance and disappearance
far-detection processes are described from the time evolution of this
disentangled ""collapsed"" state. The familiar quantum mechanical interpretation
and factorization of the detection rate emerges when the quantum state is
disentangled on time scales \emph{much shorter} than the inverse oscillation
frequency, in which case the final detection rate factorizes in terms of the
usual quantum mechanical transition probability provided the final density of
states is insensitive to the neutrino energy difference. We suggest
\emph{possible} corrections for short-baseline experiments. If the charged
lepton is unobserved, neutrino oscillations and coherence are described in
terms of a reduced density matrix obtained by tracing out an un-observed
charged lepton. The diagonal elements in the mass basis describe the production
of mass eigenstates whereas the off diagonal ones provide a measure of
coherence. It is shown that coherences are of the same order of the diagonal
terms on time scales up to the inverse oscillation frequency, beyond which the
coherences oscillate as a result of the interference between mass eigenstates.

wavelengths: in the gamma-ray band, peak emission was reached on December 2-3,
2009. Remarkably, this gamma-ray super-flare was not accompanied by
correspondingly intense emission in the optical/UV band that reached a level
substantially lower than the previous observations in 2007-2008. The lack of
strong simultaneous optical brightening during the super-flare and the
determination of the broad-band spectral evolution severely constrain the

emission from an accretion disk and a broad-line region. However, the spectra

partitioning the entire network into communities, with the expectation of many
ties within communities and few ties between. However, many networks contain
nodes that do not fit in with any of the communities, and forcing every node
into a community can distort results. Here we propose a new framework that
focuses on community extraction instead of partition, extracting one community
at a time. The main idea behind extraction is that the strength of a community
should not depend on ties between members of other communities, but only on
ties within that community and its ties to the outside world. We show that the
new extraction criterion performs well on simulated and real networks, and
establish asymptotic consistency of our method under the block model
assumption.

the selected escaped plutinos in order to study their dynamical post escaped

of plutinos and their evolution in the Centaur zone. We obtained a present rate
of escape of plutinos between 1 and 10 every 10 years. The escaped plutinos
have a mean lifetime in the Centaur zone of 108 Myr and their contribution to
the Centaur population would be a fraction of less than 6 % of the total

approach for the gravitational field of the central body and study properties
of the halo orbits in detail. Within the general relativistic approach, we
carry out our calculations in two cases. Firstly, we examine the case of a
rotating magnetic compact star. Assuming that the magnetic field axis and the
rotation axis are aligned with each other, we study the orientation of motion
along the stable halo orbits. In the poloidal plane, we also discuss shapes of
the related effective potential halo lobes where the general off-equatorial
motion can be bound. Then we focus on the halo orbits near a Kerr black hole
immersed in an asymptotically uniform magnetic field of external origin. We
demonstrate that, in both the cases considered, the lobes exhibit two different
regimes, namely, one where completely disjoint lobes occur symmetrically above
and below the equatorial plane, and another where the lobes are joined across
the plane. A possible application of the model concerns the structure of
putative circumpulsar discs consisting of dust particles. We suggest that the

supernova explosions far out of proportion to their small numbers. However, the
physical processes that initiate and govern the birth of massive stars remain
poorly understood. Two widely discussed models are monolithic collapse of
molecular cloud cores and competitive accretion. To learn more about massive
star formation, we perform simulations of the collapse of rotating, massive,
cloud cores including radiative heating by both non-ionizing and ionizing
radiation using the FLASH adaptive mesh refinement code. These simulations show
fragmentation from gravitational instability in the enormously dense accretion
flows required to build up massive stars. Secondary stars form rapidly in these
flows and accrete mass that would have otherwise been consumed by the massive
star in the center, in a process that we term fragmentation-induced starvation.
This explains why massive stars are usually found as members of high-order
stellar systems that themselves belong to large clusters containing stars of
all masses. The radiative heating does not prevent fragmentation, but does lead
to a higher Jeans mass, resulting in fewer and more massive stars than would
form without the heating. This mechanism reproduces the observed relation
between the total stellar mass in the cluster and the mass of the largest star.
It predicts strong clumping and filamentary structure in the center of
collapsing cores, as has recently been observed. We speculate that a similar
mechanism will act during primordial star formation.

resolving the binary for the first time in X-rays and allowing the coronae of
the two stars to be studied separately. With the contributions of Xi Boo A and
B to the system's total X-ray emission now observationally established (88.5%
and 11.5%, respectively), consideration of mass loss measurements for GK dwarfs
of various activity levels (including one for Xi Boo) leads to the surprising
conclusion that Xi Boo B may dominate the wind from the binary, with Xi Boo A's
wind being very weak despite its active corona. Emission measure distributions
and coronal abundances are computed for both stars and compared with Chandra
measurements of other moderately active stars with G8-K5 spectral types, all of
which exhibit a narrow peak in emission measure near log T=6.6, indicating that
the coronal heating process in these stars has a strong preference for this
temperature. As is the case for the Sun and many other stars, our sample of
stars shows coronal abundance anomalies dependent on the first ionization
potential (FIP) of the element. We see no dependence of the degree of ""FIP
effect"" on activity, but there is a dependence on spectral type, a correlation
that becomes more convincing when moderately active main sequence stars with a
broader range of spectral types are considered. This clear dependence of
coronal abundances on spectral type weakens if the stellar sample is allowed to
be contaminated by evolved stars, interacting binaries, or extremely active
stars with log L_X>29, explaining why this correlation has not been recognized

redshift z ~ 0.21 and are separated by 0.26 deg. Signatures of mergers have
been previously found in these clusters, both in X-rays and at
opticalwavelengths, thus motivating our study. In X-rays, they are relatively
bright, and Abell 223 shows a double structure. A filament has also been
detected between the clusters both at optical and X-ray wavelengths. We analyse
the optical properties of these two clusters based on deep imaging in two
bands, derive their galaxy minosity functions (GLFs) and correlate these
properties with X-ray characteristics derived from XMM-Newton data. The GLFs of
Abell 222 in the g' and r' bands are well fit by a Schechter function; the GLF
is steeper in r' than in g'. For Abell 223, the GLFs in both bands require a
second component at bright magnitudes, added to a Schechter function; they are
similar in both bands. The Serna & Gerbal method allows to separate well the
two clusters. No obvious filamentary structures are detected at very large
scales around the clusters, but a third cluster at the same redshift, Abell
209, is located at a projected distance of 19.2 Mpc. X-ray temperature and
metallicity maps reveal that the temperature and metallicity of the X-ray gas
are quite homogeneous in Abell 222, while they are very perturbed in Abell 223.
The Abell 222/Abell 223 system is complex. The two clusters that form this
structure present very different dynamical states. Signs of recent interactions
are also detected in the optical data where this cluster shows a ``perturbed''
GLF. In summary, the multiwavelength analyses of Abell 222 and Abell 223 are
used to investigate the connection between the ICM and the cluster galaxy
properties in an interacting system.

Here we study the form of the surface terms of the action for general

asymptotically flat space-times. We show that the contribution to the
symplectic structure from the Holst term vanishes and one obtains the same
asymptotic expressions as in the Palatini action. It then follows that the
asymptotic Poincare symmetries and conserved quantities such as energy, linear

consider the Euclidean approach to black hole thermodynamics and show that the

deep imaging in the F475W and F814W passbands. Although our survey was
interrupted by the ACS instrument failure in 2007, the partially completed

were performed for 25 fields that extend over a wide range of cluster-centric
radii (~1.75 Mpc) with a total coverage area of 274 arcmin^2. The majority of
the fields are located near the core region of Coma (19/25 pointings) with six
additional fields in the south-west region of the cluster. In this paper we
present reprocessed images and SExtractor source catalogs for our survey
fields, including a detailed description of the methodology used for object
detection and photometry, the subtraction of bright galaxies to measure faint
underlying objects, and the use of simulations to assess the photometric
accuracy and completeness of our catalogs. We also use simulations to perform
aperture corrections for the SExtractor Kron magnitudes based only on the
measured source flux and half-light radius. We have performed photometry for
~73,000 unique objects; one-half of our detections are brighter than the
10-sigma point-source detection limit at F814W=25.8 mag (AB). The slight
majority of objects (60%) are unresolved or only marginally resolved by ACS. We
estimate that Coma members are 5-10% of all source detections, which consist of
a large population of unresolved objects (primarily GCs but also UCDs) and a
wide variety of extended galaxies from a cD galaxy to dwarf LSB galaxies. The

discrete ejections, we applied a plasmon model to the radio data, with good
agreement with the lightcurves. We fitted a total of 687 radio flares with a

thus rather peaked, while that of the amplitude not.
  Regarding radio and X-ray links, this study confirms previous observations on

followed by radio flares. A strong correlation is found between the length of

subsequent radio oscillations. A model of an exponential rise of the form L_{15

this modification, the relevant coefficient turns out to be proportional to the

birefringence of gravitational waves, whereby left and right
circularly-polarized waves propagate at the same speed but with different
amplitude evolution. Here we propose a test of this effect through coincident
observations of gravitational waves and short gamma-ray bursts from binary
mergers involving neutron stars. Such gravitational waves are highly left or
right circularly-polarized due to the geometry of the merger. Using
localization information from the gamma-ray burst, ground-based gravitational
wave detectors can measure the distance to the source with reasonable accuracy.
An electromagnetic determination of the redshift from an afterglow or host
galaxy yields an independent measure of this distance. Gravitational parity
violation would manifest itself as a discrepancy between these two distance
measurements. We exemplify such a test by considering one specific effective
theory that leads to such gravitational parity-violation, Chern-Simons gravity.
We show that the advanced LIGO-Virgo network and all-sky gamma-ray telescopes
can be sensitive to the propagating sector of Chern-Simons gravitational parity
violation to a level roughly two orders of magnitude better than current

EeV-10EeV in the composition of Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs), from

heavier composition on the sources of UHECRs. The smaller magnetic rigidity
implies that nuclei UHECRs are: (i) More easily accelerated (ii) Local, as they
can diffuse only a few Mpc from their sources before disintegrating (iii)
Isotropic, because large deflections in the extra galactic and the galactic
magnetic fields erase the directional information. Uncertainties in the
strength and structure of the the extra galactic magnetic field (EGMF) makes it
difficult to estimate the overall effects. However, with typical reasonable
parameters of a few nG and a coherence distance of a Mpc the distance a nuclei
UHECR above the GZK energy traverses before photodisintegrating is only a few
Mpc. In spite of the significantly weaker limits on the luminosity, Cen A is
the only currently active potential source of nuclei UHECRs within this
distance. The large deflections erases the directional anisotropy expected from
a single source. If indeed the composition of above-GZK-UHECRs is iron and if

theories of competing orders which ignore Fermi surface effects. For
Ising-nematic order, the shift from Fermi surface effects remains of order
|Delta|^2. We discuss implications of these results for the phase diagrams of

of the Milky Way in 5 bands. We outline our data reduction strategy and present
some science highlights on the two observed 2{\deg} x 2{\deg} tiles
approximately centered at l=30{\deg} and l=59{\deg}. The two regions are
extremely rich in intense and highly structured extended emission which shows a
widespread organization in filaments. Source SEDs can be built for hundreds of
objects in the two fields, and physical parameters can be extracted, for a good
fraction of them where the distance could be estimated. The compact sources
(which we will call 'cores' in the following) are found for the most part to be
associated with the filaments, and the relationship to the local beam-averaged
column density of the filament itself shows that a core seems to appear when a
threshold around A_V of about 1 is exceeded for the regions in the l=59{\deg}
field; a A_V value between 5 and 10 is found for the l=30{\deg} field, likely
due to the relatively larger distances of the sources. This outlines an
exciting scenario where diffuse clouds first collapse into filaments, which
later fragment to cores where the column density has reached a critical level.
In spite of core L/M ratios being well in excess of a few for many sources, we
find core surface densities between 0.03 and 0.5 g cm-2. Our results are in
good agreement with recent MHD numerical simulations of filaments forming from
large-scale converging flows.

electronic structure calculations is presented. These basis sets consist of
atomic natural orbitals from a multi-configurational self-consistent field
calculation supplemented with primitive functions, chosen such that the
asymptotics are appropriate for the potential of the system. Primitives are
optimized for the homonuclear diatomic molecule to produce a balanced basis
set. Two general features that facilitate this basis construction are
demonstrated. First, weak coupling exists between the optimal exponents of
primitives with different angular momenta. Second, the optimal primitive
exponents for a chosen system depend weakly on the particular level of theory
employed for optimization. The explicit case considered here is a basis set
appropriate for the Burkatzki-Filippi-Dolg pseudopotentials. Since these
pseudopotentials are finite at nuclei and have a Coulomb tail, the recently
proposed Gauss-Slater functions are the appropriate primitives. Double- and
triple-zeta bases are developed for elements hydrogen through argon. These new
bases offer significant gains over the corresponding Burkatzki-Filippi-Dolg
bases at various levels of theory. Using a Gaussian expansion of the basis
functions, these bases can be employed in any electronic structure method.
Quantum Monte Carlo provides an added benefit: expansions are unnecessary since
the integrals are evaluated numerically.

searches of similar systems by upcoming missions. Using cross-correlation
methods with artificial signals implanted in the data, we find that our
detection limit corresponds to a relative Trojan transit depth of 1\times10-4,
equivalent to ~1 lunar mass of asteroids, assuming power-law Trojan size
distributions similar to Jupiter's Trojans in our solar system. We confirm with
dynamical interpretations that some asteroids could have migrated inward with
the planet to its current orbit at 0.045 AU, and that the Yarkovsky effect is
ineffective at eliminating objects of > 1 m in size. However, using numerical
models of collisional evolution we find that, due to high relative speeds in
this confined Trojan environment, collisions destroy the vast majority of the
asteroids in <10 Myr. Our modeling indicates that the best candidates to search
for exoTrojan swarms in 1:1 mean resonance orbits with ""hot Jupiters"" are young

which improves on previous studies of this young cluster by incorporating a
rigorous standardization procedure, thus providing high-fidelity colors and
magnitudes for cluster members. We use this new photometric dataset to
reevaluate the properties (age and distance) of IC4665. Namely, using a
statistical approach incorporating Tau^2 CMD modeling, we measure a
pre-main-sequence isochrone age and distance of 36+-9 Myr and 360+-12 pc, as
well as a upper-main-sequence turn-off age and distance of 42+-12 Myr and
357+-12 pc. These ages and distances are highly dependent on the isochrone
model and color used for the fitting procedure, with a possible range of ~10-20
Myr in age and ~20 pc in distance. This spread in calculated ages and distances
seen between colors and models is likely due to limitations in the individual
membership catalogs and/or systematic differences in the predicted stellar
parameters from the different sets of models. Interestingly, when we compare
the isochrone ages for IC4665 to the published lithium depletion boundary age,
28+-5 Myr, we observe that this cluster does not appear to follow the trend of
isochrone ages being 1.5 times smaller than lithium depletion boundary ages. In
addition, comparing the overall magnetic activity (X-ray and H-alpha emission)
in IC4665 with other well studied open clusters, we find the observed activity
distributions for this young cluster are best characterized by assuming an age
of 30-40 Myr, thus in agreement with our pre-main-sequence and turn-off
isochrone ages for IC4665. Overall, although some age discrepancies do exist,
particularly in the ages measured from pre-main-sequence isochrones, the range
of possible IC4665 ages derived from the various dating techniques employed
here is relatively small compared to that found for other well studied open
clusters.

Groth Strip whose spectral energy distributions fit a red power law from 3.6 to
8.0 \micron. The median for sources with known redshift is <z>=1.6. Though all
or nearly all of the sample are likely to be active galactic nuclei, only 33%
were detected in the EGS X-ray survey (AEGIS-X) using 200 ks Chandra
observations. The detected sources are X-ray luminous with L_X > 10^43 erg/s
and moderately to heavily obscured with N_H > 10^22 cm^-2. Stacking the
X-ray-undetected sample members yields a statistically significant X-ray
signal, suggesting that they are on average more distant or more obscured than
sources with X-ray detections. The ratio of X-ray to mid-infrared fluxes
suggests that a substantial fraction of the sources undetected in X-rays are
obscured at the Compton-thick level, in contrast to the X-ray-detected sources,
all of which appear to be Compton-thin. For the X-ray-detected power-law
sources with redshifts, an X-ray luminosity L_X ~ 10^44 erg/s marks a
transition between low-luminosity, blue sources dominated by the host galaxy to
high-luminosity, red power-law sources dominated by nuclear activity.
X-ray-to-optical ratios, infrared variability, and 24 micron properties of the
sample are consistent with the identification of infrared power-law sources as
active nuclei, but a rough estimate is that only 22% of AGNs are selected by
the power law criteria. Comparison of the power-law selection technique and
various IRAC color criteria for identifying AGNs confirms that high-redshift
samples selected via simple IRAC colors may be heavily contaminated by
starlight-dominated objects.

primordial magnetic field, generated by a causal process, such as a first order
phase transition in the early universe. As for the topological defects case, we
apply the general relativistic junction conditions to match the perturbation
variables before and after the phase transition, in such a way that the total
energy momentum tensor is conserved across the transition. We find that the
relevant contribution to the magnetic Sachs Wolfe effect comes from the metric
perturbations at next-to-leading order in the large scale limit. The leading
order term is strongly suppressed due to the presence of free-streaming
neutrinos. We derive the neutrino compensation effect and confirm that the
magnetic Sachs Wolfe spectrum from a causal magnetic field behaves as
l(l+1)C_l^B ~ l^2 as found in the latest numerical analyses.

so far known to provide no gain in memoryless point-to-point channels and only
bounded additive gain in multiple access channels. The gain comes from using
feedback to maximize resource utilization, thereby enabling more efficient
resource sharing between the interfering users. The result makes use of a

information and quantum communication processes. Developments in these fields
normally assume these resources stable and not susceptible of distortion. That
is not always the case, Heisenberg interactions between qubits can produce
distortion on entangled pairs generated for engineering purposes (e. g. for
quantum computation or quantum cryptography). Experimental work shows how to
produce entangled spin qubits in quantum dots and electron gases, so its
identification and control are crucial for later applications. The presence of
parasite magnetic fields modifies the expected properties and behavior for
which the pair was intended. Quantum measurement and control help to
discriminate the original state in order to correct it or, just to try of
reconstruct it using some procedures which do not alter their quantum nature.
  Two different kinds of quantum entangled pairs driven by a Heisenberg
Hamiltonian with an additional inhomogeneous magnetic field which becoming
self-distorted, can be reconstructed without previous discrimination by adding
an external magnetic field, with fidelity close to 1 (with respect to the
original state, but without discrimination). After, each state can be more
efficiently discriminated. The aim of this work is to show how combining both
processes, first reconstruction without discrimination and after discrimination
with adequate non-local measurements, it's possible a) improve the
discrimination, and b) reprepare faithfully the original states. The complete
process gives fidelities better than 0.9. In the meanwhile, some results about
a class of equivalence for the required measurements were found. This property
lets us select the adequate measurement in order to ease the repreparation
after of discrimination, without loss of entanglement.

as a condensate wave function, we introduce vortices as topological excitations
with quantized phase winding, and we show how phase slips occur when vortices
cross the sample. Superconductors exhibit non-zero electrical resistance under
circumstances where phase slips occur at a finite rate. For one-dimensional
superconductors or Josephson junctions, phase slips can occur at isolated
points in space-time. Phase slip rates may be controlled by thermal activation
over a free-energy barrier, or in some circumstances, at low temperatures, by
quantum tunneling through a barrier. We present an overview of several
phenomena involving vortices that have direct implications for the electrical
resistance of superconductors, including the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless
transition for vortex-proliferation in thin films, and the effects of vortex
pinning in bulk type II superconductors on the non-linear resistivity of these
materials in an applied magnetic field. We discuss how quantum fluctuations can
cause phase slips and review the non-trivial role of dissipation on such

adapts to a large environmental change. In particular, genomic surveys indicate
that, following the transition to an obligate, host-dependent symbiont, the

evolutionary time. Here, we show that these observations can be accounted for
by a class of generic stochastic models for the evolution of genomes in the
presence of continuous selection and gene duplication. The models use a fitness
function that allows for partial contributions from multiple gene copies, is an
increasing but bounded function of copy number, and is optimal for one fully
adapted gene copy. We use Monte Carlo simulation to show that the dynamics
result in an initial rise in gene copy number followed by a subsequent fall due
to adaptation to the new environmental parameters. These results are robust for
reasonable gene duplication and mutation parameters when adapting to a novel

degenerate. We show that mass and mixing of light neutrinos can be explained in
this case. Significant entropy release can be generated in a reheating produced
by the decay of one of the GeV scale $\nu_{R}$. The density of $\nu_{R1}$ DM
can be diluted by two orders of magnitude and the mixing of $\nu_{R1}$ with
active neutrinos is allowed to be much larger, reaching the bound from X-ray
observation. This mixing can lead to sizeable rate of $\nu_{R1}$ capture by
radioactive nuclei. The $\nu_{R1}$ capture events are mono-energetic electrons
with keV scale energy away from the beta decay spectrum. This is a new way to
detect DM in the universe.

the black hole are far from having a spherical geometry (as sometimes assumed),
instead they have a strongly elongated and cometary shape, with a dense head
(n=10^11 cm^-3) and an expanding, dissolving tail. We infer that the cometary
tails must be longer than a few times 10^13 cm and their opening angle must be
smaller than a few degrees. We suggest that the cometary shape may be a common
feature of BLR clouds in general, but which has been difficult to recognize
observationally so far. The cometary shape may originate from shocks and
hydrodynamical instabilities generated by the supersonic motion of the BLR
clouds into the intracloud medium. As a consequence of the mass loss into their
tail, we infer that the BLR clouds probably have a lifetime of only a few
months, implying that they must be continuously replenished. We also find a
large, puzzling discrepancy (two orders of magnitude) between the mass of the
BLR inferred from the properties of the absorbing clouds and the mass of the

found that the response of the harmonic oscillator to periodic GW, when their

TeV gamma-rays, and a SNR G12.8-0.0 was identified in the radio band to be
associated with it. The PWN embedded in the SNR is powered by an energetic
pulsar PSR J1813-1749, which was recently discovered. Whether the TeV
gamma-rays originate from the SNR shell or the PWN is uncertain now. We
investigate theoretically the multiwavelength nonthermal radiation from the
composite SNR G12.8-0.0. The emission from the particles accelerated in the SNR
shell is calculated based on a semianalytical method to the nonlinear diffusive
shock acceleration mechanism. In the model, the magnetic field is
self-generated via resonant streaming instability, and the dynamical reaction
of the field on the shock is taken into account. Based on a model which couples
the dynamical and radiative evolution of a PWN in a non-radiative SNR, the
dynamics and the multi-band emission of the PWN are investigated. The particles
are injected with a spectrum of a relativistic Maxwellian plus a power law
high-energy tail with an index of -2.5. Our results indicate that the radio
emission from the shell can be well reproduced as synchrotron radiation of the
electrons accelerated by the SNR shock; with an ISM number density of 1.4
cm^{-3} for the remnant, the gamma-ray emission from the SNR shell is
insignificant, and the observed X-rays and VHE gamma-rays from the source are
consistent with the emission produced by electrons/positrons injected in the
PWN via synchrotron radiation and IC scattering, respectively; the resulting
gamma-ray flux for the shell is comparable to the detected one only with a
relatively larger density of about 2.8 cm^{-3}. The VHE gamma-rays of HESS
J1813-178 can be naturally explained to mainly originate from the nebula
although the contribution of the SNR shell becomes significant with a denser
ambient medium.

a metric on the space of states, pioneered by Ruppeiner and Weinhold, has
proved to be a useful alternative approach to characterizing phase transitions.
Some puzzling anomalies become apparent, however, when these methods are
applied to the study of black hole thermodynamics. A possible resolution was
suggested by Quevedo et al. who emphasized the importance of Legendre
invariance in thermodynamic metrics. They found physically consistent results
for various black holes when using a Legendre invariant metric, which agreed
with a direct determination of the properties of phase transitions from the
specific heat.
  Recently, information geometric methods have been employed by Wei et al. to
study the Kehagias-Sfetsos (KS) black hole in Horava-Lifshitz gravity. The
formalism suggests that a coupling parameter in this theory plays a role
analogous to the charge in Reissner-Nordstrom (RN) black holes or angular
momentum in the Kerr black hole and calculation of the specific heat shows a
singularity which may be interpreted as a phase transition. When the curvature
of the Ruppeiner metric is calculated for such a theory it does not, however,
show a singularity at the phase transition point.
  We show that the curvature of a particular Legendre invariant (""Quevedo"")
metric for the KS black hole is singular at the phase transition point. We
contrast the results for the Ruppeiner, Weinhold and Quevedo metrics and in the
latter case investigate the consistency of taking either the entropy or mass as

frequent outbursts. Although our coverage is not uniform, our observations are
consistent with the outbursts recurring on a timescale of ~60 days.
Observations made using Swift show that the outbursts occur with a similar
amplitude at both UV and optical energies and a duration of 2 weeks. Although
KL Dra is a weak X-ray source we find no significant evidence that the X-ray
flux varies over the course of an outburst cycle. We can reproduce the main
features of the 60 day outburst cycle using the Disc Instability Model and a
helium-dominated accretion flow. Although the outbursts of KL Dra are very
similar to those of the hydrogen accreting dwarf novae, we cannot exclude that
they are the AM CVn equivalent of WZ Sge type outbursts. With outbursts
occurring every ~2 months, KL Dra is an excellent target to study
helium-dominated accretion flows in general.

fundamental property of flux tube models. A rapid expansion is required to form
a magnetic canopy. Aims: We characterize the observed expansion properties of
magnetic network elements and compare them with the thin flux tube and sheet
approximations, as well as with magnetoconvection simulations. Methods: We used
data from the Hinode SOT NFI NaD1 channel and spectropolarimeter to study the
appearance of magnetic flux concentrations seen in circular polarization as a
function of position on the solar disk. We compared the observations with
synthetic observables from models based on the thin flux tube approximation and
magnetoconvection simulations with two different upper boundary conditions for
the magnetic field (potential and vertical). Results: The observed circular
polarization signal of magnetic flux concentrations changes from unipolar at
disk center to bipolar near the limb, which implies an expanding magnetic
field. The observed expansion agrees with expansion properties derived from the
thin flux sheet and tube approximations. Magnetoconvection simulations with a
potential field as the upper boundary condition for the magnetic field also
produce bipolar features near the limb while a simulation with a vertical field
boundary condition does not. Conclusions: The near-limb apparent bipolar
magnetic features seen in high-resolution Hinode observations can be
interpreted using a simple flux sheet or tube model. This lends further support
to the idea that magnetic features with vastly varying sizes have similar
relative expansion rates. The numerical simulations presented here are less
useful in interpreting the expansion since the diagnostics we are interested in
are strongly influenced by the choice of the upper boundary condition for the
magnetic field in the purely photospheric simulations.

at ~1 kpc. We made new molecular observations toward the dense cloud cores,
peaks A, C and D, in the SNR in the 12CO(J=2-1) and 13CO(J=2-1) transitions at
angular resolution of 90"". The most intense core in 13CO, peak C, was also
mapped in the 12CO(J=4-3) transition at angular resolution of 38"". Peak C shows
strong signs of active star formation including bipolar outflow and a
far-infrared protostellar source and has a steep gradient with a
r^{-2.2$\pm$0.4} variation in the average density within radius r. Peak C and
the other dense cloud cores are rim-brightened in synchrotron X rays,
suggesting that the dense cloud cores are embedded within or on the outer
boundary of the SNR shell. This confirms the earlier suggestion that the X rays
are physically associated with the molecular gas (Fukui et al. 2003). We
present a scenario where the densest molecular core, peak C, survived against
the blast wave and is now embedded within the SNR. Numerical simulations of the
shock-cloud interaction indicate that a dense clump can indeed survive shock
erosion, since shock propagation speed is stalled in the dense clump.
Additionally, the shock-cloud interaction induces turbulence and magnetic field
amplification around the dense clump that may facilitate particle acceleration
in the lower-density inter-clump space leading to the enhanced synchrotron X
rays around dense cores.

Sun,
Galaxy (and Jupiter) gravitationally act on the comets. New physical model of
galactic tide is considered. The main results can be summarized as follows:
  1. Mass of the Oort cloud of comets is less than 1 mass of the Earth
($M_{E}$), probably not greater than 1/2 $M_{E}$.
  2. Theoretical number of long-period comets with perihelion distance $q$ $<$
5 AU is about 50-times greater than the conventional approach yields. Gravity
of Jupiter was taken into account in finding this result.
  3. Semi-major axis $a$ and period of oscillations $P$ of eccentricity (and
other orbital elements) are related as $a^{3}$ $P$ $=$ 1 in natural units for a
moving Solar System in the Galaxy. The natural unit for time is the orbital
period of the Solar System revolution around the galactic center and the
natural unit for measuring the semi-major axis is its maximum value for the
half-radius of the Solar System corresponding to the half-radius of the Oort
cloud. The relation holds for the cases when comets approach the inner part of
the Solar System, e.g., perihelion distances are less than $\approx$ 100 AU.
  4. The minimum value of semi-major axis for the Oort cloud is $a_{min}$ $\ll$
1 $\times$ 10$^{4}$ AU. This condition was obtained both from the numerical
results on cometary evolution under the action of the galactic tides and from
the observational distribution of long-period comets. If the density function
of semi-major axis is approximated by proportionality $a^{\alpha}$, then
$\alpha$ is - 1/2, approximately.
  5. The magnitude of the change in perihelion distance per orbit, $\Delta q$,
of a comet due to galactic tides is a strong function of semi-major axis $a$,
proportional to $a^{8.25}$.

helicity injection in an active region is related to the occurrence and

are analyzed using $SOHO$/MDI magnetograms. The 24-hour averaged helicity
injection rate and unsigned magnetic flux are compared with the flare index and
the flare-productive probability in next 24 hours following an measurement. In
addition, we study the variation of helicity over a span of several days around
the times of the 19 flares above M5.0 which occurred in selected strong
flare-productive active regions. The major findings of this study are: (1) for
a sub-sample of 91 large active regions with unsigned magnetic fluxes in the
range from 3 to 5 $\times$ 10$^{22}$ Mx, there is a difference in magnetic
helicity injection rate between flaring active regions and non-flaring active
regions by a factor of 2; (2) the $GOES$ C-flare-productive probability as a
function of helicity injection displays a sharp boundary between
flare-productive active regions and flare-quiet ones; (3) the history of
helicity injection before all the 19 major flares displayed a common
characteristic: a significant helicity accumulation of (3-45)$ \times$ 10
$^{42}$ Mx$^2$ during a phase of monotonically increasing helicity over 0.5 to
2 days. Our results support the notion that helicity injection is important in
flares, but it is not effective to use it alone for the purpose of flare
forecast. It is necessary to find a way to better characterize the time history
of helicity injection as well as its spatial distribution inside active
regions.

technologies that are defined for accelerated electron energies reaching as
high as PeV. These parameters are carved out from the scaling laws that govern
the physics of laser acceleration, theoretically suggested and experimentally
explored over a wide range in the recent years. We extrapolate this knowledge
toward PeV energies. In the density regime on the order of 10^16 cm^-3, it is
possible to consider the application of the existing NIF (or LMJ) or its
extended lasers to their appropriate retrofitting for this purpose. Although
the ambition of luminosity is not pursued, such energies by themselves may
allow us to begin to feel and study the physics of the 'texture of vacuum'.
This is an example of fundamental physics exploration without the need of
luminosity paradigm. By converting accelerated electrons with extreme energies
to like energy gamma photons, and let them propagate through vacuum over a
sufficient distance, these extremely high energy (and therefore short
wavelength) photons experience smallest vacuum structures and fluctuations. If
we can measure the arrival time differential and thus the gamma photon speed as
a function of different energies such as 0.1 PeV vs 1 PeV, say within
attoseconds accuracy, we can collect valuable data if and how gamma photons
still obeys the premise of relativity or the vacuum texture begins to alter
such fundamentals. The only method currently available to look at this problem
may be to study astrophysical data of the primordial gamma ray bursts (GRBs),
which are compared with the presently suggested approach.

speed increasing from 130+/-14 km/s just above the limb, to 330+/-140 km/s

from a bright region of the on-disk part of the coronal hole where the
propagation speed was found to be in the range of 25+/-1.3 to 38+/-4.5 km/s,
with the same periodicity. These on-disk bright regions can be visualized as

propagation speeds in the range of 135+/-18 to 165+/-43 km/s only. To our
knowledge, this result provides first spectroscopic evidence of acceleration of
propagating disturbances in the polar region close to the Sun (within 1.2 solar

allowing the propagation of the transverse spin 1/2 component present in the
reducible Rarita-Schwinger vector-spinor. This is done by allowing a more
general form for the mass term, while leaving the kinetic terms untouched. We
find that the interaction is consistent and does not lead to superluminal
propagation for a range of the mass parameter where the spin 1/2 component is
lighter than the spin 3/2 component, in contrast to the traditional value
whereby the spin 1/2 component is removed by making it infinitely massive. The
hyperbolicity condition is found to be independent of the magnitude of the
electromagnetic field, and the canonically quantized field is constructed to be
causal. We then provide appropriate projection operators which reproduce the
spin-sum expressions and enable the construction of a physically acceptable
propagator. Finally, we suggest a scheme for extension of the Standard Model
with Rarita-Schwinger multiplets and identify the muon as the spin 1/2
component of the new multiplet which in addition contains a new, heavy partner
of the muon of spin 3/2. The scattering cross-section e+, e- \to {\mu}+, {\mu}-

subdwarf B star V391 Pegasi with the timing method, indicating that a
previously undiscovered population of substellar companions to apparently
single subdwarf B stars might exist. Following this serendipitous discovery,
the EXOTIME (http://www.na.astro.it/~silvotti/exotime/) monitoring program has
been set up to follow the pulsations of a number of selected rapidly pulsating
subdwarf B stars on time-scales of several years with two immediate
observational goals:
  1) determine Pdot of the pulsational periods P
  2) search for signatures of substellar companions in O-C residuals due to
periodic light travel time variations, which would be tracking the central
star's companion-induced wobble around the center of mass.
  These sets of data should therefore at the same time: on the one hand be
useful to provide extra constraints for classical asteroseismological exercises
from the Pdot (comparison with ""local"" evolutionary models), and on the other
hand allow to investigate the preceding evolution of a target in terms of
possible ""binary"" evolution by extending the otherwise unsuccessful search for
companions to potentially very low masses. While timing pulsations may be an
observationally expensive method to search for companions, it samples a
different range of orbital parameters, inaccessible through orbital photometric
effects or the radial velocity method: the latter favours massive close-in
companions, whereas the timing method becomes increasingly more sensitive
towards wider separations. In this paper we report on the status of the
on-going observations and coherence analysis for two of the currently five
targets, revealing very well-behaved pulsational characteristics in HS
0444+0458, while showing HS 0702+6043 to be more complex than previously

In this new approach, we make explicit and decouple the timescales associated
(a) with disruptive effects the star formation event itself, from (b) the
timescales associated with the cloud assembly and collapse mechanisms leading
up to star formation. The star formation law in near-by galaxies, as measured
on sub-kiloparsec scales, has recently been shown by Bigiel et al. to be
distinctly non-linear in its dependence on total gas density. Our
parameterization of the spatially resolved Schmidt-Sanduleak relation naturally
accommodates that dependence. The parameterized form of the relation is rho_* ~
epsilon x rho_g/(tau_s + rho_g ^{-n}), where rho_g is the gas density, epsilon
is the efficiency of converting gas into stars, and rho_g^{-n} captures the
physics of cloud collapse. Accordingly at high gas densities quiescent star
formation is predicted to progress as rho_* ~ rho_g, while at low gas densities
rho_* ~ rho_g^{1+n}, as is now generally observed. A variable efficiency in
locally converting gas into stars as well as the unknown plane thickness
variations from galaxy to galaxy, and radially within a given galaxy, can
readily account for the empirical scatter in the observed (surface density
rather than volume density) relations, and also plausibly account for the noted
upturn in the relation at very high apparent projected column densities.

non-monotonic: for some networks, increasing transmissibility actually
decreases the final extent. The dynamics of 2FleeSIR are fundamentally

dust grains with ~70 K at radii larger than 50 AU, as suggested by blackbody

different design techniques, when applied to these problems, can produce
algorithms that are I/O efficient. This thesis adds to the growing chorus of
such results. The computational models we use are the external memory model and
the W-Stream model.
  On the external memory model, we obtain the following results. (1) An I/O
efficient algorithm for computing minimum spanning trees of graphs that
improves on the performance of the best known algorithm. (2) The first external
memory version of soft heap, an approximate meldable priority queue. (3) Hard
heap, the first meldable external memory priority queue that matches the
amortised I/O performance of the known external memory priority queues, while
allowing a meld operation at the same amortised cost. (4) I/O efficient exact,
approximate and randomised algorithms for the minimum cut problem, which has
not been explored before on the external memory model. (5) Some lower and upper
bounds on I/Os for interval graphs.
  On the W-Stream model, we obtain the following results. (1) Algorithms for
various tree problems and list ranking that match the performance of the best
known algorithms and are easier to implement than them. (2) Pass efficient
algorithms for sorting, and the maximal independent set problems, that improve
on the best known algorithms. (3) Pass efficient algorithms for the graphs
problems of finding vertex-colouring, approximate single source shortest paths,
maximal matching, and approximate weighted vertex cover. (4) Lower bounds on
passes for list ranking and maximal matching.
  We propose two variants of the W-Stream model, and design algorithms for the
maximal independent set, vertex-colouring, and planar graph single source
shortest paths problems on those models.

accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar Swift J1749.4-2807. This is the first
detection of X-ray eclipses in a system of this type and should enable a
precise neutron star mass measurement once the companion star is identified and
studied. We present a combined pulse and eclipse timing solution that enables
tight constraints on the orbital parameters and inclination and shows that the
companion mass is in the range 0.6-0.8 M_sun for a likely range of neutron star
masses, and that it is larger than a main sequence star of the same mass. We
observed two individual eclipse egresses and a single ingress. Our timing model
shows that the eclipse features are symmetric about the time of 90 deg
longitude from the ascending node, as expected. Our eclipse timing solution
gives an eclipse duration (from the mid-points of ingress to egress) of 2172
+/- 13 s. This represents 6.85% of the 8.82 hr orbital period. This system also
presents a potential measurement of ""Shapiro"" delay due to General Relativity;
through this technique alone, we set an upper limit to the companion mass of
2.2 M_sun.

interrupted by Josephson junctions as a basis for quantum bit, flux qubit,
presumes the assumption on superposition of two macroscopically distinct
quantum states with macroscopically different angular momentum. The
contradiction of this assumption with macroscopic realism and the conservation
law must call the numerous publications about flux qubit in question. These
publications uncover misunderstanding by many modern physicists of the essence
of the superposition principle. The Einstein - Podolsky - Rosen (EPR)
correlation or entanglement, introduced in 1935 by opponents of the Copenhagen
interpretation in order to reveal the contradiction of this principle with
realism, has provided a basis of the idea of quantum computation. The problem
of the EPR correlation has emerged thanks to philosophical controversy between
the creators of the quantum theory about the subject of its description.
Therefore it is impossible to solve correctly the problem of quantum computer
creation without the insight into the essence of this philosophical
controversy. The total neglect of the philosophical problems of quantum
foundation results to concrete mistakes, the example of which are the
publications about flux qubit. In order to prevent such mistakes in the future
the philosophical questions about the essence of superposition and entanglement
and about the subject of quantum description are considered.

simulation of crowds in the ancient Greek agora of Argos. This place was a
social theater in which two kinds of collective phenomena took place:
interpersonal interactions (small group discussion and negotiation, etc.) and
global collective phenomena, such as flowing and jamming. In this paper, we
focus on the second type of collective human phenomena, called non-deliberative
emergent crowd phenomena. This is a typical case of collective emergent
self-organization. When a great number of individuals move within a confined
environment and under a common fate, collective structures appear
spontaneously: jamming with inner collapses, organized flowing with queues,
curls, and vortices, propagation effects, etc. These are particularly relevant
features to enhance the realism - more precisely the ""truthfulness"" - of models
of this kind of collective phenomena. We assume that this truthfulness is
strongly associated with the concept of emergence: evolutions are not
predetermined by the individual characters, but emerge from the interaction of
numerous characters. The evolutions are not repetitive, and evolve on the basis
of small changes. This paper demonstrates that the physically-based interacting
particles system is an adequate candidate to model emergent crowd effects: it
associates a large number of elementary dynamic actors via elementary
non-linear dynamic interactions. Our model of the scene is regulated as a
large, dynamically coupled network of second order differential automata. We
take advantage of symbolic non-photorealistic and efficient visualization to
render the style of the person, rather than the person itself. As an artistic
representation, NPR reinforces the symbolic acceptance of the scene by the
observer, triggering an immediate and intuitive recognition of the scene as a
plausible scene from ancient Greece.
