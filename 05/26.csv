The observer needs to reach a compromise among spatial and spectral resolution,

can be pushed to the limit. Tunable filters and grating spectrographs provide a
natural compromise as the former are more suitable for high-spatial resolution
observations while the latter are a better choice when one needs to work with
many wavelengths at full spectral resolution. Given the requirements for the
new science targeted by these facilities, it is important that 1)tunable

and inhomogeneous roads have been analyzed in flux-density space with the
fundamental diagram of the flux-density relation. In this paper, we present a
new framework for analyzing the LWR model, especially the Riemann problem at a
linear boundary in which the upstream and downstream links are homogeneous and
initially carry uniform traffic. We first review the definitions of local
supply and demand functions and then introduce the so-called supply-demand
diagram, on which a traffic state can be represented by its supply and demand,
rather than as density and flux as on a fundamental diagram. It is well-known
that the solutions to the Riemann problem at each link are self-similar with a
stationary state, and that the wave on the link is determined by the stationary
state and the initial state. In our new framework, there can also exist an
interior state next to the linear boundary on each link, which takes
infinitesimal space, and admissible conditions for the upstream and downstream
stationary and interior states can be derived in supply-demand space. With an
entropy condition consistent with a local supply-demand method in interior
states, we show that the stationary states exist and are unique within the
solution framework. We also develop a graphical scheme for solving the Riemann
problem, and the results are shown to be consistent with those in the
literature. We further discuss asymptotic stationary states on an inhomogeneous
ring road with arbitrary initial conditions and demonstrate the existence of
interior states with a numerical example. The framework developed in this study
is simpler than existing ones and can be extended for analyzing the traffic
dynamics in general road networks.

residing inside galaxy clusters in the framework of modified Newtonian dynamics
(MOND), that could be used to test this paradigm. Apart from the central
brightest cluster galaxy, other galaxies close enough to the centre experience
a strong gravitational influence from the other galaxies of the cluster. This
influence manifests itself only as tides in standard Newtonian gravity, meaning
that the systematic acceleration of the centre of mass of the galaxy has no
consequence. However, in the context of MOND, a consequence of the breaking of
the strong equivalence principle is that the systematic acceleration changes
the own self-gravity of the galaxy. We show here that, in this framework,
initially axisymmetric elliptical galaxies become lopsided along the external
field's direction, and that the centroid of the galaxy, defined by the outer
density contours, is shifted by a few hundreds parsecs with respect to the
densest point.

commutativity. A Cat-operad is an operad enriched over the category Cat of
small categories, as a 2-category with small hom-categories is a category
enriched over Cat. The notion of weak Cat-operad is to the notion of Cat-operad
what the notion of bicategory is to the notion of 2-category. The equations of
operads like associativity of insertions are replaced by isomorphisms in a
category. The goal of this paper is to formulate conditions concerning these
isomorphisms that ensure coherence, in the sense that all diagrams of canonical
arrows commute. This is the sense in which the notions of monoidal category and
bicategory are coherent. The coherence proof in the paper is much simplified by
indexing the insertion operations in a context-independent way, and not in the
usual manner. This proof, which is in the style of term rewriting, involves an
argument with normal forms that generalizes what is established with the
completeness proof for the standard presentation of symmetric groups. This
generalization may be of an independent interest, and related to matters other
than those studied in this paper. Some of the coherence conditions for weak
Cat-operads lead to the hemiassociahedron, which is a polyhedron related to,

involve calculations with varying geometries which are inherently flawed, as
metamaterial properties depend strongly on geometry, or are more subjective as
one must inspect and select branches to yield effec- tive parameters as a

which hold for negative-index materials, naturally guide the selection of the
proper branches, and in fact predict negative refractive index where other
extraction procedures alone might not. The experimental realization of high

is a function taking integer values on the vertices of the torus with
consecutive integers assigned to adjacent vertices. A Lipschitz height function
is defined similarly but may also take equal values on adjacent vertices. In
each model, we consider the uniform distribution over such functions, subject
to boundary conditions. We prove that in high dimensions, with zero boundary
values, a typical function is very flat, having bounded variance at any fixed
vertex and taking at most $C(\log n)^{1/d}$ values with high probability. Our
results extend to any dimension $d\ge 2$, if $\mathbb{Z}_n^d$ is replaced by an
enhanced version of it, the torus $\mathbb{Z}_n^d\times\mathbb{Z}_2^{d_0}$ for
some fixed $d_0$. This establishes one side of a conjectured roughening
transition in $2$ dimensions. The full transition is established for a class of
tori with non-equal side lengths. We also find that when $d$ is taken to
infinity while $n$ remains fixed, a typical function takes at most $r$ values
with high probability, where $r=5$ for the homomorphism model and $r=4$ for the
Lipschitz model. Suitable generalizations are obtained when $n$ grows with $d$.
Our results apply also to the related model of uniform 3-coloring and
establish, for certain boundary conditions, that a uniformly sampled proper
3-coloring of $\mathbb{Z}_n^d$ will be nearly constant on either the even or
odd sub-lattice.
  Our proofs are based on a combinatorial transformation and on a careful
analysis of the properties of a class of cutsets which we term odd cutsets. For
the Lipschitz model, our results rely also on a bijection of Yadin. This work
generalizes results of Galvin and Kahn, refutes a conjecture of Benjamini,
Yadin and Yehudayoff and answers a question of Benjamini, H\""aggstr\""om and

oscillations with peak-to-trough amplitude of about 0.1 $^oC$ and 0.25 $^oC$,
and periods of about 20 and 60 years, respectively, are synchronized to the
orbital periods of Jupiter and Saturn. Schwabe and Hale solar cycles are also
visible in the temperature records. A 9.1-year cycle is synchronized to the
Moon's orbital cycles. A phenomenological model based on these astronomical
cycles can be used to well reconstruct the temperature oscillations since 1850

least 60\% of the global warming observed since 1970 has been induced by the
combined effect of the above natural climate oscillations. The partial forecast

$W^\pm \to \ell^\pm \nu_\ell$ ($\ell =e, \mu, \tau$), and analyse the

background from the decay $t \to W b$. To that end, we analyse the $V0$ ($K^0$

the energy and transverse momentum distributions of these particles. The $V0$s
emanating from the $t \to W b$ branch have displaced decay vertexes from the
interaction point due to the weak decays $b \to c \to s$ and the $b$-quark jets
are rich in charged leptons. Hence, the absence of secondary vertexes and of
the energetic charged leptons in the jet provide additional ($b$-jet vs.
$s$-jet) discrimination in top quark decays. These distributions are used to
train a boosted decision tree (BDT). Using the BDT classifier, and a variant of

efficiency and a background ($t \to W b$) rejection by a factor $10^3$

both area and angular distortions. If the angular distortion is bounded, the
mapping is called a {\it quasi-conformal} map. Many surface maps in our
physical world are quasi-conformal. The angular distortion of a quasi-conformal
map can be represented by Beltrami differentials. According to quasi-conformal
Teichm\""uller theory, there is an 1-1 correspondence between the set of
Beltrami differentials and the set of quasi-conformal surface maps. Therefore,
every quasi-conformal surface map can be fully determined by the Beltrami
differential and can be reconstructed by solving the so-called Beltrami
equation.
  In this work, we propose an effective method to solve the Beltrami equation
on general Riemann surfaces. The solution is a quasi-conformal map associated
with the prescribed Beltrami differential. We firstly formulate a discrete
analog of quasi-conformal maps on triangular meshes. Then, we propose an
algorithm to compute discrete quasi-conformal maps. The main strategy is to
define a discrete auxiliary metric of the source surface, such that the
original quasi-conformal map becomes conformal under the newly defined discrete
metric. The associated map can then be obtained by using the discrete Yamabe
flow method. Numerically, the discrete quasi-conformal map converges to the
continuous real solution as the mesh size approaches to 0. We tested our
algorithm on surfaces scanned from real life with different topologies.
Experimental results demonstrate the generality and accuracy of our auxiliary
metric method.

weighted to the high-field region of the plasma. An interaction between the
Faraday rotation and Cotton-Mouton effects is also clearly identified.
Elliptization occurs when the wave polarization direction is neither parallel
nor perpendicular to the local transverse magnetic field. Since Faraday
rotation modifies the polarization direction during propagation, it must also
affect the resultant elliptization. The Cotton-Mouton effect also intrinsically
results in rotation of the polarization direction, but this effect is less
significant in the plasma conditions modeled. The interaction increases at
longer wavelength, and complicates interpretation of polarimetry measurements.

defined using the pencil of circles whose common point (in the words of the
Nielsen-Fenchel manuscript is $\infty$. The orbits involved in this case are
closed and long - judged by arc length between two points compared to the
hyperbolic distance between them.
  We are concerned with tracking the paths of individual horocycles. Using Ford
circles of Farey sequences we find lifts to the Standard Fundamental Region
(SFR) and find points of these lifts making given angles with a horizontal.
Next, we offer two methods, both involving continued fractions, of locating
points with such angles whose lifts are near any given point in the SFR. This
establishes in an effective manner a sort of transitivity, which necessarily
involves infinitely many such horocycles.
  Next, we study the homotopy classes of horizontal horocycles as we descend to
the real axis. We find these are stable during descent between encounters of
the horizontal with elliptic fixed points. Such encounters change - complicate
- the homotopy classes. We give these explicitly down to height
$1/(2\sqrt{3})$.
  Finally we do an initial study of the open (infinite length) horocycle path
with unit euclidean radius anchored at $\phi -1$, where $\phi$ is the Golden
Mean. Enough information is adduced to suggest that this path is itself
transitive. The methods resemble the Hardy-Littlewood Circle Method in a
certain regard, albeit without the exponential sums.

of a wide range of statistical properties for classes of X-ray sources; and (3)
provides efficient access to calibrated observational data and ancillary data
products for individual X-ray sources, so that users can perform detailed

detected with flux estimates that are at least 3 times their estimated 1 sigma
uncertainties in at least one energy band, while maintaining the number of
spurious sources at a level of <~ 1 false source per field for a 100 ks

protoplanet, TMR-1C, that lies at a separation of about 10"" (~1000 AU) from the
Class I protobinary TMR-1 (IRAS 04361+2547) located in the Taurus molecular
cloud. A narrow filament-like structure was observed extending south-east from
the central proto-binary system towards TMR-1C, suggesting a morphology in
which the candidate protoplanet may have been ejected from the TMR-1 system.
Follow-up low-resolution spectroscopy by Terebey et al. 2000, however, could
not confirm if this object is a protoplanet or a low-luminosity background
star. We present two epochs of near-infrared photometric observations obtained
at the CFHT of TMR-1C. The time span of ~7 years between the two sets of
observations provides with an opportunity to, (a) check for any photometric
variability similar to that observed among young stellar objects, which would
indicate the youth of this source, and, (b) determine the proper motion. TMR-1C
displays large photometric variability between 1 and 2 mag in both the H- and
Ks-bands. From our 2002 observations, we find a (H-Ks) color of 0.3 mag, which
is much bluer than the value of 1.3 mag reported by T98 from HST observations.
Also, we observe brightening in both the H- and Ks-bands when the colors are
bluer, i.e. the object gets redder as it becomes fainter. We have explored the
possible origins for the observed variability, and find extinction due to the
presence of circumstellar material to be the most likely scenario. The observed
large-amplitude photometric variations, and the possible presence of a
circumstellar disk, are strong arguments against this object being an old
background star.

zero magnetic helicity, occupying a half-space, and study the problem of its
evolution driven by an imposed photospheric flux decrease. For this specific
setting of the Flux Cancellation Model describing coronal mass ejections
occuring in active regions, we address the issues of the physical meaning of
flux decrease, of the influence on field evolution of the size of the domain
over which this decrease is imposed, and of the existence of an energetic
criterion characterizing the possible onset of disruption of the configuration.
We show that: (1) The imposed flux disappearance can be interpreted in terms of
transport of positive and negative fluxes towards the inversion line, where
they get annihilated. (2) For the particular case actually computed, in which
the initial state is quite sheared, the formation of a twisted flux rope and
the subsequent global disruption of the configuration are obtained when the
flux has decreased by only a modest amount over a limited part of the whole
active region. (3) The disruption is produced when the magnetic energy becomes
of the order of the decreasing energy of a semi-open field, and then before
reaching the energy of the associated fully open field. This suggests that the
mechanism leading to the disruption is nonequilibrium as in the case where flux
is imposed to decrease over the whole region.

corresponding to energies around 6700K, while the highest detectable transition
is J=90-89 for SiO, which corresponds to an energy around 8400K. Both species
trace the dust formation zone of IRC+10216, and the broad energy ranges
involved in their detected transitions permit us to derive the physical
properties of the gas and the particular zone in which each species has been
formed. This allows us to check the accuracy of chemical thermodynamical

2009) we investigate star clusters of a few 10^4 Msun by means of velocity
dispersion profiles and surface density profiles. We use a comprehensive set of
$N$-body computations of star clusters on various orbits within a realistic
tidal field to study the evolution of these profiles with time, and ongoing
cluster dissolution From the velocity dispersion profiles we find that the
population of potential escapers, i.e. energetically unbound stars inside the
Jacobi radius, dominates clusters at radii above about 50% of the Jacobi
radius. Beyond 70% of the Jacobi radius nearly all stars are energetically
unbound. The velocity dispersion therefore significantly deviates from the
predictions of simple equilibrium models in this regime. We furthermore argue
that for this reason this part of a cluster cannot be used to detect a dark
matter halo or deviations from Newtonian gravity. By fitting templates to the
about 10^4 computed surface density profiles we estimate the accuracy which can
be achieved in reconstructing the Jacobi radius of a cluster in this way. We
find that the template of King (1962) works well for extended clusters on
nearly circular orbits, but shows significant flaws in the case of eccentric
cluster orbits. This we fix by extending this template with 3 more free
parameters. Our template can reconstruct the tidal radius over all fitted
ranges with an accuracy of about 10%, and is especially useful in the case of
cluster data with a wide radial coverage and for clusters showing significant
extra-tidal stellar populations. No other template that we have tried can yield
comparable results over this range of cluster conditions. All templates fail to
reconstruct tidal parameters of concentrated clusters, however. (abridged)

its relic density and indirect detection signals. We determine how large
indirect signals may be in scenarios with Sommerfeld-enhanced annihilation,
subject to the constraint that the dark matter has the correct relic density.
This work refines our previous analysis through detailed treatments of resonant
Sommerfeld enhancement and the effect of Sommerfeld enhancement on freeze out.
Sommerfeld enhancements raise many interesting issues in the freeze out
calculation, and we find that the cutoff of resonant enhancement, the
equilibration of force carriers, the temperature of kinetic decoupling, and the
efficiency of self-interactions for preserving thermal velocity distributions
all play a role. These effects may have striking consequences; for example, for
resonantly-enhanced Sommerfeld annihilation, dark matter freezes out but may
then chemically recouple, implying highly suppressed indirect signals, in
contrast to naive expectations. In the minimal scenario with standard
astrophysical assumptions, and tuning all parameters to maximize the signal, we
find that, for force-carrier mass m_phi = 250 MeV and dark matter masses m_X =
0.1, 0.3, and 1 TeV, the maximal Sommerfeld enhancement factors are S_eff = 7,
30, and 90, respectively. Such boosts are too small to explain both the PAMELA
and Fermi excesses. Non-minimal models may require smaller boosts, but the
bounds on S_eff could also be more stringent, and dedicated freeze out analyses
are required. For concreteness, we focus on 4 mu final states, but we also
discuss 4 e and other modes, deviations from standard astrophysical assumptions
and non-minimal particle physics models, and we outline the steps required to
determine if such considerations may lead to a self-consistent explanation of

  In this paper, we present a series of large scale hydrodynamical simulations
for LCDM and dynamical Dark Energy (dDE) models, in which the equation of state
parameter is z-dependent. The simulations include gas cooling, star formation
and Supernovae feedback. They closely approximate the observed star formation
rate and the observationally derived star/Dark Matter mass ratio in collapsed

previous studies, although we find a smaller effect (~50%) on the power
spectrum amplitude at higher k's. dDE exhibits similar behavior, even though
the dDE simulations produce ~20% less stars than the analogous LCDM
cosmologies. Finally, we show that the technique introduced in Casarini et al.

relieves the need to explore the entire functional space of dark energy state

hole binary GX 339-4 in its 2007 low/hard state is presented. The optical light
curves in the r', g' and u' filters show slow (~20 s) quasi-periodic
variability. Upon this is superposed fast flaring activity on times approaching
the best time resolution probed (~50 ms) and with maximum strengths of more
than twice the local mean. Power spectral analysis over ~0.004-10 Hz is
presented, and shows that although the average optical variability amplitude is
lower than that in X-rays, the peak variability power emerges at a higher
Fourier frequency in the optical. Energetically, we measure a large optical vs.
X-ray flux ratio, higher than that seen when the source was fully
jet-dominated. Such a large ratio cannot be easily explained with a disc alone.
The optical:X-ray cross-spectrum shows a markedly different behaviour above and
below ~0.2 Hz. The peak of the coherence function above this threshold is
associated with a short optical time lag, also seen as the dominant feature in
the time-domain cross-correlation at ~150 ms. The rms energy spectrum of these
fast variations is best described by distinct physical components over the
optical and X-ray regimes, and also suggests a maximal disc fraction of 20% at
~5000 A. If the constant time delay is due to propagation of fluctuations to
(or within) the jet, this is the clearest optical evidence to date of the
location of this component. The low-frequency QPO is seen in the optical but
not in X-rays. Evidence of reprocessing emerges at the lowest Fourier
frequencies, with optical lags at ~10 s and strong coherence in the blue u'
filter. Simultaneous optical spectroscopy also shows the Bowen fluorescence
blend, though its emission location is unclear. But canonical disc reprocessing
cannot dominate the optical power easily, nor explain the fast variability.

SNe Ia in passive hosts favor a dust law of R_V ~1, while SNe Ia in

the range of SN colors considered. We demonstrate that these effects can be

increasing importance of turbulent motions in lower mass galaxies leads to the
formation of thicker systems, a result supported by the latest hydrodynamical

$(\gamma,\delta)$ that control the IR dynamics. By studying the thermodynamics,
spectra and conductivities of several classes of charged dilatonic black hole
solutions that include the charge density back reaction fully, the landscape of
such theories in view of condensed matter applications is characterized.
Several regions of the $(\gamma,\delta)$ plane can be excluded as the extremal
solutions have unacceptable singularities. The classical solutions have
generically zero entropy at zero temperature, except when $\gamma=\delta$ where
the entropy at extremality is finite. The general scaling of DC resistivity
with temperature at low temperature, and AC conductivity at low frequency and
temperature across the whole $(\gamma,\delta)$ plane, is found. There is a
codimension-one region where the DC resistivity is linear in the temperature.
For massive carriers, it is shown that when the scalar operator is not the
dilaton, the DC resistivity scales as the heat capacity (and entropy) for
planar (3d) systems. Regions are identified where the theory at finite density
is a Mott-like insulator at T=0. We also find that at low enough temperatures

self-gravitating discs radiating near the Eddington limit. We show that the
ratio of the radiation pressure force to the gravitational force increases with
height above the disc surface to a maximum of twice the value of the ratio at
the disc surface. Thus, uniformly bright self-gravitating discs radiating at
the Eddington limit are fundamentally unstable to driving large-scale winds.
These results contrast with the spherically symmetric case, where
super-Eddington luminosities are required for wind formation. We apply this
theory to galactic winds from rapidly star-forming galaxies that approach the
Eddington limit for dust. For hydrodynamically coupled gas and dust, we find
that the asymptotic velocity of the wind is v_\infty ~ 1.5 v_rot and that
v_\infty SFR^{0.36}, where v_rot is the disc rotation velocity and SFR is the
star formation rate, both of which are in agreement with observations. However,
these results of the model neglect the gravitational potential of the
surrounding dark matter halo and an old passive stellar bulge or extended disc,
which act to decrease v_\infty. A more realistic treatment shows that the flow
can either be unbound, or bound, forming a ""fountain flow"" with a typical
turning timescale of t_turn ~ 0.1-1 Gyr. We provide quantitative criteria and
scaling relations for assessing whether or not a rapidly star-forming galaxy of
given properties can drive unbound flows via the mechanism described in this
paper. Importantly, we note that because t_turn is longer than the star
formation timescale in the rapidly star-forming galaxies and ULIRGs for which
our theory is most applicable, if rapidly star-forming galaxies are selected as
such, they may be observed to have strong outflows, even though their winds are
eventually bound on large scales.

starburst populations of XMMXCS J2215.9-1738 at z=1.46, one of the most distant
spectroscopically confirmed galaxy clusters known. The high resolution X-ray
imaging reveals that the cluster emission is contaminated by point sources that
were not resolved in XMM observations of the system, and have the effect of
hardening the spectrum, leading to the previously reported temperature for this
system being overestimated. From a joint spectroscopic analysis of the Chandra
and XMM data, the cluster is found to have temperature T=4.1_-0.9^+0.6 keV and
luminosity L_X=(2.92_-0.35^+0.24)x10^44 erg/s extrapolated to a radius of 2
Mpc. As a result of this revised analysis, the cluster is found to lie on the
sigma_v-T relation, but the cluster remains less luminous than would be
expected from self-similar evolution of the local L_X-T relation. Two of the
newly discovered X-ray AGN are cluster members, while a third object, which is
also a prominent 24 micron source, is found to have properties consistent with
it being a high redshift, highly obscured object in the background. We find a
total of eight >5 sigma 24 micron sources associated with cluster members (four
spectroscopically confirmed, and four selected using photometric redshifts),
and one additional 24 micron source with two possible optical/near-IR
counterparts that may be associated with the cluster. Examining the IRAC colors
of these sources, we find one object is likely to be an AGN. Assuming that the
other 24 micron sources are powered by star formation, their infrared
luminosities imply star formation rates ~100 M_sun/yr. We find that three of
these sources are located at projected distances of <250 kpc from the cluster
center, suggesting that a large amount of star formation may be taking place in
the cluster core, in contrast to clusters at low redshift.

with a publicly available radiative transfer code, to determine the emission
from three commonly used species - N2H+, CS, and HCN. A representative dense
core of 3 Msun that has been contracting for 1 Myr has line profiles that
qualitatively match the observed ones. In particular, optically thick lines
have about the right degree of blue-red asymmetry, the empirical hallmark of
contraction. The J=2-1 rotational transition of CS only attains the correct
type of profile if the species is centrally depleted, as has been suggested by
previous studies. These results support the idea that a slow, but accelerating,
contraction leads to protostellar collapse. In the future, the kind of analysis
presented here can be used to assign ages to individual starless cores.

special class of CV states, are the so-called Gaussian states. With them, it
has been possible to implement certain quantum tasks as quantum teleportation,
quantum cryptography and quantum computation with fantastic experimental
success. The importance of Gaussian states is two-fold; firstly, its structural
mathematical description makes them much more amenable than any other CV
system. Secondly, its production, manipulation and detection with current
optical technology can be done with a very high degree of accuracy and control.
Nevertheless, it is known that in spite of their exceptional role within the
space of all Continuous Variable states, in fact, Gaussian states are not
always the best candidates to perform quantum information tasks. Thus
non-Gaussian states emerge as potentially good candidates for communication and

nodes, the amount of data flow and the efficiency of data flow between nodes.
In traditional networks, due to physical limitations, topology remains static
for the course of the network operation. Ubiquitous data networks (UDNs),
alternatively, are more adaptive and can be configured for changes in their
topology. This flexibility in controlling their topology makes them very
appealing and an attractive medium for supporting ""anywhere, any place""
communication. However, it raises the problem of designing a dynamic topology.
The dynamic topology design problem is of particular interest to application
service providers who need to provide cost-effective data services on a
ubiquitous network. In this paper we describe algorithms that decide when and
how the topology should be reconfigured in response to a change in the data
communication requirements of the network. In particular, we describe and
compare a greedy algorithm, which is often used for topology reconfiguration,
with a non-greedy algorithm based on metrical task systems. Experiments show
the algorithm based on metrical task system has comparable performance to the
greedy algorithm at a much lower reconfiguration cost.

composition gradient energy to capture solute trapping, and is therefore suited
for studying phenomena where the width of the interface plays an important
role. Derivation of the inhomogeneous free energy functional from a Taylor
expansion of homogeneous free energy reveals how the interfacial properties of
each component and phase may be specified under a mass constraint. A diffusion
potential for components was defined away from the dilute solution limit, and a
multi-obstacle barrier function was used to constrain phase fractions. The
model was used to simulate solidification via nucleation, premelting at phase
boundaries and triple junctions, the intrinsic instability of small particles,
and solutal melting resulting from differing diffusivities in solid and liquid.
The shape of metastable free energy surfaces is found to play an important role
in microstructure evolution and may explain why some systems premelt at phase

to be precursors to Herbig AeBe stars and their associated clusters of low-mass

to compact HII regions, but they lack the massive ionizing central star(s). The
photodissociation regions that demarcate IM SFRs have typical diameters of ~1
pc and luminosities of ~10^4 solar luminosities, making them an order of
magnitude less luminous than (ultra)compact HII regions. IM SFRs coincide with
molecular clumps of mass ~10^3 solar masses which, in turn, lie within larger
molecular clouds spanning the lower end of the giant molecular cloud mass
range, 10^4-10^5 solar masses. The IR luminosity and associated molecular mass
of IM SFRs are correlated, consistent with the known luminosity-mass

given by $u(t) = \e^{-i t H} u_0$. Usually, this exponential matrix is
expensive to evaluate, so that time stepping methods to construct
approximations to $u$ from time $t_n$ to $t_{n+1}$ are considered in the second
phase of the procedure. Among them, schemes involving multiplications of the
matrix $H$ with vectors, such as Lanczos and Chebyshev methods, are
particularly efficient.
  In this work we consider a particular class of splitting methods which also
involves only products $Hu$. We carry out an error analysis of these
integrators and propose a strategy which allows us to construct different
splitting symplectic methods of different order (even of order zero) possessing
a large stability interval that can be adapted to different space regularity
conditions and different accuracy ranges of the spatial discretization. The
validity of the procedure and the performance of the resulting schemes are
illustrated on several numerical examples.

schools. We ignore the fish and focus on the dynamic interaction of multiple
wakes where each wake is modeled as a reverse von K'arm'an street. There exist
configurations where the infinite array of vortex streets is in relative
equilibrium, that is, the streets move together with the same translational
velocity. We examine the topology of the streamline patterns in a frame moving
with the same translational velocity as the streets which lends insight into
fluid transport through the mid-wake region. Fluid is advected along different
paths depending on the distance separating two adjacent streets. Generally,
when the distance between the streets is large enough, each street behaves as a
single von K'arm'an street and fluid moves globally between two adjacent
streets. When the streets get closer to each other, the number of streets that
enter into partnership in transporting fluid among themselves increases. This
observation motivates a bifurcation analysis which links the distance between
streets to the maximum number of streets transporting fluid among themselves.
We also show that for short times, the analysis of streamline topologies for
the infinite arrays of streets can be expected to set the pattern for the more
realistic case of a finite array of truncated streets, which is not in an
equilibrium state and its dynamic evolution eventually destroys the exact
topological patterns identified in the infinite array case. The problem of
fluid transport between adjacent streets may be relevant for understanding the
transport of oxygen and nutrients to inner fish in large schools as well as
understanding flow barriers to passive locomotion.

redshift is 2.12. We derived the star formation rates (SFRs) from
extinction-corrected Ha luminosities. The extinction correction is estimated
from the SED fitting of multi-band photometric data covering UV to NIR
wavelengths. The Balmer decrement of the stacked emission lines shows that the
amount of extinction for the ionized gas is larger than that for the stellar
continuum. From a comparison of the extinction corrected Ha luminosity and
other SFR indicators we found that the relation between the dust properties of
stellar continuum and ionized gas is different depending on the intrinsic SFR.
The comparison between the Ha SFR and stellar mass estimated from SED fitting
shows no correlation between them. Some galaxies with stellar mass smaller than
~10^10 Msun show SFRs higher than ~100 Msun/yr. The specific SFRs (SSFRs) of
these galaxies are remarkably high. The average stellar-population age of these
high-SSFR galaxies is younger than 100 Myr, which is consistent with the
implied high SSFR. The large SFR implies the possibility that the high SSFR
galaxies significantly contribute to the cosmic SFR density of the universe at
z~2. The total SFR density estimated from the Ha emission line galaxies is
0.089-0.136 Msun/yr/Mpc^3, which is consistent with the total SFR densities in

data of one Palomer-Green (PG) quasi-stellar object (QSO), PG 1700+518, with
strong optical \feii emission, we obtain the light curves of the continuum \lv,
\feii, the broad component of \hb, and the narrow component of \hb by the
spectral decomposition. Through the interpolation cross-correlation method, we
calculate the time lags for light curves of \feii, the total \hb, the broad
component of \hb, and the narrow component of \hb with respect to the continuum
light curve. We find that the \feii time lag in PG1700+518 is
$209^{+100}_{-147}$ days, and the \hb time lag cannot be determined. Assuming
that \feii and \hb emission regions follow the virial relation between the time
lag and the FWHM for the \hb and \feii emission lines, we can derive that the
\hb time lag is $148^{+72}_{-104}$ days. The \hb time lag calculated from the
empirical luminosity--size relation is 222 days, which is consistent with our
measured \feii time lag. Considering the optical \feii contribution, PG
1700+518 shares the same characteristic on the spectral slope variability as
other 15 PG QSOs in our previous work, i.e., harder spectrum during brighter
phase.

possible that the accretion rate measured by Chandra is underestimated, due to
additional persistent spectral components outside the sensitivity band, the

implausible. Furthermore, such underestimation is even more unlikely for RXTE

larger column depths, resulting in earlier ignition, or the fractional covering
of the accreted fuel on the neutron star surface.

in the vicinity of the BCS-BEC (Bose-Einstein condensation) topological phase
transition of p-wave resonant Fermi gases. By analytically and numerically
solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation for spinless p-wave superfluids with
plural vortices, it is demonstrated that the quasiparticle tunneling between
neighboring vortices gives rise to the quantum oscillation of the low-lying
spectra on the scale of the Fermi wavelength in addition to the exponential
splitting. This rapid oscillation, which appears in the weak coupling regime as
a consequence of quantum oscillations of quasiparticle wave functions,
disappears in the vicinity of the BCS-BEC topological phase transition. This is
understandable from that the wave function of the Majorana zero modes is
described by the modified Bessel function in the strong coupling regime and
thus it becomes spread over the vortex core region. Due to the exponential
divergence of the modified Bessel function, the concrete realization of the
Majorana zero modes near the topological phase transition requires the
neighboring vortices to be separated beyond the length scale defined by the
coherence length and the dimensionless coupling constant. All these behaviors
are also confirmed by carrying out the full numerical diagonalization of the
non-local Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation in a two dimensional geometry.
Furthermore, this argument is expanded into the case of three-vortex systems,
where a pair of core-bound and edge-bound Majorana states survive at zero
energy state regardless of the vortex separation.

point we find L_s=1.9(1) for our model and the boundary conditions discussed
here. Using this result for L_s we find a nice collapse of the finite size
scaling curves obtained for the thicknesses L_0=8.5, 16.5 and 32.5 for the full
range of temperatures that we consider. We compare our results for the finite
size scaling functions theta_++ and theta_+- of the thermodynamic Casimir force
with those obtained in a previous Monte Carlo study, by the de Gennes-Fisher
local-functional method, field theoretic methods and an experiment with a
binary mixture.

of multiple testing procedures are extended to fairly generally distributed
effect sizes under the alternative. An asymptotic framework is considered where
both the number of tests m and the sample size m go to infinity, while the
fraction p of true alternatives converges to zero. It is shown that under mild
restrictions on the loss function nontrivial asymptotic inference is possible
only if n increases to infinity at least at the rate of log m. Based on this
assumption precise conditions are given under which the Bonferroni correction
with nominal Family Wise Error Rate (FWER) level alpha and the Benjamini-
Hochberg procedure (BH) at FDR level alpha are asymptotically optimal. When n
is proportional to log m then alpha can remain fixed, whereas when n increases
to infinity at a quicker rate, then alpha has to converge to zero roughly like
n^(-1/2). Under these conditions the Bonferroni correction is ABOS in case of
extreme sparsity, while BH adapts well to the unknown level of sparsity.
  In the second part of this article these optimality results are carried over
to model selection in the context of multiple regression with orthogonal
regressors. Several modifications of Bayesian Information Criterion are
considered, controlling either FWER or FDR, and conditions are provided under
which these selection criteria are ABOS. Finally the performance of these
criteria is examined in a brief simulation study.

the impact of spots and plages on the radial velocity of the Sun. Our objective
is to compare this simulation with the observed radial velocity of the Sun for
the same period. We use Dopplergrams and magnetograms obtained by MDI/SOHO over
one solar cycle to reconstruct the solar integrated radial velocity in the Ni
line 6768 \AA. We also characterize the relation between the velocity and the
local magnetic field to interpret our results. We obtain a stronger redshift in
places where the local magnetic field is larger (and as a consequence for
larger magnetic structures): hence we find a higher attenuation of the
convective blueshift in plages than in the network. Our results are compatible
with an attenuation of this blueshift by about 50% when averaged over plages
and network. We obtain an integrated radial velocity with an amplitude over the
solar cycle of about 8 m/s, with small-scale variations similar to the results
of the simulation, once they are scaled to the Ni line. The observed solar
integrated radial velocity agrees with the result of the simulation made in our
previous work within 30%, which validates this simulation. The observed
amplitude confirms that the impact of the convective blueshift attenuation in
magnetic regions will be critical to detect Earth-mass planets in the habitable

nuclear flow is dominated by the rp-process (rapid proton-captures and beta+
decays), the 3 alpha-reaction, and the alpha-p-process (a suite of (alpha,p)
and (p,gamma) reactions). The main flow is expected to proceed away from the
valley of stability, eventually reaching the proton drip-line beyond A = 38.
Detailed analysis of the relevant reactions along the main path has only been
scarcely addressed, mainly in the context of parameterized one-zone models. In
this paper, we present a detailed study of the nucleosynthesis and nuclear
processes powering type I X-ray bursts. The reported 11 bursts have been
computed by means of a spherically symmetric (1D), Lagrangian, hydrodynamic
code, linked to a nuclear reaction network that contains 325 isotopes (from 1H
to 107Te), and 1392 nuclear processes. These evolutionary sequences, followed
from the onset of accretion up to the explosion and expansion stages, have been
performed for 2 different metallicities to explore the dependence between the
extension of the main nuclear flow and the initial metal content. We carefully
analyze the dominant reactions and the products of nucleosynthesis, together
with the the physical parameters that determine the light curve (including
recurrence times, ratios between persistent and burst luminosities, or the
extent of the envelope expansion). Results are in qualitative agreement with
the observed properties of some well-studied bursting sources. Leakage from the
predicted SbSnTe-cycle cannot be discarded in some of our models. Production of
12C (and implications for the mechanism that powers superbursts), light

recent advances in network coding have shown that there are advantages from
allowing intermediate nodes to process and combine, in addition to just
forward, packets. In this paper, we study the problem of loss tomography in
networks with network coding capabilities. We design a framework for estimating
link loss rates, which leverages network coding capabilities, and we show that
it improves several aspects of tomography including the identifiability of
links, the trade-off between estimation accuracy and bandwidth efficiency, and
the complexity of probe path selection. We discuss the cases of inferring link

high-temperature superconductivity in copper oxide materials, no consensus on
the pairing mechanism has been reached. Recent advances in high resolution
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopies have suggested that a sizeable
electron-phonon coupling exists as the principal cause for kinks in the
dispersion relations (energy versus wave vector) of the electronic states.
Here, we report on a systematic study about the influence of the
electron-phonon coupling parameter ""$\lambda$"" in the electronic quasiparticle
dispersions along the nodal direction for $La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}$,
$Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8+x}$ and $YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x}$. Information about the
dressing of the charge carriers, i.e., on the enhancement of the effective mass
and the strength of the coupling mode, is obtained as a function of the doping
concentration, temperature, momentum and energy from the kink dispersion in the
(0-0)-$(\pi,\pi)$ direction of momentum-space avoiding the complications of the
\textit{d-}wave superconducting gap. Our analysis shows a remarkable agreement
between theory and experiment for different samples and at different doping
levels. This includes our recently introduced theoretical model to adjust the
experimental data of the fermionic band dispersion, emphasising the necessary
distinction between the general electron mass-enhancement parameter
$\lambda^{*}$ and the conventional electron-phonon coupling parameter
$\lambda$.

different spin-spin coupling is considered. We show under which conditions the
environment drives the reduced density matrix of the system to a fully

approach those expected for the system in the microcanonical or canonical

demonstration does not rely on time-averaging of observables nor does it assume
that the coupling between system and bath is weak. Our findings show that the

ensemble are states that may result from pure quantum dynamics, suggesting that
quantum mechanics may be regarded as the foundation of quantum statistical
mechanics. Furthermore, our numerical results show that a fully decoherent

hence the retardation effects are important part of the physics. The dynamic
Lindhard response function of the fermionic density to changes in the bosonic

consequence the inter-species interaction between particles becomes repulsive
in contrast to the static limit (instantaneous and always attractive).

About half of the
known sdBs are in close binary systems for which common envelope ejection is
the most likely formation channel. Little is known about this dynamic phase of
binary evolution. Due to the tidal influence of the companion in close binary
systems, the rotation of the primary becomes synchronised to its orbital
motion. In this case it is possible to constrain the mass of the companion, if
the primary mass, its projected rotational velocity as well as its surface
gravity are known. For the first time we measured the projected rotational
velocities of a large sdB binary sample from high resolution spectra. We
analysed a sample of 51 sdB stars in close binaries, 40 of which have known
orbital parameters comprising half of all such systems known today.
Synchronisation in sdB binaries is discussed both from the theoretical and the
observational point of view. The masses and the nature of the unseen companions
could be constrained in 31 cases. The companions to seven sdBs could be clearly
identified as late M stars. One binary may have a brown dwarf companion. The
unseen companions of nine sdBs are white dwarfs with typical masses. The mass
of one white dwarf companion is very low. In eight cases the companion mass
exceeds 0.9 solar masses, four of which even exceed the Chandrasekhar limit
indicating that they may be neutron stars. Even stellar mass black holes are
possible for the most massive companions. The distribution of the inclinations
of the systems with low mass companions appears to be consistent with
expectations, whereas a lack of high inclinations becomes obvious for the
massive systems. We show that the formation of such systems can be explained

scales which might be due either to AGN or starburst activity. We therefore aim
at investigating its central region for a putative starburst in the past and
its connection to the AGN and the outflows. Observations were performed with
the adaptive optics near infrared integral field spectrograph SINFONI on the
VLT, complemented by longslit observations with ISAAC on the VLT, as well as N-
and Q-band data from the Spitzer archive. The spatial and spectral resolutions
of the SINFONI data are 50 pc and 83 km/s, respectively. The field of view of
3"" x 3"" corresponds to 450 pc x 450 pc. Br_gamma equivalent width and line
fluxes from PAHs were compared to stellar population models to constrain the
age of the putative recent star formation. A simple geometric model of two
mutually inclined disks and an additional cone to describe an outflow was
developed to explain the observed complex velocity field in H_2 1-0S(1). The
morphologies of the Br_gamma and the stellar continuum are different suggesting
that at least part of the Br_gamma emission comes from the AGN. This is
confirmed by PAH emission lines at 6.2 micron and 11.2 micron and the strength
of the silicon absorption feature at 9.7 micron, which point to dominant AGN
activity with a relatively minor starburst contribution. We find a starburst
age of 40 Myr - 50 Myr from Br_gamma line diagnostics and the radio continuum;
ongoing star formation can be excluded. Both the energetics and the timescales
indicate that the outflows are driven by the AGN rather than the starburst. The
complex velocity field observed in H_2 1-0S(1) in the central 450 pc can be
explained by the superposition of the galaxy rotation and an outflow.

corresponds to the convolution with a kernel of the form \[ K_{\phi,t}(x) =

difficulty here, is that the kernel $K_{\phi,t}$ is not positive and that its

the scheme is consistent with the anisotropic mean curvature flow.

spatially allocates resources for the parallel evaluation of dataflow. Formal
models called the a-Ram family are introduced, designed to support interstring
programming languages (interlanguages). Distinct from dataflow, graph
rewriting, and FPGA models, a-Ram instructions are bit level and execute in
situ. They support sequential and parallel languages without the space/time
overheads associated with the Turing Machine and lambda-calculus, enabling
massive programs to be simulated. The devices of one a-Ram model, called the
Synchronic A-Ram, are fully connected and simpler than FPGA LUT's. A compiler
for an interlanguage called Space, has been developed for the Synchronic A-Ram.
Space is MIMD. strictly typed, and deterministic. Barring memory allocation and
compilation, modules are referentially transparent. At a high level of
abstraction, modules exhibit a state transition system, aiding verification.
Data structures and parallel iteration are straightforward to implement, and
allocations of sub-processes and data transfers to resources are implicit.
Space points towards highly connected architectures called Synchronic Engines,

cosmology and particle physics. Several interesting extensions of the standard
model dealing with solution of this problem motivate the concept of hidden
sectors consisting of SU(3)xSU(2)_LxU(1)_Y singlet fields. Among these models,
the mirror matter model is certainly one of the most interesting. The model
explains the origin of parity violation in weak interactions, it could also
explain the baryon asymmetry of the Universe and provide a natural ground for
the explanation of dark matter. The mirror matter could have a portal to our
world through photon-mirror photon mixing (epsilon). This mixing would lead to
orthopositronium (o-Ps) to mirror orthopositronium oscillations, the
experimental signature of which is the apparently invisible decay of o-Ps. In
this paper, we describe an experiment to search for the decay o-Ps -> invisible
in vacuum by using a pulsed slow positron beam and a massive 4pi BGO crystal
calorimeter. The developed high efficiency positron tagging system, the low
calorimeter energy threshold and high hermiticity allow the expected
sensitivity in mixing strength to be epsilon about 10^-9, which is more than
one order of magnitude below the current Big Bang Nucleosynthesis limit and in
a region of parameter space of great theoretical and phenomenological interest.
The vacuum experiment with such sensitivity is particularly timely in light of
the recent DAMA/LIBRA observations of the annual modulation signal consistent
with a mirror type dark matter interpretation.

the observation of a clear decay of the hard X-ray emission from the molecular
cloud Sgr B2 during the past 7 years thanks to more than 20 Ms of INTEGRAL
exposure. The measured decay time is compatible with the light crossing time of
the molecular cloud core . Such a short timescale rules out inverse
bremsstrahlung by cosmic-ray ions as the origin of the X ray emission. We also
obtained 2-100 keV broadband X-ray spectra by combining INTEGRAL and XMM-Newton
data and compared them with detailed models of X-ray emission due to
irradiation of molecular gas by (i) low-energy cosmic-ray electrons and (ii)
hard X-rays. Both models can reproduce the data equally well, but the time
variability constraints and the huge cosmic ray electron luminosity required to
explain the observed hard X-ray emission strongly favor the scenario in which
the diffuse emission of Sgr B2 is scattered and reprocessed radiation emitted
in the past by Sgr A*. Using recent parallax measurements that place Sgr B2 in

important research area in the genomics and medical disciplines. Accurate
predicators are necessary for constructing the GRN model and to enable targeted
biological experiments that attempt to confirm or control the regulation
process. In this paper, we implement a SAT-based algorithm to determine the
gene predictor set from steady state gene expression data (attractor states).
Using the attractor states as input, the states are ordered into attractor
cycles. For each attractor cycle ordering, all possible predictors are
enumerated and a CNF expression is formulated which encodes these predictors
and their biological constraints. Each CNF is explored using a SAT solver to
find candidate predictor sets. Statistical analysis of the results selects the
most likely predictor set of the GRN corresponding to the attractor data. We
demonstrate our algorithm on attractor state data from a melanoma study, and
present our predictor set results.

interests, and where there is no access to an agent's internal state, are often
classified as `open'. The member agents of such systems may inadvertently fail
to, or even deliberately choose not to, conform to the system specification.
Consequently, it is necessary to specify the normative relations that may exist
between the agents, such as permission, obligation, and institutional power.
The specification of open agent systems of this sort is largely seen as a
design-time activity. Moreover, there is no support for run-time specification
modification. Due to environmental, social, or other conditions, however, it is
often required to revise the specification during the system execution. To
address this requirement, we present an infrastructure for `dynamic'
specifications, that is, specifications that may be modified at run-time by the
agents. The infrastructure consists of well-defined procedures for proposing a
modification of the `rules of the game', as well as decision-making over and
enactment of proposed modifications. We evaluate proposals for rule
modification by modelling a dynamic specification as a metric space, and by
considering the effects of accepting a proposal on system utility. Furthermore,
we constrain the enactment of proposals that do not meet the evaluation
criteria. We employ the action language C+ to formalise dynamic specifications,
and the `Causal Calculator' implementation of C+ to execute the specifications.
We illustrate our infrastructure by presenting a dynamic specification of a
resource-sharing protocol.

geometry with simplified profiles of kinematic alpha effect and shear. We take
magnetic helicity evolution into account by solving a dynamical equation for
the magnetic alpha effect. This gives a consistent description of the quenching
mechanism in mean-field dynamo models. The main goal of this work is to explore
the effects of this quenching mechanism in solar-like geometry, and in
particular to investigate the role of magnetic helicity fluxes, specifically
diffusive and Vishniac-Cho (VC) fluxes, at large magnetic Reynolds numbers
(Rm). For models with negative radial shear or positive latitudinal shear, the
magnetic alpha effect has predominantly negative (positive) sign in the
northern (southern) hemisphere. In the absence of fluxes, we find that the
magnetic energy follows an Rm^-1 dependence, as found in previous works. This
catastrophic quenching is alleviated in models with diffusive magnetic helicity
fluxes resulting in magnetic fields comparable to the equipartition value even
for Rm=10^7. On the other hand, models with a shear-driven Vishniac-Cho flux
show an increase of the amplitude of the magnetic field with respect to models
without fluxes, but only for Rm<10^4. This is mainly a consequence of assuming
a vacuum outside the Sun which cannot support a significant VC flux across the
boundary. However, in contrast with the diffusive flux, the VC flux modifies
the distribution of the magnetic field. In addition, if an ill-determined
scaling factor in the expression for the VC flux is large enough, subcritical
dynamo action is possible that is driven by the action of shear and the
divergence of current helicity flux.

binary system is derived. The measured mass function indicates a main sequence
companion with a mass between 0.15 and 0.44 Msun. The XMM-Newton spectrum of
the source can be modelled by at least three components, multicoloured disc
emission, thermal emission from the NS surface and thermal Comptonization
emission. Spectral fit of the XMM-Newton data and of the RXTE data, taken in a
simultaneous temporal window, constrain the Comptonization parameters: the
electron temperature, kT_e=51(+6,-4) keV, is rather high, while the optical
depth (tau=1.34(+0.03,-0.06)) is moderate. The energy dependence of the pulsed
fraction supports the interpretation of the cooler thermal component as coming
from the accretion disc, and indicates that the Comptonizing plasma surrounds
the hot spots on the NS surface, which provide the seed photons. Signatures of
reflection, such as a broadened iron K-alpha emission line and a Compton hump
at 30 keV ca., are also detected. We derive from the smearing of the reflection
component an inner disc radius of ~> 40 km for a 1.4 Msun neutron star, and an
inclination between 38{\deg} and 68{\deg}. XMM-Newton also observed two type-I
X-ray bursts, probably ignited in a nearly pure helium environment. No
photospheric radius expansion is observed, thus leading to an upper limit on
the distance to the source of 10 kpc. A lower limit of 6.5 kpc can be also set
if it is assumed that emission during the decaying part of the burst involves
the whole neutron star surface. Pulsations observed during the burst decay are
compatible with being phase locked, and have a similar amplitude, than
pre-burst pulsations.

been successfully correlated to animal behavior. Population bursting, hereby
regarded as a period of high firing rate followed by a period of quiescence, is
typically observed in groups of neurons during behavior. Biophysical
membrane-potential models of single cell bursting involve at least three
equations. Extending such models to study the collective behavior of neural
populations involves thousands of equations and can be very expensive
computationally. For this reason, low dimensional population models that
capture biophysical aspects of networks are needed.
  \noindent The present paper uses a firing-rate model to study mechanisms that
trigger and stop transitions between tonic and phasic population firing. These
mechanisms are captured through a two-dimensional system, which can potentially
be extended to include interactions between different areas of the nervous
system with a small number of equations. The typical behavior of midbrain
dopaminergic neurons in the rodent is used as an example to illustrate and
interpret our results.
  \noindent The model presented here can be used as a building block to study
interactions between networks of neurons. This theoretical approach may help
contextualize and understand the factors involved in regulating burst firing in
populations and how it may modulate distinct aspects of behavior.

by formation of a surface molecular peroxide ion. In contrast, the neutral

communicating a Gaussian source over a Gaussian channel under the mean squared

inferior to the all-digital, separation-based source-channel coding solution,
which requires exact knowledge of the channel at the encoder. The loss comes
from the fact that except for very special cases, e.g. white source and channel
of matching bandwidth (BW), it is impossible to achieve perfect matching of
source to channel and channel to source by linear means. We show that by
combining prediction and modulo-lattice operations, it is possible to match any
colored Gaussian source to any colored Gaussian noise channel (of possibly
different BW), hence achieve Shannon's optimum attainable performance $R(D)=C$.
Furthermore, when the source and channel BWs are equal (but otherwise their
spectra are arbitrary), this scheme is asymptotically robust in the sense that
for high signal-to-noise ratio a single encoder (independent of the noise
variance) achieves the optimum performance. The derivation is based upon a

color, or other potential systematic effects. Last epoch measurements and
reductions are underway for other four Quasar fields of this galaxy, which,
when combined, should yield proper motions with a weighted mean error of
$\sim50\,\mu$as y$^{-1}$, allowing us to place important constraints on the
orbit of Fornax.

excitations in the Fe-based chalcogenide system
Fe$_{1+\delta}$Se$_{x}$Te$_{1-x}$ with different Fe and Se compositions.
Short-range static magnetic order with the ""bicollinear"" spin configuration is
found in all non-superconducting samples, with strong low-energy magnetic
excitations near the $(0.5,0)$ in-plane wave-vector (using the two-Fe unit
cell) for Se doping up to 45%. When the static order disappears and bulk
superconductivity emerges, the spectral weight of the magnetic excitations
shifts to the region of reciprocal space near the in-plane wave-vector
$(0.5,0.5)$, corresponding to the ""collinear"" spin configuration. Our results
suggest that spin fluctuations associated with the collinear magnetic structure
appear to be universal in all Fe-based superconductors, and there is a strong
correlation between superconductivity and the character of the magnetic
order/fluctuations in

order parameter in the valley space substantially affects conditions of the
pairing. Electron-hole pairing in graphene bilayer in the strong coupling
regime is also considered. Taking into account retardation of the screened
Coulomb pairing potential shows a significant competition between the
electron-hole direct attraction and their repulsion due to virtual plasmons and
single-particle excitations.

orthospectrum identities of Basmajian and Bridgeman. Our method also
considerably simplifies the determination of the summands in these identities.
For example, for every odd integer n, there is a rational function q_n of
degree 2(n-2) so that if M is a compact hyperbolic manifold of dimension n with
totally geodesic boundary S, there is an identity \chi(S) = \sum_i q_n(e^{l_i})
where the sum is taken over the orthospectrum of M. When n=3, this has the
explicit form \sum_i 1/(e^{2l_i}-1) = -\chi(S)/4.

deformation of the matrix (as calculated using atomistic simulations) around
the columns, as well as the average inter-column distance can account for the
shape of the diffusion around Bragg peaks.
