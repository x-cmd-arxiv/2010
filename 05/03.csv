transitions in spin systems subject to a stochastic spin-flip dynamics. Using
the general theory for large deviations of functionals of Markov processes
outlined in Feng and Kurtz [11], we show that the trajectory under the
spin-flip dynamics of the empirical measure of the spins in a large block in
Z^d satisfies a large deviation principle in the limit as the block size tends
to infinity. The associated rate function can be computed as the action
functional of a Lagrangian that is the Legendre transform of a certain
non-linear generator, playing a role analogous to the moment-generating
function in the Gartner-Ellis theorem of large deviation theory when this is
applied to finite-dimensional Markov processes. This rate function is used to
define the notion of ""bad empirical measures"", which are the discontinuity
points of the optimal trajectories (i.e., the trajectories minimizing the rate
function) given the empirical measure at the end of the trajectory. The
dynamical Gibbs-non-Gibbs transitions are linked to the occurrence of bad
empirical measures: for short times no bad empirical measures occur, while for
intermediate and large times bad empirical mea- sures are possible. A future
research program is proposed to classify the various possible scenarios behind
this crossover, which we refer to as a ""nature-versus-nurture"" transition.

the rest might be due to the contamination by the nearby H II emission regions

In addition, we search the $Chandra$ Observatory archival data for the X-ray
counterparts to the optically identified candidates. We find positional
coincidence with only three SNR candidates, SNR1, SNR2, and SNR8. The spectrum
of SNR2 yields a shock temperature of 10.8 keV with an ionization timescale of

that elastic seismic energy is refocused in space and time to the shot

invertibility at infinity, and invertibility or injectivity of the set of limit
operators, with some emphasis on the case when the operator $A$ is a locally
compact perturbation of the identity. Especially, we obtain stronger results

network called the discrete superposition network. We show that this discrete
superposition network provides a near-optimal digital interface for operating a
class consisting of many Gaussian networks in the sense that any code for the
discrete superposition network can be naturally lifted to a corresponding code
for the Gaussian network, while achieving a rate that is no more than a
constant number of bits lesser than the rate it achieves for the discrete
superposition network. This constant depends only on the number of nodes in the
network and not on the channel gains or SNR. Moreover the capacities of the two
networks are within a constant of each other, again independent of channel
gains and SNR. We show that the class of Gaussian networks for which this
interface property holds includes relay networks with a single
source-destination pair, interference networks, multicast networks, and the
counterparts of these networks with multiple transmit and receive antennas.
  The code for the Gaussian relay network can be obtained from any code for the
discrete superposition network simply by pruning it. This lifting scheme
establishes that the superposition model can indeed potentially serve as a
strong surrogate for designing codes for Gaussian relay networks.
  We present similar results for the K x K Gaussian interference network, MIMO
Gaussian interference networks, MIMO Gaussian relay networks, and multicast
networks, with the constant gap depending additionally on the number of
antennas in case of MIMO networks.

In particular, our results show that any 2+1 initial data set, which obeys the

satisfies a mild asymptotic condition, must have trivial topology. Moreover,
any data set obeying these conditions cannot contain a MOTS. The asymptotic
condition involves a cutoff at a finite boundary at which a null mean convexity
condition is assumed to hold; this null mean convexity condition is satisfied
by all the standard asymptotic boundary conditions. The results presented here
strengthen various aspects of previous related results in the literature. These
results not only have implications for classical 2+1 gravity but also apply to

report on the first detection of a negative bias in DIMM data. This is found to
occur, as predicted, when the DIMM is affected by certain optical aberrations

head-of-line packets is derived from the Markov chain of underlying scheduling
algorithm. The main results include the complete analysis of the throughput and

throughput and bounded mean delay of the Geometric Retransmission and
Exponential Backoff schemes. We show that the throughput stable region of
Geometric Retransmission will vanish as the number of nodes n \rightarrow
\infty; thus, it is inherently unstable for large n. In contrast to Geometric
Retransmission, the throughput stable region of Exponential Backoff can be
obtained for an infinite population. We found that the bounded mean delay
region of Geometric Retransmission remains the same as its throughput stable
region. Besides, the variance of service time of Exponential Backoff can be
unbounded due to the capture effect; thus, its bounded delay region is only a
sub-set of its throughput stable region. Analytical results presented in this

an n-cycle can be demonstrated in various ways that do not necessarily provide
a geometry-independent description. For example, the position probability
distribution becomes increasingly Gaussian, with a concomitant fall in the
standard deviation, in the former case, but not in the latter. As another
example, each step of the quantum walk on a line may be subjected to an
arbitrary phase gate, without affecting the position probability distribution,
no matter whether the walk is noiseless or noisy. This symmetry, which is
absent in the case of noiseless cyclic walk, but is restored in the presence of
sufficient noise, serves as an indicator of classicalization, but only in the
cyclic case. Here we show that the degree of quantum correlations between the
coin and position degrees of freedom, quantified by a measure based on the
disturbance induced by local measurements (Luo, Phys. Rev. A 77, 022301
(2008)), provides a suitable measure of classicalization across both type of
walks. Applying this measure to compare the two walks, we find that cyclic
quantum walks tend to classicalize faster than quantum walks on a line because
of more efficient phase randomization due to the self-interference of the two
counter-rotating waves. We model noise as acting on the coin, and given by the
squeezed generalized amplitude damping (SGAD) channel, which generalizes the
generalized amplitude damping channel.

meV at 1.70 K) and temperature dependence as extracted from the Andreev
conductance spectra reveal strong-coupling superconductivity and is consistent
with $s$-wave order parameter symmetry. No clear evidence for multiple order
parameters or interference from multiple bands is observed. A conductance
enhancement persists above $T_\textrm{c}$ to $\sim 18-20$ K and possible
origins, including novel quasiparticle scattering due to strong
antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations, are discussed.

instead of a predefined one, can improve the sparsity in jointly representing a
class of signals. This has motivated the derivation of learning methods for
designing a dictionary which leads to the sparsest representation for a given
set of signals. In some applications, the signals of interest can have further
structure, so that they can be well approximated by a union of a small number
of subspaces (e.g., face recognition and motion segmentation). This implies the
existence of a dictionary which enables block-sparse representations of the
input signals once its atoms are properly sorted into blocks. In this paper, we
propose an algorithm for learning a block-sparsifying dictionary of a given set
of signals. We do not require prior knowledge on the association of signals
into groups (subspaces). Instead, we develop a method that automatically
detects the underlying block structure. This is achieved by iteratively
alternating between updating the block structure of the dictionary and updating
the dictionary atoms to better fit the data. Our experiments show that for
block-sparse data the proposed algorithm significantly improves the dictionary
recovery ability and lowers the representation error compared to dictionary
learning methods that do not employ block structure.

energies, namely the adaptive biasing force (ABF) method. The free energy is
the effective potential associated to a so-called reaction coordinate (RC).
Computing free energy differences remains an important challenge in molecular
dynamics due to the presence of meta-stable regions in the potential energy
surface. The ABF method uses an on-the-fly estimate of the free energy to bias
dynamics and overcome metastability. Using entropy arguments and logarithmic
Sobolev inequalities, previous results have shown that the rate of convergence
of the ABF method is limited by the metastable features of the canonical
measures conditioned to being at fixed values of the RC. In this paper, we
present an improvement on the existing results, in the presence of such
metastabilities, which is a generic case encountered in practice. More
precisely, we study the so-called bi-channel case, where two channels along the
RC direction exist between an initial and final state, the channels being
separated from each other by a region of very low probability. With hypotheses
made on `channel-dependent' conditional measures, we show on a bi-channel model
that we introduce, that the convergence of the ABF method is in fact not
limited by metastabilities in directions orthogonal to the RC under two crucial
assumptions: (i) exchange between the two channels is possible for some values
of the RC and (ii) the free energy is a good bias in each channel.

the relatively low melting point of paraffin, a limited temperature range of
43-80 deg C was explored, with the lower end corresponding to a dimer density
of less than 10^7 cm^(-3). With one-minute integration time, a sensitivity to

of the French economist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (1809-1865) in relation to the
causes and effects of Stock market speculation. It is based upon the works of
this author but particularly on his ""Manuel du sp\'eculateur \`a la Bourse""
(Stock Market Speculator Manual) edited in 1857 in Paris. Compared to the
markets of today, however, the stock market described by Proudhon appears
embryonic. Nevertheless it represents the location for transactions in
financial assets, commodities, precious metals and even some transactions
involving options. This contribution is organised in the following manner - the
first section is devoted to the development of Proudhon's thought in relation
to speculation. It is divided into two parts. The first part is dedicated to
Pierre-Joseph Proudhon's definitions of stock market speculation or gambling
with shares that for him served no purpose either from a human or economic
perspective and was therefore condemnable and to be contrasted with
entrepreneurial speculation that, even though it is a highly-risky activity,
involves the spirit of enterprise and provides the lifeblood of economic
growth. The second part allows us to present Pierre-Joseph Proudhon's
propositions in relation to restricting the speculation that he considers
obnoxious. The second section has two objectives: one part places in
perspective the views of Proudhon and the characteristics of stock market
activity under the Second Empire whilst the other part examines current-day
aspects of the characteristics evoked by Proudhon. We are interested especially
in the question of the regulation and that of the relevance today of certain
accounting practices.

shorter time scale corresponds to a direct relaxation and the longer can be
explained by the existence of intermediate, metastable states similar to those

elevated plus-maze and partition tests, respectively. In the social
interactions test, sociable behavior toward unfamiliar partner and exploratory
activity were dramatically decreased in defeated male mice. Avoidance of
approaching partner was significantly increased. Demonstration of self-grooming
behavior was increased in defeated males. Chronic diazepam treatment (0.5
mg/kg, i.p., 2 weeks) led to significant decrease of anxiety level estimated in
the elevated plus maze test and to improvement of communication in the
partition test. In the social interaction test diazepam completely restored the
level of sociability and exploratory activity and reduced avoidance behavior of
approaching partner. Diazepam did not affect self-grooming demonstration. It is
concluded that main factor which provokes decrease in communication in defeated
male mice is the high level of anxiety. Similarity between changes in social
behavior in defeated mice and symptoms of autism in humans is discussed. It is
supposed that this behavioral approach may be useful for studying the molecular
mechanisms of autistic spectrum disorders, developing under chronic negative

the fully nonlinear differential equation for the evolution of the density
contrast within homogeneous spherical overdensities derived from Newtonian
hydrodynamics. While mathematically equivalent to the more common approach
based on the differential equation for the radius of the perturbation, this
approach has substantial conceptual as well as numerical advantages. Among the
most important are that no singularities at early times appear, which avoids
numerical problems in particular in applications to cosmologies with dynamical
and early dark energy, and that the assumption of time-reversal symmetry can
easily be dropped where it is not strictly satisfied. We use this approach to
derive the two parameters characterising the spherical-collapse model, i.e.~the
linear density threshold for collapse $\delta_\mathrm{c}$ and the virial
overdensity $\Delta_\mathrm{V}$, for a broad variety of dark-energy models and
to reconsider these parameters in cosmologies with early dark energy. We find
that, independently of the model under investigation, $\delta_\mathrm{c}$ and
$\Delta_\mathrm{V}$ are always very close to the values obtained for the
standard $\Lambda$CDM model, arguing that the abundance of and the mean density
within non-linear structures are quite insensitive to the differences between
dark-energy cosmologies. Regarding early dark energy, we thus arrive at a
different conclusion than some earlier papers, including one from our group,

graph (of some maximum length m). Since the number of paths can be huge, we
propose novel algorithms whose time complexity depends only on the size of the
graph, and on the relative frequency epsilon of the most frequent traces. In
addition, we apply techniques from streaming algorithms to achieve space usage
that depends only on epsilon, and not on the number of distinct traces. The
abstract problem considered models a variety of tasks concerning finding
frequent patterns in event sequences. Our motivation comes from working with a
data set of 2 million RFID readings from baggage trolleys at Copenhagen
Airport. The question of finding frequent passenger movement patterns is mapped
to the above problem. We report on experimental findings for this data set.

inflationary theories can predict a certain amount of primordial

realistic maps of different lensing quantities starting from light-cones
extracted from large dark-matter only N-body simulations with initial
conditions corresponding to different levels of primordial local
non-Gaussianity strength $f_{\rm NL}$. Considering various statistical
quantities (PDF, power spectrum, shear in aperture, skewness and bispectrum) we
find that the effect produced by the presence of primordial non-Gaussianity is
relatively small, being of the order of few per cent for values of $|f_{\rm
NL}|$ compatible with the present CMB constraints and reaching at most 10-15
per cent for the most extreme cases with $|f_{\rm NL}|=1000$. We also discuss
the degeneracy of this effect with the uncertainties due to the power spectrum
normalization $\sigma_8$ and matter density parameter $\Omega_{\rm m}$, finding
that an error in the determination of $\sigma_8$ ($\Omega_{\rm m}$) of about 3
(10) per cent gives differences comparable with non-Gaussian models having
$f_{\rm NL}=\pm 1000$. These results suggest that the possible presence of an
amount of primordial non-Gaussianity corresponding to $|f_{\rm NL}|=100$ is not
hampering a robust determination of the main cosmological parameters in present

the Gaussian hypothesis is possible only breaking the degeneracy with other
cosmological parameters and using data from deep surveys covering a large

uncertainty which affect the \Delta Y/\Delta Z derived from the analysis of the
low-main sequence (MS) stars in the solar neighborhood. The possibility to
infer the value of \Delta Y/\Delta Z from the study of low-MS stars relies on
the dependence of the stellar luminosity and effective temperature on the
initial Y and Z. The \Delta Y/\Delta Z ratio is obtained by comparing the
magnitude difference between the observed stars and a reference theoretical
zero age main sequence (ZAMS) with the related theoretical magnitude
differences computed from a new set of stellar models with up-to-date input
physics and a fine grid of chemical compositions. A Monte Carlo approach has
been used to evaluate the impact on the result of different sources of
uncertainty, i.e. observational errors, evolutionary effects, systematic
uncertainties of the models. As a check of the procedure, the method has been
applied to a different data set, namely the low-MS of the Hyades. Once a set of
ZAMS and atmosphere models have been chosen, we found that the inferred value
of \Delta Y/\Delta Z is sensitive to the age of the stellar sample, even if we
restricted the data set to low luminosity stars. The lack of an accurate age
estimate of low mass field stars leads to an underestimate of the inferred
\Delta Y/\Delta Z of ~2 units. On the contrary the method firmly recovers the
\Delta Y/\Delta Z value for not evolved samples of stars such as the Hyades
low-MS. Adopting a solar calibrated mixing-length parameter and the PHOENIX
GAIA v2.6.1 atmospheric models, we found \Delta Y/\Delta Z = 5.3 +/- 1.4 once
the age correction has been applied. The Hyades sample provided a perfectly
consistent value.

develop a method to quantify the variability of a source. We describe here our
techniques and compile a catalog of the sources that fit our criteria of

detected sources are constant using a $\chi^2$ all-sky map in three energy
bands (20-40, 40-100, 100-200 keV). We calculate an intrinsic variance of the

modified version, having a parabolic current density profile, is employed here.
We find that the equilibrium is reconstructed with very high accuracy in a
representative range of parameter space, using only the vector field in the

the flux rope and the surrounding arcade-""hyperbolic flux tube"" and ""bald patch

energy and helicity of the configuration. This demonstrates that force-free
fields containing these basic structural elements of solar active regions can
be obtained by extrapolation. The influence of the chosen initial condition on
the accuracy of reconstruction is also addressed, confirming that the initial
field that best matches the external potential field of the model quite
naturally leads to the best reconstruction. Extrapolating the magnetogram of a
Titov-D\'emoulin equilibrium in the unstable range of parameter space yields a
sequence of two opposing evolutionary phases which clearly indicate the

rising free energy is followed by destruction of the rope, losing most of the

substantial bias in the topology of galaxy clustering with respect to the
predicted topology of the matter distribution, which varies with luminosity,
morphology, color, and the smoothing scale of the density field. The
distribution of relatively brighter galaxies shows a greater prevalence of
isolated clusters and more percolated voids. Even though early (late)-type
galaxies show topology similar to that of red (blue) galaxies, the morphology
dependence of topology is not identical to the color dependence. In particular,
the void abundance parameter $A_V$ depends on morphology more strongly than on

solution of comoving frame (CMF) radiative transfer equation. The wind models
are calculated for the first stars, O stars, and the central stars of planetary
nebulae. We show that without line overlaps and with solely thermal line
broadening the pure Sobolev approximation provides a reliable estimate of the
radiative force even close to the wind sonic point. Consequently, models with
the Sobolev line force provide good approximations to solutions obtained with
non-Sobolev transfer. Taking line overlaps into account, the radiative force
becomes slightly lower, leading to a decrease in the wind mass-loss rate by
roughly 40%. Below the sonic point, the CMF line force is significantly lower
than the Sobolev one. In the case of pure thermal broadening, this does not
influence the mass-loss rate, as the wind mass-loss rate is set in the
supersonic part of the wind. However, when additional line broadening is
present (e.g., the turbulent one) the region of low CMF line force may extend
outwards to the regions where the mass-loss rate is set. This results in a
decrease in the wind mass-loss rate. This effect can at least partly explain
the low wind mass-loss rates derived from some observational analyses of
luminous O stars.

for a large number of stars. Among intermediate-mass and massive stars, fast
rotators are common objects. Taking the rotation effects into account is needed
to correctly understand, identify, and interpret the observed oscillation
frequencies of these stars. A classical approach is to consider the rotation as
a perturbation. In this paper, we focus on gravity modes, such as those
occurring in gamma Doradus, slowly pulsating B (SPB), or Be stars. We aim to
define the suitability of perturbative methods. With the two-dimensional
oscillation program (TOP), we performed complete computations of gravity modes
-including the Coriolis force, the centrifugal distortion, and compressible
effects- in 2-D distorted polytropic models of stars. We started with the modes
l=1, n=1-14, and l=2-3, n=1-5,16-20 of a nonrotating star, and followed these
modes by increasing the rotation rate up to 70% of the break-up rotation rate.
We then derived perturbative coefficients and determined the domains of
validity of the perturbative methods. Second-order perturbative methods are
suited to computing low-order, low-degree mode frequencies up to rotation
speeds ~100 km/s for typical gamma Dor stars or ~150 km/s for B stars. The
domains of validity can be extended by a few tens of km/s thanks to the
third-order terms. For higher order modes, the domains of validity are
noticeably reduced. Moreover, perturbative methods are inefficient for modes
with frequencies lower than the Coriolis frequency 2Omega. We interpret this
failure as a consequence of a modification in the shape of the resonant cavity
that is not taken into account in the perturbative approach.

with self-consistent sources, then to transform it into a $t$-type
bi-Hamiltonian system. By using this generalized Kupershmidt deformation some

K{\alpha} emission in AGNs and the dependence of the spectral parameters on the
X-ray luminosity and redshift. We selected 2646 point sources from the 2XMM
catalogue at high galactic latitude (|BII| > 25 degrees) and with the sum of
EPIC-PN and EPIC-MOS 0.2-12 keV counts greater than 1000. Redshifts were
obtained for 916 sources from the NED. The final sample consists of 507 AGN.
Individual source spectra have been summed in the observed frame to compute the
integrated spectra in different redshift and luminosity bins over the range
0<z<5. Detailed analysis of these spectra has been performed. We find that the
narrow Fe K{\alpha} line at 6.4 keV is significantly detected up to z=1. The
line equivalent width decreases with increasing X-ray luminosity in the 2-10
keV band (''IT effect''). The anti-correlation is characterized by the relation
log(EWFe) = (1.66 +/- 0.09) + (-0.43 +/- 0.07) log(LX,44), where EWFe is the
rest frame equivalent width of the neutral iron K{\alpha} line in eV and LX,44
is the 2-10 keV X-ray luminosity in units of 10^{44} erg s^{-1}. The equivalent
width is nearly independent of redshift up to z ~ 0.8 with an average value of
101+/-40 (rms dispersion) eV in the luminosity range 43.5<= logLX <= 44.5. Our
analysis also confirmed the hardening of the spectral indices at low
luminosities implying a dependence of obscuration on luminosity. We confirm
that the neutral narrow Fe K{\alpha} line is an almost ubiquitous feature of
AGNs. We find compelling evidence for the ''IT effect'' over a redshift
interval larger than probed in any previous study. We detect no evolution of
the average rest frame equivalent width of the Fe K{\alpha} line with redshift.

transmitter has a finite partition of the set of states and knows which element
of the partition the actual state belongs to. The receiver may have arbitrary

transmitters have a common message and that each has an additional common
message. The second coding theorem is for the case where rate-constrained, but
noiseless transmitter cooperation is possible. This cooperation may be used to
exchange information about channel state information as well as the messages to
be transmitted. The cooperation protocol used here generalizes Willems'

enhancement. In particular, the coding theorem for the cooperative case shows
how much cooperation is necessary in order to achieve maximal capacity in the

in ferromagnetic body-centered cubic iron are investigated using the
all-electron full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave method based on the
generalized gradient approximation (GGA). We found that in general, the GGA
results are closer to the experimental values than those of the local spin
density approximation. The calculated formation enthalpy data indicate the
importance of a systematic study on the ternary Fe-C-$X$ systems rather than
the binary Fe-$X$ systems, in steel design. The lattice parameters are
optimized and the conditions for spin polarization at the impurity sites are
discussed in terms of the local Stoner model. Our calculations, which are
consistent with previous work, imply that the local spin-polarizations at Sc,
Ti, V, Cu, and Zn are induced by the host Fe atoms. The early transition-metal
atoms couple antiferromagnetically, while the late transition-metal atoms
couple ferromagnetically, to the host Fe atoms. The calculated total
magnetization ($M$) of bcc Fe is reduced by impurity elements from Sc to Cr as
a result of the antiferromagnetic interaction, with the opposite effect for
solutes which couple ferromagnetically. The changes in $M$ are attributed to
nearest neighbor interactions, mostly between the impurity and host atoms. The
atom averaged magnetic moment is shown to follow generally the well-known
Slater-Pauling curve, but our results do not follow the linearity of the
Slater-Pauling curve. We attribute this discrepancy to the weak ferromagnetic
nature of bcc Fe. The calculated Fermi contact hyperfine fields follow the
trend of the local magnetic moments. The effect of spin-orbit coupling is found
not to be significant although it comes into prominence at locations far from
the impurity sites.

quantum chromodynamics (QCD) towards a first-principle derivation of
confinement/deconfinement and chiral-symmetry breaking/restoration crossover
transitions. In fact, we demonstrate that an effective theory obtained using
simple but non-trivial approximations within this framework enables us to treat
both transitions simultaneously on equal footing. A resulting effective theory
is regarded as a modified and improved version of nonlocal Polyakov-loop
extended Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (nonlocal PNJL) models proposed recently by Hell,
R\""ossner, Cristoforetti and Weise, and Sasaki, Friman and Redlich, extending
the original (local) PNJL model by Fukushima and others. A novel feature is
that the nonlocal NJL coupling depends explicitly on the temperature and
Polyakov loop, which affects the entanglement between confinement and chiral
symmetry breaking, together with the cross term introduced through the
covariant derivative in the quark sector considered in the conventional PNJL
model. The chiral symmetry breaking/restoration transition is controlled by the
nonlocal NJL interaction, while the confinement/deconfinement transition in the
pure gluon sector is specified by the nonperturbative effective potential for
the Polyakov loop obtained recently by Braun, Gies, Marhauser and Pawlowski.
The basic ingredients are a reformulation of QCD based on new variables and the
flow equation of the Wetterich type in the Wilsonian renormalization group.
This framework can be applied to investigate the QCD phase diagram at finite
temperature and density.

collapse increases linearly from 0 to 1. This behavior is independent of
particle length, width, or aspect ratio. When the pile does collapse, the
runoff radius $r_f$ scales as a power-law with dimensionless height $\tilde H$,
agreeing with previous experiments on ordinary sand. For low piles the scaling
is linear, with $r_f\sim \tilde H^{1.2\pm 0.1}$. Above a critical pile aspect

dominated by an X-ray bright AGN, and although we derive a mass profile,
uncertainties are large and the constraints are significantly weakened due to
the presence of the central source. The total mass profile of RXCJ2315.7-0222
is of high quality, being measured in fifteen bins from [0.075 - 0.75]R500 and
containing three data points interior to 30 kpc, allowing comprehensive
investigation of its properties. We probe several mass models based on the
standard NFW profile or on the Sersic-like model recently suggested by
high-resolution N-body simulations. We find that the addition of a stellar
component due to the presence of the central galaxy is necessary for a good
analytical model fit. In all mass profile models fitted, the mass concentration
is not especially high compared to non-fossil systems. In addition, the
modification of the dark matter halo by adiabatic contraction slightly improves
the fit. However, our result depends critically on the choice of IMF used to
convert galaxy luminosity to mass, which leads to a degeneracy between the
central slope of the dark matter profile and the normalisation of the stellar
component. While we argue on the basis of the range of M_*/L_R ratios that
lower M_*/L_R ratios are preferred on physical grounds and that adiabatic
contraction has thus operated in this system, better theoretical and
observational convergence on this problem is needed to make further progess.

The internality of the measuring apparatus implies that different decomposition
of a given density operator for the internal measuring apparatus into mixture
of pure states may have different physical implications. We use `specified
mixed-state description' to call a density operator with a specified
decomposition into mixture of pure states. The proposed theory has three basic
assumptions, which roughly speaking have the following contents: (i) Physical
states of the total system can be associated with vectors in the total Hilbert
space; (ii) the dynamical evolution of a state vector obeys Schr\""{o}dinger
equation; and (iii) under a principle of compatible description and certain
non-transition condition, a pure-vector description of the total system may
imply the existence of certain specified mixed-state description. The principle
of compatible description states that different mathematical descriptions for
the same physical state of the total system must give consistent predictions
for results of measurements performed by the internal measuring apparatus. This
principle imposes a restriction to vectors in the Hilbert space and this may

theory on a Calabi-Yau manifold belongs to the so-called universal dilaton
hypermultiplet, that has four real scalars living on a quaternion-Kaehler
manifold. Requiring Heisenberg symmetry, which is a maximal subgroup of
perturbative isometries, reduces the possible manifolds to a one-parameter
family that describes the tree-level effective action deformed by the only
possible perturbative correction arising at one-loop level. A similar argument
can be made at the level of global supersymmetry where the scalar manifold is
hyper-Kaehler. In this work, the connection between global and local
supersymmetry is explicitly constructed, providing a non-trivial gravity
decoupled limit of type II strings already in perturbation theory.

$n$ labelled vertices with $m$ arcs, under a condition $m-n\to\infty$,
$m=O(n)$, is obtained; this solves a problem posed by Wright back in $1977$.
Our formula is a counterpart of a classic asymptotic formula, due to Bender,
Canfield and McKay, for the total number of connected undirected graphs on $n$
vertices with $m$ edges. A key ingredient of their proof was a recurrence
equation for the connected graphs count due to Wright. No analogue of Wright's
recurrence seems to exist for digraphs. In a previous paper with Nick Wormald
we rederived the BCM formula via counting two-connected graphs among the graphs
of minimum degree $2$, at least. In this paper, using a similar embedding for
directed graphs, we find an asymptotic formula, which includes an explicit
error term, for the fraction of strongly-connected digraphs with parameters $m$
and $n$ among all such digraphs with positive in/out-degrees.

describe how an internal geometric protoMom-structure can be constructed

reversal fields, and magnetization reversal processes, of well characterized
half-metallic epitaxial La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSMO) thin films grown onto SrTiO3
(STO) substrates with three different surface orientations, i.e. (001), (110)
and (1-18). The latter shows step edges oriented parallel to the [110]
(in-plane) crystallographic direction. Room temperature high resolution
vectorial Kerr magnetometry measurements have been performed at different
applied magnetic field directions in the whole angular range. In general, the
magnetic properties of the LSMO films can be interpreted with just the uniaxial
term with the anisotropy axis given by the film morphology, whereas the
strength of this anisotropy depends on both structure and film thickness. In
particular, LSMO films grown on nominally flat (110)-oriented STO substrates
presents a well defined uniaxial anisotropy originated from the existence of
elongated in-plane [001]-oriented structures, whereas LSMO films grown on
nominally flat (001)-oriented STO substrates show a weak uniaxial magnetic
anisotropy with the easy axis direction aligned parallel to residual substrate
step edges. Elongated structures are also found for LSMO films grown on vicinal
STO(001) substrates. These films present a well-defined uniaxial magnetic
anisotropy with the easy axis lying along the step edges and its strength
increases with the LSMO thickness. It is remarkable that this step-induced
uniaxial anisotropy has been found for LSMO films up to 120 nm thickness. Our
results are promising for engineering novel half-metallic magnetic devices that
exploit tailored magnetic anisotropy.
