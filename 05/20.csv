Lorentz and gauge symmetries, is considered. We start off by building up
Maxwell electrodynamics in (3+1)D from the assumption that the associated
Lagrangian is a gauge-invariant functional that depends on the electron and
photon fields and their first derivatives only. In this scenario, as
well-known, it is not possible to set up a Lorentz invariant gauge theory
containing a massive photon. We show nevertheless that there exist two
radically different electrodynamics, namely, the Chern-Simons and the Podolsky
formulations, in which this problem can be overcome. The former is only valid
in odd space-time dimensions, while the latter requires the presence of
higher-order derivatives of the gauge field in the Lagrangian. This theory,
usually known as Podolsky electrodynamics, is simultaneously gauge and Lorentz
invariant; in addition, it contains a massive photon. Therefore, a massive
photon, unlike the popular belief, can be adequately accommodated within the
context of a gauge-invariant electrodynamics.

the electronic scattering rate acquires a non-analytic contribution. This
invalidates basic assumptions of Fermi liquid theory and within perturbative
treatments leads to a non-Fermi liquid self-energy and transport
properties.Such anomalies are shown to also occur in the strongly correlated
metallic state. We consider the Hubbard model on a two-dimensional square
lattice with nearest and next-nearest neighbor hopping within the single-site
dynamical mean-field theory. At temperatures on the order of the low-energy
scale $T_0$ an unusual maximum emerges in the imaginary part of the self-energy
which is renormalized towards the Fermi level for finite doping. At zero
temperature this double-well structure is suppressed, but an anomalous energy
dependence of the self-energy remains. For the frustrated Hubbard model on the
square lattice with next-nearest neighbor hopping, the presence of the van Hove
singularity changes the asymptotic low temperature behavior of the resistivity
from a Fermi liquid to non-Fermi liquid dependency as function of doping. The
results of this work are discussed regarding their relevance for
high-temperature cuprate superconductors.

  Transterminator Flow","12 pages, 1 figure",,,,"astro-ph.EP physics.space-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Context: The superrotation phenomenon in the atmosphere on Venus has been
known since the late 60's. But until now no mechanism proposed has
satisfactorily explained this phenomenon. Objective: The aim of this research
is to propose a mechanism, until now never considered, which could drive the
atmosphere of Venus in its superrotation. This mechanism involves the transfer
of the transterminator ionospheric flow momentum to the lower atmosphere via
pressure waves generated in the cryosphere of Venus. The mechanism proposed
presents a source of energy sufficiently strong to allow the transfer of energy
despite dissipation. Method: The energy flow which transports the
transterminator flow and the energy lost by the viscosity in the superrotating
atmosphere were calculated. Both results were compared to establish if there is
sufficient energy in the transterminator flow to drive the superrotation.
Finally, the amplitude that the waves should have to be able to obtain the
momentum necessary to induce superrotation was calculated. Also an experimental
model was made presenting some similarities with the process described.
Results: The calculated power for the transterminator flow is 8.48x10e10 W. The
calculated viscous dissipation of the superrotating flow is 1.4x10e9 W.
Therefore, there is sufficient energy in the transterminator flow to maintain
superrotation. The amplitude of the waves generated in the cryosphere,
necessary to deposit the power dissipated by the viscous forces, is 10e-4 m for
waves of 1 Hz and 10e-8 m for waves of 10e4 Hz. These amplitudes imply that at
the altitude of the clouds on the night side there must be a constant sound of
83 dB. If the superrotation of Venus were to stop, with the continuous
injection of 1.4x10e9 W, the actual superrotation would appear again in
1.4x10e6 years.

the constraint on f_NL with Planck and HSC, the wide field galaxy survey is

\Delta f_NL ~ 20 for b_0 = 2 and \Delta f_NL ~ 10 for b_0 = 4, where b_0 is the
linear bias parameter. It is also found that future wide field galaxy survey

relativistic collisions of bubbles in the context of a multi-vacua potential

that scalar fields with only potential interactions behave like free fields
during high-speed collisions; the kick received by them in a collision can be
deduced simply by a linear superposition of the bubble wall profiles. This
process is equivalent to the scattering of solitons in 1+1 dimensions. We
deduce an expression for the field excursion (shortly after a collision), which
is related simply to the field difference between the parent and bubble vacua,
i.e. contrary to expectations, the excursion cannot be made arbitrarily large
by raising the collision energy. There is however a minimum energy threshold
for this excursion to be realized. We verify these predictions using a number
of 3+1 and 1+1 numerical simulations. A rich phenomenology follows from these
collision induced excursions - they provide a new mechanism for scanning the
landscape, they might end/begin inflation, and they might constitute our very
own big bang, leaving behind a potentially observable anisotropy.

probe the inner zones of an accretion disk. We find that the FRS is well
described by a single blackbody component with kT in a range 1.0-1.4 keV
responsible for the source variability in the frequency ranges 0.002-0.04 Hz,
and 0.07-0.3 Hz. We attribute this component to the accretion disk and possibly
emission from an existing boundary layer supported by radiation pressure. The
appearance of the blackbody component in the lower frequency ranges and
disappearance towards the higher frequencies suggests that it may also be a
disk-blackbody emission. We detect a different form of FRS for the higher
frequency ranges 0.9-6 Hz and 8-30 Hz which is modeled best with a power-law
and a Gaussian emission line at 6.4$^{+0.2}_{-0.3}$ keV with an equivalent
width of 1.6$^{+0.4}_{-1.2}$ keV and 1.3$^{+0.7}_{-0.9}$ keV for the two
frequency ranges, respectively. This iron fluorescence line detected in the
higher frequency ranges of spectra shows the existence of reflection in this

consistent with the previously detected $\sim$ 1 Hz QPO from this source

with metal-enhanced galactic winds can reproduce the properties of IC10. The
star formation must have proceeded in bursts rather than continuously and the
bursts must have been less numerous than ~10 over the whole galactic lifetime.
Finally, IC10 must have formed by a slow process of gas accretion with a
timescale of the order of 8 Gyr.

of the 3$\times$3 CKM elements and FCNC processes ($K$-, $D$-, $B_d$-,
$B_s$-mixing and the decay $b \to s \gamma$) we also investigate the
electroweak $S$, $T$, $U$ parameters, the angle $\gamma$ of the unitarity
triangle and the rare decay $B_s \to \mu^+ \mu^-$. Moreover we improve our
treatment of the QCD corrections compared to our previous analysis. We also
take leptonic contributions into account, but we neglect the mixing among
leptons. As a result we find that typically small mixing with the fourth family
is favored, but still some sizeable deviations from the SM3 results are not yet
excluded. The minimal possible value of $V_{tb}$ is 0.93. Also very large
CP-violating effects in $B_s$ mixing seem to be impossible within an extension
of the SM3 that consists of an additional fermion family alone. We find a
delicate interplay of electroweak and flavor observables, which strongly
suggests that a separate treatment of the two sectors is not feasible. In

nucleation of bubbles. These bubbles inevitably collide, and collisions
sometimes displace the field into a new minimum in a process known as a
classical transition. In this paper, we examine some new features of classical

junction condition formalism, we study the conditions for energy conservation
in detail, and solve explicitly for the types of allowed classical transition
geometries. We show that the repulsive nature of domain walls, and the de
Sitter expansion associated with a positive energy minimum, can allow for
classical transitions to vacua of higher energy than that of the colliding
bubbles. Transitions can be made out of negative or zero energy (terminal)
vacua to a de Sitter phase, re-starting eternal inflation, and populating new
vacua. However, the classical transition cannot produce vacua with energy
higher than the original parent vacuum, which agrees with previous results on
the construction of pockets of false vacuum. We briefly comment on the possible

model is made by analytical methods and reasoning. For any given site, the
extent to which a particle can diffuse is decided by the morphology in the
immediate neighbourhood of the site. An analytical expression is derived to
calculate the probability of a particle at any chosen site to diffuse to a
given length, from first principles. Using the method, the probabilities for
different diffusion lengths are calculated and their dependence on system size
and the number of deposited layers is studied. Numerical simulation of surface
diffusion in random deposition model with varying extents of diffusion are
performed and their results are interpreted in the light of the analytical
calculations. Thus, a clearer understanding of the diffusion process and the
effect of diffusion length on surface roughness is obtained. Systems with
surface diffusion show nearly random deposition-like behaviour upto monolayer
deposition. Their interface widths, in a logarithmic plot, are initially
linear, as in random deposition. With increase in the number of layers,
correlation effects between neighbouring columns become dominant. The interface
deviates from its initial linear growth and eventually becomes saturated. An
explanation for this behaviour is discussed and the point of departure from the
linear form is estimated analytically.

shuts down or never operated. Our model predicts that at a fixed planet mass,
dynamo history is sensitive to core size, but not to the initial inventory of
long-lived, heat-producing radionuclides. It predicts that rocky planets larger
than 2.5 Earth masses will not develop inner cores because the
temperature-pressure slope of the iron solidus becomes flatter than that of the
core adiabat. Instead, iron ""snow"" will condense near or at the top of these
cores, and the net transfer of latent heat upwards will suppress convection and
a dynamo. More massive planets can have anemic dynamos due to core cooling, but
only if they have mobile lids (plate tectonics). The lifetime of these dynamos

modify optical properties of surfaces of airless bodies. This explains why
spectra of the main belt asteroids, exposed to these `space weathering'
processes over eons, do not match the laboratory spectra of ordinary chondrite
(OC) meteorites. In contrast, an important fraction of Near Earth Asteroids
(NEAs), defined as Q-types in the asteroid taxonomy, display spectral
attributes that are a good match to OCs. Here we study the possibility that the
Q-type NEAs underwent recent encounters with the terrestrial planets and that
the tidal gravity (or other effects) during these encounters exposed fresh OC
material on the surface (thus giving it the Q-type spectral properties). We
used numerical integrations to determine the statistics of encounters of NEAs
to planets. The results were used to calculate the fraction and orbital
distribution of Q-type asteroids expected in the model as a function of the
space weathering timescale, t_sw (see main text for definition), and maximum
distance, r*, at which planetary encounters can reset the surface. We found
that t_sw ~ 1e6 yr (at 1 AU) and r* ~ 5 R_pl, where R_pl is the planetary
radius, best fit the data. Values t_sw < 1e5 yr would require that r* > 20
R_pl, which is probably implausible because these very distant encounters
should be irrelevant. Also, the fraction of Q-type NEAs would be probably much
larger than the one observed if t_sw > 1e7 yr. We found that t_sw ~ q^2, where
q is the perihelion distance, expected if the solar wind sputtering controls
t_sw, provides a better match to the orbital distribution of Q-type NEAs than
models with fixed t_sw. We also discuss how the Earth magnetosphere and
radiation effects such as YORP can influence the spectral properties of NEAs.

neutron star rotates at a frequency of ~517.9 Hz and is in a binary system with
an orbital period of 8.8 hrs and a projected semi-major axis of ~1.90 lt-s.
Assuming a neutron star between 0.8 and 2.2 M_o and using the mass function of
the system and the eclipse half-angle, we constrain the mass of the companion
and the inclination of the system to be in the ~0.46-0.81 M_o and
$\sim74.4^o-77.3^o range, respectively. To date, this is the tightest
constraint on the orbital inclination of any AMXP. As in other AMXPs, the pulse
profile shows harmonic content up to the 3rd overtone. However, this is the
first AMXP to show a 1st overtone with rms amplitudes between ~6% and ~23%,
which is the strongest ever seen, and which can be more than two times stronger

observations of the nearby poor X-ray cluster MZ 10451, in which both processes
can be studied in unprecedented detail. Chandra observations of the
intracluster medium (ICM) in the cluster core, which harbors two optically
bright early-type galaxies in the process of merging, show that the system has
retained a cool core and a central metal excess. This suggests that any
merger-induced ICM heating and mixing remain modest at this stage. Tidally
stripped stars seen around either galaxy likely represent an emerging
intracluster light component, and the central ICM abundance enhancement may
have a prominent contribution from in situ enrichment provided by these stars.
The smaller of the merging galaxies shows evidence for having retained a hot
gas halo, along with tentative evidence for some obscured star formation,
suggesting that not all BCG major mergers at low redshift are completely
dissipationless. Both galaxies are slightly offset from the peak of the ICM
emission, with all three lying on an axis that roughly coincides with the
large-scale elongation of the ICM. Our data are consistent with a picture in
which central BCGs are built up by mergers close to the cluster core, by
galaxies infalling on radial orbits aligned with the cosmological filaments

type II Cepheids in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). The sample consists of 43
objects, including 17 BL Her, 17 W Vir and 9 RV Tau stars (first examples ever
found in the SMC). Seven stars have been classified as peculiar W Vir stars - a
recently identified subclass of type II Cepheids. These stars have distinctive
light curves, are brighter and bluer than the ordinary W Vir variables. We
confirm that a large fraction of the peculiar W Vir stars are members of binary
systems.
  Three type II Cepheids exhibit eclipsing variations superimposed on the
pulsation light curves, and three other objects show long-period ellipsoidal
variability. All stars with the indication of binarity display secondary
periods which may be interpreted as amplitude and/or phase modulations of the
pulsation light curves with periods equal to the orbital periods or half the
orbital periods. We do not have any model for these modulations, however this
phenomenon rules out a possibility of the optical blends of a pulsating star
and a binary system.
  For each object the multi-epoch V- and I-band photometry collected over 8 or
13 years of observations and finding charts are available to the astronomical
community from the OGLE Internet archive.

initially confined fermionic quantum gas in the lowest band of a homogeneous
optical lattice. While we observe ballistic transport for non-interacting
atoms, even small interactions render the expansion almost bimodal with a
dramatically reduced expansion velocity. The dynamics is independent of the
sign of the interaction, revealing a novel, dynamic symmetry of the Hubbard

not satisfactorily accounted for by canonical stellar models. The same is true
for the measurements of these isotopes and of the $^{26}$Al/$^{27}$Al ratio in
presolar grains of circumstellar origin. Non-convective mixing, occurring
during both Red Giant Branch (RGB) and Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stages is
the explanation commonly invoked to account for the above evidence. Recently,
the need for such mixing phenomena on the AGB was questioned, and chemical
anomalies usually attributed to them were suggested to be formed in earlier
phases. We have therefore re-calculated extra-mixing effects in low mass stars
for both the RGB and AGB stages, in order to verify the above claims. Our
results contradict them; we actually confirm that slow transport below the
convective envelope occurs also on the AGB. This is required primarily by the
oxygen isotopic mix and the $^{26}$Al content of presolar oxide grains. Other
pieces of evidence exist, in particular from the isotopic ratios of carbon
stars of type N, or C(N), in the Galaxy and in the LMC, as well as of SiC
grains of AGB origin. We further show that, when extra-mixing occurs in the RGB
phases of population I stars above about 1.2 $M_{\odot}$, this consumes $^3$He
in the envelope, probably preventing the occurrence of thermohaline diffusion
on the AGB. Therefore, we argue that other extra-mixing mechanisms should be
active in those final evolutionary phases.

holes, the jets that they can produce and the medium in which they propagate.
Our main result is that traces of young stellar population are found at ~ 100
south of the nucleus. The contribution of a power-law continuum in the centre
is about 25%, which is expected if the light is scattered from a Seyfert 1

100 - 150 pc from the nucleus on both sides. They might be associated with
regions where the jet encounters dense clouds. Further support to this scenario
is given by the peaks of hot dust distribution found around these same regions
and the H2 emission line profile, leading us to propose that the peaks might be
associate to regions where stars are being formed. Hot dust also has an
important contribution to the nuclear region, reinforcing the idea of the
presence of a dense, circumnuclear torus in this galaxy. Cold dust appears
mostly in the south direction, which supports the view that the southwest

gradual changes, or drift, in the target concept. We define an algorithm to be
resistant to drift if, for some inverse polynomial drift rate in the target
function, it converges to accuracy 1 -- \epsilon , with polynomial resources,
and then stays within that accuracy indefinitely, except with probability
\epsilon , at any one time. We show that every evolution algorithm, in the
sense of Valiant (2007; 2009), can be converted using the Correlational Query
technique of Feldman (2008), into such a drift resistant algorithm. For certain
evolutionary algorithms, such as for Boolean conjunctions, we give bounds on
the rates of drift that they can resist. We develop some new evolution
algorithms that are resistant to significant drift. In particular, we give an
algorithm for evolving linear separators over the spherically symmetric
distribution that is resistant to a drift rate of O(\epsilon /n), and another
algorithm over the more general product normal distributions that resists a
smaller drift rate.
  The above translation result can be also interpreted as one on the robustness
of the notion of evolvability itself under changes of definition. As a second
result in that direction we show that every evolution algorithm can be
converted to a quasi-monotonic one that can evolve from any starting point
without the performance ever dipping significantly below that of the starting
point. This permits the somewhat unnatural feature of arbitrary performance
degradations to be removed from several known robustness translations.

show that, even with our low level of noise, scintillation due to turbulence in
Earth's atmosphere can produce large temperature swings in light-curve
inversions. Spurious periodic features in the ""reliable"" region of a wavelet
amplitude spectrum can exceed 0.3 K in our data. We also show that gravity-wave
model fits to noisy isothermal light curves can lead to convincing wave
""detections"". We provide new significance tests for localized wavelet
amplitudes, wave model fits, and global power spectra of inverted occultation
light curves by assessing the effects of pre- and post-occultation noise on

distributions provide a good way to estimate these parameters of interest since
they take into account the asymmetry of the likelihood surface in the case of
small and moderate sample sizes; however they are seldom used in practice. In
contrast, maximum likelihood asymptotic (mla) intervals are commonly used
without respect to sample size. It is shown here that profile likelihood
intervals actually are a good alternative for the estimation of quantiles for
sample sizes $25 \leq n\leq 100$ of block maxima, since they presented adequate
coverage frequencies in contrast to the poor coverage frequencies of mla
intervals for these sample sizes, which also tended to underestimate the
quantile and therefore might be a dangerous statistical practice.
  In addition, maximum likelihood estimation can present problems when Weibull
models are considered for moderate or small sample sizes due to singularities
of the corresponding density function when the shape parameter is smaller than
one. These estimation problems can be traced to the commonly used continuous
approximation to the likelihood function and could be avoided by using the
exact or correct likelihood function, at least for the settings considered
here. A rainfall data example is presented to exemplify the suggested
inferential procedure based on the analyses of profile likelihoods.

to encourage highly correlated outputs to share a common set of relevant
inputs. In addition, we propose a simple yet efficient proximal-gradient method
for optimizing GFlasso that can also be applied to any optimization problems
with a convex smooth loss and the general class of fusion penalty defined on
arbitrary graph structures. By exploiting the structure of the non-smooth
''fusion penalty'', our method achieves a faster convergence rate than the
standard first-order method, sub-gradient method, and is significantly more
scalable than the widely adopted second-order cone-programming and

staining, gram staining, optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and
atomic force microscopy were exploited to gain an insight into Bdellovibrio's
interaction with biofilms. Our experiments showed that B. bacteriovorus not
only consumes E. coli but also weakens the attachment of M. luteus to the solid
surface, rendering the biofilms susceptible to removal. B. bacteriovorus keeps
in check not only prey but also decoy bacterial populations in the surrounding
media, the latter probably via competition for nutrients. These experiments
encourage us to consider how B. bacteriovorus might be used to control biofilms
in the environment.

such as Venus. This mechanism is likely to constitute an important source of
tropospheric CO2 on Venus and could at least partly address the CO2 stability
problem in Venus' stratosphere, since our results suggest that atmospheric CO2
is produced from CO oxidation via surface hematite at a rate of 0.4 Petagrammes
(Pg) CO2 per (Earth) year on Venus which is about 45% of the mass loss of CO2
via photolysis in the Venusian stratosphere. We also investigated CO oxidation
via the hematite mechanism for a range of planetary scenarios and found that
modern Earth and Mars are probably too cold for the mechanism to be important
because the rate-limiting step, involving CO(g) reacting onto the hematite
surface, proceeds much slower at lower temperatures. The mechanism may feature
on extrasolar planets such as Gliese 581c or CoRoT-7b assuming they can
maintain solid surface hematite which e.g. starts to melt above about 1200K.
The mechanism may also be important for hot Hadean-type environments and for
the emerging class of hot Super-Earths with planetary surface temperatures
between about 600-900K.

have evolved. But life did evolve, which indicates that greenhouse gases must
have been present on early Earth to warm the planet. Evidence from the geologic
record indicates an abundance of the greenhouse gas CO2. CH4 was probably
present as well, and in this regard methanogenic bacteria, which belong to a
diverse group of anaerobic procaryotes that ferment CO 2 plus H2 to CH4, may
have contributed to modification of the early atmosphere. Molecular oxygen was
not present, as is indicated by the study of rocks from that era, which contain
iron carbonate rather than iron oxide. Multicellular organisms originated as
cells within colonies that became increasingly specialized. The development of
photosynthesis allowed the Sun's energy to be harvested directly by life forms.
The resultant oxygen accumulated in the atmosphere and formed the ozone layer
in the upper atmosphere. Aided by the absorption of harmful UV radiation in the
ozone layer, life colonized Earth's surface. Our own planet is a very good
example of how life forms modified the atmosphere over the planets' life time.
We show that these facts have to be taken into account when we discover and
characterize atmospheres of Earth-like exoplanets. If life has originated and
evolved on a planet, then it should be expected that a strong co-evolution
occurred between life and the atmosphere, the result of which is the planets'
climate.

system approach where the dynamic of the system and the reservoir fluctuations
are described through a density matrix whose evolution is defined by a Lindblad
rate equation. For each realization of the photon measurement processes it is
possible to define a conditional system state (stochastic density matrix) whose
evolution depends on both the photon detection events and the fluctuations
between the configurational states of the reservoir. In contrast to standard
fluorescent systems the photon-to-photon emission process is not a renewal one,
being defined by a (stochastic) waiting time distribution that in each
recording event parametrically depends on the conditional state. The formalism
allows calculating experimental observables such as the full hierarchy of joint
probabilities associated to the time intervals between consecutive photon
recording events. These results provide a powerful basis for characterizing
different situations arising in single-molecule spectroscopy, such as spectral
fluctuations, lifetime fluctuations, and light assisted processes.

competitive process in which each node strives to optimize its own
cost-communication balance. Three phases are observed in globally optimal
configurations for different cost-communication trade-offs: (i) regular small
worlds, (ii) star-like networks and (iii) trees with a centre of interconnected
hubs. In the latter regime, i.e. for very expensive wire, power laws in the
link length distributions $P(w)\propto w^{-\alpha}$ are found, which can be
explained by a hierarchical organization of the networks. In contrast, in the
local optimization process the presence of sharp transitions between different
network regimes depends on the dimension of the underlying space. Whereas for
$d=\infty$ sharp transitions between fully connected networks, regular small

probability < 0.01 percent that the RV oscillations attributed to CoRoT-7b and
CoRoT-7c are spurious effects of noise and activity. Additionally, our model

galaxies Abell 2256. We have observed A2256 at 150 MHz using the Giant
Metrewave Radio Telescope and successfully detected the diffuse radio halo and
the relic emission over an extent $\sim1.2$ Mpc$^2$. Using this 150 MHz image
and the images made using archival observations from the VLA (1369 MHz) and the
WSRT (350 MHz), we have produced spectral index images of the diffuse radio
emission in A2256. These spectral index images show a distribution of flat
spectral index (S$\propto\nu^\alpha$, $\alpha$ in the range -0.7 to -0.9)
plasma in the NW of the cluster centre. Regions showing steep spectral indices
($\alpha$ in the range -1.0 to -2.3) are toward the SE of the cluster centre.
These spectral indices indicate synchrotron life times for the relativistic
plasmas in the range 0.08 - 0.4 Gyr. We interpret this spectral behaviour as
resulting from a merger event along the direction SE to NW within the last 0.5
Gyr or so. A shock may be responsible for the NW relic in A2256 and the Mpc
scale radio halo towards the SE is likely to be generated by the turbulence
injected by mergers. Furthermore, the diffuse radio emission shows spectral
steepening toward lower frequencies. This low frequency spectral steepening is
consistent with a combination of spectra from two populations of relativistic
electrons created at two epochs (two mergers) within the last $\sim$0.5 Gyr.
Earlier interpretations of the X-ray and the optical data also suggested that
there were two mergers in Abell 2256 in the last 0.5 Gyr, consistent with the
current findings. Also highlighted in this study is the futility of correlating
the average temperatures of thermal gas and the average spectral indices of
diffuse radio emission in respective clusters.

notion of consistency over time. This notion can be informally introduced as
follows. At the very first time step $t_0$, the decision maker formulates an
optimization problem that yields optimal decision rules for all the forthcoming
time step $t_0, t_1, ..., T$; at the next time step $t_1$, he is able to
formulate a new optimization problem starting at time $t_1$ that yields a new
sequence of optimal decision rules. This process can be continued until final
time $T$ is reached. A family of optimization problems formulated in this way
is said to be time consistent if the optimal strategies obtained when solving
the original problem remain optimal for all subsequent problems. The notion of
time consistency, well-known in the field of Economics, has been recently
introduced in the context of risk measures, notably by Artzner et al. (2007)
and studied in the Stochastic Programming framework by Shapiro (2009) and for
Markov Decision Processes (MDP) by Ruszczynski (2009). We here link this notion
with the concept of ""state variable"" in MDP, and show that a significant class
of dynamic optimization problems are dynamically consistent, provided that an
adequate state variable is chosen.

Phys. 124, 064715 (2006)] revealed -for both types of ice- that H atom, OH, and
H2O desorption are the most important processes after photoexcitation in the
uppermost layers of the ice. Water desorption takes place either by direct
desorption of recombined water, or when, after dissociation, an H atom
transfers part of its kinetic energy to one of the surrounding water molecules
which is thereby kicked out from the ice. We present results of MD simulations
of UV photodissociation of amorphous ice at 10, 20, 30, and 90 K in order to
analyze the effect of ice temperature on UV photodissociation processes.
Desorption and trapping probabilities are calculated for photoexcitation of H2O
in the top four monolayers and the main conclusions are in agreement with the
10 K results: desorption dominates in the top layers, while trapping occurs
deeper in the ice. The hydrogen atom photodesorption probability does not
depend on ice temperature, but OH and H2O photodesorption probabilities tend to
increase slightly (~30%) with ice temperature. We have compared the total
photodesorption probability (OH+H2O) with the experimental total
photodesorption yield, and in both cases the probabilities rise smoothly with
ice temperature. The experimental yield is on average 3.8 times larger than our
theoretical results, which can be explained by the different time scales

Pleiades joins the open clusters M 34, the Hyades, IC 2602, and IC 2391, and
the Ursa Major moving group, demonstrating ostensible over-ionization trends.
The Pleiades deltaFe abundances are correlated with Ca II infrared triplet and
Halpha chromospheric emission indicators and relative differences therein.
Oxygen abundances of our Pleiades sample derived from the high-excitation O I
triplet have been previously shown to increase with decreasing Teff, and a
comparison with the deltaFe abundances suggests that the over-excitation
(larger abundances derived from high excitation lines relative to low
excitation lines) and over-ionization effects that have been observed in cool
open cluster and disk field main sequence (MS) dwarfs share a common origin.
Star-to-star Fe I abundances have low internal scatter, but the abundances of
stars with Teff < 5400 K are systematically higher compared to the warmer
stars. The cool star [Fe I/H] abundances cannot be connected directly to
over-excitation effects, but similarities with the deltaFe and O I triplet

of topological descriptions. However, it is still an open problem how to
identify the intrinsic multiple scales of networks. In this article, we
consider detecting the multi-scale community structure of network from the
perspective of dimension reduction. According to this perspective, a covariance
matrix of network is defined to uncover the multi-scale community structure
through the translation and rotation transformations. It is proved that the
covariance matrix is the unbiased version of the well-known modularity matrix.
We then point out that the translation and rotation transformations fail to
deal with the heterogeneous network, which is very common in nature and
society. To address this problem, a correlation matrix is proposed through
introducing the rescaling transformation into the covariance matrix. Extensive
tests on real world and artificial networks demonstrate that the correlation
matrix significantly outperforms the covariance matrix, identically the
modularity matrix, as regards identifying the multi-scale community structure
of network. This work provides a novel perspective to the identification of
community structure and thus various dimension reduction methods might be used
for the identification of community structure. Through introducing the
correlation matrix, we further conclude that the rescaling transformation is

lines of water (H2O) in emission, including a very high-lying (E_{upper}=640 K)
line detected at a 4sigma level, within the Herschel/SPIRE wavelength range,
whereas PACS observations show one H2O line at 78 microns in absorption, as
found for other H2O lines previously detected by ISO. The absorption/emission
dichotomy is caused by the pumping of the rotational levels by far-infrared
radiation emitted by dust, and subsequent relaxation through lines at longer
wavelengths, which allows us to estimate both the column density of H2O and the
general characteristics of the underlying far-infrared continuum source.
Radiative transfer models including excitation through both absorption of
far-infrared radiation emitted by dust and collisions are used to calculate the
equilibrium level populations of H2O and the corresponding line fluxes. The
highest-lying H2O lines detected in emission, with levels at 300-640 K above
the ground state, indicate that the source of far-infrared radiation
responsible for the pumping is compact (radius=110-180 pc) and warm
(T_{dust}=85-95 K), accounting for at least 45% of the bolometric luminosity.
The high column density, N(H2O)~5x10^{17} cm^{-2}, found in this nuclear
component, is most probably the consequence of shocks/cosmic rays, an XDR
chemistry, and/or an ""undepleted chemistry"" where grain mantles are evaporated.
A more extended region, presumably the inner region of the 1-kpc disk observed
in other molecular species, could contribute to the flux observed in low-lying
H2O lines through dense hot cores, and/or shocks. The H2O 78 micron line
observed with PACS shows hints of a blue-shifted wing seen in absorption,

new methodology to the problem of the dark energy equation of state, comparing
an absolute upper bound on the Bayesian evidence for a presently unknown dark

at a 2.5{\sigma} level. We detect extra absorption in the Mg II

2.18+/-0.18 RJ, and 2.66+/-0.22 RJ respectively, suggesting the planet is
surrounded by an absorbing cloud which overfills the Roche lobe. We detect
enhanced transit depths at the wavelengths of resonance lines of neutral
sodium, tin, and manganese, and at singly ionized ytterbium, scandium,
manganese, aluminum, vanadium, and magnesium. We also find the statistically
expected number of anomalous transit depths at wavelengths not associated with

whole the results are strong evidence for an extended absorbing exosphere

random renewal process [Birkner, Greven and den Hollander, Probab. Theory

These variational formulas are used to obtain a necessary and sufficient
criterion, stated in terms of relative entropies, for the two critical curves
to be different at a given inverse temperature, a property referred to as
relevance of the disorder. This criterion in turn is used to show that the
regimes of relevant and irrelevant disorder are separated by a unique inverse
critical temperature. Subsequently, upper and lower bounds are derived for the
inverse critical temperature, from which sufficient conditions under which it
is strictly positive, respectively, finite are obtained. The former condition
is believed to be necessary as well, a problem that we will address in a
forthcoming paper. Random pinning has been studied extensively in the
literature. The present paper opens up a window with a variational view. Our
variational formulas for the quenched and the annealed critical curve are new

technologies, ranging from quantum information to quantum imaging. This last
field is addressed to overcome limits of classical imaging by exploiting
specific properties of quantum states of light. One of the most interesting
proposed scheme exploits spatial quantum correlations between twin beams for
realizing sub-shot-noise imaging of the weak absorbing objects, leading ideally
to a noise-free imaging. Here we discuss in detail the experimental realization
of this scheme, showing its capability to reach a larger signal to noise ratio
with respect to classical imaging methods and, therefore, its interest for
future practical applications.

understanding the solar dynamo and the acceleration of solar wind. We carried
out precise magnetic observations on both the North polar region and the quiet
Sun at the East limb with the Spectro-Polarimeter of the Solar Optical
Telescope aboard Hinode to characterize the polar region with respect to the
quiet Sun. The average area and the total magnetic flux of the kG magnetic
concentrations in the polar region appear to be larger than those of the quiet
Sun. The magnetic field vectors classified as vertical in the quiet Sun have
symmetric histograms around zero in the strengths, showing balanced positive
and negative flux, while the histogram in the North polar region is clearly
asymmetric, showing a predominance of the negative polarity. The total magnetic
flux of the polar region is larger than that of the quiet Sun. In contrast, the
histogram of the horizontal magnetic fields is exactly the same between the
polar region and the quiet Sun. This is consistent with the idea that a local
dynamo process is responsible for the horizontal magnetic fields. A
high-resolution potential field extrapolation shows that the majority of
magnetic field lines from the kG-patches in the polar region are open with a
fanning-out structure very low in the atmosphere, while in the quiet Sun,
almost all the field lines are closed.

Unlike most previous formulations which rely on surrogate convex loss functions

time/sample guarantees with respect to the more natural zero-one loss function.
The proposed algorithm can learn kernel-based halfspaces in worst-case time
$\poly(\exp(L\log(L/\epsilon)))$, for $\emph{any}$ distribution, where $L$ is a
Lipschitz constant (which can be thought of as the reciprocal of the margin),
and the learned classifier is worse than the optimal halfspace by at most
$\epsilon$. We also prove a hardness result, showing that under a certain
cryptographic assumption, no algorithm can learn kernel-based halfspaces in
time polynomial in $L$.

stellar orbital eccentricity in a galaxy halo, assuming that the stars
constitute a spherical, collisionless system in dynamical equilibrium with a
dark matter halo. In order to define the eccentricity e of a halo star for
given energy E and angular momentum L, we adopt two types of gravitational
potential, such as an isochrone potential and a Navarro-Frenk-White potential,
that could form two ends covering in-between any realistic potential of dark
matter halo. Based on a distribution function of the form f(E,L) that allows
constant anisotropy in velocity dispersions characterized by a parameter \beta,
we find that the eccentricity distribution is a monotonically increasing
function of e for the case of highly radially anisotropic velocity dispersions
(\beta > 0.6), while showing a hump-like shape for the cases from radial
through tangential velocity anisotropy (\beta < 0.6). We also find that when
the velocity anisotropy agrees with that observed for the Milky Way halo stars
(\beta = 0.5-0.7), a nearly linear eccentricity distribution of N(e) \alpha e
results at e < 0.7, largely independent of the potential adopted. Our
theoretical eccentricity distribution would be a vital tool of examining how
far out in the halo the dynamical equilibrium has been achieved, through
comparison with kinematics of halo stars sampled at greater distances. Given
that large surveys of the SEGUE and Gaia projects would be in progress, we
discuss how our results would serve as a new guide in exploring the formation

constraints induced by Heisenberg commutation relations bloke the transfer of

about acceleration mechanisms occurring in their innermost regions. Studies of
variability in these objects allow a better understanding of the mechanisms at
play. To investigate the spectral and temporal variability of VHE (>100 GeV)
gamma-rays of the well-known high-frequency-peaked BL Lac object PKS 2155-304
with the H.E.S.S. imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes over a wide range of
flux states. Data collected from 2005 to 2007 are analyzed. Spectra are derived
on time scales ranging from 3 years to 4 minutes. Light curve variability is
studied through doubling timescales and structure functions, and is compared
with red noise process simulations. The source is found to be in a low state
from 2005 to 2007, except for a set of exceptional flares which occurred in
July 2006. The quiescent state of the source is characterized by an associated
mean flux level of 4.32 +/-0.09 x 10^-11 cm^-2 s^-1 above 200 GeV, or
approximately 15% of the Crab Nebula, and a power law photon index of 3.53
+/-0.06. During the flares of July 2006, doubling timescales of ~2 min are
found. The spectral index variation is examined over two orders of magnitude in
flux, yielding different behaviour at low and high fluxes,which is a new
phenomenon in VHE gamma-ray emitting blazars. The variability amplitude
characterized by the fractional r.m.s. is strongly energy-dependent and is
proportional to E^(0.19 +/- 0.01). The light curve r.m.s. correlates with the
flux. This is the signature of a multiplicative process which can be accounted
for as a red noise with a Fourier index of ~2. This unique data set shows
evidence for a low level gamma-ray emission state from PKS 2155-304, which
possibly has a different origin than the outbursts. The discovery of the light
curve lognormal behaviour might be an indicator ..

characterized by a zero Schwarzschild mass. In fact, in that case, none
gravastar was formed and the shell expanded, leaving behind a de Sitter or a
Minkowski spacetime, or collapsed without forming an event horizon, originating
what we called a massive non-gravitational object. This object has two
components of non zero mass but the exterior spacetime is Minkowski or de
Sitter. One of the component is a massive thin shell and the other one is de
Sitter spacetime inside. The total mass of this object is zero Schwarzschild
mass, which characterizes an exterior vacuum spacetime. Here, we extend this
study to the case where we have a charged shell. Now, the exterior is a
Reissner-Nordstr\""om spacetime and, depending on the parameter
$\omega=1-\gamma$ of the equation of state of the shell, and the charge, a
gravastar structure can be formed. We have found that the presence of the
charge contributes to the stability of the gravastar, if the charge is greater
than a critical value. Otherwise, a massive non-gravitational object is formed
for small charges.

significantly weakens predictions for growth from measured distances, for
quintessence there is a generic limit on the growth evolution that could be

both absorption and scattering by ice grains. Water ice in YLW 16A is detected
with optical depths of between tau=1.8 and tau=2.5. The profiles that are
measured can be fitted predominantly by the extinction profiles of small grains
(0.1um - 0.3um) with a small contribution from large grains (<10%). However, an
unambiguous trace of grain growth cannot be found. We detected crystallized
water ice spectra that have their origin in different regions of the

increases in the upper layers of the circumstellar disk, while only amorphous

impossible due to the many sources of noise present in the terrestrial

time variation of the gravitational ""constant"" G and for violations of the weak

derivatives to a certain degree C(k). We call it a k-smooth function or a
smooth function if k can grow infinitively. Based on quantum physics, there is
no such smooth surface in the real world on a very small scale. However, we do
have a concept of smooth surfaces in practice since we always compare whether
one surface is smoother than another one. This paper deals with the possible
definitions of ""natural"" smoothness and their relationship to the original
mathematical definition of smooth functions. The motivation of giving the
definition of a smooth function is to study smooth extensions for practical
applications.
  We observe this problem from two directions: From discrete to continuous, we
suggest considering both micro smooth, the refinement of a smoothed function,
and macro smooth, the best approximation using existing discrete space. (For
two-dimensional or higher dimensional cases, we can use Hessian matrices.) From
continuous to discrete, we suggest a new definition of natural smooth, it uses
a scan from down scaling to up scaling to obtain the a ratio for sign changes
by ignoring zero to represent the smoothness. For differentiable functions,
mathematical smoothness does not mean a ""good looking"" smooth for a sampled set
in discrete space. Finally, we discuss the Lipschitz continuity for defining
the smoothness, which will be called discrete smoothness. This paper gives
philosophical consideration of smoothness for practical problems, rather than a
mathematical deduction or reduction, even though our inferences are based on
solid mathematics.

signals with noisy measurements, the known bounds on the achievable sparsity

neighborly polytope analysis which yields sharp bounds for ideally sparse

from a necessary and sufficient condition, the ""balancedness"" property of

(\varphi_{\alpha})\right)^{-1}$ where $T_{N} (\varphi_{\alpha})$ is a Toeplitz
matrix with symbol $\varphi_{\alpha}$. Then we extend a result of A. B\""ottcher
and H. Widom result related to the minimal eigenvalue of the Toeplitz matrix
$T_{N}(\varphi_{\alpha})$. For $N$ goes to the infinity it is well known that
this minimal eigenvalue admit as asymptotic $\frac{c_{\alpha}}{N^{2\alpha}}
f_{1}(1)$. When $\alpha\in \nn$ the previous authors obtain an asymptotic of
$c_{\alpha}$ for $\alpha$ going to the infinity, and they have the bounds of
$c_{\alpha}$ for the other cases. Here we obtain the same type of results but
for $\alpha$ a positive real.

scheme to study small current fluctuations of mesoscopic systems at milliKelvin
temperatures. The setup relies on the combination of an interferometric ampli-
fication scheme and a quarter-wave impedance transformer, allowing the mea-
surement of noise power spectral densities with GHz bandwith up to five orders
of magnitude below the amplifier noise floor. We simultaneously measure the
high frequency conductance of the sample by derivating a portion of the signal
to a microwave homodyne detection. We describe the principle of the setup, as
well as its implementation and calibration. Finally, we show that our setup
allows to fully characterize a subnanosecond on-demand single electron source.
More generally, its sensitivity and bandwith make it suitable for applications
manipulating single charges at GHz frequencies.
