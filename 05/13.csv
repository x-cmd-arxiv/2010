respect to the introduction of the stochastic perturbation of the dynamics. It
is shown that such a dependence can be thought in terms of the isomorphism of
the Vicsek model with the Kuramoto model of spontaneous synchronization. They
are isomorphic at least within the mean-field approach. The isomorphism between
two models allows to state the dependence of the type of the transition in
Vicsek model on the noise perturbation. Two types of noise the scalar and the
vector ones lead to qualitatively different behavior with continuous and the
discontinuous transition to ordered state correspondingly. New type of the
stochastic perturbation - ``mixed`` noise is proposed. It is the weighted
superposition of the scalar and vector noises. The corresponding phase diagram
``noise amplitude vs. interaction strength`` is obtained and the tricritical
behavior for Vicsek model is demonstrated.

090510 made with the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) and Large Area Telescope

the LAT that shows strong evidence for a deviation from a Band spectral fitting
function during the prompt emission phase. The time-integrated spectrum is fit
by the sum of a Band function with $\Epeak = 3.9\pm 0.3$\,MeV, which is the
highest yet measured, and a hard power-law component with photon index
$-1.62\pm 0.03$ that dominates the emission below $\approx$\,20\,keV and above
$\approx$\,100\,MeV. The onset of the high-energy spectral component appears to
be delayed by $\sim$\,0.1\,s with respect to the onset of a component well fit
with a single Band function. A faint GBM pulse and a LAT photon are detected
0.5\,s before the main pulse. During the prompt phase, the LAT detected a
photon with energy $30.5^{+5.8}_{-2.6}$ GeV, the highest ever measured from a
short GRB. Observation of this photon sets a minimum bulk outflow Lorentz
factor, $\Gamma\ga$\,1200, using simple $\gamma\gamma$ opacity arguments for
this GRB at redshift $z = 0.903$ and a variability time scale on the order of
tens of ms for the $\approx$\,100\,keV--few MeV flux. Stricter high confidence
estimates imply $\Gamma \ga 1000$ and still require that the outflows powering
short GRBs are at least as highly relativistic as those of long duration GRBs.
Implications of the temporal behavior and power-law shape of the additional
component on synchrotron/synchrotron self-Compton (SSC), external-shock
synchrotron, and hadronic models are considered.

self-avoiding closed loops existing in any random system at any temperature. An
interface excitation state is a vector with 8 orders of additional restoring
torque, 8 orders of relaxation times, quantized energies and extra volumes.
Dynamics occurred by the slow inverse cascade generates the 8 orders of
potential loop-flows while the fast cascade rearranges the structure. The
delocalization mode is solitary wave along the 8 orders of geodesic. Solitary
wave is derived from the balance between inverse cascade and cascade.
Increasing temperature only increases the number of inverse cascade and

the NRs expand in the bulk superconducting state consisted of inhomogeneities.
The fact that the size of the inhomogeneity [2] is close to the minimal size of
the NR [1] leads to a conclusion that the superconducting phase is a result of
these overlapped NRs. In the present paper we perform the charge and
percolation regime analysis of NRs and show that at the first critical doping
x_{c1}, when the superconductivity starts on, each NR carries the positive
electric charge one in units of electron charge, thus we attribute the NR to a
single hole boson, and the percolation lines connecting these bosons emerge. At
the second critical doping x_{c2}, when the superconductivity disappears, our
analysis demonstrates that the charge of each NR equals two. The origin of
x_{c2} can be understood by introducing additional normal phase hole fermions
in NRs, whose concentration appearing above x_{c1} increases smoothly with the
doping and breaks the percolation lines of bosons at x_{c2}. The last one
results in disappearing the bulk bosonic property of the pseudogap (PG) region,
which explains the upper bound for existence of vortices in Nernst effect [3].
Since [1] has demonstrated the absence of NRs at the PG boundary one can
conclude that along this boundary, as well as in x_{c2}, all bosons disappear.

including low-mass ellipticals and spiral (true) bulges. These models satisfy
the mass-metallicity and the mass-[alpha/Fe] relations. The typical metallicity
gradients predicted by our models have a slope of -0.3 dex per decade variation
in radius, consistent with the mean values of several observational samples.
However, we also find a few quite massive galaxies in which this slope is -0.5
dex per decade, in agreement with some recent data. In particular, we find a
mild dependence from the mass tracers when we transform the stellar abundance
gradients into radial variations of the Mg_2 line-strength index, but not in
the Mg_b. We conclude that, rather than a mass- slope relation, is more
appropriate to speak of an increase in the scatter of the gradient slope with
the galactic mass. We can explain such a behaviour with different efficiencies
of star formation in the framework of the revised monolithic formation
scenario, hence the scatter in the observed gradients should not be used as an
evidence of the need of mergers. Indeed, model galaxies that exhibit the
steepest gradient slopes are preferentially those with the highest star
formation efficiency at that given mass.

factor applicable to diffuse but partially-molecular ISM when H2 and CO are
present but C+ is the dominant form of gas-phase carbon.
  Methods: We discuss galactic lines of sight observed in \HI, HCO+ and CO
where CO emission is present but the intervening clouds are diffuse (locally
\AV\ $\la 1$ mag) with relatively small CO column densities $\NCO \la
2\times10^{16}\pcc$. We separate the atomic and molecular fractions
statistically using \EBV\ as a gauge of the total gas column density and
compare NH2 to the observed CO brightness.
  Results: Although there are H2-bearing regions where CO emission is too faint
to be detected, the mean ratio of integrated CO brightness to NH2 for diffuse
ISM does not differ from the usual value of 1\K km/s of integrated CO
brightness per $2\times10^{20}$ H2 $\pcc$ . Moreover, the luminosity of diffuse
CO viewed perpendicular to the galactic plane is 2/3 that seen at the Solar
galactic radius in surveys of CO emission near the galactic plane.
  Conclusions: Commonality of the CO-H2 conversion factors in diffuse and dark
clouds can be understood from considerations of radiative transfer and CO
chemistry. There is unavoidable confusion between CO emission from diffuse and
dark gas and misattribution of CO emission from diffuse to dark or giant
molecular clouds. The character of the ISM is different from what has been
believed if CO and H2 that have been attributed to molecular clouds on the
verge of star formation are actually in more tenuous, gravitationally-unbound
diffuse gas.

nuclear point source (presumed to be the location of the supermassive black
hole, SMBH) and the photo-center of the galaxy. The displacement is along a
position angle of 307 +/- 17 degrees and is consistent with the jet axis. This
suggests the active SMBH in M87 does not currently reside at the galaxy center
of mass, but is displaced in the counter-jet direction. Possible explanations
for the displacement include orbital motion of an SMBH binary, gravitational
perturbations due to massive objects (e.g., globular clusters), acceleration by
an asymmetric or intrinsically one-sided jet, and gravitational recoil
resulting from the coalescence of an SMBH binary. The displacement direction
favors the latter two mechanisms. However, jet asymmetry is only viable, at the
observed accretion rate, for a jet age of >0.1 Gyr and if the galaxy restoring
force is negligible. This could be the case in the low density core of M87. A
moderate recoil ~1 Myr ago might explain the disturbed nature of the nuclear
gas disk, could be aligned with the jet axis, and can produce the observed
offset. Alternatively, the displacement could be due to residual oscillations
resulting from a large recoil that occurred in the aftermath of a major merger
any time in the last 1 Gyr.

describing the canonical scalar field. Such a model will be ruled out, if the

  We investigate the Caltech-Jodrell Bank flat-spectrum (CJF) sample for
evidence in favor of the merger-driven evolution scheme of active galaxies and
search tracer-systems of AGN evolution and possible indications of BBH
candidates. We discuss the validity and ambiguity of such indications and

morphological information of the CJF sources. We analyze the statistics of this

patterns in a large directed graph. Specifically, a blackhole pattern is a
group which is made of a set of nodes in a way such that there are only inlinks
to this group from the rest nodes in the graph. In contrast, a volcano pattern
is a group which only has outlinks to the rest nodes in the graph. Both
patterns can be observed in real world. For instance, in a trading network, a
blackhole pattern may represent a group of traders who are manipulating the
market. In the paper, we first prove that the blackhole mining problem is a
dual problem of finding volcanoes. Therefore, we focus on finding the blackhole
patterns. Along this line, we design two pruning schemes to guide the blackhole
finding process. In the first pruning scheme, we strategically prune the search
space based on a set of pattern-size-independent pruning rules and develop an
iBlackhole algorithm. The second pruning scheme follows a divide-and-conquer
strategy to further exploit the pruning results from the first pruning scheme.
Indeed, a target directed graphs can be divided into several disconnected
subgraphs by the first pruning scheme, and thus the blackhole finding can be
conducted in each disconnected subgraph rather than in a large graph. Based on
these two pruning schemes, we also develop an iBlackhole-DC algorithm. Finally,
experimental results on real-world data show that the iBlackhole-DC algorithm
can be several orders of magnitude faster than the iBlackhole algorithm, which
has a huge computational advantage over a brute-force method.

N gauge theory (bosonic BFSS type model) as a first step. This model is
obtained through a dimensional reduction of a 1+D dimensional SU(N) Yang-Mills
theory and we use a 1/D expansion to investigate the phase structure. We find
three phases in the \mu-T plane. We also show that all the adjoint scalars
condense at large D and obtain a mass dynamically. This dynamical mass protects
our model from the usual perturbative instability of massless scalars in a
non-zero chemical potential. We find that the system is at least meta-stable
for arbitrary large values of the chemical potentials in D \to \infty limit. We
also explore the existence of similar condensation in higher dimensional gauge
theories in a high temperature limit. In 2 and 3 dimensions, the condensation
always happens as in one dimensional case. On the other hand, if the dimension
is higher than 4, there is a critical chemical potential and the condensation
happens only if the chemical potentials are below it.

(star-formation rate) or the total infrared luminosity from just one infrared
band. However these relations are generally derived for entire galaxies, which
are known to contain a large scale diffuse emission that is not necessarily
related to the latest star-formation episode. We provide new relations to
estimate the SFR from resolved star-forming regions at 100 mum and 160 mum. We
select individual star-forming regions in the nearby (840 kpc) galaxy M33. We
estimate the SFR combining the emission in Halpha and at 24 mum to calibrate
the emission at 100 mum and 160 mum as SFR estimators, as mapped with
PACS/Herschel. The data are obtained in the framework of the HERM33ES open time
key project. There is less emission in the HII regions at 160 mum than at 100
mum. Over a dynamic range of almost 2 dex in Sigma(SFR) we find that the 100
mum emission is a nearly linear estimator of the SFR, whereas that at 160 mum
is slightly superlinear. The behaviour of individual star-forming regions is
surprisingly similar to that of entire galaxies. At high Sigma(SFR), star
formation drives the dust temperature, whereas uncertainties and variations in
radiation-transfer and dust-heated processes dominate at low Sigma(SFR).
Detailed modelling of both galaxies and individual star forming regions will be
needed to interpret similarities and differences between the two and assess the
fraction of diffuse emission in galaxies.

semi-major axis of 0.0172 AU, its origins may be unlike any rocky planet in our
solar system. In this study, we consider the roles of tidal evolution and
evaporative mass loss in CoRoT-7 b's history, which together have modified the
planet's mass and orbit. If CoRoT-7 b has always been a rocky body, evaporation
may have driven off almost half its original mass, but the mass loss may depend
sensitively on the extent of tidal decay of its orbit. As tides caused CoRoT-7
b's orbit to decay, they brought the planet closer to its host star, thereby
enhancing the mass loss rate. Such a large mass loss also suggests the
possibility that CoRoT-7 b began as a gas giant planet and had its original
atmosphere completely evaporated. In this case, we find that CoRoT-7 b's
original mass probably didn't exceed 200 Earth masses (about 2/3 of a Jupiter
mass). Tides raised on the host star by the planet may have significantly
reduced the orbital semi-major axis, perhaps causing the planet to migrate
through mean-motion resonances with the other planet in the system, CoRoT-7 c.
The coupling between tidal evolution and mass loss may be important not only
for CoRoT-7 b but also for other close-in exoplanets, and future studies of
mass loss and orbital evolution may provide insight into the origin and fate of
close-in planets, both rocky and gaseous.

galaxy formation and evolution studies as well as for models describing these
processes. Determining the local luminosity function in the submillimeter range
can help to better constrain in particular the bolometric luminosity density in
the local Universe, and Herschel offers the first opportunity to do so in an
unbiased way by imaging large sky areas at several submillimeter wavelengths.
  We present the first Herschel measurement of the submillimeter 0<z<0.2 local
luminosity function and infrared bolometric (8-1000 $\mu$m) local luminosity
density based on SPIRE data from the HerMES Herschel Key Program over 14.7
deg^2.
  Flux measurements in the three SPIRE channels at 250, 350 and 500 \mum are
combined with Spitzer photometry and archival data. We fit the observed
optical-to-submillimeter spectral energy distribution of SPIRE sources and use
the 1/V_{max} estimator to provide the first constraints on the monochromatic
250, 350 and 500 \mum as well as on the infrared bolometric (8-1000 \mum) local
luminosity function based on Herschel data.
  We compare our results with modeling predictions and find a slightly more
abundant local submillimeter population than predicted by a number of models.
Our measurement of the infrared bolometric (8-1000 \mum) local luminosity
function suggests a flat slope at low luminosity, and the inferred local
luminosity density, 1.31_-0.21^+0.24 x 10^8 Lsun Mpc^-3, is consistent with the

dependent coupling between the dark energy component driving the present
accelerated expansion of the Universe and the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) fluid.
Depending on the functional form of the coupling strength, these models show a
range of possible intermediate behaviors between the standard LCDM background
evolution and the widely studied case of interacting dark energy models with a
constant coupling. These different background evolutions play a crucial role in
the growth of cosmic structures, and determine strikingly different effects of
the coupling on the internal dynamics of nonlinear objects. By means of a
suitable modification of the cosmological N-body code GADGET-2 we have
performed a series of high-resolution N-body simulations of structure formation
in the context of interacting dark energy models with variable couplings.
Depending on the type of background evolution, the halo density profiles are
found to be either less or more concentrated with respect to LCDM, contrarily
to what happens for constant coupling models where concentrations can only
decrease. However, for some specific choice of the interaction function the
reduction of halo concentrations can be larger than in constant coupling
scenarios. In general, we find that time dependent interactions between dark
energy and CDM can in some cases determine stronger effects on structure
formation as compared to the constant coupling case, with a significantly
weaker impact on the background evolution of the Universe, and might therefore
provide a more viable possibility to alleviate the tensions between
observations and the LCDM model on small scales than the constant coupling
scenario. [Abridged]

specifically S(250)/S(70) vs. S(70)/S(24) - quite clearly separate them from
the non-AGN, star-forming galaxy population, as their 24-um flux is dominated
by the hot torus emission. However, their SPIRE colours alone do not differ
from those of non-AGN galaxies. SED fitting shows that all those AGN need a
starburst component to fully account for their FIR emission. For objects at z >
2, we find a correlation between the infrared luminosity attributed to the
starburst component, L(SB), and the AGN accretion luminosity, L(acc), with
L(SB) propto L(acc)^0.35. Type 2 AGN detected at 250um show on average higher
L(SB) than type 1 objects but their number is still too low to establish
whether this trend indicates stronger star-formation activity.

(MHD) instabilities may operate at all radii within an intracluster medium
(ICM), and profoundly affect the structure of a cluster's magnetic field. Where
MHD instabilities dominate the dynamics of an ICM, they will re-orient magnetic
field lines perpendicular to the temperature gradient inside a cooling core, or
parallel to the temperature gradient outside it. This characteristic structure
of magnetic field could be probed by measurements of polarized radio emission
from background sources. Motivated by this possibility we have constructed 3-d
models of a magnetized cooling core cluster and calculated Faraday rotation
measure (RM) maps in the plane of the sky under realistic observing conditions.
We compare a scenario in which magnetic field geometry is characterized by
conduction driven MHD instabilities to that where it is determined by isotropic
turbulent motions. We find that future high-sensitivity spectro-polarimetric
measurements of RM, such as will be enabled by the Expanded Very Large Array
and Square Kilometer Array can distinguish between these two cases with
plausible exposure times. Such observations will test the existence of
conduction-driven MHD instabilities in dynamically relaxed cooling core
clusters. More generally, our findings imply that observations of Faraday RM
should be able to discern physical mechanisms that result in qualitatively
different magnetic field topologies, without a priori knowledge about the
nature of the processes.

multiple oscillating inflatons makes parametric resonance inefficient in the

permit a complete decay of the inflaton for this coupling. In order to recover
the hot big bang, we must instead consider trilinear couplings. In this case we
show that strong nonperturbative preheating is possible via multi-field

a complete list of resolution graphs of weighted homogeneous complex surface

with Milnor number 0. They fall into several classes, the most interesting of
which are the three classes whose resolution dual graph has central vertex with
valency 4. We give a uniform ""quotient construction"" of the QHD smoothings for
these classes; it is an explicit Q-Gorenstein smoothing, yielding a precise
description of the Milnor fibre and its non-abelian fundamental group. This had
already been done for two of these classes in a previous paper; what is new
here is the construction of the third class, which is far more difficult. In
addition, we explain the existence of two different QHD smoothings for the
first class.
  We also prove a general formula for the dimension of a QHD smoothing
component for a rational surface singularity. A corollary is that for the
valency 4 cases, such a component has dimension 1 and is smooth. Another
corollary is that ""most"" H-shaped resolution graphs cannot be the graph of a
singularity with a QHD smoothing. This result, plus recent work of

been fruitful for both theory and experiment. Yet the choice of the reaction

problem. We analyze extensive simulation data of an alpha-helix in explicit
water solvent as it stochastically folds and unfolds. The free energy profiles
for different RCs exhibit significant variation, some having an activation
barrier, others not. We show that this variation has little effect on the
predicted folding kinetics if the diffusivity profiles are properly taken into
account. This kinetic quasi-universality is rationalized by an RC rescaling,
which, due to the reparameterization invariance of the Fokker-Planck equation,
allows the combination of free energy and diffusivity effects into a single
function, the rescaled free energy profile. This rescaled free energy indeed
shows less variation among different RCs than the bare free energy and
diffusivity profiles separately do, if we properly distinguish between RCs that
contain knowledge of the native state and those that are purely geometric in
nature. Our method for extracting diffusivity profiles is easily applied to
experimental single molecule time series data and might help to reconcile
conflicts that arise when comparing results from different experimental probes

understanding structure non-preserving algorithms and is especially useful in
deriving very high-order algorithms via {\it analytical} extrapolations. In

hydrogen line emission spectrum, with the 4.695um v=0-0 S(9) line dominating
the emission in the 4-5um wavelength range, and no detected continuum
component. Our data for G19.88-0.53 prove that green fuzzy emission can be due
primarily to emission lines of molecular hydrogen within the bandpass of the
IRAC 4.5um channel. However, the other target observed, G49.27-0.34, does not
exhibit any line emission and appears to be an embedded massive young stellar
object with a cometary UC HII region. We suggest that the effects of extinction
in the 3-8um wavelength range and an exaggeration in the color stretch of the
4.5um filter in IRAC RGB images could lead to embedded sources such as this one
falsely appearing ""green"".

may account for part of the deficits, but partial covering of the highest

matter in the general 19 parameter supergravity (SUGRA-19) model. A scan over
GUT scale parameters reveals that models with a bino-like neutralino typically
give rise to a dark matter density \Omega_{\tz_1}h^2\sim 1-1000, i.e. between 1
and 4 orders of magnitude higher than the measured value. Models with higgsino
or wino cold dark matter can yield the correct relic density, but mainly for
neutralino masses around 700-1300 GeV. Models with mixed bino-wino or
bino-higgsino CDM, or models with dominant co-annihilation or A-resonance
annihilation can yield the correct abundance, but such cases are extremely hard
to generate using a general scan over GUT scale parameters; this is indicative
of high fine-tuning of the relic abundance in these cases. Requiring that
m_{\tz_1}\alt 500 GeV (as a rough naturalness requirement) gives rise to a
minimal probably dip in parameter space at the measured CDM abundance. For
comparison, we also scan over mSUGRA space with four free parameters. Finally,
we investigate the Peccei-Quinn augmented MSSM with mixed axion/axino cold dark
matter. In this case, the relic abundance agrees more naturally with the
measured value. In light of our cumulative results, we conclude that future
axion searches should probe much more broadly in axion mass, and deeper into
the axion coupling.

strongest in the Fe xii and Fe xiii lines. Based on analyses using line ratios

temperature of log T = 6.2. The electron densities measured at different
locations in the moss regions using Fe xii ratios are about 1-3\times1010
cm(-3) and about 2-4\times10^9 cm^(-3) using Fe xiii and Fe xiv. The electron
density substantially increases (by a factor of about 3-4 or even more in some
cases) when a background subtraction was performed. The density and temperature
show very small variation over time. The filling factor of the moss plasma can
vary between 0.1-1 and the path length along which the emission originates is
from a few 100 to a few 1000 kms long. By combining the observations recorded

deep, high dispersion optical spectra, as well as mid-infrared (IR) spectra
from the Spitzer Space Telescope. A detailed comparison with prior SMC PN
studies shows that significant variations among authors of relative emission
line flux determinations lead to systematic discrepancies in derived elemental
abundances between studies that are >~0.15 dex, in spite of similar analysis
methods. We used ionic abundances derived from IR emission lines, including
those from ionization stages not observable in the optical, to examine the
accuracy of some commonly used recipes for ionization correction factors
(ICFs). These ICFs, which were developed for ions observed in the optical and
ultraviolet, relate ionic abundances to total elemental abundances. We find
that most of these ICFs work very well even in the limit of substantially
sub-Solar metallicities, except for PNe with very high ionization. Our
abundance analysis shows enhancements of He and N that are predicted from prior
dredge-up processes of the progenitors on the AGB, as well as the well known
correlations among O, Ne, S, and Ar that are little affected by nucleosynthesis
in this mass range. We identified MG_8 as an interesting limiting case of a PN
central star with a ~3.5 M_sun progenitor in which hot-bottom burning did not
occur in its prior AGB evolution. We find no evidence for O depletion in the
progenitor AGB stars via the O-N cycle, which is consistent with predictions
for lower-mass stars. We also find low S/O ratios relative to SMC H_II regions,
with a deficit comparable to what has been found for Galactic PNe.

formation of more complex N- and O-bearing molecules, such as CH3CN and
HCOOCH3. Despite a number of recent studies, little is known about their
abundances in the solid state. (...) In this work, we investigate the ~ 8-10
micron region in the Spitzer IRS (InfraRed Spectrograph) spectra of 41 low-mass
young stellar objects (YSOs). These data are part of a survey of interstellar
ices in a sample of low-mass YSOs studied in earlier papers in this series. We
used both an empirical and a local continuum method to correct for the
contribution from the 10 micron silicate absorption in the recorded spectra. In
addition, we conducted a systematic laboratory study of NH3- and
CH3OH-containing ices to help interpret the astronomical spectra. We clearly
detect a feature at ~9 micron in 24 low-mass YSOs. Within the uncertainty in
continuum determination, we identify this feature with the NH3 nu_2 umbrella
mode, and derive abundances with respect to water between ~2 and 15%.
Simultaneously, we also revisited the case of CH3OH ice by studying the nu_4
C-O stretch mode of this molecule at ~9.7 micron in 16 objects, yielding
abundances consistent with those derived by Boogert et al. 2008 (hereafter
paper I) based on a simultaneous 9.75 and 3.53 micron data analysis. Our study
indicates that NH3 is present primarily in H2O-rich ices, but that in some
cases, such ices are insufficient to explain the observed narrow FWHM. The
laboratory data point to CH3OH being in an almost pure methanol ice, or mixed
mainly with CO or CO2, consistent with its formation through hydrogenation on
grains. Finally, we use our derived NH3 abundances in combination with
previously published abundances of other solid N-bearing species to find that
up to 10-20 % of nitrogen is locked up in known ices.

equipped with a closed nondegenerate differential form of degree n+1. In our
previous work with Baez and Hoffnung, we described how the `higher analogs' of
the algebraic and geometric structures found in symplectic geometry should
naturally arise in 2-plectic geometry. In particular, we showed that just as a
symplectic manifold gives a Poisson algebra of functions, any 2-plectic

examples of L-infinity algebras: graded vector spaces which are equipped with a
collection of skew-symmetric multi-brackets that satisfy a generalized Jacobi

we explicitly construct a corresponding Lie n-algebra on a complex consisting
of differential forms whose multi-brackets are specified by the n-plectic

of algebraic structure known as a differential graded Leibniz algebra. We
conclude by describing the similarities between these two structures within the

non-compact Cartan subalgebra of the maximal subgroup SL(8,R) of E_7(7). In
absence of gauging, we utilize the explicit expression of the Lie algebra to
study the origin of E_7(7)/SU(8) as scalar configuration of a 1/8-BPS extremal
black hole attractor. In such a framework, we highlight the action of a U(1)
symmetry spanning the dyonic 1/8-BPS attractors. Within a suitable
supersymmetry truncation allowing for the embedding of the Reissner-Nordstrom
black hole, this U(1) is interpreted as nothing but the global R-symmetry of
pure N=2 supergravity. Moreover, we find that the above mentioned U(1) symmetry
is broken down to a discrete subgroup Z_4, implying that all 1/8-BPS Iwasawa
attractors are non-dyonic near the origin of the scalar manifold. We can trace
this phenomenon back to the fact that the Cartan subalgebra of SL(8,R) used in
our construction endows the symplectic frame with a manifest off-shell
covariance which is smaller than SL(8,R) itself. Thus, the consistence of the
Adams-Iwasawa symplectic basis with the action of the U(1) symmetry gives rise
to the observed Z_4 residual non-dyonic symmetry.

Hastings algorithms that are known to converge very slowly when applied to the

population growth models, most notably their multi-modal posterior surfaces and

cosmology (close to WMAP5), we quantify the breaking of universality in the
form of the mass function as a function of redshift, finding an evolution of as
much as 10% away from the universal form between redshifts $z=0$ and $z=2$. For
cosmologies very close to this reference we provide a fitting formula to our
results for the (evolving) $\Lambda$CDM mass function over a mass range of

2%. The set of $w$CDM cosmologies is taken from the Coyote Universe simulation

material. The mountain then relaxes further resistively after accretion ceases.
The BRMSP spin-down limit approaches the theoretical electron-impurity
resistivity at temperatures $\ga 10^5$ K for an impurity concentration of $\sim
0.1$, while the AMSP stalling limit falls two orders of magnitude below the

computational complexity of the number modulo 2 of a graph's edge set
decompositions of various kinds, first of all including its Hamiltonian
decompositions, as well as the number modulo 2 of, say, Hamiltonian
cycles/paths etc. While the problems of finding a Hamiltonian decomposition and
Hamiltonian cycle are NP-complete, counting these objects modulo 2 in
polynomial time is yet possible for certain types of regular undirected graphs.
Some of the most known examples are the theorems about the existence of an even
number of Hamiltonian decompositions in a 4-regular graph and an even number of
such decompositions where two given edges e and g belong to different cycles
(Thomason, 1978), as well as an even number of Hamiltonian cycles passing
through any given edge in a regular odd-degreed graph (Smith's theorem). The
present article introduces a new algebraic technique which generalizes the
notion of counting modulo 2 via applying fields of Characteristic 2 and
determinants and, for instance, allows to receive a polynomial-time formula for
the number modulo 2 of a 4-regular bipartite graph's Hamiltonian decompositions
such that a given edge and a given path of length 2 belong to different
Hamiltonian cycles - hence refining/extending (in a computational sense)
Thomason's result for bipartite graphs. This technique also provides a
polynomial-time calculation of the number modulo 2 of a graph's edge set
decompositions into simple cycles each containing at least one element of a
given set of its edges what is a similar kind of extension of Thomason's
theorem as well.

process in 2D Babcock-Leighton dynamo models, by modelling more accurately the
surface source term for poloidal field. Methods. To do so, we reintroduce in
mean-field models the results of full 3D MHD calculations of the non-linear
evolution of a rising flux tube in a convective shell. More specifically, the
Babcock-Leighton source term is modified to take into account the delay
introduced by the rise time of the toroidal structures from the base of the
convection zone to the solar surface. We find that the time delays introduced
in the equations produce large temporal modulation of the cycle amplitude even
when strong and thus rapidly rising flux tubes are considered. Aperiodic
modulations of the solar cycle appear after a sequence of period doubling
bifurcations typical of non-linear systems. The strong effects introduced even
by small delays is found to be due to the dependence of the delays on the
magnetic field strength at the base of the convection zone, the modulation
being much less when time delays remain constant. We do not find any
significant influence on the cycle period except when the delays are made
artificially strong. A possible new origin of the solar cycle variability is
here revealed. This modulated activity and the resulting butterfly diagram are
then more compatible with observations than what the standard Babcock-Leighton
model produces.

camera onboard ESA's Herschel Space Observatory, it is possible for the first
time to achieve a complete assessment of individual star-forming knots in the
FIR with scan maps at 70, 100, and 160 um. We used clump extraction photometry
and SED diagnostics to derive the properties related to star-forming activity.
The PACS 70, 100, and 160 um maps trace the knotty structure of the most recent
star formation along an arc between the two nuclei in the overlap area. The
resolution of the starburst knots and additional multi-wavelength data allow
their individual star formation history and state to be analysed. In
particular, the brightest knot in the mid-infrared (K1), east of the southern
nucleus, exhibits the highest activity by far in terms of dust heating and star
formation rate, efficiency, and density. With only 2 kpc in diameter, this area
has a 10-1000 um luminosity, which is as high as that of our Milky Way. It
shows the highest deficiency in radio emission in the radio-to-FIR luminosity
ratio and a lack of X-ray emission, classifying it as a very young complex. The
brightest 100 and 160 um emission region (K2), which is close to the collision
front and consists of 3 knots, also shows a high star formation density and
efficiency and lack of X-ray emission in its most obscured part, but an excess
in the radio-to-FIR luminosity ratio. This suggests a young stage, too, but
different conditions in its interstellar medium. Our results provide important
checkpoints for numerical simulations of interacting galaxies when modelling
the star formation and stellar feedback.

Rayleigh-Taylor instability are not anticipated. They are supported only by
hydrodynamic studies of stellar convection. We find that such mixing occurs
below the bottom edge of convection zones in our multidimensional hydrodynamic
shell convection models. It operates at interfaces created by off-center
nuclear burning, where less dense gas with higher mean molecular weight is
located above denser gas with a lower mean molecular weight. We discuss the
mixing under various conditions with hydrodynamic convection models based on
stellar evolutionary calculations of the core helium flash in a 1.25 Msun star,
the core carbon flash in a 9.3 Msun star, and of oxygen burning shell in a star
with a mass of 23 Msun. We simulate the hydrodynamic behavior of shell
convection during various phases of stellar evolution with the Eulerian
hydrodynamics code HERAKLES in two and three spatial dimensions. Initial models
for this purpose are obtained by state-of-the-art stellar evolutionary codes,
namely GARSTEC, STAREVOL, and TYCHO for the core helium flash, core carbon
flash, and oxygen shell burning, respectively. Most of our analysis is
performed for two-dimensional hydrodynamic models of shell convection during
the core helium flash at its peak covering approximately 250 convective
turnover timescales. The mixing manifests itself in the form of overdense and
cold fingers enriched with matter of higher mean molecular weight, originating
from density fluctuations at the lower boundary of the convective shell, and
""shooting"" down into the core. They result from the Rayleigh-Taylor instability
at the lower convection zone boundary due to a negative mean molecular weight
gradient. They do not appear when the mean molecular weight gradient is
positive.

in the Local Group spiral galaxy M33 to investigate the nature of the compact
SPIRE emission sources. We extracted a catalogue of sources at 250um in order
to investigate the nature of this compact emission. Taking advantage of the
unprecedented Herschel resolution at these wavelengths, we also focus on a more
precise study of some striking Halpha shells in the northern part of the
galaxy. We present a catalogue of 159 compact emission sources in M33
identified by SExtractor in the 250um SPIRE band that is the one that provides
the best spatial resolution. We also measured fluxes at 24um and Halpha for
those 159 extracted sources. The morphological study of the shells also
benefits from a multiwavelength approach including Halpha, far-UV from GALEX,
and infrared from both Spitzer IRAC 8um and MIPS 24um in order to make
comparisons. For the 159 compact sources selected at 250um, we find a very
strong Pearson correlation coefficient with the MIPS 24um emission (r24 = 0.94)
and a rather strong correlation with the Halpha emission, although with more
scatter (rHa = 0.83). The morphological study of the Halpha shells shows a
displacement between far-ultraviolet, Halpha, and the SPIRE bands. The cool
dust emission from SPIRE clearly delineates the Halpha shell structures. The
very strong link between the 250um compact emission and the 24um and Halpha
emissions, by recovering the star formation rate from standard recipes for HII
regions, allows us to provide star formation rate calibrations based on the
250um compact emission alone. The different locations of the Halpha and
far-ultraviolet emissions with respect to the SPIRE cool dust emission leads to
a dynamical age of a few Myr for the Halpha shells and the associated cool
dust.

the curvature perturbation not only depends on the particular process of decay
but is also dependent on the sound speed $c_s$ from the DBI action. More
interestingly we find that the non-Gaussianity parameter $f_{NL}$ is

such as the need for the nodes to manage autonomously and dynamically in order
to adapt to changes detected in the environment. To address the above issue, a
number of autonomic frameworks has been proposed. These usually offer either
predefined self-management policies or programmatic mechanisms for creating new
policies at design time. From a more theoretical perspective, some works
propose the adoption of prediction models as a way to anticipate the evolution
of the system and to make timely decisions. In this context, our aim is to
experiment with the integration of prediction models within a specific
autonomic framework in order to assess the feasibility of such integration in a
setting where the characteristics of dynamicity, decentralization, and
cooperation among nodes are important. We extend an existing infrastructure

charged pion pairs, and identified charged kaon pairs in Au+Au, d+Au, and p+p
collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider
using the STAR detector. These balance functions are presented in terms of
relative pseudorapidity, $\Delta \eta$, relative rapidity, $\Delta y$, relative
azimuthal angle, $\Delta \phi$, and invariant relative momentum, $q_{\rm inv}$.
In addition, balance functions are shown in terms of the three components of
$q_{\rm inv}$: $q_{\rm long}$, $q_{\rm out}$, and $q_{\rm side}$. For charged
particle pairs, the width of the balance function in terms of $\Delta \eta$
scales smoothly with the number of participating nucleons, while HIJING and
UrQMD model calculations show no dependence on centrality or system size. For
charged particle and charged pion pairs, the balance functions widths in terms
of $\Delta \eta$ and $\Delta y$ are narrower in central Au+Au collisions than
in peripheral collisions. The width for central collisions is consistent with
thermal blast-wave models where the balancing charges are highly correlated in
coordinate space at breakup. This strong correlation might be explained either
by delayed hadronization or by limited diffusion during the reaction.
Furthermore, the narrowing trend is consistent with the lower kinetic
temperatures inherent to more central collisions. In contrast, the width of the
balance function for charged kaon pairs in terms of $\Delta y$ shows little
centrality dependence, which may signal a different production mechanism for
kaons. The widths of the balance functions for charged pions and kaons in terms
of $q_{\rm inv}$ narrow in central collisions compared to peripheral
collisions, which may be driven by the change in the kinetic temperature.

information. Central to the idea of typicality is that a sequence $x_1, x_2,
..., x_n$ that is $P_X$-typical should, loosely speaking, have an empirical
distribution that is in some sense close to the distribution $P_X$. The two
most common notions of typicality are that of strong (letter) typicality and
weak (entropy) typicality. While weak typicality allows one to apply many
arguments that can be made with strongly typical arguments, some arguments for
strong typicality cannot be generalized to weak typicality. In this paper, we
consider an alternate definition of typicality, namely one based on the weak*
topology and that is applicable to Polish alphabets (which includes
$\reals^n$). This notion is a generalization of strong typicality in the sense
that it degenerates to strong typicality in the finite alphabet case, and can
also be applied to mixed and continuous distributions. Furthermore, it is
strong enough to prove a Markov lemma, and thus can be used to directly prove a
more general class of results than weak typicality. As an example of this
technique, we directly prove achievability for Gel'fand-Pinsker channels with
input constraints for a large class of alphabets and channels without first
proving a finite alphabet result and then resorting to delicate quantization
arguments. While this large class does not include Gaussian distributions with
power constraints, it is shown to be straightforward to recover this case by
considering a sequence of truncated Gaussian distributions.

Interestingly, the extra-planar dust lacks a warm temperature component when

dust stripping in clusters of galaxies and illustrates the potential of

with alternating polarities in gliding assays with non-processive myosin
motors. In the model, the bundle is represented as an elastic chain consisting
of monomers with positive and negative polarities. The motion of the bundle is
induced by the pulling forces of the underlying motors which stochastically
attach to the monomers and, depending on the polarity of the monomers, pull
them in the right or left direction. We demonstrate that perfectly a-polar
chains consisting of equal numbers of monomers with positive and negative
polarities may exhibit biased bidirectional motion with non-zero drift. This
effect is attributed to the elastic tension developed in the chain due to the
action of the myosin motors. We also show that as a result of this tension, the
attachment probability of the motors is greatly reduced and becomes strongly
dependent on the length of the chain. These surprising effects point to the
necessity of considering the elasticity of the cytoskeleton in theoretical
studies of cooperative dynamics of molecular motors.

equations of motion that, for generic boundary data, can have solutions with

Wheeler-Feynman electrodynamics has a boundary value variational method for

sets of points of zero measure where the advanced/retarded velocities and/or

the \emph{generalized absorber hypothesis} that the far fields vanish
asymptotically \emph{almost everywhere%} and show that localized orbits with
far fields vanishing almost everywhere \emph{must} have discontinuous
velocities on sewing chains of breaking points. We give the general solution
for localized orbits with vanishing far fields by solving a (linear) neutral
differential delay equation for these far fields. We discuss the physics of
orbits with discontinuous derivatives stressing the differences to the
variational methods of classical mechanics and the existence of a spinorial
four-current associated with the generalized variational electrodynamics.

differs from existing bunched logics in that its multiplicative connectives
behave classically rather than intuitionistically (including in particular a
multiplicative version of classical negation). At the semantic level,
CBI-formulas have the normal bunched logic reading as declarative statements
about resources, but its resource models necessarily feature more structure
than those for other bunched logics; principally, they satisfy the requirement
that every resource has a unique dual. At the proof-theoretic level, a very
natural formalism for CBI is provided by a display calculus \`a la Belnap,
which can be seen as a generalisation of the bunched sequent calculus for BI.
In this paper we formulate the aforementioned model theory and proof theory for
CBI, and prove some fundamental results about the logic, most notably
completeness of the proof theory with respect to the semantics.

This emission has a low-flux state where it is dominated by thermal emission

non-thermal component appears. The variations are now known to have a period of
6.7 +/- 0.2 yr. The non-thermal component has been attributed to different
agents: an expanding envelope ejected periodically from the binary, emission
from a wind-collision region, or a star with non-thermal emission in an
eccentric orbit around the binary. The determination of the angular size of the
non-thermal component is crucial to discriminate between these alternatives. We
present the analysis of VLA archive observations made at 8.46 GHz in 1994 (low
state) and 1996 (high state), that allow us to subtract the effect of the
persistent thermal emission and to estimate an angular size of 0.02 arcseconds

radio luminosity. Lx,nuc ranges from 10^{38} to 10^{42} erg/s, and the
Eddington ratio Lx,nuc/Ledd from 10^{-9} to 10^{-4}. Lx,nuc increases on
average with the galactic luminosity Lb and Mbh, with a wide variation by up to
4 orders of magnitude at any fixed Lb>6x10^9 Lb,sun or Mbh>10^7 Msun. This
large range should reflect a large variation of the mass accretion rate
\dotMbh. On the circumnuclear scale, \dotMbh at fixed Lb (or Mbh) could vary
due to differences in the fuel production rate from the stellar mass return
linked to the inner galactic structure; however, \dotMbh should vary with
cuspiness by a factor exceeding a few only in hot gas poor galaxies and for
large differences in the core radius. Lx,nuc does not depend on age, but less
luminous nuclei are found among galaxies with a younger stellar component.
Lx,nuc is detected both in gas poor and gas rich galaxies, on average increases
with the total galactic hot gas cooling rate L_{X,ISM}, but again with a large
variation. The lack of a tight relationship between Lx,nuc and the
circumnuclear and total gas content can be explained if the gas is heated by
black hole feedback, and/or the mass effectively accreted can be largely
reduced with respect to that entering the circumnuclear region. Differently
from Lx,nuc, the 5 GHz VLA luminosity shows a trend with the inner galactic
structure similar to that of the total soft X-ray emission; therefore they
could both be produced by the hot gas.

systematics, e.g., errors of antenna pointing directions, asynchronous between
the attitude and science data, can generate pseudo-dipole signal in full-sky
maps of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy published by The
Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) team. Now the antenna sidelobe
response to the Doppler signal is found to be able to produce similar effect as
well. In this work, independent to the sources, we uniformly model the
pseudo-dipole signal and remove it from published WMAP7 CMB maps by model
fitting. The result demonstrates that most of the released WMAP CMB quadrupole
is artificial.

used to study the stellar content of IRAS 19343+2026, a (proto)star/cluster
candidate, located close to the Galactic plane. The data suggest that IRAS
19343+2026 is a rich cluster associated with a massive protostar of 7.6 Msol
with an age of ~ 10^5 yr. Three point sources in the vicinity of the
far-infrared (FIR) peak are also found to be early B type stars. The remaining
(predominantly low mass) members of the cluster are best represented by a 1 - 3
Myr pre-main-sequence (PMS) population. HK band spectra of two bright and five
faint point sources in the cluster confirm that the results obtained from the
photometry are good representations of their young stellar object (YSO) nature.
Thus, IRAS 19343+2026 is a young cluster with at least four early B-type stars
classified as young (10^4 - 10^5 yr), that are surrounded by a somewhat older
(1 - 3 Myr) population of low mass YSOs. Together, these results argue for a
scenario in which low mass stars form prior to massive stars in a cluster
forming environment. We compute the Initial Mass Function (IMF) for this
cluster using the K-band luminosity function; the slope of the IMF is shallower
than predicted by the Salpeter's mass function. The cluster mass, Mtot, is
estimated to be in the range ~ 307 Msol (from the data completeness limit) -
585 Msol (extrapolated down to the brown dwarf limit, assuming a certain IMF).

must first specify a prior. We advocate the use of objective priors, and, in

for the Jeffreys' Prior for the case in which the observations are independent
and normally distributed. These expressions make the calculation of the prior
much simpler than evaluation directly from the definition. In this paper, we
now relax the independence assumption and derive expressions for the Jeffreys'
Prior for the case in which the observations are distributed with a
multivariate normal distribution with constant covariances. Again, these
expressions simplify the calculation of the prior: in this case they reduce it
to the calculation of the differences between the ensemble means of climate
model ensembles based on different parameter settings. These calculations are
simple enough to be applied to even the most complex climate models.

polydispersity in self-assembly, we put forward a coarse-grained model that
describes the spontaneous formation of quasi-linear polymers in solutions
containing two self-assembling species. Our theoretical framework is based on a
two-component self-assembled Ising model in which the bidispersity is
parameterized in terms of the strengths of the binding free energies that
depend on the monomer species involved in the pairing interaction. Depending
upon the relative values of the binding free energies involved, different
morphologies of assemblies that include both components are formed, exhibiting
paramagnetic-, ferromagnetic- or anti ferromagnetic-like order,i.e., random,
blocky or alternating ordering of the two components in the assemblies.
Analyzing the model for the case of ferromagnetic ordering, which is of most
practical interest, we find that the transition from conditions of minimal
assembly to those characterized by strong polymerization can be described by a
critical concentration that depends on the concentration ratio of the two
species. Interestingly, the distribution of monomers in the assemblies is
different from that in the original distribution, i.e., the ratio of the
concentrations of the two components put into the system. The monomers with a
smaller binding free energy are more abundant in short assemblies and monomers
with a larger binding affinity are more abundant in longer assemblies. Under
certain conditions the two components congregate into separate supramolecular
polymeric species and in that sense phase separate. We find strong deviations
from the expected growth law for supramolecular polymers even for modest
amounts of a second component, provided it is chemically sufficiently distinct
from the main one.

impurity (C centre) is identified and the assignments of the rest of the
nitrogen-related bands are still debated. It is speculated that the
unidentified bands in the Nitrogen absorption region are not induced by
Nitrogen but rather by Nitrogen-hydrides because in the interstellar
environment Nitrogen reacts with Hydrogen and forms NH+; NH; NH2; NH3. Among
these Hydrides the electronic configuration of NH+ is the closest to Carbon.
Thus this ionized Nitrogen-mono-hydride is the best candidate to substitute
Carbon in the diamond structure. The bands of the substitutional NH+ defect are
deduced by red shifting the irradiation induced N+ bands due to the mass of the
additional Hydrogen. The six bands of the NH+ defects are identified in both
the pre-solar and the carbonado diamond spectra. The new assignments identify
all of the nitrogen-related bands in the spectra, indicating that pre-solar and
carbonado diamonds contain only single nitrogen impurities.

this peculiar stellar system. The LTE values of [Mn/Fe] in Omega Cen overlap
those of Milky Way stars in the metal poor Omega Cen populations ([Fe/H] ~ -1.5

the conclusion that the manganese behavior in Omega Cen is distinct. These
results suggest that low-metallicity supernovae (with metallicities < -2) of
either Type II or Type Ia dominated the enrichment of the more metal-rich stars
in Omega Cen. The dominance of low-metallicity stars in the chemical evolution

enrichment from metal-poor AGB stars is indicated. In addition, copper, which

hypothesis that the burst signal is ""locally stationary"", that is it changes
slowly with frequency. Under this assumption, the signal can be decomposed into
a small number of wavelets with constant frequency. This justifies the use of a
family of sine-Gaussian templates in the Omega pipeline, one of the algorithms
used in LIGO-Virgo burst searches. However there are plausible scenarios where
the burst frequency evolves rapidly, such as in the merger phase of a binary
black hole and/or neutron star coalescence. In those cases, the local
stationarity of sine-Gaussians induces performance losses, due to the mismatch
between the template and the actual signal. We propose an extension of the
Omega pipeline based on chirplet-like templates. Chirplets incorporate an
additional parameter, the chirp rate, to control the frequency variation. In
this paper, we show that the Omega pipeline can easily be extended to include a
chirplet template bank. We illustrate the method on a simulated data set, with
a family of phenomenological binary black-hole coalescence waveforms embedded
into Gaussian LIGO/Virgo-like noise. Chirplet-like templates result in an
enhancement of the measured signal-to-noise ratio.
