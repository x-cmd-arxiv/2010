of radiation emission from stacked Josephson junctions, and employ them for
analysis of flux-flow emission from intrinsic Josephson junctions in high-$T_c$
superconductors. It is shown that due to the lack of Lorenz contraction of
fluxons in stacked junctions, high quality geometrical resonances are
prerequisite for high power emission from the stack. This leads to a dual role
of the radiative impedance: on the one hand, small impedance increases the
efficiency of emission from the stack, on the other hand, enhanced radiative
losses reduce the quality factor of geometrical resonances, which may decrease
the total emission power. Therefore, the optimal conditions for the coherent
flux-flow oscillator are achieved when radiative losses are comparable to
resistive losses inside the stack.

strong constraints on the slope of the underlying gravitational potential and
provides a new test on modified gravities. Here we investigate whether the
interpretation that the stellar clump in Ursa Minor (UMi) dwarf spheroidal
galaxy is a `dynamical fossil' is consistent with Modified Newtonian dynamics
(MOND). For UMi mass models inferred by fitting the velocity dispersion
profile, the stellar clump around the second peak of UMi is erased very
rapidly, within 1.25 Gyr (6.5 orbits), even with the inclusion of self-gravity.
We find that the clump can hardly survive for more than 2 Gyr even under more
generous conditions. Alternative scenarios which could lead to a kinematically
cold clump are discussed but, so far, none of them were found to be fully
satisfactory. Our conclusion is that the cold clump in UMi poses a challenge
for both LambdaCDM and MOND.

introduce a new way to apply Lyapunov stability theory, using the Lyapunov

increases toward the lower atmosphere. Two other BHB stars (B334 in M15 and

dependence of the slope of iron stratification on the effective temperature was
also discovered. It is found that the vertical stratification of iron is
strongest in BHB stars with Teff around 11,500K. The slope of iron abundance
decreases as Teff increases and becomes negligible for the BHB stars with Teff=
14,000K. These results support the hypothesis regarding the efficiency of

techniques based on a ""post-epicyclic"" approximation in the Hill frame to find
optimal unperturbed orbits. The natural step forward is to analyze the
perturbations to purely Keplerian orbits. In the present work a particular

corrections to the Solar field responsible for a slow precession and a global
stationary field, associated to sources like the interplanetary dust or a local

  document",,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Qubits, the quantum mechanical bits required for quantum computing, must
retain their fragile quantum states over long periods of time. In many types of
electron spin qubits, the primary source of decoherence is the interaction
between the electron spins and nuclear spins of the host lattice. For electrons
in gate defined GaAs quantum dots, previous spin echo measurements have
revealed coherence times of about 1 $\mu$s at low magnetic fields below 100 mT.
Here, we show that coherence in such devices can actually survive to much
longer times, and provide a detailed understanding of the measured nuclear spin
induced decoherence. At fields above a few hundred millitesla, the coherence
time measured using a single-pulse spin echo extends to 30 $\mu$s. At lower
magnetic fields, the echo first collapses, but then revives at later times
given by the period of the relative Larmor precession of different nuclear
species. This behavior was recently predicted, and as we show can be
quantitatively accounted for by a semi-classical model for the electron spin
dynamics in the presence of a nuclear spin bath. Using a multiple-pulse
Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill echo sequence, the decoherence time can be extended
to more than 200 $\mu$s, which represents an improvement by two orders of
magnitude compared to previous measurements. This demonstration of effective
methods to mitigate nuclear spin induced decoherence puts the quantum error
correction threshold within reach.

noncommutative case, we find that the noncommutative character of the manifold
would be equivalent to the temperature of a thermodynamic system. Therefore, in
analogy to the zero temperature configuration, the description of spacetime in
terms of a differential manifold could be obtained only asymptotically.
Finally, we extend the Verlinde's derivation to a general case, which includes
all possible effects, noncommutativity, ungravity, asymptotically safe gravity,
electrostatic energy, and extra dimensions, showing that the procedure is solid

Herculis. Doppler tomography of two He I lines reveals a spiral density
structure in the accretion disc around the white dwarf primary. The spirals
look very similar to the spirals seen in dwarf novae during outburst. DQ Her is
the first well established intermediate polar in which spirals are seen, that
are in addition likely persistent because of the system's high mass transfer
rate. Spiral structures give an alternative explanation for sidebands of the WD
spin frequency that are found in IP light curves. The Doppler tomogram of He II
4686 indicates that a large part of the emission is not disc-like. Spin trails
of spectra reveal a pulsation in the He II 4686 emission that is believed to
result from reprocessing of X-rays from the white dwarf's magnetic poles in the
accretion flow close to the WD. We confirm the previous finding that the
pulsation is only visible in the red-shifted part of the line when the beam
points to the back side of the disc. The absence of reprocessed light from the
front side of the disc can be explained by obscuration by the front rim of the
disc, but the absence of extra emission from the blue-shifted back side of the
disc is puzzling. Reprocessing in accretion curtains can be an answer to the
problem and can also explain the highly non-Keplerian velocity components that
are found in the He II 4686 line. Our spin trails can form a strong test for
future accretion curtain models, with the possibility of distinguishing between
a spin period of 71s or 142s. Spin trails of data taken at selected orbital
phases show little evidence for a significant contribution of the bright spot
to the pulsations and allow us to exclude a recent suggestion that 71s is the
beat period and 70.8s the spin period.

find such modes and determine their dispersion relation, they turn out to be of
two different types, according to their spatial behavior. There are
non-periodic in space negative modes, which can contribute to the instability
of infinitely long vortices, but they can be eliminated by imposing the
periodic boundary conditions along the vortex. There are also periodic negative
modes, but their wavelength is always larger than a certain minimal value, so
that they cannot be accommodated by the short vortex segments. However, even
for the latter there remains one negative mode responsible for the homogeneous

show a heterogeneous distribution of morphologies while the ma jority tend to
be highly concentrated and compact in size. We only measure the morphological
properties of resolved LAEs. For systems showing multiple components we also
measured the morphology of the individual components. The resolved LAEs are
highly concentrated (2 < C < 4) and show a similar distribution to that
measured for stars, suggesting that this diagnostic is a poor discriminator
near the resolution limit. The measured ellipticities for components show a
distribution peaked at {\epsilon} ~ 0.55 which is significantly different from
the flat distribution of ellipticities observed for local spiral galaxies and
is similar to the distribution found for Lyman-break galaxies at the same
redshift. There is a wide range of best-fit Sersic indices (1 < n < 10) with
the majority being between 0 < n < 2. The distribution is similar to the
distribution of Sersic indices seen locally. A visual inspection of the images
suggests a qualitative morphological transition at n ~ 2, with small-n LAEs
having extended or multimodal light distributions and relatively little diffuse
emission and large-n LAEs have compact central components surrounded by diffuse
emission.

between cluster members may significantly affect the evolution of circumstellar
discs and therefore the formation of planets and brown dwarfs. Recent findings
suggest that tidal perturbations of typical circumstellar discs due to close
encounters may inhibit rather than trigger disc fragmentation and so would seem
to rule out planet formation by external tidal stimuli. However, the disc
models in these calculations were restricted to disc radii of 40 AU and disc
masses below 0.1 M_sun. Here we show that even modest encounters can trigger
fragmentation around 100 AU in the sorts of massive (~0.5 M_sun), extended
(>=100 AU) discs that are observed around young stars. Tidal perturbation alone
can do this, no disc-disc collision is required. We also show that
very-low-mass binary systems can form through the interaction of objects in the
disc. In our computations, otherwise non-fragmenting massive discs, once
perturbed, fragment into several objects between about 0.01 and 0.1 M_sun,
i.e., over the whole brown dwarf mass range. Typically these orbit on highly
eccentric orbits or are even ejected. While probably not suitable for the
formation of Jupiter- or Neptune-type planets, our scenario provides a possible
formation mechanism for brown dwarfs and very massive planets which,
interestingly, leads to a mass distribution consistent with the canonical
substellar IMF. As a minor outcome, a possible explanation for the origin of
misaligned extrasolar planetary systems is discussed.

far-infrared/sub-mm sources that are associated with stars or star-like objects
on the SDSS main-sequence locus. We validate our approach by comparing the
properties of the most likely candidate disks to those of the known population.
Methods: We use a photometric selection technique to identify main sequence
stars in the SDSS DR7 catalogue and a Bayesian Likelihood Ratio method to
identify H-ATLAS catalogue sources associated with these main sequence stars.
Following this photometric selection we apply distance cuts to identify the
most likely candidate debris disks and rule out the presence of contaminating

sources associated with SDSS point sources on the main-sequence locus, of which
two are the most likely debris disk candidates: H-ATLAS J090315.8 and H-ATLAS

properties to the known population of debris disks. Our initial results
indicate that bright debris disks are rare, with only 2 candidates identified

shed light on the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation at high-z via observed SFR-CO

utilising these observations of high-excitation CO to derive the underlying
Schmidt (SFR-rho^N) relationship. To do this requires an understanding of the
potential effects of differential CO excitation with SFR. If the most heavily
star-forming galaxies have a larger fraction of their gas in highly excited CO
states than the lower SFR galaxies, then the observed molecular SFR-CO^alpha
index, alpha, will be less than the underlying (volumetric) Schmidt index, N.
Utilising a combination of SPH models of galaxy evolution and molecular line
radiative transfer, we present the first calculations of CO excitation in z~2
disc galaxies with the aim of developing a mapping between various observed
SFR-CO relationships and the underlying Schmidt relation. We find that even in
relatively luminous z~2 discs, differential excitation does indeed exist,
resulting in alpha < N for highly excited CO lines. This means that an observed
(e.g.) SFR-CO (J=3-2) relation does not map linearly to SFR-H2 relation. We
utilise our model results to provide a mapping from alpha to N for the range of
Schmidt indices N=1-2. By comparing to recent observational surveys, we find
that the observed SFR-CO (J=2-1) and SFR-CO (J=3-2) relations suggest that an
underlying SFR rho^1.5 relation describes z~2 disc galaxies.

events with an extended lens and/or source. We consider not only a dark lens
but also a luminous lens as well. We find that the discontinuous finite-lens
trajectories given by Takahashi (2003) will become continuous in the
finite-source regime. The point lens (source) approximation alone gives an
under (over)estimation of the astrometric signal when the size of the lens and
source are not negligible. While the finiteness of the source is revealed when
the lens transits the surface of the source, the finite-lens signal is most
prominent when the lens is very close to the source. Astrometric microlensing
towards the Galactic bulge, Small Magellanic Cloud and M31 are discussed, which
indicate that the finite-lens effect is beyond the detection limit of current
instruments. Nevertheless, it is possible to distinguish between self-lensing
and halo lensing through a (non-)detection of the astrometric ellipse. We also
consider the case where the lens is luminous itself, as has been observed where
a lensing event was followed up with the Hubble Space Telescope. We show that
the astrometric signal will be reduced in a luminous-lens scenario. The
physical properties of the event, such as the lens-source flux ratio, the size
of the lens and source nevertheless can be derived by fitting the astrometric

large-scale structure in and around clusters causes correlated signals in

multi-physics probes of clusters. We pay particular attention to velocity
dispersions, matching galaxies to subhalos which are explicitly tracked in the
simulation. We find that not only do halos persist as subhalos when they fall
into a larger host, groups of subhalos retain their identity for long periods
within larger host halos. The highly anisotropic nature of infall into massive
clusters, and their triaxiality, translates into an anisotropic velocity
ellipsoid: line-of-sight galaxy velocity dispersions for any individual halo
show large variance depending on viewing angle. The orientation of the velocity
ellipsoid is correlated with the large-scale structure, and thus velocity
outliers correlate with outliers caused by projection in other probes. We
quantify this orientation uncertainty and give illustrative examples. Such a
large variance suggests that velocity dispersion estimators will work better in
an ensemble sense than for any individual cluster, which may inform strategies
for obtaining redshifts of cluster members. We similarly find that the ability
of substructure indicators to find kinematic substructures is highly viewing
angle dependent. While groups of subhalos which merge with a larger host halo
can retain their identity for many Gyr, they are only sporadically picked up by
substructure indicators. (Abridged)

the above xi(r) models, we find that the combined VLT and Keck surveys require
a galaxy velocity dispersion, <w_z^2>^1/2 ~ 700 km/s, higher than the ~400 km/s
found by previous authors. We also measure a value for the gravitational growth
rate parameter of beta(z=3) = 0.48+-0.17, implying a low value for the bias of
b = 2.06+1.1-0.5. This value is consistent with the galaxy clustering amplitude
which gives b = 2.22+-0.16, assuming the standard cosmology, implying that the
evolution of the gravitational growth rate is also consistent with Einstein
gravity. We have compared our LBG clustering amplitudes with lower redshift

that of low-redshift L* spirals for simple 'long-lived' galaxy models.

Hamiltonians with minimum eigenvalue gap G. The eigenpath traversal problem is
to transform one or more copies of the initial to the final eigenstate.
Solutions to this problem have applications ranging from quantum physics
simulation to optimization. For Hamiltonians, the conventional way of doing
this is by applying the adiabatic theorem. We give ``digital'' methods for
performing the transformation that require no assumption on path continuity or
differentiability other than the absence of large jumps. Given sufficient
information about eigenvalues and overlaps between states on the path, the
transformation can be accomplished with complexity O(L/G log(L/e)), where L is
the angular length of the path and e is a specified bound on the error of the
output state. We show that the required information can be obtained in a first
set of transformations, whose complexity per state transformed has an
additional factor that depends logarithmically on a maximum angular velocity
along the path. This velocity is averaged over constant angular distances and
does not require continuity. Our methods have substantially better behavior
than conventional adiabatic algorithms, with fewer conditions on the path. They
also improve on the previously best digital methods and demonstrate that path
length and the gap are the primary parameters that determine the complexity of
state transformation along a path.

cold mode, from streams with temperatures T~10^4-10^5 K. At these temperatures,
the streams should radiate primarily in the Lya line and have therefore been
proposed as a model to power the extended, high-redshift objects known as Lya
blobs and other high-redshift Lya sources. We introduce a new Lya radiative
transfer code, aRT, and apply it to cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. We
address physical and numerical issues that are critical to making accurate
predictions for the cooling luminosity, but that have been mostly neglected or
treated simplistically so far. We highlight the importance of self-shielding
and of properly treating sub-resolution models in simulations. Most existing
simulations do not self-consistently incorporate these effects, which can lead
to order-of-magnitude errors in the predicted cooling luminosity. Using a
combination of post-processing ionizing radiative transfer and re-simulation
techniques, we develop an approximation to the consistent evolution of the
self-shielded gas. We quantify the dependence of the Lya cooling luminosity on
halo mass at z=3 for the simplified problem of pure gas accretion. While

and AGN) is in principle sufficient to produce L_alpha~10^43-10^44 erg s^-1
blobs, this requires including energy released in gas of density sufficient to
form stars, but which is kept 100% gaseous in our optimistic estimates.
Excluding emission from such dense gas yields lower luminosities by up to one
to two orders of magnitude at high masses, making it difficult to explain the
observed Lya blobs with pure cooling. Resonant scattering produces diffuse Lya
halos, even for centrally concentrated emission, and broad double peaked line
profiles. [Abridged]

have been analysed and lead to more accurate abundances. It may be expected
that these better abundances lead to a better understanding of the evolution of
these objects. Aims: The observed abundances in planetary nebulae are compared
to those predicted by the models of Karakas (2003) in order to predict the
progenitor masses of the various PNe used. The morphology of the PNe is
included in the comparison. Since the central stars play an important role in
the evolution, it is expected that this comparison will yield additional
information about them. Methods: First the nitrogen/oxygen ratio is discussed
with relation to the helium/hydrogen ratio. The progenitor mass for each PNe
can be found by a comparison with the models of Karakas. Then the present
luminosity of the central stars is determined in two ways: first by computing
the central star effective temperature and radius, and second by computing the
nebular luminosity from the hydrogen and helium lines. This luminosity is also
a function of the initial mass so that these two values of initial mass can be
compared. Results: Six of the seven bipolar nebulae can be identified as
descendants of high mass stars (4Msun - 6Msun) while the seventh is ambiguous.
Most of the elliptical PNe have central stars which descend from low initial
mass stars, although there are a few caveats which are discussed. There is no
observational evidence for a higher mass for central stars which have a high
carbon/oxygen ratio. The evidence provided by the abundance comparison with the
models of Karakas is consistent with the HR diagram to which it is compared. In
the course of this discussion it is shown how `optically thin' nebulae can be
separated from those which are 'optically thick'.

a new proof of Nash's theorem, and the first part is a note explaining a

their careful study which led to their simultaneous discovery of this error. So
far the error has not been fixed, but many of the results and techniques of the
paper remain valid, so we will continue to make it available online.
  Abstract for the original paper:
  We give a novel proof of the existence of Nash equilibria in all finite games
without using fixed point theorems or path following arguments. Our approach
relies on a new notion intermediate between Nash and correlated equilibria
called exchangeable equilibria, which are correlated equilibria with certain
symmetry and factorization properties. We prove these exist by a duality
argument, using Hart and Schmeidler's proof of correlated equilibrium existence
as a first step.
  In an appropriate limit exchangeable equilibria converge to the convex hull
of Nash equilibria, proving that these exist as well. Exchangeable equilibria
are defined in terms of symmetries of the game, so this method automatically
proves the stronger statement that a symmetric game has a symmetric Nash
equilibrium. The case without symmetries follows by a symmetrization argument.

open cluster in the Orion Nebula Region, using near-IR and BV (RI)C photometric
data.We devised a method that accounts for the field contamination and allows
to derive photometric membership for the cluster stars. A new cluster centre
was determined by Gaussian fittings to the 2-D stellar distribution on the sky,
and has been used used to obtain the radial stellar density profile and the
structural parameters. Mass functions were computed for stars inside the
cluster limiting radius and total mass estimated from them. Although more
easily distinguished by its grouping of 6 relatively bright stars, an
underlying population of faint pre-main sequence stars is evident in the
cluster area. We showed that this population is related to the cluster itself
rather than to the nearby Orion Nebula cluster. Additionally a fraction of the
cluster low mass stars may have been evaporated from the region in its early
evolution leading to the present sparse, loose structure. The estimated

remains a matter of debate. Some studies find evidence of a far-infrared excess
due to thermal dust emission, whereas others propose that the far-infrared
emission can be explained by synchrotron emission without the need for an
additional dust emission component. We present Herschel PACS and SPIRE
observations of M87, taken as part of the science demonstration phase
observations of the Herschel Virgo Cluster Survey. We compare these data with a
synchrotron model based on mid-infrared, far-infrared, submm and radio data
from the literature to investigate the origin of the far-infrared emission.
Both the integrated SED and the Herschel surface brightness maps are adequately
explained by synchrotron emission. At odds with previous claims, we find no
evidence of a diffuse dust component in M87, which is not unexpected in the
harsh X-ray environment of this radio galaxy sitting at the core of the Virgo
Cluster.

can make repeated noisy observations of a binary hypothesis on the state of the
environment. At any time, any of the two observers can stop and send a final
message to the other observer or it may continue to take more measurements.
After an observer has sent its final message, it stops operating. The other
observer is then faced with a different stopping problem. At each time instant,
it can decide either to stop and declare a final decision on the hypothesis or
take another measurement. At each time, the system incurs an operating cost
depending on the number of observers that are active at that time. A terminal
cost that measures the accuracy of the final decision is incurred at the end.
We show that, unlike in other sequential detection problems, stopping rules
characterized by two thresholds on an observer's posterior belief no longer
guarantee optimality in this problem. Thus the potential for signaling among
observers alters the nature of optimal policies. We obtain a new parametric
characterization of optimal policies for this problem.

at moderately low temperatures the capacitance of the metal/ionic liquid
interface is so large that the effective thickness of the electrostatic
double-layer is up to 3 times smaller than the ion radius. To interpret these
results we suggest an approach which is based on the interaction between
discrete ions and their image charges in the metal surface and which therefore
goes beyond the mean-field approximation. When a voltage is applied across the
interface, the strong image attraction causes counterions to condense onto the
metal surface to form compact ion-image dipoles. These dipoles repel each other
to form a correlated liquid. When the surface density of these dipoles is low,
the insertion of an additional dipole does not require much energy. This leads
to a large capacitance $C$ that decreases monotonically with voltage $V$,
producing a ""bell-shaped"" curve $C(V)$. We also consider what happens when the
electrode is made from a semi-metal rather than a perfect metal. In this case,
the finite screening radius of the electrode shifts the reflection plane for
image charges to the interior of the electrode and we arrive at a
""camel-shaped"" $C(V)$. These predictions seem to be in qualitative agreement
with experiment.

state transitions, both from the hard to the soft spectral state and vice

the soft state above a threshold X-ray luminosity of about 10% of the Eddington

relatively diffuse, and consistent with steady jets rather than arising from
discrete, compact knots. In all cases where multi-frequency data were

we investigate the relationship between the dust emissivity index {\beta} and
the dust temperature, T_dust. Methods: Using Herschel PACS and SPIRE images at

Sh2-104, fitting the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) obtained from
aperture photometry. With the SPIRE Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) we
obtained spectra at different positions in the Sh2-104 region. We detect
J-ladders of CO and 13CO, with which we derive the gas temperature and column
density. We also detect proxies of ionizing flux as the [NII] 3P1-3P0 and [CI]
3P2-3P1 transitions. Results: We find an average value of {\beta} ~ 1.5

photodissociation region (PDR, ~ 25 K) and the interior (~ 40 K) of the bubble.
We recover the anti-correlation between {\beta} and dust temperature reported
numerous times in the literature. The relative isotopologue abundances of CO
appear to be enhanced above the standard ISM values, but the obtained value is
very preliminary and is still affected by large uncertainties.

GOODS-South galaxies that previously only had photometric redshifts now have
new grism-spectroscopic redshifts, in some cases with large corrections to the

in our sample has a magnitude m(AB)=26.9 mag. The ERS grism data also reflect
the expected trend of lower specific star formation rates for the highest mass

remarkable efficiency and capability of the WFC3 NIR grisms for measuring

depths of an ocean making those networks three-dimensional (3D). While most
terrestrial sensor networks can usually be modeled as two dimensional (2D)
networks, these underwater sensor networks must be modeled as 3D networks. This
leads to new research challenges in the area of network architecture and
topology. In this paper, we present two different network architectures for 3D
underwater sensor networks. The first one is a hierarchical architecture that
uses a relatively small number of robust backbone nodes to create the network
where a large number of inexpensive sensors communicate with their nearest
backbone nodes, and packets from a backbone node to the sink is routed through
other backbone nodes. This hierarchical approach allows creating a network of
smaller number of expensive backbone nodes while keeping the mobile sensors
simple and inexpensive. Along with network topology, we also study energy
efficiency and frequency reuse issues for such 3D networks. The second approach
is a nonhierarchical architecture which assumes that all nodes are identical
and randomly deployed. It partitions the whole 3D network space into identical
cells and keeps one node active in each cell such that sensing coverage and
connectivity are maintained while limiting the energy consumed. We also study
closeness to optimality of our proposed scheme.

major factor limiting our ability to extract faint compact sources is cirrus
confusion noise, operationally defined as the ""statistical error to be expected

surface brightness"". The histogram of the flux densities of extracted sources
shows a distinctive faint-end cutoff below which the catalog suffers from
incompleteness and the flux densities become unreliable. This empirical cutoff
should be closely related to the estimated cirrus noise and we show that this
is the case. We compute the cirrus noise directly, both on Herschel images from
which the bright sources have been removed and on simulated images of cirrus
with statistically similar fluctuations. We connect these direct estimates with
those from power spectrum analysis, which has been used extensively to predict
the cirrus noise and provides insight into how it depends on various
statistical properties and photometric operational parameters. We report
multi-wavelength power spectra of diffuse Galactic dust emission from Hi-GAL
observations at 70 to 500 microns within Galactic plane fields at l= 30 degrees
and l= 59 degrees. We find that the exponent of the power spectrum is about -3.
At 250 microns, the amplitude of the power spectrum increases roughly as the
square of the median brightness of the map and so the expected cirrus noise
scales linearly with the median brightness. Generally, the confusion noise will
be a worse problem at longer wavelengths, because of the combination of lower
angular resolution and the rising power spectrum of cirrus toward lower spatial
frequencies, but the photometric signal to noise will also depend on the
relative spectral energy distribution of the source compared to the cirrus.

The ACA is planning to compensate the atmospheric phase fluctuations using the

correction schemes using phase screens are tested with the SMA to study how
effective these schemes are. We produce a plane of a wavefront (phase screen)

phase screen is used for the interpolation and extrapolation of the phases of

apparently improved results, suggesting that the ACA phase correction scheme
will work well. On the other hand, the extrapolation scheme often does not
improve the results. After the extrapolation, unexpectedly large phase
fluctuations show up to the antennas at the distance of ~140 m away from the
center of the three reference antennas. These direction vectors are almost
perpendicular to the wind direction, suggesting that the phase fluctuations can
be well explained by the frozen phase screen.

parameters, in which the Phillips relation is adopted. However, the origin of
the relation is still unclear. Several parameters are suggested, e.g. the
relative content of carbon to oxygen (C/O) and the central density of the white
dwarf (WD) at ignition. These parameters are mainly determined by the WD's
initial mass and its cooling time, respectively. Using the progenitor model
developed by Meng and Yang, we present the distributions of the initial WD mass
and the cooling time. We do not find any correlation between these parameters.
However, we notice that the range of the WD's mass decreases, while its average
value increases with the cooling time. These results could provide a constraint
when simulating the SN Ia explosion, i.e. the WDs with a high C/O ratio usually
have a lower central density at ignition, while those having the highest
central density at ignition generally have a lower C/O ratio. The cooling time
is mainly determined by the evolutionary age of secondaries, and the scatter of
the cooling time decreases with the evolutionary age. Our results may indicate
that WDs with a long cooling time have more uniform properties than those with
a short cooling time, which may be helpful to explain why SNe Ia in elliptical
galaxies have a more uniform maximum luminosity than those in spiral galaxies.

function also gives all the values of the Borel regulator map and the complex
volumes of the parabolic representations. Furthermore, we explain the maximum

It is possible to dope some of the parent compounds with electrons, and their
physical properties are bearing some similarities but also significant
differences from the hole doped counterparts. Here, we use a recently developed
first principles method, to study the electron doped cuprates and elucidate the
deep physical reasons why their behavior is so different than the hole doped
materials. We find that electron doped compounds are Slater insulators, e.g. a
material where the insulating behavior is the result of the presence of
magnetic long range order. This is in sharp contrast with the hole doped
materials, where the parent compound is a Mott charge transfer insulator,
namely a material which is insulating due to the strong electronic correlations
but not due to the magnetic order.

simple algorithm to approximate the solution to a set of linear equations
defined by a Laplacian (for a graph $G$ with $n$ nodes and $m \le n^2$ edges)

runs in $O(n^2 \cdot \polylog(n))$ time rather than $O(m \cdot polylog(n))$

extremely simple; and it can be used to compute an approximate solution with a

connection between the concept of graph resistance (which has proven useful in
recent algorithms for linear equation solvers) and the concept of statistical

sequences, beginning with a donor star filling its Roche lobe at an arbitrary

fixed as mass is removed from the surface. The stellar interior remains in
hydrostatic equilibrium. Luminosity profiles in these adiabatic models of
mass-losing stars can be reconstructed from the specific entropy profiles and
their gradients. These approximations are validated by comparison with
time-dependent binary mass transfer calculations. We describe how adiabatic
mass loss sequences can be used to quantify threshold conditions for dynamical
time scale mass transfer, and to establish the range of post-common envelope

delays between quasar images, and the positions of faint central images. The
predicted large total magnification of \mu ~ 70 suggests that the lens system
is indeed a useful site for studying the fine structure of a distant quasar and
its host galaxy. The dark halo component is found to be unimodal centered on
the brightest cluster galaxy and the Chandra X-ray surface brightness profile.
In addition, the orientation of the halo component is quite consistent with
those of the brightest cluster galaxy and member galaxy distribution, implying
that the lensing cluster is a relaxed system. The radial profile of the
best-fit mass model is in good agreement with a mass profile inferred from the
X-ray observation. While the inner radial slope of the dark halo component is
consistent with being -1, a clear dependence of the predicted A-D time delay on

regions, taken during the science demonstration phase of Herschel discovered
fascinating, omnipresent filamentary structures that appear to be physically
related to compact cores. We briefly describe a new multi-scale,
multi-wavelength source extraction method used to detect objects and measure
their parameters in our Herschel images. All of the extracted starless cores
(541 in Aquila and 302 in Polaris) appear to form in the long and very narrow
filaments. With its combination of the far-IR resolution and sensitivity,
Herschel directly reveals the filaments in which the dense cores are embedded;
the filaments are resolved and have deconvolved widths of 35 arcsec in Aquila
and 59 arcsec in Polaris (9000 AU in both regions). Our first results of
observations with Herschel enable us to suggest that in general dense cores may
originate in a process of fragmentation of complex networks of long, thin
filaments, likely formed as a result of an interplay between gravity,
interstellar turbulence, and magnetic fields. To unravel the roles of the
processes, one has to obtain additional kinematic and polarization information;
these follow-up observations are planned.

molecular cloud, providing an unprecedented view of its star formation
activity. These new far-infrared data reveal a population of compact young
stellar objects whose physical properties we aim to characterise. We compiled a
sample of protostars and their spectral energy distributions that covers the
near-infrared to submillimetre wavelength range. These were used to constrain
key properties in the protostellar evolution, bolometric luminosity, and
envelope mass and to build an evolutionary diagram. Several clusters are
distinguished including the cloud centre, the embedded clusters in the vicinity
of luminous infrared sources, and the interaction region. The analysed
protostellar population in Rosette ranges from 0.1 to about 15 Msun with
luminosities between 1 and 150 Lsun, which extends the evolutionary diagram
from low-mass protostars into the high-mass regime. Some sources lack
counterparts at near- to mid-infrared wavelengths, indicating extreme youth.
The central cluster and the Phelps & Lada 7 cluster appear less evolved than
the remainder of the analysed protostellar population. For the central cluster,
we find indications that about 25% of the protostars classified as Class I from
near- to mid-infrared data are actually candidate Class 0 objects. As a
showcase for protostellar evolution, we analysed four protostars of low- to
intermediate-mass in a single dense core, and they represent different
evolutionary stages from Class 0 to Class I. Their mid- to far-infrared
spectral slopes flatten towards the Class I stage, and the 160 to 70um flux
ratio is greatest for the presumed Class 0 source. This shows that the Herschel
observations characterise the earliest stages of protostellar evolution in
detail.

expansion of the classical Maxwell's electrodynamics is presented. Expansion of
the classical electrodynamics is based on the hypothesis about an existing new
4-scalar potential complementary to the 4-vector electrodynamic potential.
4-scalar potential, from the viewpoint of the quantum field concept, describes
massless scalar particles with a zero spin whose superposition realizes the
Coulomb field. In a nonrelativistic approximation this hypothesis leads to the
theory in which along with the electric and magnetic fields there arises a new
scalar field that can propagate jointly with the electric field in vacuum in
the form of a longitudinal electroscalar wave and, thus, transport of the
Coulomb field is carried out. Indicative of the arising complementary scalar
field is the analogy between the linear theory of elasticity and Maxwell
electrodynamics considered in this work. From this analogy it follows that full
agreement between the Lame equations and Maxwell equations is reached under the
condition of incompressibility of the elastic continuum, while describing the
compressible continuum necessitates introduction of a new scalar field. Since
the 4-vector electrodynamic and new 4-scalar potentials do not form a single
geometric object in the Minkowski space-time, in a nonrelativistic
approximation the electromagnetic and electroscalar fields appear to be
independent and do not interfere. In the paper, the problem of interaction of
the introduced scalar field with charges and currents is also considered and
electrodynamics based on the Fock and Podolsky Lagrangian is briefly discussed.

super-critical regime of large $\lambda$ (the sub-critical case has been
studied in \cite{ES,KP}), where the nonlinear Hartree equation is known to have
solutions which blow up in finite time. To inspect this regime, we need to
regularize the Coulomb interaction in the many body Hamiltonian with an $N$

if the solution of the nonlinear equation does not blow up in the time interval
$[-T,T]$, then the many body Schr\""odinger dynamics (on the level of the
reduced density matrices) can be approximated by the nonlinear Hartree
dynamics, just as in the sub-critical regime. Moreover, we prove that if the
solution of the nonlinear Hartree equation blows up at time $T$ (in the sense

also the solution of the linear Schr\""odinger equation collapses (in the sense

simultaneously, $N \to \infty$ sufficiently fast. This gives the first

  photometric imaging observations of q1 Eri (HD10647, HR506)","5 pages, 3 figures",,"10.1051/0004-6361/201014601",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  About two dozen exo-solar debris systems have been spatially resolved. These
debris discs commonly display a variety of structural features such as clumps,
rings, belts, eccentric distributions and spiral patterns. In most cases, these
features are believed to be formed, shaped and maintained by the dynamical
influence of planets orbiting the host stars. In very few cases has the
presence of the dynamically important planet(s) been inferred from direct
observation. The solar-type star q1 Eri is known to be surrounded by debris,
extended on scales of < 30''. The star is known to host at least one planet,
albeit on an orbit far too small to make it responsible for structures at
distances of tens to hundreds of AU. The aim of the present investigation is
twofold: to determine the optical and material properties of the debris and to
infer the spatial distribution of the dust, which may hint at the presence of
additional planets. The photodetector array camera and spectrometer (PACS)
aboard the Herschel Space Observatory allows imaging observations in the far
infrared at unprecedented resolution, i.e. at better than 6'' to 12'' over the
wavelength range of 60 {\mu}m to 210 {\mu}m. Together with the results from
ground-based observations, these spatially resolved data can be modelled to
determine the nature of the debris and its evolution more reliably than would
be possible from unresolved data alone. For the first time has the q1 Eri disc
been resolved at far infrared wavelengths. The PACS observations at 70, 100 and
160 {\mu}m reveal an oval image showing a disc-like structure in all bands, the
size of which increases with wavelength. Assuming a circular shape yields the
inclination of its equatorial plane with respect to that of the sky, i > 53deg.
The results of image de-convolution indicate that i likely is larger than
63deg, where 90deg corresponds to an edge-on disc. {abridged}

their actual positions and properties at the present time. We find that the
reionization history of the Local Group is strongly dependent on the assumed
photon production efficiencies of the ionizing sources, which are still poorly
constrained. If sources are relatively efficient, i.e. the process is
'photon-rich', the Local Group is primarily ionized externally by the nearby
clusters. Alternatively, if the sources are inefficient, i.e. reionization is
'photon-poor' the Local Group evolves largely isolated and reionizes itself.
The mode of reionization, external vs. internal, has important implications for
the evolution of our neighbourhood, in terms of e.g. its satellite galaxy
populations and primordial stellar populations. This therefore provides an
important avenue for understanding the young universe by detailed studies of
our nearby structures.

  Application to Topology Optimization Problems",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The structure of many real-world optimization problems includes minimization
of a nonlinear (or quadratic) functional subject to bound and singly linear
constraints (in the form of either equality or bilateral inequality) which are
commonly called as continuous knapsack problems. Since there are efficient
methods to solve large-scale bound constrained nonlinear programs, it is
desirable to adapt these methods to solve knapsack problems, while preserving
their efficiency and convergence theories. The goal of this paper is to
introduce a general framework to extend a box-constrained optimization solver
to solve knapsack problems. This framework includes two main ingredients which
are O(n) methods; in terms of the computational cost and required memory; for
the projection onto the knapsack constrains and the null-space manipulation of
the related linear constraint. The main focus of this work is on the extension
of Hager-Zhang active set algorithm (SIAM J. Optim. 2006, pp. 526--557). The
main reasons for this choice was its promising efficiency in practice as well
as its excellent convergence theories (e.g., superlinear local convergence rate
without strict complementarity assumption). Moreover, this method does not use
any explicit form of second order information and/or solution of linear systems
in the course of optimization which makes it an ideal choice for large-scale
problems. Moreover, application of Birgin and Mart{\'\i}nez active set
algorithm (Comp. Opt. Appl. 2002, pp. 101--125) for knapsack problems is also
briefly commented. The feasibility of the presented algorithm is supported by
numerical results for topology optimization problems.

Finally, our mechanism is tunable, allowing each participating domain to
determine how many resources to devote to it independently (i.e., without any

at the cost of deploying modest functionality at the participating domains'

a parametric way. We construct self-consistent models of nonspherical
isothermal halos embedding a zero-thickness disk, by assuming that the halo
distribution function is a Maxwellian. The method developed here can be used to
study other physically-based choices for the halo distribution function and the
case of a disk accompanied by a bulge. In a preliminary investigation we note
the existence of a fine tuning between the scalelengths R_{\Omega} and h,
respectively characterizing the rise of the rotation curve and the luminosity
profile of the disk, which surprisingly applies to both high surface brightness
and low surface brightness galaxies. This empirical correlation identifies a
much stronger conspiracy than the one required by the smoothness and flatness
of the rotation curve (disk-halo conspiracy). The self-consistent models are
characterized by smooth and flat rotation curves for very different
disk-to-halo mass ratios, hence suggesting that conspiracy is not as dramatic
as often imagined. For a typical rotation curve, with asymptotically flat
rotation curve at V_{\infty} (the precise value of which can also be treated as
a free parameter), and a typical density profile of the disk, self-consistent
models are characterized by two dimensionless parameters, which correspond to
the dimensional scales (the disk mass-to-light ratio M/L and the halo central
density) of standard disk-halo decompositions. We show that if the rotation
curve is decomposed by means of our self-consistent models, the disk-halo
degeneracy is removed and typical rotation curves are fitted by models that are
below the maximum-disk prescription. Similar results are obtained from a study
of NGC 3198. Finally, we quantify the flattening of the spheroidal halo, which
is significant, especially on the scale of the visible disk.

spectral index. We compare spectral energy distribution (SED) templates of
local galaxies for K-correcting FIR fluxes, and show that the data are best fit
by a quiescent spiral template (M51) rather than a warm starburst (M82) or
ULIRG (Arp220), implying a predominance of cold dust in massive galaxies at
high redshift. In contrast we measure total infrared luminosities that are
consistent with high star-formation rates. We observe that the FRC index (q)
does not evolve significantly over z=0-2 when computed from K-corrected 24 or
160-mum photometry, but that using 70-mum fluxes leads to an apparent decline
in q beyond z~1. This suggests some change in the SED at high redshift, either
a steepening of the spectrum at rest-frame ~25-35mum or a deficiency at ~70mum
leading to a drop in the total infrared/radio ratios. We compare our results to
other work in the literature and find synergies with recent findings on the
high-redshift FRC, high specific star-formation rates of massive galaxies and
the cold dust temperatures in these galaxies.

viscoelastic response of a Langmuir monolayer with an accuracy of 10^-5 N/m.
This instrument is then employed for the rheological characterization of a

out of equilibrium by a suitable photoperturbation. The complex dynamic shear

predominantly elastic (G' > G'') to a viscoelastic (G' \approx G'') regime.
These results are confirmed by comparison with independent measurements
performed by us using other rheological techniques. Finally a discussion is
made, taking into account the results of a recent x-ray photon correlation

C*-algebras whose underlying poset, indexing the net, is not upward directed. A
particular class of nets, called C*-net bundles, is classified in terms of
C*-dynamical systems having as group the fundamental group of the poset. Any
net of C*-algebras embeds into a unique C*-net bundle, the enveloping net
bundle, which generalizes the notion of universal C*-algebra given by
Fredenhagen to nonsimply connected posets. This allows a classification of
nets; in particular, we call injective those nets having a faithful embedding
into the enveloping net bundle. Injectivity turns out to be equivalent to the
existence of faithful representations. We further relate injectivity to a
generalized Cech cocycle of the net, and this allows us to give examples of
nets exhausting the above classification. Using the results of this paper we
shall show, in a forthcoming paper, that any conformal net over S^1 is
injective.

  This leads in the new conclusion that the use of extractors is superior to
the use of hash functions only with the very large key lengths $\ell$ (of order

  We suggest hybrid key distribution protocols consisting from two
consecutively executed stages. At the fist stage it is generated a short
authentication key based on hash function, whereas at the second stage it is
generated the final key with the use of extractors. We show that in fact the
use of extraction procedure is effective only at the second stage. We get also
some constructive estimates of the key rates for such protocols.

have proved that any connecting orbit, which connects two hyperbolic periodic
orbits, is transverse and that there does not exist any homoclinic orbit,
connecting a hyperbolic periodic orbit to itself. In \cite{JR}, we have shown
that, generically with respect to the non-linearity $f$, all the equilibria and
periodic orbits are hyperbolic. Here we complete these results by showing that
any connecting orbit between two hyperbolic equilibria with distinct Morse
indices or between a hyperbolic equilibrium and a hyperbolic periodic orbit is
automatically transverse. We also show that, generically with respect to $f$,
there does not exist any connection between equilibria with the same Morse
index. The above properties, together with the existence of a compact global
attractor and the Poincar\'e-Bendixson property, allow us to deduce that,
generically with respect to $f$, the non-wandering set consists in a finite
number of hyperbolic equilibria and periodic orbits . The main tools in the
proofs include the lap number property, exponential dichotomies and the
Sard-Smale theorem. The proofs also require a careful analysis of the
asymptotic behavior of solutions of the linearized equations along the
connecting orbits.

2007, when it reached its peak luminosity in hard X-rays, the source was in a
bright hard state. The SPI data from this period show a good signal to noise
ratio, allowing a detailed study of the spectral energy distribution up to
several hundred keV. As a main result, we report on the detection of a variable
hard spectral feature (>150 keV) which represents a significant excess with
respect to the cutoff power law shape of the spectrum. The SPI data suggest
that the intensity of this feature is positively correlated with the 25 - 50
keV luminosity of the source and the associated variability time scale is
shorter than 7 hours. The simultaneous PCA data, however, show no significant
change in the spectral shape, indicating that the source is not undergoing a
canonical state transition. We analyzed the broad band spectra in the lights of
several physical models, assuming different heating mechanisms and properties
of the Comptonizing plasma. For the first time, we performed quantitative model
fitting with the new versatile Comptonization code BELM, accounting
self-consistently for the presence of a magnetic field. We show that a
magnetized medium subject to pure non-thermal electron acceleration provides a
framework for a physically consistent interpretation of the observed 4 - 500
keV emission. Moreover, we find that the spectral variability might be
triggered by the variations of only one physical parameter, namely the magnetic
field strength. Therefore, it appears that the magnetic field is likely to be a
key parameter in the production of the Comptonized hard X-ray emission.

formalisms for specifying and verifying real-time systems. Temporal logics have
been an important research subject within this direction. Although numerous
logics have been introduced for the formal specification of real-time and
complex systems, an up to date comprehensive analysis of these logics does not
exist in the literature. In this paper we analyse real-time and probabilistic
temporal logics which have been widely used in this field. We extrapolate the
notions of decidability, axiomatizability, expressiveness, model checking, etc.

arithmetic genus of curves in $\ls.$ For any $X$ and $g_L\leq0$, we compute the
generating function $Z^r(t)=\sum_{n}h^0(\mhu,\lcn)t^n$. For $X$ being
$\mathbb{P}^2$ or $\mathbb{P}(\mo_{\pone}\oplus\mo_{\pone}(-e))$ with $e=0,1$,
we compute $Z^1(t)$ for $g_L>0$ and $Z^r(t)$ for all $r$ and $g_L=1,2$. Our
results provide a numerical check to Strange Duality in these specified

interesting corollary in the theory of compactified Jacobian of integral

interpretation of the new planet systems that continue to emerge. The CoRoT
satellite recently discovered a transiting rocky planet with a density similar
to the inner planets in our solar system, a so-called Super Earth. This planet
is orbiting a relatively faint G9V star called CoRoT-7, and we wish to refine
its physical properties, which are important for the interpretation of the
properties of the planet system. We used spectra from HARPS@ESO-3.6m and
UVES@VLT-8.2m. From the analysis of Fe-1 and Fe-2 lines we determine Teff, log
g and microturbulence. We use the Balmer lines to constrain Teff and pressure
sensitive Mg-1b and Ca lines to constrain log g. From the analysis we find
Teff=5250+-60K, log g = 4.47+-0.05, [M/H]=+0.12+-0.06, and vsini = 1.1 km/s. We
compared the L/M ratio with isochrones to constrain the evolutionary status.
Using the age estimate of 1.2-2.3 Gyr based on stellar activity, we determine
the mass and radius 0.91+-0.03 Msun and 0.82+-0.04 Rsun. With these updated
constraints we fitted the CoRoT transit light curve for CoRoT-7b. We revise the
planet radius to be slightly smaller, R = 1.58+-0.10 Rearth, and the density
becomes higher, rho = 7.2+-1.8 g/cm3. The host star CoRoT-7 is a slowly
rotating, metal rich, unevolved type G9V star. The star is relatively faint
(V=11.7) and its fundamental parameters can only be determined through indirect
methods. Our methods rely on detailed spectral analyses that depend on the
adopted model atmospheres. From the analysis of spectra of stars with
well-known parameters with similar parameters to CoRoT-7 (the Sun and alpha Cen
B) we demonstrate that our methods are robust within the claimed uncertainties.
Therefore our methods can be reliably used in subsequent analyses of similar
exoplanet host stars.

scale of noncommutativity (NC) Lambda_NC in noncommutative gauge field theories
(NCGFT) where neutrinos possess a tree-level coupling to photons in a
generation-independent manner. In the energy range of interest (10^10 to 10^11
GeV) the theta-expansion (|theta| ~ 1/Lambda_NC^2) and therefore the
perturbative expansion in terms of Lambda_NC retains no longer its meaningful
character, forcing us to resort to those NC field-theoretical frameworks
involving the full theta-resummation. Our numerical analysis of the
contribution to the process coming from the photon exchange, pins impeccably
down a lower bound on Lambda_NC to be as high as around up to 900 (450) TeV,
depending on the estimates for the cosmogenic neutrino flux. If, on the other
hand, one considers a surprising recent result occurred in Pierre Auger
Observatory (PAO) data, that UHE cosmic rays are mainly composed of
highly-ionized Fe nuclei, then our bounds get weaker, due to the diminished
cosmic neutrino flux. Nevertheless, we show that even for the very high
fraction of heavy nuclei in primary UHE cosmic rays, our method may still yield
remarkable bounds on Lambda_NC, typically always above 200 TeV. Albeit, in this
case one encounters a maximal value for the Fe fraction from which any useful
information on Lambda_NC can be drawn, delimiting thus the applicability of our
method.

X-ray binary (NS-LMXB) XTE J1701-462, obtained during its 2006-2007 outburst.
The X-ray properties of the source changed between those of various types of
NS-LMXB subclasses. At high luminosities the source switched between two types
of Z source behavior and at low luminosities we observed a transition from Z
source to atoll source behavior. These transitions between subclasses primarily
manifest themselves as changes in the shapes of the tracks in X-ray color-color
and hardness-intensity diagrams, but they are accompanied by changes in the kHz
quasi-periodic oscillations, broad-band variability, burst behavior, and/or
X-ray spectra. We find that the low-energy X-ray flux is a good parameter to
track the gradual evolution of the tracks in color-color and hardness-intensity
diagrams, allowing us to resolve the evolution of the source in greater detail
than before and relate the observed properties to other NS-LMXBs. We further
find that during the transition from Z to atoll, characteristic behavior known
as the atoll upper banana can equivalently be described as the final stage of a
weakening Z source flaring branch, thereby blurring the line between the two
subclasses. Our findings strongly suggest that the wide variety in behavior
observed in NS-LXMBs with different luminosities can be linked through changes
in a single variable parameter, namely the mass accretion rate, without the
need for additional differences in the neutron star parameters or viewing
angle. We briefly discuss the implications of our findings for the spectral
changes observed in NS LMXBs and suggest that, contrary to what is often
assumed, the position along the color-color tracks of Z sources is not
determined by the instantaneous mass accretion rate.

the radius in the accretion disk in which it is produced, our results suggest
that in XTE J1701-462 the coherence and rms amplitude are not uniquely related
to this radius. Here we argue that this difference is instead due to a change
in the properties of the accretion flow around the neutron star. Regardless of
the precise mechanism, our result shows that effects other than the geometry of
space time around the neutron star have a strong influence on the coherence and
rms amplitude of the kHz QPOs, and therefore the coherence and rms amplitude of
the kHz QPOs cannot be simply used to deduce the existence of the innermost
stable circular orbit around a neutron star.

Sources with low radio power form the bulk of the radio-loud AGN population but

  We here analyze their photometric and spectroscopic properties. From the

luminosity. The hosts of LEG are red, massive Early-Type Galaxies (ETG) with
large black holes masses , statistically indistinguishable from the hosts of
low redshift 3CR/LEG sources. No genuine radio-loud LEG could be found
associated with black holes with a mass substantially lower than 10^8 M(sun) or
with a late type host. The fraction of galaxies with signs of star formation
(5%) is similar to what is found in both the quiescent ETG and 3CR/LEG hosts.
We conclude that the deficit in radio emission cannot be ascribed to
differences in the properties of their hosts. We argue that instead this could
be due to a temporal evolution of the radio luminosity.
  A minority (10%) of the sample show rather different properties, being
associated with low black hole masses, with spiral galaxies, or showing a high
excitation spectrum. In general these outliers are the result of the
contamination from Seyfert and from galaxies where the radio emission is

overcome certain limitations of standard voxel-based testing methods, as
implemented in the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) software, we introduce
a Bayesian model selection approach to this problem, meaning that the most
probable model of cerebral activity given the data is selected from a
pre-defined collection of possible models. Based on a parcellation of the brain
volume into functionally homogeneous regions, each model corresponds to a
partition of the regions into those involved in the task under study and those
inactive. This allows to incorporate prior information, and avoids the
dependence of the SPM-like approach on an arbitrary threshold, called the
cluster- forming threshold, to define active regions. By controlling a Bayesian
risk, our approach balances false positive and false negative risk control.
Furthermore, it is based on a generative model that accounts for the spatial
uncertainty on the localization of individual effects, due to spatial
normalization errors. On both simulated and real fMRI datasets, we show that
this new paradigm corrects several biases of the SPM-like approach, which
either swells or misses the different active regions, depending on the choice
of a cluster-forming threshold.
