in quantum communication network. To overcome the unavoidable decoherence in
noisy channel, to date, many efforts have focused on faithfully transmitting
one state by consuming large numbers of synchronized ancillary states. However,
huge demands of quantum resources are hard to meet with current technology,
thus restrict practical applications. Here we propose and demonstrate an
economical method of reliably transmitting quantum information. An arbitrary
unknown quantum state is converted into time bins deterministically in terms of
its own polarization using a modified Franson interferometer. Any arisen noise
in channel will induce an associated error to the reference frame of the time
bins, which can be utilized to reject errors and recover the initial state. By
virtue of state-independent feature, our method can be applied to entanglement
distribution. After passing through 0.8 km randomly twisted optical fiber, the
entanglement still survives and is verified. Our approach significantly
simplifies the implementation of quantum EFT and enables a general quantum
state even entanglement to be protected by feedback, thus can be used as a
basic building block in practical long-distance quantum communication network.

integral-differential equation of radiative transfer, we investigate the flux
of the Ly$\alpha$ photon $\nu_0$ emergent from an optically thick halo
containing a central light source. Our focus is on the time-dependent effects
of the resonant scattering. We first show that the frequency distribution of
photons in the halo are quickly approaching to a locally thermalized state
around the resonant frequency, even when the mean intensity of the radiation is
highly time-dependent. Since initial conditions are forgotten during the
thermalization, some features of the flux, such as the two peak structure of
its profile, actually are independent of the intrinsic width and time behavior
of the central source, if the emergent photons are mainly from photons in the
thermalized state. In this case, the difference $|\nu_{\pm}-\nu_0|$, where
$\nu_{\pm}$ are the frequencies of the two peaks of the flux, cannot be less
than $2$ times of Doppler broadening. We then study the radiative transfer in
the case where the light emitted from the central source is a flash. We
calculate the light curves of the flux from the halo. It shows that the flux is
still a flash. The time duration of the flash for the flux, however, is
independent of the original time duration of the light source but depends on
the optical depth of the halo. Therefore, the spatial transfer of resonant
photons is a diffusion process, even though it is not a purely Brownian
diffusion. This property enables an optically thick halo to trap and store
thermalized photons around $\nu_0$ for a long time after the cease of the
central source emission. The photons trapped in the halo can yield delayed
emission, of which the profile also shows typical two peak structure as that
from locally thermalized photons. Possible applications of these results are
addressed.

redshift for 0 < z < 3. The most luminous starbursts and AGN evolve as
(1+z)^{2.5} to z ~ 2.5; no clear evidence is found that this evolution ceases
beyond z = 2.5. Dust obscuration in starbursts is determined by comparing PAH
luminosity with ultraviolet luminosity and indicates severe obscuration in most
starbursts, even those selected in the ultraviolet; the median ratio (intrinsic
ultraviolet/observed ultraviolet) is ~ 50 for infrared selected starbursts and
~ 8 for ultraviolet selected starbursts. Obscuration increases with bolometric
luminosity, but starbursts which appear most luminous in the ultraviolet are
those with the least obscuration. This result indicates that extinction
corrections are significantly underestimated for ultraviolet selected sources,

the present paper the effects of confinement on this model colloidal fluid

diagram, resulting from competition between the three relevant length scales:
pore width $h$, smectic period $d$ and length ratio $s$. Four main effects are
identified: (i) Second-order bulk N-S transitions are suppressed. (ii) Demixing
transitions are weakly affected, with small shifts in the $\mu_1-\mu_2$
(chemical potentials) plane. (iii) Confinement-induced layering (CIL)
transitions occurring in the two confined one-component fluids in some cases
merge with the demixing transition. (iv) Surface-induced layering (SIL)
transitions occurring at a single surface as coexistence conditions are
approached are also shifted in the confined fluid. Trends with pore size are
analysed by means of complete $\mu_1-\mu_2$ and $p-\bar{x}$ (pressure-mean pore

which is the first one to address the behaviour of liquid-crystalline mixtures

Using a spectral atmosphere code, we integrate over the face of the planet seen

function of wavelength and for different photometric bands. The products of
this study are generic predictions for the phase variations of a
zero-eccentricity giant planet's transit spectrum and of its light curves. We
find that for these models the temporal variations in all quantities and the
ingress/egress contrasts in the transit radii are small ($< 1.0$\%). Moreover,
we determine that the day/night contrasts and phase shifts of the brightness
peaks relative to the ephemeris are functions of photometric band. The $J$,
$H$, and $K$ bands are shifted most, while the IRAC bands are shifted least.
Therefore, we verify that the magnitude of the downwind shift in the planetary
``hot spot"" due to equatorial winds is strongly wavelength-dependent. The phase
and wavelength dependence of light curves, and the associated day/night
contrasts, can be used to constrain the circulation regime of irradiated giant
planets and to probe different pressure levels of a hot Jupiter atmosphere. We
posit that though our calculations focus on models of HD 209458b similar
calculations for other transiting hot Jupiters in low-eccentricity orbits

  Function of Network Structure","This paper is the expanded version of the paper with the same name
  which is accepted by the IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control. The final
  version is updated on Oct. 12, 2010",,"10.1109/TAC.2010.2103416",,"nlin.AO math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the problem of distributed formation control of a large number of
vehicles. An individual vehicle in the formation is assumed to be a fully
actuated point mass. A distributed control law is examined: the control action
on an individual vehicle depends on (i) its own velocity and (ii) the relative
position measurements with a small subset of vehicles (neighbors) in the
formation. The neighbors are defined according to an information graph.
  In this paper we describe a methodology for modeling, analysis, and
distributed control design of such vehicular formations whose information graph
is a D-dimensional lattice. The modeling relies on an approximation based on a
partial differential equation (PDE) that describes the spatio-temporal
evolution of position errors in the formation. The analysis and control design
is based on the PDE model. We deduce asymptotic formulae for the closed-loop
stability margin (absolute value of the real part of the least stable
eigenvalue) of the controlled formation. The stability margin is shown to
approach 0 as the number of vehicles N goes to infinity. The exponent on the
scaling law for the stability margin is influenced by the dimension and the
structure of the information graph. We show that the scaling law can be
improved by employing a higher dimensional information graph.
  Apart from analysis, the PDE model is used for a mistuning-based design of
control gains to maximize the stability margin. Mistuning here refers to small
perturbation of control gains from their nominal symmetric values. We show that
the mistuned design can have a significantly better stability margin even with
a small amount of perturbation. The results of the analysis with the PDE model
are corroborated with numerical computation of eigenvalues with the state-space
model of the formation.

the pairing between fermions is mediated by a gauge boson, whose propagator
remains massless in a paramagnet. We relate the MS model to a generic
\gamma-model of quantum-critical pairing with the pairing kernel \lambda
(\Omega) \propto 1/\Omega^{\gamma}. We show that, over some range of
parameters, the MS model is equivalent to the \gamma-model with \gamma =1/3

range where this analogy works is bounded on both ends. At larger deviations
from a magnetic phase, the MS model becomes equivalent to the \gamma-model with
varying \gamma >1/3, whose value depends on the distance to a magnetic
transition and approaches \gamma =1 deep in a paramagnetic phase. Very near the

wide-band detectors. For such wide bandwidths, dispersive atmospheric effects
introduce variations in the fringe delay which change through the band of the
receivers. These undesired dispersive effects must be estimated and calibrated
with the highest precision. We studied the achievable precision in the estimate
of the ionospheric dispersion and the dynamic range of the correlated fringes
for different distributions of sub-bands in low-frequency and wide-band
interferometric observations. Our study is focused on the case of sub-bands
with a bandwidth much narrower than that of the total covered spectrum (case of
LOFAR). We computed the uncertainty of the ionospheric delay, the delay
ambiguity, and the dynamic range of the fringes using four different kinds of
sub-band distributions: constant spacing between sub-bands, random spacings,
spacings based on a power-law distribution, and spacings based on Golomb rulers
(sets of integers whose sets of differences have non-repeated elements). For a
large number of sub-bands ($> 20$, depending on the delay window) spacings
based on Golomb rulers give the most precise estimates of dispersive effects
and the highest fringe dynamic ranges. Spacings based on the power-law
distribution give similar results, although better than those with the Golomb
rulers for smaller number of sub-bands. Random distributions result in large
fringe dynamic ranges, but the estimate of dispersive effects is worse. A
constant spacing of sub-bands results in very bad fringe dynamic ranges, but
good estimates of ionospheric dispersion. Combining all the results, the
power-law distribution gives the best compromise between homogeneity in the
bandwidth sampling, precision in the estimate of ionospheric effects, dynamic
range of the correlated fringes, and group-delay ambiguity.

commonly interpreted as a reflection of synchronized network activity, but its
relationship to observed transient coincident firing of neurons on the
millisecond time-scale remains unclear. Here we present experimental evidence
to reconcile the notions of synchrony at the level of neuronal spiking and at
the mesoscopic scale. We demonstrate that only in time intervals of excess
spike synchrony, coincident spikes are better entrained to the LFP than
predicted by the locking of the individual spikes. This effect is enhanced in
periods of large LFP amplitudes. A quantitative model explains the LFP dynamics
by the orchestrated spiking activity in neuronal groups that contribute the
observed surplus synchrony. From the correlation analysis, we infer that
neurons participate in different constellations but contribute only a fraction
of their spikes to temporally precise spike configurations, suggesting a dual
coding scheme of rate and synchrony. This finding provides direct evidence for
the hypothesized relation that precise spike synchrony constitutes a major
temporally and spatially organized component of the LFP. Revealing that
transient spike synchronization correlates not only with behavior, but with a
mesoscopic brain signal corroborates its relevance in cortical processing.

solution of the Painleve I equation. We argue that the Painleve I equation
provides an integrable deformation of the Hele-Shaw problem which describes
flow passing through singularities. In this interpretation shocks appear as
Stokes level-lines of the Painleve linear problem.

and the [Ne V]3426 emission line flux (X/NeV) as a diagnostic diagram to
discover heavily obscured, possibly Compton-Thick Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN)
up to z~1.5. First, we calibrate a relation between X/NeV and the cold
absorbing column density N_H using a sample of 74 bright, nearby Seyferts with
both X-ray and [Ne V] data available in the literature. Similarly to what is
found for the X-ray to [O III]5007 flux ratio (X/OIII), we found that the X/NeV
ratio decreases towards large column densities. Essentially all local Seyferts
with X/NeV values below 15 are found to be Compton-Thick objects. Second, we
apply this diagnostic diagram to different samples of distant obscured and
unobscured QSOs in the SDSS: blue, unobscured, type-1 QSOs in the redshift
range z=[0.1-1.5] show X/NeV values typical of unobscured Seyfert 1s in the
local Universe. Conversely, SDSS type-2 QSOs at z~0.5 classified either as
Compton-Thick or Compton-Thin on the basis of their X/OIII ratio, would have
been mostly classified in the same way based on the X/NeV ratio. We apply the
X/NeV diagnostic diagram to 9 SDSS obscured QSOs in the redshift range
z=[0.85-1.31], selected by means of their prominent [Ne V]3426 line and
observed with Chandra ACIS-S for 10ks each. Based on the X/NeV ratio,
complemented by X-ray spectral analysis, 2 objects appear good Compton-Thick
QSO candidates, 4 objects appear as Compton-Thin QSOs, while 3 have an
ambiguous classification. When excluding from the sample broad lined QSOs with
a red continuum and thus considering only genuine narrow-line objects, the
efficiency in selecting Compton-Thick QSOs through the [Ne V] line is about 50%
(with large errors, though), more similar to what is achieved with [O III]
selection. [abridged]

R-current correlators on a finite-size shock wave using AdS/CFT correspondence.
We improve on the existing results in the literature by going beyond the
eikonal approximation for the two lowest orders in graviton exchanges. We argue
that since the eikonal approximation at strong coupling resums integer powers
of 1/x (with x the Bjorken-x variable), the non-eikonal corrections bringing in
positive integer powers of x can not be neglected in the small-x limit, as the
non-eikonal order-x correction to the (n+1)st term in the eikonal series is of
the same order in x as the nth eikonal term in that series. We demonstrate
that, in qualitative agreement with the earlier DIS analysis based on
calculation of the expectation value of the Wilson loop in the shock wave
background using AdS/CFT, after inclusion of non-eikonal corrections DIS
structure functions are described by two momentum scales: Q_1^2 ~ \Lambda^2 \,
A^{1/3}/x and Q_2^2 ~ \Lambda^2 \, A^{2/3}, where \Lambda is the typical
transverse momentum in the shock wave and A is the atomic number if the shock

fading channels is studied under quality of service (QoS) constraints and
channel uncertainty. Cognitive secondary users (SUs) are assumed to initially
perform channel sensing to detect the activities of the primary users, and then
attempt to estimate the channel fading coefficients through training. Energy
detection is employed for channel sensing, and different minimum
mean-square-error (MMSE) estimation methods are considered for channel
estimation. In both channel sensing and estimation, erroneous decisions can be
made, and hence, channel uncertainty is not completely eliminated. In this
setting, performance is studied and interactions between channel sensing and
estimation are investigated.
  Following the channel sensing and estimation tasks, SUs engage in data
transmission. Transmitter, being unaware of the channel fading coefficients, is
assumed to send the data at fixed power and rate levels that depend on the
channel sensing results. Under these assumptions, a state-transition model is
constructed by considering the reliability of the transmissions, channel
sensing decisions and their correctness, and the evolution of primary user
activity which is modeled as a two-state Markov process. In the data
transmission phase, an average power constraint on the secondary users is
considered to limit the interference to the primary users, and statistical
limitations on the buffer lengths are imposed to take into account the QoS
constraints of the secondary traffic. The maximum throughput under these
statistical QoS constraints is identified by finding the effective capacity of
the cognitive radio channel. Numerical results are provided for the power and
rate policies.

Sznitman proved that $(T')$ implies a ballistic law of large numbers.
Furthermore, he showed that for all $\gamma\in (0.5,1)$, $(T)_{\gamma}$ is
equivalent to $(T')$. Recently, Berger has proved that in dimensions larger
than three, for each $\gamma\in (0,1)$, condition $(T)_{\gamma}$ implies a

is established employing a sharp estimate for the probability of atypical
quenched exit distributions of the walk leaving certain boxes. In this context,
we also obtain an affirmative answer to a conjecture raised by Sznitman in 2004
concerning these probabilities. A key ingredient for our estimates is the
multiscale method developed recently by Berger.

understanding of the jet formation mechanism through a combination of numerical
simulations and analytical MHD models for outflows characterized by the
symmetry of self-similarity. In a previous article we introduced models of
truncated jets from disks, i.e. evolved in time numerical simulations based on
a radially self-similar MHD solution, but including the effects of a finite
radius of the jet-emitting disk and thus the outflow. These models need now to
be compared with available observational data. A direct comparison of the
results of combined analytical theoretical models and numerical simulations
with observations has not been performed as yet. In order to compare our models
with observed jet widths inferred from recent optical images taken with HST and
AO observations, we use a new set of tools to create emission maps in different
forbidden lines, from which we determine the jet width as the FWHM of the
emission. It is shown that the untruncated analytical disk outflow solution
considered here cannot fit the small jet widths inferred by observations of
several jets. Various truncated disk-wind models are examined, whose extracted
jet widths range from higher to lower values compared to the observations. Thus
we can fit the observed range of jet widths by tuning our models. We conclude
that truncation is necessary to reproduce the observed jet widths and our
simulations limit the possible range of truncation radii. We infer that the
truncation radius, which is the radius on the disk mid-plane where the
jet-emitting disk switches to a standard disk, must be between around 0.1 up to
about 1 AU in the observed sample for the considered disk-wind solution. One
disk-wind simulation with an inner truncation radius at about 0.11 AU also
shows potential for reproducing the observations, but a parameter study is
needed.

population of Pal 14 is likely to be close to the primordial binary population.
Artificial clusters are generated with the observed properties of Pal 14 and
the velocity dispersion within these clusters is measured as Jordi et al.
(2009) have done with 17 observed stars of Pal 14. We discuss the effect of the
binary population on these measurements and find that the small velocity
dispersion of 0.38 km/s which has been found by Jordi et al. (2009) would imply
a binary fraction of less than 0.1, even though from the stellar density of Pal
14 we would expect a binary fraction of more than 0.5. We also discuss the
effect of mass segregation on the velocity dispersion as possible explanation
for this discrepancy, but find that it would increase the velocity dispersion
further. Thus, either Pal 14 has a very unusual stellar population and its
birth process was significantly different than we see in today's star forming
regions, or the binary population is regular and we would have to correct the
observed 0.38 km/s for binarity. In this case the true velocity dispersion of
Pal 14 would be much smaller than this value and the cluster would have to be
considered as ""kinematically frigid"", thereby possibly posing a challenge for
Newtonian dynamics but in the opposite sense to MOND.

mergers. Rather, the bulge appears to be a bar, seen somewhat end-on, as hinted
from its asymmetric boxy shape. We construct a simple but realistic N-body
model of the Galaxy that self-consistently develops a bar. The bar immediately
buckles and thickens in the vertical direction. As seen from the Sun, the
result resembles the boxy bulge of our Galaxy. The model fits the BRAVA stellar
kinematic data covering the whole bulge strikingly well with no need for a
merger-made classical bulge. The bar in our best fit model has a half-length of
~ 4kpc and extends 20 degrees from the Sun-Galactic Center line. We use the new
kinematic constraints to show that any classical bulge contribution cannot be
larger than ~ 8% of the disk mass. Thus the Galactic bulge is a part of the
disk and not a separate component made in a prior merger. Giant, pure-disk
galaxies like our own present a major challenge to the standard picture in
which galaxy formation is dominated by hierarchical clustering and galaxy
mergers.

directions of the deep and wide surveys are slightly different, and combining
them breaks these degeneracies effectively. A variable depth survey with a few
thousand clusters is as effective at constraining cosmological parameters as a
single depth survey with a much larger cluster sample.

form a subset of a much larger sample, assembled to build cluster number counts
dn/dz. On using this d_A(z), the dark energy constraints can be improved by
factors of 1.5 - 4, over those from just dn/dn. Even in the presence of a mass
follow-up of 100 clusters (done for mass calibration), the dark energy
constraints can be further tightened by factors of 2 - 3 . Adding d_A(z) from
clusters is similar to adding d_L(z), from the SNe observations; for eg., dn/dn

dissipation of magnetic energy powers the flares. We show that episodic
magnetic reconnection can occur near the last stable circular orbit in
time-dependent magnetohydrodynamic simulations of black hole accretion - the
timescales and energetics of these events are broadly consistent with the
flares from Sgr A*. Motivated by these results, we present a spatially one-zone
time-dependent model for the electron distribution function in flares,
including energy loss due to synchrotron cooling and adiabatic expansion.
Synchrotron emission from transiently accelerated particles can explain the
NIR/X-ray lightcurves and spectra of a luminous flare observed 4 April 2007. A
significant decrease in the magnetic field strength during the flare
(coincident with the electron acceleration) is required to explain the
simultaneity and symmetry of the simultaneous lightcurves. Our models predict
that the NIR and X-ray spectral indices differ by 0.5 and that there is only
modest variation in the spectral index during flares. We also explore
implications of this model for longer wavelength (radio-submm) emission
seemingly associated with X-ray and NIR flares; we argue that a few hour
decrease in the submm emission is a more generic consequence of large-scale
magnetic reconnection than delayed radio emission from adiabatic expansion.

nonequilibrium statistical mechanics with quantum field theory by considering
an ensemble of interacting identical bosons or fermions as an example. Readers
are assumed to be familiar with the Matsubara formalism of equilibrium
statistical mechanics such as Feynman diagrams, the proper self-energy, and
Dyson's equation. The aims are threefold: (i) to explain the fundamentals of
nonequilibrium quantum field theory as simple as possible on the basis of the
knowledge of the equilibrium counterpart; (ii) to elucidate the hierarchy in
describing nonequilibrium systems from Dyson's equation on the Keldysh contour
to the Navier-Stokes equation in fluid mechanics via quantum transport
equations and the Boltzmann equation; (iii) to derive an expression of
nonequilibrium entropy that evolves with time. In stage (i), we introduce
nonequilibrium Green's function and the self-energy uniquely on the round-trip
Keldysh contour, thereby avoiding possible confusions that may arise from
defining multiple Green's functions at the very beginning. We try to present
the Feynman rules for the perturbation expansion as simple as possible. In
particular, we focus on the self-consistent perturbation expansion with the
Luttinger-Ward thermodynamic functional, i.e., Baym's Phi-derivable
approximation, which has a crucial property for nonequilibrium systems of
obeying various conservation laws automatically. We also show how the
two-particle correlations can be calculated within the Phi-derivable
approximation, i.e., an issue of how to handle the

SL models, bringing our SL+WL constraints in line with other recent
derivations. Our results support those of previous studies which find A1689 has
either an anomalously large concentration or significant extra mass along the
line of sight (perhaps in part due to triaxiality). If clusters are generally
found to have higher concentrations than realized in simulations, this could
indicate they formed earlier, perhaps as a result of early dark energy.

to a multimode superconducting resonator. We detect a dc flux and frequency
dependent response whose dissipative and non dissipative components are related
by a simple Debye relaxation law with a characteristic time of the order of the
diffusion time through the N part of the ring. The flux dependence exhibits
$h/2e$ periodic oscillations with a large harmonics content at temperatures
where the Josephson current is purely sinusoidal. This is explained considering
that the populations of the Andreev levels are frozen on the time-scale of the
experiments.

algorithms, such as the Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRTs) have been shown
to work well in practice and to possess theoretical guarantees such as
probabilistic completeness. However, no theoretical bounds on the quality of
the solution obtained by these algorithms have been established so far. The
first contribution of this paper is a negative result: it is proven that, under
mild technical conditions, the cost of the best path in the RRT converges
almost surely to a non-optimal value. Second, a new algorithm is considered,
called the Rapidly-exploring Random Graph (RRG), and it is shown that the cost
of the best path in the RRG converges to the optimum almost surely. Third, a
tree version of RRG is introduced, called the RRT$^*$ algorithm, which
preserves the asymptotic optimality of RRG while maintaining a tree structure
like RRT. The analysis of the new algorithms hinges on novel connections
between sampling-based motion planning algorithms and the theory of random
geometric graphs. In terms of computational complexity, it is shown that the
number of simple operations required by both the RRG and RRT$^*$ algorithms is
asymptotically within a constant factor of that required by RRT.

search on a metric space is related to the expansion of the metric space. Given
a metric space we look at the graph obtained by connecting every pair of points
within a certain distance $r$ . We then look at various notions of expansion in
this graph relating them to the cell probe complexity of NNS for randomized and
deterministic, exact and approximate algorithms. For example if the graph has
node expansion $\Phi$ then we show that any deterministic $t$-probe data
structure for $n$ points must use space $S$ where $(St/n)^t > \Phi$. We show
similar results for randomized algorithms as well. These relationships can be
used to derive most of the known lower bounds in the well known metric spaces
such as $l_1$, $l_2$, $l_\infty$ by simply computing their expansion. In the
process, we strengthen and generalize our previous results (FOCS 2008).
Additionally, we unify the approach in that work and the communication
complexity based approach. Our work reduces the problem of proving cell probe
lower bounds of near neighbor search to computing the appropriate expansion
parameter. In our results, as in all previous results, the dependence on $t$ is
weak; that is, the bound drops exponentially in $t$. We show a much stronger
(tight) time-space tradeoff for the class of dynamic low contention data
structures. These are data structures that supports updates in the data set and
that do not look up any single cell too often.

Here the induced spin-density-wave (SDW) ordering of itinerant electrons and

together via a Hund's rule coupling. We show that the Goldstone theorem still
holds at the RPA level with the gapless spin wave protected inside the small
SDW gap of itinerant electrons, which, however, is fragile in the presence of
ion-anisotropy. A gapped out-of-phase spin mode extending over a much wider
energy scale above the SDW gap is found to be more robust against the
ion-anisotropy, which is mainly contributed by the local moment fluctuations.
While the scattering between the Goldstone mode and itinerant electrons
diminishes within the SDW gap, the out-of-phase mode will strongly interact
with itinerant electrons and thus dominate the spin and charge dynamics in such
an ordered phase. Possible relevance of such a model to the iron-pnictides will
be also discussed.

radiative efficiency of accretion on to the hole, and therefore impacts the
amount of fuel required for the black hole to reach a certain mass. Thus, a
knowledge of the SMBH spin distribution and evolution is necessary to develop a
comprehensive theory of the growth of SMBHs and their impact on galaxy
formation. Currently, the only direct measurement of SMBH spin is through
fitting the broad Fe K line in AGNs. The evolution of spins could be determined
by fitting the broad line in the integrated spectra of AGNs over different
redshift intervals. The accuracy of these measurements will depend on the
observed integrated line strength. Here, we present theoretical predictions of
the integrated relativistic Fe K line strength as a function of redshift and
AGN luminosity. The equivalent widths of the integrated lines are much less
than 300 eV. Searches for the integrated line will be easiest for unobscured
AGNs with 2-10 keV luminosities between 44 < log L_{X} <= 45. The total
integrated line makes up less than 4% of the X-ray background, but its shape is
sensitive to the average SMBH spin. By following these recommendations, future
International X-ray Observatory surveys of broad Fe K lines should be able to
determine the spin evolution of SMBHs.

propagators. We analyze the partition function and main thermodynamic
properties arising from perturbative thermal loops. We focus on the p-adic
models associated with the tachyon phenomenology in string theories. We
reproduce well known features of these theories, but also obtain many new
results. In particular, we explain how to maintain consistency of such
non-local theories by avoiding the appearance of ghosts at finite temperature.
As a consequence of this fact, the vacuum energy in p-adic theories becomes
positive. It is also hierarchically suppressed, and we explore the parameter
space where it is consistent with the observed value of the cosmological
constant.

as follows: let $W_{\bullet} = \{W_k \}$ be the complete graded linear series

bifurcation nodes of this infinite tree can be endowed with a Sobolev space

of ends with the ring Z_2 of 2-adic integers. Sobolev spaces over Z_2 can be
defined in a very natural way by means of Fourier transform, which allows us to
establish precised trace theorems which are formally quite similar to those in
standard Sobolev spaces, with a Sobolev regularity which depends on the growth
rate of resistances, i.e. on geometrical properties of the tree. Furthermore,
we exhibit an explicit expression of the ""ventilation operator"", which maps
pressure fields at the end of the tree onto fluxes, in the form of a
convolution by a Riesz kernel based on the 2-adic distance.

density is required to match the measured local black hole mass density at z=0.
ADAFs are supposed to present in low luminosity AGNs/normal galaxies, which are
very hot and radiate mostly in the hard X-ray band. Most of the XRB is
contributed by bright AGNs, and a variety of AGN population synthesis models
were developed to model the observed XRB in the last two decades. Based on our
derived black hole mass density, we calculate the contribution to the XRB from
the ADAFs in faint AGNs/normal galaxies with a given Eddington ratio
distribution, which is mostly in hard X-ray energy band with an energy peak at
~200 keV. The growth of massive black holes during ADAF phase can therefore be
constrained with the observed XRB. Combining an AGN population synthesis model
with our results, we find that the fitting on the observed XRB, especially at
hard X-ray energy band with \ga 100 keV, is improved provided the contribution
of the ADAFs in low luminosity AGNs/normal galaxies is properly included. It is
found that less than ~15 per cent of local massive black hole mass density was
accreted during ADAF phases. We suggest that more accurate measurements of the
XRB in the energy band with \ga 100 keV in the future may help constrain the
growth of massive black holes at their late stage. We also calculate their
contribution to the extragalactic gamma-ray background, and find that less than

scale invariance in this trap, for both bosons and fermions. We give analytical
results for a Thomas-Fermi treatment. We calculate the heating due to loading a

to entropy density ratio of 1/4\pi can be associated with a Rindler causal

duality for this spacetime, a natural microscopic explanation for this
viscosity is in the peculiar properties of quantum entanglement. In particular,
it is well-known that the Minkowski vacuum state is a thermal state and carries
an area entanglement entropy density in the Rindler spacetime. Based on the
fluctuation-dissipation theorem, we expect a similar notion of viscosity
arising from vacuum fluctuations. Therefore, we propose a holographic Kubo
formula in terms of a two-point function of the stress tensor of matter fields
in the bulk. We calculate this viscosity assuming a minimally coupled scalar
field theory and find that the ratio with respect to the entanglement entropy
density is exactly 1/4\pi in four dimensions. The issues that arise in
extending this result to non-minimally coupled scalar fields, higher spins, and

Microwave Background (CMB) and matter power spectra, and also from limits on a
stochastic background of gravitational waves provided by pulsar timing. We
discuss the different approaches to modeling string evolution and radiation. In
particular, we show that the unconnected segment model can describe CMB spectra
expected from thin string (Nambu) and field theory (Abelian-Higgs) simulations
using the computed values for the correlation length, rms string velocity and
small-scale structure relevant to each variety of simulation. Applying the
computed spectra in a fit to CMB and SDSS data we find that $G\mu/c^2<
2.6\times 10^{-7}$ ($2 \sigma$) if the Nambu simulations are correct and $G\mu
/c^2< 6.4\times 10^{-7}$ in the Abelian-Higgs case. The degeneracy between
$G\mu/c^2$ and the power spectrum slope $n_{\rm S}$ is substantially reduced
from previous work. Inclusion of constraints on the baryon density from Big
Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) imply that $n_{\rm S} <1$ at around the $4\sigma$
level for both the Nambu and Abelian-Higgs cases. As a by-product of our
results, we find there is ""moderate-to-strong"" Bayesian evidence that the
Harrison-Zel'dovich spectrum is excluded (odds ratio of $\sim 100:1$) by the
combination of CMB, SDSS and BBN when compared to the standard 6 parameter fit.
Using the contribution to the gravitational wave background from radiation era
loops as a conservative lower bound on the signal for specific values of
$G\mu/c^2$ and loop production size, $\alpha$, we find that $G\mu /c^2< 7\times

$i,j$ of distinct integers with $1\leq i,j\leq \ell$. A collection
$\{T_1,T_2,...,T_\ell\}$ of trees in $G$ with this property is called an
internally disjoint set of trees connecting $S$. Chartrand et al. generalized
the concept of connectivity as follows: The $k$-$connectivity$, denoted by
$\kappa_k(G)$, of $G$ is defined by $\kappa_k(G)=$min$\{\kappa(S)\}$, where the
minimum is taken over all $k$-subsets $S$ of $V(G)$. Thus
$\kappa_2(G)=\kappa(G)$, where $\kappa(G)$ is the connectivity of $G$, for
which there are polynomial-time algorithms to solve it. This paper mainly focus
on the complexity of the generalized connectivity. At first, we obtain that for
two fixed positive integers $k_1$ and $k_2$, given a graph $G$ and a
$k_1$-subset $S$ of $V(G)$, the problem of deciding whether $G$ contains $k_2$
internally disjoint trees connecting $S$ can be solved by a polynomial-time
algorithm. Then, we show that when $k_1$ is a fixed integer of at least 4, but
$k_2$ is not a fixed integer, the problem turns out to be NP-complete. On the
other hand, when $k_2$ is a fixed integer of at least 2, but $k_1$ is not a

on Z, is also isometric. In the present paper we take, in the capacity of A,
the algebra c_0 of vanishing sequences and consider the class of the so-called
homogeneous modules, over the latter algebra, denoted by H. The main theorem
gives a full description of essential homogeneous modules over the mentioned
algebra that are extremely flat with respect to H. (In particular, all
l_p-sums; p<infinity of normed spaces of integrable functions on different
measure spaces have the indicated property). As a corollary, some theorems of
Hahn-Banach type, concerning extensions of c_0-module morphisms with
preservation of their norms, are obtained. (In particular, l_p-sums of normed
spaces of essentially bounded functions play, in the relevant context, the same
role as the scalar field in the classical Hahn-Banach Theorem). Besides, the
following related result is established. If I is a topologically injective
morphism of normed c_0-modules, then for every normed c_0-module Z, the
non-completed projective tensor product of I and the identity morphism on Z is
also injective (despite it is, generally speaking, not topologically
injective). If I is a (just) injective bounded morphism, then such a tensor
product is not bound to be injective. Finally, it is shown that we can not omit
the word ""essential"" in the formulation of the main theorem. Namely, the
non-essential homogeneous c_0-module of all bounded sequences is not extremely
flat with respect to H.

it to the analysis of observational data. The galaxy models in use where
calculated by the Padova group in two different cosmological scenarios: the
SCDM, and the Lambda CDM. For these models, we recover their
spectro-photometric evolution through the entire history of the Universe. We
computed magnitudes and colors and their evolution with the redshift along with
the evolutionary and cosmological corrections for the model galaxies at our
disposal, and compared them with data for ETGs taken from the COSMOS and the
GOODS databases. Starting from the dynamical simulations and photometric models
at our disposal, we created synthetic images from which we derived the
structural and morphological parameters. The theoretical results are compared
with observational data of ETGs selected form the SDSS database. The simulated
colors for the different cosmological scenarios follow the general trend shown
by galaxies of the COSMOS and GOODS. Within the redshift range considered, all

bridge to simulate the accumulation of paid claims, allowing for an essentially
arbitrary choice of a priori distribution for the ultimate loss. Taking an
information-based approach to the reserving problem, we derive the process of
the conditional distribution of the ultimate loss. The ""best-estimate ultimate
loss process"" is given by the conditional expectation of the ultimate loss. We
derive explicit expressions for the best-estimate ultimate loss process, and
for expected recoveries arising from aggregate excess-of-loss reinsurance
treaties. Use of a deterministic time change allows for the matching of any
initial (increasing) development pattern for the paid claims. We show that
these methods are well-suited to the modelling of claims where there is a
non-trivial probability of catastrophic loss. The generalized inverse-Gaussian
(GIG) distribution is shown to be a natural choice for the a priori ultimate
loss distribution. For particular GIG parameter choices, the best-estimate
ultimate loss process can be written as a rational function of the paid-claims
process. We extend the model to include a second paid-claims process, and allow
the two processes to be dependent. The results obtained can be applied to the
modelling of multiple lines of business or multiple origin years. The
multi-dimensional model has the property that the dimensionality of
calculations remains low, regardless of the number of paid-claims processes. An
algorithm is provided for the simulation of the paid-claims processes.

and on the mean-square-error (MSE) in Bayesian parameter estimation are
proposed. The minima of the h-outage error probability and the MSE are obtained
by the generalized maximum a-posteriori probability and the minimum MSE (MMSE)
estimators, respectively. However, computation of these estimators and their
corresponding performance is usually not tractable and thus, lower bounds on
these terms can be very useful for performance analysis. The proposed class of
lower bounds on the outage error probability is derived using Holder's
inequality. This class is utilized to derive a new class of Bayesian MSE
bounds. It is shown that for unimodal symmetric conditional probability density
functions (pdf) the tightest probability of outage error lower bound in the
proposed class attains the minimum probability of outage error and the tightest
MSE bound coincides with the MMSE performance. In addition, it is shown that
the proposed MSE bounds are always tighter than the Ziv-Zakai lower bound
(ZZLB). The proposed bounds are compared with other existing performance lower
bounds via some examples.

simulations. These complexes are formed when short and flexible polyelectrolyte
chains adsorb onto oppositely charged colloidal spheres, dispersed in an
electrolyte solution. In our simulations the bending energy between adjacent
monomers is small compared to the electrostatic energy, and the chains, once
adsorbed, do not exchange with the solution, although they rearrange on the
particles surface to accomodate further adsorbing chains or due to the
electrostatic interaction with neighbor complexes. Rather unexpectedly, when
two interacting particles approach each others, the rearrangement of the
surface charge distribution invariably produces anti-parallel dipolar doublets,
that invert their orientation at the isoelectric point. These findings clearly
rule out a contribution of dipole-dipole interactions to the observed
attractive interaction between the complexes, pointing out that such
suspensions can not be considered dipolar fluids. On varying the ionic strength
of the electrolyte, we find that a screening length, short compared with the
size of the colloidal particles, is required in order to observe the attraction
between like charged complexes due to the non-uniform distribution of the
electric charge on their surface ('patch attraction'). On the other hand, by
changing the polyelectrolyte/particle charge ratio, the interaction between
like-charged polyelectrolyte-decorated (pd) particles, at short separations,
evolves from purely repulsive to strongly attractive. Hence, the effective
interaction between the complexes is characterized by a potential barrier,
whose height depends on the net charge and on the non-uniformity of their
surface charge distribution.

  A natural and intriguing problem was whether more elements can be added to
the core language, improving its utility, while keeping the growth-rate
properties decidable. In particular, the method presented could not handle a

  The embedding allows to represent every term t of SRN as a family of proof
nets |t|^l in LALL. Every proof net |t|^l in the family simulates t on
arguments whose bit length is bounded by the integer l. The embedding is based
on two crucial features. One is the recursive type in LALL that encodes Scott
binary numerals, i.e. Scott words, as proof nets. Scott words represent the
arguments of t in place of the more standard Church binary numerals. Also, the
embedding exploits the ""fuzzy"" borders of paragraph boxes that LALL inherits
from L4 to ""freely"" duplicate the arguments, especially the safe ones, of t.
Finally, the type of |t|^l depends on the number of composition and recursion
schemes used to define t, namely the structural complexity of t. Moreover, the
size of |t|^l is a polynomial in l, whose degree depends on the structural
complexity of t.

consider probability distributions given in the form of an oracle
$f:[n]\to[m]$. Here the probability $\PP_f(j)$ of an outcome $j\in[m]$ is the
fraction of its domain that $f$ maps to $j$. We give quantum algorithms for
testing whether two such distributions are identical or $\epsilon$-far in
$L_1$-norm. Recently, Bravyi, Hassidim, and Harrow \cite{BHH10} showed that if
$\PP_f$ and $\PP_g$ are both unknown (i.e., given by oracles $f$ and $g$), then
this testing can be done in roughly $\sqrt{m}$ quantum queries to the
functions. We consider the case where the second distribution is known, and
show that testing can be done with roughly $m^{1/3}$ quantum queries, which we
prove to be essentially optimal. In contrast, it is known that classical
testing algorithms need about $m^{2/3}$ queries in the unknown-unknown case and
about $\sqrt{m}$ queries in the known-unknown case. Based on this result, we
also reduce the query complexity of graph isomorphism testers with quantum
oracle access. While those examples provide polynomial quantum speed-ups, our
third example gives a much larger improvement (constant quantum queries vs
polynomial classical queries) for the problem of testing periodicity, based on
Shor's algorithm and a modification of a classical lower bound by Lachish and
Newman \cite{lachish&newman:periodicity}. This provides an alternative to a
recent constant-vs-polynomial speed-up due to Aaronson \cite{aaronson:bqpph}.

become crucial for tasks such as microarray data analysis due to very small
sample sizes resulting in limited empirical evaluation. To the best of our
knowledge, such algorithms that give theoretical bounds on the future
performance have not been proposed so far in the context of the classification

attributes that can be used to perform reliable classification tasks. We apply
the proposed approaches for gene identification from DNA microarray data and

within a deformable periodic simulation box. A superball's interior is defined
by the inequality $|x|^{2q} + |y|^{2q} + |z|^{2q} \leq 1$, which provides a
versatile family of convex particles ($q \geq 0.5$) with cube-like and

octahedron-like shapes. Here, we consider the convex case with a deformation
parameter q between the sphere point (q = 1) and the cube (q = 1). We find that
the asphericity plays a significant role in the extent of cubatic ordering of
both the liquid and crystal phases. Calculation of the first few virial
coefficients shows that superballs that are visually similar to cubes can have
low-density equations of state closer to spheres than to cubes. Dense liquids
of superballs display cubatic orientational order that extends over several
particle lengths only for large q. Along the ordered, high-density equation of
state, superballs with 1 < q < 3 exhibit clear evidence of a phase transition
from a crystal state to a state with reduced long-ranged orientational order

persists until the melting transition. The width of coexistence region between
the liquid and ordered, high-density phase decreases with q up to q = 4.0. The
structures of the high-density phases are examined using certain order
parameters, distribution functions, and orientational correlation functions. We
also find that a fixed simulation cell induces artificial phase transitions
that are out of equilibrium. Current fabrication techniques allow for the
synthesis of colloidal superballs, and thus the phase behavior of such systems

diversity are often predicated on a single newly arisen mutation sweeping
rapidly to fixation. However, a population can also adapt to a new situation by
multiple mutations of similar phenotypic effect that arise in parallel. These
mutations can each quickly reach intermediate frequency, preventing any single
one from rapidly sweeping to fixation globally (a ""soft"" sweep). Here we study
models of parallel mutation in a geographically spread population adapting to a
global selection pressure. The slow geographic spread of a selected allele can
allow other selected alleles to arise and spread elsewhere in the species
range. When these different selected alleles meet, their spread can slow
dramatically, and so form a geographic patchwork which could be mistaken for a
signal of local adaptation. This random spatial tessellation will dissipate
over time due to mixing by migration, leaving a set of partial sweeps within
the global population. We show that the spatial tessellation initially formed
by mutational types is closely connected to Poisson process models of
crystallization, which we extend. We find that the probability of parallel
mutation and the spatial scale on which parallel mutation occurs is captured by
a single characteristic length that reflects the expected distance a spreading
allele travels before it encounters a different spreading allele. This
characteristic length depends on the mutation rate, the dispersal parameter,
the effective local density of individuals, and to a much lesser extent the
strength of selection. We argue that even in widely dispersing species, such
parallel geographic sweeps may be surprisingly common. Thus, we predict, as
more data becomes available, many more examples of intra-species parallel
adaptation will be uncovered.

in G = U(1) x SO(2M) and G = U(1) x USp(2M) theories. The master equations are
solved numerically using appropriate Ansatze for the moduli matrix field. In
the fractional case the vortices are solved in the transverse plane due to the
broken axial symmetry of the configurations (i.e. they are non-rotational
invariant). It is shown that unless the fractional vortex-centers are all
coincident (i.e. local case) the ring-like flux structure, characteristic of
Chern-Simons vortices, will become bell-like fluxes - just as those of the
standard Yang-Mills vortices. The asymptotic profile functions are calculated
in all cases and the effective size is identified.

First, we show that the line-of-sight solution
to cosmic microwave anisotropies in Fourier space, even though formally defined
for arbitrarily large wavelengths, leads to position-space solutions which only
depend on the sources of anisotropies inside the past light-cone of the
observer. This happens order by order in a series expansion in powers of the
visibility $\gamma=e^{-\mu}$, where $\mu$ is the optical depth to Thompson
scattering. We show that the CMB anisotropies are regulated by spacetime window
functions which have support only inside the past light-cone of the point of
observation. Second, we show that the Fourier-Bessel expansion of the physical
fields (including the temperature and polarization momenta) is an alternative
to the usual Fourier basis as a framework to compute the anisotropies. In that
expansion, for each multipole $l$ there is a discrete tower of momenta
$k_{i,l}$ (not a continuum) which can affect physical observables, with the
smallest momenta being $k_{1,l} ~ l$. The Fourier-Bessel modes take into
account precisely the information from the sources of anisotropies that
propagates from the initial value surface to the point of observation - no
more, no less. We also show that the physical observables (the temperature and
polarization maps), and hence the angular power spectra, are unaffected by that
choice of basis. This implies that the Fourier-Bessel expansion is the optimal
scheme with which one can compute CMB anisotropies. (Abridged)

monitoring of the young solar-type star HD171488 (Prot~1.337 d) aimed at
studying surface inhomogeneities at photospheric/chromospheric levels. Echelle
FOCES spectra (R~40000) and Johnson photometry have been performed in 2006.
Spectral type, rotational velocity, metallicity, and gravity were determined
using a code developed by us. The metallicity was measured from the analysis of
iron lines. The spectral subtraction technique was applied to the most relevant
chromospheric diagnostics included in the FOCES spectral range (CaII IRT,
Halpha, HeI-D3, Hbeta, CaII H&K). A model with two large high-latitude spots is
sufficient to reproduce the B/V light curves and the radial velocity
modulation, if a temperature difference between photosphere and spots of 1500 K
is used. A Doppler imaging analysis of photospheric lines confirms a similar
spot distribution. With the help of an analogous geometric two-spot model, we
are able to reproduce the modulations in the residual chromospheric emissions
adopting different values of ratios between the flux of plages and quiet
chromosphere (5 for Halpha and 3 for CaII). Facular regions of solar type
appear to be the main responsible for the modulations of chromospheric
diagnostics. Both the spot/plage model and the cross-correlation between the
light curve and the chromospheric line fluxes display a lead effect of plages
with respect to spots (20-40 deg in longitude). The active regions of the
rapidly rotating star HD171488 are similar to the solar ones in some respect,
because the spot temperature is close to that of sunspot umbrae and the plage
flux-contrast is consistent with the average solar values. The main differences
with respect to the Sun are larger sizes and higher latitudes.
