the exclusive 4-body $B$-meson decay $\bar{B} \to \bar{K}^{*0}\ell^+\ell^-$ in
the low dilepton mass region. The core of the method is the requirement that
the constructed quantities should fulfil the symmetries of the angular
distribution. We have identified all symmetries of the angular distribution in
the limit of massless leptons and explore: a new non-trivial relation between
the coefficients of the angular distribution, the possibility to fully solve
the system for the $K^{*}$ amplitudes, and the construction of non-trivial
observables. We also present a phenomenological analysis of the new physics
sensitivity of angular observables in the decay based on QCD factorisation. We
further analyse the CP-conserving observables, $A_{T}^{(2)}$, $A_{T}^{(3)}$ and
$A_{T}^{(4)}$. They are practically free of theoretical uncertainties due to
the soft form factors for the full range of dilepton masses rather than just at
a single point as for $A_{FB}$. They also have a higher sensitivity to specific
new physics scenarios compared to observables such as $A_{FB}$. Moreover, we
critically examine the new physics reach of CP-violating observables via a
complete error analysis due to scale dependences, form factors and
$\Lambda/m_b$ corrections. We have developed an ensemble method to evaluate the
error on observables from $\Lambda/m_b$ corrections. Finally, we explore the
experimental prospects of CP-violating observables and find that they are
rather limited. Indeed, the CP-conserving (averaged) observables $A_{T}^{(i)}$
(with $i=2,3,4$) will offer a better sensitivity to large CP phases and may be
more suitable for experimental analysis.

Pontryagin--van Kampen duals of \emph{metrizable} abelian groups, or
equivalently, complete abelian groups whose dual is metrizable. By
investigating these connections, we show that also in these cases, the

an abelian metrizable group determine the character of its dual group. Our main
result applies to the more general case of closed subgroups of Pontryagin--van

vertical shears in the atmospheres of short-period jovian exoplanets. Using
linear analysis and nonlinear local simulations, we investigate hydrodynamic
dissipation mechanisms to balance the thermal acceleration of these winds. The
adiabatic Richardson criterion remains a good guide to linear stability,
although thermal diffusion allows some modes to violate it at very long
wavelengths and very low growth rates. Nonlinearly, wind speeds saturate at
Mach numbers $\approx 2$ and Richardson numbers $\lesssim 1/4$ for a broad
range of plausible diffusivities and forcing strengths. Turbulence and vertical
mixing, though accompanied by weak shocks, dominate the dissipation, which
appears to be the outcome of a recurrent Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. An
explicit shear viscosity, as well as thermal diffusivity, is added to ZEUS to
capture dissipation outside of shocks. The wind speed is not monotonic nor
single valued for shear viscosities larger than about $10^{-3}$ of the sound
speed times the pressure scale height. Coarsening the numerical resolution can
also increase the speed. Hence global simulations that are incapable of
representing vertical turbulence and shocks, either because of reduced physics
or because of limited resolution, may overestimate wind speeds. We recommend
that such simulations include artificial dissipation terms to control the Mach
and Richardson numbers and to capture mechanical dissipation as heat.

transition-metal carbides (TMC's) by means of density-functional theory
calculations. Trend studies are conducted with respect to both period and group
in the periodic table, choosing the substrates ScC, TiC, VC, ZrC, NbC,
delta-MoC, TaC, and WC and the adsorbates H, B, C, N, O, F, NH, NH2, and NH3.
Trends in adsorption strength are explained in terms of surface electronic
factors, by correlating the calculated adsorption energy values with the
calculated surface electronic structures. The results are rationalized with use
of a concerted-coupling model (CCM), which has previously been applied
succesfully to the description of adsorption on TiC(111) and TiN(111) surfaces
[Solid State Commun. 141, 48 (2007)]. First, the clean TMC(111) surfaces are
characterized by calculating surface energies, surface relaxations, Bader
charges, and surface-localized densities of states (DOS's). Detailed
comparisons between surface and bulk DOS's reveal the existence of
transition-metal localized SR's (TMSR's) in the pseudogap and of several
C-localized SR's (CSR's) in the upper valence band on all considered TMC(111)
surfaces. Then, atomic and molecular adsorption energies, geometries, and
charge transfers are presented. An analysis of the adsorbate-induced changes in
surface DOS's reveals a presence of both adsorbate--TMSR and adsorbate--CSR's
interactions, of varying strengths depending on the surface and the adsorbate.
These variations are correlated to the variations in adsorption energies. The
results are used to generalize the content and applications of the previously
proposed CCM to this larger class of substrates and adsorbates. Implications
for other classes of materials, for catalysis, and for other surface processes
are discussed.

The spatial distribution of two footpoint X-ray sources is analyzed using

time, the vertical extents and widths of hard X-ray chromospheric sources
measured as a function of energy for a limb event. Our observations suggest
that both the vertical and horizontal sizes of footpoints are decreasing with
energy. Higher energy emission originates progressively deeper in the
chromosphere consistent with downward flare accelerated streaming electrons.
The ellipticity of the footpoints grows with energy from $\sim 0.5$ at $ \sim
20$ keV to $\sim 0.9$ at $\sim 150$ keV. The positions of X-ray emission are in
agreement with an exponential density profile of scale height $\sim 150$~km.
The characteristic size of the hard X-ray footpoint source along the limb is
decreasing with energy suggesting a converging magnetic field in the footpoint.
The vertical sizes of X-ray sources are inconsistent with simple collisional
transport in a single density scale height but can be explained using a
multi-threaded density structure in the chromosphere.

the leaning Pisa tower, the Cambridge apple tree and the Einstein lift. The
perspectives offered by the capture of stars by supermassive black holes are to
be cherished, because the study of the motion of falling stars will constitute
a giant step forward in the understanding of gravitation in the regime of
strong field. After an account on the perception of free fall in ancient times
and on the behaviour of a gravitating mass in Newtonian physics, this chapter
deals with last century debate on the repulsion for a Schwarzschild black hole
and mentions the issue of an infalling particle velocity at the horizon.
Further, black hole perturbations and numerical methods are presented, paving
the way to the introduction of the self-force and other back-action related
methods. The impact of the perturbations on the motion of the falling particle
is computed via the tail, the back-scattered part of the perturbations, or via
a radiative Green function. In the former approach, the self-force acts upon
the background geodesic; in the latter, the geodesic is conceived in the total
(background plus perturbations) field. Regularisation techniques (mode-sum and
Riemann-Hurwitz $z$ function) intervene to cancel divergencies coming from the
infinitesimal size of the particle. An account is given on the state of the
art, including the last results obtained in this most classical problem,
together with a perspective encompassing future space gravitational wave
interferometry and head-on particle physics experiments. As free fall is
patently non-adiabatic, it requires the most sophisticated techniques for
studying the evolution of the motion. In this scenario, the potential of the
self-consistent approach, by means of which the background geodesic is
continuously corrected by the self-force contribution, is examined.

(like the Lanczos-Lovelock action) have certain peculiar features. All of them
can be separated into a bulk and a surface term, with a specific
(""holographic"") relationship between the two, so that either term can be used
to extract information about the other. Further, the surface term leads to
entropy of the horizons on-shell. It has been argued in the past that these
features are impossible to understand in the conventional approach but find a
natural explanation if we consider gravity as an emergent phenomenon. We
provide further support for this point of view in this paper. We describe an
alternative decomposition of the Einstein-Hilbert action and Lanczos-Lovelock
action into a new pair of surface and bulk terms, such that the surface term
becomes Wald entropy on a horizon and the bulk term is the energy density
(which is the ADM Hamiltonian density for Einstein gravity). We show that this
new pair also obeys a holographic relationship and give a thermodynamic
interpretation to this relation in this context. Since the bulk and surface
terms, in this decomposition, are related to energy and entropy, the
holographic condition can be thought of as analogous to inverting the
expression for entropy given as a function of energy S = S(E,V) to obtain the
energy E = E(S,V) in terms of the entropy in a normal thermodynamic system.
Thus the holographic nature of the action allows us to relate the descriptions
of the same system in terms of two different thermodynamic potentials. Some
further possible generalizations and implications are discussed.

eccentric binary system at the onset of Roche lobe overflow (RLO) is a
fundamental assumption common to all binary stellar evolution and population
synthesis codes, even though the validity of this assumption is questionable
both theoretically and observationally. Here we calculate the evolution of the
orbital elements of an eccentric binary through the direct three-body
integration of a massive particle ejected through the inner Lagrangian point of
the donor star at periastron. The trajectory of this particle leads to three
possible outcomes: direct accretion (DA) onto the companion star within a
single orbit, self-accretion (SA) back onto the donor star within a single
orbit, or a quasi-periodic orbit around the companion star. We calculate the
secular evolution of the binary orbit in the first two cases and conclude that
DA can increase or decrease the orbital semi-major axis and eccentricity, while
SA always decreases the orbital both orbital elements. In cases where mass
overflow contributes to circularizing the orbit, circularization can set in on
timescales as short as a few per cent of the mass transfer timescale. In cases
where mass overflow increases the eccentricity, the orbital evolution is
governed by competition between mass overflow and tidal torques. In the absence
of tidal torques, mass overflow resulting in DI can lead to substantially
subsynchronously rotating donor stars. Contrary to common assumptions, DI
furthermore does not always provide a strong sink of orbital angular momentum
in close mass-transferring binaries; in fact we instead find that a significant
part can be returned to the orbit during the particle orbit. The formulation
presented here can be combined with stellar and binary evolution codes to
generate a better picture of the evolution of eccentric, RLO binary star
systems.

magnitudes over our previous WFPC2 results, and find that it continues as a
single power law, dN/dL propto L^alpha with alpha=-2.13+/-0.07, down to the
observational limit of Mv~-7. Similarly, the mass function is a single power
law dN/dM propto M^beta with beta=-2.10+/-0.20 for clusters with ages t<3x10^8
yr, corresponding to lower mass limits that range from 10^4 to 10^5 Msun,
depending on the age range of the subsample. Hence the power law indices for
the luminosity and mass functions are essentially the same. The luminosity
function for intermediate-age clusters (i.e., ~100-300 Myr old objects found in
the loops, tails, and outer areas) shows no bend or turnover down to Mv~-6,
consistent with relaxation-driven cluster disruption models which predict the
turnover should not be observed until Mv~-4. An analysis of individual ~0.5-kpc
sized areas over diverse environments shows good agreement between values of
alpha and beta, similar to the results for the total population of clusters in

somewhat older clusters appearing to have triggered the formation of younger
clusters. The area around Knot B is a particularly interesting example, with an
~10-50 Myr old cluster of estimated mass ~10^6 Msun having apparently triggered
the formation of several younger, more massive (up to 5x10^6 Msun) clusters

by an average factor of $\sim$5 when SED fitting with 24~$\micron$ photometry

high- and low-mass star-forming regions at abundances which cannot be explained
by any known gas-phase chemistry. Recent laboratory experiments show that UV
irradiation of CH3OH-rich ices may be an important mechanism for producing
complex molecules and releasing them into the gas-phase. To test this ice
formation scenario we mapped the B1-b dust core and nearby protostar in CH3OH
gas using the IRAM 30m telescope to identify locations of efficient non-thermal
ice desorption. We find three CH3OH abundance peaks tracing two outflows and a
quiescent region on the side of the core facing the protostar. The CH3OH gas
has a rotational temperature of ~10 K at all locations. The quiescent CH3OH
abundance peak and one outflow position were searched for complex molecules.
Narrow, 0.6-0.8 km s-1 wide, HCOOCH3 and CH3CHO lines originating in cold gas
are clearly detected, CH3OCH3 is tentatively detected and C2H5OH and HOCH2CHO
are undetected toward the quiescent core, while no complex molecular lines were
found toward the outflow. The core abundances with respect to CH3OH are ~2.3%
and 1.1% for HCOOCH3 and CH3CHO, respectively, and the upper limits are
0.7-1.1%, which is similar to most other low-mass sources. The observed complex
molecule characteristics toward B1-b and the pre-dominance of HCO-bearing
species suggest a cold ice (below 25 K, the sublimation temperature of CO)
formation pathway followed by non-thermal desorption through e.g. UV photons
traveling through outflow cavities. The observed complex gas composition
together with the lack of any evidence of warm gas-phase chemistry provide
clear evidence of efficient complex molecule formation in cold interstellar

which seeks to understand how the difficulty of computing a function on each of
k independent inputs scales with k. We prove the following direct product
theorem (DPT) for query complexity: if every T-query algorithm has success
probability at most 1 - eps in computing the Boolean function f on input
distribution Mu, then for alpha <= 1, every (alpha eps Tk)-query algorithm has
success probability at most (2^{alpha eps}(1 - eps))^k in computing the k-fold
direct product f^k correctly on k independent inputs from Mu. In light of
examples due to Shaltiel, this statement gives an essentially optimal tradeoff
between the query bound and the error probability. As a corollary, we show that
for an absolute constant alpha > 0, the worst-case success probability of any
(alpha R_2(f)k)-query randomized algorithm for f^k falls exponentially with k.
The best previous statement of this type, due to Klauck, Spalek, and de Wolf,
required a query bound of O(bs(f)k). The proof involves defining and analyzing
a collection of martingales associated with an algorithm attempting to solve
f^k. Our method is quite general and yields a new XOR lemma and threshold DPT
for the query model, as well as DPTs for the query complexity of learning
tasks, search problems, and tasks involving interaction with dyamic entities.
We also give a version of our DPT in which decision tree size is the resource

$p_T>5$ GeV/$c$ in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm nn}}=200$ GeV has been a
longstanding challenge for jet quenching models based on perturbative QCD
(pQCD). Using a simple jet absorption model, we seek to clarify the situation
by exploring in detail how the calculated $v_2$ varies with choices of the
collision geometry as well as choices of the path length dependence and
thermalization time $\tau_0$ in the energy loss formula. Besides the change of
eccentricity due to distortion from gluon saturation or event-by-event
fluctuation, we find that the $v_2$ is also sensitive to the centrality
dependence of multiplicity and the relative size between the matter profile and
the jet profile. We find that the $v_2$ calculated for the naive quadratic path
length dependence of energy loss, even including eccentricity fluctuation and
the gluon saturation, is not enough to describe the experimental data at high
$p_T$ ($\sim$ 6 GeV/$c$) in Au+Au collisions. However, it can match the full
centrality dependence of $v_2$ data if higher power path length dependence of
energy loss is allowed. We also find that the calculated $v_2$ is sensitive to
the assumption of the early time dynamics but generally increases with
$\tau_0$, opposite to what one expects for elliptic flow. This study attests to
the importance of confining the initial geometry, possibly by combining jet
quenching $v_2$ with elliptic flow and other jet quenching observables, for
proper interpretation of the experimental data.

can be said to be the oldest unsolved problem in science, as it started with
Kohlrausch in 1847. Many electrical and optical phenomena exhibit SER with
probe relaxation I(t) ~ exp[-(t/{\tau}){\beta}], with 0 < {\beta} < 1. Here
{\tau} is a material-sensitive parameter, useful for discussing chemical
trends. The ""shape"" parameter {\beta} is dimensionless and plays the role of a
non-equilibrium scaling exponent; its value, especially in glasses, is both
practically useful and theoretically significant. The mathematical complexity
of SER is such that rigorous derivations of this peculiar function were not
achieved until the 1970's. The focus of much of the 1970's pioneering work was
spatial relaxation of electronic charge, but SER is a universal phenomenon, and
today atomic and molecular relaxation of glasses and deeply supercooled liquids
provide the most reliable data. As the data base grew, the need for a
quantitative theory increased; this need was finally met by the
diffusion-to-traps topological model, which yields a remarkably simple
expression for the shape parameter {\beta}, given by d*/(d* + 2). At first
sight this expression appears to be identical to d/(d + 2), where d is the
actual spatial dimensionality, as originally derived. The original model,
however, failed to explain much of the data base. Here the theme of earlier
reviews, based on the observation that in the presence of short-range forces
only d* = d = 3 is the actual spatial dimensionality, while for mixed short-
and long-range forces, d* = fd = d/2, is applied to four new spectacular
examples, where it turns out that SER is useful not only for purposes of
quality control, but also for defining what is meant by a glass in novel
contexts. (Please see full abstract in main text)

preserve an integrability constraint, which yields a single non-linear
differential equation for the ac-field. A solution to this equation is
expressed in terms of Jacobi elliptic functions with three independent
parameters that allows one to choose the frequency, average value, and
amplitude of the time-dependent field at will. This form of the ac-drive is
especially relevant to the problem of dynamics of TLS charge defects that cause
dielectric losses in superconducting qubits. We apply our exact results to
analyze non-linear dielectric response of such TLSs and show that the position
of the resonance peak in the spectrum of the relevant correlation function is
determined by the quantum-mechanical phase accumulated by the TLS wave-function
over a time evolution cycle. It is shown that in the non-linear regime, this
resonance frequency may be shifted strongly from the value predicted by the
canonical TLS model. We also analyze the ""spin"" survival probability in the
regime of strong external drive and recover a coherent destruction of tunneling

  Implicit Computational Complexity aims at studying computational complexity
without referring to external measuring conditions or particular machine
models, but instead by considering restrictions on programming languages or
logical principles implying complexity properties. The aim of this workshop was
to bring together researchers working on implicit computational complexity,
from its logical and semantical aspects to those related to the static analysis
of programs, so as to foster their interaction and to give newcomers an
overview of the current trends in this area.

body physics, as experimental systems are widely controllable, both statically
and dynamically. One such system is the one-dimensional (1D) Bose gas on a
ring. In this system binary contact interactions between the constituent
bosonic atoms, usually alkali metals, can be controlled in both sign and
magnitude; a recent experiment has tuned interactions over seven orders of
magnitude, using an atom-molecule resonance called a Feshbach resonance. Thus
one can directly realize the Lieb-Liniger Hamiltonian, from the weakly- to the
strongly-interacting regime. At the same time there are a number of experiments
utilizing ring traps. The ring geometry affords us the opportunity to study
topological properties of this system as well; one of the main properties of a
superfluid is the quantized circulation in which the average angular momentum
per particle, L/N, is quantized under rotation. Thus we focus on a tunable 1D
Bose system for which the main control parameters are interaction and rotation.
We will show that there is a critical boundary in the interaction-rotation
control-parameter plane over which the topological properties of the system
change. This is the basis of our concept of \textit{metastable quantum phase
transitions} (QPTs). Moreover, we will show that the finite domain of the ring
is necessary for the QPT to occur at all because the zero-point kinetic
pressure can induce QPTs, i.e., the system must be finite; we thus seek to
generalize the concept of QPTs to inherently finite, mesoscopic or nanoscopic
systems.""

well-established research direction. However, prior work shows that this
approach to pairing can be prone to human errors of different forms that may
directly or indirectly translate into man-in-the-middle attacks. To address
this problem, we propose a general direction of the use of computer games for
pairing. Since games are a popular means of entertainment, our hypothesis is
that they may serve as an incentive to users and make the pairing process
enjoyable for them, thus improving the usability, as well as the security, of
the pairing process. We consider an emerging use case of pairing whereby two
different users are involved, each in possession of his or her own device
(e.g., Alice and Bob pairing their smartphones for social interactions). We
develop ""Alice Says,"" a pairing game based on a popular memory game called
Simon (Says), and discuss the underlying design challenges. We also present a
preliminary evaluation of Alice Says via a usability study and demonstrate its
feasibility in terms of usability and security. Our results indicate that
overall Alice Says was deemed as a fun and an enjoyable way to pair devices,
confirming our hypothesis. However, contrary to our intuition, the relatively
slower speed of Alice Says pairing was found to be a cause of concern and
prompts the need for the design of faster pairing games. We put forth several
ways in which this issue can be ameliorated. In addition, we also discuss
several other security problems which are lacking optimal solutions and suggest
ideas on how entertainment can be used to improve the current state of the art
solutions that have been developed to address them.

starburst galaxies, most of them classified as Wolf-Rayet galaxies. In this
paper, the last of the series, we analyze the global properties of our galaxy
sample using multiwavelength data (X-ray, FUV, optical, NIR, FIR, and radio).
The agreement between our Ha-based SFR and those provided by indicators at
other wavelengths is remarkable, but we consider that the new Ha-based
calibration provided by Calzetti et al. (2007) should be preferred over older
calibrations. The FUV-based SFR provides a powerful tool to analyze the
star-formation activity in both global and local scales independently to the Ha
emission. We provide empirical relationships between the ionized gas mass,
neutral gas mass, dust mass, stellar mass, and dynamical mass with the
B-luminosity. Although all mass estimations increase with increasing
luminosity, we find important deviations to the general trend in some objects,
that seem to be consequence of their particular evolutionary histories. We
investigate the mass-metallicity relations and conclude that both the nature
and the star-formation history are needed to understand the relationships
between both properties. The majority of the galaxies follow a
Schmidt-Kennicutt scaling law of star-formation that agrees with that reported
in individual star-forming regions within M~51 but not with that found in
normal spiral galaxies. We found a relation between the reddening coefficient
and the warm dust mass indicating that the extinction is mainly internal to the
galaxies. Considering all data, we found that 17 up to 20 galaxies are clearly
interacting or merging with low-luminosity dwarf objects or HI clouds. We
conclude that interactions do play a fundamental role in the triggering
mechanism of the strong star-formation activity observed in dwarf starburst
galaxies.

distribution, named Benford's law. We investigate three kinds of widely used
physical statistics, i.e., the Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) distribution, the
Fermi-Dirac (FD) distribution, and the Bose-Einstein (BE) distribution, and
find that the BG and FD distributions both fluctuate slightly in a periodic
manner around the Benford distribution with respect to the temperature of the
system, while the BE distribution conforms to it exactly whatever the
temperature is. Thus the Benford's law seems to present a general pattern for
physical statistics and might be even more fundamental and profound in nature.
Furthermore, various elegant properties of Benford's law, especially the
mantissa distribution of data sets, are discussed.

certain profinite l-adic group algebra in terms of an equivariant Artin
L-function. This is a refinement of earlier work of Deligne and Tate on Picard
1-motives associated to global function fields. As a consequence, we prove
refined versions of the Brumer-Stark and the (\'etale) Coates-Sinnott

mathematics used to describe the physical world. We start by reviewing many of
the assumptions underlying the concepts of real, physical, rigid bodies and the
translational and rotational properties of such rigid bodies. Nearly all
elementary and advanced texts make physical assumptions that are subtly
different from ours, and as a result we develop a mathematical description that
is subtly different from the standard mathematical structure. Using the
homogeneity and isotropy of space, we investigate the translational and
rotational features of rigid bodies in two and three dimensions. We find that
the concept of rigid bodies and the concept of the homogeneity of space are
intrinsically linked. The geometric study of rotations of rigid objects leads
to a geometric product relationship for lines and vectors. By requiring this
product to be both associative and to satisfy Pythagoras' theorem, we obtain a
choice of Clifford algebras. We extend our arguments from space to include
time. By assuming that ct=l and rewriting this in Lorentz invariant form as
c^2t^2-x^2-y^2-z^2=0 we obtain a generalization of Pythagoras to spacetime.
This leads us directly to establishing that the Clifford algebra CL(1,3) is an
appropriate mathematical structure to describe spacetime. Clifford algebras are
not division algebras. We show that the existence of non-invertible elements in
the algebra is not a limitation of the usefulness to physics of the algebra but
rather that it reflects accurately the spacetime properties of physical
systems.

quasars by stars and stellar remnants in the Milky Way. We present predictions
for the all-sky microlensing optical depth, time-scale distributions and event
rates for future large-area sky surveys. As expected, the total event rate
increases rapidly with increasing magnitude limit, reflecting the fact that the
number density of quasars is a steep function of magnitude. Surveys such as
Pan-STARRS and LSST should be able to detect more than ten events per year,
with typical event durations of around one month. Since microlensing of quasar
sources suffers from fewer degeneracies than lensing of Milky Way sources, they
could be used as a powerful tool for recovering the mass of the lensing object
in a robust, often model-independent, manner. As a consequence, for a subset of
these events it will be possible to directly `weigh' the star (or stellar
remnant) that is causing the lensing signal, either through higher order
microlensing effects and/or high-precision astrometric observations of the lens
star (using, for example, Gaia or SIM-lite). This means that such events could
play a crucial role in stellar astronomy. Given the current operational
timelines for Pan-STARRS and LSST, by the end of the decade they could
potentially detect up to 100 events. Although this is still too few events to
place detailed constraints on Galactic models, consistency checks can be
carried out and such samples could lead to exciting and unexpected discoveries.

unified field theory are known as the Rainich conditions. Penrose and more
recently Bergqvist and Lankinen made an analogy from the Ricci tensor to the
Bel-Robinson tensor $B_{\alpha\beta\mu\nu}$, a certain fourth rank tensor
quadratic in the Weyl curvature, which also satisfies algebraic Rainich-like
conditions. However, we found that not only does the tensor
$B_{\alpha\beta\mu\nu}$ fulfill these conditions, but so also does our recently
proposed tensor $V_{\alpha\beta\mu\nu}$, which has many of the desirable
properties of $B_{\alpha\beta\mu\nu}$. For the quasilocal small sphere limit
restriction, we found that there are only two fourth rank tensors
$B_{\alpha\beta\mu\nu}$ and $V_{\alpha\beta\mu\nu}$ which form a basis for good
energy expressions. Both of them have the completely trace free and causal
properties, these two form necessary and sufficient conditions. Surprisingly
either completely traceless or causal is enough to fulfill the algebraic
Rainich conditions. Furthermore, relaxing the quasilocal restriction and
considering the general fourth rank tensor, we found two remarkable results:
(i) without any symmetry requirement, the algebraic Rainich conditions only
require totally trace free; (ii) with a symmetry requirement, we recovered the
same result as in the quasilocal small sphere limit.

dynamics of vehicle traffic flow and traffic congestion by interpreting traffic

many undesired phenomena, e.g., traffic jams. It also reflects the apparent
helplessness of drivers in traffic, who feel like passive particles that are
pushed around by exterior forces; one of the crucial aspects is the inability
to communicate and coordinate with other traffic participants. We present
distributed methods for solving these fundamental problems, employing modern
wireless, ad-hoc, multi-hop networks. The underlying idea is to use these
capabilities as the basis for self-organizing methods for coordinating data
collection and processing, recognizing traffic phenomena, and changing their
structure by coordinated behavior. The overall objective is a multi-level
approach that reaches from protocols for local wireless communication, data
dissemination, pattern recognition, over hierarchical structuring and
coordinated behavior, all the way to large-scale traffic regulation. In this
article we describe three types of results: (i) self-organizing and distributed
methods for maintaining and collecting data (using our concept of Hovering Data
Clouds); (ii) adaptive data dissemination for traffic information systems;
(iii) methods for self-recognition of traffic jams. We conclude by describing
higher-level aspects of our work.

wireless and optical communication systems under very general settings for the
user symbols and the signature matrix entries. The channel is modeled with
real/complex additive noise of arbitrary distribution. Two problems are
addressed. The first problem concerns whether overloaded error free codes exist
in the absence of additive noise under these general settings, and if so
whether there are any practical optimum decoding algorithms. The second one is
about the bounds for the sum channel capacity when user data and signature
codes employ any real or complex alphabets (finite or infinite). In response to
the first problem, we have developed practical Maximum Likelihood (ML) decoding
algorithms for overloaded CDMA systems for a large class of alphabets. In
response to the second problem, a general theorem has been developed in which
the sum capacity lower bounds with respect to the number of users and spreading
gain and Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) can be derived as special cases for a
given CDMA system. To show the power and utility of the main theorem, a number
of sum capacity bounds for special cases are simulated. An important conclusion
of this paper is that the lower and upper bounds of the sum capacity for
small/medium size CDMA systems depend on both the input and the signature
symbols; this is contrary to the asymptotic results for large scale systems
reported in the literature (also confirmed in this paper) where the signature
symbols and statistics disappear in the asymptotic sum capacity. Moreover,
these questions are investigated for the case when not all users are active.
Furthermore, upper and asymptotic bounds are derived and numerically evaluated
and compared to other derivations.

long-sought Rosetta Stone needed to decipher the nature of pulsar radio
emission has been finally identified as the double features in averaged pulsar
profiles. The authors argue that highly symmetric bifurcated features are
produced by a split-fan beams of extraordinary-mode curvature radiation emitted
by thin microscopic streams of magnetospheric plasma conducted by a very narrow
bundle of magnetic field lines. We examined arguments leading to these
intriguing conclusions and found a number of flaws. At least one of them is
fatal, namely there is not enough available energy within such thin microscopic
plasma streams. Using an elementary pulsar physics we show that if the stream
is so thin that its emission can reveal the signatures of elementary radiation
mechanism, then the energy deficit tends to be severe and reaches a few to
several orders of magnitude (depending on the actual efficiency of converting
the available kinetic energy of relativistic charged particles into the
coherent radio emission). We are certain that the answer to the question
contained in the title of this paper is definitely negative.

to critical events such as emergencies and crises. If a critical event occurs
to a user, the user needs to send critical traffic as early as possible.
However, most existing medium access control (MAC) protocols are not adequate
to meet the urgent need for data transmission by users with critical traffic.
In this paper, we devise a class of distributed MAC protocols that achieve
coordination using the finite-length memory of users containing their own
observations and traffic types. We formulate a protocol design problem and find
optimal protocols that solve the problem. We show that the proposed protocols
enable a user with critical traffic to transmit its critical traffic without
interruption from other users after a short delay while allowing users to share
the channel efficiently when there is no critical traffic. Moreover, the
proposed protocols require short memory and can be implemented without explicit
message passing.

for analyzing EMG-data called ""intensity analysis"" (EMG = electromyography).
Basically the method is a sort of bandpassing of the signal. The central idea
of the method is to describe the ""power"" (or ""intensity"") of a non-stationary
EMG signal as a function both of time and of frequency. The connection with
wavelet theory is that the filter is constructed by rescaling a given mother
wavelet using a special array of scales (center frequencies) with non-constant
relative bandwidth. Some aspects of the method may seem a bit ad hoc and we
have therefore undertaken a closer mathematical investigation, showing the
connection with the conventional wavelet analysis and giving a somewhat
simplified formulation of the method using Morlet wavelets. It is pointed out
that the ""intensity analysis"" method is related to the concept of an equalizer.
In order to illustrate the method we apply it to nonstationary EMG-signals of a
dynamic leg-extension force-velcity tests. (Data provided by Taija Finni,

the SiO and the high-velocity CO. The jet consists of a chain of emission knots
with an inter-knot spacing of ~2"" (500 AU) and a semi-periodic velocity
variation. The innermost pair of knots, which are significant in the SiO map
but barely seen in the CO, are located at ~1"" (250 AU) from the central source,
L1448C(N). Since the dynamical time scale for the innermost pair is only ~10
yr, SiO may have been formed in the protostellar wind through the gas-phase
reaction, or been formed on the dust grain and directly released into the gas
phase by means of shocks. It is found that the jet is extremely active with a
mechanical luminosity of ~7 L_sun, which is comparable to the bolometric
luminosity of the central source (7.5 L_sun). The mass accretion rate onto the
protostar derived from the mass-loss rate is ~10^{-5} M_sun/yr. Such a high
mass accretion rate suggests that the mass and the age of the central star are
0.03-0.09 M_sun and (4-12)x10^3 yr, respectively, implying that the central
star is in the very early stage of protostellar evolution. The low-velocity CO

scale, resource limitations, and new threats such as node capture necessitate
the use of an on-line key generation by the nodes themselves. However, the cost
of such schemes is high since their secrecy is based on computational
complexity. Recently, several research contributions justified that the
wireless channel itself can be used to generate information-theoretic secure
keys. By exchanging sampling messages during movement, a bit string can be
derived that is only known to the involved entities. Yet, movement is not the
only possibility to generate randomness. The channel response is also strongly
dependent on the frequency of the transmitted signal. In our work, we introduce
a protocol for key generation based on the frequency-selectivity of channel
fading. The practical advantage of this approach is that we do not require node
movement. Thus, the frequent case of a sensor network with static motes is
supported. Furthermore, the error correction property of the protocol mitigates
the effects of measurement errors and other temporal effects, giving rise to an
agreement rate of over 97%. We show the applicability of our protocol by
implementing it on MICAz motes, and evaluate its robustness and secrecy through
experiments and analysis.

radial profiles of covariant scalars in regular Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi dust
models. We consider specifically the phenomenon of ""profile inversions"" in
which an initial clump profile of density, spatial curvature or the expansion
scalar, might evolve into a void profile (and vice versa). Previous work in the
literature on models with density void profiles and/or allowing for density
profile inversions is given full generalization, with some erroneous results
corrected. We prove rigorously that if an evolution without shell crossings is
assumed, then only the 'clump to void' inversion can occur in density profiles,
and only in hyperbolic models or regions with negative spatial curvature. The
profiles of spatial curvature follow similar patterns as those of the density,
with 'clump to void' inversions only possible for hyperbolic models or regions.
However, profiles of the expansion scalar are less restrictive, with profile
inversions necessarily taking place in elliptic models. We also examine radial
profiles in special LTB configurations: closed elliptic models, models with a
simultaneous big bang singularity, as well as a locally collapsing elliptic
region surrounded by an expanding hyperbolic background. The general analytic
statements that we obtain allow for setting up the right initial conditions to
construct fully regular LTB models with any specific qualitative requirements
for the profiles of all scalars and their time evolution. The results presented
can be very useful in guiding future numerical work on these models and in
revising previous analytic work on all their applications.

study on the capillarity-driven invasion dynamics of liquids in networks of
pores a few nanometers across in monolithic, nanoporous silica glass (porous

investigated along with a variation of the humidity and the temperature upon
spontaneous imbibition allows us to gain information regarding the fluidity and
capillarity of liquids in such nanoporous environments. We observe square-root
of time imbibition dynamics for all liquids applied, which we can
quantitatively describe by both a conserved bulk fluidity in the pore center
and bulk capillarity at the advancing menisci, if we assume a sticky boundary
layer (negative velocity slip length). Moreover, pecularities of
nanopore-confined liquids, such as transport via the vapor phase leading to
preadsorbed liquid layers, have to be properly accounted for. Upon increasing
the chain-length in the case of the n-alkanes, we found hints towards a
transition from stick- to slip-flow at the pore walls with increasing
chain-length and thus polymeric behavior. Meniscus freezing is reported for

orbiting around a Wolf-Rayet star. It has been detected at radio frequencies
and up to high-energy gamma rays (above 100 MeV). However, many models also
predict a very high energy (VHE) emission (above hundreds of GeV) when the
source displays relativistic persistent jets or transient ejections. Therefore,
detecting such emission would improve the understanding of the jet physics. The
imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope MAGIC observed Cygnus X-3 for about 70
hours between 2006 March and 2009 August in different X-ray/radio spectral
states and also during a period of enhanced gamma-ray emission. MAGIC found no
evidence for a VHE signal from the direction of the microquasar. An upper limit
to the integral flux for energies higher than 250 GeV has been set to 2.2 x
10-12 photons cm-2 s-1 (95% confidence level). This is the best limit so far to
the VHE emission from this source. The non-detection of a VHE signal during the
period of activity in the high-energy band sheds light on the location of the
possible VHE radiation favoring the emission from the innermost region of the
jets, where absorption is significant. The current and future generations of
Cherenkov telescopes may detect a signal under precise spectral conditions.

initial data sets which are, in a sense, asymptotically Schwarzschildean. As a
preliminary step to the construction of the geometric invariant, an analysis of

performed, to obtain a set of three conditions ensuring the existence of a
Killing spinor of the development of the initial data set. In order to
construct the geometric invariant, we introduce the notion of approximate
Killing spinors. These spinors are symmetric valence 2 spinors intrinsic to the
initial hypersurface and satisfy a certain second order elliptic equation
---the approximate Killing spinor equation. This equation arises as the
Euler-Lagrange equation of a non-negative integral functional. This functional
constitutes part of our geometric invariant ---however, the whole functional
does not come from a variational principle. The asymptotic behaviour of
solutions to the approximate Killing spinor equation is studied and an
existence theorem is presented.

decreases from the state in the center of a regular island to the outermost
state by orders of magnitude, while chaotic states have almost equal
probabilities. We derive an analytical expression for the occupations of
regular states of kicked systems, which depends on the winding numbers of the
regular tori and the parameters temperature and driving frequency. For a
constant winding number within a regular island it simplifies to Boltzmann-like
weights $\exp(-\betaeff \Ereg_m)$, similar to time-independent systems. For
this we introduce the regular energies $\Ereg_m$ of the quantizing tori and an
effective winding-number-dependent temperature $1/\betaeff$, different from the
actual bath temperature. Furthermore, the occupations of other typical Floquet
states in a mixed phase space are studied, i.e. regular states on nonlinear

in the process of semi-inclusive bottom-Higgs production at LHC in the MSSM.
The size of the electroweak contribution depends on the choice of the final
produced neutral Higgs boson, and can be relevant, in some range of the input
parameters. A comparison of the one-loop results obtained in two different
renormalization schemes is also performed, showing a very good NLO scheme
independence. We further comment on two possible, simpler, approximations of
the full NLO result, and on their reliabilty.

space-time. In particular, we provide a codimension 2 isometric embedding which
naturally gives rise to the previously introduced global coordinates.
Furthermore, we study the causal structure by probing the space-time with point
particles as well as with scalar fields. We show that, even though there is no
global time function in the technical sense (Schroedinger space-time being
non-distinguishing), the time coordinate of the global Schroedinger coordinate
system is, in a precise way, the closest one can get to having such a time
function. In spite of this and the corresponding strongly Galilean and almost
pathological causal structure of this space-time, it is nevertheless possible
to define a Hilbert space of normalisable scalar modes with a well-defined
time-evolution. We also discuss how the Galilean causal structure is reflected
and encoded in the scalar Wightman functions and the bulk-to-bulk propagator.

The property of the allowed parameter space is similar for MSSM and NMSSM, but
quite different for nMSSM; (iii) The future SuperCDMS can cover most part of

Four pertinent model parameters, characterizing the coupling strengths and
screening, are adjusted to reproduce the color-average heavy-quark free energy

spectroscopy in the open (D, B) and hidden (Psi and Upsilon) flavor sectors, as
well as in the high-energy limit of elastic perturbative QCD scattering.

proximity (median distance ~35 pc). We wrote a modeling procedure to generate
hypothetical companions of given mass, age, eccentricity, and semi-major axis,
and place them around BPMG members that fall within the V-band range of the
GPI. We count as possible detections companions lying within the GPI's field of
view and H-band fluxes that have a host-companion flux ratio placing them
within its sensitivity. The fraction of companions that could be detected
depends on their brightness at 12 Myr, and hence formation mechanism, and on
their distribution of semi-major axes. We used brightness models for formation
by disk instability and core-accretion. We considered the two extreme cases of
the semi-major axis distribution - the log-normal distribution of the nearby F
and G type stars and a power-law distribution indicated by the exoplanets
detected by the radial velocity technique. We find that the GPI could detect
exoplanets of all the F and G spectral type stars in the BPMG sample with a
probability that depends on the brightness model and semi-major axis
distribution. At spectral type K to M1, exoplanet detectability depends on
brightness and hence distance of the host star. GPI will be able to detect the
companions of M stars later than M1 only if they are closer than 10 pc. Of the
four A stars in BPMG sample, only one has V-band brightness in the range of

0.9Tc and latent heat is released or generated at the interface upon
evaporation or condensation (with Tc being the critical temperature). In the
scheme of the dynamic van der Waals theory, the hydrodynamic equations
containing the gradient stress are solved in the axisymmetric geometry. We
assume that the substrate has a finite thickness and its temperature obeys the
thermal diffusion equation. A precursor film then spreads ahead of the bulk
droplet itself in the complete wetting condition. Cooling the substrate
enhances condensation of gas onto the advancing film, which mostly takes place
near the film edge and can be the dominant mechanism of the film growth in a
late stage. The generated latent heat produces a temperature peak or a hot spot
in the gas region near the film edge. On the other hand, heating the substrate
induces evaporation all over the interface. For weak heating, a steady-state
circular thin film can be formed on the substrate. For stronger heating,
evaporation dominates over condensation, leading to eventual disappearance of
the liquid region.
