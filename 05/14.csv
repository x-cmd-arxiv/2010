dust grains have been detected and are known as transitional disks. Recently,
Spitzer has identified a new class of ""pre-transitional disks"" with gaps; these
objects have an optically thick inner disk separated from an optically thick
outer disk by an optically thin disk gap. A near-infrared spectrum provided the
first confirmation of a gap in the pre-transitional disk of LkCa 15 by
verifying that the near-infrared excess emission in this object was due to an
optically thick inner disk. Here we investigate the difference between the
nature of the inner regions of transitional and pre-transitional disks using
the same veiling-based technique to extract the near-infrared excess emission
above the stellar photosphere. We show that the near-infrared excess emission
of the previously identified pre-transitional disks of LkCa 15 and UX Tau A in
Taurus as well as the newly identified pre-transitional disk of ROX 44 in
Ophiuchus can be fit with an inner disk wall located at the dust destruction
radius. We also model the broad-band SEDs of these objects, taking into account
the effect of shadowing by the inner disk on the outer disk, considering the
finite size of the star. The near-infrared excess continua of these three
pre-transitional disks, which can be explained by optically thick inner disks,
are significantly different from that of the transitional disks of GM Aur,
whose near-infrared excess continuum can be reproduced by emission from
sub-micron-sized optically thin dust, and DM Tau, whose near-infrared spectrum
is consistent with a disk hole that is relatively free of small dust. The
structure of pre-transitional disks may be a sign of young planets forming in
these disks and future studies of pre-transitional disks will provide
constraints to aid in theoretical modeling of planet formation.

inequalities between graph homomorphism densities. In the language of quantum

graph that can be represented as a sum of squares of labeled quantum graphs is
necessarily positive. Lov\'asz asks whether the opposite is also true. We
answer this question and also a related question of Razborov in the negative by
introducing explicit valid inequalities that do not satisfy the required

  It is known that the problem of determining whether a multivariate polynomial
is positive is decidable. Hence it is very natural to ask ""Is the problem of
determining the validity of a linear inequality between homomorphism densities

inequalities are inherently difficult in their full generality. Furthermore we
deduce from this fact that the analogue of Artin's solution to Hilbert's

Lagrangian forms are described. Covariant constraint equations that place
restrictions on field components are presented. With G = SU(2), a detail
application to the electroweak model is discussed. We first show that the

right-handed neutrino fields. One vanishes at the point where we obtain a
massless (photon) field and the second one has no interaction. This provides a
clear explanation why weak interactions do not involve right-handed neutrinos,
while permitting neutrinos with mass. This model also indicates a different
region of matter involving coupled leptons that are ""blind"" to the massless
electromagnetic field but ""see"" four massive potentials that are themselves
blind to the electromagnetic field. We argue that these more difficult to

  figures",,"10.1086/658243",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We examine the scientific viability of an imaging mission to find exo-Earths
combining the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) with a starshade external
occulter under a realistic set of astrophysical assumptions. We define an
exo-Earth as a planet of 1 to 10 Earth masses orbiting in the habitable zone
(HZ) of a solar-type star. We show that for a survey strategy that relies on a
single image to detect an exo-Earth, roughly half of all exo-Earth detections
will be false alarms. Here, a false alarm is a mistaken identification of a
planet as an exo-Earth. We consider two survey strategies designed to mitigate
the false alarm problem. The first is to require that for each potential
exo-Earth, a sufficient number of detections are made to measure the orbit.
When the orbit is known we can determine if the planet is in the habitable
zone. With this strategy, we find that the number of exo-Earths found is on
average 0.9, 1.9 and 2.7 for {\eta}_Earth = 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3. Here,
{\eta}_Earth is the frequency of exo-Earths orbiting solar-type stars. There is
a ~40% probability of finding zero exo-Earths for {\eta}_Earth = 0.1. A second
strategy can be employed if a space astrometry mission has identified and
measured the orbits and masses of the planets orbiting nearby stars. We find
that with prior space-based astrometry from a survey of 60 nearby stars, JWST
plus an external occulter can obtain orbital solutions for the majority (70% to
80%) of the exo-Earths orbiting these 60 stars. The exo-Earth yield is
approximately five times higher than the yield for the JWST plus occulter
mission without prior astrometry. With prior astrometry, the probability that
an imaging mission will find zero exo-Earths is reduced to below 1% for the
case of {\eta}_Earth = 0.1.

polytrope and referred hereafter to as a planet) under the assumption of a
spherically symmetric structure. The eigenfrequencies, spatial form of the
associated eigenfunctions and other properties we obtained analytically using
the WKBJ eigenfunctions are in good agreement with corresponding results
obtained by numerical means for a variety of planet models even for global
modes with a large scale distribution of perturbed quantities. This indicates
that even though they are embedded in a dense spectrum, such modes can be
identified and followed as model parameters changed and that first order
perturbation theory can be applied. This is used to estimate corrections to the
eigenfrequencies as a consequence of the anelastic approximation, which we
argue here to be small when the rotation frequency is small. These are compared
with simulation results in an accompanying paper with a good agreement between
theoretical and numerical results. The results reported here may provide a
basis of theoretical investigations of inertial waves in many astrophysical and
other applications, where a rotating body can be modelled as a uniformly
rotating barotropic object, for which the density has, close to its surface, an
approximately power law dependence on distance from the surface.

of Ivanov & Papaloizou to consider planet models with solid cores and to avoid
making an anelastic approximation. We obtain a power spectrum of the tidal
response of coreless models which enables global inertial modes to be
identified. Their frequencies are found to be in good agreement with those
obtained using either a WKBJ approach or the anelastic spectral approach
adopted in previous work for small planet rotation rates. We also find that the
dependence of the normal mode frequencies on the planet angular velocity in
case of higher rotation rates can for the most part be understood by applying
first order perturbation theory to the anelastic modes. We calculate the energy
and angular momentum exchanged as a result of the tidal encounter and for
coreless models again find good agreement with results obtained using either
the anelastic spectral method. Models with a solid core showed evidence of the
emission of shear layers at critical latitudes and possibly wave attractors
after the encounter but the total energy exchanged during the encounter did not
differ dramatically from the coreless case as long as the ratio of the core
radius to the total radius was less than 50%, there being hardly any difference
at all when this ratio was less than 25% of the total radius. We give a
physical and mathematical interpretation of this result. Finally we are able to
validate the use of the anelastic approximation for both the work presented

planets in highly eccentric orbits.

of games that are induced by this decomposition, and in particular, focus on
games with no harmonic component and games with no potential component. We show
that the first class corresponds to the well-known potential games. We refer to
the second class of games as harmonic games, and study the structural and
equilibrium properties of this new class of games. Intuitively, the potential
component of a game captures interactions that can equivalently be represented
as a common interest game, while the harmonic part represents the conflicts
between the interests of the players. We make this intuition precise, by
studying the properties of these two classes, and show that indeed they have
quite distinct and remarkable characteristics. For instance, while finite
potential games always have pure Nash equilibria, harmonic games generically
never do. Moreover, we show that the nonstrategic component does not affect the
equilibria of a game, but plays a fundamental role in their efficiency
properties, thus decoupling the location of equilibria and their payoff-related
properties. Exploiting the properties of the decomposition framework, we obtain
explicit expressions for the projections of games onto the subspaces of
potential and harmonic games. This enables an extension of the properties of
potential and harmonic games to ""nearby"" games. We exemplify this point by
showing that the set of approximate equilibria of an arbitrary game can be
characterized through the equilibria of its projection onto the set of
potential games.

no significant clustering, consistent with the expectation that the 250
micron-selected sources are mostly normal galaxies at z<~ 1. For our 350 micron

correlation amplitudes A of 0.2 and 1.2 at 1', but with relatively large
uncertainties. For samples which preferentially select high redshift galaxies
at z~2-3 we detect significant strong clustering, leading to an estimate of r_0
~ 7-11 h^{-1} Mpc. The slope of our clustering measurements is very steep,
delta~2. The measurements are consistent with the idea that sub-mm sources

observational results: the correlation between the bolometric luminosity of
active galactic nuclei (AGN) and the star formation rate (SFR) in their host
galaxies, and the correlation between SFR and M_* in star-forming (SF)
galaxies. Our analysis is based on M_BH and L_bol measurements in two large
samples of type-I AGN at z~1 and z~2, and the measurements of M_*/M_BH in
0.05<z<0.2 red galaxies. We find that M_*/M_BH depends on M_BH at all
redshifts. At z~2, M_*/M_BH 280 and ~40 for M_BH=10^8 and M_BH=10^9 M_sol,
respectively. M_*/M_BH grows by a factor of ~4-8 from z~2 to z~0 with extreme
cases that are as large as 10-20. The evolution is steeper than reported in
other studies, probably because we treat only AGN in SF hosts. We caution that
estimates of M_*/M_BH evolution which ignore the dependence of this ratio on

tool in constraining models of galaxy evolution. We use source catalogs

factors for completeness and flux boosting are derived by applying our
extraction method to model catalogs and then applied to the raw observational

100-200mJy in all three SPIRE bands, consistent with results from BLAST. The
counts are compared to a range of galaxy evolution models. None of the current

quasar host galaxies, derived from stacking analyses of far-infrared to mm-wave
photometry of quasars with redshifts 0<z<6 and absolute I-band magnitudes
-22>I_AB>-32. We use the science demonstration observations of the first ~16
deg^2 from the Herschel Astrophysical Terahertz Large Area Survey (H-ATLAS) in
which there are 240 quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and a
further 171 from the 2dF-SDSS LRG and QSO (2SLAQ) survey. We supplement this
data with a compilation of data from IRAS, ISO, Spitzer, SCUBA and MAMBO.
H-ATLAS alone statistically detects the quasars in its survey area at >5sigma
at 250, 350 and 500um. From the compilation as a whole we find striking
evidence of downsizing in quasar host galaxy formation: low-luminosity quasars
with absolute magnitudes in the range -22>I_AB>-24 have a comoving star
formation rate (derived from 100um rest-frame luminosities) peaking between
redshifts of 1 and 2, while high-luminosity quasars with I_AB<-26 have a
maximum contribution to the star formation density at z~3. The volume-averaged
star formation rate of -22>I_AB>-24 quasars evolves as (1+z)^{2.3 +/- 0.7} at
z<2, but the evolution at higher luminosities is much faster reaching (1+z)^{10
+/- 1} at -26>I_AB>-28. We tentatively interpret this as a combination of a
declining major merger rate with time and gas consumption reducing fuel for
both black hole accretion and star formation.

SDSS DR7 main galaxy sample, focusing on the projected correlation function
w_p(r_p) of volume-limited samples. We interpret our measurements using halo
occupation distribution (HOD) modeling assuming a Lambda-CDM cosmology. The
amplitude of w_p(r_p) grows slowly with luminosity for L < L_* and increases
sharply at higher luminosities, with bias factor b(>L)=1.06+0.23(L/L_*)^{1.12}.
At fixed luminosity, redder galaxies have a stronger and steeper w_p(r_p), a
trend that runs steadily from the bluest galaxies to the reddest galaxies. The
individual luminosity trends for the red and blue galaxy populations are
strikingly different. Blue galaxies show a slow but steady increase of w_p(r_p)
with luminosity, at all scales. The large-scale clustering of red galaxies
shows little luminosity dependence until a sharp increase at L > 4L_*, but the
lowest luminosity red galaxies (0.04-0.25 L_*) show very strong clustering on
scales r_p < 2 Mpc/h. Most of the observed trends can be naturally understood
within the LCDM+HOD framework. The growth of w_p(r_p) with luminosity reflects
an overall shift in the halo mass scale, in particular an increase in the
minimum host halo mass Mmin. The mass at which a halo has, on average, one
satellite galaxy brighter than L is M_1 ~ 17 Mmin(L) over most of the
luminosity range. The growth and steepening of w_p(r_p) for redder galaxies
reflects the increasing fraction of galaxies that are satellite systems in high
mass halos instead of central systems in low mass halos, a trend that is
especially marked at low luminosities. Our extensive measurements, provided in
tabular form, will allow detailed tests of theoretical models of galaxy
formation, a firm grounding of semi-empirical models of the galaxy population,
and new cosmological tests.

supersonic coherent flows of the baryons relative to the underlying potential
wells created by the dark matter. As a result, the advection of small-scale
perturbations (near the baryonic Jeans scale) by large-scale velocity flows is
important for the formation of the first baryonic structures. This effect
involves a quadratic term in the cosmological perturbation theory equations and
hence has not been included in studies based on linear perturbation theory. We
show that the relative motion suppresses the abundance of the first bound

qualitative changes in their spatial distribution, such as introducing

nonlinearly-generated zonal flows results in a saturated turbulent state.
Comparisons of these simulations with measurements in LAPD plasmas reveal good
qualitative and reasonable quantitative agreement, in particular in frequency
spectrum, spatial correlation and amplitude probability distribution function
of density fluctuations. For comparison with LAPD measurements, the plasma
density profile in simulations is maintained either by direct azimuthal
averaging on each time step, or by adding particle source/sink function. The
inferred source/sink values are consistent with the estimated ionization source
and parallel losses in LAPD. These simulations lay the groundwork for more a
comprehensive effort to test fluid turbulence simulation against LAPD data.

turbulent flows. Our general formulation shows that the relative velocity has
contributions from two terms, referred to as the generalized acceleration and
generalized shear terms, because they reduce to the well known acceleration and
shear terms in the Saffman-Turner limit. The generalized shear term represents
particles' memory of the flow velocity difference along their trajectories and
depends on the inertial particle pair dispersion backward in time. The
importance of this backward dispersion in determining the particle relative
velocity is emphasized. We find that our model with a two-phase separation
behavior, an early ballistic phase and a later tracer-like phase, as found by
recent simulations for the forward (in time) dispersion of inertial particle
pairs, gives good fits to the measured relative speeds from simulations at low
Reynolds numbers. In the monodisperse case with identical particles, the
generalized acceleration term vanishes and the relative velocity is determined
by the generalized shear term. At large Reynolds numbers, our model gives a
$St^{1/2}$ dependence of the relative velocity on the Stokes number $St$ in the
inertial range for both the ballistic behavior and the Richardson separation
law. This leads to the same inertial-range scaling for the two-phase separation
that well fits the simulation results. Our calculations for the bidisperse case
show that, with the friction timescale of one particle fixed, the relative
speed as a function of the other particle's friction time has a dip when the
two timescales are similar. We find that the primary contribution at the dip is
from the generalized shear term, while the generalized acceleration term is
dominant for particles of very different sizes.

large-scale structure. Growth of structure causes gas to move from the diffuse
photoionized IGM into other cosmic phases, namely stars, cold and hot gas
within galaxy halos, and the unbound and shock-heated warm-hot intergalactic
medium (WHIM). By today, baryons are roughly equally divided between bound
phases (35%), the diffuse IGM (41%), and the WHIM (24%). Here we (re)define the
WHIM as gas with overdensities lower than that in halos and temperatures >10^5

photoionizing background to match the observed evolution of the Ly-alpha mean
flux decrement, we obtain a line count evolution that broadly agrees with

favored momentum-driven wind model, in agreement with recent observations, and
it becomes shallower with redshift. With improved statistics, the frequency of
strong lines can be a valuable diagnostic of outflows, and our favored wind
model matches existing data best among our models. The relationship between
column density and physical density is fairly tight from z=2-0, and evolves as
rho N_HI^0.74 10^(-0.37z) for diffuse absorbers. Linewidths only loosely
reflect the temperature of the absorbing gas, which will hamper attempts to

very sharp kinks. Using numerical simulations of realistic, evolving cosmic

large enough to accommodate a sufficient number of tearing and kink modes.
Contrary to the non-relativistic limit, the linear tearing instability is
faster than the linear kink instability, at least in our specific parameters.
We find that the magnetic energy dissipation is first facilitated by the
tearing instability and followed by the secondary kink instability. Particles
are mostly energized inside the magnetic islands during the tearing stage due
to the spatially varying electric fields produced by the outflows from
reconnection. Secondary kink instability leads to additional particle
acceleration. Accelerated particles are, however, observed to be thermalized
quickly. The large amplitude of the vertical magnetic field resulting from the
tearing modes by the secondary kink modes further help thermalizing the
non-thermal particles generated from the secondary kink instability.
Implications of these results for astrophysics are briefly discussed.

borderline of microscopic coexistence and macroscopic phase separation,
explaining the experimentally observed competition of both ordered states. In
contrast, conventional $s^{++}$ pairing is not able to coexist with magnetism.
Expanding the microscopic free energy of the system with competing orders
around the multicritical point, we find that static magnetism plays the role of
an intrinsic interband Josephson coupling, making the phase diagram sensitive
to the symmetry of the Cooper pair wavefunction. We relate this result to the
quasiparticle excitation spectrum and to the emergent SO$(5)$ symmetry of
systems with particle-hole symmetry. Our results rely on the assumption that
the same electrons that form the ordered moment contribute to the
superconducting condensate and that the system is close to particle-hole
symmetry. We also compare the suppression of SC in different regions of the

competition with AFM, in the overdoped side it is related to the disappearance

results from the Earth model on the location of the deepest liquid water on

intersection of liquid water and terrestrial phase space indicates that the
deepest liquid water environments in the lithosphere occur at a depth of ~ 75
km. 3.5 % of the volume of the Earth is above 75 km depth. Considering the 3.5
% of the volume of the Earth where liquid water exists, ~ 12% of this volume is
inhabited by life while the remaining ~ 88% is uninhabited. This is distinct
from the fraction of the volume of liquid water occupied by life. We find that
at least 1% of the volume of liquid water on Earth is uninhabited. Better

either to plasmon or particle-hole modes. In this paper, we numerically
calculate the plasmon contribution to the absorption spectrum when an external
electric field is applied. The number of peaks depends on the radius of the
inner as well as outer tubule. The height of each peak is determined by the
plasmon wavelength and energy. For a chosen wave number, the most energetic
plasmon has the highest peak corresponding to the largest oscillator strength
of the excited modes. Some of the low-frequency plasmon modes have such weak
coupling to an external electric field that they are not seen on the same scale
as the modes with larger energy of excitation. We plot the peak positions of
the plasmon excitations for a pair of coaxial tubules. The coupled modes on the
two tubules are split by the Coulomb interaction. The energies of the two
highest plasmon branches increase with the radius of the outer tubule. On the
contrary, the lowest modes decrease in energy as this radius is increased. No

nonclassical features of quantum probabilities. On this view, what is
fundamental in the transition from classical to quantum physics is the
recognition that \emph{information in the physical sense has new structural
features}, just as the transition from classical to relativistic physics rests
on the recognition that space-time is structurally different than we thought.
Hilbert space, the event space of quantum systems, is interpreted as a
kinematic (i.e., pre-dynamic) framework for an indeterministic physics, in the
sense that the geometric structure of Hilbert space imposes objective
probabilistic or information-theoretic constraints on correlations between
events, just as the geometric structure of Minkowski space in special
relativity imposes spatio-temporal kinematic constraints on events. The
interpretation of quantum probabilities is more subjectivist in spirit than
other discussions in this book (e.g., the chapter by Timpson), insofar as the
quantum state is interpreted as a credence function---a bookkeeping device for
keeping track of probabilities---but it is also objective (or intersubjective),
insofar as the credences specified by the quantum state are understood as
uniquely determined, via Gleason's theorem, by objective correlational
constraints on events in the nonclassical quantum event space defined by the
subspace structure of Hilbert space.

processes in the SU(3) \otimes SU(3)_\text{color} gauge-Higgs unification

since the Yukawa couplings are originally higher dimensional gauge
interactions. We argue that the presence of Z_2-odd bulk masses of fermions
plays a crucial role as the new source of flavor violation. Although
introducing brane-localized mass terms in addition to the bulk masses is
necessary to realize flavor mixing, if the bulk masses were universal among
generations, the flavor mixing and flavor changing neutral current processes
are known to disappear. We also discuss whether natural flavor conservation is
realized in the scenario. It is shown that the new source of flavor violation
leads to flavor changing neutral current processes at the tree level due to the
exchange of non-zero Kaluza-Klein gauge bosons. As a typical example we
calculate the rate of K^0 - \bar{K}^0 mixing due to the non-zero Kaluza-Klein
gluon exchange at the tree level. The obtained result for the mass difference
of neutral kaon is suppressed by the inverse powers of the compactification
scale. By comparing our prediction with the data we obtain the lower bound of
the compactification scale as a function of one unfixed parameter of the

that the reason to get such rather mild lower bound is the presence of

region. The most important advantage of this approach is that one does not have
to make any a priori assumptions about the functional form of the spectral
function, such as the ""pole + continuum"" ansatz that has been widely used in
QCD sum rule studies, but only needs to specify the asymptotic values of the
spectral function at high and low energies as an input. As a first test of the
applicability of this method, we have analyzed the sum rules of the rho-meson,
a case where the sum rules are known to work well. Our results show a clear
peak structure in the region of the experimental mass of the rho-meson. We thus
demonstrate that the Maximum Entropy Method is successfully applied and that it
is an efficient tool in the analysis of QCD sum rules.

Second, the contribution to the primordial curvature perturbation that is

inflation, the spectrum of this contribution is strongly blue and hence is

possible constraints from comparisons with observation of extremely metal-poor

explain the characteristics of the observed metallicity distribution function
(MDF) including a break around [Fe/H]~-4. (2) A high mass IMF of peak mass
~10Msun with the contribution of binaries, derived from the statistics of
carbon enhanced EMP stars (Komiya et al. 2007), predicts the frequency of
low-mass survivors consistent with the number of EMP stars observed for
-4~<[Fe/H]~<-2.5. (3) The stars formed from primordial gas before the first
supernova explosions in their host mini-halos are assigned to the HMP stars
with [Fe/H]~-5. (4) There is no indication of significant changes in the IMF
and the binary contribution at metallicity -4~<[Fe/H]~<-2.5, or even larger as
long as the field stars of Galactic halo are concerned. We further study the
effects of the surface pollution through the accretion of ISM along the
chemical and dynamical evolution of the Galaxy for low-mass Pop.III and EMP
survivors. Because of shallower potential of smaller halos, the accretion of
ISM in the mini-halos in which these stars were born dominates the surface
metal pollution. This can account for the surface iron abundances as observed
for the HMP stars if the cooling and concentration of gas in their birth
mini-halos is taken into account. We also study the feedback effect from the
very massive Pop. III stars. The metal pre-pollution by PISNe is shown to be
compatible with the observed lack of their nucleosynthetic signatures when some
positive feedback on gas cooling works and changes IMF from being very massive
to being high mass.

of Rashba type is present. Polarization in the contacts is described by means
of Zeeman fields. Our model predicts two types of conductance oscillations:
Ramsauer oscillations in the minority spin transmission, when both spins can
propagate, and Fano oscillations when only one spin propagates. The latter are
due to the spin-orbit coupling with quasibound states of the non propagating
spin. In the case of polarized contacts in antiparallel configuration Fano-like
oscillations of the conductance are still made possible by the spin orbit
coupling, even though no spin component is bound by the contacts. To describe
these behaviors we propose a simplified model based on an ansatz wave function.
In general, we find that the contribution for vanishing transverse momentum
dominates and defines the conductance oscillations. Regarding the oscillations
with Rashba coupling intensity, our model confirms the spin transistor
behavior, but only for high degrees of polarization. Including a position
dependent effective mass yields additional oscillations due to the mass jumps
at the interfaces.

coincides with that of the dressed Polyakov loop in the whole $(T,\mu)$ plane.
In the case of explicit chiral symmetry breaking, it is found that the
transition temperature for chiral restoration $T_c^{\chi}$ is smaller than that
of the dressed Polyakov loop $T_c^{{\cal D}}$ in the low baryon density region
where the transition is a crossover. With the increase of current quark mass
the difference between the two transition temperatures is found to be
increasing. However, the two critical temperatures coincide in the high baryon
density region where the phase transition is of first order. We give an
explanation on the feature of $T_c^{\chi}=T_c^{\cal D}$ in the case of 1st and
2nd order phase transitions, and $T_c^{\chi}<T_c^{\cal D}$ in the case of
crossover, and expect this feature is general and can be extended to full QCD
theory. Our result might indicate that in the case of crossover, there exists a
small region where chiral symmetry is restored but the color degrees of freedom
are still confined.

Our aim is to confirm the interstellar detection of cyanic acid, HOCN,

  Methods. We used a complete line survey of the hot cores Sgr B2(N) and (M) in
the 3 mm range, complemented by additional observations carried out with the
IRAM 30 m telescope at selected frequencies in the 2 mm band and towards four
additional positions in the Sgr B2 cloud complex in the 2 and 3 mm bands. The
spectral survey was analysed in the local thermodynamical equilibrium
approximation (LTE) by modeling the emission of all identified molecules
simultaneously. This allowed us to distinguish weak features of HOCN from the
rich line spectrum observed in Sgr B2(N) and (M). Lines of the more stable (by
1.1 eV) isomer isocyanic acid, HNCO, in these sources, as well as those of HOCN
and HNCO towards the other positions, were analysed in the LTE approximation as
well.
  Results. Four transitions of HOCN were detected in a quiescent molecular
cloud in the Galactic center at a position offset in (R.A., decl.) by
(20'',100'') from the hot core source Sgr B2(M), confirming its previous
tentative interstellar detection. Up to four transitions were detected toward
five other positions in the Sgr B2 complex, including the hot cores Sgr B2(M),

deriving these dust properties. We fit the 100 to 350 micron observations of

single temperature and fixed emissivity law. The data used are existing
observations at 100 and 160 micron (from IRAS and Spitzer) and new SPIRE
observations of 1/4 of the LMC observed for the HERITAGE Key Project as part of
the Herschel Science Demonstration phase. The dust temperatures and masses
computed using only 100 and 160 micron data can differ by up to 10% and 36%,
respectively, from those that also include the SPIRE 250 & 350 micron data. We
find that an emissivity law proportional to lambda^-1.5 minimizes the 100-350
micron fractional residuals. We find that the emission at 500 micron is ~10%
higher than expected from extrapolating the fits made at shorter wavelengths.
We find the fractional 500 micron excess is weakly anti-correlated with MIPS 24
micron flux and the total gas surface density. This argues against a flux
calibration error as the origin of the 500 micron excess. Our results do not
allow us to distinguish between a systematic variation in the wavelength
dependent emissivity law or a population of very cold dust only detectable at
lambda > 500 micron for the origin of the 500 micron excess.

the weak-gauge bosons at the electroweak scale as in the standard model,
fermion masses are generated by an unknown mechanism at a higher energy scale.
At low energies, the standard model can then be regarded as an effective field
theory, where fermion masses explicitly break the electroweak SU(2)_L \times
U(1)_Y gauge symmetry. If \Lambda is the renormalization scale where the
renormalized Yukawa couplings vanish, then at energies lower than \Lambda,
effective Yukawa couplings will be radiatively induced by nonzero fermion
masses. In this scenario, Higgs-boson decays into photons and weak gauge-bosons
pairs are in general quite enhanced for a light Higgs. However, depending on
\Lambda, a substantial decay rate into b \bar{b} can arise, that can be of the

accelerated solutions. For constant scalar field, eqs reduce to usual FRW eqs
with typical radiation dominated universe. For this situation we obtain
dynamics of scale factors for any geometry without any priori assumption. For
nonconstant scalar fields and spatially flat geometries, solutions are found to
be power law and exponential ones. We also employ weak energy condition for
induced matter, that allows negative/positive pressures. All types of solutions
fulfill WEC in different ranges. The power law solutions with negative/positive
pressures admit both decelerating and accelerating ones. Some solutions accept
shrinking extra dimension. By considering nonghost scalar fields and recent
observational measurements, solutions are more restricted. We illustrate that
accelerating power law solutions, which satisfy WEC and have nonghost fields,
are compatible with recent observations in ranges -4/3 < \omega </- -1.3151 and
1.5208 </- n < 1.9583 for dependence of fifth dimension scale factor with usual
scale factor. These ranges also fulfill condition nonghost fields in the
equivalent 4D vacuum BD eqs.

using a partial analogy with the treatment of the atom in spherical and

inertia $I$ for radius and two pure-shape coordinates. These are \Theta, a
function of the ratio of the two relative separations of subsystems, and \Phi,
the relative angle between the two subsystems. Parabolic coordinates are \Phi

these solutions using 1) a `Bohr moment of inertia' for the model universe

three last authors to investigate various Abelian properties of words. In
particular, using van der Waerden's theorem, they proved that if a word avoids
Abelian $k$-powers for some integer $k$, then its Abelian complexity is
unbounded. This suggests the following question: How frequently do Abelian
$k$-powers occur in a word having bounded Abelian complexity? In particular,
does every uniformly recurrent word having bounded Abelian complexity begin in
an Abelian $k$-power? While this is true for various classes of uniformly
recurrent words, including for example the class of all Sturmian words, in this
paper we show the existence of uniformly recurrent binary words, having bounded
Abelian complexity, which admit an infinite number of suffixes which do not
begin in an Abelian square. We also show that the shift orbit closure of any
infinite binary overlap-free word contains a word which avoids Abelian cubes in
the beginning. We also consider the effect of morphisms on Abelian complexity
and show that the morphic image of a word having bounded Abelian complexity has
bounded Abelian complexity. Finally, we give an open problem on avoidability of
Abelian squares in infinite binary words and show that it is equivalent to a

systems, such as aging spin and structural glasses, sheared soft matter, and
active matter, a form of FDR has been proposed in which an effective
temperature, Teff, replaces the usual temperature, and universal behavior is
found in mean-field models and simulations. Thus far, only experiments on
spin-glasses and liquid crystals have succeeded in accessing the strong aging
regime, where Teff >T and possible scaling behavior are expected. Here we test
these ideas through measurements of local dielectric response and polarization
noise in an aging structural glass, poly-vinyl-acetate . The relaxation-time

outflow creating a bright shock. The relative contribution of both heating
mechanisms is the matter of a long debate. By better sampling the excitation
ladder of various tracers we provide a quantitative distinction between the
different heating mechanisms. HIFI observations of mid-J transitions of CO and
HCO+ isotopes allow us to bridge the gap in excitation energies between
observations from the ground, characterizing the cooler gas, and existing ISO
LWS spectra, constraining the properties of the hot gas. Comparing the detailed
line profiles allows to identify the physical structure of the different
components. In spite of the known shock-excitation of H2 and the clearly
visible strong outflow, we find that the emission of all lines up to > 2 THz
can be explained by purely radiative heating of the material. However, the new

hot and dense clumps close to the central cluster, probably dynamically

HIFI spectra towards high-mass star-forming regions, and interpret its
astrophysical origin. The characteristic hyperfine pattern of the H2O+
ground-state rotational transition, and the lack of other known low-energy
transitions in this frequency range, identifies the feature as H2O+ absorption
against the dust continuum background and allows us to derive the velocity
profile of the absorbing gas. By comparing this velocity profile with velocity
profiles of other tracers in the DR21 star-forming region, we constrain the
frequency of the transition and the conditions for its formation. In DR21, the
velocity distribution of H2O+ matches that of the [CII] line at 158\mu\m and of
OH cm-wave absorption, both stemming from the hot and dense clump surfaces
facing the HII-region and dynamically affected by the blister outflow. Diffuse
foreground gas dominates the absorption towards Sgr B2. The integrated
intensity of the absorption line allows us to derive lower limits to the H2O+

parallel dimers on a plaquette was shown to undergo a continuous phase
transition with critical exponents close to those of the O(N) tricritical
universality class, a situation which is not easily captured by conventional
field theories. That the dimer model is exactly fine-tuned to a highly
symmetric point is a non trivial statement which needs careful numerical
investigation. In this paper, we perform an extensive Monte Carlo study of a
generalized dimer model with plaquette and cubic interactions and determine its
extended phase diagram. We find that when both interactions favor alignment of
the dimers, the phase transition is first order, in almost all cases. On the
opposite, when interactions compete, the transition becomes continuous, with a
critical exponent \eta ~ 0.2. The existence of a tricritical point between the
two regimes is confirmed by simulations on very large size systems and a
flowgram method. In addition, we find a highly-degenerate crystalline phase at
very low temperature in the frustrated regime which is separated from the
columnar phase by a first order transition.

supersymmetry-breaking vacua in theories with N=1 and N=2 global supersymmetry.
This problem turns out to capture all the important qualitative features of the
corresponding question in theories with local supersymmetry, where
gravitational effects induce only quantitative modifications. Moreover, it
allows to directly compare the conditions arising in the N=1 and N=2 cases,
since the latter becomes particular case of the former in the rigid limit. Our
strategy consists in a systematic investigation of the danger of instability
coming from the sGoldstini scalars, whose masses are entirely due to
supersymmetry breaking mass-splitting effects. We start by reviewing the
metastability conditions arising in general N=1 non-linear sigma-models with
chiral and vector multiplets. We then turn to the case of general N=2
non-linear sigma-models with hyper and vector multiplets. We first reproduce
and clarify the known no-go theorems applying to theories with only Abelian
vector multiplets and only hyper multiplets, and then derive new results
applying to more general cases. To make the comparison with N=1 models as clear
as possible, we rely on a formulation of N=2 models where one of the
supersymmetries is manifestly realized in terms of ordinary superfields,
whereas the other is realized through non-trivial transformations. We give a
self-contained account of such a construction of N=2 theories in N=1
superspace, generalizing previous work on various aspects to reach a general
and coordinate-covariant construction. We also present a direct computation of
the supertrace of the mass matrix.

a common and yet poorly studied feature of early-type galaxies. Still, such
small disks represent a powerful tool to constrain the assembling history of
galaxies, since they can be used to trace to the epoch when galaxies
experienced their last major merger event. By studying the fraction and stellar
age of NSDs it is thus possible to test the predictions for the assembly
history of early-type galaxies according the current hierarchical paradigm for
galaxy formation. In this paper we have produced the most comprehensive census
of NSDs in nearby early-type galaxies by searching for such disks in objects
within 100 Mpc and by using archival images from the Hubble Space Telescope. We
found that NSDs are present in approximately 20% of early-type galaxies, and
that the fraction of galaxies with NSDs does not depend on their Hubble type
nor on their galactic environment, whereas the incidence of NSDs appears to
decline in the most massive systems. Furthermore, we have separated the light
contribution of twelve such disks from that of their surrounding stellar bulge
in order to extract their physical properties. This doubles the number of
decomposed NSDs and although the derived values for their central surface
brightness and scale-length are consistent with previous studies they also give
a hint of possible different characteristics due to different formation
scenario between nuclear disks and other kinds of large galactic disks.

strongly enhances random velocities of planetesimals and makes collisions

successive collisions. Eventually the smallest fragments are removed by the
inward drift due to gas drag. Therefore, the collisional disruption depletes
the planetesimal disk and inhibits embryo growth. We provide analytical
formulae for the final masses of planetary embryos, taking into account
planetesimal depletion due to collisional disruption. Furthermore, we perform
the statistical simulations for embryo growth (which excellently reproduce

the nebular disk is 10 times more massive than the minimum-mass solar nebula

has usually been interpreted as the presence of a self-shielded H2 component
not traced by CO molecular clouds' envelopes. Based on Herschel observations,
we examine the correlation between gas and dust at higher resolution than
previously achieved. We consider three additional causes for the FIR excess: X
factor, FIR dust emissivity, and gas-to-dust ratio variations between the
diffuse and dense phases of the ISM. We examine the structure of NT80 and NT71,
two molecular clouds detected in the NANTEN 12CO survey of the LMC. Dust
surface density maps are derived from the HERITAGE data. The gas phase is
traced by MAGMA 12CO and ATCA HI 21 cm observations of the LMC. The dust
emissivity, gas-to-dust ratio, and X factor required to match the dust and gas
surface densities are derived, and their correlations with the dust surface
density are examined. The dust surface density is spatially correlated with the
atomic and molecular gas phases. The dust temperature is consistently lower in
the dense phase of the ISM than in the diffuse phase. We confirm variations in
the ratio of FIR emission to gas surface density derived from HI and CO
observations. There is an excess of FIR emission, spatially correlated with
regions of intermediate HI and dust surface densities (Av = 1-2), and little or
no CO. While there is no significant trend in the dust emissivity or
gas-to-dust ratio with dust surface density, the X factor is enhanced at Av =
1-2. We conclude that H2 envelopes not traced by CO and X factor variations
close to the CO boundary are more likely to cause these deviations between FIR
emission and gas surface density than gas-to-dust ratio or emissivity
variations.

We find that cosmic variance will depend on a number of factors principally:
total survey volume, survey aspect ratio, and whether the area surveyed is
contiguous or comprised of independent sight-lines. As a rule of thumb cosmic
variance falls below 10% once a volume of 10^7h_0.7^-3Mpc^3 is surveyed for a
single contiguous region with a 1:1 aspect ratio. Cosmic variance will be lower
for higher aspect ratios and/or non-contiguous surveys. Extrapolating outside
our test region we infer that cosmic variance in the entire SDSS DR7 main
survey region is ~7% to z < 0.1. The equation obtained from the SDSS DR7 region
can be generalised to estimate the cosmic variance for any density measurement
determined from normal galaxies (e.g., luminosity densities, stellar mass
densities and cosmic star-formation rates) within the volume range 10^3 to 10^7
h^-3_0.7Mpc^3. We apply our equation to show that 2 sightlines are required to
ensure cosmic variance is <10% in any ASKAP galaxy survey (divided into dz ~0.1
intervals, i.e., ~1 Gyr intervals for z <0.5). Likewise 10 MeerKAT sightlines
will be required to meet the same conditions. GAMA, VVDS, and zCOSMOS all
suffer less than 10% cosmic variance (~3%-8%) in dz intervals of 0.1, 0.25, and
0.5 respectively. Finally we show that cosmic variance is potentially at the
50-70% level, or greater, in the HST Ultra Deep Field depending on assumptions
as to the evolution of clustering. 100 or 10 independent sightlines will be
required to reduce cosmic variance to a manageable level (<10%) for HST ACS or
HST WFC3 surveys respectively (in dz ~ 1 intervals). Cosmic variance is
therefore a significant factor in the z>6 HST studies currently underway.

matched load simulating a blackbody at different temperatures was placed in

temperature, gain, and noise performance, e.g. 1/f noise. The spectral response
of each detector was measured as was their susceptibility to thermal variation.
All eleven LFI RCAs were calibrated. Instrumental parameters measured in these
tests, such as noise temperature, bandwidth, radiometer isolation, and
linearity, provide essential inputs to the Planck-LFI data analysis.

  Sensing",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The knowledge of channel statistics can be very helpful in making sound
opportunistic spectrum access decisions. It is therefore desirable to be able
to efficiently and accurately estimate channel statistics. In this paper we
study the problem of optimally placing sensing times over a time window so as
to get the best estimate on the parameters of an on-off renewal channel. We are
particularly interested in a sparse sensing regime with a small number of
samples relative to the time window size. Using Fisher information as a
measure, we analytically derive the best and worst sensing sequences under a
sparsity condition. We also present a way to derive the best/worst sequences
without this condition using a dynamic programming approach. In both cases the
worst turns out to be the uniform sensing sequence, where sensing times are
evenly spaced within the window. With these results we argue that without a
priori knowledge, a robust sensing strategy should be a randomized strategy. We
then compare different random schemes using a family of distributions generated
by the circular $\beta$ ensemble, and propose an adaptive sensing scheme to
effectively track time-varying channel parameters. We further discuss the
applicability of compressive sensing for this problem.

transparent way to probe the contribution of dehydration to ionic transport. We
study the role of ionic species in the formation of hydration layers inside and
outside of pores. We find that the ion type plays only a minor role in the
radial positions of the predicted steps in the ion conductance. However, ions
with higher valency form stronger hydration shells, and thus, provide even more
pronounced, and therefore, more easily detected, drops in the ionic current.
Measuring this phenomenon directly, or from the resulting noise, with synthetic
nanopores would provide evidence of the deviation from macroscopic (continuum)
dielectric behavior due to microscopic features at the nanoscale and may shed
light on the behavior of ions in more complex biological channels.

within a large class of admissible bijective mappings is of great importance.
Such process is called surface registration. The difficulty lies in the fact
that the space of all surface diffeomorphisms is a complicated functional
space, making exhaustive search for the best mapping challenging. To tackle
this problem, we propose a simple representation of bijective surface maps
using Beltrami coefficients (BCs), which are complex-valued functions defined
on surfaces with supreme norm less than 1. Fixing any 3 points on a pair of
surfaces, there is a 1-1 correspondence between the set of surface
diffeomorphisms between them and the set of BCs. Hence, every bijective surface
map can be represented by a unique BC. Conversely, given a BC, we can
reconstruct the unique surface map associated to it using the Beltrami
Holomorphic flow (BHF) method. Using BCs to represent surface maps is
advantageous because it is a much simpler functional space, which captures many
essential features of a surface map. By adjusting BCs, we equivalently adjust
surface diffeomorphisms to obtain the optimal map with desired properties. More
specifically, BHF gives us the variation of the associated map under the
variation of BC. Using this, a variational problem over the space of surface
diffeomorphisms can be easily reformulated into a variational problem over the
space of BCs. This makes the minimization procedure much easier. More
importantly, the diffeomorphic property is always preserved. We test our method
on synthetic examples and real medical applications. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm for surface
registration.

microscope images has recently become important. This is because of the need to
provide repeatable images with a priori determined parameters. Modeled
artificial images are highly useful in the evaluation of new imaging and
metrological techniques, like image-sharpness calculation, or drift-corrected
image composition (DCIC). Originally, the NIST-developed artificial image
generator was designed only to produce the SEM images of gold-on-carbon
resolution sample for image-sharpness evaluation. Since then, the new improved
version of the software was written in C++ programming language and is in the
Public Domain. The current version of the software can generate arbitrary
samples, any drift function, and many other features. This work describes
scanning in charged-particle microscopes, which is applied both in the
artificial image generator and the DCIC technique. As an example, the
performance of the DCIC technique is demonstrated.
