galaxy M86 and examine the distribution of the resolved cold dust emission and
its relation with other galactic tracers. The SPIRE images reveal three dust
components: emission from the central region; a dust lane extending
north-south; and a bright emission feature 10kpc to the south-east. We estimate
that approximately 10^6 solar masses of dust is spatially coincident with
atomic and ionized hydrogen, originating from stripped material from the nearby
spiral NGC4438 due to recent tidal interactions with M86. The gas-to-dust ratio
of the cold gas component ranges from ~20-80. We discuss the different heating
mechanisms for the dust features.

query algorithm that alternates a certain fixed, input-independent reflection
with a second reflection that coherently queries the input string. Originally
introduced for solving the unstructured search problem, this two-reflections
structure is therefore a universal feature of quantum algorithms.
  Our proof goes via the general adversary bound, a semi-definite program (SDP)
that lower-bounds the quantum query complexity of a function. By a quantum
algorithm for evaluating span programs, this lower bound is known to be tight
up to a sub-logarithmic factor. The extra factor comes from converting a
continuous-time query algorithm into a discrete-query algorithm. We give a
direct and simplified quantum algorithm based on the dual SDP, with a
bounded-error query complexity that matches the general adversary bound.
  Therefore, the general adversary lower bound is tight; it is in fact an SDP
for quantum query complexity. This implies that the quantum query complexity of
the composition f(g,...,g) of two boolean functions f and g matches the product
of the query complexities of f and g, without a logarithmic factor for error
reduction. It further shows that span programs are equivalent to quantum query
algorithms.

hard scattered partons as they traverse the partonic medium produced in heavy
ion collisions at RHIC. These results are generally compared to jet
correlations in p+p collsisions where all correlation strength is attributed to
vacuum fragmentation. Strong modification to di-jet correlations has been
observed in A+A collisions at RHIC, most notably for the away side jet. Many
different effects, including the opacity of the medium, its response to energy
deposited by partons as they propagate, and modifications to the parton
fragmentation, are involved in producing the final correlation stuctures.
Understanding the interplay between these various effects is essential to
developing a complete picture of the medium. Measurements of jet correlations
involving direct photons provide a unique probe of jet fragmentation effects,
as photons are not strongly interacting. Additionally, systematic studies of
the away side structure as a function of $p_{T}$, as well as attempts to
include additional high $p_{T}$ trigger requirements, can help to distinguish
different energy loss mechanisms. We discuss recent PHENIX results from these
detailed studies of jet correlations in A+A and p+p collisions.

time-resolved optical spectroscopy (~3800-5000A) covering 4 eclipses. Eclipse
maps of the HeII 4686 line indicate that an azimuthally-and vertically-extended
bright spot at disk rim is important source of reprocessing of x-rays from the
magnetic poles. The disk spectrum is flat with no Balmer or Helium lines in the
inner regions, and shows double-peaked emission lines in the intermediate and
outer disk regions while the slope of the continuum becomes progressively
redder with increasing radius. The inferred disk temperatures are in the range
T~13500-5000K and can be reasonably well described by a steady-state disk with
mass accretion rate of dM/dt=(2.7+/-1.0)x10^-9 Msun/yr. A comparison of the
radial intensity distribution for the Balmer lines reveals a linear correlation
between the slope of the distribution and the transition energy. The spectrum
of the uneclipsed light is dominated by Balmer and HeI lines in emission with
narrow absorption cores. The observed narrow and redshifted CaII 3934
absorption line in the total light spectra plus the inverse P-Cygni profiles of
the Balmer and HeII 4686 emission lines in spectra of the asymmetric component
indicate radial inflow of gas in the innermost disk regions and are best
explained in terms of magnetically-controlled accretion inside the white dwarf
magnetosphere. We infer projected radial inflow velocities of ~200-500km/s,
significantly lower than both the rotational and the free-fall velocities for
the corresponding range of radii. A combined net emission HeII plus Hbeta
low-velocity eclipse map reveals a twisted dipole emitting pattern near disk
center. This is interpreted as being the projection of accretion curtains onto
the orbital plane at two specific spin phases, as a consequence of the
selection in velocity provided by the spectral eclipse mapping.

  first results)",,"10.1051/0004-6361/201014623",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  By means of different physical mechanisms, the expansion of HII regions can
promote the formation of new stars of all masses. RCW 120 is a nearby Galactic
HII region where triggered star formation occurs. This region is well-studied -
there being a wealth of existing data - and is nearby. However, it is
surrounded by dense regions for which far infrared data is essential to obtain
an unbiased view of the star formation process and in particular to establish
whether very young protostars are present. We attempt to identify all Young
Stellar Objects (YSOs), especially those previously undetected at shorter
wavelengths, to derive their physical properties and obtain insight into the
star formation history in this region. We use Herschel-PACS and -SPIRE images
to determine the distribution of YSOs observed in the field. We use a spectral
energy distribution fitting tool to derive the YSOs physical properties.
Herschel-PACS and -SPIRE images confirm the existence of a young source and
allow us to determine its nature as a high-mass (8-10 MSun) Class 0 object
(whose emission is dominated by a massive envelope) towards the massive
condensation 1 observed at (sub)-millimeter wavelengths. This source was not
detected at 24 micron and only barely seen in the MISPGAL 70 micron data.
Several other red sources are detected at Herschel wavelengths and coincide
with the peaks of the millimeter condensations. SED fitting results for the
brightest Herschel sources indicate that, apart from the massive Class 0 that
forms in condensation 1, young low mass stars are forming around RCW 120. The
YSOs observed on the borders of RCW 120 are younger than its ionizing star,
which has an age of about 2.5 Myr.

transformations, for the one-way speed of any physical entity are confronted
with the corresponding expressions for the one-way measured speed obtained from
a gedanken experiment. The experiment demonstrates that, for an inertial frame
$K'$ in motion relative to an inertial frame $K$ where the one-way speed of
light is isotropic, even the special theory of relativity renders the one-way
speed of light as function of the velocity of $K'$ in agreement with the
Tangherlini transformations. However, the two-way speed of light remains
constant for all inertial frames, in agreement with the two-way experimental
techniques. This implies that there must exist \emph{one and only one} inertial
frame where the one-way speed of light is isotropic. These investigations also
show how we can determine, with certain restrictions, the true speed of a
physical entity and of the true speed of $K'$ relative to $K$.

  application to Lithium Dip stars","Submitted to ApJ",,"10.1088/0004-637X/719/1/313",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The maintenance of large-scale differential rotation in stellar convective
regions by rotationally influenced convective stresses also drives large-scale
meridional flows by angular--momentum conservation. This process is an example
of ``gyroscopic pumping'', and has recently been studied in detail in the solar
context. An important question concerns the extent to which these
gyroscopically pumped meridional flows penetrate into nearby stably stratified
(radiative) regions, since they could potentially be an important source of
non-local mixing. Here we present an extensive study of the gyroscopic pumping
mechanism, using a combination of analytical calculations and numerical
simulations both in Cartesian geometry and in spherical geometry. The various
methods, when compared with one another, provide physical insight into the
process itself, as well as increasingly sophisticated means of estimating the
gyroscopic pumping rate. As an example of application, we investigate the
effects of this large-scale mixing process on the surface abundances of the
light elements Li and Be for stars in the mass range 1.3-1.5 solar masses
(so-called ``Li-dip stars''). We find that gyroscopic pumping is a very
efficient mechanism for circulating material between the surface and the deep
interior, so much in fact that it over-estimates Li and Be depletion by orders
of magnitude for stars on the hot side of the dip.However, when the diffusion
of chemical species back into the surface convection zone is taken into
account, a good fit with observed surface abundances of Li and Be as a function
of stellar mass in the Hyades cluster can be found for reasonable choices of
model parameters.

Hartle-Hawking Green functions in this approach are discussed. Then as a
specific example where the details are easy to handle, I turn to 2+1 dimensions
(BTZ), write down the Green functions explicitly starting with the co-rotating
frame, and observe some structural similarities they have with the Kerr-CFT
scattering amplitudes. Finally, in BTZ, there is also an alternate construction
for the Green functions: we can start from the covering AdS_3 space and use the
method of images. Using a 19th century integral formula, I show the equality
between the boundary correlators arising via the two constructions.

storage that, like Reed-Solomon codes, permit data recovery from any arbitrary
k of n nodes. However regenerating codes possess in addition, the ability to
repair a failed node by connecting to any arbitrary d nodes and downloading an
amount of data that is typically far less than the size of the data file. This
amount of download is termed the repair bandwidth. Minimum storage regenerating
(MSR) codes are a subclass of regenerating codes that require the least amount
of network storage; every such code is a maximum distance separable (MDS) code.
Further, when a replacement node stores data identical to that in the failed
node, the repair is termed as exact.
  The four principal results of the paper are (a) the explicit construction of
a class of MDS codes for d = n-1 >= 2k-1 termed the MISER code, that achieves
the cut-set bound on the repair bandwidth for the exact-repair of systematic
nodes, (b) proof of the necessity of interference alignment in exact-repair MSR
codes, (c) a proof showing the impossibility of constructing linear,
exact-repair MSR codes for d < 2k-3 in the absence of symbol extension, and (d)
the construction, also explicit, of MSR codes for d = k+1. Interference
alignment (IA) is a theme that runs throughout the paper: the MISER code is
built on the principles of IA and IA is also a crucial component to the
non-existence proof for d < 2k-3. To the best of our knowledge, the
constructions presented in this paper are the first, explicit constructions of
regenerating codes that achieve the cut-set bound.

genie-aided upper bounds on the sum-capacity and cut-set bounds on the

techniques. In the noise-limited regime, it is shown that treating interference
as noise achieves the capacity region up to a single bit per user.

is a long-standing prediction of galaxy formation theory in the cold dark
matter cosmogony. This prediction has garnered little observational support,
with non-detections commonplace and detections for only a relatively small
number of galaxies which are much less luminous than expected. We investigate
the coronal properties of a large sample of bright, disc-dominated galaxies
extracted from the GIMIC suite of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations
recently presented by Crain et al. Remarkably, the simulations reproduce the
observed scalings of X-ray luminosity with K-band luminosity and star formation
rate and, when account is taken of the density structure of the halo, with disc
rotation velocity as well. Most of the star formation in the simulated galaxies
(which have realistic stellar mass fractions) is fuelled by gas cooling from a
quasi-hydrostatic hot corona. However, these coronae are more diffuse, and of a
lower luminosity, than predicted by the analytic models of White & Frenk
because of a substantial increase in entropy at z ~ 1-3. Both the removal of
low entropy gas by star formation and energy injection from supernovae
contribute to this increase in entropy, but the latter is dominant for halo
masses M_200 <~ 10^(12.5) Msun. Only a small fraction of the mass of the hot
gas is outflowing as a wind but, because of its high density and metallicity,
it contributes disproportionally to the X-ray emission. The bulk of the X-ray
emission, however, comes from the diffuse quasi-hydrostatic corona which
supplies the fuel for ongoing star formation in discs today. Future deep X-ray
observations with high spectral resolution (e.g. with NeXT/ASTRO-H or IXO)
should be able to map the velocity structure of the hot gas and test this
fundamental prediction of current galaxy formation theory.

there is an attractor for the dark matter systems. Here we identify such a

slopes of the density and velocity dispersion, and the velocity anisotropy.
This attractor effectively removes one degree of freedom from the Jeans
equation. It also allows us to speculate on a new fluid interpretation for the
Jeans equation, with an effective polytropic index for the dark matter
particles between 1/2 and 3/4. If this attractor solution holds for other

and qualitative comparisons of heavy jet mass and the related thrust
distribution are made. From fitting to ALEPH data, a value of alpha_s is
extracted, alpha_s(m_Z)=0.1220 +/- 0.0031, which is larger than, but not in
conflict with, the corresponding value for thrust. A weighted average of the
two produces alpha_s(m_Z) = 0.1193 +/- 0.0027, consistent with the world

treatment of hadronization gives qualitatively different results for thrust and
heavy jet mass, and we conclude that it cannot be trusted to add power

nucleus of NGC253 is compatible with an obscured low luminosity active galactic
nucleus (AGN) or a spatially resolved super star cluster (SSC) brightening up
in X-rays most probably due to young supernovae or supernova remnants. If no
SSC is associated with the kinematic center, we conclude that NGC253 is a
galaxy in which a strong starburst and a weak AGN (either TH2 or X-1) coexist.
Results from few other high resolution studies of nearby starburst galaxies
indicate that the AGN in these systems, if present, is always in the low
luminosity regime. This may indicate that the onset of nuclear activity in
galaxies is closely related with the occurrence of star formation, and that we
are witnessing the emergence or disappearance of an AGN.

high surface brightness, central stellar component that is clearly distinct
from the boxy bar and from the disk. Its brightness profile is a Sersic
function with index n = 1.55 +- 0.07 along the major axis and 1.33 +- 0.12
along the minor axis. Therefore it is a pseudobulge. It is much less luminous
than the boxy bar, so the true pseudobulge-to-total luminosity ratio of the
galaxy is PB/T = 0.06 +- 0.01, much less than the previously believed value of
B/T = 0.4 for the boxy bulge. We infer that published B/T luminosity ratios of
edge-on galaxies with boxy bulges have been overestimated. Therefore, more
galaxies than we thought contain little or no evidence of a merger-built
classical bulge. From a formation point of view, NGC 4565 is a giant, pure-disk

They are no longer gravitationally bound to individual galaxies, but to the
cluster, and their smooth distribution potentially makes them serve as much
denser tracers of the cluster dark matter than the sparsely distributed cluster
galaxies. We present our study of the ICL in Cl 0024+17 using both ACS and
Subaru data, where we previously reported discovery of a ringlike dark matter
structure with gravitational lensing. The ACS images provide much lower sky
levels than ground data, and enable us to measure relative variation of surface
brightness reliably. This analysis is repeated with the Subaru images to
examine if consistent features are recovered despite different reduction scheme
and instrumental characteristics. We find that the ICL profile clearly
resembles the peculiar mass profile, which stops decreasing at r~50"" (~265 kpc)
and slowly increases until it turns over at r~75"" (~397 kpc). This feature is
seen in both ACS and Subaru images for nearly all available passband images
while the features are stronger in red filters. The consistency across
different filters and instruments strongly rules out the possibility that the
feature might come from any residual, uncorrected calibration errors. In
addition, our re-analysis of the cluster X-ray data shows that the peculiar
mass structure is also indicated by a non-negligible bump in the intracluster
gas profile when the geometric center of the dark matter ring, not the peak of
the X-ray emission, is chosen as the center of the radial bin. The location of
the gas ring is closer to the center by ~15"" (~80 kpc), raising an interesting
possibility that the ring-like structure is expanding and the gas ring is
lagging behind perhaps because of the ram pressure if both features in mass and

newly discovered massive circumstellar disk of gas and dust which is one of the
largest disks known today. Seen almost edge-on, the disk is resolved in
high-resolution near-infrared (NIR) images and appears as a dark lane of high
opacity intersecting a bipolar reflection nebula. Based on molecular line
observations we estimate the distance to the object to be 3.5 kpc. This leads
to a size for the dark lane of ~10500 AU but due to shadowing effects the true
disk size could be smaller. In Spitzer/IRAC 3.6 micron images the elongated
shape of the bipolar reflection nebula is still preserved and the bulk of the
flux seems to come from disk regions that can be detected due to the slight
inclination of the disk. At longer IRAC wavelengths, the flux is mainly coming
from the central regions penetrating directly through the dust lane.
Interferometric observations of the dust continuum emission at millimeter
wavelengths with the SMA confirm this finding as the peak of the unresolved
mm-emission coincides perfectly with the peak of the Spitzer/IRAC 5.8 micron
flux and the center of the dark lane seen in the NIR images. Simultaneously
acquired CO data reveal a molecular outflow along the northern part of the
reflection nebula which seems to be the outflow cavity. An elongated gaseous
disk component is also detected and shows signs of rotation. The emission is
perpendicular to the molecular outflow and thus parallel to but even more
extended than the dark lane in the NIR images. Based on the dust continuum and
the CO observations we estimate a disk mass of up to a few solar masses
depending on the underlying assumptions. Whether the disk-like structure is an
actual accretion disk or rather a larger-scale flattened envelope or pseudodisk
is difficult to discriminate with the current dataset (abridged).

fully hydrodynamic cosmological simulations that directly follow black hole
growth. We find that the black hole correlation function is best described by
two distinct components: contributions from BH pairs occupying the same dark
matter halo ('1-halo term') which dominate at scales below 300 kpc/h, and
contributions from BHs occupying separate halos ('2-halo term') which dominate
at larger scales. From the 2-halo BH term we find a typical host halo mass for
faint-end quasars (those probed in our simulation volumes) ranging from 10^11
to a few 10^12 solar masses from z=5 to z=1 respectively (consistent with the
mean halo host mass). The BH correlation function shows a luminosity dependence
as a function of redshift, though weak enough to be consistent with
observational constraints. At small scales, the high resolution of our
simulations allows us to probe the 1-halo clustering in detail, finding that
the 1-halo term follows an approximate power law, lacking the characteristic
decrease in slope at small scales found in 1-halo terms for galaxies and dark
matter. We show that this difference is a direct result of a boost in the
small-scale quasar bias caused by galaxies hosting multiple quasars (1-subhalo
term) following a merger event, typically between a large central subgroup and
a smaller, satellite subgroup hosting a relatively small black hole. We show
that our predicted small-scale excess caused by such mergers is in good
agreement with both the slope and amplitude indicated by recent small-scale
measurements. Finally, we note the excess to be a strong function of halo mass,
such that the observed excess is well matched by the multiple black holes of
intermediate mass (10^7-10^8 solar masses) found in hosts of 4-8*10^11 solar
masses, a range well probed by our simulations.

for 40 Myr, and shows a peak of cluster formation only 3.5 Myr old. With such
an extremely young cluster population, Haro 11 represents a unique opportunity
to investigate the youngest phase of the cluster formation process and
evolution in starburst systems. Extinction tends to diminish as function of the
cluster age, but the spread is large and for clusters in partial embedded
phases (< 5 Myr). A fraction of low-mass (> 10^4 Msun), very young (1-3 Myr)
clusters is missing, either because they are embedded inthe parental molecular
cloud and heavily extinguished, or because of blending. Almost half of the
cluster sample is affected by flux excesses at wavelengths 8000 \AA which
cannot be explained by simple stellar evolutionary models. Fitting SED models
over all wavebands leads to systematic overestimates of cluster ages and
incorrect masses for the stellar population supplying the light in these

emergence of coherent, long-lived vortices without a need to invoke special
initial conditions. Vortices have the ability to sequester particles, with
typical radii from about 1 mm to 10 cm, that are slightly decoupled from the
gas. A generic feature of discs with surface density and effective temperature
profiles that are decreasing, power-law functions of radial distance is that
four vortex zones exist for a fixed particle size. In particular, two of the
zones form an annulus at intermediate radial distances within which small
particles reside. Particle capture by vortices occurs on a dynamical time scale
near and at the boundaries of this annulus. As the disc ages and the particles
grow via coagulation, the size of the annulus shrinks. Older discs prefer to
capture smaller particles because the gas surface density decreases with time,
a phenomenon we term ""vortex aging"". More viscous, more dust-opaque and/or less
massive discs can have vortices that age faster and trap a broader range of
particle sizes throughout the lifetime of the disc. Thus, how efficiently a
disc retains its mass in solids depends on the relative time scales between
coagulation and vortex aging. If vortices form in protoplanetary discs, they
are important in discs with typical masses and for particles that are likely to
condense out of the protostellar nebula. Particle capture also occurs at
distances relevant to planet formation. Future infrared, submillimetre and
centimetre observations of grain opacity as a function of radial distance will
test the hypothesis that vortices serve as nurseries for particle growth in

Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs): (1) 13-band UV+optical+NIR photometric redshifts
to study galaxies in the range z=0.5-2 in three bins of dz=0.5, and (2) dropout
samples in three redshift windows centered at z~1.5, z~1.9, and z~2.5. The
characteristic luminosity dims by ~1.5 mag from z=2.5 to z=0.75, consistent
with earlier work. However, the other Schechter function parameters, the
faint-end slope and the number density, are found to be remarkably constant
over the range z=0.75-2.5. Using these LF determinations we find the UV
luminosity density to increase by ~1.4 dex according to (1+z)^{2.58+-0.15} from
z~0 to its peak at z~2.5. Strikingly, the inferred faint-end slopes for our LFs
are all steeper than alpha=-1.5, in agreement with higher-redshift LBG studies.
Since the faint-end slope in the local universe is found to be much flatter
with alpha~=-1.2, this poses the question as to when and how the expected
flattening occurs. Despite relatively large uncertainties, our data suggest
alpha~=-1.7 at least down to z~1. These new results from such a shallow early
dataset demonstrate very clearly the remarkable potential of WFC3/UVIS for the
thorough characterization of galaxy evolution over the full redshift range
z~0.5 to z~3.

its formation and internal structure. In principle, a light curve of a
transiting planet bears information about the planet's shape, but previous work
has shown that the oblateness-induced signal will be extremely difficult to
detect. Here we investigate the potentially larger signals due to planetary
spin precession. The most readily detectable effects are transit depth
variations (T$\delta$V) in a sequence of light curves. For a planet as oblate
as Jupiter or Saturn, the transit depth will undergo fractional variations of
order 1%. The most promising systems are those with orbital periods of
approximately 15--30 days, which is short enough for the precession period to
be less than about 40 years, and long enough to avoid spin-down due to tidal
friction. The detectability of the T$\delta$V signal would be enhanced by moons
(which would decrease the precession period) or planetary rings (which would
increase the amplitude). The Kepler mission should find several planets for
which precession-induced T$\delta$V signals will be detectable. Due to modeling
degeneracies, Kepler photometry would yield only a lower bound on oblateness.
The degeneracy could be lifted by observing the oblateness-induced asymmetry in
at least one transit light curve, or by making assumptions about the planetary
interior.

observe the 1232.4763 GHz J=1-0 HF transition in the upper sideband of the Band

of A_V >~ 12 mag, which is sufficient to explain the missing optical flux. GRB

the initial magnetization $M_0$ in one of the configurations upon quenching the

complicated non-linear dynamics is described by only a single parameter N ~
2/(1-C(l_{min})) where C(l) is a correlation function of the string tangent

coherence length \xi ~ t/N^2 and the cross-correlation length \chi ~ t/N. At
the onset of evolution N ~ 10 and at late times N is expected to grow
logarithmically due to cosmological stretching and emission of small loops. The
very late time evolution might be modified further when the gravitational

using at least 10^4 particles each for the dark matter and gas component and a
force resolution of epsilon approximately equal to 10^-3 R_vir when studying
global SF and feedback. When the spatial distribution of stars is important,
the number of gas and dark matter particles must be increased to at least 10^5

particularly weak stellar disks due to two-body heating. While decreasing
spatial resolution in low mass resolution simulations limits two-body effects,
density and potential gradients cannot be sustained. Regardless of the
softening, low-mass resolution simulations contain fewer high density regions
where SF may occur. Galaxies of approximately 10^10 solar masses display unique
sensitivity to both mass and force resolution. This mass of galaxy has a
shallow potential and is on the verge of forming a disk. The combination of
these factors give this galaxy the potential for strong gas outflows driven by
supernova feedback and make it particularly sensitive to any changes to the

the Mott transition in two dimensions better than other merit functions.

smaller. We propose an alternate, non-mean-field theory of the ionic

the binding of discrete ions to their image charges in the metal, which results
in the formation of interface dipoles. We focus primarily on the case where
only small cations are mobile and other ions form an oppositely-charged
background. In this case, at small temperature and zero applied voltage dipoles
form a correlated liquid on both contacts. We show that at small voltages the
capacitance of the double-layer is determined by the transfer of dipoles from
one electrode to the other and is therefore limited only by the weak
dipole-dipole repulsion between bound ions, so that the capacitance is very
large. At large voltages the depletion of bound ions from one of the capacitor
electrodes triggers a collapse of the capacitance to the much smaller
mean-field value, as seen in experimental data. We test our analytical
predictions with a Monte Carlo simulation and find good agreement. We further
argue that our ``one-component plasma"" model should work well for strongly

of the fundamental group of a leaf from the foliation. Whenever the polynomial
foliation comes from a perturbation of an exact one-form, one can introduce the
notion of a multi-fold cycle. This type of cycle has at least one
representative that determines a free homotopy class of loops in an open
fibered subdomain of the complex plane. The topology of this subdomain is
closely related to the exact one-form mentioned earlier. We introduce and study
the notion of multi-fold cycles of a close-to-integrable polynomial foliation.

function of the spacetime fields in M-theory. This leads to a potential anomaly
which appears in the eta-invariants upon variation of the Spin structure. The
main source of such spaces are manifolds with nontrivial fundamental group,
which are also important in realistic models. We extend the discussion to the
Spin^c case and find the phase of the partition function, and revisit the
quantization condition for the C-field in this case. In type IIA string theory
in ten dimensions, the mod 2 index of the Dirac operator is the obstruction to
having a well-defined partition function. We geometrically characterize
manifolds with and without such an anomaly and extend to the case of nontrivial
fundamental group. The lift to KO-theory gives the alpha-invariant, which in
general depends on the Spin structure. This reveals many interesting connection
to positive scalar curvature manifolds and constructions related to the
Gromov-Lawson-Rosenberg conjecture. In the twelve-dimensional theory bounding
M-theory, we study similar geometric questions, including choices of metrics
and obtaining elements of K-theory in ten dimensions by pushforward in K-theory
on the disk fiber. We interpret the latter in terms of the families index
theorem for Dirac operators on the M-theory circle and disk. This involves
superconnections, eta-forms, and infinite-dimensional bundles, and gives
elements in Deligne cohomology in lower dimensions. We illustrate our

Signal Processing",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider a two-way relay network, where two source nodes, S1 and S2,
exchange information through a cluster of relay nodes. The relay nodes receive
the sum signal from S1 and S2 in the first time slot. In the second time slot,
each relay node multiplies its received signal by a complex coefficient and
retransmits the signal to the two source nodes, which leads to a distributed
two-way beamforming system. By applying the principle of analog network coding,
each receiver at S1 and S2 cancels the ``self-interference'' in the received
signal from the relay cluster and decodes the message. This paper studies the
2-dimensional achievable rate region for such a two-way relay network with
distributed beamforming. With different assumptions of channel reciprocity
between the source-relay and relay-source channels, the achievable rate region
is characterized under two setups. First, with reciprocal channels, we
investigate the achievable rate regions when the relay cluster is subject to a
sum-power constraint or individual-power constraints. We show that the optimal
beamforming vectors obtained from solving the weighted sum inverse-SNR
minimization (WSISMin) problems are sufficient to characterize the
corresponding achievable rate region. Furthermore, we derive the closed form
solutions for those optimal beamforming vectors and consequently propose the
partially distributed algorithms to implement the optimal beamforming, where
each relay node only needs the local channel information and one global
parameter. Second, with the non-reciprocal channels, the achievable rate
regions are also characterized for both the sum-power constraint case and the
individual-power constraint case. Although no closed-form solutions are
available under this setup, we present efficient algorithms to compute the
optimal beamforming vectors, which are attained by solving SDP problems after
semi-definite relaxation.

line data allowed for a rapid and efficient way to search for molecular
outflows over a large (~ 16 sq. deg.) area. Our outflow-searching technique
detected previously known molecular outflows as well as new candidate outflows.
Most of these new outflow-related high-velocity features lie in regions that
have been poorly studied before. These new outflow candidates more than double
the amount of outflow mass, momentum, and kinetic energy in the Perseus cloud
complex. Our results indicate that outflows have significant impact on the
environment immediately surrounding localized regions of active star formation,
but lack the energy needed to feed the observed turbulence in the entire
Perseus complex. This implies that other energy sources, in addition to
protostellar outflows, are responsible for turbulence on a global cloud scale
in Perseus. We studied the impact of outflows in six regions with active star
formation within Perseus of sizes in the range of 1 to 4 pc. We find that
outflows have enough power to maintain the turbulence in these regions and
enough momentum to disperse and unbind some mass from them. We found no
correlation between outflow strength and star formation efficiency for the six
different regions we studied, contrary to results of recent numerical
simulations. The low fraction of gas that potentially could be ejected due to
outflows suggests that additional mechanisms other than cloud dispersal by
outflows are needed to explain low star formation efficiencies in clusters.

2005 January 15 that occurred between two consecutive solar eruption events,
both of which generated a fast halo CME and a major flare. The post-flare loop
system, formed after the first CME/flare eruption, evolved rapidly, as
manifested by the unusual accelerating rise motion of the loops. Through
nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) models, we obtain the magnetic structure
over the active region. It clearly shows that the flux rope below the loops
also kept rising accompanied with increasing twist and length. Finally, the
post-flare magnetic configuration evolved to a state that resulted in the
second CME/flare eruption. This is an event in which the post-flare loops can
re-flare in a short period of $\sim$16 hr following the first CME/flare
eruption. The observed re-flaring at the same location is likely driven by the
rapid evolution of the flux rope caused by the magnetic flux emergence and the
rotation of the sunspot. This observation provides valuable information on
CME/flare models and their prediction.

by two finite dendrons. The intrinsic $l_1$-metric is thus inherited from the
product of the two finite dendrons via an isometric embedding. The rectangular
cell complexes that share this same embedding property are called ramified
rectilinear polygons. The links of vertices in these cell complexes may be
arbitrary bipartite graphs, in contrast to simple rectilinear polygons where
the links of points are either 4-cycles or paths of length at most 3. Ramified
rectilinear polygons are particular instances of rectangular complexes obtained
from cube-free median graphs, or equivalently simply connected rectangular
complexes with triangle-free links. The underlying graphs of finite ramified
rectilinear polygons can be recognized among graphs in linear time by a
Lexicographic Breadth-First-Search. Whereas the symmetry of a simple
rectilinear polygon is very restricted (with automorphism group being a
subgroup of the dihedral group $D_4$), ramified rectilinear polygons are
universal: every finite group is the automorphism group of some ramified
rectilinear polygon.

shown to be directly related to the formation of pectin-CTAB complexes at the

specific behavior for the highly charged pectin: foam properties depend mainly
upon the bulk charge concentration, while the interfacial behavior is mainly
governed by the charge density of pectin. For the highly charged pectin,
specific cooperative effects between neighboring charged sites along the chain

(SDW) and superconductivity (SC) states has any relation to the
incommensurability of the SDW in the Fe pnictide superconductors. A systematic
method of determining the phase separation or coexistence was employed by
computing the anisotropy coefficient $\beta$ from the the 4th order terms of
the Ginzburg--Landau (GL) expansion of the free energy close to the
tricritical/tetracritical point. It was complemented by the self-consistent
numerical iterations of the gap equations to map out the boundaries between the
phase separation and coexistence of the SDW and SC phases, and between
commensurate (C) and incommensurate (IC) SDW in the temperature--doping plane.
Our principal results for the sign reversed $s$-wave pairing SC, in terms of
the multicritical temperature, $T_c$, the phase separation/coexistence boundary
between the SDW and SC, $T^*$, and the boundary between C/IC SDW, $T_M^*$, are:
(a) IC-SDW and SC coexist for $T_c < T^*$ and phase separate otherwise, (b) SDW
takes the C form for $T_c>T_M^*$ and IC form for $T_c<T_M^*$, and (c) the
thermodynamic first order phase transition intervenes in between the C-SDW and
IC-SDW boundary for large $T_M^0$, where $T_M^0$ is the SDW transition
temperature at zero doping, $T^*=0.35 ~T_M^0$ and $T_M^*=0.56\ T_M^0$. The
intervention makes the phase diagram more complicated than previously reported.
By contrast no coexistence was found for the equal sign pairing SC. These
results will be compared with the experimental reports in the Fe pnictide
superconductors.

TinyOS, which addresses the constrains of the WSN nodes such as limited
processing power, memory, energy, etc and it uses the collection Tree Protocol
(CTP) to collect the data from the sensor nodes. It uses either the four-bit
link estimation or Link Estimation Exchange Protocol (LEEP) to predict the bi
directional quality of the wireless link between the nodes and the next hop
candidate is based on the estimated link quality. The residual energy of the
node is an important key factor, which plays a vital role in the lifetime of
the network and hence this has to taken as one of the metric in the parent
selection. In this work, we consider the remaining energy of the node as one of
the metric to decide the parent in addition to the link quality metrics. The
proposed protocol was compared with CTP protocol in terms of number of packets
forwarded by each node and packet reception ratio (PRR) of the network. This
work was simulated in TOSSIM simulator and the same was tested in Crossbow IRIS
radio test bed. The results show that our algorithm performs better than CTP in

In this paper an optimistic concurrency control strategy using on-demand

alternative for solving complex problems in the domain of communication
networks. This paper presents a random algorithm for handling the routing
problem in Mobile Ad hoc Networks [MANETS].The performance of most existing
routing protocols for MANETS degrades in terms of packet delay and congestion
caused as the number of mobile nodes increases beyond a certain level or their
speed passes a certain level. As the network becomes more and more dynamic,
congestion in network increases due to control packets generated by the routing
protocols in the process of route discovery and route maintenance. Most of this
congestion is due to flooding mechanism used in protocols like AODV and DSDV
for the purpose of route discovery and route maintenance or for route discovery
as in the case of DSR protocol. This paper introduces the concept of random
routing algorithm that neither maintains a routing table nor floods the entire
network as done by various known protocols thereby reducing the load on network
in terms of number of control packets in a highly dynamic scenario. This paper
calculates the expected run time of the designed random algorithm.

is a natural extension of the Plummer potential. The gravitational potential at
the position of particle i (x_i,y_i,z_i), induced by particle j at
(x_j,y_j,z_j), is given by: phi_ij = -G m_j/|r_ij^2+e_i^2+e_j^2|^1/2, where G
is the gravitational constant, m_j is the mass of particle j, r_ij =
|(x_i-x_j)^2+(y_i-y_j)^2+(z_i-z_j)^2|^1/2 and e_i and e_j are the gravitational
softening lengths of particles i and j, respectively. This form is formally an
extension of the Newtonian potential to five dimensions. The derivative of this
equation in the x,y, and z directions correspond to the gravitational
accelerations in these directions and these are always symmetric between two
particles.
  When one applies this potential to a group of particles with different
softening lengths, as is the case with a tree code, an averaged gravitational
softening length for the group can be used. We find that the most suitable
averaged softening length for a group of particles is <e_j^2> = sum_j^N m_j
e_j^2 / M, where M = sum_j^N m_j and N are the mass and number of all particles
in the group, respectively. The leading error related to the softening length
is O(sum_j r_j d(e_j^2)/r_ij^3), where r_j is the distance between particle j
and the center of mass of the group and d(e_j^2) = e_j^2 - <e_j^2>. Using this
averaged gravitational softening length with the tree method, one can use a
single tree to evaluate the gravitational forces for a system of particles with
a wide variety of gravitational softening lengths. Consequently, this will
reduce the calculation cost of the gravitational force for such a system with
different softenings without the need for complicated forms of softening. We
present the result of simple numerical tests. We found that our modification of
the Plummer potential works well.

on both user perception and network performances. To this aim, a new technique
called The HandOver Decision STAbility Technique (HODSTAT) is proposed for
horizontal handover in Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN) based on IEEE
802.11standard. HODSTAT is based on a hysteresis margin analysis that, combined
with a utilitybased function, evaluates the need for the handover and
determines if the handover is needed or avoided. Indeed, if a Mobile Terminal
(MT) only transiently hands over to a better network, the gain from using this
new network may be diminished by the handover overhead and short usage
duration. The approach that we adopt throughout this article aims at reducing
the minimum handover occurrence that leads to the interruption of network
connectivity (this is due to the nature of handover in WLAN which is a break
before make which causes additional delay and packet loss). To this end, MT
rather performs a handover only if the connectivity of the current network is
threatened or if the performance of a neighboring network is really better
comparing the current one with a hysteresis margin. This hysteresis should make
a tradeoff between handover occurrence and the necessity to change the current
network of attachment. Our extensive simulation results show that our proposed
algorithm outperforms other decision stability approaches for handover decision
algorithm.

applications is accompanied with high expectations for better quality of

the coexistence of future unlicensed users with existing licensed users is
becoming a challenging task in the next generation communication systems to
overcome the underutilization of the spectrum. A QoS and interference aware
resource allocation is thus of special interest in order to respond to the
heterogeneous constraints of the next generation networks. In this work, we
address the issue of resource allocation under heterogeneous constraints for
unlicensed multiband ultra-wideband (UWB) systems in the context of Future Home
Networks, i.e. the wireless personal area network (WPAN). The problem is first
studied analytically using a heterogeneous constrained optimization problem
formulation. After studying the characteristics of the optimal solution, we
propose a low-complexity suboptimal algorithm based on a cross-layer approach
that combines information provided by the PHY and MAC layers. While the PHY
layer is responsible for providing the channel quality of the unlicensed UWB
users as well as their interference power that they cause on licensed users,
the MAC layer is responsible for classifying the unlicensed users using a
two-class based approach that guarantees for multimedia services a
high-priority level compared to other services. Combined in an efficient and
simple way, the PHY and MAC information present the key elements of the aimed
resource allocation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme

it has numerous advantages, more exploration of the large-scale deployment

some time T, one of them will contribute to the overall asset, expecting, of
course, that it should be around 1/2 of the sum. Here we examine this question
within the classical Black and Scholes (BS) model, focusing on the evolution of
the probability density function P(w) of a random variable w =
a_T^{(1)}/(a_T^{(1)} + a_T^{(2)}) where a_T^{(1)} and a_T^{(2)} are the values
of two (either European- or the Asian-style) options produced by two absolutely
identical BS stochastic equations. We show that within the realm of the BS
model the behavior of P(w) is surprisingly different from common-sense-based
expectations. For the European-style options P(w) always undergoes a
transition, (when T approaches a certain threshold value), from a unimodal to a
bimodal form with the most probable values being close to 0 and 1, and,
strikingly, w =1/2 being the least probable value. This signifies that the
symmetry between two options spontaneously breaks and just one of them
completely dominates the sum. For path-dependent Asian-style options we observe
the same anomalous behavior, but only for a certain range of parameters.
Outside of this range, P(w) is always a bell-shaped function with a maximum at
w = 1/2.

show the importance of tilt angles for the reversal and build up of magnetic
flux at the poles which is, in turn, correlated with the strength of the next
cycle. Here we analyse time series of tilt angle measurements and look for a
possible relationship of the tilt angles with other solar cycle parameters, in
order to glean information on the solar dynamo and to estimate their potential
for predictions of solar activity. We employ tilt angle data from Mount Wilson
and Kodaikanal observatories covering solar cycles 15 to 21. We analyse the
latitudinal distribution of the tilt angles (Joy's law), their variation from
cycle to cycle and their relationship to other solar cycle parameters, such as
the strength, amplitude and length. The two main results are: 1. An
anti-correlation between the mean normalized tilt angle of a given cycle and
the strength (or amplitude) of that cycle, with a correlation coefficient of
r=-0.95 and r=-0.93 for Mount Wilson and Kodaikanal data, respectively. 2. The
product of the cycle averaged tilt angle and the strength of the same cycle
displays a significant correlation with the strength of the next cycle (r=0.65
and r=0.70 for Mount Wilson and Kodaikanal data, respectively). An even better
correlation is obtained between the source term of the poloidal flux in
Babcock-Leighton-type dynamos (which contains the tilt angle) and the amplitude

maximally Abelian gauge and the Gribov-Zwanziger action relying on functional
equations. The derivation and analysis of Dyson-Schwinger equations increase
considerably in complexity when going beyond the standard Landau gauge fixing
and the available tools have to be improved. For the derivation of the
equations a computer program (DoDSE) was developed in order to handle the
plethora of terms. The process of determining possible infrared solutions is
abstracted to obtain further insight into the structure of the so-called
infrared scaling solutions. It is found that a few simple steps suffice to
determine possible infrared scaling relations directly from the action. For the
maximally Abelian gauge an infrared enhanced diagonal gluon propagator is
found, while the off-diagonal degrees of freedom are infrared suppressed. This
is in agreement with the idea of Abelian infrared dominance. Furthermore, it is
proven that SU(2) and higher SU(N) have the same infrared behavior, although
the corresponding actions differ. Under a suitable truncation the
Dyson-Schwinger equations are solved in the deep infrared to obtain values for
the exponents of the power laws. Restricting the integration in field
configuration space to the Gribov region of the Landau gauge with the
Gribov-Zwanziger action leads to two qualitatively equivalent infrared
solutions. In both cases the gluon propagator is infrared suppressed and the
infrared enhanced ghost propagator dominates the Dyson-Schwinger equations.
This result corroborates the conjecture by Zwanziger that the functional
integration can be cut at the first Gribov horizon and only the applied
boundary conditions are important. For one solution the Dyson-Schwinger
equations reduce in the deep infrared exactly to those obtained with the usual
Faddeev-Popov gauge fixing.

were merged based on simple criteria of positional association and spectral
energy distribution (SED) consistency into a final catalog which contains only
coherent SEDs with counterparts in at least three adjacent Herschel bands.
These final source lists contain 528 entries for the l = 30\degr field, and 444
entries for the l = 59\degr field. The SED coverage has been augmented with
ancillary data at 24 $\mu$m and 1.1 mm. SED modeling for the subset of 318 and
101 sources (in the two fields, respectively) for which the distance is known
was carried out using both a structured star/disk/envelope radiative transfer
model and a simple isothermal grey-body. Global parameters like mass,
luminosity, temperature and dust properties have been estimated. The Lbol/Menv
ratio spans four orders of magnitudes from values compatible with the
pre-protostellar phase to embedded massive zero-age main sequence stars.
Sources in the l = 59\degr field have on average lower L/M, possibly outlining
an overall earlier evolutionary stage with respect to the sources in the l =

out freely by the unipolar generator induced electric field so that sparking on
polar cap can hardly occur. {\bf This problem could be solved within the
Partially Screened Gap (PSG) model in the regime of neutron stars}. However, in
this paper we extensively study this problem in a bare strange quark star (BSS)
model. We find that the huge potential barrier built by the electric field in
the vacuum gap above polar cap could usually prevent electrons from streaming
into the magnetosphere unless the electric potential of a pulsar is
sufficiently lower than that at infinite interstellar medium. Other processes,
such as the diffusion and thermionic emission of electrons have also been
included here. Our conclusions are as follows: both positive and negative
particles on a BSS's surface would be bound strongly enough to form a vacuum
gap above its polar cap as long as the BSS is not charged (or not highly
negative charged), and multi-accelerators could occur in a BSS's magnetosphere.

highly accurate energy density functionals, which allow to treat medium-heavy
nuclei. In this approach one tries to describe not only the ground state but
also the first relevant excited states. In general, higher accuracy requires a
larger set of parameters, which must be carefully chosen to avoid redundancy.
Following this line of development, it is unavoidable that the connection of
the functional with the bare nucleon-nucleon interaction becomes more and more
elusive. In principle, the construction of a density functional from a density
matrix expansion based on the effective nucleon-nucleon interaction is
possible, and indeed the approach has been followed by few authors. However, to
what extent a density functional based on such a microscopic approach can reach
the accuracy of the fully phenomenological ones remains an open question. A
related question is to establish which part of a functional can be actually
derived by a microscopic approach and which part, on the contrary, must be left
as purely phenomenological. In this paper we discuss the main problems that are
encountered when the microscopic approach is followed. To this purpose we will
use the method we have recently introduced to illustrate the different aspects
of these problems. In particular we will discuss the possible connection of the
density functional with the nuclear matter Equation of State and the distinct
features of finite size effects proper of nuclei.

surface brightnesses of satellite galaxies in the vicinity of these objects to
estimate their atomic gas content and to derive the average total mass of HI
gas contained in satellites as a function of projected radius from the primary.
Recent calibrations of merging timescales from N-body simulations are used to
estimate the rate at which this gas will accrete onto the primaries. Our
estimated accretion rates fall short of those needed to maintain the observed
level of star formation in these systems by nearly two orders of magnitude.
Nevertheless, there are strong correlations between the total mass of gas in
satellites and the colours and specific star formation rates of central
galaxies of all stellar masses. The correlations are much weaker if we consider
the total stellar mass in the satellites, rather than their total gas mass. We
ask why star formation in the central galaxies should be correlated with gas
contained in satellites at projected separations of a Mpc or more, well outside
the virial radius of the dark matter halos of these systems. We suggest that
gas-rich satellites trace an underlying reservoir of ionized gas that is
accreted continuously, and that provides the fuel for ongoing star formation in
galaxies in the local Universe.

narrow-band imaging reveals that a total of 4/123 Lya emitters (LAEs) are found

several important real-world systems. Frequently, it is a consequence of the
existence of a few long-range connections, which dominate the original regular
structure of the systems and implies each node to become accessible from other
nodes after a small number of steps, typically of order $\ell \propto \log N$.
However, this effect has been observed in pure-topological networks, where the
nodes have no spatial coordinates. In this paper, we present an alalogue of
small-world effect observed in real-world transportation networks, where the
nodes are embeded in a hree-dimensional space. Using the multidimensional
scaling method, we demonstrate how the addition of a few long-range connections
can suubstantially reduce the travel time in transportation systems. Also, we
investigated the importance of long-range connections when the systems are
under an attack process. Our findings are illustrated for two real-world
systems, namely the London urban network (streets and underground) and the US
highways network enhanced by some of the main US airlines routes.

verify with a photoionisation model that the physics of the narrow-line

deconvolution reveals two high-surface brightness regions in Tol 2240-384
separated by 2.4 kpc.The brightest southwestern region is surrounded by intense
ionised gas emission on a spatial scale of ~5 kpc. The profiles of the strong
emission lines in the UVES spectrum are asymmetric and all these lines apart
from Halpha and Hbeta can be fitted by two Gaussians of FWHM ~75-92 km/s
separated by ~80 km/s implying that there are two regions of ionised gas
emitting narrow lines. The shapes of the Halpha and Hbeta lines are more
complex. In particular, the Halpha emission line consists of two broad
components of FWHM ~700 km/s and 2300 km/s, in addition to narrow components of
two regions revealed from profiles of other lines. The extraordinarily high
luminosity of the broad Halpha line of 3x10e41 erg/s cannot be accounted for by
massive stars at different stages of their evolution. The broad Halpha emission
persists over a period of 7 years, which excludes supernovae as a powering
mechanism of this emission. This emission most likely arises from an accretion
disc around a black hole of mass ~10e7 Msun.

active participant in the cooling and shielding of the environment. The onset
of H2 formation therefore has a strong effect on the temperature and chemical
evolution in the post shock regions. We recently developed a model for H2
formation on a graphite surface in warm conditions. The graphite surface acts
as a model system for grains containing large areas of polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbon structures. Here this model is used to obtain a new description of
the H2 formation rate as a function of gas temperature that can be implemented
in molecular shock models. The H2 formation rate is substantially higher at
high gas temperatures as compared to the original implementation of this rate
in shock models, because of the introduction of H atoms which are chemically
bonded to the grain (chemisorption). Since H2 plays such a key role in the
cooling, the increased rate is found to have a substantial effect on the
predicted line fluxes of an important coolant in dissociative shocks [O I] at
63.2 and 145.5 micron. With the new model a better agreement between model and
observations is obtained. Since one of the goals of Herschel/PACS will be to
observe these lines with higher spatial resolution and sensitivity than the
former observations by ISO-LWS, this more accurate model is very timely to help
with the interpretation of these future results.

the morphological type or star formation rate, that affect the properties of
the galaxy as a whole. With the Herschel imaging capability from 70 to 500

Spectropolarimetric observations conducted in 2007, 2008 and 2009 respectively
with NARVAL@TBL and ESPaDOnS@CFHT reveal a clear Zeeman signature in the
average Stokes V profile, stable on timescales of days to months and slowly
increasing in amplitude on timescales of years. We speculate that this
timescale is the same as that on which Ha emission is varying and is equal to
the rotation period of the star. The corresponding longitudinal magnetic field,
measured during each of the three seasons, increases slowly from 100 to 150G,
implying that the polar strength of the putatively-dipolar large-scale magnetic
field of HD108 is at least 0.5kG and most likely of the order of 1-2 kG. The
stellar and wind properties are derived through a quantitative spectroscopic
analysis with the code CMFGEN. The effective temperature is difficult to
constrain because of the unusually strong HeI4471 and HeI5876 lines. Values in
the range 33000-37000 K are preferred. A mass loss rate of about 1e-7 Msun/yr
(with a clumping factor f=0.01) and a wind terminal velocity of 2000 km/s are
derived. The wind confinement parameter eta_star is larger than 100, implying
that the wind of HD108 is magnetically confined. Stochastic short-term
variability is observed in the wind-sensitive lines but not in the photospheric
lines, excluding the presence of pulsations. Material infall in the confined
wind is the most likely origin for lines formed in the inner wind.
Wind-clumping also probably causes part of the Ha variability. The projected
rotational velocity of HD108 is lower than 50 km/s, consistent with the
spectroscopic and photometric variation timescales of a few decades. Overall,
HD108 is very similar to the magnetic O star HD191612 except for an even slower
rotation.

by studying the most commonly used estimator, the realized covariance (RCV)

the observation frequency $n$ grow in the same rate, the limiting spectral
distribution (LSD) of RCV depends on the covolatility process not only through
the targeting ICV, but also on how the covolatility process varies in time. We
establish a Mar\v{c}enko--Pastur type theorem for weighted sample covariance
matrices, based on which we obtain a Mar\v{c}enko--Pastur type theorem for RCV
for a class $\mathcal{C}$ of diffusion processes. The results explicitly
demonstrate how the time variability of the covolatility process affects the
LSD of RCV. We further propose an alternative estimator, the time-variation
adjusted realized covariance (TVARCV) matrix. We show that for processes in

surroundings is key in determining how the radiation of the newly formed stars
interacts with the surrounds in a way that allows it to be used as a star
formation tracer. We present new Herschel/SPIRE 250, 350 and 500 mum data of
LHA 120-N44 and LHA 120-N63 in the LMC. We construct average spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) for annuli centered on the IR bright part of the star
formation sites. The annuli cover ~10-~100 pc. We use a phenomenological dust
model to fit these SEDs to derive the dust column densities, characterise the
incident radiation field and the abundance of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon
molecules. We see a factor 5 decrease in the radiation field energy density as
a function of radial distance around N63. N44 does not show a systematic trend.
We construct a simple geometrical model to derive the 3-D density profile of
the surroundings of these two regions. Herschel/SPIRE data have proven very
efficient in deriving the dust mass distribution. We find that the radiation
field in the two sources behaves very differently. N63 is more or less
spherically symmetric and the average radiation field drops with distance. N44
shows no systematic decrease of the radiation intensity which is probably due
to the inhomogeneity of the surrounding molecular material and to the complex
distribution of several star forming clusters in the region.

reached yet in many aspects. One is the role of van der Waals forces and
another the importance of mutual interactions between the adsorbing and the
adsorbed biomolecules ('critical crowding'). Here, a combined exeperimental and
theoretical approach is presented that fundamentally probes both aspects. On
three model proteins, lysozyme, {\alpha}-amylase and bovine serum albumin
(BSA), the adsorption kinetics is studied. Composite substrates are used
enabling a separation of the short- and the long-range forces. Though usually
neglected, experimental evidence is given for the influence of van der Waals
forces on the protein adsorption as revealed by in situ ellipsometry. The three
proteins were chosen for their different conformational stability in order to
investigate the influence of conformational changes on the adsorption kinetics.
Monte Carlo simulations are used to develop a model for these experimental
results by assuming an internal degree of freedom to represent conformational
changes. The simulations also provide data on the distribution of adsorption
sites. By in situ atomic force microscopy we can also test this distribution
experimentally which opens the possibility to e.g. investigate the interactions
between adsorbed proteins.

present in the simulation data, which we find it to be due to different halo
formation times. Early formation time haloes are, at the present epoch, more
spherical and have higher velocity dispersions than late forming-time haloes.
The halo shape-dynamics correlation, albeit weaker, survives the projection in
2D (ie., among projected shape and 1-D velocity dispersion). A similar
shape-dynamics correlation, independent of mass, is also found in the SDSS DR7
groups of galaxies and in order to investigate its cause we have tested and
used, as a proxy of the group formation time, a concentration parameter. We
have found, as in the case of the simulated haloes, that less concentrated
groups, corresponding to late formation times, have lower velocity dispersions
and higher elongations than groups with higher values of concentration,
corresponding to early formation times.

The logical reloading is a logical operation which replaces one system of basic

conception. However, generalizations of the conception are different for
different systems of basic concepts. It is conditioned by the fact, that some

framework that unifies the standard formalisms of special relativity and
quantum mechanics. The framework is based on Hilbert spaces H of functions of
four space-time variables x,t, furnished with an additional indefinite inner
product invariant under Poincar\'e transformations, and isomorphisms of these
spaces that preserve the indefinite metric. The indefinite metric is
responsible for breaking the symmetry between space and time variables and for
selecting a family of Hilbert subspaces that are preserved under Galileo
transformations. Within these subspaces the usual quantum mechanics with
Schr\""odinger evolution and t as the evolution parameter is derived.
Simultaneously, the Minkowski space-time is isometrically embedded into H,
Poincar\'e transformations have unique extensions to isomorphisms of H and the
embedding commutes with Poincar\'e transformations. The main new result is a
proof that the framework accommodates arbitrary pseudo-Riemannian space-times
furnished with the action of the diffeomorphism group.
