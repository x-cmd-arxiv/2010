IQP computations, and provide compelling evidence that the task of sampling
their output probability distributions is unlikely to be achievable by any
efficient classical means. More specifically we introduce the class post-IQP of
languages decided with bounded error by uniform families of IQP circuits with
post-selection, and prove first that post-IQP equals the classical class PP.
Using this result we show that if the output distributions of uniform IQP
circuit families could be classically efficiently sampled, even up to 41%
multiplicative error in the probabilities, then the infinite tower of classical
complexity classes known as the polynomial hierarchy, would collapse to its
third level. We mention some further results on the classical simulation
properties of IQP circuit families, in particular showing that if the output
distribution results from measurements on only O(log n) lines then it may in
fact be classically efficiently sampled.

compressive and exhibit a Gaussian distribution in the compressed heliosheath
plasma, whereas they follow a lognormal distribution in a nearly incompressible
supersonic solar wind plasma. To describe the evolution of magnetic field, we
develop a nonlinear simulation model of a partially ionized plasma based on two
dimensional time-dependent multifluid model. Our model self-consistently
describes solar wind plasma ions, electrons, neutrals and pickup ions. It is
found from our simulations that the magnetic field evolution is governed by
mode conversion process that leads to the suppression of vortical modes,
whereas the compressive modes are amplified. An implication of the mode
conversion process is to quench the Alfv\'enic interactions associated with the
vortical motions. Consequently anisotropic cascades are reduced. This is
accompanied by the amplification of compressional modes that tend to isotropize
the plasma fluctuations and lead to a Gaussian distribution of the magnetic
field.

framework via straightforward derivations of the EMP and NLS equations from a
simple linear combination of the relevant Einstein equations. By rewriting the
resulting expression in terms of the volume expansion factor and performing a
change of variables, we obtain an uncoupled EMP or NLS equation that is
independent of the imposition of additional conservation equations. Since the
correspondences shown here present an alternative route for obtaining exact
solutions to Einstein's equations, we reconstruct many known exact solutions
via their EMP or NLS counterparts and show by numerical analysis the stability

the latter induces no superconductivity in [Ba(1-x)Sr(x)]Fe2As2 in spite of the

becomes suppressed in BaFe2[As(1-x)P(x)]2 by a subtle reorganization of the
crystal structure, where arsenic and phosphorus are located at different
coordinates z(As), z(P). High-resolution X-ray diffraction experiments with
BaFe2[As(1-x)P(x)]2 single crystals reveal almost unchanged Fe-P bonds, but a
contraction of the Fe-As bonds, which remain nearly unchanged in
[Ba(1-x)Sr(x)]Fe2As2. Since the Fe-As bond length is a gauge for the magnetic
moment, our results show why the SDW is suppressed by P-, but not by Sr-doping.
Only the Fe-P interaction increases the width of the iron 3d bands, which
destabilizes the magnetic SDW ground state. The simultaneous contraction of the
Fe{As bonds is rather a consequence of the vanishing magnetism. Ordered
structure models of BaFe2[As(1-x)P(x)]2 obtained by DFT calculations agree
perfectly with the single-crystal X-ray structure determinations. The
contraction of the Fe-As bonds saturates at doping levels above x = 0.3, which
corrects the unreasonable linear decrease of the so-called pnictide height.

determinant of the metric and another measure $\Phi$ independent of the metric.
To implement scale invariance (S.I.), a dilaton field is introduced. Using the
first order formalism, curvature ( $\Phi R$ and $\sqrt{-g}R^{2}$ ) terms ,
gauge field term and dilaton kinetic terms are introduced in a conformally
invariant way. Exponential potentials for the dilaton break down (softly) the

of larger vacuum energy density, the gauge dynamics is normal, that is non

  ApJ, 731, 11",,"10.1088/0004-637X/731/1/11",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Using hydrodynamic simulations we compute the metal enrichment history of the
intergalactic medium (IGM). We show that galactic superwind (GSW) feedback can
transport metals to the IGM and that the properties of simulated metal
absorbers match observations. The distance of influence of GSW is typically
limited to >0.5Mpc and within regions of overdensity >10. Most CIV and OVI
absorbers are located within shocked regions of elevated temperature
(T>2x10^4K), overdensity (>10), and metallicity ([-2.5,-0.5]). OVI absorbers
have typically higher metallicity, lower density and higher temperature than
CIV absorbers. For OVI absorbers collisional ionization dominates over the
entire redshift range z=0-6, whereas for CIV absorbers the transition occurs at
moderate redshift z~3 from collisionally dominated to photoionization
dominated. We find that the observed column density distributions for CIV and
OVI in the range log N cm^2=12-15 are reasonably reproduced by the simulations.
The evolution of mass densities contained in CIV and OVI lines, Omega_CIV and
Omega_OVI, is also in good agreement with observations, which shows a near
constancy at low redshifts and an exponential drop beyond redshift z=3-4. For
both CIV and OVI, most absorbers are transient and the amount of metals probed
by CIV and OVI lines of column log N cm^2=12-15 is only ~2% of total metal
density at any epoch. While gravitational shocks from large-scale structure
formation dominate the energy budget (80-90%) for turning about 50% of IGM to
the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) by z=0, GSW feedback shocks are
energetically dominant over gravitational shocks at z > 1-2. Most of the
so-called ""missing metals"" at z=2-3 are hidden in a warm-hot (T=10^{4.5-7}K)
gaseous phase, heated up by GSW feedback shocks. Their mass distribution is
broadly peaked at $\delta=1-10$ in the IGM, outside virialized halos.

We show that a stochastic bistable switch forms a viable biochemical mechanism
to implement decision processes on long time scales. As a case study, the
mechanism is applied to model the initiation of follicle growth in mammalian
ovaries, where the physiological time scale of follicle pool depletion is on
the order of the organism's lifespan. We construct a simple mathematical model
for this process based on experimental evidence for the involved genetic
mechanisms. Despite the underlying stochasticity, the proposed mechanism turns
out to yield reliable behavior in large populations of cells subject to the

constant may emerge from the intrinsic stochasticity of the underlying gene
regulatory network. Apart from ovarian follicles, the proposed mechanism may
also be of relevance for other physiological systems where cells take binary

Herschel at 100 and 160 um in the GOODS-N, as part of the PACS Evolutionary
Probe (PEP) survey, to derive for the first time the evolution of the
rest-frame 60-um, 90-um, and total IR luminosity functions (LFs) of galaxies
and AGNs from z=0 to unprecedented high redshifts (z~2-3). The PEP LFs were
computed using the 1/Vmax method. The FIR sources were classified by means of a
detailed broad- band SED-fitting analysis and spectral characterisation. Based
on the best-fit model results, k-correction and total IR (8-1000 um) luminosity
were obtained for each source. LFs (monochromatic and total) were then derived
for various IR populations separately in different redshift bins and compared
to backward evolution model predictions. We detect strong evolution in the LF
to at least z~2. Objects with SEDs similar to local spiral galaxies are the
major contributors to the star formation density (SFD) at z< 0.3, then, as
redshift increases, moderate SF galaxies - most likely containing a
low-luminosity AGN - start dominating up to z ~= 1.5. At >1.5 the SFD is
dominated by the contributions of starburst galaxies. In agreement with
previous findings, the comoving IR LD derived from our data evolves
approximately as (1 + z)^(3.8+/-0.3) up to z~1, there being some evidence of
flattening up to z~2.

suggesting to estimate these high quantiles parameterically using, e.g. GPDs.

resistive electrodes in micropattern gaseous detectors with the aim to combine
in the same design the best features of RPCs (for the example, their robustness
and spark protection property) with the high granularity and thus the good
position resolution offered by microelectronic technology. In the stream of
this activity, we have recently developed two novel detectors with resistive
electrodes: one was based on resistive micromeshes and the second one is a MSGC
with resistive electrodes. We have demonstrated that the resistive meshes are a
convenient construction element for various designs of spark protective
detectors: RPCs type, GEM type and MICROMEGAS type. These new detectors enable
to considerably enhance the RPC and micropattern detectors applications since
they feature not only a high position resolution but also a relatively good
energy resolution (25-30 persent FWHM at 6 keV) and, if necessary, they can
operate in cascaded mode allowing the achievement of a high overall gas gain.
The main conclusion from these studies is that the implementation of resistive
electrodes in micropattern detectors makes them fully spark protected; on this
basis we consider this direction very promising.

the laminar-turbulent boundary which instead focuses on their typical

considering the fully nonlinear transient growth problem to estimate both the

nonlinear optimal disturbance which outgrows the well-known linear optimal for
the same initial energy and is crucially much more efficient in triggering
turbulence. The conclusion is then that the most dangerous disturbance can
differ markedly from what traditional linear transient growth analysis
predicts.

mechanisms underlying the formation of these foci and the resulting topological
order of the chromosome remain to be elucidated. Here we consider a
thermodynamic framework based on a worm-like chain model of chromosomes where
sparse designated sites along the DNA are able to interact whenever they are
spatially close-by. This is motivated by recurrent evidence that there exists
physical interactions between genes that operate together. Three important
results come out of this simple framework. First, the resulting formation of
transcription foci can be viewed as a micro-phase separation of the interacting
sites from the rest of the DNA. In this respect, a thermodynamic analysis
suggests transcription factors to be appropriate candidates for mediating the
physical interactions between genes. Next, numerical simulations of the polymer
reveal a rich variety of phases that are associated with different topological
orderings, each providing a way to increase the local concentrations of the
interacting sites. Finally, the numerical results show that both
one-dimensional clustering and periodic location of the binding sites along the
DNA, which have been observed in several organisms, make the spatial
co-localization of multiple families of genes particularly efficient.

correspond to two of these invariant classes. The more degenerate class is the
set of product metrics which are also studied from an invariant point of view.

brings novel insight to the role of chirality in weak interactions. We
demonstrate the latter role by considering an action for a generalized spinor

extra index $i$ running over four ideals. The covariant derivative of

nonlinearities appear, leading to a quantum phase transition from Mott to

polariton quasiparticles as appropriate linear combinations of both particle

Nebula). This is an evolved planetary nebula with a central star that is
currently on the cooling track, due to which the outer parts of the nebula are
recombining. From the PACS and SPIRE images we conclude that there is a
striking resemblance between the dust distribution and the H2 emission, which
appears to be observational evidence that H2 forms on grain surfaces. We have
developed a photoionization model of the nebula with the Cloudy code which we
used to determine the physical conditions of the dust and investigate possible
formation scenarios for the H2. We conclude that the most plausible scenario is
that the H2 resides in high density knots which were formed after the
recombination of the gas started when the central star entered the cooling
track. Hydrodynamical instabilities due to the unusually low temperature of the
recombining gas are proposed as a mechanism for forming the knots. H2 formation
in the knots is expected to be substantial after the central star underwent a
strong drop in luminosity about one to two thousand years ago, and may still be
ongoing at this moment, depending on the density of the knots and the
properties of the grains in the knots.

structures representing the initial conditions for star formation. The study
presented here aims to construct and analyze accurate column density and dust
temperature maps of IRDCs by using the first Herschel data from the Hi-GAL
galactic plane survey. These fundamental quantities, are essential for
understanding processes such as fragmentation in the early stages of the
formation of stars in molecular clouds. We have developed a simple
pixel-by-pixel SED fitting method, which accounts for the background emission.
By fitting a grey-body function at each position, we recover the spatial
variations in both the dust column density and temperature within the IRDCs.
This method is applied to a sample of 22 IRDCs exhibiting a range of angular
sizes and peak column densities. Our analysis shows that the dust temperature
decreases significantly within IRDCs, from background temperatures of 20-30 K
to minimum temperatures of 8-15 K within the clouds, showing that dense
molecular clouds are not isothermal. Temperature gradients have most likely an
important impact on the fragmentation of IRDCs. Local temperature minima are
strongly correlated with column density peaks, which in a few cases reach NH2 =
1 x 10^{23} cm^{-2}, identifying these clouds as candidate massive prestellar
cores. Applying this technique to the full Hi-GAL data set will provide
important constraints on the fragmentation and thermal properties of IRDCs, and
help identify hundreds of massive prestellar core candidates.

chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on Ni foils. We demonstrates that the
precipitation mechanism may not be the only important mechanism in the
formation of graphene by CVD in Ni system, and that controlling the cooling
rate in the CVD process may not be the appropriate way to control the thickness
of graphene films. In addition, we are the first to demonstrate the transfer of
centimeter-scale FLG from Ni foil to transparent flexible polyethylene
terephthalate substrates via an efficient roll-to-roll process. Comparing to
rigid substrates, synthesis of graphene on flexible Ni foil has necessity for
the use of a roll-to-roll transfer process.

far-infrared spectral line emissions from two lensed, ultra-luminous infrared
galaxies at high redshift: MIPS J142824.0+352619 (MIPS J1428), a
starburst-dominated system at z = 1.3, and IRAS F10214+4724 (F10214), a source
at z = 2.3 hosting both star-formation and a luminous AGN. We have detected
[OI]63 micron and [OIII]52 micron in MIPS J1428, and tentatively [OIII]52
micron in F10214. Together with the recent ZEUS-CSO [CII]158 micron detection
in MIPS J1428 we can for the first time combine [OI], [CII] and far-IR (FIR)
continuum measurements for photo-dissociation (PDR) modeling of an
ultra-luminous (L_IR > 10^12 L_sun) star forming galaxy at the peak epoch of
cosmic star formation. We find that MIPS J1428, contrary to average local
ULIRGs, does not show a deficit in [OI] relative to FIR. The combination of
far-UV flux G_0 and gas density n (derived from the PDR models), as well as the
star formation efficiency (derived from CO and FIR) is similar to normal or
starburst galaxies, despite the high infrared luminosity of this system. In
contrast, F10214 has stringent upper limits on [OIV] and [SIII], and an
[OIII]/FIR ratio at least an order of magnitude lower than local starbursts or
AGN, similar to local ULIRGs.

galaxy parameters, such as its total mass and the mass locked in stars.
Therefore, the study of the evolution of this relation in the optical and
infrared bands can provide valuable information about the evolution of the
individual galaxies through the changes found in each band. This work aims to
study the TFR at high redshift in the B, V, R, I, and K-bands by comparison
with the local relations derived from a large sample of galaxies in the
redshift range 0.1<z<0.3, processed in the same way, and with the same
instrumental constraints that the high-redshift sample. Using the large
photometric information available in the AEGIS database, we have studied the
best procedure to obtain reliable k-corrections. Instrumental magnitudes are
then k and extinction corrected and the absolute magnitudes derived, using the
concordance cosmological model. The rotational velocities have been obtained
from the widths of optical lines using DEEP2 spectra. Finally, morphology has
been determined via visual classification of the HST images. We detect
evolution in the B, V and R-band TFRs in the sense that galaxies were brighter
in the past for the same rotation velocity. The change in luminosity is more
noticeable in the bluer bands. This colour evolution, unnoticed in our previous
work (Fern\'andez Lorenzo et al. 2009) has been detected thanks to the more
reliable k-corrections carried out in this paper, which included photometry
from B to IRAC bands. The change in the (V-K) and (R-I) colours (for a fixed
velocity) could be interpreted as an ageing of the stellar populations as
consequence of the star formation decrease since z=1.25. In addition, we
conclude that spiral galaxies could have doubled their stellar masses in the
last 8.6 Gyr.

cluster of transcript (EST, mRNA) data do not exhibit the time and space
efficiency necessary to process large clusters of over than 20,000 ESTs and
genes longer than 1Mb. Guaranteeing both accuracy and efficiency seems to be a
computational goal quite far to be achieved, since accuracy is strictly related
to exploiting the inherent redundancy of information present in a large
cluster. We propose a fast method for the problem that combines two ideas: a
novel algorithm of proved small time complexity for computing spliced
alignments of a transcript against a genome, and an efficient algorithm that
exploits the inherent redundancy of information in a cluster of transcripts to
select, among all possible factorizations of EST sequences, those allowing to
infer splice site junctions that are highly confirmed by the input data. The
EST alignment procedure is based on the construction of maximal embeddings that
are sequences obtained from paths of a graph structure, called Embedding Graph,
whose vertices are the maximal pairings of a genomic sequence T and an EST P.
The procedure runs in time linear in the size of P, T and of the output.
PIntron, the software tool implementing our methodology, is able to process in
a few seconds some critical genes that are not manageable by other gene
structure prediction tools. At the same time, PIntron exhibits high accuracy
(sensitivity and specificity) when compared with ENCODE data. Detailed
experimental data, additional results and PIntron software are available at

(1) invention-to-imitation ratio, iLeader, which measures how often an agent
invents, and (2) rate of conceptual change, cLeader, which measures how
creative an invention is. High iLeader increased mean fitness of ideas, but
only when creativity of followers was low. High iLeader was associated with

cLeader increased mean fitness of ideas in the early stage of idea generation;
in the later stage it decreased idea fitness. Reasons for these findings and

superwinds, in the Very Nearby Galaxy Survey with Herschel. In addition, its
interaction with the M81 group has stripped a significant portion of its
interstellar medium from its disk. SPIRE maps now afford better
characterization of the far-infrared emission from cool dust outside the disk,
and sketch a far more complete picture of its mass distribution and energetics
than previously possible. They show emission coincident in projection with the
starburst wind and in a large halo, much more extended than the PAH band
emission seen with Spitzer. Some complex substructures coincide with the
brightest PAH filaments, and others with tidal streams seen in atomic hydrogen.
We subtract the far-infrared emission of the starburst and underlying disk from
the maps, and derive spatially-resolved far-infrared colors for the wind and
halo. We interpret the results in terms of dust mass, dust temperature, and
global physical conditions. In particular, we examine variations in the dust
physical properties as a function of distance from the center and the wind
polar axis, and conclude that more than two thirds of the extraplanar dust has
been removed by tidal interaction, and not entrained by the starburst wind.

interacting particle system, whose components are driven by independent
diffusion processes with values in an open subset of $\mathds{R}^d$, $d\geq 1$.
The interaction occurs when a particle hits the boundary: it jumps to a
position chosen with respect to a probability measure depending on the position
of the whole system. Then we study the behavior of such a system when the
number of particles goes to infinity. This leads us to an approximation method
for the Yaglom limit of multi-dimensional diffusion processes with unbounded
drift defined on an unbounded open set. While most of known results on such
limits are obtained by spectral theory arguments and are concerned with
existence and uniqueness problems, our approximation method allows us to get
numerical values of quasi-stationary distributions, which find applications to
many disciplines. We end the paper with numerical illustrations of our
approximation method for stochastic processes related to biological population
models.

Nitroxide-Mediated Polymerization (NMP), consists to bind covalently the
alkoxyamine, which acts as initiator controller agent, at the silica
nanoparticles surface in two steps. The first step is a reaction between the
aminopropylsilane and the silica particles in order to functionalize the
particles surface with amino group. In a second step, the
initiating-controlling alkoxyamine moiety is introduced via an over grafting
reaction between the amino group and the N-hydroxysuccinimide based MAMA-SG1
activated ester. To simplify both their chemical transformation and the
polymerization step, the native silica particles, initially dispersed in water,
have been transferred in an organic solvent, the dimethylacetamide, which is
also a good solvent for the polystyrene. The synthesis parameters have been
optimized for grafting density, conversion rates, and synthesis reproducibility
while keeping the colloidal stability and to avoid any aggregation of silica
particles induced by the inter-particles interaction evolution during the
synthesis. After synthesis, the final grafted objects have been purified and
the non-grafted polymer chains formed in the solvent have been washed out by
ultra filtration. Then the particles have been studied using Small angle
Neutron Scattering (SANS) coupled to neutron contrast variation method. To
optimize the contrast conditions, both hydrogenated and deuterated monomers
have been used for the synthesis. A refined fitting analysis based on the
comparison on two models, a basic core-shell and the Gaussian Pedersen model,
enables us to fit nicely the experimental data for both the hydrogenated and
deuterated grafted case. Differences are seen between grafting of normal or
deuterated chains which can be due to monomer reactivity or to neutron contrast
effect variations. The synthesis and the characterization method established in
this work constitute a robust and reproducible way to design well defined
grafted polymer nanoparticles. These objects will be incorporated in polymer
matrices in a further step to create Nanocomposites for polymer reinforcement.

lysozyme-pectin complexes depending on the charge density. Lysozyme is a
globular protein and pectin a natural anionic semiflexible polysaccharide with
a degree of methylation (DM) 0, 43 and 74. For our experimental conditions
(buffer ionic strength I = 2.5 10-2 mol/L and pH between 3 and 7), the
electrostatic charge of lysozyme is always positive (from 8 to 17 depending on
pH). The pectin charge per elementary chain segment is negative and can be
varied from almost zero to one through the change of DM and pH. The weight
molar ratio of lysozyme on pectin monomers is kept constant. The ratio of
negative charge content per volume to positive charge content per volume, -/+,
is varied between 10 and 0.007. On a local scale, for all charged pectins, a
correlation peak appears at 0.2 {\AA}-1 due to proteins clustering inside the
complexes. On a large scale, the complexes appear as formed of spherical
globules with a well defined radius of 10 to 50 nm, containing a few thousands
proteins. The volume fraction Phi of organic matter within the globules derived
from SANS absolute cross-sections is around 0.1. The protein stacking, which
occurs inside the globules, is enhanced when pectin is more charged, due to pH
or DM. The linear charge density of the pectin determines the size of the
globules for pectin chains of comparable molecular weights whether it is
controlled by the pH or the DM. The radius of the globules varies between 10 nm
and 50 nm. In conclusion the structure is driven by electrostatic interactions
and not by hydrophobic interactions. The molecular weight also has a large
influence on the structure of the complexes since long chains tend to form
larger globules. This maybe one reason why DM and pH are not completely
equivalent in our system since DM 0 has a short mass, but this may not be the

conformation of a polymer corona grafted around silica nano-particles dispersed
inside a nanocomposite, a matrix of the same polymer. This measurement
constitutes an experimental breakthrough based on a refined combination of
chemical synthesis, which permits to match the contribution of the neutron
silica signal inside the composite, and the use of complementary scattering
methods SANS and SAXS to extract the grafted polymer layer form factor from the
inter-particles silica structure factor. The modelization of the signal of the
grafted polymer on nanoparticles inside the matrix and the direct comparison
with the form factor of the same particles in solution show a clear-cut change
of the polymer conformation from bulk to the nanocomposite: a transition from a
stretched and swollen form in solution to a Gaussian conformation in the matrix
followed with a compression of a factor two of the grafted corona. In the
probed range, increasing the interactions between the grafted particles (by
increasing the particle volume fraction) or between the grafted and the free
matrix chains (decreasing the grafted-free chain length ratio) does not
influence the amplitude of the grafted brush compression. This is the first
direct observation of the wet-to-dry conformational transition theoretically
expected to minimize the free energy of swelling of grafted chains in
interaction with free matrix chains, illustrating the competition between the
mixing entropy of grafted and free chains, and the elastic deformation of the
grafted chains. In addition to the experimental validation of the theoretical
prediction, this result constitutes a new insight for the nderstanding of the
general problem of dispersion of nanoparticles inside a polymer matrix for the
design of new nanocomposites materials.

star formation in its surroundings. Previous work has shown that it displays a
bubble morphology at mid-infrared wavelengths and has a massive layer of
collected neutral material seen at sub-mm wavelengths. Given the well-defined
photo-dissociation region (PDR) boundary and collected layer, it is an
excellent laboratory to study the ""collect and collapse"" process of triggered
star formation. Using Herschel Space Observatory data at 100, 160, 250, 350,
and 500 micron, in combination with Spitzer and APEX-LABOCA data, we can for
the first time map the entire spectral energy distribution of an HII region at
high angular resolution. Aims. We seek a better understanding of RCW120 and its
local environment by analysing its dust temperature distribution. Additionally,
we wish to understand how the dust emissivity index, beta, is related to the
dust temperature. Methods. We determine dust temperatures in selected regions
of the RCW 120 field by fitting their spectral energy distribution (SED),
derived using aperture photometry. Additionally, we fit the SED extracted from
a grid of positions to create a temperature map. Results. We find a gradient in
dust temperature, ranging from >30 K in the interior of RCW 120, to ~20K for
the material collected in the PDR, to ~10K toward local infrared dark clouds
and cold filaments. Our results suggest that RCW 120 is in the process of
destroying the PDR delineating its bubble morphology. The leaked radiation from
its interior may influence the creation of the next generation of stars. We
find support for an anti-correlation between the fitted temperature and beta,
in rough agreement with what has been found previously. The extended wavelength
coverage of the Herschel data greatly increases the reliability of this result.

from the Strong Lensing Legacy Survey (SL2S). We combine strong lensing
modeling and dynamical constraints. The strong lensing analysis is based on
multi-band HST/ACS observations exhibiting strong lensing features that we have
followed-up spectroscopically with VLT/FORS2. To constrain the scale radius of
an NFW mass profile that cannot be constrained by strong lensing, we propose a
new method by taking advantage of the large-scale dynamical information
provided by VLT/FORS2 and KECK/LRIS spectroscopy of group members. In constrast
to other authors, we show that the observed lensing features in
SL2S\,J02140-0535 belong to different background sources: one at $z$ = 1.7
$\pm$ 0.1 produces three images, while the other at $z$ = 1.023 $\pm$ 0.001 has
only a single image. Our unimodal NFW mass model reproduces these images very
well. It is characterized by a concentration parameter $c_{200}$ = 6.0 $\pm$
0.6, which is slightly greater than the value expected from $\Lambda$CDM
simulations for a mass of M$_{200}$ $\approx$ 1 $\times$ 10$^{14}$ M$_{\sun}$.
The spectroscopic analysis of group members also reveals a unimodal structure
that exhibits no evidence of merging. We compare our dynamic mass estimate with
an independent weak-lensing based mass estimate finding that both are
consistent. Our combined lensing and dynamical analysis of SL2S\,J02140-0535
demonstrates the importance of spectroscopic information in reliably
identifying the lensing features. Our findings argue that the system is a
relaxed, massive galaxy group where mass is traced by light. This work shows a
potentially useful method for constraining large-scale properties inaccessible
to strong lensing, such as the scale radius of the NFW profile.

studied in the literature, and several structural tractability results have

computation problem where the focus is either on finding one solution, or on
enumerating all solutions, possibly projected to some given set of output
variables. The paper investigates the structural tractability of the problem of
enumerating (possibly projected) solutions, where tractability means here
computable with polynomial delay (WPD), since in general exponentially many
solutions may be computed. A general framework based on the notion of tree
projection of hypergraphs is considered, which generalizes all known
decomposition methods. Tractability results have been obtained both for classes
of structures where output variables are part of their specification, and for
classes of structures where computability WPD must be ensured for any possible
set of output variables. These results are shown to be tight, by exhibiting
dichotomies for classes of structures having bounded arity and where the tree
decomposition method is considered.

of larger aperture telescopes, more sensitive detectors and broader wavelength

fulfilling the needs when phenomena related to the formation of black holes

Recently, mainly through the Vela, Beppo-SAX and Swift satellites, we reached a
reasonable knowledge of the most violent events in the Universe and of some of
the processes we believe are leading to the formation of black holes (BH). We
plan to open a new window of opportunity to study the variegated physics of
very fast astronomical transients, particularly the one related to extreme
compact objects. The innovative approach is based on three cornerstones: 1) the
design (the conceptual design has been already completed) of a 3m robotic
telescope and related focal plane instrumentation characterized by the unique
features: ""No telescope points faster""; 2) simultaneous multi-wavelengths
observations (photometry, spectroscopy o\& polarimetry); 3) high time
resolution observations. The conceptual design of the telescope and related
instrumentation is optimized to address the following topics: High frequency
a-periodic variability, Polarization, High z GRBs, Short GRBs, GRB-Supernovae
association, Multi-wavelengths simultaneous photometry and rapid low dispersion
spectroscopy. This experiment will turn the ""exception"" (like the optical

for various selection effects and for the extragalactic variable population of

these sources are much more highly variable than extragalactic objects; more

variable sources increases toward the Galactic center (another indication that
this is a Galactic population), and that the spectral indices of many of these
sources are flat or inverted. A small number of the variables are coincident
with mid-IR sources and two are coincident with X-ray emitters, but most have
no known counterparts at other wavelengths. Intriguingly, one lies at the
center of a supernova remnant, while another appears to be a very compact
planetary nebula; several are likely to represent activity associated with star

strongly affected when nanoconfined as a thin film and specifically its glass
transition temperature (Tg) is reported to decrease with decreasing film
thickness. Tremendous effort has been dedicated to developing methods for
quantifying the large-scale dynamic of nanoconfined polymers: film dewetting,
film contraction, nanobubble inflation, nanoparticle imbedding and healing of
deformed surfaces etc. In this work we describe a novel method to study the
large scale dynamic and nanomechanical properties of nanoconfined polymers in
nanoparticles in nanoblends. Nanoblends of dPS/PBMA were prepared from a
mixture of colloidal suspensions of cross-linked PBMA and traces of dPS
nanoparticles via water evaporation. The polymer blends were prepared at
temperatures well below the glass transition of PS (TgPS) and above the Tg of
cross-linked PBMA particles (TgPBMA). In these conditions we expect the PBMA
particles to deform under capillary pressure to fill the interstices between
them and the glassy PS nanoparticles to remain spherical. During the
preparation of the nanoblends the elastic energy is stored within the deformed
cross-linked PBMA nanoparticles. Upon annealing the films above TgPS, the PBMA
nanoparticles regain their spherical shape and release the stored elastic
energy, which induces the deformation of the PS nanoparticles. Small angle
neutron scattering is then used to monitor the shape evolution of the PS
nanoparticles and to quantify the relaxation dynamics of the polystyrene
nanoparticles.

complexes of pectin and a globular protein, napin, have been investigated with
a ""Foamscan"" apparatus. Complementary, we also used SANS with a recent method
consisting in an analogy between the SANS by foams and the neutron reflectivity
of films to measure in situ film thickness of foams. The effect of ionic
strength, of protein concentration and of charge density of the pectin has been
analysed. Whereas the foam stability is improved for samples containing soluble
complexes, no effect has been noticed on the foam film thickness, which is
almost around 315 {\AA} whatever the samples. These results let us specify the
role of each specie in the mixture: free proteins contribute to the foaming
capacity, provided the initial free protein content in the bulk is sufficient
to allow the foam formation, and soluble complexes slow down the drainage by
their presence in the Plateau borders, which finally results in the
stabilisation of foams.

force-clamp spectroscopy (FCS) of reversibly bonded systems. FCS offers the
unique possibility to vary the equilibrium constant in two-state kinetics, for
instance the unfolding and refolding of biomolecules, over many orders of
magnitude due to the force dependency of the respective rates. We discuss two
different kinds of counting statistics, the event-counting usually employed in
the statistical analysis of two-state kinetics and additionally the so-called
cycle-counting. While in the former case all transitions are counted,
cycle-counting means that we focus on one type of transitions. This might be
advantageous in particular if the equilibrium constant is much larger or much
smaller than unity because in these situations the temporal resolution of the
experimental setup might not allow to capture all transitions of an
event-counting analysis. We discuss how an analysis of FCS data for complex
systems exhibiting dynamic disorder might be performed yielding information
about the detailed force-dependence of the transition rates and about the time
scale of the dynamic disorder. In addition, the question as to which extent the
kinetic scheme can be viewed as a Markovian two-state model is discussed.

This process may be important to the formation of massive stars but has never

Herschel Infrared survey of the Galactic plane, Hi-GAL, to perform this study.
We combine the Spitzer-GLIMPSE and -MIPSGAL, radio-continuum and sub-millimeter
surveys such as ATLASGAL with Hi-GAL to study Young Stellar Objects (YSOs)
observed towards Galactic HII regions. We select a representative HII region,
N49, located in the field centered on l=30 degr observed as part of the Hi-GAL
Science Demonstration Phase, to demonstrate the importance Hi-GAL will have to
this field of research. Hi-GAL PACS and SPIRE images reveal a new population of
embedded young stars, coincident with bright ATLASGAL condensations. The Hi-GAL
images also allow us, for the first time, to constrain the physical properties
of the newly formed stars by means of fits to their spectral energy
distribution. Massive young stellar objects are observed at the borders of the
N49 region and represent second generation massive stars whose formation has
been triggered by the expansion of the ionized region. Hi-GAL enables us to
detect a population of young stars at different evolutionary stages, cold
condensations only being detected in the SPIRE wavelength range. The far IR
coverage of Hi-GAL strongly constrains the physical properties of the YSOs. The
large and unbiased spatial coverage of this survey offers us a unique
opportunity to lead, for the first time, a global study of star formation
triggered by HII regions in our Galaxy.

70- and 160-micrometers filters, and spectra covering several H2O rotational
lines. Spectra in the range 450-1550 GHz were acquired with SPIRE. The comet
emission continuum from 70 to 672 micrometers was measured, but no lines were
detected. The spectral energy distribution indicates thermal emission from
large particles and provides a measure of the size distribution index and dust
production rate. The upper limit to the water production rate is compared to
the production rates of other species (CO, CH3OH, HCN, H2S, OH) measured with
the IRAM 30-m and Nancay telescopes. The coma is found to be strongly enriched
in species more volatile than water, in comparison to comets observed closer to
the Sun. The CO to H2O production rate ratio exceeds 220%. The dust to gas
production rate ratio is on the order of 1.

quality XMM-Newton EPIC and RGS data were analysed, as well as Swift/XRT and
BAT and INTEGRAL IBIS/ISGRI data, in order to cover the 0.3--110 keV energy
range. For ESO 140-43 also XMM-Newton/OM and Swift/UVOT data were used. We
studied the variability of the three AGN on a time-scale of seconds using the
EPIC/PN light curves, and the long-term time-scale variability of ESO 140-43
using two observations performed 6 months apart by XMM-Newton. The spectra of
the three Seyfert galaxies present a ""soft excess'' at energies E < 2 keV above
a power-law continuum that can be modeled by complex absorption, without any
additional emission component. The X-ray sources in UGC 3142 and ESO 383-18 are
absorbed by two layers of neutral material, with covering fractions f_1=0.92
and f_2=0.57 for UGC 3142, and f_1=0.97 and f_2 = 0.86 for ESO 383-18. While
the clumpy absorber could be part of a disc wind or of the broad line region
for UGC 3142, in the case of ESO 383-18 a clumpy torus plus Compton thin dust
lanes are more likely. The spectra of ESO 140-43 can be well fitted using a
power law absorbed by three clumpy ionized absorbers with different covering
factors, column densities, and ionization parameters, likely part of a moving
clumpy system, which might be a disc wind or the broad line region. The strong
spectral and flux variability on a time scale of 6 months seen in ESO 140-43 is
likely due to changes in the moving absorbers. The variation of the covering
factor of one of the three ionized absorbers could be detected, on a
kilo-seconds time-scale, in the EPIC light-curve of ESO 140-43.
