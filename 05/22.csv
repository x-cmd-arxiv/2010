three brane that fluctuates into higher dimensions. For this we interpret the
Yang-Mills theory as a higher dimensional bulk gravity theory with dynamics
that is governed by the Einstein action, and with a metric tensor constructed
from the gauge field in a manner that displays the original gauge symmetry as
an isometry. The brane moves in this higher dimensional space-time under the
influence of its bulk gravity, with dynamics determined by the Nambu action.
This introduces the desired interaction between the brane and the gauge field
in a way that preserves the original gauge invariance as an isometry of the
induced metric. After a prudent change of variables the result can be
interpreted as a gauge invariant and massive vector field that propagates in
the original space-time $\mathbb R^4$: The presence of the brane becomes
entirely invisible, except for the mass.

analysis supports a very general picture of the charging and heating dynamics

several applications of free-electron lasers. First, up to a certain photon
flux, ionization proceeds as a series of direct photoemission events producing

this transition is presented. Third, in contrast to the behavior in the
infrared or low vacuum ultraviolet range, the nanoplasma energy capture
proceeds via {\it ionization heating}, i.e., inner photoionization of localized
electrons, whereas collisional heating of conduction electrons is negligible up
to high laser intensities. A direct consequence of the latter is a surprising
evolution of the mean energy of emitted electrons as function of laser

by smart environments but they are particularly useful in unattended situations
where terrain, climate and other environmental constraints may hinder in the
deployment of wired/conventional networks. Unlike traditional networks, these
sensor networks do not have a continuous power supply at their disposal. Rather
the individual sensors are battery operated and the lifetime of the individual
sensors and thus the overall network depend heavily on duty cycle of these
sensors. Analysis on WSNs shows that communication module is the main part
which consumes most of the sensor energy and that is why energy conservation is
the major optimization goal. Since routing protocols and MAC protocols directly
access the communication module therefore the design of protocols in these two
domains should take into account the energy conservation goal. In this paper,
we discuss different state-of-the-art protocols both in MAC and routing domains
that have been proposed for WSNs to achieve the overall goal of prolonging the
network lifetime. The routing protocols in WSNs are generally categorized into
three groups - data centric, hierarchical and location-based but we focus on
only the first two categories because location-based routing protocols
generally require a prior knowledge about sensors location which most of the
times is not available due to random deployment of the sensors. We then discuss
how schedule-based and contention-based MAC protocols can contribute to achieve
optimal utilization of the limited energy resource by avoiding or reducing the
chances of collisions and thus the need for retransmission.

long Gamma-Ray bursts (LGRBs) using a galaxy catalogue constructed from the
Millennium Simulation. We developed an LGRB synthetic model based on the
hypothesis that these events originate at the end of the life of massive stars
following the collapsar model, with the possibility of including a constraint
on the metallicity of the progenitor star. A complete observability pipeline
was designed to calculate a probability estimation for a galaxy to be
observationally identified as a host for LGRBs detected by present
observational facilities. This new tool allows us to build an observable host
galaxy catalogue which is required to reproduce the current stellar mass
distribution of observed hosts. This observability pipeline predicts that the
minimum mass for the progenitor stars should be ~75 solar masses in order to be
able to reproduce BATSE observations. Systems in our observable catalogue are
able to reproduce the observed properties of host galaxies, namely stellar
masses, colours, luminosity, star formation activity and metallicities as a
function of redshift. At z>2, our model predicts that the observable host
galaxies would be very similar to the global galaxy population. We found that
~88 per cent of the observable host galaxies with mean gas metallicity lower
than 0.6 solar have stellar masses in the range 10^8.5-10^10.3 solar masses in
excellent agreement with observations. Interestingly, in our model observable
host galaxies remain mainly within this mass range regardless of redshift,
since lower stellar mass systems would have a low probability of being observed
while more massive ones would be too metal-rich. Observable host galaxies are
predicted to preferentially inhabit dark matter haloes in the range
10^11-10^11.5 solar masses, with a weak dependence on redshift.

Abrikosov lattice. For the newly discovered iron pnictide superconductors,
previous measurements have shown that, in electron-doped BaFe2As2, the vortices
form a highly disordered structure. In addition, the density of states (DOS)

triangular vortex lattice and the Andreev bound states in hole-doped BaFe2As2
by using a low temperature scanning tunneling microscope (STM). Detailed study
of the vortex cores reveals that the spectrum of the Andreev bound states
inside the vortex core exhibits a distinct spatial evolution: at the center of
the vortex core, it appears as a single peak at 0.5 mV below the Fermi-energy;
away from the core center, it gradually evolves into two sub-peaks and they
eventually fade out. The drastic differences between the vortex cores of the
electron-doped and hole-doped counterparts are illusive to the pairing

of circumstellar disks go through an early phase of quasi-static contraction
during which radii are large and internal temperatures are low. The main source
of opacity in these objects is dust grains. We investigate two problems
involving the effect of opacity on the evolution of planets of 3, 5, and 7 M_J.
First, we pick three different overall metallicities for the planet and simply
scale the opacity accordingly. We show that higher metallicity results in
slower contraction as a result of higher opacity. It is found that the
pre-collapse time scale is proportional to the metallicity. In this scenario,
survival of giant planets formed by gravitational instability is predicted to
be more likely around low-metallicity stars, since they evolve to the point of
collapse to small size on shorter time scales. But metal-rich planets, as a
result of longer contraction times, have the best opportunity to capture
planetesimals and form heavy-element cores. Second, we investigate the effects
of opacity reduction as a result of grain growth and settling, for the same
three planetary masses and for three different values of overall metallicity.
When these processes are included, the pre-collapse time scale is found to be
of order 1000 years for the three masses, significantly shorter than the time
scale calculated without these effects. In this case the time scale is found to
be relatively insensitive to planetary mass and composition. However, the
effects of planetary rotation and accretion of gas and dust, which could
increase the timescale, are not included in the calculation. The short time
scale we find would preclude metal enrichment by planetesimal capture, as well
as heavy-element core formation, over a large range of planetary masses and
metallicities.

extrasolar planets, but gaps in the observations produce aliases, spurious

In the case of Gl 581 d, the distinction between an alias and the true
frequency was the distinction between a frozen, dead planet and a planet
possibly hospitable to life (Udry et al. 2007; Mayor et al. 2009). To improve
the characterization of planetary systems, we describe how aliases originate
and present a new approach for distinguishing between orbital frequencies and
their aliases. Our approach harnesses features in the spectral window function
to compare the amplitude and phase of predicted aliases with peaks present in
the data. We apply it to confirm prior alias distinctions for the planets GJ
876 d and HD 75898 b. We find that the true periods of Gl 581 d and HD 73526
b/c remain ambiguous. We revise the periods of HD 156668 b and 55 Cnc e, which
were afflicted by daily aliases. For HD 156668 b, the correct period is 1.2699
days and minimum mass is (3.1 +/- 0.4) Earth masses. For 55 Cnc e, the correct
period is 0.7365 days -- the shortest of any known planet -- and minimum mass
is (8.3 +/- 0.3) Earth masses. This revision produces a significantly improved
5-planet Keplerian fit for 55 Cnc, and a self-consistent dynamical fit
describes the data just as well. As radial velocity techniques push to
ever-smaller planets, often found in systems of multiple planets,
distinguishing true periods from aliases will become increasingly important.

discuss how the mode evolution can be inferred directly from the background

derive semi-analytic formulae for the curvature, isocurvature, and cross

provides useful intuition into how the characteristics of the inflationary
Lagrangian translate into distinct features in the power spectra. In
particular, we find that key features of the power spectra can be directly read
off of the nature of the roll path, the curve the field vector rolls along with
respect to the field manifold. For example, models whose roll path makes a
sharp turn 60 e-folds before inflation ends tend to be ruled out because they
produce strong departures from scale invariance. Finally, we apply our
formalism to confront four classes of two-field models with WMAP data,
including doubly quadratic and quartic potentials and non-standard kinetic
terms, showing how whether a model is ruled out depends not only on certain
features of the inflationary Lagrangian, but also on the initial conditions.

mergers of different mass ratios to halo growth. We find that all resolved
mergers, up to mass ratios of 10^5, contribute only ~60% of the total halo mass
growth, while major mergers are subdominant, e.g. mergers with mass ratios
smaller than 3:1 (10:1) contribute only ~20% (~30%). This is verified with an
analysis of two additional simulation boxes, where we follow all particles
individually throughout cosmic time. Our results are also robust against using
several halo definitions. Under the assumption that the power-law behaviour of
the merger rate at large mass ratios can be extrapolated to arbitrarily large
mass ratios, it is found that, independently of halo mass, ~40% of the mass in
halos comes from genuinely smooth accretion of dark matter that was never bound
in smaller halos. We discuss possible implications of our findings for galaxy
formation. One implication, assuming as is standard that the pristine
intergalactic medium is heated and photoionized by UV photons, is that all
halos accrete >40% of their baryons in smooth ""cold"" T>~10^4K gas, rather than
as warm, enriched or clumpy gas or as stars.

SSFR (>~1.2x10^-10 / yr) systems. All galaxies with MIR activity index a_IRAC

molecules and a hot dust continuum. All elliptical/S0 galaxies are in the
low-SSFR locus, while 22 out of 24 spirals/irregulars are in the high-SSFR
locus, with two borderline cases. We divide our sample into three subsamples
(I, II and III) according to decreasing HI-richness of the parent galaxy group
to which a galaxy belongs. Consistent with the SSFR and a_IRAC bimodality, 12
out of 15 type-I (11 out of 12 type-III) galaxies are in the high- (low-) SSFR

HCG galaxies, galaxies in a comparison quiescent SINGS sub-sample are
continuously distributed both in SSFR and a_IRAC. Any uncertainties can only
further enhance the SSFR bimodality. These results suggest that an environment
characterized by high galaxy number-densities and low galaxy
velocity-dispersions, such as the one found in compact groups, plays a key role
in accelerating galaxy evolution by enhancing star-formation processes in

galaxy star formation histories (SFHs) are smoothly-rising and vary with mass
only by a scale factor. We use our latest simulations to test whether this
scenario can account for recent observations at z>=6 from WFC3/IR, NICMOS, and
IRAC. Our simulations broadly reproduce the observed ultraviolet (UV)
luminosity functions and stellar mass densities and their evolution at z=6-8,
all of which are nontrivial tests of the mean SFH. In agreement with
observations, simulated galaxies possess blue UV continua owing to young ages
(50-150 Myr), low metallicities (0.1-0.5 Zsun), and low dust columns (E(B-V) <=
0.05). Observations imply a near-unity slope in the stellar mass--star
formation rate relation at all z=6-8, confirming the prediction that SFH shapes
are invariant. Current surveys detect the majority of galaxies with stellar
masses exceeding 10^9 Msun and few galaxies less massive than 10^{8.5} Msun,
implying that they probe no more than the brightest 30% of the complete star
formation and stellar mass densities at z>=6. Finally, we demonstrate that
there is no conflict between smoothly-rising SFHs and recent clustering
observations. This is because momentum-driven outflows suppress star formation
in low-mass halos, leading to overall occupancies of 0.2-0.4 even though the
star formation duty cycle is one. This leads to many interesting predictions at
z>=4, among them that (1) optically-selected and UV-selected samples largely
overlap; (2) few galaxies exhibit significantly suppressed specific star
formation rates; and (3) occupancy is constant or increasing with decreasing
luminosity. These predictions are in tentative agreement with current
observations, but further analysis of existing and upcoming data sets is
required in order to test them more thoroughly. (abridged)

massive gravity known as null warped anti-de Sitter spacetimes. These are
pp-wave extensions of three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space. We first perform
a careful analysis of the linearized stability of black holes in these
spacetimes. We find two qualitatively different types of solutions to the
linearized equations of motion: the first set has an exponential time
dependence, the second - a polynomial time dependence. The solutions polynomial
in time induce severe pathologies and moreover survive at the non-linear level.
In order to make sense of these geometries, it is thus crucial to impose
appropriate boundary conditions. We argue that there exists a consistent set of
boundary conditions that allows us to reject the above pathological modes from
the physical spectrum. The asymptotic symmetry group associated to these
boundary conditions consists of a centrally-extended Virasoro algebra. Using
this central charge we can account for the entropy of the black holes via
Cardy's formula. Finally, we note that the black hole spectrum is chiral and
prove a Birkoff theorem showing that there are no other stationary axisymmetric
black holes with the specified asymptotics. We extend most of the analysis to a

well-known problems in theoretical physics. Problems quantizing general
relativity because it is not renormalizable have led to a search for a new
theory of gravity that, while still agreeing with measured observations, is
renormalizable. In this paper, a spin-1 Yang-Mills force theory with a SO(4,1)
or {\em de Sitter} group symmetry is developed. By deriving the standard
geodesic equation and the first post-Newtonian approximation equations, it is
shown that this theory, coupled to Dirac fields, predicts all N-body and light
observations of gravitational phenomena to within experimental accuracy.
Furthermore, because of the separation of gauge covariance from coordinate
diffeomorphism, the theory satisfies the strong equivalence principle while
maintaining a Minkowski coordinate metric. Cosmology is also briefly addressed:
Vacuum energy is the most common explanation for the accelerating expansion of
the universe but suffers from the drawback that any reasonable prediction of it
is 120 orders of magnitude too large. The de Sitter solution to the Einstein
Field Equations is an alternative to vacuum energy as an explanation for the
accelerating expansion of the universe but only if the universe is
approximately a vacuum. The proposed gauge theory, however, avoids both these
problems and, cosmologically, the accelerating expansion of the universe is
shown as a consequence of the de Sitter group Lie algebra. In addition, with
quantized mass, because it is a generic massless, semi-simple Yang-Mills
theory, it is mathematically proved to be a perturbatively renormalizable
quantum theory of gravity.

Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph $G_n(p_n)$, where each edge is given an
independent exponential edge weight with rate 1. In the sparse regime, i.e.,
when $np_n\to \lambda>1,$ we find refined asymptotics both for the minimal
weight of the path between uniformly chosen vertices in the giant component, as
well as for the hopcount (i.e., the number of edges) on this minimal weight
path. More precisely, we prove a central limit theorem for the hopcount, with
asymptotic mean and variance both equal to $\lambda/(\lambda-1)\log{n}$.
Furthermore, we prove that the minimal weight centered by $\log{n}/(\lambda-1)$
converges in distribution. We also investigate the dense regime, where $np_n
\to \infty$. We find that although the base graph is a {\it ultra small}
(meaning that graph distances between uniformly chosen vertices are
$o(\log{n})$), attaching random edge weights changes the geometry of the
network completely. Indeed, the hopcount $H_n$ satisfies the universality
property that whatever be the value of $p_n$, \ $H_n/\log{n}\to 1$ in
probability and, more precisely, $(H_n-\beta_n\log{n})/\sqrt{\log{n}}$, where
$\beta_n=\lambda_n/(\lambda_n-1)$, has a limiting standard normal distribution.
The constant $\beta_n$ can be replaced by 1 precisely when $\lambda_n\gg
\sqrt{\log{n}}$, a case that has appeared in the literature (under stronger
conditions on $\lambda_n$). We also find bounds for the maximal weight and
maximal hopcount between vertices in the graph. This paper continues the
investigation of FPP initiated by the authors. Compared to the setting on the
configuration model studied in \cite{BHHS08}, the proofs presented here are
much simpler due to a direct relation between FPP on the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi

exponential or logistic loss, our online algorithm makes use of LDA's learning
criterion that not only aims to maximize the class-separation criterion but
also incorporates the asymmetrical property of training data distributions. We
provide a better alternative for online boosting algorithms in the context of
training a visual object detector. We demonstrate the robustness and efficiency
of our methods on handwriting digit and face data sets. Our results confirm
that object detection tasks benefit significantly when trained in an online
manner.

field distribution of a line current in the so-called Maxwell's fish eye lens,
which has been claimed recently to be able to achieve perfect imaging. We show
that such a Maxwell's fish eye lens cannot give perfect imaging due to the fact
that high order modes of the object field can hardly reach the image point in
the Maxwell's fish eye. If only zero order mode is excited, a subwavelength
image can be achieved, however, its spot-size is larger than the spot size of
the source field. The image resolution is determined by the field spot size of
the image corresponding to the zeroth order component of the object field. Our
explicit analysis consists very well with the FEM results for a modified fish
eye bounded with perfectly electrical conductor (PEC). Explicit condition is
given for achieving a subwavelength image. When this condition is not
satisfied, a single line current source may give multiple image spots.

Furthermore, a constitutive viscoelastic law is derived for the composite

team the flexibility to adopt a set of principles and practices based on their
culture and values. While that flexibility is consistent with the agile
philosophy, it can lead to the adoption of principles and practices that can be
sub-optimal relative to the desired objectives. We question then, how can one
determine if adopted practices are ""in sync"" with the identified principles,
and to what extent those principles support organizational objectives? In this
research, we focus on assessing the ""goodness"" of an agile method adopted by an
organization based on (1) its adequacy, (2) the capability of the organization
to provide the supporting environment to competently implement the method, and
(3) its effectiveness. To guide our assessment, we propose the Objectives,
Principles and Practices (OPP) framework. The design of the OPP framework
revolves around the identification of the agile objectives, principles that
support the achievement of those objectives, and practices that reflect the
""spirit"" of those principles. Well-defined linkages between the objectives and
principles, and between the principles and practices are also established to
support the assessment process. We traverse these linkages in a top-down
fashion to assess adequacy and a bottom-up fashion to assess capability and
effectiveness. This is a work-in-progress paper, outlining our proposed
research, preliminary results and future directions.

governed by a relativistic Hamiltonian for the orbital motion and by the
Thomas-Bargmann-Michel-Telegdi equation for the precession of the spin. It is
natural to ask whether the classical Hamiltonian (with both the orbital and
spin parts) is consistent with that in the relativistic quantum theory for a
spin-1/2 charged particle, which is described by the Dirac equation. In the
low-energy limit, up to terms of the 7th order in $1/E_g$ ($E_g=2mc^2$ and $m$
is the particle mass), we investigate the Foldy-Wouthuysen (FW) transformation
of the Dirac Hamiltonian in the presence of homogeneous and static
electromagnetic fields and show that it is indeed in agreement with the
classical Hamiltonian with the gyromagnetic ratio being equal to 2. Through
electromagnetic duality, this result can be generalized for a spin-1/2 dyon,
which has both electric and magnetic charges and thus possesses both intrinsic
electric and magnetic dipole moments. Furthermore, the relativistic quantum
theory for a spin-1/2 dyon with arbitrary values of the gyromagnetic and
gyroelectric ratios can be described by the Dirac-Pauli equation, which is the
Dirac equation with augmentation for the anomalous electric and anomalous
magnetic dipole moments. The FW transformation of the Dirac-Pauli Hamiltonian
is shown, up to the 7th order again, to be also in accord with the classical
Hamiltonian.
