cosmic rays. Molecular clouds associated with SNRs can produce gamma-ray
emission through the interaction of accelerated particles with the concentrated
gas. The middle aged SNR W28, for its associated system of dense molecular
clouds, provides an excellent opportunity to test this hypothesis. We present
the AGILE/GRID observations of SNR W28, and compare them with observations at
other wavelengths (TeV and 12CO J=1-->0 molecular line emission). The gamma-ray
flux detected by AGILE from the dominant source associated with W28 is (14 +-
5) 10^-8 ph cm^-2 s^-1 for E > 400 MeV. This source is positionally well
correlated with the TeV emission observed by the HESS telescope. The local
variations of the GeV to TeV flux ratio suggest a difference between the CR
spectra of the north-west and south molecular cloud complexes. A model based on
a hadronic-induced interaction and diffusion with two molecular clouds at
different distances from the W28 shell can explain both the morphological and
spectral features observed by AGILE in the MeV-GeV energy range and by the HESS
telescope in the TeV energy range. The combined set of AGILE and H.E.S.S. data
strongly support a hadronic model for the gamma-ray production in W28.

to families whose parameter space T may be non-reduced, e.g., the spectrum of a

MAGIC. The flare occurred at orbital phase 0.91, where phase 1 is the
configuration with the black hole behind the companion high-mass star, when the
absorption of gamma-ray photons by photon-photon annihilation with the stellar

gamma-ray flare. We study the gamma-ray opacity due to pair creation along the

possible mechanism for the production of the VHE emission. We present detailed
calculations of the gamma-ray opacity and infer from these calculations the
distance from the black hole where the emitting region was located. We suggest
that the flare was the result of a jet-clump interaction where the decay
products of inelastic proton-proton collisions dominate the VHE outcome. We are
able to reproduce the spectrum of Cyg X-1 during the observed flare under
reasonable assumptions. The flare may be the first event of jet-cloud

X-ray burst sources and show explicitly how systematic uncertainties, such as
the photospheric radius at touchdown, affect the most probable masses and
radii. We introduce a parameterized equation of state and use a Markov Chain
Monte Carlo algorithm within a Bayesian framework to determine nuclear
parameters such as the incompressibility and the density dependence of the bulk
symmetry energy. Using this framework we show, for the first time, that these
parameters, predicted solely on the basis of astrophysical observations, all
lie in ranges expected from nuclear systematics and laboratory experiments. We
find significant constraints on the mass-radius relation for neutron stars, and
hence on the pressure-density relation of dense matter. The predicted symmetry
energy and the equation of state near the saturation density are soft,
resulting in relatively small neutron star radii around 11-12 km for M=1.4
Msun. The predicted equation of state stiffens at higher densities, however,
and our preferred model for X-ray bursts suggests that the neutron star maximum
mass is relatively large, 1.9-2.2 Msun. Our results imply that several commonly

loop quantum gravity, most of the results presented here can be applied for
different bouncing cosmologies. We concentrate on the scenario where the scalar
field, as the result of contraction of the universe, is driven from the bottom
of the potential well. The field is amplified, and finally the phase of the
standard slow-roll inflation is realized. Such an evolution modifies the
standard inflationary spectrum of perturbations by the additional oscillations
and damping on the large scales. We extract the parameters of the model from
the observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation. In particular,
the value of inflaton mass is equal to $m=(2.6 \pm 0.6) \cdot 10^{13}$ GeV. In
our considerations we base on the seven years of observations made by the WMAP
satellite. We propose the new observational consistency check for the phase of
slow-roll inflation. We investigate the conditions which have to be fulfilled
to make the observations of the Big Bounce effects possible. We translate them
to the requirements on the parameters of the model and then put the
observational constraints on the model. Based on assumption usually made in
loop quantum cosmology, the Barbero-Immirzi parameter was shown to be
constrained by $\gamma<1100$ from the cosmological observations. We have
compared the Big Bounce model with the standard Big Bang scenario and showed
that the present observational data is not informative enough to distinguish

is as follows: two samples should be put into the same cluster if and only if
they were generated by the same distribution. With this notion of consistency,
clustering generalizes such classical statistical problems as homogeneity
testing and process classification. We show that, for the case of a known
number of clusters, consistency can be achieved under the only assumption that
the joint distribution of the data is stationary ergodic (no parametric or
Markovian assumptions, no assumptions of independence, neither between nor
within the samples). If the number of clusters is unknown, consistency can be
achieved under appropriate assumptions on the mixing rates of the processes.
(again, no parametric or independence assumptions). In both cases we give
examples of simple (at most quadratic in each argument) algorithms which are
consistent.

regard to content, a well-defined and high quality corpus is essential. This
implies that repository services are likely to be most successful when

high value to specific scholarly communities is essential. This implies that
repositories are likely to be most useful to scholars when they offer dedicated

challenges and barriers to repository development may be identified in three
key dimensions: a) identification and deposit of content; b) access and use of

correlation between the medium and hard-energy X-ray fluxes measured by
INTEGRAL, which indicates an almost constant spectral index over six years. The
majority of INTEGRAL observations were made when the source was either at a
very bright or very dim hard--X-ray state. We find that thermal Comptonization
models applied to the bright state yields the plasma temperature of 50--70 keV
and its optical depth of 1.3--2.6, depending on the assumed source geometry.
For the dim state, these parameters are in the ranges of 180--230 keV and
0.3--0.7, respectively. The Compton parameter is y = 1 for all the spectra,
indicating a stable geometry. Using this result, we can determine the
reflection effective solid angles associated with the close and distant
reprocessing media as = 0.3 x 2pi and 0.2 x 2pi, respectively. The plasma
energy balance, the weak disc reflection and a comparison of the UV fluxes
illuminating the plasma to the observed ones are all consistent with an inner
hot accretion surrounded by an outer cold disc. The disc truncation radius can
be determined from an approximate equipartition between the observed UV and

radii. Alternatively, our results can be explained by a mildly relativistic

of most galaxies is intertwined with the physical processes that drive the
formation of the galaxies themselves. The evolution of the relations between
the mass of the BH, m_BH, and the properties of its host therefore represent
crucial aspects of the galaxy formation process. We use a cosmological
simulation, as well as an analytical model, to investigate how and why the
scaling relations for BHs evolve with cosmic time. We find that a simulation
that reproduces the observed redshift zero relations between m_BH and the
properties of its host galaxy, as well as the thermodynamic profiles of the
intragroup medium, also reproduces the observed evolution in the ratio m_BH/m_s
for massive galaxies, although the evolution of the m_BH/sigma relation is in
apparent conflict with observations. The simulation predicts that the relations
between m_BH and the binding energies of both the galaxy and its dark matter
halo do not evolve, while the ratio m_BH/m_halo increases with redshift. The
simple, analytic model of Booth & Schaye (2010), in which the mass of the BH is
controlled by the gravitational binding energy of its host halo, quantitatively
reproduces the latter two results. Finally, we can explain the evolution in the
relations between m_BH and the mass and binding energy of the stellar component
of its host galaxy for massive galaxies (m_s~10^11 M_sun) at low redshift (z<1)
if these galaxies grow primarily through dry mergers.

The thesis starts with a brief review of the relativistic quantum mechanics. In
order to describe the effects of Lorentz transformations on the entangled
states, quantum mechanics and special relativity are merged by construction of
the unitary irreducible representations of Poincar{\'e} group on the infinite
dimensional Hilbert space of state vectors. In this framework, the issue of
finding the unitary irreducible representations of Poincar{\'e} group is
reduced to that of the little group. Wigner rotation for the massive particles
plays a crucial role due to its effect on the spin polarization directions.
Furthermore, the physical requirements for constructing the correct
relativistic spin operator is also studied. Then, the entanglement and Bell
type inequalities are reviewed. Special attention has been devoted to two
historical papers, by EPR in 1935 and by J.S. Bell in 1964. The main part of
the thesis is based on the Lorentz transformation of the Bell states and the
Bell inequalities on these transformed states. It is shown that entanglement is
a Lorentz invariant quantity. That is, no inertial observer can see the
entangled state as a separable one. However, it was shown that the Bell
inequality may be satisfied for the Wigner angle dependent transformed
entangled states. Since the Wigner rotation changes the spin polarization
direction with the increased velocity, initial dichotomous operators can
satisfy the Bell inequality for those states. By choosing the dichotomous
operators taking into consideration the Wigner angle, it is always possible to
show that Bell type inequalities can be violated for the transformed entangled
states.

characterize an attenuation parameter that depends on the frequency scaling as

upper bound is inversely proportional to the attenuation parameter, thus
resulting in a highly power-limited network. Interestingly, it is seen that
unlike the case of wireless radio networks, our upper bound is intrinsically
related to the attenuation parameter but not the spreading factor. Furthermore,
we describe an achievable scheme based on the simple nearest neighbor multi-hop
(MH) transmission. It is shown under extended networks that the MH scheme is
order-optimal as the attenuation parameter scales exponentially with $\sqrt{n}$
(or faster). Finally, these scaling results are extended to a random network

particles which have competing long range repulsive and short range attractive
interactions as a function of density and temperature. For increasing density,
there are well defined transitions between a low density clump phase, an
intermediate stripe phase, an anticlump phase, and a high density uniform
phase. To characterize the transitions between these phases we propose several
measures which take into account the different length scales in the system. For
increasing temperature, we find an intermediate phase that is liquid-like on
the short length scale of interparticle spacing but solid-like on the larger
length scale of the clump, stripe, or anticlump pattern. This intermediate
phase persists over the widest temperature range in the stripe state when the
local particle lattice within an individual stripe melts well below the
temperature at which the entire stripe structure breaks down, and is
characterized by intra-stripe diffusion of particles without inter-stripe
diffusion. This is followed at higher temperatures by the onset of inter-stripe
diffusion in an anisotropic diffusion phase, and then by breakup of the stripe
structure. We identify the transitions between these regimes through diffusion,
specific heat, and energy fluctuation measurements, and find that within the
intra-stripe liquid regime, the excess entropy goes into disordering the
particle arrangements within the stripe rather than affecting the stripe
structure itself. The clump and anticlump phases also show multiple
temperature-induced diffusive regimes which are not as pronounced as those of
the stripe phase.

connection, and includes changes in the star's mass and radius and a decreasing
accretion rate. The model also includes, for the first time in a spin evolution
model, the opening of the stellar magnetic field lines, as expected to arise
from twisting via star-disk differential rotation. In order to isolate the
effect that this has on the star-disk interaction torques, we neglect the
influence of torques that may arise from open field regions connected to the
star or disk. For a range of magnetic field strengths, accretion rates, and
initial spin rates, we compute the stellar spin rates of pre-main-sequence
stars as they evolve on the Hayashi track to an age of 3~Myr. How much the
field opening affects the spin depends on the strength of the coupling of the
magnetic field to the disk. For the relatively strong coupling (i.e., high
magnetic Reynolds number) expected in real systems, all models predict spin
periods of less than $\sim3$ days, in the age range of 1--3~Myr. Furthermore,
these systems typically do not reach an equilibrium spin rate within 3~Myr, so
that the spin at any given time depends upon the choice of initial spin rate.
This corroborates earlier suggestions that, in order to explain the full range
of observed rotation periods of approximately $1$--$10$ days, additional
processes, such as the angular momentum loss from powerful stellar winds, are
necessary.

by measuring its relative decay rates into pairs of electroweak vector bosons:
WW, ZZ, \gamma\gamma, and Z\gamma. With the data-driven assumption that

always be done if all four decay modes to electroweak vector bosons can be
observed or constrained. We exhibit interesting special cases of Higgs
look-alikes with nonstandard decay patterns, including a very suppressed
branching to WW or very enhanced branchings to \gamma\gamma and Z\gamma. Even
if two vector boson branching fractions conform to Standard Model expectations
for a Higgs doublet, measurements of the other two decay modes could unmask a

scenarios. However, the extraction of primordial non-Gaussianity is a difficult
endeavor since several effects of non-primordial nature can produce
non-Gaussianity. On the other hand, different statistical tools can in
principle provide information about distinct forms of non-Gaussianity. Thus,
any single statistical estimator cannot be sensitive to all possible forms of
non-Gaussianity. In this context, to shed some light in the potential sources
of deviation from Gaussianity in CMB data it is important to use different
statistical indicators. In a recent paper we proposed two new large-angle
non-Gaussianity indicators which provide measures of the departure from
Gaussianity on large angular scales. We used these indicators to carry out
analyses of non-Gaussianity of the bands and of the foreground-reduced WMAP

functions that simulate fuzzy edges of the slits. Waves of matter be computed
by this method show perfect interference patterns both between the gratings and
behind the second grating. Coherent and noncoherent the distributed particle
sources reproducing the interference patterns are discussed in details.
Paraxial approximation stems from the wave function when removing the
distributed sources onto infinity. The more hard-edged slits of the grating
$G_{1}$ are examined by simulating those slits by a superposition of more hard
the Gaussian functions.
  As for the particles here we consider fullerene molecules. De Broglie
wavelength of the molecules is adopted equal to 5 pm.

  for hook competition and unbaited hooks","submitted",,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The most commonly used relative abundance index in stock assessments of
longline fisheries is catch per unit effort (CPUE), here defined as the number
of fish of the targeted species caught per hook and minute of soak time.
Longline CPUE can be affected by interspecific competition and the retrieval of
unbaited or empty hooks, and interannual variation in these can lead to biases
in the apparent abundance trends in the CPUE. Interspecific competition on
longlines has been previously studied but the return of empty hooks is ignored
in all current treatments of longline CPUE. In this work we propose some
different methods to build indices to address the interspecific competition
that relates to empty hooks. We show that in the absence of information about
empty hooks, the relative abundance estimates have constant biases with respect
to fish density and this is typically not problematic for stock assessment. The
simple CPUE index behaves poorly in every scenario. Understanding the reasons
for empty hooks allows selection of the appropriate index. A scientific
longline survey is conducted every two years in the Strait of Georgia, British
Columbia by Fisheries and Oceans Canada. The above methods are applied to build
the time-series of indices from 2003 to 2009 for quillback rockfish (Sebastes
maliger). Due to variation in the incidence of non-target species, the index
trend obtained is moderately sensitive to the choice of the estimator.

two comparative AGN samples (mostly quasars) selected therein, a broad-line
Seyfert\,1 (BLS1) type sample and a narrow-line Seyfert\,1 (NLS1) type AGN
sample within redshifts 0.3--0.8. Their spectral parameters are derived from
the SDSS spectroscopic data. It is found that on rest-frame timescales of
several years the NLS1-type AGNs show systematically smaller variability
compared to the BLS1-type. In fact, the variability amplitude is found to
correlate, though only moderately, with the Eigenvector\,1 parameters, i.e.,
the smaller the \hb\ linewidth, the weaker the [O\,III] and the stronger the
\feii\ emission, the smaller the variability amplitude is. Moreover, an
interesting inverse correlation is found between the variability and the
Eddington ratio, which is perhaps more fundamental. The previously known
dependence of the variability on luminosity is not significant, and that on
black hole mass---as claimed in recent papers and also present in our
data---fades out when controlling for the Eddington ratio in the correlation
analysis, though these may be partly due to the limited ranges of luminosity
and black hole mass of our samples. Our result strongly supports that an
accretion disk is likely to play a major role in producing the opitcal/UV
variability.

the pion-superfluidity phase transition in the mu_{iso}-T plane at mu_B=0 as

experiences an expected number of $O(n^2\beta_{s+2}(n)\log^2n)$ discrete

$\beta_{s+2}(q)=\lambda_{s+2}(q)/q$, and $\lambda_{s+2}(q)$ is the maximum
length of Davenport-Schinzel sequences of order $s+2$ on $n$ symbols. Thus,
compared to the previous solution of Agarwal et al.~\cite{AWY}, we achieve a

for different types of network intrusions. Due to the tremendous growth of
network-based services, intrusion detection has emerged as an important
technique for network security. Recently data mining algorithms are applied on
network-based traffic data and host-based program behaviors to detect
intrusions or misuse patterns, but there exist some issues in current intrusion
detection algorithms such as unbalanced detection rates, large numbers of false
positives, and redundant attributes that will lead to the complexity of
detection model and degradation of detection accuracy. The purpose of this
study is to identify important input attributes for building an intrusion

profiles for galaxy clusters. The gas is assumed to be in hydrostatic
equilibrium along with a component of non-thermal pressure taken from
simulations and the gas fraction approaches the cosmic mean value only at the
virial radius or beyond. The free parameters of the model are the slope and
normalisation of the concentration-mass relation, the gas polytropic index, and
slope and normalisation of the mass-temperature relation. These parameters can
be fixed from X-Ray and lensing observations. We compare our gas pressure
profiles to the recently proposed `Universal' pressure profile by
\cite{Arnaud09} and find very good agreement. We find that the
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect (SZE) scaling relations between the integrated SZE
flux, $Y$, the cluster gas temperature, $T_{\rm sl}$, the cluster mass, $M_{\rm
tot}$, and the gas mass, $M_{\rm gas}$ are in excellent agreement with the
recently observed $r_{2500}$ SZE scaling relations by \cite{Bonamente08} and
$r_{500}$ relation by \cite{Arnaud09}. The gas mass fraction increases with
cluster mass and is given by $f_{\rm gas}(r_{500}) = 0.1324 + 0.0284
\,\rm{log}\, (\frac{M_{500}}{10^{15}h^{-1}M_\odot})$. This is within $10%$ of
observed $f_{\rm gas}(r_{500})$. The consistency between the global properties
of clusters detected in X-Rays and in SZE shows that we are looking at a common
population of clusters as a whole, and there is no deficit of SZE flux relative
to expectations from \xr scaling properties. Thus, it makes it easier to
compare and cross-calibrate clusters from upcoming \xr and SZE surveys.

goals are to shed light on the first phase of intermediate mass star formation
and to compare these protostars with low- and high-mass sources. Methods: We
derived the dust and gas temperature and density profiles of the sample. We
analysed all existing continuum data on each source and modelled the resulting
SED with the 1D radiative transfer code DUSTY. The gas temperature was then
predicted by means of a modified version of the code CHT96. Results: We found
that the density profiles of five out of six studied intermediate mass
envelopes are consistent with the predictions of the ""inside-out"" collapse

density profile, the size, the mass, the average density, the density at 1000
AU and the density at 10 K of the envelopes of low-, intermediate, and
high-mass protostars. When considering these various physical parameters, the

for the IEEE 802.11 wireless local area networks (WLANs). For network planners
who are deploying VoIP over WLANs, one of the important issues is the VoIP
capacity. VoIP bandwidth consumption over a WAN is one of the most important
factors to consider when building a VoIP infrastructure. Failure to account for
VoIP bandwidth requirements will severely limit the reliability of a VoIP
system and place a huge burden on the WAN infrastructure. Less bandwidth
utilization is the key reasons for reduced number of channel accesses in VOIP.
But in the QoS point of view the free bandwidth of atleast 1-5% will improve
the voice quality. This proposal utilizes the maximum bandwidth by leaving 1-5%
free bandwidth. A Bandwidth Data rate Moderation (BDM) algorithm has been
proposed which correlates the data rate specified in IEEE802.11b with the free
bandwidth. At each time BDM will calculate the bandwidth utilization before
sending the packet to improve performance and voice quality of VoIP. The
bandwidth calculation in BDM can be done by using Erlang and VOIP bandwidth
calculator. Finally, ns2 experimental study shows the relationship between
bandwidth utilization, free bandwidth and data rate. The paper concludes that
marginal VoIP call rate has been increased by BDM algorithm.

external field evolving under a Glauber spin-flip dynamics corresponding to a
possibly different temperature. We study the limiting conditional probabilities
and their continuity properties and discuss their set of points of
discontinuity (bad points). We provide a complete analysis of the transition
between Gibbsian and non-Gibbsian behavior as a function of time, extending
earlier work for the case of independent spin-flip dynamics. For initial
temperature bigger than one we prove that the time-evolved measure stays Gibbs
forever, for any (possibly low) temperature of the dynamics. In the regime of
heating to low-temperatures from even lower temperatures, when the initial
temperature is smaller than the temperature of the dynamics, and smaller than
1, we prove that the time-evolved measure is Gibbs initially and becomes
non-Gibbs after a sharp transition time. We find this regime is further divided
into a region where only symmetric bad configurations exist, and a region where
this symmetry is broken. In the regime of further cooling from low-temperatures
there is always symmetry-breaking in the set of bad configurations. These bad
configurations are created by a new mechanism which is related to the
occurrence of periodic orbits for the vector field which describes the dynamics
of Euler-Lagrange equations for the path large deviation functional for the
order parameter. To our knowledge this is the first example of the rigorous
study of non-Gibbsian phenomena related to cooling, albeit in a mean-field

SU(6) symmetry breaking terms are then included to account for the physical
meson masses and decay constants, while preserving partial conservation of the
axial current in the light pseudoscalar sector. Next, the $T-$matrix amplitudes

algorithmic approach is well-suited to the problems that are well-understood
and known solution(s). On the other hand the ANNs have learning by example and
processing capabilities similar to that of a human brain. ANN has been followed
due to its inherent advantage over conversion algorithmic like approaches and
having capabilities, training and human like intuitive decision making
capabilities. Therefore, this ANN based approach is likely to help researchers
and organizations to reach a better solution to the problem of managing the
human resource. The study is particularly important as many studies have been
carried in developed countries but there is a shortage of such studies in
developing nations like India. Here, a model has been derived using

distant exoplanets, but it also enables characterization of the lens and source
stars involved in the lensing event. In high magnification events, the lens
caustic may cross over the source disk, which allows a determination of the
angular size of the source and additionally a measurement of its limb
darkening. When such extended-source effects appear close to maximum
magnification, the resulting light curve differs from the characteristic
Paczynski point-source curve. The exact shape of the light curve close to the
peak depends on the limb darkening of the source. Dense photometric coverage
permits measurement of the respective limb-darkening coefficients. In the case
of microlensing event OGLE 2008-BLG-290, the K giant source star reached a peak
magnification of about 100. Thirteen different telescopes have covered this
event in eight different photometric bands. Subsequent light-curve analysis
yielded measurements of linear limb-darkening coefficients of the source in six
photometric bands. The best-measured coefficients lead to an estimate of the
source effective temperature of about 4700 +100-200 K. However, the photometric
estimate from colour-magnitude diagrams favours a cooler temperature of 4200
+-100 K. As the limb-darkening measurements, at least in the CTIO/SMARTS2 V and
I bands, are among the most accurate obtained, the above disagreement needs to
be understood. A solution is proposed, which may apply to previous events where
such a discrepancy also appeared.

with the establishment of the ubiquitous nodal cuprate kink leading to the way
isotope substitution has shed a critical new perspective on the role and
strength of electron-phonon coupling. We continue with recently published work
on the connection between the phonon dispersion as seen with inelastic x-ray
scattering (IXS) and the location of the kink as observed by ARPES near the
nodal point. Finally, we present very recent and ongoing ARPES work examining
how induced strain through chemical pressure provides a potentially promising
avenue for understanding the broader role of the lattice to the superconducting
phase and larger cuprate phase diagram.

comparable to those of starburst galaxies. We also find that most of the LIRGs
have the minima of the [NeIII]/[NeII] ratio located at their nuclei. It is
likely that increased densities in the nuclei are responsible for the smaller
nuclear ratios. In the nuclei, it is also possible that the most massive stars

discuss the possible contribution of an AGN to the nuclear mid-IR emission of
the galaxy, which in general is low in these local LIRGs.

dynamically changing inputs and also their ability to learn makes them ideal
candidates for employing them for tuning purpose. In this paper, a novel tuning
algorithm based on neural network estimated tuning parameters is presented. The
key performance indicators are proactively monitored and fed as input to the
Neural Network and the trained network estimates the suitable size of the
buffer cache, shared pool and redo log buffer size. The tuner alters these
tuning parameters using the estimated values using a rate change computing

axiomatization of special relativity introduced by Andr\'eka, Madar\'asz and
N\'emeti. These extensions include extension to accelerated observers,
relativistic dynamics and general relativity; however, its main subject is the
extension to accelerated observers (AccRel). One surprising result is that
natural extension to accelerated observers is not enough if we want our theory
to imply certain experimental facts, such as the twin paradox. Even if we add
the whole first-order theory of real numbers to this natural extension, it is
still not enough to imply the twin paradox. Nevertheless, that does not mean
that this task cannot be carried out within first-order logic since by
approximating a second-order logic axiom of real numbers, we introduce a
first-order axiom schema that solves the problem. Our theory AccRel nicely
fills the gap between special and general relativity theories, and only one
natural generalization step is needed to achieve a first-order logic
axiomatization of general relativity from it. We also show that AccRel is
strong enough to make predictions about the gravitational effect slowing down
time. Our general aims are to axiomatize relativity theories within pure
first-order logic using simple, comprehensible and transparent basic
assumptions (axioms); to prove the surprising predictions (theorems) of
relativity theories from a few convincing axioms; to eliminate tacit
assumptions from relativity by replacing them with explicit axioms formulated
in first-order logic (in the spirit of the first-order logic foundation of
mathematics and Tarski's axiomatization of geometry); and to investigate the
relationship between the axioms and the theorems.

and mixing of chemical elements. Furthermore, the evolution of stellar rotation
is coupled to the evolution of circumstellar disks. Disk-braking mechanisms are
believed to be responsible for rotational deceleration during the accretion
phase, and rotational spin-up during the contraction phase after decoupling
from the disk for fast rotators arriving at the ZAMS. We investigate the
projected rotational velocities vsini of a sample of young stars with respect
to the stellar mass and disk evolutionary state to search for possible
indications of disk-braking mechanisms. We analyse the stellar spectra of 220
nearby (mostly <100pc) young (2-600 Myr) stars for their vsini, stellar age,
Halpha emission, and accretion rates. The stars have been observed with FEROS
and HARPS in La Silla, Chile. The spectra have been cross-correlated with
appropriate theoretical templates. We build a new calibration to be able to
derive vsini values from the cross-correlated spectra. Stellar ages are
estimated from the LiI equivalent width at 6708 Ang. The equivalent width and
width at 10% height of the Halpha emission are measured to identify accretors
and used to estimate accretion rates. The vsini is then analysed with respect
to the evolutionary state of the circumstellar disks to search for indications
of disk-braking mechanisms in accretors. We find that the broad vsini
distribution of our targets extends to rotation velocities of up to more than
100 km/s and peaks at a value of 7.8+-1.2 km/s, and that ~70% of our stars show
vsini<30 km/s. Furthermore, we can find indications for disk-braking in
accretors and rotational spin-up of stars which are decoupled from their disks.
In addition, we show that a number of young stars are suitable for precise
radial-velocity measurements for planet-search surveys.

making them ideal candidates with which to probe the properties of their host
galaxies. However, current quantitative spectroscopic techniques require
spectral resolutions of R>17,000, making observations of RSGs at distances
greater than 1Mpc unfeasible. Here we explore the potential of quantitative
spectroscopic techniques at much lower resolutions, R ~2-3000. We take archival
J-band spectra of a sample of RSGs in the Solar neighbourhood. In this spectral
region the metallic lines of FeI, MgI, SiI and TiI are prominent, while the
molecular absorption features of OH, H_2O, CN and CO are weak. We compare these
data with synthetic spectra produced from the existing grid of model
atmospheres from the MARCS project, with the aim of deriving chemical
abundances. We find that all stars studied can be unambiguously fit by the
models, and model parameters of log g, effective temperatures Teff,
microturbulence and global metal content may be derived. We find that the
abundances derived for the stars are all very close to Solar and have low
dispersion, with an average of [logZ]=0.13+/-0.14. The values of Teff fit by
the models are ~150K cooler than the stars' literature values for earlier
spectral types when using the Levesque et al. temperature scale, though this
temperature discrepancy has very little systematic effect on the derived
abundances as the equivalent widths (EWs) of the metallic lines are roughly
constant across the full temperature range of RSGs. Instead, elemental
abundances are the dominating factor in the EWs of the diagnostic lines. Our
results suggest that chemical abundance measurements of RSGs are possible at
low- to medium-resolution, meaning that this technique is a viable
infrared-based alternative to measuring abundance trends in external galaxies.

contribution. In particular, the dynamic structure function S(Q, $\omega$) of

performs an average over scattering angles relative to crystal axes in random
orientations. This method uses an analytical dispersion function with force
constants derived from neutron scattering data of single crystal D$_2$ in the
framework of an axially symmetric force tensor. The resulting two dimensional
map of S(Q, $\omega$) captures details of the phonon branches as well as the
molecular rotations, that can be compared directly to data from inelastic
neutron scattering on polycrystalline D$_2$. This high resolution information
is used to calculate the absolute cross-sections of production and upscattering
loss of ultracold neutron (UCN). The resulting scattering cross-sections are

Program observed secondary eclipses of WASP-18b using Spitzer's Infrared Array
Camera (IRAC) in the 3.6 micron and 5.8 micron bands on 2008 December 20, and
in the 4.5 micron and 8.0 micron bands on 2008 December 24. We report eclipse
depths of 0.30 +/- 0.02%, 0.39 +/- 0.02%, 0.37 +/- 0.03%, 0.41 +/- 0.02%, and
brightness temperatures of 3100 +/- 90, 3310 +/- 130, 3080 +/- 140 and 3120 +/-
110 K in order of increasing wavelength. WASP-18b is one of the hottest planets
yet discovered - as hot as an M-class star. The planet's pressure-temperature
profile most likely features a thermal inversion. The observations also require
WASP-18b to have near-zero albedo and almost no redistribution of energy from
the day-side to the night side of the planet.

on the induced phase manifold. If the phases are connected, the set of
equilibria of the system forms a (n+1)-dimensional manifold, each equilibrium
is stable, and it is shown that global solutions which do not develop

is proved by means of the energy functional combined with the generalized

three active neutrinos may acquire non-zero Majorana masses through the

precision measurements are studied. Due to the $Z_2$ discrete flavor symmetry,
right-handed Majorana neutrinos can serve as cold dark matter candidate of the
Universe. Constraint from dark matter relic abundance is calculated.

leading order rank one structure of the Yukawa matrices. We consider two
possibilities for the suppression of baryon and lepton number violation. The
first is based on Flipped SU(5) with gauge group SU(5)\times U(1)_\chi \times
SU(4)_{\perp} in which U(1)_{\chi} plays the role of a generalised matter
parity. We present an example which, after imposing a Z_2 monodromy, has a
U(1)_{\perp}^2 family symmetry. Even in the absence of flux, spontaneous
breaking of the family symmetry leads to viable quark, charged lepton and
neutrino masses and mixing. The second possibility has an R-parity associated
with the symmetry of the underlying compactification manifold and the flux. We
construct an example of a model with viable masses and mixing angles based on
the gauge group SU(5)\times SU(5)_{\perp} with a U(1)_{\perp}^3 family symmetry

Non-rigid theories, like ring theory, certain general enough pseudo-topologies,
