analyzed using Wald formalism. These metrics exhibit a quite non-trivial

depending on the geometry of the corresponding base manifolds. Therefore, the

support non-vanishing torsion. Eventually, the possibility to define a sort of

device involves a bubble generation section and a gas removal section. In the
bubble generation section, a T-junction is used to generate a train of gas
plugs into a water stream. These gas plugs are then transported towards the gas
removal section, where they slide along a hydrophobic membrane until complete
removal. The system has been successfully modeled and four necessary operating
criteria have been determined to achieve a complete separation of the gas from
the liquid. The first criterion is that the bubble length needs to be larger
than the channel diameter. The second criterion is that the gas plug should
stay on the membrane for a time sufficient to transport all the gas through the
membrane. The third criterion is that the gas plug travel speed should be lower
than a critical value: otherwise a stable liquid film between the bubble and
the membrane prevents mass transfer. The fourth criterion is that the pressure
difference across the membrane should not be larger than the Laplace pressure
to prevent water from leaking through the membrane.

compensate them in the charge state (+1) form a nonstoichiometric simple cubic
lattice with translational period R_h = [(1 + K)N]^{-1/3} within the

thermally activated accidental coincidence of the acceptor levels in charge
states (0) and (-1). Donors block the fraction K/(1 - K) of impurity lattice
sites. The hole hopping conductivity is averaged over all possible orientations
of the lattice with respect to the external electric field direction. It is
supposed that an acceptor band is formed by Gaussian fluctuations of the
potential energy of boron atoms in charge state (-1) due to Coulomb interaction
only between the ions at distance R_h. The shift of the acceptor band towards
the top of the valence band with increasing N due to screening (in the

papers we described the development of MAESTRO, a low Mach number stellar
hydrodynamics code that can be used to simulate long-time, low-speed flows that
would be prohibitively expensive to model using traditional compressible codes.
MAESTRO is based on an equation set derived using low Mach number asymptotics;
this equation set does not explicitly track acoustic waves and thus allows a
significant increase in the time step. MAESTRO is suitable for two- and
three-dimensional local atmospheric flows as well as three-dimensional
full-star flows. Here, we continue the development of MAESTRO by incorporating
adaptive mesh refinement (AMR). The primary difference between MAESTRO and
other structured grid AMR approaches for incompressible and low Mach number
flows is the presence of the time-dependent base state, whose evolution is
coupled to the evolution of the full solution. We also describe how to
incorporate the expansion of the base state for full-star flows, which involves
a novel mapping technique between the one-dimensional base state and the
Cartesian grid, as well as a number of overall improvements to the algorithm.
We examine the efficiency and accuracy of our adaptive code, and demonstrate
that it is suitable for further study of our initial scientific application,

hexagonal crystalline order and strongly insulating behavior with resistance

fluoride is well described by variable-range hopping in two dimensions due to
the presence of localized states in the band gap. Graphene obtained through the
reduction of graphene fluoride is highly conductive, exhibiting a resistivity
of less than 100 k$\Omega$ at room temperature. Our approach provides a new
path to reversibly engineer the band structure and conductivity of graphene for
electronic and optical applications.

equipped with an action of $A$. There exists a classifying ring $L^A$ of formal
$A$-modules. This paper proves structural results about $L^A$ and about the
moduli stack $\mathcal{M}_{fmA}$ of formal $A$-modules. We use these structural
results to aid in explicit calculations of flat cohomology groups of
$\mathcal{M}_{fmA}^{2-buds}$, the moduli stack of formal $A$-module $2$-buds.
For example, we find that a generator of the group
$H^1_{fl}(\mathcal{M}_{fm\mathbb{Z}}; \omega)$, which also generates (via the
Adams-Novikov spectral sequence) the first stable homotopy group of spheres,
also yields a generator of the $A$-module $H^1_{fl}(\mathcal{M}_{fmA}^{2-buds};
\omega)$ for any torsion-free Noetherian commutative ring $A$. We show that the
order of the $A$-modules $H^1_{fl}(\mathcal{M}_{fmA}^{2-buds}; \omega)$ and
$H^2_{fl}(\mathcal{M}_{fmA}^{2-buds}; \omega\otimes \omega)$ are each equal to
$2^{N_1}$, where $N_1$ is the leading coefficient in the $2$-local
zeta-function of $Spec A$. We also find that the cohomology of
$\mathcal{M}_{fmA}^{2-buds}$ is closely connected to the delta-invariant and
syzygetic ideals studied in commutative algebra:
$H^0_{fl}(\mathcal{M}_{fmA}^{2-buds}; \omega\otimes \omega)$ is the
delta-invariant of the largest ideal of $A$ which is in the kernel of every
ring homomorphism $A\rightarrow \mathbb{F}_2$, and consequently
$H^0_{fl}(\mathcal{M}_{fmA}^{2-buds}; \omega\otimes \omega)$ vanishes if and

over the source excitation and hence the input impedance. The behavior of
quality factor (Q) and bandwidths of the antenna is studied with the use of
input impedance as a function of frequency. We illustrate that by embedding a
dipole antenna inside a core-shell structure, with magnetic shell and
dielectric core, a Q as low as the Chu limit can be approached. The obtained
observations demonstrate how a resonator composed of magnetic shells can

zone. A flux tube is assumed to lie initially near the top of the stably
stratified radiative core below the convection zone, but a segment of it is
perturbed into the convection zone by gradual heating and convective overshoot
motions. The ends (""footpoints"") of the segment remain anchored at the base of
the convection zone, and if the segment is sufficiently long, it may be
buoyantly unstable, rising through the convection zone in a short time. The
length of the flux tube determines the ratio of buoyancy to magnetic tension:
short loops of flux are arrested before reaching the top of the convection
zone, while longer loops emerge to erupt through the photosphere. Using
Spruit's convection zone model, we compute the minimum footpoint separation
$L_c$ required for erupting flux tubes. We explore the dependence of $L_c$ on
the initial thermal state of the perturbed flux tube segment and on its initial
magnetic field strength. Following an investigation of thermal diffusion time
scales and the dynamic rise times of unstable flux tube segments, we conclude
that the most likely origin for magnetic flux which erupts to the surface is
from short length scale perturbations ($L < L_c$) which are initially stable,
but which are subsequently destabilized either by diffusion of heat into the
tube or by stretching of the anchor points until $L$ just exceeds $L_c$. In
either case, the separation of the anchor points of the emergent tube should
lie between the critical distance for a tube in mechanical equilibrium and one
in thermal equilibrium. Finally, after comparing the dispersion of dynamic rise
times with the much shorter observed active region formation time scales, we
conclude that active regions form from the emergence of a single flux tube
segment.

An ordinary triple
point $p$ of the cylinder is called {\em coherent} if all three branches
intersect at $p$ pairwise with the same index. A {\em triple unknotting} of a
classical knot $K$ is a homotopy which connects $K$ with the trivial knot and
which has as singularities only coherent triple points. We give a new formula
for the first Vassiliev invariant $v_2(K)$ by using triple unknottings. As a
corollary we obtain a very simple proof of the fact that passing a coherent
triple point always changes the knot type. As another corollary we show that
there are triple unknottings which are not homotopic as triple unknottings even
if we allow more complicated singularities to appear in the homotopy of the
homotopy.

thermodynamical framework - complex systems in particular - it might be
necessary to introduce generalized entropies, $S_g$. A series of such entropies
have been proposed in the past, mainly to accommodate important empirical
distribution functions to a maximum ignorance principle. Until now the
understanding of the fundamental origin of these entropies and its deeper
relations to complex systems is limited. Here we explore this questions from
first principles. We start by observing that the 4th Khinchin axiom
(separability axiom) is violated by strongly interacting systems in general and
ask about the consequences of violating the 4th axiom while assuming the first
three Khinchin axioms (K1-K3) to hold and $S_g=\sum_ig(p_i)$. We prove by
simple scaling arguments that under these requirements {\em each} statistical
system is uniquely characterized by a distinct pair of scaling exponents
$(c,d)$ in the large size limit. The exponents define equivalence classes for
all interacting and non interacting systems. This allows to derive a unique
entropy, $S_{c,d}\propto \sum_i \Gamma(d+1, 1- c \ln p_i)$, which covers all
entropies which respect K1-K3 and can be written as $S_g=\sum_ig(p_i)$. Known
entropies can now be classified within these equivalence classes. The
corresponding distribution functions are special forms of Lambert-$W$
exponentials containing as special cases Boltzmann, stretched exponential and
Tsallis distributions (power-laws) -- all widely abundant in nature. This is,
to our knowledge, the first {\em ab initio} justification for the existence of
generalized entropies. Even though here we assume $S_g=\sum_ig(p_i)$, we show
that more general entropic forms can be classified along the same lines.

into a cold electron-proton plasma is calculated and analyzed. A qualitative
discussion of the physics of relativistic and non relativistic shocks,
including order of magnitude estimates for the relevant temperature and length
scales, is presented. Detailed numerical solutions are derived for shock
Lorentz factors $\Gamma_u$ in the range $6\le\Gamma_u\le30$, using a novel
iteration technique solving the hydrodynamics and radiation transport equations
(the protons, electrons and positrons are argued to be coupled by collective
plasma processes and are treated as a fluid). The shock transition
(deceleration) region, where the Lorentz factor $ \Gamma $ drops from $
\Gamma_u $ to $ \sim 1 $, is characterized by high plasma temperatures $ T\sim
\Gamma m_ec^2 $ and highly anisotropic radiation, with characteristic
shock-frame energy of upstream and downstream going photons of a few~$\times\,
m_ec^2$ and $\sim \Gamma^2 m_ec^2$, respectively.Photon scattering is dominated
by e$^\pm$ pairs, with pair to proton density ratio reaching
$\approx10^2\Gamma_u$. The width of the deceleration region, in terms of
Thomson optical depths for upstream going photons, is large,
$\Delta\tau\sim\Gamma_u^2$ ($\Delta\tau\sim1$ neglecting the contribution of
pairs) due to Klein Nishina suppression of the scattering cross section. A high
energy photon component, narrowly beamed in the downstream direction, with a
nearly flat power-law like spectrum, $\nu I_\nu\propto\nu^0$, and an energy
cutoff at $ \sim \Gamma_u^2 m_ec^2 $ carries a fair fraction of the energy flux
at the end of the deceleration region. An approximate analytic model of RRMS,
reproducing the main features of the numerical results, is provided.

the corona, and the optical/UV radiation from the disk is usually described by
the anticorrelation between the UV to X-ray slope alpha_ox and the UV
luminosity. Many factors can affect this relation, including: enhanced X-ray
emission associated with the jets of radio-loud AGNs; X-ray absorption
associated with the UV Broad Absorption Line (BAL) outflows; other X-ray
absorption not associated with BALs; intrinsic X-ray weakness; UV and X-ray
variability, and non-simultaneity of UV and X-ray observations. The separation
of these effects provides information about the intrinsic alpha_ox-L_UV
relation and its dispersion, constraining models of disk-corona coupling. We
extract simultaneous data from the second XMM-Newton serendipitous source
catalogue and the XMM-Newton Optical Monitor Serendipitous UV Source Survey
Catalog, and derive the single-epoch alpha_ox indices. We use ensemble
structure functions to analyse multi-epoch data. We confirm the anticorrelation
of alpha_ox with L_UV, and do not find any evidence of a dependence of alpha_ox
on z. The dispersion in our simultaneous data (0.12) is not significantly
smaller than in previous non-simultaneous studies, suggesting that ""artificial
alpha_ox variability"" introduced by non-simultaneity is not the main cause of
dispersion. ""Intrinsic alpha_ox variability"", i.e., the true variability of the
X-ray to optical ratio, is instead important, and accounts for ~30% of the
total variance, or more. ""Inter-source dispersion"", due to intrinsic
differences in the average alpha_ox values from source to source, is also
important. The dispersion introduced by variability is mostly caused by the
long timescale variations, which are expected to be driven by the optical
variations.
