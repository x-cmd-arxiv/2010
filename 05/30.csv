strongly dispersive and roughly transparent for some finite bandwidth.
Relationships and intuitive models that are satisfactory when it is reasonable
to neglect dispersion may then fail. We analyze three such cases of failure.
  First, a simple generalization of the Abraham and Minkowski momenta to
dispersive media entails multiplying each per-photon momentum by $n/n_g$, where
$n$ is the refractive index and $n_g$ is the group index. The resulting forms
are experimentally relevant for the case of the Abraham momentum, but not for
the Minkowski momentum. We show how dispersion modulates the displacement of a
sphere embedded in a dispersive medium by a pulse.
  Second, pulse transformation in a nonstationary medium is modulated by the
presence of dispersion. Using an explicit description of the kinetics of
dispersive nonstationary inhomogeneous media, we show how the group velocity
can modulate pulse response to a change in the refractive index and how Doppler
shifts may become large in a dispersive medium as the velocity of the Doppler
shifting surface approaches the group velocity. We explain a simple way to use
existing technology to either compress or decompress a given pulse, changing
its bandwidth and spatial extent by several orders of magnitude while otherwise
preserving its envelope shape.
  Finally, we note that the nature of a single optical cavity quasimode depends
on intracavity dispersion. We show that the quantum field noise associated with
a single cavity mode may be modulated by dispersion. For a well-chosen mode in
a high-Q cavity, this can amount to either an increase or a decrease in total
vacuum field energy by several orders of magnitude. We focus on the ""white
light cavity,"" showing that the quantum noise of an ideal white light cavity
diverges as the cavity finesse improves.

  lithium burning","This paper has been withdrawn by the authors. Initially submitted to
  ApJ, now combined with JFM publication",,,,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The simplest interior magnetic field B_i that can explain the observed
uniform rotation of the Sun's radiative envelope is an axial dipole stabilized
by a deep toroidal field. It can explain the uniform rotation only if confined
in the polar caps. The field must be prevented from diffusing up into the
high-latitude convection zone, whose slower rotation must remain decoupled from
the radiative interior. This paper describes new analytical and numerical
solutions of the relevant magnetohydrodynamic equations showing that such
confinement and decoupling is dynamically possible by means of a laminar
""magnetic confinement layer"" at the bottom of the tachocline. With realistic
values of the microscopic diffusivities, a weak laminar downwelling flow
U~10^{-5}cm/s over the poles is enough to enforce exponential decay of B_i with
altitude, in a confinement layer only a fraction of a megameter thick.
Downwelling in the polar tachocline is implied both by helioseismic
observations, combined with elementary dynamics, and by theoretical arguments
about the ""gyroscopic pumping"" that would spread differential rotation downward
in the absence of B_i. Our confinement-layer solutions are the first to take
account of all the relevant physical effects in a self-consistent mathematical
model. The effects include magnetic diffusion, baroclinicity and stable
stratification (thermal and compositional), Coriolis effects, and thermal
relaxation. We discuss how the confinement layers at each pole might fit into a
global dynamical picture of the solar tachocline. That picture, in turn,
suggests a new insight into the early Sun and solar lithium depletion.

convection zone in all latitudes, including the polar caps. Axisymmetric
nonlinear MHD solutions are obtained showing that such confinement can be
brought about by a very weak downwelling flow U~10^{-5}cm/s over each pole.
Such downwelling is consistent with the helioseismic evidence. All three
components of the magnetic field decay exponentially with altitude across a
thin ""magnetic confinement layer"" located at the bottom of the tachocline. With
realistic parameter values, the thickness of the confinement layer ~10^{-3} of
the Sun's radius. Alongside baroclinic effects and stable thermal
stratification, the solutions take into account the stable compositional
stratification of the helium settling layer, if present as in today's Sun, and
the small diffusivity of helium through hydrogen, chi. The small value of chi
relative to magnetic diffusivity produces a double boundary-layer structure in
which a ""helium sublayer"" of smaller vertical scale is sandwiched between the
top of the helium settling layer and the rest of the confinement layer.
Solutions are obtained using both semi-analytical and purely numerical,
finite-difference techniques. The confinement-layer flows are magnetostrophic
to excellent approximation. More precisely, the principal force balances are
between Lorentz, Coriolis, pressure-gradient and buoyancy forces, with relative
accelerations and viscous forces negligible. This is despite the kinematic
viscosity being somewhat greater than chi. We discuss how the confinement
layers at each pole might fit into a global dynamical picture of the solar
tachocline. That picture, in turn, suggests a new insight into the early Sun

featured in many contemporary applications. Classical principles of model
selection include the Kullback-Leibler divergence principle and the Bayesian
principle, which lead to the Akaike information criterion and Bayesian
information criterion when models are correctly specified. Yet model
misspecification is unavoidable when we have no knowledge of the true model or
when we have the correct family of distributions but miss some true predictor.
In this paper, we propose a family of semi-Bayesian principles for model
selection in misspecified models, which combine the strengths of the two
well-known principles. We derive asymptotic expansions of the semi-Bayesian
principles in misspecified generalized linear models, which give the new
semi-Bayesian information criteria (SIC). A specific form of SIC admits a
natural decomposition into the negative maximum quasi-log-likelihood, a penalty
on model dimensionality, and a penalty on model misspecification directly.
Numerical studies demonstrate the advantage of the newly proposed SIC
methodology for model selection in both correctly specified and misspecified
models.

analytical tools and specialized Monte Carlo simulations. The model consists of
a penetrable core characterized by a finite repulsive energy combined with a
short-range attractive well. This is a many-body one-dimensional problem,
lacking an exact analytical solution, for which the usual van Hove theorem on
the absence of phase transition does not apply. We determine a
high-penetrability approximation complementing a similar low-penetrability
approximation presented in previous work. This is shown to be equivalent to the
usual Debye-H\""{u}ckel theory for simple charged fluids for which the virial
and energy routes are identical. The internal thermodynamic consistency with
the compressibility route and the validity of the approximation in describing
the radial distribution function is assessed by a comparison against numerical
simulations. The Fisher-Widom line separating the oscillatory and monotonic
large-distance behavior of the radial distribution function is computed within
the high-penetrability approximation and compared with the opposite regime,
thus providing a strong indication of the location of the line in all possible
regimes. The high-penetrability approximation predicts the existence of a
critical point and a spinodal line, but this occurs outside the applicability
domain of the theory. We investigate the possibility of a fluid-fluid
transition by Gibbs ensemble Monte Carlo techniques, not finding any evidence
of such a transition. Additional analytical arguments are given to support this
claim. Finally, we find a clustering transition when Ruelle's stability
criterion is not fulfilled. The consequences of these findings on the
three-dimensional phase diagrams are also discussed.

antiferromagnetic (AFM) chain of Fibonacci anyons on a torus is in the same
universality class as the tricritical Ising model, and that criticality is
protected by a topological symmetry. In the present paper we first review the
graphical formalism for the study of anyons on the disc and demonstrate how
this formalism may be consistently extended to the study of systems on surfaces
of higher genus. We then employ this graphical formalism to study finite rings
of interacting anyons on both the disc and the torus, and show that analysis on
the disc necessarily yields an energy spectrum which is a subset of that which
is obtained on the torus. For a critical Hamiltonian, one may extract from this
subset the scaling dimensions of the local scaling operators which respect the
topological symmetry of the system. Related considerations are also shown to
apply for open chains.

searches a decision space by flying ""probes"" whose trajectories are
deterministically computed using two equations of motion. Because it is
possible for a probe to fly outside the domain of feasible solutions, a simple
errant probe retrieval method has been used previously that does not include
the directional information contained in a probe's acceleration vector. This
note investigates the effect of adding directionality to the ""repositioning

improve convergence speed or accuracy. In fact, adding directionality to the
original errant probe retrieval scheme appears to be highly inadvisable.
Nevertheless, there may be alternative probe retrieval schemes that do benefit
from directional information, and the results reported here may assist in or

resolve singularities, thereby opening new vistas. Examples are: The big bang

after the big bounce, there is a super-inflationary phase with its own
phenomenological ramifications; and, in presence of a standard inflaton
potential, initial conditions are naturally set for a long, slow roll inflation

quasars because quasars with redshift in this range have similar optical colors
as normal stars and are thus difficult to be found in optical sky surveys. A
quasar candidate, SDSS J085543.40-001517.7, which was selected by a recently
proposed criterion involving near-IR $Y-K$ and optical $g-z$ colors, was
identified spectroscopically as a new quasar with redshift of 2.427 by the
LAMOST commissioning observation in December 2009 and confirmed by the
observation made with the NAOC/Xinglong 2.16m telescope in March 2010. This
quasar was not targeted in the SDSS spectroscopic survey because it locates in
the stellar locus of the optical color-color diagrams, while it is clearly
separated from stars in the $Y-K$ vs. $g-z$ diagram. Comparing with other SDSS
quasars we found this new quasar with $i$ magnitude of 16.44 is apparently the
brightest one in the redshift range from 2.3 to 2.7. From the spectral
properties we derived its central black hole mass as $(1.4\sim3.9) \times
10^{10} M_\odot$ and the bolometric luminosity as $3.7\times 10^{48}$ \ergs,
which indicates that this new quasar is intrinsically very bright and belongs
to the most luminous quasars in the universe. Our identification supports that
quasars in the redshift desert can be found by the quasar selection criterion
involving the near-IR colors. More missing quasars are expected to be recovered
by the future LAMOST spectroscopic surveys, which is important to the study of
the cosmological evolution of quasars at redshift higher than 2.2.

computing Nash equilibria of a subclass of generic finite normal form games. We
define ""rational payoff irrational equilibria games"" to be the games with all
rational payoffs and all irrational equilibria. We present a purely algebraic
method for computing all Nash equilibria of these games that uses knowledge of
Galois groups. Some results, showing properties of the class of games, and an
example to show working of the method concludes the paper.

progressed in parallel and remained mostly separate. Here, we employ new tools

sparse reconstruction to advance on an open problem in random pojection. In
particular, we generalize and use an intricate result by Rudelson and Vershynin
for sparse reconstruction which uses Dudley's theorem for bounding Gaussian

vectors in $n$ dimensional space can be linearly mapped to a space of dimension
$k=O(\log N\polylog(n))$, while (1) preserving the pairwise distances among the
vectors to within any constant distortion and (2) being able to apply the
transformation in time $O(n\log n)$ on each vector. This improves on the best
known $N = \exp(\tilde{O}(n^{1/2}))$ achieved by Ailon and Liberty and $N =
\exp(\tilde{O}(n^{1/3}))$ by Ailon and Chazelle.

suboptimal and subject to further investigation. For constant distortion, this
settles the open question posed by these authors up to a $\polylog(n)$ factor

rolls are born from the conduction state through a pitchfork bifurcation at

successively to time-periodic and quasiperiodic rolls through Hopf and
Neimark-Sacker bifurcations at $r \simeq 80$ and $r \simeq 500 $ respectively.
The system becomes chaotic at $r \simeq 750$ through a quasiperiodic route to
chaos. The size of the chaotic attractor increases at $r \simeq 840$ through an
""attractor-merging crisis"" which also results in travelling chaotic rolls. We
also observe coexistence of stable fixed points and a chaotic attractor for $
846 \le r \le 849$ as a result of a subcritical Hopf bifurcation. Subsequently
the chaotic attractor disappears through a ""boundary crisis"" and only stable
fixed points remain. Later these fixed points become periodic and chaotic
through another set of bifurcations which ultimately leads to turbulence.

a corollary, we provide asymptotically sharp bounds on the size of the lists
required to assure the existence of such unique-maximum colorings for many
geometric hypergraphs (e.g., discs or pseudo-discs in the plane or points with
respect to discs). Moreover, we provide an algorithm, such that, given a family

that h=1/2, i.e. the beneficial allele is co-dominant. We complement existing
theory for selective sweeps by assuming that h is any value in [0,1]. We show
that genetic diversity patters under selective sweeps with strength s and
dominance 0<h<1 are similar to co-dominant sweeps with selection strength 2hs.
Moreover, we focus on the case h=0 of a completely recessive beneficial allele.
We find that the length of the sweep, i.e. the time from occurrence until
fixation of the beneficial allele, is of the order of sqrt(N/s) generations, if
N is the population size. Simulations as well as our results show that genetic
diversity patterns in the recessive case h=0 greatly differ from all other
cases.

with the matter field F-term as a source of supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking and
uplifting. Two models of F-term SUSY breaking are considered: the Polonyi model
and the quantum corrected O'Raifeartaigh model. In the former case, both
classes of racetrack inflation models differ significantly from the
corresponding models with non-SUSY uplifting. The main difference is a quite
strong dominance of the inflaton by the matter field. In addition, fine-tuning
of the parameters is relaxed as compared to the original racetrack models. In
the case of the racetrack inflation models coupled to the O'Raifeartaigh model,
the matter field is approximately decoupled from the inflationary dynamics.

to explain stock returns. The rapid development of derivative markets has led
to the possibility of trading various kinds of risks, such as credit and
interest rate risk, separately from each other. This paper uses credit default
swaps and equity options to determine risk premia which are then used to form
portfolios that are regressed against the returns of stock portfolios. It turns
out that both, credit risk and implied volatility, have high explanatory power
in regard to stock returns. Especially the returns of distressed stocks are
highly dependent on credit risk fluctuations. This finding leads to practical
implications, such as cross-hedging opportunities between equity and credit
instruments and potentially allows forecasting stock returns based on movements
in the credit market.

applied to investigate the nonlinear interactions of periodic traveling waves.
Mathematically, this method does not depend upon any small physical parameters
at all and thus is more general than the traditional multiple-scale
perturbation techniques. Physically, it is found that, for a fully developed
wave system, the amplitudes of all wave components are finite even if the wave
resonance condition given by Phillips (1960) is exactly satisfied. Besides, it
is revealed that there exist multiple resonant waves, and that the amplitudes
of resonant wave may be much smaller than those of primary waves so that the
resonant waves sometimes contain rather small part of wave energy. Furthermore,
a wave resonance condition for arbitrary numbers of traveling waves with large
wave amplitudes is given, which logically contains Phillips' four-wave
resonance condition but opens a way to investigate the strongly nonlinear
interaction of more than four traveling waves with large amplitudes. This work
also illustrates that the homotopy multiple-variable method is helpful to gain
solutions with important physical meanings of nonlinear problems, if the
multiple variables are properly defined with clear physical meanings.

lattice and the magnetic flux dynamics in type-II superconductors are examined
by a direct variational optimisation method and widespread physical principles.
Our method allows to unify a number of conventional models describing the
complex vortex configurations in the critical state regime. Special attention
is given to the discussion of the relation between the flux-line cutting
mechanism and the depinning threshold limitation. This is done by using a
smooth double critical state concept which incorporates the so-called
isotropic, elliptical, T and CT models as well-defined limits of our general
treatment. Starting from different initial configurations for a superconducting
slab in a 3D magnetic field, we show that the predictions of the theory range
from the collapse to zero of transverse magnetic moments in the isotropic
model, to nearly force free configurations in which paramagnetic values can
arbitrarily increase with the applied field for magnetically anisotropic
current voltage laws. Noteworthily, the differences between the several model
predictions are minimal for the low applied field regime.

theory, which are the Gauss-Bonnet gravity duals of a pair of field theories. A
string with both endpoints on the same side of the wormhole describes two
charges within the same field theory, which exhibit Coulomb interaction for
small separation. On the other hand, a string extending through the wormhole
describes two charges which live in different field theories, and they exhibit
a spring-like confining potential. A transition occurs when there is a pair of
charges present within each field theory: for small separation each pair of
charges exhibits Coulomb interaction, while for large separation the charges in
the different field theories pair up and exhibit confinement. If two charges
move faster than a critical speed, then they exhibit a separation gap and
energy is transferred from the leading charge to the lagging one.
