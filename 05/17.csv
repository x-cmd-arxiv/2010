the velocity and magnetic-field fluctuations) can play an important role in
several magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) plasma phenomena such as the global
magnetic-field generation, turbulence suppression, etc. Despite its relevance
to the cross-helicity evolution, little attention has been paid to the
dissipation rate of the turbulent cross helicity, $\epsilon_W$. In this paper,
we consider the model expression for the dissipation rate of the turbulent
cross helicity. In addition to the algebraic model, an evolution equation of
$\epsilon_W$ is proposed on the basis of the statistical analytical theory of
inhomogeneous turbulence. A turbulence model with the modeling of $\epsilon_W$
is applied to the solar-wind turbulence. Numerical results on the large-scale
evolution of the cross helicity is compared with the satellite observations. It
is shown that, as far as the solar-wind application is concerned, the simplest
possible algebraic model for $\epsilon_W$ is sufficient for elucidating the
large-scale spatial evolution of the solar-wind turbulence. Dependence of the
cross-helicity evolution on the large-scale velocity structures such as
velocity shear and flow expansion is also discussed.

the strength of the {\chi}(3) nonlinearity; (ii) periodic modulation of the

within the framework of phase-space quantum distributions. It is demonstrated
that the Wigner functions of oscillatory mode in both bistable and chaotic

M has pro-monomorphic fundamental group at infinity which is not pro-trivial

non-manifold case, Wright's method showed that when a one-ended, simply
connected, locally compact ANR X with pro-monomorphic fundamental group at
infinity admits an action of Z by covering transformations then the fundamental
group at infinity of X is (up to pro-isomorphism) an inverse sequence of
finitely generated free groups. We improve upon this latter result, by showing
that X must have a stable finitely generated free fundamental group at
infinity. Simple examples show that a free group of any finite rank is
possible. We also prove that if X (as above), admits a non-cocompact action of
Z+Z by covering transformations, then X is simply connected at infinity.
Corollary: Every finitely presented one-ended group G which contains an element
of infinite order satisfies exactly one of the following: 1) G is simply
connected at infinity; 2) G is virtually a surface group; 3) The fundamental
group at infinity of G is not pro-monomorphic. Our methods also provide a quick

classes in a finite Weyl group W. We say that an admissible diagram \Gamma is a
Carter diagram if any edge {\alpha, \beta} with inner product (\alpha, \beta) >
0 (resp. (\alpha, \beta) < 0) is drawn as dotted (resp. solid) edge. We
construct an explicit transformation of any Carter diagram containing long
cycles (with the number of vertices l > 4) into another Carter diagram
containing only 4-cycles. Thus, all Carter diagrams containing long cycles can
be eliminated from the classification list. There exist diagrams determining
two conjugacy classes in W.It is shown that any connected Carter diagram \Gamma
containing a 4-vertex pattern D_4 or D_4(a_1) determines a single conjugacy
class. The main approach is studying different extensions of Carter diagrams.
Let \tilde{\Gamma} be the Carter diagram obtained from a certain Carter diagram
\Gamma by adding a single vertex \alpha connected to \Gamma at n points, n \leq
3. Let a socket be the set of vertices of \Gamma connected to \alpha. If the
number of sockets available for extensions is equal to 2, then there is a pair
of extensions \Gamma < \tilde{\Gamma}_L and \Gamma < \tilde{\Gamma}_R, called
mirror extensions and the pair elements w_L and w_R associated with
\tilde{\Gamma}_L and \tilde{\Gamma}_R. We show that w_R = T^{-1}w_L{T} for some
T \in W, where the map T is explicitly constructed for all mirror extensions.
In Carter's description of the conjugacy classes in a Weyl group a key result
(Carter's theorem) states that every element in a Weyl group is a product of
two involutions. One of the goals of this paper and its sequels is to prepare
the notions and framework in which we give the proof of this fact without
appealing to the classification of conjugacy classes.

filters F098M (Ys), F125W (J), and F160W (H) with 1-2 HST orbits per filter.
Together with the existing HST Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) GOODS-South
mosaics in the BViz filters, these panchromatic 10-band ERS data cover 40-50
square arcmin at 0.2-1.7 {\mu}m in wavelength at 0.07-0.15"" FWHM resolution and
0.090"" Multidrizzled pixels to depths of AB\simeq 26.0-27.0 mag (5-{\sigma})
for point sources, and AB\simeq 25.5-26.5 mag for compact galaxies.
  In this paper, we describe: a) the scientific rationale, and the data taking
plus reduction procedures of the panchromatic 10-band ERS mosaics; b) the
procedure of generating object catalogs across the 10 different ERS filters,
and the specific star-galaxy separation techniques used; and c) the reliability
and completeness of the object catalogs from the WFC3 ERS mosaics. The
excellent 0.07-0.15"" FWHM resolution of HST/WFC3 and ACS makes star- galaxy
separation straightforward over a factor of 10 in wavelength to AB\simeq 25-26
mag from the UV to the near-IR, respectively.

have any definition of theory space which can be used to make such arguments.
In this talk, we will describe various concepts and tools which should be
developed for this purpose, inspired by the analogous mathematical problem of
studying the space of Riemannian manifolds. We state two general conjectures
about the space of two-dimensional conformal field theories, and we define a
distance function on this space, which gives a distance between any pair of

time cut-off in the bulk to a short distance cut-off on the future boundary.
The light-cone time of an event is defined in terms of the volume of its future
light-cone on the boundary. We seek an intrinsic definition of boundary volumes
that makes no reference to bulk structures. This requires taming the fractal
geometry of the future boundary, and lifting the ambiguity of the conformal
factor. We propose to work in the conformal frame in which the boundary Ricci
scalar is constant. We explore this proposal in the FRW approximation for
bubble universes. Remarkably, we find that the future boundary becomes a round
three-sphere, with smooth metric on all scales. Our cut-off yields the same
relative probabilities as a previous proposal that defined boundary volumes by
projection into the bulk along timelike geodesics. Moreover, it is equivalent
to an ensemble of causal patches defined without reference to bulk geodesics.
It thus yields a holographically motivated and phenomenologically successful
measure for eternal inflation.

Fredholm operators. After a Liapunov-Schmidt reduction, these waves are
obtained via the Banach contraction principle, as perturbations of a positive

existence is proven under some requirements. By a careful analysis of the
exponential decay of the travelling wave profiles at $-\infty$, their
positiveness is deduced. The existence of positive travelling waves is
important in terms of applications to biological models. Our method applies to

the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) as observed with the Herschel Space
Observatory. N49 is unusually bright because of an interaction with a molecular
cloud along its eastern edge. We have used PACS and SPIRE to measure the far IR
flux densities of the entire SNR and of a bright region on the eastern edge of
the SNR where the SNR shock is encountering the molecular cloud. Using these
fluxes supplemented with archival data at shorter wavelengths, we estimate the
dust mass associated with N49 to be about 10 Msun. The bulk of the dust in our
simple two-component model has a temperature of 20-30 K, similar to that of
nearby molecular clouds. Unfortunately, as a result of the limited angular
resolution of Herschel at the wavelengths sampled with SPIRE, the uncertainties
are fairly large. Assuming this estimate of the dust mass associated with the
SNR is approximately correct, it is probable that most of the dust in the SNR
arises from regions where the shock speed is too low to produce significant
X-ray emission. The total amount of warm 50-60 K dust is ~0.1 or 0.4 Msun,
depending on whether the dust is modeled in terms of carbonaceous or silicate
grains. This provides a firm lower limit to the amount of shock heated dust in

subject to either an external forcing or a coupling function of their internal
variables can be inferred from the behavior of a single element in the system,
which can be seen as a single drive-response map. From the conditions for
stable synchronization in this single driven-map model with minimal
ingredients, we find minimal conditions for the emergence of complete and
generalized chaos synchronization in both driven and autonomous associated
systems. Our results show that the presence of a common drive or a coupling
function for all times is not indispensable for reaching synchronization in a
system of chaotic oscillators, nor is the simultaneous sharing of a field,
either external or endogenous, by all the elements. In the case of an
autonomous system, the coupling function does not need to depend on all the
internal variables for achieving synchronization and its functional form is not
crucial for generalized synchronization. What becomes essential for reaching
synchronization in an extended system is the sharing of some minimal
information by its elements, on the average, over long times, independently of
the nature (external or internal) of its source.

giving a little more preference to the opinion $\sigma = 1$. It is found that
as $p$ becomes larger, introducing more complicated pattern of information flow
channels, and as the network size $N$ becomes larger, the system eventually
evolves to the state in which more voters agree on the better opinion, even
though the voter at the top of the hierarchy keeps the worse opinion. We also
find that the pure hierarchical tree makes opinion agreement very fast, while
the final absorbing state can easily be influenced by voters at the higher

existence of complicated pattern of bidirectional information flow allows the

routing and multicasting is to conserve as much energy as possible without
compromising path efficiency measured as end-to-end delay. In this paper, we
address the problem of path efficient and energy aware multicasting in static
wireless ad hoc networks. We propose a novel distributed scalable algorithm for
finding a virtual multicast backbone (VMB). Based on this VMB, we have further
developed a multicasting scheme that jointly improves path efficiency and
energy conservation. By exploiting inherent broadcast advantage of wireless
communication and employing a more realistic energy consumption model for
wireless communication which not only depends on radio propagation losses but
also on energy losses in transceiver circuitry, our simulation results show
that the proposed VMB-based multicasting scheme outperforms existing prominent
tree based energy conserving, path efficient multicasting schemes.

expected in massive star formation. We study the evolution of massive
protostars at such high rates by numerically solving the stellar structure
equations. In this paper we examine the evolution via disk accretion. We
consider a limiting case of ""cold"" disk accretion, whereby most of the stellar
photosphere can radiate freely with negligible backwarming from the accretion
flow, and the accreting material settles onto the star with the same specific
entropy as the photosphere. We compare our results to the calculated evolution
via spherically symmetric accretion, the opposite limit, whereby the material
accreting onto the star contains the entropy produced in the accretion shock
front. We examine how different accretion geometries affect the evolution of
massive protostars. For cold disk accretion at 10^-3 M_sun/yr the radius of a
protostar is initially small, about a few R_sun. After several solar masses
have accreted, the protostar begins to bloat up and for M \simeq 10 M_sun the
stellar radius attains its maximum of 30 - 400 R_sun. The large radius about
100 R_sun is also a feature of spherically symmetric accretion at the same
accreted mass and accretion rate. Hence, expansion to a large radius is a
robust feature of accreting massive protostars. At later times the protostar
eventually begins to contract and reaches the Zero-Age Main-Sequence (ZAMS) for
M \simeq 30 M_sun, independent of the accretion geometry. For accretion rates
exceeding several 10^-3 M_sun/yr the protostar never contracts to the ZAMS. The
very large radius of several 100s R_sun results in a low effective temperature
and low UV luminosity of the protostar. Such bloated protostars could well
explain the existence of bright high-mass protostellar objects, which lack
detectable HII regions.

the k_T- and collinear factorizations for the DIS structure functions by
consecutive reductions of a more general theoretical construction. We begin by
studying the amplitude of the forward Compton scattering off a hadron target,
representing this amplitude as a set of convolutions of two blobs connected by
the simplest, two-parton intermediate states. Each blob in the convolutions can
contain both the perturbative and non-perturbative contributions. We formulate
conditions for separating the perturbative and non-perturbative contributions
and attributing them to the different blobs. After that the convolutions
correspond to the QCD factorization. Then we reduce this totally unintegrated
(basic) factorization first to the k_T- factorization and finally to the
collinear factorization. In order to yield a finite expression for the Compton
amplitude, the integration over the loop momentum in the basic factorization
must be free of both ultraviolet and infrared singularities. This obvious
mathematical requirement leads to theoretical restrictions on the
non-perturbative contributions (parton distributions) to the Compton amplitude
and the DIS structure functions related to the Compton amplitude through the
Optical theorem. In particular, our analysis excludes the use of the singular
factors x^{-a} (with a > 0) in the fits for the quark and gluon distributions
because such factors contradict to the integrability of the basic convolutions
for the Compton amplitude. This restriction is valid for all DIS structure
functions in the framework of both the k_T- factorization and the collinear
factorization if we attribute the perturbative contributions only to the upper
blob.

superconductors that are artificially drilled along their c-axis. The influence
of the hole pattern on the magnetization is studied and compared by means of
numerical models and Hall probe mapping techniques. To this aim, we consider
two bulk YBCO samples with a rectangular cross-section that are drilled each by
six holes arranged either on a rectangular lattice (sample I) or on a centered
rectangular lattice (sample II). For the numerical analysis, three different
models are considered for calculating the trapped flux: (i), a two-dimensional
(2D) Bean model neglecting demagnetizing effects and flux creep, (ii), a 2D
finite-element model neglecting demagnetizing effects but incorporating
magnetic relaxation in the form of an E-J power law, and, (iii), a 3D finite
element analysis that takes into account both the finite height of the sample
and flux creep effects. For the experimental analysis, the trapped magnetic
flux density is measured above the sample surface by Hall probe mapping
performed before and after the drilling process. The maximum trapped flux
density in the drilled samples is found to be smaller than that in the plain
samples. The smallest magnetization drop is found for sample II, with the
centered rectangular lattice. This result is confirmed by the numerical models.
In each sample, the relative drops that are calculated independently with the
three different models are in good agreement. As observed experimentally, the
magnetization drop calculated in the sample II is the smallest one and its
relative value is comparable to the measured one. By contrast, the measured
magnetization drop in sample (1) is much larger than that predicted by the
simulations, most likely because of a change of the microstructure during the
drilling process.

for the build up of the s-elements at Halo metallicities. The effect is
noticeable only for the highest 13C-pocket efficiencies (cases ST*2 and ST).
For Galactic disc metallicities, the bug effect is negligible. A comparative
analysis of the neutron poison effect of other primary isotopes (12C, 22Ne and
its progenies) is presented. The effect of proton captures, by 14N(n, p)14C,
boosts a primary production of Fluorine in Halo AGB stars, with [F/Fe]
comparable to [C/Fe], without affecting the s-elements production.

render mu mu -> W W less promising, even though this process is not constrained

responsible for inverse neutrino-less double beta decay, observable signals are

bolometric output of starburst galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGN) by
directly sampling the peak of their far-infrared (IR) emission. Here we examine
whether the spectral energy distribution (SED) and dust temperature of galaxies
have strongly evolved since z~2.5. We use Herschel deep extragalactic surveys
from 100 to 500um to compute total IR luminosities in galaxies down to the
faintest levels, using PACS and SPIRE in the GOODS-North field (PEP and HerMES
key programs). We show that measurements in the SPIRE bands can be used below
the statistical confusion limit if information at higher spatial resolution is
used to identify isolated galaxies whose flux is not boosted by bright
neighbors. Below z~1.5, mid-IR extrapolations are correct for star-forming
galaxies with a dispersion of only 40% (0.15dex), therefore similar to z~0
galaxies. This narrow distribution is puzzling when considering the range of
physical processes that could have affected the SED of these galaxies.
Extrapolations from only one of the 160um, 250um or 350um bands alone tend to
overestimate the total IR luminosity. This may be explained by the lack of
far-IR constraints around and above ~150um (rest-frame) on local templates. We
also note that the dust temperature of luminous IR galaxies around z~1 is
mildly colder by 10-15% than their local analogs and up to 20% for ULIRGs at
z~1.6. Above z=1.5, distant galaxies are found to exhibit a substantially
larger mid- over far-IR ratio, which could either result from stronger broad
emission lines or warm dust continuum heated by a hidden AGN. Two thirds of the
AGNs identified in the field with a measured redshift exhibit the same behavior
as purely star-forming galaxies. Hence a large fraction of AGNs harbor star
formation at very high SFR and in conditions similar to purely star-forming
galaxies.

toward a sample of 43 embedded low-mass young stars in nearby star-forming
regions is presented. The sources are selected from the Spitzer ""Cores to
Disks"" (c2d) legacy program. The environment of embedded protostars is complex
both in its physical structure (envelopes, outflows, jets, protostellar disks)
and the physical processes (accretion, irradiation by UV and/or X-rays,
excitation through slow and fast shocks) which take place. A key point is to
spatially resolve the emission in the Spitzer-IRS spectra. An optimal
extraction method is used to separate both spatially unresolved (compact, up to
a few 100 AU) and spatially resolved (extended, 1000 AU or more) emission from
the IRS spectra. The results are compared with the c2d disk sample and
literature PDR and shock models to address the physical nature of the sources.
Both compact and extended emission features are observed. Warm (Tex few 100 K)
H2, observed through the pure rotational H2 S(0), S(1) and S(2) lines, and [S
I] 25 mu emission is observed primarily in the extended component. [S I] is
observed uniquely toward truly embedded sources and not toward disks. On the
other hand hot (Tex>700 K) H2, observed primarily through the S(4) line, and
[Ne II] emission is seen mostly in the compact component. [Fe II] and [Si II]
lines are observed in both spatial components. Hot H2O emission is found in the
compact component of some sources. The observed emission on >=1000 AU scales is
characteristic of PDR emission and likely originates in the outflow cavities in
the remnant envelope created by the stellar wind and jets from the embedded
young stars. Weak shocks along the outflow wall can also contribute. The
compact emission is likely of mixed origin, comprised of optically thick
circumstellar disk and/or jet/outflow emission from the protostellar object.

direction dependence arising from living off-centre inside a large void, as
well as previously mentioned reasons for anisotropy. We show that for large

We apply our statistics to the gold data sets from \cite{rie04} and
\cite{rie07}, as in our previous work. Our revision and extension of previous

of using its best fit value has only a marginal effect on our results. However,
correction of errors in our previous work reduce the level of non-Gaussianity
in the 2004 gold data that was found in our earlier work. The revised results
for the 2007 gold data show that the data is consistent with isotropy and
Gaussianity. Our second statistic confirms these results.

up to J=8 can be accounted for by UV radiation from star formation. However,
the approximately flat luminosity distribution of the CO lines over the

excitation for the highest CO lines. We explore X-ray heating by the accreting
supermassive black hole in Mrk231 as a source of excitation for these lines,
and find that it can reproduce the observed luminosities. We also consider a
model with dense gas in a strong UV radiation field to produce the highest CO
lines, but find that this model strongly overpredicts the hot dust mass in
Mrk231. Our favoured model consists of a star forming disk of radius 560 pc,
containing clumps of dense gas exposed to strong UV radiation, dominating the
emission of CO lines up to J=8. X-rays from the accreting supermassive black
hole in Mrk231 dominate the excitation and chemistry of the inner disk out to a
radius of 160 pc, consistent with the X-ray power of the AGN in Mrk231. The
extraordinary luminosity of the OH+ and H2O+ lines reveals the signature of

Then, this model is refined using classical techniques such as constraint

to form an improved constraint model that must be thoroughly tested before
being used to address real-sized problems. We think that most of the faults are
introduced in this refinement step and propose a process which takes the first
declarative model as an oracle for detecting non-conformities. We derive
practical test purposes from this process to generate automatically test data
that exhibit non-conformities. We implemented this approach in a new tool

belt. This two-dimensional horizontal setup allows to uncouple pressure and

velocity, independent of the amount of disks in the container and, thus,
independent of the pressure in the outlet region. In addition, this specific
experimental configuration makes it possible to get information on the system
dynamics from a single image of the disks that rest on the conveyor belt after
the discharge.

where communication links can appear or disappear at any time. The nodes in the
network are equipped with hardware clocks, but the rate of the hardware clocks
can vary arbitrarily within specific bounds, and the estimates that nodes can
obtain about the clock values of other nodes are inherently inaccurate. Our
goal in this setting is to output a logical clock at each node such that the
logical clocks of any two nodes are not too far apart, and nodes that remain
close to each other in the network for a long time are better synchronized than
distant nodes. This property is called gradient clock synchronization.
  Gradient clock synchronization has been widely studied in the static setting,
where the network topology does not change. We show that the asymptotically
optimal bounds obtained for the static case also apply to our highly dynamic
setting: if two nodes remain at distance $d$ from each other for sufficiently
long, it is possible to upper bound the difference between their clock values
by $O(d \log (D / d))$, where $D$ is the diameter of the network. This is known
to be optimal even for static networks. Furthermore, we show that our algorithm
has optimal stabilization time: when a path of length $d$ appears between two
nodes, the time required until the clock skew between the two nodes is reduced
to $O(d \log (D / d))$ is $O(D)$, which we prove to be optimal. Finally, the
techniques employed for the more intricate analysis of the algorithm for
dynamic graphs provide additional insights that are also of interest for the
static setting. In particular, we establish self-stabilization of the gradient
property within $O(D)$ time.

An insight into the control mechanism is gained by analyzing the characteristic
equation of the controlled system, showing that the control scheme fails to
control unstable equilibria having an odd number of positive real eigenvalues.
We demonstrate that the method can also stabilize unstable periodic orbits for
a suitable choice of the feedback gain, providing that the time delay is chosen
to coincide with the period of the target orbit. In addition, it is shown
numerically that delayed feedback control with a sinusoidally modulated time

Hermitian matrix $M_n$ whose upper-triangular entries are independent with mean
zero and variance one, and are exponentially decaying. By Wigner's semicircular
law, one expects that $\lambda_i(M_n)$ concentrates around $\gamma_i \sqrt n$,
where $\int_{-\infty}^{\gamma_i} \rho_{sc} (x) dx = \frac{i}{n}$ and
$\rho_{sc}$ is the semicircular function.
  In this paper, we show that if the entries have vanishing third moment, then
for all $1\le i \le n$
  $$\E |\lambda_i(M_n)-\sqrt{n} \gamma_i|^2 = O(\min(n^{-c}
\min(i,n+1-i)^{-2/3} n^{2/3}, n^{1/3+\eps})) ,$$ for some absolute constant
$c>0$ and any absolute constant $\eps>0$. In particular, for the eigenvalues in
the bulk ($\min \{i, n-i\}=\Theta (n)$), $$\E |\lambda_i(M_n)-\sqrt{n}
\gamma_i|^2 = O(n^{-c}). $$
  \noindent A similar result is achieved for the rate of convergence.
  As a corollary, we show that the four moment condition in the Four Moment
Theorem is necessary, in the sense that if one allows the fourth moment to
change (while keeping the first three moments fixed), then the \emph{mean} of
$\lambda_i(M_n)$ changes by an amount comparable to $n^{-1/2}$ on the average.
We make a precise conjecture about how the expectation of the eigenvalues vary

linear spin chains, as a model for quantum communication. Some years ago it was
discovered that when the spin chain data (the nearest neighbour interaction
strengths and the magnetic field strengths) are related to the Jacobi matrix
entries of Krawtchouk polynomials or dual Hahn polynomials, so-called perfect
state transfer takes place. The extension of these ideas to other types of
discrete orthogonal polynomials did not lead to new models with perfect state
transfer, but did allow more insight in the general computation of the
correlation function. In the present paper, we extend the study to discrete
orthogonal polynomials of q-hypergeometric type. A remarkable result is a new
analytic model where perfect state transfer is achieved: this is when the spin
chain data are related to the Jacobi matrix of q-Krawtchouk polynomials. The
other cases studied here (affine q-Krawtchouk polynomials, quantum q-Krawtchouk
polynomials, dual q-Krawtchouk polynomials, q-Hahn polynomials, dual q-Hahn
polynomials and q-Racah polynomials) do not give rise to models with perfect

quite interesting, leading to advanced q-series manipulations.

the X-ray emission of stars hosting planets and find a positive correlation
between X-ray luminosity and the projected mass of the most closely orbiting
exoplanets. We investigate possible systematics and observational biases that
could mimic or confuse this correlation but find no strong evidence for any,

X-ray emission dependent on close-in planetary mass. Under the hypothesis that

account typical thermal conductivities and their temperature dependencies of
all the materials involved in the heat dissipation and its removal. Such mesas
are used in experiments on THz-range radiation. The analysis shows that the
temperature increases with bias current and is distributed unevenly along the
mesas. The temperature of the mesa's middle part can even exceed $T_c$ at
sufficiently high bias. The non-uniform temperature distribution can possibly
be important for synchronization of emission from different junctions in the

competition between the classical and the quantum mechanical back-reactions to
terminate inflation. If one considers only the classical evolution of the
system we show that the highly blue-tilted entropy perturbations induce highly
blue-tilted large scale curvature perturbations during the waterfall phase
transition which dominate over the original adiabatic curvature perturbations.
However, we show that the quantum back-reactions of the waterfall field
inhomogeneities produced during the phase transition dominate completely over
the classical back-reactions. The cumulative quantum back-reactions of very
small scales tachyonic modes terminate inflation very efficiently and shut off
the curvature perturbations evolution during the waterfall phase transition.
This indicates that the standard hybrid inflation model is safe under large
scale curvature perturbations during the waterfall phase transition.

virial temperatures above 10^4 K, can avoid fragmentation and undergo rapid
collapse, possibly resulting in a supermassive black hole (SMBH). This requires
the gas to avoid cooling and to remain at temperatures near T=10^4 K. We show
that this condition can be satisfied in the presence of a sufficiently strong
primordial magnetic field, which heats the collapsing gas via ambipolar
diffusion. If the field has a strength above B = 3.6 (comoving) nG, the
collapsing gas is kept warm (T=10^4K) until it reaches the critical density
n_crit=10^3 cm^{-3} at which the roto-vibrational states of H_2 approach local
thermodynamic equilibrium. H_2-cooling then remains inefficient, and the gas
temperature stays near 10^4K, even as it continues to collapse to higher
densities. The critical magnetic field strength required to permanently
suppress H_2-cooling is somewhat higher than upper limit of approx. 2 nG from
the cosmic microwave background (CMB). However, it can be realized in the rare
(2-3)-sigma regions of the spatially fluctuating B-field; these regions contain
a sufficient number of halos to account for the z=6 quasar BHs.

provides the right building blocks for the rectangular-like bar outline and for
ansae. We consider how our results can be used to give estimates for the
pattern speed values, as well as their effect on abundance gradients in barred
galaxies. We present the kinematics along the manifold loci, to allow
comparisons with the observed kinematics along the ring and spiral loci. We
consider gaseous arms and their relations to stellar ones. We discuss several
theoretical aspects and stress that the orbits that constitute the building
blocks of the spirals and rings are chaotic. They are, nevertheless, spatially
well confined by the manifolds and are thus able to outline the relevant
structures. Such chaos can be termed `confined chaos' and can play a very
important role in understanding the formation and evolution of galaxy
structures and in galactic dynamics in general. This work, in agreement with
several others, argues convincingly that galactic dynamic studies should not be
limited to the study of regular motions and orbits.

plateaus are flat, unlike previous claims for a steep monotonic decrease in Li
abundances with decreasing metallicities. At all metallicities we uncover a
fine-structure in the Li abundances of Spite plateau stars, which we trace to
Li depletion that depends on both metallicity and mass. Models including atomic
diffusion and turbulent mixing seem to reproduce the observed Li depletion
assuming a primordial Li abundance A_{Li} = 2.64, which agrees well with

violated on microscopic scales, for example through the presence of an infinite
series of higher derivatives in the fundamental equations of motion. This type
of nonlocality leads to improved UV behaviour, novel cosmological dynamics and
is a generic prediction of string theory. On the other hand, fundamentally
nonlocal models are fraught with complications, including instabilities and
complications in setting up the initial value problem. We study the structure
of the initial value problem in an interesting class of nonlocal models. We
advocate a novel new formulation wherein the Cauchy surface is ""smeared out""
over the underlying scale of nonlocality, so that the the usual notion of
initial data at t=0 is replaced with an ""initial function"" defined over -M^{-1}
\leq t \leq 0 where M is the underlying scale of nonlocality. Focusing on some
specific examples from string theory and cosmology, we show that this
mathematical re-formulation has surprising implications for the well-known
stability problem. For D-brane decay in a linear dilaton background, we are
able to show that the unstable directions in phase space cannot be accessed
starting from a physically sensible initial function. Previous examples of
unstable solutions in this model therefore correspond to unphysical initial
conditions, an observation which is obfuscated in the old formulation of the
initial value problem. We also discuss implication of this approach for
nonlocal cosmological models.

of ~3030 rad/m**2 has been estimated for the brightest component which
contributes almost all of the polarised emission. Further, two more extended

emission and a curved jet embedded in more diffuse emission. It exhibits
complex field directions near the emission peaks, which indicate rest-frame RM
values in excess of ~6000 rad/m**2. The locations of the cores in 3C318 and
3C343 are not clear. The available data on mas-scale rest-frame RM estimates
for CSS sources show that these have a wide range of values extending up to
~40000 rad/m**2 in the central region of OQ172, and could be located at
projected distances from the core of up to ~1600 pc, as in 3C43 where this
feature has a rest-frame RM of ~14000 rad/m**2. RM estimates for cores in
core-dominated radio sources indicate that in addition to responding to an
overall density gradient of the magneto-ionic medium, geometry, orientation and
modes of fuelling may also play a significant role. In addition to these
effects, the high values of RM in CSS sources are possibly due to dense clouds
of gas interacting with the radio jets. The observed distortions in the radio

the red supergiant VY CMa truly is a spectacular object. Because of its extreme
evolutionary state, it could explode as supernova any time. Studying its
circumstellar material, into which the supernova blast will run, provides
interesting constraints on supernova explosions and on the rich chemistry
taking place in such complex circumstellar envelopes. We have obtained
spectroscopy of VYCMa over the full wavelength range offered by the PACS and
SPIRE instruments of Herschel, i.e. 55 to 672 micron. The observations show the
spectral fingerprints of more than 900 spectral lines, of which more than half
belong to water. In total, we have identified 13 different molecules and some
of their isotopologues. A first analysis shows that water is abundantly
present, with an ortho-to-para ratio as low as 1.3:1, and that chemical
non-equilibrium processes determine the abundance fractions in the inner
envelope.

generating functions for certain combinatorial objects (graphs with additional
data). In this article we discuss a general approach to all such cases using
colored graphs. We prove that the generating power series for such graphs
satisfy the same system of partial differential equations as the Gaussian
integral and the formal power series solution of this system is unique. The
solution is obtained as the genus expansion of the generating power series. The
initial term of this expansion is the corresponding generating function for
trees. The consequence equations for this term turns to be equivalent to the
inversion problem for the gradient mapping defined by the initial condition.
The equations for the higher terms of the genus expansion are linear. The
solutions of these equations can be expressed explicitly by substitution of the
initial conditions and the initial term (the tree expansion) into some
universal polynomials (for g>1) which are generating functions for stable
closed graphs. (For g=1 instead of polynomials appears logarithm.) The stable
graph polynomials satisfy certain recurrence. In [1] some of these results were
obtained for the one dimensional case by more or less direct solution of
differential equations. Here we present purely combinatorial proofs.

analysis of the stellar continuum finding a young stellar population (<100Myr)
or a featureless continuum embedded in an old stellar population (10Gyr)
typical for a massive elliptical galaxy. The stellar velocity dispersion of
sigma_*=320\pm90 km/s and the estimated black hole mass
log(M_BH/M_sun)=8.7\pm0.3 are consistent with the local M_BH-sigma_* relation
within the errors. For the first time we map the two-dimensional ionised gas
distribution and the gas velocity field around HE 1029-1401. While the stellar
host morphology is purely elliptical we find a highly structured distribution
of ionised gas out to 16 kpc from the QSO. The gas is highly ionised solely by
the QSO radiation and has a significantly lower metallicity than would be
expected for the stellar mass of the host, indicating an external origin of the
gas most likely due to minor mergers. We find a rotating gas disc around the
QSO and a dispersion-dominated non-rotating gas component within the central 3
kpc. At larger distances the velocity field is heavily disturbed, which could
be interpreted as another signature of past minor merger events. Alternatively,
the arc-like structure seen in the ionised gas might also be indicative of a
large-scale expanding bubble, centred on and possibly driven by the active
nucleus.

Mm apparent wavelength that propagates towards the sunspot. This wave seems to
trigger oscillations inside the sunspot's umbra, which originate from a
location inside the penumbra on the side of the impinging wave. The wavelength
decreases and the velocity amplitude increases by an order of magnitude in the
chromospheric layers inside the sunspot. On the side of the sunspot opposite to
the impinging plane wave, circular wave fronts centered on the umbra are seen
propagating away from the sunspot outside its outer white-light boundary. They
lead to a peculiar ring structure around the sunspot, which is visible in both
velocity and intensity maps. The fact that only weak photospheric velocity
oscillations are seen in the umbra - contrary to the chromosphere where they
peak there - highlights the necessity to include the upper solar atmosphere in
calculations of wave propagation through spatially and vertically extended
magnetic field concentrations like sunspots.

periodic double arrays of subwavelength dielectric cylinders in TM
polarization. They are similar to localized waveguide mode solutions of
Maxwell's equations for metal cavities or defects of photonic crystals, but, in
contrast to the latter, their spectrum lies in the radiation continuum. The
phenomenon is identical to the existence of bound sates in the radiation
continuum in quantum mechanics, discovered by von Neumann and Wigner. In the
formal scattering theory, these states appear as resonances with the vanishing
width. For the system studied, the bound states are shown to exist at specific
distances between the arrays in the spectral region where one or two
diffraction channels are open. Analytic solutions are obtained for all bound
states (below the radiation continuum and in it) in the limit of thin cylinders
(the cylinder radius is much smaller than the wavelength). The existence of
bound states is also established in the spectral region where three and more
diffraction channels are open, provided the cylinders' dielectric constant and
radius are fine-tuned. The near field and scattering resonances of the
structure are investigated when the distance between the arrays varies in the
neighborhood of its critical values at which the bound states are formed. In
particular, it is shown that the near field in the scattering process becomes
significantly amplified in specific regions of the array as the distance
approaches its critical values. The effect may be used to control optical
non-linear effects by varying the distance between the arrays near its critical
values.
