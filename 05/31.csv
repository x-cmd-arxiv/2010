from the nonlinear relaxation dynamics in the succession of the Rosensweig
instability. A flat layer of a ferrofluid is cooled such that the liquid has a
relatively high viscosity. Consequently, the dynamics of the formation of the
Rosensweig pattern becomes very slow. By sudden switching of the magnetic
induction, the system is pushed to an arbitrary point in the phase space
spanned by the pattern amplitude and the magnetic induction. Afterwards, it is
allowed to relax to its equilibrium point. From the dynamics of this
relaxation, we reconstruct the underlying fully nonlinear equation of motion of
the pattern amplitude. The measured nonlinear dynamics serves to select the
best weakly nonlinear expansion which describes this hysteretic transition.

focused on early and mid M dwarfs. The present paper examines 11 fully
convective late M dwarfs (spectral types M5-M8). Tomographic imaging techniques
were applied to time-series of circularly polarised profiles of 6 stars, in
order to infer their large-scale magnetic topologies. For 3 other stars we
could not produce such magnetic maps, because of low variability of the Stokes
V signatures, but were able to derive some properties of the magnetic fields.
We find 2 distinct categories of magnetic topologies: on the one hand strong
axisymmetric dipolar fields (similar to mid M dwarfs), and on the other hand
weak fields generally featuring a significant non-axisymmetric component, and
sometimes a significant toroidal one. Comparison with unsigned magnetic fluxes
demonstrates that the second category of magnetic fields shows less
organization (less energy in the large scales), similarly to partly convective
early M dwarfs. Stars in both categories have similar stellar parameters, our
data do not evidence a separation between these 2 categories in the
mass-rotation plane. We also report marginal detection of a large-scale
magnetic field on the M8 star VB 10 featuring a significant toroidal

concept for high-precision radial velocity (RV) surveys for extrasolar planets.
A combination of Michelson interferometer and medium-resolution spectrograph,
it has the potential for performing multi-object surveys, where most previous
RV techniques have been limited to observing only one target at a time. Because
of the large sample of extrasolar planets needed to better understand planetary
formation, evolution, and prevalence, this new technique represents a logical
next step in instrumentation for RV extrasolar planet searches, and has been
proven with the single-object Exoplanet Tracker (ET) at Kitt Peak National
Observatory, and the multi-object W. M. Keck/MARVELS Exoplanet Tracker at
Apache Point Observatory. The development of the ET instruments has
necessitated fleshing out a detailed understanding of the physical principles
of the DFDI technique. Here we summarize the fundamental theoretical material
needed to understand the technique and provide an overview of the physics
underlying the instrument's working. We also derive some useful analytical
formulae that can be used to estimate the level of various sources of error
generic to the technique, such as photon shot noise when using a fiducial
reference spectrum, contamination by secondary spectra (e.g., crowded sources,
spectroscopic binaries, or moonlight contamination), residual interferometer
comb, and reference cross-talk error. Following this, we show that the use of a
traditional gas absorption fiducial reference with a DFDI can incur significant
systematic errors that must be taken into account at the precision levels

have been widely studied, we find that there is a large number of additional
steady-state patterns which exhibit stable defects. The defect density can be
so high that the pattern is completely disordered, and that the distinction
between lamellar and rod patterns is blurred. As a consequence, the transition
from lamellae to rods is not sharp, but extends over a finite range of

anisotropy observed in the WMAP5 data. The local skeleton is traced on the 2D
sphere by cubic spline interpolation which leads to more accurate estimation of
the intersection positions between the skeleton and the secondary pixels than
conventional linear interpolation. We demonstrate that the skeleton-based
estimator of non-Gaussianity of the local type (f_NL) - the departure of the
length distribution from the corresponding Gaussian expectation - yields an
unbiased and sufficiently converged f_NL-likelihood.
  We analyse the skeleton statistics in the WMAP5 combined V- and W-band data
outside the Galactic base-mask determined from the KQ75 sky-coverage. The
results are consistent with Gaussian simulations of the the best-fitting
cosmological model, but deviate from the previous results determined using the
WMAP1 data. We show that it is unlikely that the improved skeleton tracing
method, the omission of Q-band data, the modification of the
foreground-template fitting method or the absence of 6 extended regions in the
new mask contribute to such a deviation. However, the application of the Kp0
base-mask in data processing does improve the consistency with the WMAP1
results.
  The f_NL-likelihoods of the data are estimated at 9 different smoothing
levels. It is unexpected that the best-fit values show positive correlation
with the smoothing scales. Further investigation argues against a point-source
or goodness-of-fit explanation but finds that about 30% of either Gaussian or
f_NL samples having better goodness-of-fit than the WMAP5 show a similar
correlation. We present the estimate f_NL=47.3+/-34.9 (1sigma error) determined
from the first four smoothing angles and f_NL=76.8+/-43.1 for the combination
of all nine. The former result may be overestimated at the 0.21sigma-level

attention in statistical physics, probability theory and theoretical computer
science. It is the probability distribution over independent sets $I$ of a
graph weighted proportionally to $\lambda^{|I|}$ with fugacity parameter
$\lambda$. We prove that at the uniqueness threshold of the hardcore model on
the $d$-regular tree, approximating the partition function becomes
computationally hard on graphs of maximum degree $d$.
  Specifically, we show that unless NP$=$RP there is no polynomial time
approximation scheme for the partition function (the sum of such weighted
independent sets) on graphs of maximum degree $d$ for fugacity $\lambda_c(d) <
\lambda < \lambda_c(d) + \epsilon(d)$ where $\lambda_c =
\frac{(d-1)^{d-1}}{(d-2)^d}$ is the uniqueness threshold on the $d$-regular
tree and $\epsilon(d)>0$. Weitz produced an FPTAS for approximating the
partition function when $0<\lambda < \lambda_c(d)$ so this result demonstrates
that the computational threshold exactly coincides with the statistical physics
phase transition thus confirming the main conjecture of [28]. We further
analyze the special case of $\lambda=1, d=6$ and show there is no polynomial
time algorithm for approximately counting independent sets on graphs of maximum
degree $d= 6$ which is optimal.
  Our proof is based on specially constructed random bi-partite graphs which
act as gadgets in a reduction to MAX-CUT. Building on the second moment method
analysis of [28] and combined with an analysis of the reconstruction problem on
the tree our proof establishes a strong version of 'replica' method heuristics
developed by theoretical physicists. The result establishes the first rigorous

flat FLRW cosmological models, in which the vacuum energy density evolves with

perturbations, as they decouple from the background expansion, ""turn around""
and finally collapse. We generalize the spherical collapse model in the case
when the vacuum energy is a running function of the Hubble rate,
$\Lambda=\Lambda(H)$. A particularly well motivated model of this type is the
so-called quantum field vacuum, in which $\Lambda(H)$ is a quadratic function,
$\Lambda(H)=n_0+n_2\,H^2$, with $n_0\neq 0$. This model was previously studied
by our team using the latest high quality cosmological data to constrain its
free parameters, as well as the predicted cluster formation rate. It turns out
that the corresponding Hubble expansion history resembles that of the
traditional $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We use this $\Lambda(t)$CDM framework to
illustrate the fact that the properties of the spherical collapse model (virial
density, collapse factor, etc.) depend on the choice of the considered vacuum
energy (homogeneous or clustered). In particular, if the distribution of the
vacuum energy is clustered, then, under specific conditions, we can produce
more concentrated structures with respect to the homogeneous vacuum energy
case.

arbitrary but known class $\mathcal C$ of process measures. The non-realizable
case is when $\mu$ is completely arbitrary, but the prediction performance is
measured with respect to a given set $\mathcal C$ of process measures. We are
interested in the relations between these problems and between their solutions,
as well as in characterizing the cases when a solution exists and finding these
solutions. We show that if the quality of prediction is measured using the
total variation distance, then these problems coincide, while if it is measured
using the expected average KL divergence, then they are different. For some of
the formalizations we also show that when a solution exists, it can be obtained
as a Bayes mixture over a countable subset of $\mathcal C$. We also obtain
several characterization of those sets $\mathcal C$ for which solutions to the
considered problems exist. As an illustration to the general results obtained,
we show that a solution to the non-realizable case of the sequence prediction

processes measures considered are not required to be i.i.d., mixing,
stationary, or to belong to any parametric family.

exploit the structure of the system and the height of the sparse (or toric)
resultant by means of mixed volume, as well as recent advances on aggregate
root bounds for univariate polynomials, and are applicable to arbitrary

\cite{c-crmp-87} by a factor of $\OO(d^{n-1})$, where $d$ bounds the degree of
the polynomials, and $n$ is the number of variables. One application is to the
bitsize of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of an integer matrix, which also
yields a new proof that the problem is polynomial. We also compare against
recent lower bounds on the absolute value of the root coordinates by Brownawell

0-dimensional projection. Our bounds are in general comparable, but exploit
sparseness; they are also tighter when bounding the value of a positive

requires Josephson qubits with long coherence times combined to a high-delity

using circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) architectures, where the qubit is
embedded in a coplanar waveguide resonator (CPWR) which both provides a well
controlled electromagnetic environment and serves as qubit readout. In
particular a new qubit design, the transmon, yields reproducibly long coherence
times. However, a high-delity single-shot readout of the transmon, highly
desirable for running simple quantum algorithms or measuring quantum
correlations in multi-qubit experiments, is still lacking. In this work, we
demonstrate a new transmon circuit where the CPWR is turned into a
sample-and-hold detector, namely a Josephson Bifurcation Amplifer (JBA), which
allows both fast measurement and single-shot discrimination of the qubit

initially launched below the transition region within the solar atmosphere. The

numerically to find spatial and temporal dynamics of spicules. The numerical
simulations show that the strong initial pulse may lead to the quasi periodic
rising of chromospheric material into the lower corona in the form of spicules.
The periodicity results from the nonlinear wake that is formed behind the pulse
in the stratified atmosphere. The superposition of raising and falling off
plasma portions resembles the time sequence of single and double (sometimes
even triple) spicules, which is consistent with observational findings. The
two-dimensional rebound shock model may explain the observed speed, width, and
heights of type I spicules, as well as observed multi-structural and
bi-directional flows. The model also predicts the appearance of spicules with
3-5 min period due to the consecutive shocks.

the concepts and tools of phylogenetic systematics (cladistics) can be
heuristically transposed to the case of galaxies. This approach that we call
""astrocladistics"", has now successfully been applied on several samples of
galaxies and globular clusters. Maximum parsimony and distance-based approaches
are the most popular methods to produce phylogenetic trees and, like most other
studies, we had to discretize our variables. However, since astrophysical data
are intrinsically continuous, we are contributing to the growing need for
applying phylogenetic methods to continuous characters.

edge weights are drawn from a Gaussian distribution. For a given realization of

sophisticated polynomial-time matching algorithms. We characterize the loops
via observables similar to those used in percolation studies and perform
finite-size scaling analyses, up to side length L=256 in 2d, L=48 in 3d and
L=20 in 4d (for which we study only some observables), in order to estimate
geometric exponents that characterize the configurations of densely and fully

random walks from dimension d=3 on, in contrast to the previously studied
behavior at the percolation threshold, where random-walk behavior is obtained
for d>=6.

found to our detection limits in any of the four galaxies. We find that the
13CO/12CO ratios of three SAURON galaxies are somewhat higher than those in
galaxies of different Hubble types. The HCN/12CO and HCN/13CO ratios of all
four SAURON galaxies resemble those of nearby Seyfert and dwarf galaxies with
normal star formation rates, rather than those of starburst galaxies. The
HCN/HCO+ ratio is found to be relatively high (i.e., >1) in the three SAURON
galaxies with detected HCN emission, mimicking the behaviour in other
star-forming galaxies but being higher than in starburst galaxies. When
compared to most galaxies, it thus appears that 13CO is enhanced (relative to
12CO) in three out of four SAURON galaxies and HCO+ is weak (relative to HCN)
in three out of three galaxies.
  All three galaxies detected in HCN follow the standard HCN-infrared

already suggested by 12CO observations, when traced by infrared radiation, star
formation in the three SAURON galaxies thus appears to follow the same physical

three-parameter correlation discovered more than twenty years ago. It has
resisted a both global and precise physical interpretation despite a consequent
number of works, observational, theoretical or using numerical simulations. It
appears that its precise properties depend on the population of galaxies in
study. Instead of selecting a priori these populations, we propose to
objectively construct homologous populations from multivariate analyses. We
have undertaken multivariate cluster and cladistic analyses of a sample of 56
low-redshift galaxy clusters containing 699 early-type galaxies, using four
parameters: effective radius, velocity dispersion, surface brightness averaged
over effective radius, and Mg2 index. All our analyses are consistent with
seven groups that define separate regions on the global fundamental plane, not
across its thickness. In fact, each group shows its own fundamental plane,
which is more loosely defined for less diversified groups. We conclude that the
global fundamental plane is not a bent surface, but made of a collection of
several groups characterizing several fundamental planes with different
thicknesses and orientations in the parameter space. Our diversification
scenario probably indicates that the level of diversity is linked to the number
and the nature of transforming events and that the fundamental plane is the
result of several transforming events. We also show that our classification,
not the fundamental planes, is universal within our redshift range (0.007 -
0.053). We find that the three groups with the thinnest fundamental planes
presumably formed through dissipative (wet) mergers. In one of them, this(ese)
merger(s) must have been quite ancient because of the relatively low
metallicity of its galaxies, Two of these groups have subsequently undergone
dry mergers to increase their masses. In the k-space, the third one clearly
occupies the region where bulges (of lenticular or spiral galaxies) lie and
might also have formed through minor mergers and accretions. The two least
diversified groups probably did not form by major mergers and must have been
strongly affected by interactions, some of the gas in the objects of one of
these groups having possibly been swept out. The interpretation, based on
specific assembly histories of galaxies of our seven groups, shows that they
are truly homologous. They were obtained directly from several observables,
thus independently of any a priori classification. The diversification scenario
relating these groups does not depend on models or numerical simulations, but
is objectively provided by the cladistic analysis. Consequently, our
classification is more easily compared to models and numerical simulations, and
our work can be readily repeated with additional observables.

derivative $O(p^{2})$ term as found in recent analysis of the $\eta
-\eta^{\prime}$ system. This term gives rise to an additional
momentum-dependent pole contribution which is suppressed by a factor
$m_{\eta}^{2}/m_{\eta^{\prime}}^{2}$ for $\eta$ relative to the $\eta^{\prime}$
amplitude. The processes with $\eta$ meson can then be described, to a good
approximation, by the momentum-independent mixing mass term which gives rise to
a new $\eta -\eta^{\prime}$ mixing angle $\theta_{P}$, like the old $\eta
-\eta^{\prime}$ mixing angle used in the past, but a momentum-dependent mixing
term $d$, like $\sin(\theta_{0}-\theta_{8})$ in the two-angle mixing scheme
used in the parametrization of the pseudo-scalar meson decay constants in the
current literature, is needed to describe the amplitudes with $\eta^{\prime}$.
In this paper, we obtain sum rules relating $\theta_{P}$ and $d$ to the
physical vector meson radiative decays with $\eta$ and $\eta^{\prime}$, as done
in our previous work for $\eta$ meson two-photon decay, and with nonet symmetry
for the $\eta^{\prime}$ amplitude, we obtain a mixing angle
$\theta_{P}=-(18.76\pm 3.4)^{\circ}$, $d=0.10\pm 0.03$ from $\rho\to\eta\gamma$
and $\eta^{\prime}\to\rho\gamma$ decays, for $\omega$, $\theta_{P}=-(15.81\pm
3.1)^{\circ}$, $d=0.02\pm 0.03$, and for $\phi$, $\theta_{P}=-(13.83\pm
2.1)^{\circ}$, $d=0.08\pm 0.03$. A larger value of $0.06\pm 0.02$ for $d$ is
obtained directly from the nonet symmetry expression for the
$\eta^{\prime}\to\omega\gamma$ amplitude. This indicates that more precise
vector meson radiative decay measured branching ratios and higher order SU(3)
breaking effects could bring these values for $\theta_{P}$ closer and allows a
better determination of $d$.

the pi- and eta-mesons. Also decays of charged hadrons can be studied. For
charged hadrons the one-photon-exchange amplitude comes with a Coulomb-phase
factor and a Coulomb-form factor, which depend on the ratio between transverse-
and logitudinal-momentum transfers, the latter being fixed. At the peak of the
cross-section distribution, where the two momentum transfers are equal, the
form factor could cut down the cross-section value by as much as 40 %.

Spectrometer (PACS), on board the Herschel satellite as part of the PACS
evolutionary probe (PEP) guaranteed project along with submm ground-based
observations to measure the dust mass of a sample of high-z submillimeter
galaxies (SMGs). We investigate their dust content relative to their stellar
and gas masses, and compare them with local star-forming galaxies. High-z SMGs
are dust rich, i.e. they have higher dust-to-stellar mass ratios compared to
local spiral galaxies (by a factor of 30) and also compared to local
ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs, by a factor of 6). This indicates that
the large masses of gas typically hosted in SMGs have already been highly
enriched with metals and dust. Indeed, for those SMGs whose gas mass is
measured, we infer dust-to-gas ratios similar or higher than local spirals and
ULIRGs. However, similarly to other strongly star-forming galaxies in the local
Universe and at high-z, SMGs are characterized by gas metalicities lower (by a
factor of a few) than local spirals, as inferred from their optical nebular
lines, which are generally ascribed to infall of metal-poor gas. This is in
contrast with the large dust content inferred from the far-IR and submm data.
In short, the metalicity inferred from the dust mass is much higher (by more
than an order of magnitude) than that inferred from the optical nebular lines.
We discuss the possible explanations of this discrepancy and the possible
implications for the investigation of the metalicity evolution at high-z.

allow an estimation of the threshold region separating the low-SNR and high-SNR
regimes, and they indicate the asymptotic behavior of the BB at high SNR. We
also develop numerical lower and upper bounds which are tighter than the
closed-form bounds and thus characterize the BB more accurately. Numerical
studies compare our characterization of the BB with established biased
estimation schemes, and demonstrate that while unbiased estimators perform
poorly at low SNR, they may perform better than biased estimators at high SNR.
An interesting conclusion of our analysis is that the high-SNR behavior of the
BB depends solely on the value of the smallest nonzero component of the sparse
vector, and that this type of dependence is also exhibited by the performance
of certain practical estimators.

$T<10^{4}$ K for ages $t>10^{7}$ yr. However, the likely thermal emission
detected from the millisecond pulsar J0437-4715, of spin-down age $t_s \sim
7\times10^9$ yr, implies a temperature $T\sim 10^5$ K. Thus, a heating
mechanism needs to be added to the cooling models in order to obtain agreement
between theory and observation. Aims: Several internal heating mechanisms could
be operating in neutron stars, such as magnetic field decay, dark matter
accretion, crust cracking, superfluid vortex creep, and non-equilibrium
reactions (""rotochemical heating""). We study these mechanisms in order to
establish which could be the dominant source of thermal emission from old
pulsars. Methods: We show by simple estimates that magnetic field decay, dark
matter accretion, and crust cracking mechanism are unlikely to have a
significant effect on old neutron stars. The thermal evolution for the other
mechanisms is computed using the code of Fern\'andez and Reisenegger. Given the
dependence of the heating mechanisms on the spin-down parameters, we study the
thermal evolution for two types of pulsars: young, slowly rotating ""classical""
pulsars and old, fast rotating millisecond pulsars. Results: We find that
magnetic field decay, dark matter accretion, and crust cracking do not produce
detectable heating of old pulsars. Rotochemical heating and vortex creep can be
important both for classical pulsars and millisecond pulsars. More restrictive
upper limits on the surface temperatures of classical pulsars could rule out
vortex creep as the main source of thermal emission. Rotochemical heating in
classical pulsars is driven by the chemical imbalance built up during their
early spin-down, and therefore strongly sensitive to their initial rotation
period.

concentrations, we determine by direct numerical simulations the turbulence
contributions to the mean magnetic pressure in a strongly stratified isothermal
layer with large plasma beta, where a weak uniform horizontal mean magnetic
field is applied. The negative contribution of turbulence to the effective mean
magnetic pressure is determined for strongly stratified forced turbulence over
a range of values of magnetic Reynolds and Prandtl numbers. Small-scale dynamo
action is shown to reduce the negative effect of turbulence on the effective
mean magnetic pressure. However, the turbulence coefficients describing the
negative effective magnetic pressure phenomenon are found to be converged for
magnetic Reynolds numbers between 60 and 600, which is the largest value
considered here. In all these models the turbulent intensity is arranged to be
nearly independent of height, so the kinetic energy density decreases with
height due to the decrease in density. In a second series of numerical
experiments, the turbulent intensity increases with height such that the
turbulent kinetic energy density is nearly independent of height. Turbulent
magnetic diffusivity and turbulent pumping velocity are determined with the
test-field method for both cases. The vertical profile of the turbulent
magnetic diffusivity is found to agree with what is expected based on simple
mixing length expressions. Turbulent pumping is shown to be down the gradient
of turbulent magnetic diffusivity, but it is twice as large as expected.
Corresponding numerical mean-field models are used to show that a large-scale
instability can occur in both cases, provided the degree of scale separation is
large enough and hence the turbulent magnetic diffusivity small enough.

which argues that the correlation that holds is with a momentum-like parameter,
although this feedback mechanism is based on energy balance.
