renewal times come from a one parameter family of probability laws and the
sequence of the parameters is the trajectory of an ergodic Markov chain. Our
primary interest here is the asymptotic distribution of the Markovian parameter
at time t \to \infty. The limit, of course, depends on the stationary
distribution of the Markov chain. The results, however, are essentially
different depending on whether the expectations of the renewals are finite or
infinite. If the expectations are uniformly bounded, then we can provide the
limit in general (beyond the class of scaled type processes), where the
expectations of the probability laws in question appear, too. If the means are
infinite, then - by assuming that the renewal times are rescaled versions of a
regularly varying probability law with exponent 0 \leq alpha \leq 1 - it is the
exponent a which emerges in the limits.

presented his quantum theory of the ideal gas of 1924-1925. Although it failed

very few commentators refer to it, we argue for its significance in the context
of Einstein's quantum researches. It contains an attempt to extend and exhaust
the characterization of the monatomic ideal gas without appealing to
combinatorics. Its ambiguities illustrate Einstein's confusion with his initial
success in extending Bose's results and in realizing the consequences of what
later became to be called Bose-Einstein statistics. We discuss Einstein's
motivation for writing a non-combinatorial paper, partly in response to
criticism by his friend Ehrenfest, and we paraphrase its content. Its arguments
are based on Einstein's belief in the complete analogy between the
thermodynamics of light quanta and of material particles and invoke
considerations of adiabatic transformations as well as of dimensional analysis.
These techniques were well-known to Einstein from earlier work on Wien's
displacement law, Planck's radiation theory, and the specific heat of solids.
We also investigate the possible role of Ehrenfest in the gestation of the
theory.

of coronal null points: locations where the magnetic field, and hence the local
Alfven speed, is zero. The behaviour of all three MHD wave modes, i.e. the
Alfven wave and the fast and slow magnetoacoustic waves, has been investigated
in the neighbourhood of 2D, 2.5D and (to a certain extent) 3D magnetic null
points, for a variety of assumptions, configurations and geometries. In
general, it is found that the fast magnetoacoustic wave behaviour is dictated
by the Alfven-speed profile. In a $\beta=0$ plasma, the fast wave is focused
towards the null point by a refraction effect and all the wave energy, and thus
current density, accumulates close to the null point. Thus, null points will be
locations for preferential heating by fast waves. Independently, the Alfven
wave is found to propagate along magnetic fieldlines and is confined to the
fieldlines it is generated on. As the wave approaches the null point, it
spreads out due to the diverging fieldlines. Eventually, the Alfven wave
accumulates along the separatrices (in 2D) or along the spine or fan-plane (in
3D). Hence, Alfven wave energy will be preferentially dissipated at these
locations. It is clear that the magnetic field plays a fundamental role in the
propagation and properties of MHD waves in the neighbourhood of coronal null
points. This topic is a fundamental plasma process and results so far have also
lead to critical insights into reconnection, mode-coupling, quasi-periodic
pulsations and phase-mixing.

computation to enhance data fusion efficiency, and determine the minimum
worst-case total number of bits to be exchanged to perform the desired
computation. We establish lower bounds using fooling sets, and provide a novel
scheme which attains the lower bounds, using information theoretic tools. For a
class of functions called sum-threshold functions, this scheme is shown to be
optimal. We then turn to tree networks and derive a lower bound for the number
of bits exchanged on each link by viewing it as a two node problem. We show
that the protocol of recursive innetwork aggregation achieves this lower bound
in the case of sumthreshold functions. Thus we have provided a communication
and in-network computation strategy that is optimal for each link. All the
results can be extended to the case of non-binary alphabets. In the case of
general graphs, we present a cut-set lower bound, and an achievable scheme
based on aggregation along trees. For complete graphs, the complexity of this

threshold functions. The optimal ordering is dynamic, i.e., it could
potentially depend on the values of previously transmitted bits. Further, it
depends only on the ordering of the marginal probabilites, but not on their

2007. The CMS Tracker sub-detector, comprises ~10 million detector channels
read out by ~40 000 analog optical links. The optoelectronic components have
been designed to meet the stringent requirements of a HEP experiment in terms
of radiation hardness, low mass and low power. Extensive testing has been
performed on the components and on complete optical links in test systems.
Their functionality and performance in terms of gain, noise, linearity,
bandwidth and radiation hardness is detailed. Particular emphasis is placed on
the gain, which directly affects the dynamic range of the detector data. It has
been possible to accurately predict the variation in gain that will be observed
throughout the system. A simulation based on production test data showed that
the average gain would be ~38% higher than the design target at the Tracker
operating temperature of -10{\deg}C. Corrective action was taken to reduce the
gains and recover the lost dynamic range by lowering the optical receiver's
load resistor value from 100{\Omega} to 62{\Omega}. All links will have gains
between 0.64 and 0.96V/V. The future iteration of CMS will be operated in an
upgraded LHC requiring faster data readout. In order to preserve the large
investments made for the current readout system, an upgrade path that involves
reusing the existing optoelectronic components is considered. The applicability
of Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) in a HEP readout system is examined.
The method for calculating the data rate is presented, along with laboratory
tests where QAM signals were transmitted over a Tracker optical link. The
results show that 3-4Gbit/s would be possible if such a design can be
implemented (over 10 times the equivalent data rate of the current analog
links, 320Mbits/s).

how to adjust these parameters in order to achieve the best properties for a

Methods: Using the VLBA and the EVN arrays, we conducted phase-referenced

22.2 GHz (4 epochs), CH3OH at 6.7 GHz (3 epochs), and OH at 1.665 GHz (1

0.1 mJy) VLA observations of the radio continuum emission from the HMC at 1.3
and 3.6 cm. Results: We have detected H2O, CH3OH, and OH maser emission
clustered within 2000 AU from the center of a flattened HMC, oriented SE-NW,
from which emerges a massive 12CO outflow, elongated NE-SW, extended up to the
pc-scale. Although the three maser species show a clearly different spatial and
velocity distribution and sample distinct environments around the massive YSO,
the spatial symmetry and velocity field of each maser specie can be explained
in terms of expansion from a common center, which possibly denotes the position
of the YSO driving the maser motion. Water masers trace both a fast shock (up
to 50 km/s) closer to the YSO, powered by a wide-angle wind, and a slower (20
km/s) bipolar jet, at the base of the large-scale outflow. Since the compact
free-free emission is found offset from the putative location of the YSO along
a direction consistent with that of the maser jet axis, we interpret the radio
continuum in terms of a thermal jet. The velocity field of methanol masers can
be explained in terms of a composition of slow (4 km/s in amplitude) motions of
radial expansion and rotation about an axis approximately parallel to the maser
jet. Finally, the distribution of line of sight velocities of the hydroxyl
masers suggests that they can trace gas less dense (n(H2) < 10^6 cm^-3) and
more distant from the YSO than that traced by the water and methanol masers,
which is expanding toward the observer. (Abridged)

of our recently published new multi-color photometry in a wide field of the
cluster with particular emphasis on the U band. Using the photometric data
corrected for differential reddening, we found for the first time two key signs
of the inhomogeneity in the cluster's stellar population and of its radial
variation in the GC. These are (1) an obvious trend in the color-position
diagram, based on the (U-B) color-index, of red giant branch (RGB) stars, which
shows that the farther from the cluster's center, the bluer on average the
(U-B) color of the stars is; and (2) the dependence of the radial distribution
of sub-giant branch (SGB) stars in the cluster on their U magnitude, where
brighter stars are less centrally concentrated than their fainter counterparts
at a confidence level varying between 99.2% and 99.9% depending on the
color-index used to select the stars. The same effects were recently found by
us in the GC NGC 1261. However, contrary to NGC 1261, we are not able to
unambiguously suggest which of the sub-populations of SGB/RGB stars can be the
progenitor of blue and red horizontal branch stars of the cluster. Apart from
M4, NGC 3201 is another GC very probably with an inhomogeneous stellar
population, which has essentially lower mass than the most massive Galactic GCs
where multiple stellar populations were unambiguously detected for the first
time

complicated link, previously studied in the mathematical literature, and known
as Chain-Mail, can be related directly to known topological invariants of

genome sequencing experiments. In an extension of the classic Lander-Waterman
model, we consider the effect of the length distribution of fragments. We also
introduce the notion of the shape of a coverage function, which can be used to
detect abberations in coverage. The probability theory underlying these
problems is essential for constructing models of current high-throughput
sequencing experiments, where both sample preparation protocols and sequencing
technology particulars can affect fragment length distributions.
  Results: We show that regardless of fragment length distribution and under
the mild assumption that fragment start sites are Poisson distributed, the
fragments produced in a sequencing experiment can be viewed as resulting from a
two-dimensional spatial Poisson process. We then study the jump skeleton of the
the coverage function, and show that the induced trees are Galton-Watson trees
whose parameters can be computed.
  Conclusions: Our results extend standard analyses of shotgun sequencing that
focus on coverage statistics at individual sites, and provide a null model for
detecting deviations from random coverage in high-throughput sequence census
based experiments. By focusing on fragments, we are also led to a new approach
for visualizing sequencing data that should be of independent interest.

facilitating the implementation of equilibrium many-body techniques. We provide
an alternative derivation of the effective Hamiltonian of Hershfield using the

between observables computed using the Schwinger-Keldysh framework and the
effective equilibrium approach. For the study of transport, the non-equilibrium

interest and we derive general expressions for the current (the Meir-Wingreen

first show that the required circular velocity has no dependence on the height

density only. The assumption of disks being very thin enables us to decouple
the vertical structure from the radial direction. Based on that, the equation
of hydrostatic equilibrium together with the reduced Poisson equation leads to
two sets of second-order non-linear differential equation, which are easily
integrated to set-up a stable disk. We call one approach `density method' and
the other one `potential method'. Gas disks in detailed balance are especially
suitable for investigating the onset of the gravitational instability. We
revisit the question of global, axisymmetric instability using fully
three-dimensional disk simulations. The impact of disk thickness on the disk
instability and the formation of spontaneously induced spirals is studied
systematically with or without the presence of the stellar potential. In our
models, the numerical results show that the threshold value for disk
instability is shifted from unity to 0.69 for self-gravitating thick disks and
to 0.75 for combined stellar and gas thick disks. The simulations also show
that self-induced spirals occur in the correct regions and with the right

long-ranged dipolar interactions are maximally repulsive. In the limit of zero
inter-site hopping and sufficiently large on-site interaction, the phase
diagram is a complete devil's staircase for filling fractions between 0 and 1:
every commensurate state at a rational filling is stable over a finite interval
in chemical potential, and for every chemical potential the system is in a
gapped commensurate phase. We perturb away from this limit in two
experimentally motivated directions involving the addition of hopping and a
reduction of the onsite interaction. The addition of hopping alone yields a
phase diagram, which we compute in perturbation theory in the hopping, where
the commensurate Mott phases now compete with the superfluid. We capture the
physics of the Mott-superfluid phase transitions via bosonization. In a finite
trap, we argue using an LDA and simulated annealing that this results in
regions of commensurate states separated by patches with dominant superfluid
correlations. Further softening of the onsite interaction yields alternative
commensurate states with double occupancies which can form a devil's staircase
of their own; we describe these states and discuss the possible transitions
between them. Adding a hopping term in this case produces one-dimensional

superfluidity. The contents of this work was first published as a chapter in

over such sectors, thus leading to the usual theta-vacua. We show that without
changing the local degrees of freedom, a theory can be modified such that the
sum over instantons should be restricted; e.g. one should include only
instanton numbers which are divisible by some integer p. This conclusion about
the configuration space of quantum field theory allows us to carefully
reconsider the quantization of parameters in supergravity. In particular, we
show that FI-terms and nontrivial Kahler forms are quantized. This analysis
also leads to a new derivation of recent results about linearized supergravity.

due to a more general relation between stellar mass M*, gas-phase metallicity
and SFR. Local galaxies define a tight surface in this 3D space, the
Fundamental Metallicity Relation (FMR), with a small residual dispersion of
~0.05 dex in metallicity, i.e, ~12%. At low stellar mass, metallicity decreases
sharply with increasing SFR, while at high stellar mass, metallicity does not
depend on SFR. High redshift galaxies, up to z~2.5 are found to follow the same
FMR defined by local SDSS galaxies, with no indication of evolution. The
evolution of the mass-metallicity relation observed up to z=2.5 is due to the
fact that galaxies with progressively higher SFRs, and therefore lower
metallicities, are selected at increasing redshifts, sampling different parts
of the same FMR. By introducing the new quantity mu_alpha=log(M*)-alpha
log(SFR), with alpha=0.32, we define a projection of the FMR that minimizes the
metallicity scatter of local galaxies. The same quantity also cancels out any
redshift evolution up to z~2.5, i.e, all galaxies have the same range of values
of mu_0.32. At z>2.5, evolution of about 0.6 dex off the FMR is observed, with
high-redshift galaxies showing lower metallicities. The existence of the FMR
can be explained by the interplay of infall of pristine gas and outflow of
enriched material. The former effect is responsible for the dependence of
metallicity with SFR and is the dominant effect at high-redshift, while the
latter introduces the dependence on stellar mass and dominates at low redshift.
The combination of these two effects, together with the Schmidt-Kennicutt law,
explains the shape of the FMR and the role of mu_0.32. The small metallicity
scatter around the FMR supports the smooth infall scenario of gas accretion in
the local universe.

its photometric properties and characteristics, in the rarely studied southern
Galactic globular cluster NGC 1261. We focus on the brighter sequences of the
cluster's color-magnitude diagram (CMD). Like in our previous works, we rely
upon photometry in several passbands to achieve more reliable results and
conclusions. We carried out and analyzed new multi-color photometry of NGC 1261
in UBVI reaching below the turnoff point in all passbands in a fairly extended
cluster field, about 14'x14'. We found several signs of the inhomogeneity
(""multiplicity"") in the stellar population. The most prominent of them are: (1)
the dependence of the radial distribution of sub-giant branch (SGB) stars in
the cluster on their U magnitude, with brighter stars less centrally
concentrated at the 99.9 \% level than their fainter counterparts; (2) the
dependence of the location of red giant branch (RGB) stars in the U-(U-B) CMD
on their radial distance from the cluster center, with the portion of stars
bluer in the (U-B) color increasing towards the cluster outskirts.
Additionally, the radial variation of the RGB luminosity function in the bump
region is suspected. We assume that both the SGB stars brighter in the U and
the RGB stars bluer in the (U-B) color are probably associated with blue
horizontal branch stars, because of a similarity in their radial distribution
in the cluster. We estimated the metalicity of NGC 1261 from the slope of the
RGB in U-based CMDs and the location of the RGB bump on the branch. These
metallicity indicators give [Fe/H]zw = -1.34 +/- 0.16 dex and [Fe/H]zw = -1.41
+/- 0.10 dex, respectively. We isolated 18 probable blue straggler candidates.
They are more centrally concentrated than the lower red giants of comparable
brightness at the 97.9 \% level.

the foundation for contemporary population genetics. The Wright-Fisher model

inference that enabled the quantification of genetic drift and selection. Given
the utility of these tools, we often forget that their model - for
mathematical, and not biological reasons - makes assumptions that are violated
in most real-world populations. In this paper, I consider an alternative
framework that merges P. A. P. Moran's continuous-time Markov chain model of
allele frequency with the density dependent models of ecological competition
proposed by Gause, Lotka and Volterra, that, unlike Moran's model allow for a
stochastically varying -- but bounded -- population size. I require that allele
numbers vary according to a density-dependent population process, for which the
limiting law of large numbers is a dissipative, irreducible, competitive
dynamical system. Under the assumption that this limiting system admits a
codimension one submanifold of attractive fixed points -- a condition that
naturally generalises the weak selection regime of classical population
dynamics -- it is shown that for an appropriate rescaling of time, the finite
dimensional distributions of the original process converge to those of a
diffusion process on the submanifold. Weak convergence results are also
obtained for a related process.

Fundamental Plane space defined by velocity dispersion (sigma), effective
radius (R_e), and effective surface brightness. We consider contributions to
Mdyn/L variation due to stellar population effects, IMF variations, and
variations in the dark matter fraction within one R_e. Along the FP, we find
that the stellar population contribution scales as M*/L ~ f(sigma), while the
dark matter and/or IMF contribution scales as Mdyn/M* ~ g(Mdyn). The two
contributions to the tilt of the FP rotate the plane around different axes in
the 3D space, with dark matter/IMF variations likely dominating. Through the
thickness of the FP, we find that Mdyn/L variations must be dominated either by
IMF variations or by real differences in dark matter fraction with R_e. Thus
the finite thickness of the FP is due to variations in the stellar mass surface
density within R_e, not the fading of passive stellar populations. These
structural variations are correlated with galaxy star formation histories such
that galaxies with higher Mdyn/M* at a given sigma have higher [Mg/Fe], lower
metallicities, and older mean stellar ages. It is difficult to explain the
observed correlations by allowing the IMF to vary, suggesting difference in
dark matter fraction dominate. These can be produced by variations in the
""conversion efficiency"" of baryons into stars or by the redistribution of stars
and dark matter through dissipational merging. A model in which some galaxies
experience low conversion efficiencies due to premature truncation of star
formation provides a natural explanation for the observed trends.

500 km/s with respect to the systemic velocity of the host galaxy. A comparison
of imaging and spectral data confirm a strong association between the kinematic
components and the spatial knots, which implies a highly disturbed and complex
active region in this object. Subsequent VLA radio imaging reveals a clear jet
aligned with the emission line gas, confirming that a jet-gas interaction is
the best explanation for emission line region. We use the broadband radio
measurements to examine the impact of the jet on the ISM of the host galaxy,
and find that the energy in the radio lobes can heat a significant fraction of
the gas to the virial temperature. Finally, we discuss tests that may help
future surveys distinguish between jet-driven kinematics and true black-hole
binaries. SDSS J151709.20+335324.7 is a remarkable laboratory for AGN feedback
and warrants deeper follow-up study. In the Appendix, we present
high-resolution radio imaging of a second AGN with double-peaked [O III] lines,
SDSS J112939.78+605742.6, which shows a sub-arcsecond radio jet. If the
double-peaked nature of the narrow lines in radio-loud AGN are generally due to
radio jet interactions, we suggest that extended radio structure should be
expected in most of such systems.

tunneling rate from a laterally confined, few-channel external lead into the
lowest orbital state of a spin-orbit coupled quantum dot. We find two
mechanisms leading to a spin-dependent tunneling rate. The first originates
from different electronic $g$-factors in the lead and in the dot, and favors
the tunneling into the spin ground (excited) state when the $g$-factor
magnitude is larger (smaller) in the lead. The second is triggered by
spin-orbit interactions via the opening of off-diagonal spin-tunneling
channels. It systematically favors the spin excited state. For physical
parameters corresponding to lateral GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures and the
experimentally reported tunneling rates, both mechanisms lead to a discrepancy
of $\sim$10% in the spin up vs spin down tunneling rates. We conjecture that
the significantly larger discrepancy observed experimentally originates from
the enhancement of the $g$-factor in laterally confined lead.

ground-level neutron monitors, above the background of cosmics rays. Although
the association of GLE events with both solar flares and coronal mass ejections

acceleration site: coronal flare sites or heliospheric CME-associated shocks?
To investigate the first possibility we explore the timing of GLE events with

magnetic topology of flares, the role of extended acceleration, and particle
trapping. We find that 50% (6 out of 12) of recent (non-occulted) GLE events
are accelerated during the impulsive flare phase, while the remaining half are
accelerated significantly later. It appears that the prompt GLE component,
which is observed in virtually all GLE events, is caused by flare-accelerated
particles in the lower corona, while the delayed gradual GLE component can be
produced by both, either by extended acceleration and/or trapping in flare
sites, or by particles accelerated in CME-associated shocks during their
propagation through the heliosphere.

high temperature (high-$T_c$) superconductivity observed in the cuprates
remains elusive to the researchers. In particular, in the so-called
`underdoped' region, the overall behavior of superconductivity deviates
$qualitatively$ from the standard theoretical description pioneered by Bardeen,
Cooper and Schrieffer (BCS). Recently, the importance of phase fluctuation of
the superconducting order parameter has gained significant support from various
experiments. However, the microscopic mechanism responsible for the
surprisingly soft phase remains one of the most important unsolved puzzles.
Here, opposite to the standard BCS starting point, we propose a simple,
solvable low-energy model in the strong coupling limit, which maps the
superconductivity literally into a well-understood physics of superfluid in a
special dilute bosonic system of local pairs of doped holes. In the
prototypical material (La$_{1-\delta}$Sr$_\delta$)$_2$CuO$_4$, without use of
any free parameter, a $d$-wave superconductivity is obtained for doping above
$\sim 5.2\%$, below which unexpected incoherent $p$-wave pairs dominate.
Throughout the whole underdoped region, very soft phases are found to originate
from enormous mass enhancement of the pairs. Furthermore, a striking mass
divergence is predicted that dictates the occurrence of the observed quantum
critical point. Our model produces properties of the superfluid in good
agreement with the experiments, and provides new insights into several current
puzzles. Owing to its simplicity, this model offers a paradigm of great value
in answering the long-standing challenges in underdoped cuprates.

Casimir energies have been plagued with two types of divergences: The total
energy, which may be thought of as some sort of regularization of the
zero-point energy, $\sum\frac12\hbar\omega$, seems manifestly divergent. And
local energy densities, obtained from the vacuum expectation value of the
energy-momentum tensor, $\langle T_{00}\rangle$, typically diverge near
boundaries. The energy of interaction between distinct rigid bodies of whatever
type is finite, corresponding to observable forces and torques between the
bodies, which can be unambiguously calculated. The self-energy of a body is
less well-defined, and suffers divergences which may or may not be removable.
Some examples where a unique total self-stress may be evaluated include the
perfectly conducting spherical shell first considered by Boyer, a perfectly
conducting cylindrical shell, and dilute dielectric balls and cylinders. In
these cases the finite part is unique, yet there are divergent contributions
which may be subsumed in some sort of renormalization of physical parameters.
The divergences that occur in the local energy-momentum tensor near surfaces
are distinct from the divergences in the total energy, which are often
associated with energy located exactly on the surfaces. However, the local
energy-momentum tensor couples to gravity, so what is the significance of
infinite quantities here? For the classic situation of parallel plates there
are indications that the divergences in the local energy density are consistent
with divergences in Einstein's equations; correspondingly, it has been shown
that divergences in the total Casimir energy serve to precisely renormalize the
masses of the plates, in accordance with the equivalence principle.

probed by TIR (about 70 pc in radius); the radial profile of the 70um flux,
normalized by TIR, is constant at all radii (70um ~ 0.45 TIR); the 1-sigma
standard deviation of the 70um fluxes, normalized by TIR, is a lower fraction
of the mean (0.05 to 0.12 out to ~220 pc) than the normalized 8, 24, and 160um
normalized fluxes (0.12 to 0.52); and these results are invariant between the
LMC and SMC. From these results, we argue that 70um is the most suitable IR
band to use as a monochromatic obscured star formation indicator because it
most accurately reproduces the TIR of HII regions in the LMC and SMC and over
large spatial scales. We also explore the general trends of the 8, 24, 70, and
160um bands in the LMC and SMC HII region SEDs, radial surface brightness
profiles, sizes, and normalized (by TIR) radial flux profiles. We derive an
obscured SFR equation that is modified from the literature to use 70um
luminosity, SFR(Mo/yr) = 9.7(0.7)x10^{-44} L(70)(ergs/s), which is applicable
from 10 to 300 pc distance from the center of an HII region.

study the stability and dynamical properties of K(2,2) Rosenau-Hyman (RH)

equation for the compactons involves first, second and third partial
derivatives in the spatial coordinate and we concentrate on four different
fourth-order methods which differ in the possibility of increasing the degree
of accuracy (or not) of one of the spatial derivatives to sixth order. A method
designed to reduce roundoff errors was found to be the most accurate
approximation in stability studies of single solitary waves, even though all

requires the addition of fourth derivatives related to artificial viscosity.
For those problems the different choices lead to different amounts of
""spurious"" radiation and we compare the virtues of the different choices.

superconductors near the classical critical point. In this regime conductivity
is set by the delicate interplay of two competing effects. The first is that
strong electron-electron interactions in the Cooper channel increase the
life-time of fluctuation Cooper pairs and thus enhance conductivity. On the
other hand, quantum pair-breaking effects tend to suppress superconductivity.
An interplay between these processes defines new regime where fluctuation
induced transport becomes more singular. The most singular contributions to the
conductivity stem from the dynamic Aslamazov-Larkin term, and novel
Maki-Thompson and interference corrections. The crossover temperature from
weakly to strongly fluctuating regime is generated self-consistently as the
result of scattering on dynamic variations of the order parameter. We suggest
that the way to probe nonlinear-fluctuations in superconductors is by
magnetoconductivity measurements in the perpendicular field.

supermassive black hole (BH), in the case that the surrounding star cluster is
nonaxisymmetric. There are four major orbit families; one of these, the pyramid
orbits, have the interesting property that they can approach arbitrarily
closely to the BH. We derive the orbit-averaged equations of motion and show
that in the limit of weak triaxiality, the pyramid orbits are integrable: the
motion consists of a two-dimensional libration of the major axis of the orbit
about the short axis of the triaxial figure, with eccentricity varying as a
function of the two orientation angles, and reaching unity at the corners.
Because pyramid orbits occupy the lowest angular momentum regions of phase
space, they compete with collisional loss cone repopulation and with resonant
relaxation in supplying matter to BHs. General relativistic advance of the
periapse dominates the precession for sufficiently eccentric orbits, and we
show that relativity imposes an upper limit to the eccentricity: roughly the
value at which the relativistic precession time is equal to the time for
torques to change the angular momentum. We argue that this upper limit to the
eccentricity should apply also to evolution driven by resonant relaxation, with
potentially important consequences for the rate of extreme-mass-ratio inspirals
in low-luminosity galaxies. In giant galaxies, we show that capture of stars on
pyramid orbits can dominate the feeding of BHs, at least until such a time as
the pyramid orbits are depleted; however this time can be of order a Hubble
time.

transfer ($OT^{n}_{h}$) with security against non-adaptive malicious
adversaries. The framework costs six communication rounds and costs at most
$40n$ public-key operations in computational overhead. Compared with the known
protocols for fully-simulatable oblivious transfer that works in the plain mode
(where there is no trusted common reference string available) and proven to be
secure under standard model (where there is no random oracle available), the
instantiation based on the decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption of the
framework is the most efficient one, no matter seen from communication rounds
or computational overhead.
  Our framework uses three abstract tools, i.e., perfectly binding commitment,
perfectly hiding commitment and our new smooth projective hash. This allows a
simple and intuitive understanding of its security.
  We instantiate the new smooth projective hash under the lattice assumption,
the decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption, the decisional $N$-th residuosity
assumption, the decisional quadratic residuosity assumption. This indeed shows
that the folklore that it is technically difficult to instantiate the
projective hash framework under the lattice assumption is not true. What's
more, by using this lattice-based hash and lattice-based commitment scheme, we
gain a concrete protocol for $OT^{n}_{h}$ which is secure against quantum
algorithms.

universe filled with dust which is described by the Lema\^itre-Tolman-Bondi
(LTB) solution. First, we give an LTB model whose distance-redshift relation
agrees with that of the concordance $\Lambda$CDM model in the whole redshift
domain and which is well approximated by the Einstein-de Sitter universe at and
before decoupling. We determine the decoupling epoch in this LTB universe by
Gamow's criterion and then calculate the positions of acoustic peaks. Thus
obtained results are not consistent with the WMAP data. However, we find that
one can fit the peak positions by appropriately modifying the LTB model,
namely, by allowing the deviation of the distance-redshift relation from that
of the concordance $\Lambda$CDM model at $z>2$ where no observational data are
available at present. Thus there is still a possibility of explaining the
apparent accelerated expansion of the universe by inhomogeneity without
resorting to dark energy if we abandon the Copernican principle. Even if we do

joint-decoding pseudo-codewords (JD-PCWs) that enables evaluation of the
pairwise error probability between codewords and JD-PCWs. This leads naturally
to a provable upper bound on decoder failure probability. If the channel is a
finite-state intersymbol interference channel, then the LP joint decoder also
has the maximum-likelihood (ML) certificate property and all integer valued
solutions are codewords. In this case, the performance loss relative to ML
decoding can be explained completely by fractional valued JD-PCWs.

likely due to X-ray fluorescence irradiated by an external X-ray source. The
irradiating X-rays would be either the past flare of Sagittarius A* or the

For

impose very little demand on computer resources. For other problems, such as
finding that point in the intersection at which the value of a given function

time. A methodology is presented whose aim is to produce automatically for an
iterative algorithm of the first kind a ""superiorized version"" of it that
retains its computational efficiency but nevertheless goes a long way towards
solving an optimization problem. This is possible to do if the original
algorithm is ""perturbation resilient,"" which is shown to be the case for
various projection algorithms for solving the consistent convex feasibility
problem. The superiorized versions of such algorithms use perturbations that
drive the process in the direction of the optimizer of the given function.
After presenting these intuitive ideas in a precise mathematical form, they are
illustrated in image reconstruction from projections for two different

provides anchor physical layer location privacy in anchor-based hybrid sensor
networks. The idea is for anchor nodes to dynamically change their transmission
power following a certain probability distribution, degrading the localization
accuracy at un-trusted nodes while maintaining high localization accuracy at
trusted nodes. Given an average power constraint, our analysis shows that the
discretized exponential distribution is the distribution that maximizes
location uncertainty at the untrusted nodes. Detailed evaluation through
analysis, simulation, and implementation shows that HyberLoc gives trusted
nodes up to 3.5 times better localization accuracy as compared to untrusted
nodes.

allocation design for a delay-optimal OFDMA uplink system with one base
station, $K$ users and $N_F$ independent subbands. Each mobile has an uplink
queue with heterogeneous packet arrivals and delay requirements. We model the
problem as an infinite horizon average reward Markov Decision Problem (MDP)
where the control actions are functions of the instantaneous Channel State
Information (CSI) as well as the joint Queue State Information (QSI). To
address the distributive requirement and the issue of exponential memory
requirement and computational complexity, we approximate the subband allocation
Q-factor by the sum of the per-user subband allocation Q-factor and derive a
distributive online stochastic learning algorithm to estimate the per-user
Q-factor and the Lagrange multipliers (LM) simultaneously and determine the
control actions using an auction mechanism. We show that under the proposed
auction mechanism, the distributive online learning converges almost surely
(with probability 1). For illustration, we apply the proposed distributive
stochastic learning framework to an application example with exponential packet
size distribution. We show that the delay-optimal power control has the {\em
multi-level water-filling} structure where the CSI determines the instantaneous
power allocation and the QSI determines the water-level. The proposed algorithm
has linear signaling overhead and computational complexity $\mathcal O(KN)$,
which is desirable from an implementation perspective.

size the cavity resonance frequency and the emitted radiation can be tuned. The

to play a role, possibly arising from nonequilibrium processes at the hot spot

Concretely, several concepts of two-person games and of two-party cryptographic
protocols are here combined in order to model the latters as the formers. One
of the main advantages of analysing a cryptographic protocol in the game-theory
setting is the possibility of describing improved and stronger cryptographic
solutions because possible adversarial behaviours may be taken into account
directly. With those tools, protocols can be studied in a malicious model in
order to find equilibrium conditions that make possible to protect honest
parties against all possible strategies of adversaries.

whereas the linear complexity of shrunken sequences is between $A \cdot

bits. Such a result is proven thanks to the definition of shrunken sequences as
interleaved sequences. Consequently, it is conjectured that this statement can
be extended to all interleaved sequences. Furthermore, this paper confirms that
certain bits of the interleaved sequences have a greater strategic importance
than others, which may be considered as a proof of weakness of interleaved

matrix by a contour integration of the Green function evaluated with a nested
dissection approach for resultant sparse matrices. The computational effort of
the method scales as O($N(\log_2N)^2$), O($N^{2}$), and O($N^{7/3}$) for one,
two, and three dimensional systems, respectively, where $N$ is the number of
basis functions. Unlike O($N$) methods developed so far the approach is a
numerically exact alternative to conventional O($N^{3}$) diagonalization
schemes in spite of the low-order scaling, and can be applicable to not only
insulating but also metallic systems in a single framework. It is also
demonstrated that the nested algorithm and the well separated data structure
are suitable for the massively parallel computation, which enables us to extend
the applicability of density functional calculations for large-scale systems
together with the low-order scaling.
