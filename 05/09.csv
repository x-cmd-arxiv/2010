the Langevin equation analytically. On top of translational and rotational
diffusion, in the context of the presented model, the ""active"" particle is
driven along its internal orientation axis. We calculate the first four moments
of the probability distribution function for displacements as a function of
time for a spherical particle with isotropic translational diffusion as well as
for an anisotropic ellipsoidal particle. In both cases the translational and
rotational motion is either unconfined or confined to one or two dimensions. A
significant non-Gaussian behavior at finite times t is signalled by a
non-vanishing kurtosis. To delimit the super-diffusive regime, which occurs at
intermediate times, two time scales are identified. For certain model
situations a characteristic t^3 behavior of the mean square displacement is
observed. Comparing the dynamics of real and artificial microswimmers like
bacteria or catalytically driven Janus particles to our analytical expressions
reveals whether their motion is Brownian or not.

with spin-orbit coupling may generate pure spin current via direct interband
optical transition. An electric photocurrent can be extracted from the pure
spin current when an in-plane magnetic field is applied, which has been
recently observed in the InGaAs/InAlAs quantum well [Dai et al., Phys. Rev.
Lett. 104, 246601 (2010)]. Here we present a theoretical study of this
magnetoelectric photocurrent effect associated with the interband transition.
By employing the density matrix formalism, we show that the photoexcited
carrier density has an anisotropic distribution in k space, strongly dependent
on the orientation of the electron wavevector and the polarization of the
light. This anisotropy provides an intuitive picture of the observed dependence
of the photocurrent on the magnetic field and the polarization of the light. We
also show that the ratio of the pure spin photocurrent to the magnetoelectric
photocurrent is approximately equal to the ratio of the kinetic energy to the
Zeeman energy, which enables us to estimate the magnitude of the pure spin
photocurrent. The photocurrent density calculated with the help of an
anisotropic Rashba model and the Kohn-Luttinger model can produce all three
terms in the fitting formula for measured current, with comparable order of
magnitude, but discrepancies are still present and further investigation is
needed.

are the composite-system (object plus preparator) state coming about as a
result of a suitable interaction between the subsystems, a suitable preparator
projector called the triggering event, the conditional quantum state (density
operator) of the quantum object coming about as a consequence of the occurrence
of the triggering event on the preparator, and, finally, a unitary evolution
operator of the object subsystem acting after preparation. The concepts of a
general conditional state and of retrospective apparent ideal occurrence (which
appears in the theory) are discussed in considerable detail. Ideal occurrence
and the selective L\""{u}ders formula, which are made use of, are reviewed.

ultracold Fermi gases are adiabatically connected to a projected Fermi gas.
This conclusion is reached by constructing a set of Jastrow wavefunctions,
following Tan's observations on the structure of the physical Hilbert space
[Annals of Physics 323, 2952 (2008)]. The Jastrow projection merely implements
the Bethe-Peierls condition on the BCS and Fermi gas wavefunctions. This
procedure provides a simple picture of the emergence of Fermi polarons as
composite fermions in the normal state of the highly polarized gas. It is also
shown that the projected BCS wavefunction can be written as a condensate of
pairs of composite fermions (or Fermi polarons). A Hamiltonian for the
composite fermions is derived. Within a mean-field theory, it is shown that the

  Limitations",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, the performance of cognitive transmission under quality of
service (QoS)constraints and interference limitations is studied. Cognitive
secondary users are assumed to initially perform sensing over multiple
frequency bands (or equivalently channels) to detect the activities of primary
users. Subsequently, they perform transmission in a single channel at variable
power and rates depending on the channel sensing decisions and the fading
environment. A state transition model is constructed to model this cognitive
operation. Statistical limitations on the buffer lengths are imposed to take
into account the QoS constraints of the cognitive secondary users. Under such
QoS constraints and limitations on the interference caused to the primary
users, the maximum throughput is identified by finding the effective capacity
of the cognitive radio channel. Optimal power allocation strategies are
obtained and the optimal channel selection criterion is identified. The
intricate interplay between effective capacity, interference and QoS
constraints, channel sensing parameters and reliability, fading, and the number
of available frequency bands is investigated through numerical results.

uncertainties such as timing and frequency offset, IQ-imbalance and uncertainty

detectors to mitigate the effects of these impairments. The performance of the
proposed algorithms are studied via simulations. It is shown that energy
detector performs significantly better than the CP-based detector, except in
case of a snapshot detector with noise power uncertainty. Also, unlike for the

EuFe$_2$As$_2$ in the spin-density wave (SDW) state is investigated within
density functional theory (DFT) in the framework of spin-polarized generalized
gradient approximation (GGA) and GGA+U. We find a strong dependence of the
optical features on the Fe magnetic moments. In order to recover the small Fe
magnetic moments observed experimentally, GGA+$U_{\rm eff}$ with a suitable
choice of negative on-site interaction $U_{\rm eff}=U-J$ was considered. Such
an approach may be justified in terms of an overscreening which induces a
relatively small U compared to the Hund's rule coupling J, as well as a strong
Holstein-like electron-phonon interaction. Moreover, reminiscent of the fact
that GGA+$U_{\rm eff}$ with a positive $U_{\rm eff}$ is a simple approximation
for reproducing a gap with correct amplitude in correlated insulators, a
negative $U_{\rm eff}$ can also be understood as a way to suppress magnetism
and mimic the effects of quantum fluctuations ignored in DFT calculations. With
these considerations, the resulting optical spectra reproduce the SDW gap and a
number of experimentally observed features related to the antiferromagnetic
order. We find electronic contributions to excitations that so far have been
attributed to purely phononic modes. Also, an orbital resolved analysis of the
optical conductivity reveals significant contributions from all Fe 3d orbitals.
Finally, we observe that there is an important renormalization of kinetic
energy in these SDW metals, implying that the effects of correlations cannot be
neglected.

simulations with spectral element method. The solutions are called
""convective"", ""transition"", and ""elastic"" in ascending order of Wi. In the
convective region in the Re-Wi parameter space, the convective effect and the
pressure gradient balance on average. As Wi increases, the elastic effect
becomes suddenly comparable and the first transition sets in. Through the
transition, a separation vortex disappears and a jet flow induced close to the
wall by the viscoelasticity moves into the bulk; The viscous drag significantly
drops and the elastic wall friction rises sharply. This transition is caused by
an elastic force in the streamwise direction due to the competition of the
convective and elastic effects. In the transition region, the convective and
elastic effects balance. When the elastic effect dominates the convective
effect, the second transition occurs but it is relatively moderate. The second
one seems to be governed by so-called Weissenberg effect. These transitions are
not sensitive to driving forces. By the scaling analysis, it is shown that the
stress component is proportional to the Reynolds number on the boundary of the
first transition in the Re-Wi space. This scaling coincides well with the

extragalactic gamma-ray background radiation (EGRB) from star-forming galaxies,
based on a state-of-the-art model of hierarchical galaxy formation that is in
quantitative agreement with a variety of observations of local and
high-redshift galaxies. Gamma-ray luminosity ($L_\gamma$) and spectrum of
galaxies are related to star formation rate ($\psi$), gas mass ($M_gas$), and
star formation mode (quiescent or starburst) of model galaxies using latest
observed data of nearby galaxies. We try the two limiting cases about gamma-ray
production: the escape limit ($L_\gamma \propto \psi M_gas$) and the
calorimetric limit ($L_\gamma \propto \psi$), and our standard model predicts 7
and 4% contribution from star-forming galaxies to the total EGRB flux
(including bright resolved sources) recently reported by the Fermi Gamma-Ray
Space Telescope. Systematic uncertainties do not allow us to determine the EGRB
flux better than by a factor of ~2. The predicted number of nearby galaxies
detectable by Fermi is consistent with the observation. Intergalactic
absorption by pair-production attenuates the EGRB flux only by a modest factor
of ~1.3 at the highest Fermi energy band, and the reprocessed cascade emission
does not significantly alter EGRB at lower photon energies. The sum of the
known contributions from AGNs and star-forming galaxies can explain a large
part of EGRB, with a remarkable agreement between the predicted model spectrum
and observation.

defined as the largest constant $c(H)\in (0,1]$ such that no matter how we map
the vertices of $H$ into $\R^d$, there is a point covered by at least a
$c(H)$-fraction of the simplices induced by the images of its hyperedges.
In~\cite{Gro2}, motivated by the search for an analogue of the notion of graph
expansion for higher dimensional simplicial complexes, it was asked whether or
not there exists a sequence $\{H_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ of arbitrarily large
$(d+1)$-uniform hypergraphs with bounded degree, for which $\inf_{n\ge 1}
c(H_n)>0$. Using both random methods and explicit constructions, we answer this
question positively by constructing infinite families of $(d+1)$-uniform
hypergraphs with bounded degree such that their overlap numbers are bounded
from below by a positive constant $c=c(d)$. We also show that, for every $d$,
the best value of the constant $c=c(d)$ that can be achieved by such a
construction is asymptotically equal to the limit of the overlap numbers of the
complete $(d+1)$-uniform hypergraphs with $n$ vertices, as
$n\rightarrow\infty$. For the proof of the latter statement, we establish the
following geometric partitioning result of independent interest. For any $d$
and any $\epsilon>0$, there exists $K=K(\epsilon,d)\ge d+1$ satisfying the
following condition. For any $k\ge K$, for any point $q \in \mathbb{R}^d$ and
for any finite Borel measure $\mu$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$ with respect to which
every hyperplane has measure $0$, there is a partition $\mathbb{R}^d=A_1 \cup
\ldots \cup A_{k}$ into $k$ measurable parts of equal measure such that all but
at most an $\epsilon$-fraction of the $(d+1)$-tuples
$A_{i_1},\ldots,A_{i_{d+1}}$ have the property that either all simplices with
one vertex in each $A_{i_j}$ contain $q$ or none of these simplices contain
$q$.

of a compact SZE `hole' in the galaxy cluster. The SZE hole does not correspond
to any bright feature in X-ray, optical or lensing maps; in general, the
relatively deeper SZE features appear to avoid the regions with the most
intense X-ray emission. These imply that the gas pressure distribution differs
significantly from the distributions in gas emission measure, galaxy and dark
matter distributions. This has implications for the gas physics and evolution
in the cluster merger event. SZE displaced from X-ray centres implies that
modeling cluster dynamics is non-trivial; our observations indicate that our
current lack of understanding cluster merger astrophysics may be a limitation
to modeling the cosmological distribution in SZE cluster counts and the cluster
SZE contribution to small-angle cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy.
The SZE distribution in the western parts of the cluster are cospatial with the
radio halo indicative of a common origin for the hot and relativistic electrons
in the turbulent wake of the Bullet.

  Optical tweezers have been successfully used with Newtonian fluids for

optical tweezers are used to measure the viscoelastic properties of complex
fluids the results are either limited to the material's high-frequency
response, discarding important information related to the low-frequency
behavior, or they are supplemented by low-frequency measurements performed with
different techniques, often without presenting an overlapping region of clear
agreement between the sets of results. We present a simple experimental
procedure to perform microrheological measurements over the widest frequency
range possible with optical tweezers. A generalised Langevin equation is used
to relate the frequency-dependent moduli of the complex fluid to the
time-dependent trajectory of a probe particle as it flips between two optical
