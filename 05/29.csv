theorem regarding quaternion algebras over number fields. Let $\mathfrak A$ be
a quaternion algebra over a number field $K$ and assume that $\mathfrak A$
satisfies the Eichler condition; that is, there exists an archimedean prime of
$K$ which does not ramify in $\mathfrak A$. Let $\Omega$ be a commutative,
quadratic $\mathcal{O}_K$-order and let $\mathcal{R}\subset \mathfrak A$ be an
order of full rank. Assume that there exists an embedding of $\Omega$ into
$\mathcal R$. We describe a number of criteria which, if satisfied, imply that
every order in the genus of $\mathcal R$ admits an embedding of $\Omega$. In
the case that the relative discriminant ideal of $\Omega$ is coprime to the
level of $\mathcal R$ and the level of $\mathcal R$ is coprime to the
discriminant of $\mathfrak A$, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for
an order in the genus of $\mathcal R$ to admit an embedding of $\Omega$. We
explicitly parameterize the isomorphism classes of orders in the genus of
$\mathcal R$ which admit an embedding of $\Omega$. In particular, we show that
the proportion of the genus of $\mathcal{R}$ admitting an embedding of $\Omega$
is either 0, 1/2 or 1. Analogous statements are proven for optimal embeddings.

dynamics simulations in the 0-66 wt % concentration range. The low-frequency
vibrational densities of states (VDOS) of water were compared with the
susceptibilities chi"" of 0-40 wt % solutions of trehalose in D2O obtained from
complementary Raman scattering experiments. Both reveal that sugars
significantly stiffen the local environments experienced by water. Accordingly,
its translational diffusion coefficient decreases when the sugar concentration
increases, as a result of an increase of water-water hydrogen bonds lifetimes
and of the corresponding activation energies. This induced slowing down of
water dynamics, ascribed to the numerous hydrogen bonds that sugars form with
water, is strongly amplified at concentrations above 40 wt % by the percolation
of the hydrogen bond network of sugars, and may partially explain their
well-known stabilizing effect on proteins in aqueous solutions.

of results concerning strong and weak solutions of the Euler equation, we
derive interface equations (such as the Birkhoff-Rott equation) that describe
the motion of the interface. A linear analysis allows us to exhibit the main
features of these equations (such as ellipticity properties); the consequences
for the full, non linear, equations are then described. In particular, the
solutions of the Kelvin-Helmholtz and Rayleigh-Taylor problems are necessarily
analytic if they are above a certain threshold of regularity (a consequence is
the illposedness of the initial value problem in a non analytic framework). We
also say a few words on the phenomena that may occur below this regularity
threshold. Finally, special attention is given to the water waves problem,
which is much more stable than the Kelvin-Helmholtz and Rayleigh-Taylor
configurations. Most of the results presented here are in 2d (the interface has
dimension one), but we give a brief description of similarities and differences

possess magnetic helicity of opposite sign at large and small scales,
respectively. The build-up of magnetic helicity at small scales provides an
important saturation mechanism. In order to understand the nature of the solar
dynamo we need to understand the details of the saturation mechanism in
spherical geometry. In particular, we want to understand the effects of
magnetic helicity fluxes from turbulence and meridional circulation. We
consider a model with just radial shear confined to a thin layer (tachocline)
at the bottom of the convection zone. The kinetic alpha owing to helical
turbulence is assumed to be localized in a region above the convection zone.
The dynamical quenching formalism is used to describe the build-up of mean
magnetic helicity in the model, which results in a magnetic alpha effect that
feeds back on the kinetic alpha effect. In some cases we compare with results
obtained using a simple algebraic alpha quenching formula. In agreement with
earlier findings, the magnetic alpha effect in the dynamical alpha quenching
formalism has the opposite sign compared with the kinetic alpha effect and
leads to a catastrophic decrease of the saturation field strength with
increasing magnetic Reynolds numbers. However, at high latitudes this quenching
effect can lead to secondary dynamo waves that propagate poleward due to the
opposite sign of alpha. Magnetic helicity fluxes both from turbulent mixing and
from meridional circulation alleviate catastrophic quenching.

we also develop a set of semi-analytical equations. The key observations are:
(1) A strongly energy-quantized nanowire shows non-monotonic multiple peak C-V
characteristics due to discrete contributions from individual subbands; (2) The
ballistic drain current saturates better in the UQCL compared to CCL, both in
presence and absence of $D_{it}$ and $R_{s,d}$; (3) The subthreshold slope does
not suffer any relative degradation in the UQCL compared to CCL, even with

The iterative procedure uses a a matrix-free GMRES method to determine the

the speed of our TDDFT code comparable with codes based on Casida's equation.

performance is important. In this paper, we focus on the problem of efficiently
approximate the posterior Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) in a recursive manner.
By using Gaussian assumptions, two types of approximations for calculating the
CRLB are proposed: An exact model using the state estimate as well as a
Taylor-series-expanded model using both of the state estimate and its error
covariance, are derived. Moreover, the difference between the two approximated
CRLBs is also formulated analytically. By employing the particle filter (PF)
and the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) to compute, simulation results reveal
that the approximated CRLB using mean-covariance-based model outperforms that
using the mean-based exact model. It is also shown that the theoretical
difference between the estimated CRLBs can be improved through an improved
filtering method.

For these calculations, we employ two different types of gauge configurations:
(i) 2+1 flavor full QCD configurations generated by the PACS-CS collaboration
at $\beta=1.9$ ($a=0.0907(13)$ fm) on a $32^3\times 64$ lattice, whose spatial
volume is (2.90 fm)$^3$, with the quark masses corresponding to
$(m_\pi,m_K)\approx (301,592)$, $(414,637)$, $(570,724)$ and $(699,787)$ (in
units of MeV). (ii) Quenched QCD configurations at $\beta=5.7$ ($a=0.1416(9)$

quark masses corresponding to $(m_\pi,m_K)\approx (512,606)$, $(464, 586)$ and
$(407,565)$. The following qualitative features are found: The LN potential has
a relatively strong (weak) repulsive core in the $^1S_0$ ($^3S_1$) channel at
short distance, while the potential has slight attractive region at medium
distance. The tensor potential is found to be weaker than the $NN$ case. These
results hold in both full and quenched QCD. The energy of the ground state on
the finite lattice volume is calculated: In both spin channels, energy shift
due to the finite volume, from which we extract the scattering length via the
L\""{u}scher's formula, is found to be negative at all values of quark masses,
suggesting that the LN interaction is attractive. We have also discussed the
quark mass dependences of the potentials and the scattering lengths.

asteroid in 307 images of its resolved apparent disk obtained with adaptive
optics (AO) at Keck II and VLT, and combine these with recent mass
determinations to estimate a bulk density. Our best triaxial ellipsoid
diameters for Lutetia, based on our AO images alone, are a x b x c = 132 x 101

with a rotational pole within 5 deg. of ECJ2000 [long,lat] = [45, -7], or
EQJ2000 [RA, DEC] = [44, +9]. The AO model fit itself has internal precisions
of 1 x 1 x 8 km, but it is evident, both from this model derived from limited
viewing aspects and the radius vector model given in a companion paper, that
Lutetia has significant departures from an idealized ellipsoid. In particular,
the long axis may be overestimated from the AO images alone by about 10 km.
Therefore, we combine the best aspects of the radius vector and ellipsoid model
into a hybrid ellipsoid model, as our final result, of 124 +/- 5 x 101 +/- 4 x
93 +/- 13 km that can be used to estimate volumes, sizes, and projected areas.
The adopted pole position is within 5 deg. of [long, lat] = [52, -6] or[RA DEC]

Ramsauer model is well known and widely applied to understand systematics of
neutron nucleus total cross sections. In this work, we examined the role of
nuclear effective radius parameter (r$_0$) on Ramsauer model fits of neutron
total cross sections. We performed Ramsauer model global analysis of the
experimental neutron total cross sections reported by W. P. Abfalterer, F. B.
Bateman, {\it et. al.,}, from 20MeV to 550MeV for nuclei ranging from Be to U .
The global fit functions which can fit total cross section data over periodic

fits predict within $\pm 8%$ deviation to data, showing the scope for
improvement. It has been observed that a finer adjustment of r$_0$ parameter
alone can give very good Ramsauer model description of neutron total scattering
data within $\pm 4%$ deviation. The required r$_0$ values for Ramsauer model
fits are shown as a function of nuclear mass number and an empirical formula is
suggested for r$_0$ values as a function of mass number. In optical model
approach for neutron scattering, we have modified the real part of

the mass of the compact object - is not known. Nor is it even clear whether its

broad-band high-energy continua covering a substantial range in luminosity and
spectral morphology. We apply these results to a recently identified scaling
relationship which has been demonstrated to provide reliable estimates of the
compact object mass in a number of accretion powered binaries. This analysis
leads us to conclude that the compact object in Cygnus X-3 has a mass greater
than $4.2M_\odot$ thus clearly indicative of a black hole and as such resolving
a long-standing issue. The full range of uncertainty in our analysis and from
using a range of recently published distance estimates constrains the compact
object mass to lie between $4.2M_\odot$ and $14.4M_\odot$. Our favored
estimate, based on a 9.0 kpc distance estimate is $\sim 10 M_\odot$ with the

$\approx\unit[10^{6}]{Hz}$ and the $1/f$ component is stronger in the

it is a member of the SU UMa family. At its brightest, the star was magnitude
15.7. The outburst amplitude was nearly 5 magnitudes and it lasted about 14
days. We determined the mean superhump period from our first 3 nights of
observations as Psh = 0.07979(19) d, however analysis of the O-C residuals
showed a dramatic evolution in Psh during the outburst. During the first part
of the plateau phase the period increased with dPsh/dt = +2.81(9) x 10-3. There
was then an abrupt change following which the period decreased with dPsh/dt =
-0.78(12)x 10-3.The amplitude of the superhumps also varied, with a maximum
amplitude near the beginning of the outburst and a second maximum later in the
plateau phase. Analysis of archival data suggests that the star undergoes
frequent outbursts: we identified 10 normal outbursts and at least 3 likely
superoutbursts over a 4.5 year interval. We estimate that the superoutburst
period is around 215 days.

approximated by the connected sum of a minimal solution with an instanton, plus
a correction term due to the boundary. An auxiliary equation is introduced that
allows us to solve the problem orthogonally to the tangent space to the space

via the Ljusternik-Schirelman theory, and the existence proofs are completed.
In Part III, we prove that the space of gauge equivalence classes of Sobolev
connections with prescribed boundary value is a smooth manifold, as well as
some technical lemmas used in Part I. The methods employed still work when the

binaries against repeated encounters with dark substructures orbiting in the
dark matter haloes of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs). Our models adopt
cosmologically-motivated conditions wherein dSphs are dark-matter dominated
systems that form hierarchically and orbit about a host galaxy. Our analytical
estimates show that wide binaries are disrupted at a rate that is proportional
to the local density of dark substructures averaged over the life-time of the
binary population. The fact that external tides can efficiently strip dark
substructures from the outskirts of dSphs implies that the present number and
distribution of binaries is strongly coupled with the mass evolution of
individual galaxies. Yet we show that for the range of dynamical masses and
Galactocentric distances spanned by Milky Way dSphs, a truncation in the
separation function at a_max <~ 0.1 pc is expected in all these galaxies. An
exception may be the Sagittarius dSph, which has lost most of is dark matter
envelope to tides and is close to full disruption. Our simulations indicate
that at separations larger than a_max the perturbed binary distribution scales
as dN/da \propto a^{-2.1} independently of the mass and density of
substructures. These results may be used to determine whether the binary
separation function found in dwarf galaxies is compatible with the scale-free
hierarchical picture that envisions the existence of dark substructures in all
galactic haloes. We show that the ACS camera on board of the Hubble telescope
may be able to test this prediction in dSphs at heliocentric distances <100
kpc, even if the binary fraction amounts only 10% of the stellar population.

galaxy have recently been developed that for the first time simultaneously
satisfy most observational constraints on the angular position, distance, and
radial velocity trends of both leading and trailing tidal streams emanating
from the dwarf. We use these dynamical models in combination with extant 3-D
position and velocity data for Galactic globular clusters and dSph galaxies to
identify those Milky Way satellites that are likely to have originally formed
in Sgr and been stripped from it during its extended interaction with the Milky
Way. We conclude that the globular clusters Arp 2, M 54, NGC 5634, Terzan 8,
and Whiting 1 are likely associated with the Sgr dwarf, and that Berkeley 29,
NGC 5053, Pal 12, and Terzan 7 may be as well. The initial Sgr system therefore
may have contained 5-9 globular clusters, corresponding to a specific frequency
S_N = 5 - 9 for an initial Sgr luminosity M_V = -15.0. Our result is consistent
with the 8\pm2 Sgr globular clusters expected from statistical modeling of the
Galactic globular cluster distribution and the corresponding false-association
rate due to chance alignments with the Sgr streams. These clusters are
consistent with previous reconstructions of the Sgr age-metallicity relation,
and show no evidence for a second-parameter effect shaping their horizontal
branch morphologies. We find no statistically significant evidence to suggest
that any of the recently discovered population of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies
are conclusively associated with the Sgr tidal streams. (Abridged).

the standard model gauge group augmented by an additional gauged U(1)_{B-L}.
Their minimal content requires that the B-L gauge symmetry be spontaneously

previous papers, we presented the results of a quasi-analytic renormalization

calculating all renormalization group equations numerically, without

deformation of the canonical morphism of such surfaces $X$ is again a morphism
of degree 2. A priori, this is not at all obvious, for the invariants
$(p_g(X),c_1^2(X))$ of most of these surfaces lie on or above the Castelnuovo
line; thus, in principle, a deformation of such $X$ could have a birational
canonical map. We also map the region of the geography of surfaces of general
type corresponding to the invariants of the surfaces $X$ and we compute the
dimension of the irreducible moduli component containing $[X]$. In certain
cases we exhibit some interesting moduli components parametrizing surfaces $S$
whose canonical map has different behavior but whose invariants are the same as
the invariants of $X$. One of the interests of the article is that we prove the
results about moduli spaces employing crucially techniques on deformation of
morphisms. The key point or our arguments is the use of a criterion that
requires only infinitesimal, cohomological information of the canonical
morphism of $X$. As a by-product, we also prove the non-existence of
""canonically"" embedded multiple structures on minimal rational surfaces and on

eikonal resummation suggests why short distance phenomena and in particular
divergences or nonrenormalizability do not necessarily play a central role in
this regime. A more profound problem is apparently unitarity. These
considerations can be illustrated by showing that known gravity and
supergravity amplitudes have the same long-distance behavior, despite the extra
light states of supergravity, and this serves as an important check on
long-range dynamics in a context where perturbative amplitudes are finite. We
also argue that these considerations have other important implications: they
obstruct probing the conjectured phenomenon of asymptotic safety through a
physical scattering process, and ultraplanckian scattering exhibiting Regge
behavior. These arguments sharpen the need to find a nonperturbative completion
of gravity with mechanisms which restore unitarity in the strong gravity
regime.

transmits to its destination with the help of a set of cooperating nodes. The
source first transmits locally. The cooperating nodes that receive the source
signal retransmit a weighted version of it in an amplify-and-forward (AF)
fashion. Assuming knowledge of the second-order statistics of the channel state
information, beamforming weights are determined so that the signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) at the destination is maximized subject to two different power
constraints, i.e., a total (source and relay) power constraint, and individual
relay power constraints. For the former constraint, the original problem is
transformed into a problem of one variable, which can be solved via Newton's
method. For the latter constraint, the original problem is transformed into a
homogeneous quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problem. In
this case, it is shown that when the number of relays does not exceed three the
global solution can always be constructed via semidefinite programming (SDP)

control pulses to enable the design of numerically optimized, two-dimensional
control functions with bounded amplitude, that are capable of decoupling the
qubit from the dephasing effects of a broad variety of Markovian noise spectral
densities during arbitrary one qubit quantum operations. We illustrate the
method with development of numerically optimized control pulse sequences that
minimize decoherence due to a combination of $1/\omega$ and constant offset

protocols shows that the numerically optimized pulse sequences are considerably
more robust with respect to the noise offset, rendering them attractive for
application to situations where homogeneous dephasing noise sources are

model on the basis of Wilson's numerical renormalization group method. The
f-electron charge susceptibility diverges logarithmically at the critical point
of this model when conduction-electron bands exhibit particle-hole symmetry.
Although the critical point disappears without the particle-hole symmetry, the
f-electron charge fluctuation is much more enhanced near the crossover regime
between the Kondo-Yosida singlet and intersite spin-singlet states than that in
the single-impurity case. This result shows that charge fluctuations are
enhanced owing to the competition between intersite and Kondo-Yosida spin

region where the Kondo temperature becomes comparable with the N\'eel

stage in a long period of the database research area. ? The characteristics of
P2P systems (e.g. large-scale, node autonomy and instability) make impractical
to have a global catalog that represents often an essential component in
traditional database systems. Usually, such a catalog stores information about
data, schemas and data sources. Query routing and processing are two problems
affected by the absence of a global catalog. Locating relevant data sources and
generating a close to optimal execution plan become more difficult. In this

metaalgorithmic techniques. It was introduced by Demaine et al. as a tool to
obtain sub-exponential time parameterized algorithms for problems on H-minor
free graphs. Demaine and Hajiaghayi extended the theory to obtain PTASs for
bidimensional problems, and subsequently improved these results to EPTASs.
Fomin et. al related the theory to the existence of linear kernels for
parameterized problems. In this paper we revisit bidimensionality theory from
the perspective of approximation algorithms and redesign the framework for
obtaining EPTASs to be more powerful, easier to apply and easier to understand.
  Two of the most widely used approaches to obtain PTASs on planar graphs are
the Lipton-Tarjan separator based approach, and Baker's approach. Demaine and
Hajiaghayi strengthened both approaches using bidimensionality and obtained
EPTASs for a multitude of problems. We unify the two strenghtened approaches to
combine the best of both worlds. At the heart of our framework is a
decomposition lemma which states that for ""most"" bidimensional problems, there
is a polynomial time algorithm which given an H-minor-free graph G as input and
an e > 0 outputs a vertex set X of size e * OPT such that the treewidth of G n
X is f(e). Here, OPT is the objective function value of the problem in question
and f is a function depending only on e. This allows us to obtain EPTASs on
(apex)-minor-free graphs for all problems covered by the previous framework, as
well as for a wide range of packing problems, partial covering problems and
problems that are neither closed under taking minors, nor contractions. To the
best of our knowledge for many of these problems including cycle packing,
vertex-h-packing, maximum leaf spanning tree, and partial r-dominating set no
EPTASs on planar graphs were previously known.

spatial evolutionary game on a variety of spatial structures, involving regular
lattice, continuous plane and complex networks. A striking finding is that
migration plays a universal role in cooperation, regardless of the spatial
structures. For high degree of migration, cooperators cannot survive due to the
failure of forming cooperator clusters to resist attacks of defectors. While
for low degree of migration, cooperation is considerably enhanced compared to
statically spatial game, which is due to the strengthening of the boundary of
cooperator clusters by the occasionally accumulation of cooperators along the
boundary. The cooperator cluster thus becomes more robust than that in static
game and defectors nearby the boundary can be assimilated by cooperators, so
the cooperator cluster expands, which facilitates cooperation. The general role
of migration will be substantiated by sufficient simulations associated with
heuristic explanations.

Newtonian dynamics (MOND), because in most of these galaxies the accelerations
fall below the threshold below where MOND supposedly applies. We have selected
from the literature a sample of 27 dwarf and low surface brightness galaxies.
MOND is successful in explaining the general shape of the observed rotation
curves for roughly three quarters of the galaxies in the sample presented here.
However, for the remaining quarter, MOND does not adequately explain the
observed rotation curves. Considering the uncertainties in distances and
inclinations for the galaxies in our sample, a small fraction of poor MOND
predictions is expected and is not necessarily a problem for MOND. We have also
made fits taking the MOND acceleration constant, a_0, as a free parameter in
order to identify any systematic trends. We find that there appears to be a
correlation between central surface brightness and the best-fit value of a_0,
in the sense that lower surface brightness galaxies tend to have lower a_0.
However, this correlation depends strongly on a small number of galaxies whose
rotation curves might be uncertain due to either bars or warps. Without these
galaxies, there is less evidence of a trend, but the average value we find for
a_0 ~ 0.7*10^-8 cm s^-2 is somewhat lower than derived from previous studies.
Such lower fitted values of a_0 could occur if external gravitational fields
are important.
