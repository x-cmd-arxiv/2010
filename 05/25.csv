such that the $i$-th character of $v$ is greater than or equal to the $i$-th
character of $u$ for all $i$. This subword $v$ is called an embedding of $u$
into $w$. For the case where $P$ is the positive integers with the usual

$\text{wt}(w) = x^{\sum_{i=1}^n w_i} t^{n}$, and the corresponding weight
generating function $F(u;t,x) = \sum_{w \geq_P u} \text{wt}(w)$. They then
defined two words $u$ and $v$ to be Wilf equivalent, denoted $u \backsim v$, if

decreasing word. We use this formula as an aid to classify Wilf equivalence for

discuss a conjecture that if $u \backsim v$ then $u$ and $v$ must be
rearrangements, and the stronger conjecture that there also must be a

networks. We present a systematic empirical analysis of the statistical
properties of communities in large information, communication, technological,
biological, and social networks. We find that the mesoscopic organization of
networks of the same category is remarkably similar. This is reflected in
several characteristics of community structure, which can be used as
``fingerprints'' of specific network categories. While community size
distributions are always broad, certain categories of networks consist mainly
of tree-like communities, while others have denser modules. Average path
lengths within communities initially grow logarithmically with community size,
but the growth saturates or slows down for communities larger than a
characteristic size. This behaviour is related to the presence of hubs within
communities, whose roles differ across categories. Also the community
embeddedness of nodes, measured in terms of the fraction of links within their
communities, has a characteristic distribution for each category. Our findings
are verified by the use of two fundamentally different community detection
methods.

encode relationships between terms in types and can naturally capture

language can provide the benefits of a Twelf-like system for encoding type and
proof-and-formula dependencies. In particular, we present a simple mapping from
LF specifications to a set of formulas in the higher-order hereditary Harrop

frameworks. We then show that this encoding can be improved by exploiting
knowledge of the well-formedness of the original LF specifications to elide
much redundant type-checking information. The resulting logic program has a
structure that closely resembles the original specification, thereby allowing
LF specifications to be viewed as hohh meta-programs. Using the Teyjus

to look for possible light curve variability of the same nature as that
observed in the classical T Tauri star AA Tau, which was attributed to a
magnetically controlled inner disk warp, which is directly associated with the
interaction between the stellar magnetic field and the inner disk region. We
analysed the Corot light curves of 83 previously known classical T Tauri stars
that belong to NGC 2264 and classified them according to their morphology. We
also studied the Corot light curve morphology as a function of a Spitzer-based
classification of the star-disk systems. The classification derived on the
basis of the Corot light curve morphology agrees very well with the Spitzer
IRAC-based classification of the systems. The percentage of AA Tau-like light
curves decreases as the inner disk dissipates, from 40% +- 10% in systems with
thick inner disks to 36% +- 16% in systems with anemic disks and none in naked
photosphere systems. Indeed, 91% +- 29% of the CTTS with naked photospheres
exhibit pure spot-like variability, while only 18% +- 7% of the thick disk
systems do so, presumably those seen at low inclination and thus free of
variable obscuration. AA Tau-like light curves are found to be fairly common,
with a frequency of at least ~ 30 to 40% in young stars with inner dusty disks.
The temporal evolution of the light curves indicates that the structure of the
inner disk warp, located close to the corotation radius and responsible for the
obscuration episodes, varies over a timescale of a few (~ 1-3) rotational
periods. This probably reflects the highly dynamical nature of the star-disk
magnetospheric interaction.

one-loop level for several string solutions in AdS_3 x S^1 embedded into AdS_5

strings are equivalent to respective fluctuations found from the Nambu action
in the original string theory. We also show the equivalence of fluctuation
frequencies for homogeneous strings with both the orbital momentum and the

flux theorem for gravity, it follows that the gravitational field of the
visible universe can be calculated as if the entire mass of the visible
universe is located in one point. Taking into account that the mass of the
visible universe is M=2x10^{53} kg, it appears that the entire visible universe
is inside a {\it photon sphere} of radius R_{ps} = 14.3 Gpc. The current model
for the visible universe must be corrected to account for the fact that
measured horizon distance of 14.0 \pm 0.2 Gpc is not a straight line. Rather it
is an arc of a circle with that length, because all photons are inside the
photon sphere. Our model interprets the visible universe as a surface of a
sphere (or an inside of a sphere shell) with radius 4.46 \pm 0.06 Gpc and an
event horizon, located on that sphere (shell), with size of 14.0 \pm 0.2 Gpc.
The model predicts CMB redshift and time dilatation of Type Ia supernovae by
gravitation. It explains, without inflation theory, the isotropy and uniformity
of the CMB. It predicts the correct value for the Hubble constant H_0 = 67.26
\pm 0.90 km/s/Mpc, the cosmic expansion rate H(z) in agreement with
observations, and the speed of the event horizon. Through relativistic energy
correction, our model also provides an explanation for critical density without
use of dark matter. It explains that Type Ia supernovae redshifts are not
related to the accelerated expansion of the universe and dark energy. It
explains the reason for the established discrepancy between the non-covariant
version of the holographic principle and the calculated dimensionless entropy
(S/k) for the visible universe, which exceeds the entropy of a black hole. The
model is in agreement with the distribution of radio sources in space, Type Ia
data, and data from the HUDF optical and near-infrared survey.

cold absorbing material in a intervening molecular cloud of the Perseus star
forming region where various experiments have recently detected anomalous
microwave emission. From the measured intensity and available oscillator
strength we find a column density of N$_{an^+}$= 1.1(+-0.4) x 10$^{13}$

of C$_{14}$H$_{10}$$^+$. A similar abundance has been recently claimed for the
naphthalene cation (Iglesias-Groth et al. 2008) in this cloud. This is the
first location outside the Solar System where specific PAHs are identified. We
report observations of interstellar lines of CH and CH$^+$ that support a
rather high column density for these species and for molecular hydrogen. The
strength ratio of the two prominent diffuse interstellar bands at 5780 and 5797
\AA suggests the presence of a ``zeta'' type cloud in the line of sight
(consistent with steep far-UV extinction and high molecular content). The
presence of PAH cations and other related hydrogenated carbon molecules which
are likely to occur in this type of clouds reinforce the suggestion that
electric dipole radiation from fast spinning PAHs is responsible of the
anomalous microwave emission detected toward Perseus.

arc therapy (VMAT) treatment plan optimization with high quality and high
efficiency. Methods: The VMAT optimization problem is formulated as a
large-scale convex programming problem solved by a column generation approach.
We consider a cost function consisting two terms, the first which enforces a
desired dose distribution while the second guarantees a smooth dose rate
variation between successive gantry angles. At each iteration of the column
generation method, a subproblem is first solved to generate one more
deliverable MLC aperture which potentially decreases the cost function most
effectively. A subsequent master problem is then solved to determine the dose
rate at all currently generated apertures by minimizing the cost function. The
iteration of such an algorithm yields a set of deliverable apertures, as well
as dose rates, at all gantry angles. Results: The algorithm was preliminarily
tested on five prostate and five head-and-neck clinical cases, each with one
full gantry rotation and without any couch/collimator rotations. Compared to
corresponding co-planar IMRT treatment plans (9 fields for prostate cases and 5
fields for head-and-neck cases), the VMAT plans delivered much lower doses to
critical structures and more conformal doses to targets. Moreover, extremely
high efficiency has been achieved in our algorithm. It takes only 5~8 minutes
on CPU (MATLAB code on an Intel Xeon 2.27 GHz CPU) and 18~31 seconds on GPU
(CUDA code on an NVIDIA Tesla C1060 GPU card) to generate such a plan.
Conclusions: We have developed an aperture-based VMAT optimization algorithm
which can generate clinically deliverable and high quality treatment plans at
very high efficiency.

non-linear equations describing the time-evolution of a uniform oblate spheroid

yields a dispersion relation which depends on the shell thickness, and hence on
the pressure confining the shell. We compare this dispersion relation with the
dispersion relation obtained using the standard thin-shell analysis, and show
that, if the confining pressure is low, only large fragments are unstable. On

color of quasars as a function of their projected separation from foreground
galaxies, extending to comoving separations of ~10Mpc/h, which they interpret
as a signature of reddening by intergalactic dust. We present theoretical
models of this remarkable observation, using SPH cosmological simulations of a
(50Mpc/h)^3 volume. Our primary model uses a simulation with galactic winds and
assumes that dust traces the intergalactic metals. The predicted galaxy-dust
correlation function is similar in form to the galaxy-mass correlation
function, and reproducing the MSFR data requires a dust-to-metal mass ratio of
0.24, about half the value in the Galactic ISM. Roughly half of the reddening
arises in dust that is more than 100Kpc/h from the nearest massive galaxy. We
also examine a simulation with no galactic winds, which predicts a much smaller
fraction of intergalactic metals (3% vs. 35%) and therefore requires an
unphysical dust-to-metal ratio of 2.18 to reproduce the MSFR data. In both
models, the signal is dominated by sightlines with E(g-i)=0.001-0.1. The
no-wind simulation can be reconciled with the data if we also allow reddening
to arise in galaxies up to several x 10^10 Msun. The wind model predicts a mean
visual extinction of A_V ~0.0133 mag out to z=0.5, with a
sightline-to-sightline dispersion similar to the mean, which could be
significant for future supernova cosmology studies. Reproducing the MSFR
results in these simulations requires that a large fraction of ISM dust survive
its expulsion from galaxies and its residence in the intergalactic medium.
Future observational studies that provide higher precision and measure the
dependence on galaxy type and environment will allow detailed tests for models
of enriched galactic outflows and the survival of IG dust.

that many physically distinct nanotori with wildly different parameters

as modular symmetries which are direct consequences of the properties of the

dramatic reduction in the number of spectrally distinct carbon nanotori
compared with the number of physically distinct carbon nanotori. The existence
of these modular symmetries also allows us to demonstrate that many statements
in the literature concerning the electronic properties of nanotori are
incomplete because they fail to respect the spectral equivalences that follow
from these symmetries. We also find that as a result of these modular
symmetries, the fraction of spectrally distinct nanotori which are metallic is
approximately three times greater than would naively be expected on the basis
of standard results in the literature. Finally, we demonstrate that these
modular symmetries also extend to cases in which our carbon nanotori enclose
non-zero magnetic fluxes.

pulsar studies) have required absolute time stamps with precisions of
considerably better than 1 minute for many decades, recently new areas have
crossed into this regime. In particular, in the exoplanet community, we have
found that the (typically unspecified) time standards adopted by various groups
can differ by as much as a minute. Left uncorrected, this ambiguity may be
mistaken for transit timing variations and bias eccentricity measurements. We
argue that, since the commonly-used Julian Date, as well as its heliocentric
and barycentric counterparts, can be specified in several time standards, it is
imperative that their time standards always be reported when accuracies of 1
minute are required. We summarize the rationale behind our recommendation to
quote the site arrival time, in addition to using BJD_TDB, the Barycentric
Julian Date in the Barycentric Dynamical Time standard for any astrophysical
event. The BJD_TDB is the most practical absolute time stamp for
extra-terrestrial phenomena, and is ultimately limited by the properties of the
target system. We compile a general summary of factors that must be considered

Finally, we provide software tools that, in principal, allow one to calculate

In this setting, a managed investment portfolio serves simultaneously as the
underlying security on which the liability/target is contingent and as a

capital-protected investments and performance-linked pay-offs. We give examples

starburst galaxies, and in the majority of galaxies at high redshift. How these
cool outflows arise is still in question. Hot gas from supernovae has long been
suspected as the primary driver, but this mechanism suffers from its tendency
to destroy the cool gas as the latter is accelerated. We propose a modification
of the supernova scenario that overcomes this difficulty.
  Star formation is observed to take place in clusters; in a given galaxy, the
bulk of the star formation is found in the ~20 most massive clusters. We show
that, for L* galaxies, the radiation pressure from clusters with M>10^6 M_sun
is able to expel the surrounding gas at velocities in excess of the circular
velocity of the disk galaxy. This cool gas can travel above the galactic disk
in less than 2 Myr, well before any supernovae erupt in the driving cluster.
Once above the disk, the cool outflowing gas is exposed to radiation, and
supernovae induced hot gas outflows, from other clusters in the disk, which
drive it to distances of several tens to hundreds of kpc. Because the
radiatively driven clouds grow in size as they travel, and because the hot gas
is more dilute at large distance, the clouds are less subject to destruction if
they do eventually encounter hot gas. Therefore, unlike wind driven clouds,
radiatively driven clouds can survive to distances ~50 kpc. We identify these
cluster-driven winds with large-scale galactic outflows. Another implication of
our model is that only starburst galaxies, where massive clusters reside, are
able to drive winds cold outflows on galactic scales via this mechanism. We
find that the critical star formation rates above which large scale cool
outflows will be launched to be ~0.1 M_sun/yr/kpc^2, which is in good agreement
with observations.

ejecta fall into several distinct categories, depending on both the speed and
direction of launch.
  The slowest ejecta follow sub-orbital trajectories and re-impact their source
moon in less than one day. Slightly faster debris barely escape their parent's
Hill sphere and are confined to tadpole orbits, librating about Tethys'
triangular Lagrange points L4 (leading, near Telesto) or L5 (trailing, near
Calypso) with nearly the same orbital semi-major axis as Tethys, Telesto, and
Calypso. These ejecta too eventually re-impact their source moon, but with a

exponential scales. For nonlinear equations, the transseries template is a
two-dimensional array of exponential scales that tilts and realigns asymptotic
balances as the interval is traversed. An exponential asymptotic approach also
reveals how boundary value problems force the surprising presence of
transseries in the linear case and negative powers of epsilon terms in the
series beyond all orders in the nonlinear case. We also demonstrate how these
transseries can be resummed to generate multiple-scales-type approximations

cytochrome f to study temperature dependent protein motion. Classical Normal
Mode Analysis (NMA) assumes harmonic behavior and the protein Mean Square
Displacement (MSD) has a linear dependence on temperature. This is only
consistent with low temperature experimental results. To connect the protein
vibrational motions between low temperature and physiological temperature, we
have incorporated a fitted set of anharmonic potentials into SCNMA. In
addition, Quantum Harmonic Oscillator (QHO) theory has been used to calculate
the displacement distribution for individual vibrational modes. We find that
the modes involving soft bonds exhibit significant non-Gaussian dynamics at
physiological temperature, which suggests it may be the cause of the
non-Gaussian behavior of the protein motions probed by Elastic Incoherent
Neutron Scattering (EINS). The combined theory displays a dynamical transition
caused by the softening of few ""torsional"" modes in the low frequency regime (<
50cm-1or < 6meVor > 0.6ps). These modes change from Gaussian to a classical
distribution upon heating. Our theory provides an alternative way to understand
the microscopic origin of the protein dynamical transition.

investigate the application of a technique to measure tangential motion that

clusters of galaxies far beyond its borders. We show that mapping the mean
line-of-sight motion throughout a galaxy cluster could in principle be used to
detect the ""perspective rotation"" induced by the projection of the cluster's
tangential motion into the line-of-sight. The signal will be most prominent for
clusters of the largest angular extent, most symmetric intrinsic velocity
distribution and surveyed with the largest number of pointings possible. We
investigate the feasibility of detecting this signal using three different
approaches: measuring line-of-sight motions of individual cluster members;
taking spectra of intracluster gas; and mapping distortions of the Cosmic

measuring cluster tangential motions using this technique.

a large class of mixed finite element methods can be formulated naturally on
Hilbert complexes, where using a Galerkin-like approach, one solves a
variational problem on a finite-dimensional subcomplex. In a seemingly
unrelated research direction, Dziuk [Lect Notes in Math, vol 1357 (1988)]
analyzed a class of nodal finite elements for the Laplace-Beltrami equation on
smooth 2-surfaces approximated by a piecewise-linear triangulation; Demlow
later extended this analysis [SIAM J Numer Anal, 47 (2009)] to 3-surfaces, as
well as to higher-order surface approximation. In this article, we bring these
lines of research together, first developing a framework for the analysis of
variational crimes in abstract Hilbert complexes, and then applying this
abstract framework to the setting of finite element exterior calculus on
hypersurfaces. Our framework extends the work of Arnold, Falk, and Winther to
problems that violate their subcomplex assumption, allowing for the extension
of finite element exterior calculus to approximate domains, most notably the
Hodge-de Rham complex on approximate manifolds. As an application of the
latter, we recover Dziuk's and Demlow's a priori estimates for 2- and
3-surfaces, demonstrating that surface finite element methods can be analyzed
completely within this abstract framework. Moreover, our results generalize
these earlier estimates dramatically, extending them from nodal finite elements
for Laplace-Beltrami to mixed finite elements for the Hodge Laplacian, and from
2- and 3-dimensional hypersurfaces to those of arbitrary dimension. By
developing this analytical framework using a combination of general tools from
differential geometry and functional analysis, we are led to a more geometric
analysis of surface finite element methods, whereby the main results become

Constitution data (2009) whereas $D_A$ distances are provided by two samples of
galaxy clusters compiled by De Fillipis et al. (2005) and Bonamente et al.
(2006) by combining Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect (SZE) and X-ray surface

coincide with the ones of the associated galaxy cluster sample (\Delta z<0.005)

D_{A}(z) \approxeq D_{L}(z), we have tested the DD relation by assuming that
$\eta$ is a function of the redshift parametrized by two different expressions:
\eta(z) = 1 + \eta_{0}z and \eta(z) = 1 + \eta_{0}z/(1+z), where \eta_0 is a
constant parameter quantifying a possible departure from the strict validity of
the reciprocity relation (\eta_0=0). In the best scenario (linear
parametrization) we obtain \eta_{0} = -0.28^{+ 0.44}_{- 0.44} (2\sigma$,
statistical + systematic errors) for de Fillipis et al. sample (eliptical

for Bonamente et al. sample (spherical geometry) the constraint is \eta_{0} =

clearly incompatible with the duality-distance relation.

of them taken simultaneously to the X-ray observations. We fit the X-ray
emission lines and decompose the Ha emission line in different components. In
X-rays IM Lup has a bright and hot active corona, where elements of low
first-ionisation potential are depleted. The He-like Ne IX triplet is in the
low-density state, but due to the small number of counts a high-density
scenario cannot be excluded on the 90% confidence level. In all X-ray
properties IM Lup resembles a main-sequence star, but it is also compatible
with CTTS signatures on the 90% confidence level, thus we cannot decide if the
soft excess and deviations from the low-density coronal limit in the He-like
triplets in CTTS require accretion or only the presence of a disk. IM Lup is
chromospherically active, which explains most of the emission in Ha. Despite
its low equivalent width, the complexity of the Ha line profile is reminiscent
of CTTS. We present an estimate for the mass accretion rate of 10e-11 Msun/yr.

based on using multiple trials of a simple RS decoding algorithm in combination
with erasing or flipping a set of symbols or bits in each trial. This paper
presents a framework based on rate-distortion (RD) theory to analyze these
multiple-decoding algorithms. By defining an appropriate distortion measure
between an error pattern and an erasure pattern, the successful decoding
condition, for a single errors-and-erasures decoding trial, becomes equivalent
to distortion being less than a fixed threshold. Finding the best set of
erasure patterns also turns into a covering problem which can be solved
asymptotically by rate-distortion theory. Thus, the proposed approach can be
used to understand the asymptotic performance-versus-complexity trade-off of
multiple errors-and-erasures decoding of RS codes.
  This initial result is also extended a few directions. The rate-distortion
exponent (RDE) is computed to give more precise results for moderate
blocklengths. Multiple trials of algebraic soft-decision (ASD) decoding are
analyzed using this framework. Analytical and numerical computations of the RD
and RDE functions are also presented. Finally, simulation results show that
sets of erasure patterns designed using the proposed methods outperform other

the net amounts of these radiogenic heat-producing elements available for
partitioning to the crust, mantle, and core. Core formation enriches the
abundances of refractory lithophile elements, including U and Th, in the
silicate earth by ~1.5. Global removal of volatile elements potentially
increases this enrichment to ~2.8. The K content of the silicate earth follows
from the ratio of K to U. Variable enrichment produces a range of possible

increasing intensity of interest over the past few years. Distributed solutions
(like the iterative water-filling, gradient projection, etc.) have been
intensively investigated under \emph{quasi-static} channels. However, as such
distributed solutions involve iterative updating and explicit message passing,
it is unrealistic to assume that the wireless channel remains unchanged during
the iterations. Unfortunately, the behavior of those distributed solutions
under \emph{time-varying} channels is in general unknown. In this paper, we
shall investigate the distributed scaled gradient projection algorithm (DSGPA)
in a $K$ pairs multicarrier interference network under a finite-state Markov
channel (FSMC) model. We shall analyze the \emph{convergence property} as well
as \emph{tracking performance} of the proposed DSGPA. Our analysis shows that
the proposed DSGPA converges to a limit region rather than a single point under
the FSMC model. We also show that the order of growth of the tracking errors is
given by $\mathcal{O}\(1 \big/ \bar{N}\)$, where $\bar{N}$ is the \emph{average
sojourn time} of the FSMC. Based on the analysis, we shall derive the
\emph{tracking error optimal scaling matrices} via Markov decision process
modeling. We shall show that the tracking error optimal scaling matrices can be
implemented distributively at each transmitter. The numerical results show the
superior performance of the proposed DSGPA over three baseline schemes, such as
the gradient projection algorithm with a constant stepsize.

phase transition. In favour for the search of such a phase transition in

MIT bag model. We apply this equation of state to highly asymmetric core
collapse supernova matter with finite temperatures and large baryon densities.
The phase transition is constructed using the general Gibbs conditions, which
results in an extended coexistence region between the pure hadronic and pure
quark phases in the phase diagram, i.e. the mixed phase. The supernovae are
simulated via general relativistic radiation hydrodynamics based on three
flavor Boltzmann neutrino transport in spherical symmetry. During the dynamical
evolution temperatures above 10 MeV, baryon densities above nuclear saturation
density and a proton-to-baryon ratio below 0.2 are obtained. At these
conditions the phase transition is triggered which leads to a significant
softening of the EoS for matter in the mixed phase. As a direct consequence of
the stiffening of the EoS again for matter in the pure quark phase, a shock
wave forms at the boundary between the mixed and the pure hadronic phases. This
shock is accelerated and propagates outward which releases a burst of neutrinos
dominated by electron anti-neutrinos due to the lifted degeneracy of the
shock-heated hadronic material. We discuss the radiation-hydrodynamic evolution
of the phase transition at the example of several low and intermediate mass
Fe-core progenitor stars and illustrate the expected neutrino signal from the

The absorption coefficient is derived from a comparison of time-resolved

of the stellar wind with the planetary magnetosphere. Since the wind speed is
subsonic/sub-Alfvenic and comparable to the orbital velocity of the planet, the
head of the magnetopause lies eastward relative to the substellar line (the
line joining the planet and the star). The gas around the magnetopause may, if
sufficiently compressed, give rise to asymmetric ingress/egress during the
planet transit, although more works are needed to evaluate this possibility.

that is, deciding whether a given message M can be deduced from a set of
messages Gamma under the theory of blind signatures and arbitrary convergent
equational theories modulo associativity and commutativity (AC) of certain
binary operators. The traditional formulations of intruder deduction are
usually given in natural-deduction-like systems and proving decidability
requires significant effort in showing that the rules are ""local"" in some
sense. By using the well-known translation between natural deduction and
sequent calculus, we recast the intruder deduction problem as proof search in
sequent calculus, in which locality is immediate. Using standard proof
theoretic methods, such as permutability of rules and cut elimination, we show
that the intruder deduction problem can be reduced, in polynomial time, to the
elementary deduction problem, which amounts to solving certain equations in the
underlying individual equational theories. We show that this result extends to
combinations of disjoint AC-convergent theories whereby the decidability of
intruder deduction under the combined theory reduces to the decidability of
elementary deduction in each constituent theory. To further demonstrate the
utility of the sequent-based approach, we show that, for Dolev-Yao intruders,
our sequent-based techniques can be used to solve the more difficult problem of
solving deducibility constraints, where the sequents to be deduced may contain
gaps (or variables) representing possible messages the intruder may produce.

The sudden transition from classical to quantum decoherence regime is observed
during the dynamics of such kind of Bell diagonal state. Due to the refocusing
effect of the overall relative phase, the quantum correlation revives from near
zero and then decays again in the subsequent evolution. However, the
non-Markovian effect is too weak to revive the classical correlation, which
remains constant in the same evolution range. With the implementation of an
optical $\sigma_{x}$ operation, the sudden transition from quantum to classical
revival regime is obtained and correlation echoes are formed. Our method can be
used to control the revival time of correlations, which would be important in
quantum memory.

material, traced by the emission in the optical [OI] lines. This neutral
material is most plausibly located within their dense, cool circumstellar
disks, which are formed from the (probably non-spherically symmetric) wind
material released by the star. Neither the formation mechanism nor the
resulting structure and internal kinematics of these disks (or disk-like
outflows) are well known. However, rapid rotation, lifting the material from
the equatorial surface region, seems to play a fundamental role. The B[e]
supergiant LHA 115-S 65 (S65) in the SMC is one of the two most rapidly
rotating B[e] stars known. Its almost edge-on orientation allows a detailed
kinematical study of its optically thin forbidden emission lines. With a focus
on the [OI] lines, we test the two plausible disk scenarios: the outflowing and
the Keplerian rotating disk. Based on high- and low-resolution optical spectra,
we investigate the density and temperature structure in those disk regions that
are traced by the [OI] emission to constrain the disk sizes and mass fluxes
needed to explain the observed [OI] line luminosities. In addition, we compute
the emerging line profiles expected for either an outflowing disk or a
Keplerian rotating disk, which can directly be compared to the observed
profiles. Both disk scenarios deliver reasonably good fits to the line
luminosities and profiles of the [OI] lines. Nevertheless, the Keplerian disk
model seems to be the more realistic one, because it also agrees with the
kinematics derived from the large number of additional lines in the spectrum.
As additional support for the presence of a high-density, gaseous disk, the
spectrum shows two very intense and clearly double-peaked [CaII] lines. We
discuss a possible disk-formation mechanism, and similarities between S65 and
the group of LBVs.

PACS map of the o-H2O 179 um transition obtained toward the young outflow
L1157. The 179 um map is compared with those of other important shock tracers,
and with previous single-pointing ISO, SWAS, and Odin water observations of the
same source that allow us to constrain the water abundance and total cooling.
Strong H2O peaks are localized on both shocked emission knots and the central
source position. The H2O 179 um emission is spatially correlated with emission
from H2 rotational lines, excited in shocks leading to a significant
enhancement of the water abundance. Water emission peaks along the outflow also
correlate with peaks of other shock-produced molecular species, such as SiO and
NH3. A strong H2O peak is also observed at the location of the proto-star,
where none of the other molecules have significant emission. The absolute 179
um intensity and its intensity ratio to the H2O 557 GHz line previously
observed with Odin/SWAS indicate that the water emission originates in warm
compact clumps, spatially unresolved by PACS, having a H2O abundance of the
order of 10^-4. This testifies that the clumps have been heated for a time long
enough to allow the conversion of almost all the available gas-phase oxygen
into water. The total water cooling is ~10^-1 Lo, about 40% of the cooling due
to H2 and 23% of the total energy released in shocks along the L1157 outflow.

requirement (the upper bound on $K$ for which the claim is true).

follows from the examination of consecutive WMAP data releases that the maximum
likelihood value of the quadrupole ratio $R$, which characterizes the amount of
relic gravitational waves, increases up to $R=0.264$, and the interval
separating this value from the point $R=0$ (the hypothesis of no gravitational
waves) increases up to a $2\sigma$ level. The primordial spectra of density
perturbations and gravitational waves remain blue in the relevant interval of
wavelengths, but the spectral indices increase up to $n_s =1.111$ and
$n_t=0.111$. Assuming that the maximum likelihood estimates of the perturbation
parameters that we found from WMAP7 data are the true values of the parameters,
we find that the signal-to-noise ratio $S/N$ for the detection of relic
gravitational waves by the Planck experiment increases up to $S/N=4.04$, even
under pessimistic assumptions with regard to residual foreground contamination
and instrumental noises. We comment on theoretical frameworks that, in the case
of success, will be accepted or decisively rejected by the Planck observations.

medium is modeled as a limiting case of a two-component lattice gas with
excluded volume constraint and one of the components fixed. In the
long-wavelength approximation, density relaxation of mobile particles is
governed by a diffusion process and interaction with a medium inhomogeneity
represented by a static component distribution. It is shown that density
relaxation can be locally accompanied by a density distribution compression. In
quasi one-dimensional case, the compression dynamics manifests itself in a
hopping-like motion of diffusing substance packet front position due to a
staged passing through inhomogeneity barriers and leads to a fragmentation of a
packet and retardation of its spreading. A root-mean-square displacement
reflects only an averaged packet front dynamics and becomes inappropriate as a
transport characteristic in this regime. In a stationary case mass transport
throughout a whole system may be directed from a boundary with low
concentration towards a boundary with that of high one. Implications of the
excluded volume constraint and particles distinguishability for these effects
are discussed.

mixed with the gas phase in protoplanetary disks, larger grains will be
partially decoupled and as a consequence have a different distribution from
that of the gas. This has ramifications for predictions of the observability of
protoplanetary disks, for which gas-only studies will provide an inaccurate
picture. Specifically, criteria for gap opening in the presence of a planet
have generally been studied for the gas phase, whereas the situation can be
quite different in the dust layer once grains reach mm sizes, which is what
will be observed by ALMA. Aims: We aim to investigate the formation and
structure of a planetary gap in the dust layer of a protoplanetary disk with an
embedded planet. Methods: We perform 3D, gas+dust SPH simulations of a
protoplanetary disk with a planet on a fixed circular orbit at 40 AU to study
the evolution of both the gas and dust distributions and densities in the disk.
We run a series of simulations in which the planet mass and the dust grain size
varies. Results: We show that the gap in the dust layer is more striking than
in the gas phase and that it is deeper and wider for more massive planets as
well as for larger grains. For a massive enough planet, we note that cm-sized
grains remain inside the gap in corotation and that their population in the
outer disk shows an asymmetric structure, a signature of disk-planet
interactions even for a circular planetary orbit, which should be observable
with ALMA.

criterion ensures the existence of ""stable"" local solutions that do no break
down too fast due to Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. It can be seen both as a
two-fluid generalization of the Rayleigh-Taylor criterion and as a nonlinear
version of the Kelvin stability condition. We show that gravity can control the
inertial effects of the shear up to frequencies that are high enough for the
surface tension to play a relevant role. This explains why surface tension is a
necessary condition for well-posedness while the (low frequency) main dynamics
of interfacial waves is unaffected by it. In order to derive a practical
version of this criterion, we work with a nondimensionalized version of the
equations and allow for the possibility of various asymptotic regimes, such as
the shallow water limit. This limit being singular, we have to derive a new
symbolic analysis of the Dirichlet-Neumann operator that includes an infinitely
smoothing ""tail"" accounting for the contribution of the bottom. We then
validate our criterion by comparison with experimental data in two important
settings: air-water interfaces and internal waves. The good agreement we

water-brine interfaces. We also show how to rigorously justify two-fluid

space-times are presented. Quasinormal modes for the scalar field have been
calculated in static and rotating cosmic cylinders. We found unstable modes in
the rotating cases. Rotating as well as static cosmic strings, i.e., without
regular interior solutions, do not display quasinormal modes for the scalar
field. We conclude presenting a conjecture relating closed timelike curves and

household epidemic models in which the infection response may be either mild or
severe, with the type of response also affecting the infectiousness of an
individual. Two different models are analysed. In the first model, the
infection status of an individual is predetermined, perhaps due to partial
immunity, and in the second, the infection status of an individual depends on
the infection status of its infector and on whether the individual was infected
by a within- or between-household contact. The first scenario may be modelled
using a multitype household epidemic model, and the second scenario by a model
we denote by the infector-dependent-severity household epidemic model. Large
population results of the two models are derived, with the focus being on the
distribution of the total numbers of mild and severe cases in a typical
household, of any given size, in the event that the epidemic becomes
established. The aim of the paper is to investigate whether it is possible to
determine which of the two underlying explanations is causing the varying
response when given final size household outbreak data containing mild and
severe cases. We conduct numerical studies which show that, given data on
sufficiently many households, it is generally possible to discriminate between
the two models by comparing the Kullback-Leibler divergence for the two fitted
models to these data.

(iii) at even higher supersaturation the dynamic arrest is due to the

formation of the (stable) smectic phase out of a supersaturated isotropic state
is strongly suppressed by an isotropic-nematic spinodal instability that causes
huge spinodal-like orientation fluctuations with nematic clusters diverging in

  Journal",,"10.1088/0004-637X/718/1/105",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We show that we can obtain a good fit to the present day stellar mass
functions (MFs) of a large sample of young and old Galactic clusters in the
range 0.1 - 10 Msolar with a tapered power law distribution function with an
exponential truncation of the form dN/dm \propto m^alpha [1 -
exp-(m/m_c)^beta]. The average value of the power-law index alpha is -2, that
of beta is 2.5, whereas the characteristic mass m_c is in the range 0.1 - 0.8
Msolar and does not seem to vary in any systematic way with the present cluster
parameters such as metal abundance, total cluster mass or central
concentration. However, m_c shows a remarkable correlation with the dynamical
age of the cluster, namely m_c/Msolar ~ 0.15 + 0.5 tau_dyn^0.75, where tau_dyn
is the dynamical age taken as the ratio of cluster age and dissolution time.
The small scatter seen around this correlation is consistent with the
uncertainties on the estimated value of tau_dyn. We attribute the observed
trend to the onset of mass segregation via two-body relaxation in a tidal
environment, causing the preferential loss of low-mass stars from the cluster
and hence a drift of the characteristic mass m_c towards higher values. If
dynamical evolution is indeed at the origin of the observed trend, it would
seem plausible that high-concentration globular clusters, now with median m_c ~
0.33 Msolar, were born with a stellar MF very similar to that measured today in
the youngest Galactic clusters and with a value of m_c ~ 0.15 Msolar. This
hypothesis is consistent with the absence of a turn-over in the MF of the
Galactic bulge down to the observational limit at ~0.2 Msolar and, if correct,
it would carry the implication that the characteristic mass is not set by the
thermal Jeans mass of the cloud.

split trees include for example binary search trees, $m$-ary search trees,
quadtrees, median of $(2k+1)$-trees, simplex trees, tries and digital search
trees. More precisely: We introduce the use of renewal theory in the studies of
split trees, and use this theory to prove several results about split trees. A
split tree of cardinality $n$ is constructed by distributing $n$ ""balls"" (which
often represent ""key numbers"") in a subset of vertices of an infinite tree. One
of our main results is to give a relation between the deterministic number of
balls $n$ and the random number of vertices $N$. Devroye has found a central
limit law for the depth of the last inserted ball so that most vertices are
close to $\frac{\ln n}{\mu}+\mathcal{O}\Big(\sqrt{\ln n}\Big)$, where $\mu$ is
some constant depending on the type of split tree; we sharpen this result by
finding an upper bound for the expected number of vertices with depths
$\geq\frac{\ln n}{\mu}+\ln^{0.5+\epsilon} n$ or depths $\leq\frac{\ln
n}{\mu}+\ln^{0.5+\epsilon} n$ for any choice of $\epsilon>0$. We also find the
first asymptotic of the variances of the depths of the balls in the tree.

conventional or micro-strip line (MS) ferromagnetic resonance (FMR). Their
behavior is described assuming a magnetic energy density showing twofold and
fourfold in-plane anisotropies with some misalignment between their principal
directions. For all the samples, the easy axis of the fourfold anisotropy is
parallel to the c-axis of the substrate while the direction of the twofold
anisotropy easy axis varies from sample to sample and seems to be strongly
influenced by the growth conditions. Its direction is most probably monitored
by the slight unavoidable angle of miscut the Al2O3 substrate. The twofold
in-plane anisotropy field is almost temperature independent, in contrast with
the fourfold field which is a decreasing function of the temperature. Finally,
we study the frequency dependence of the observed line-width of the resonant

submillimetric surface representation accuracy, directly exploitable within a
commercial FE software.
