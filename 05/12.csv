mean-field theory for the Hubbard model by means of a self-consistent
perturbation expansion around the atomic limit. While the lowest order, known
as the non-crossing approximation (NCA), is reliable only when the interaction
U is much larger than the bandwidth, low-order corrections to the NCA turn out
to be sufficient to reproduce numerically exact Monte Carlo results in a wide
parameter range that covers the insulating phase and the metal-insulator
crossover regime at not too low temperatures. As an application of the
perturbative strong-coupling impurity solver we investigate the response of the
double occupancy in the Mott insulating phase of the Hubbard model to a
dynamical change of the interaction or the hopping, a technique which has been
used as a probe of the Mott insulating state in ultracold fermionic gases.

formation. We adopt a galactic evolution model, in which the star formation
process inside the virialized dark halo at given redshift can be achieved. In
this paper, the gamma-ray burst(GRB) host galaxies are assumed to be the
star-forming galaxies within the small dark halos. The star formation
rates(SFRs) in the host galaxies of LGRBs at different redshifts have been
derived from our model with the galactic evolutionary time about a few times of
$10^7$ yr and the dark halo mass of about $5\times 10^{11}M_\odot$. The related
stellar masses, luminosities and metallicities of these hosts are estimated as
well. We further calculate the X-ray and optical absorption of GRB afterglow
emission. From our model calculation, at higher redshift, the SFR of host
galaxy is larger, the absorption in X-ray band and optical band of GRB
afterglow is stronger, in the condition that the dust and metal components are
released locally, surrounding the GRB environment. These model predictions are
compared with the {\it Swift} and other observational data. At lower redshift
$z<1$, as the merger and interaction of some host galaxies are involved, one
monolithic physical process is not sufficient to fully explain all kinds of

Stimulated by this conjecture we have taken up a more complete study of the
spin correlations in this compound with neutron scattering methods on a powder
sample characterized with high-resolution neutron diffraction and the
temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility and specific heat. We have
found that the frustrated near neighbor magnetic correlations involve not only
the kagome planes but concern the full Co sub-lattice as evidenced by the
analysis of the wavevector-dependence of the short range order. We conclude
from our results that the magnetic moments are located on the Co sub-lattice as
a whole and that correlations extend beyond the two-dimensional kagome planes.
We identify intriguing dynamical properties, observing high-frequency
fluctuations with a lorentzian line-width {\Gamma} <= 20 meV at ambient
temperature. On cooling a low-frequency (~ 1 meV) dynamical component develops
alongside the high-frequency fluctuations, which eventually becomes static at
temperatures below T ~ 50 K. The high-frequency response with an overall
line-width of ~ 10 meV prevails at T <= 2 K coincident with a fully elastic
short-range ordered contribution.

inherent inaccuracy, in particular the Gibbs phenomenon, is being intensively
investigated during the last decades. Several nonlinear reconstruction methods
have been proposed, and it is by now well-established that the ""classical""
convergence order can be completely restored up to the discontinuities. Still,
the maximal accuracy of determining the positions of these discontinuities
remains an open question. In this paper we prove that the locations of the
jumps (and subsequently the pointwise values of the function) can be
reconstructed with at least ""half the classical accuracy"". In particular, we
develop a constructive approximation procedure which, given the first $k$
Fourier coefficients of a piecewise-$C^{2d+1}$ function, recovers the locations
of the jumps with accuracy $\sim k^{-(d+2)}$, and the values of the function
between the jumps with accuracy $\sim k^{-(d+1)}$ (similar estimates are
obtained for the associated jump magnitudes). A key ingredient of the algorithm
is to start with the case of a single discontinuity, where a modified version
of one of the existing algebraic methods (due to K.Eckhoff) may be applied. It
turns out that the additional orders of smoothness produce a highly correlated
error terms in the Fourier coefficients, which eventually cancel out in the
corresponding algebraic equations. To handle more than one jump, we propose to
apply a localization procedure via a convolution in the Fourier domain.

higher temperatures, at least in early-type spirals with relatively large

stars form out of a mix of pristine gas and ejecta of the first generation of
asymptotic giant branch stars. We first study the constraints imposed by the
spectroscopic data of SG stars in globular clusters on the chemical properties
of the asymptotic and super asymptotic giant branch ejecta. With a simple
one-zone chemical model, we then explore the formation of the SG population
abundance patterns focussing our attention on the Na-O, Al-Mg anticorrelations
and on the helium distribution function. We carry out a survey of models and
explore the dependence of the final SG chemical properties on the key
parameters affecting the gas dynamics and the SG formation process. Finally, we
use our chemical evolution framework to build specific models for NGC 2808 and
M4, two Galactic globular clusters which show different patterns in the Na-O
and Mg-Al anticorrelation and have different helium distributions. We find that
the amount of pristine gas involved in the formation of SG stars is a key
parameter to fit the observed O-Na and Mg-Al patterns. The helium distribution
function for these models is in general good agreement with the observed one.
Our models, by shedding light on the role of different parameters and their
interplay in determining the final SG chemical properties, illustrate the basic
ingredients, constraints and problems encountered in this self-enrichment
scenario which must be addressed by more sophisticated chemical and
hydrodynamic simulations.

there can be no ordering of infinite range, a superfluid phase is predicted for
a Bose liquid. The stabilization of phase in this superfluid regime is achieved
by the formation of bound vortex-antivortex pairs. It is believed that several
different systems share this common behaviour, when the parameter describing
their ordered state has two degrees of freedom, and the theory has been tested
for some of them. However, there has been no direct experimental observation of
the phase stabilization mechanism by a bound pair. Here we present an
experimental technique that can identify a single vortex-antivortex pair in a
two-dimensional exciton polariton condensate. The pair is generated by the
inhomogeneous pumping spot profile, and is revealed in the time-integrated
phase maps acquired using Michelson interferometry, which show that the
condensate phase is only locally disturbed. Numerical modelling based on open
dissipative Gross-Pitaevskii equation suggests that the pair evolution is quite
different in this non-equilibrium system compared to atomic condensates. Our
results demonstrate that the exciton polariton condensate is a unique system

power-spectrum of the ionospheric electron-density fluctuations based on
radio-interferometric observations by a two-dimensional planar array. The
method is valid to first-order Born approximation and might be applicable to
correct observed visibilities for phase variations due to the imprint of the
full three-dimensional ionosphere. It is shown that not the ionospheric
electron density distribution is the primary structure to model in
interferometry, but its autocorrelation function or equivalent its
power-spectrum. An exact mathematical expression is derived that provides the
three dimensional power-spectrum of the ionospheric electron-density
fluctuations directly from a rescaled scattered intensity field and an incident
intensity field convolved with a complex unit phasor that depends on the w-term
and is defined on the full sky pupil plane. In the limit of a small field of
view, the method reduces to the single phase screen approximation. Tomographic
self-calibration can become important in high-dynamic range observations at low
radio frequencies with wide-field antenna interferometers, because a
three-dimensional ionosphere causes a spatially varying convolution of the sky,
whereas a single phase screen results in a spatially invariant convolution. A
thick ionosphere can therefore not be approximated by a single phase screen
without introducing errors in the calibration process. By applying a Radon
projection and the Fourier projection-slice theorem, it is shown that the
phase-screen approach in three dimensions is identical to the tomographic
method. Finally we suggest that residual speckle can cause a diffuse intensity
halo around sources, due to uncorrectable ionospheric phase fluctuations in the
short integrations, which could pose a fundamental limit on the dynamic range
in long-integration images.

effects of a high-energy fundamental theory in terms of the low-energy degrees
of freedom. This process has been well established in mapping the fundamental
theory of QCD in terms of the hadronic degrees of freedom, which allows for
quantitative connections and predictions between hardronic observables. A more
direct approach to performing the non-perturbative QCD calculations is through
lattice QCD. These computationally intensive calculations approximate continuum
physics with a discretized lattice to extract hadronic phenomena from first
principles. However, as in any approximation, there are multiple systematic
errors between lattice QCD calculation and actual hardronic phenomena. To
account for these systematic effects in terms of hadronic interactions,
effective field theory proves to be useful. However, the fundamental theory of
interest here is lattice QCD, as opposed to the usual continuum QCD. In this
work, the basics of this process are outlined, and multiple original
calculations are presented: effective field theory for anisotropic lattices,
I=2 $\pi\pi$ scattering for isotropic, anisotropic, and twisted mass lattices.
Additionally, a usage of effective field theories and the employment of an
isospin chemical potential on the lattice is proposed to extract several
computationally difficult scattering parameters. Lastly, recently proposed
local, chiral lattice actions are analyzed in the framework of effective field

of this fixed point for the nonanalytic behavior of $\chi$. An immediate
consequence of SOI-induced anisotropy in the nonanalytic behavior of $\chi$ is
a possible instability of a second-order ferromagnetic quantum phase transition

Beyond the wealth of atomic and molecular lines detected in the high-resolution
spectra obtained with the FTS of SPIRE in the Orion Bar, one emission line is
found to lie at the position of the fundamental rotational transition of CH+ as
measured precisely in the laboratory (Pearson & Drouion 2006). This coincidence
suggests that it is the first detection of the fundamental rotational
transition of CH+. This claim is strengthened by the observation of the lambda
doublet transitions arising from its relative, CH, which are also observed in
the same spectrum. The broad spectral coverage of the SPIRE FTS allows for the
simultaneous measurement of these closely related chemically species, under the
same observing conditions. The importance of these lines are discussed and a
comparison with results obtained from models of the Photon Dominated Region
(PDR) of Orion are presented. The CH+ line also appears in absorption in the
spectra of the two galactic compact HII regions G29.96-0.02 and G32.80+0.19,

making use of polarization information. Since the orientation of a galaxy's
polarized emission is both unaffected by lensing and is related to the galaxy's
intrinsic orientation, it effectively provides information on the unlensed
galaxy position angle. We derive a new weak lensing estimator which exploits
this effect and makes full use of both the observed galaxy shapes and the
estimates of the intrinsic position angles as provided by polarization. Our
method has the potential to both reduce the effects of shot noise, and to
reduce to negligible levels, in a model-independent way, all effects of
intrinsic galaxy alignments. We test our technique on simulated weak lensing
skies, including an intrinsic alignment contaminant consistent with recent
observations, in three overlapping redshift bins. Adopting a standard weak
lensing analysis and ignoring intrinsic alignments results in biases of 5-10%
in the recovered power spectra and cosmological parameters. Applying our new
estimator to one tenth the number of galaxies used for the standard case, we
recover both power spectra and the input cosmology with similar precision as
compared to the standard case and with negligible residual bias, even in the
presence of a substantial (astrophysical) scatter in the relationship between
the observed orientation of the polarized emission and the intrinsic
orientation. Assuming a reasonable polarization fraction for star-forming
galaxies, and no cosmological conspiracy in the relationship between
polarization direction and intrinsic morphology, our estimator should prove a
valuable tool for weak lensing analyses of forthcoming radio surveys, in
particular, deep wide field surveys with e-MERLIN, MeerKAT and ASKAP and
ultimately, definitive radio lensing surveys with the SKA.

Background (CMB) temperature and polarization anisotropy can tightly constrain
many cosmological models and parameters. However, accurate measurements can
only be realized in practice provided all major systematic effects have been
taken into account. Beam asymmetry, coupled with the scan strategy, is a major
source of systematic error in scanning CMB experiments such as Planck, the
focus of our current interest. We envision Monte Carlo methods to rigorously
study and account for the systematic effect of beams in CMB analysis. Toward
that goal, we have developed a fast pixel space convolution method that can
simulate sky maps observed by a scanning instrument, taking into account real
beam shapes and scan strategy. The essence is to pre-compute the ""effective
beams"" using a computer code, ""Fast Effective Beam Convolution in Pixel space""
(FEBeCoP), that we have developed for the Planck mission. The code computes
effective beams given the focal plane beam characteristics of the Planck
instrument and the full history of actual satellite pointing, and performs very
fast convolution of sky signals using the effective beams. In this paper, we
describe the algorithm and the computational scheme that has been implemented.
We also outline a few applications of the effective beams in the precision
analysis of Planck data, for characterizing the CMB anisotropy and for
detecting and measuring properties of point sources.

described by their masses and spins. This theorem can be tested observationally
by measuring (at least) three different multipole moments of the spacetimes of
black holes. In this paper, we analyze images of black holes within a framework
that allows us to calculate observables in the electromagnetic spectrum as a
function of the mass, spin, and, independently, the quadrupole moment of a
black hole. We show that a deviation of the quadrupole moment from the expected
Kerr value leads to images of black holes that are either prolate or oblate
depending on the sign and magnitude of the deviation. In addition, there is a
ring-like structure around the black-hole shadow with a diameter of about 10
black-hole masses that is substantially brighter than the image of the
underlying accretion flow and that is independent of the astrophysical details
of accretion flow models. We show that the shape of this ring depends directly
on the mass, spin, and quadrupole moment of the black hole and can be used for
an independent measurement of all three parameters. In particular, we
demonstrate that this ring is highly circular for a Kerr black hole with a spin
a<0.9M, independent of the observer's inclination, but becomes elliptical and
asymmetric if the no-hair theorem is violated. Near-future very-long baseline
interferometric observations of Sgr A* will image this ring and may allow for

modeling of these data, we estimate the properties of the blastwave and the
circumstellar environment. We find evidence for a freely-expanding and
non-relativistic explosion with an average blastwave velocity, v~0.2c, and a
total internal energy for the radio emitting material of E ~ 2 x 10^46 erg
assuming equipartition of energy between electrons and magnetic fields
(epsilon_e=epsilon_B=0.1). The temporal and spectral evolution of the radio
emission points to a stellar wind-blown environment shaped by a steady
progenitor mass loss rate of Mdot ~ 6 x 10^-7 solar masses per year (wind
velocity, v_w=10^3 km/s). These parameters are fully consistent with those
inferred for other SNe Ibc and are in line with the expectations for an
ordinary, homologous SN explosion. Our results are at odds with those of Paragi
et al. (2010) who recently reported evidence for a relativistic blastwave in SN
2007gr based on their claim that the radio emission was resolved away in a low
signal-to-noise Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observation. Here we
show that the exotic physical scenarios required to explain the claimed
relativistic velocity -- extreme departures from equipartition and/or a highly
collimated outflow -- are excluded by our detailed Very Large Array radio
observations. Moreover, we present an independent analysis of the VLBI data and
propose that a modest loss of phase coherence provides a more natural
explanation for the apparent flux density loss which is evident on both short
and long baselines. We conclude that SN 2007gr is an ordinary Type Ibc
supernova.

understanding of uncertain data. However, incorporating probabilities into the
semantics of incomplete databases has posed many challenges, forcing systems to
sacrifice modeling power, scalability, or restrict the class of relational
algebra formula under which they are closed. We propose an alternative approach
where the underlying relational database always represents a single world, and
an external factor graph encodes a distribution over possible worlds; Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inference is then used to recover this uncertainty to
a desired level of fidelity. Our approach allows the efficient evaluation of
arbitrary queries over probabilistic databases with arbitrary dependencies
expressed by graphical models with structure that changes during inference.
MCMC sampling provides efficiency by hypothesizing {\em modifications} to
possible worlds rather than generating entire worlds from scratch. Queries are
then run over the portions of the world that change, avoiding the onerous cost
of running full queries over each sampled world. A significant innovation of
this work is the connection between MCMC sampling and materialized view
maintenance techniques: we find empirically that using view maintenance
techniques is several orders of magnitude faster than naively querying each
sampled world. We also demonstrate our system's ability to answer relational
queries with aggregation, and demonstrate additional scalability through the
use of parallelization.

the role of any intracluster medium cannot be neglected. High foreground
extinction can lead to situations where young stellar objects (YSOs) appear to
be in earlier evolutionary stages than they actually are, particularly when
using simple criteria like spectral indices. To address this issue, we have
assembled detailed SED characterizations of a sample of 56 Spitzer-identified
candidate YSOs in the clusters NGC 2264 and IC 348. For these, we use spectra
obtained with the Infrared Spectrograph onboard the Spitzer Space Telescope and
ancillary multi-wavelength photometry. The primary aim is twofold: 1) to
discuss the role of spectral features, particularly those due to ices and
silicates, in determining a YSO's evolutionary stage, and 2) to perform
comprehensive modeling of spectral energy distributions (SEDs) enhanced by the
IRS data. The SEDs consist of ancillary optical-to-submillimeter
multi-wavelength data as well as an accurate description of the 9.7 micron
silicate feature and of the mid-infrared continuum derived from line-free parts
of the IRS spectra. We find that using this approach, we can distinguish
genuine protostars in the cluster from T Tauri stars masquerading as protostars
due to external foreground extinction. Our results underline the importance of
photometric data in the far-infrared/submillimeter wavelength range, at
sufficiently high angular resolution to more accurately classify cluster

the interactions that affect the different subgroups conforming the whole. To
this end, we employ the widespread example of coagulation kinetics, and
characterize which interaction types lead to consensus formation and which do
not, as well as the corresponding different macroscopic patterns. The crucial
technical point is extending the usual one species coagulation dynamics to the
two species one. This is achieved by means of introducing explicitly solvable
kernels which have a clear physical meaning. The corresponding solutions are
calculated in the long time limit, in which consensus may or may not be
reached. The lack of consensus is characterized by means of scaling limits of
the solutions. The possible applications of our results to some topics in which
consensus reaching is fundamental, like collective animal motion and opinion
spreading dynamics, are also outlined.

$n$-vertex $r$-chromatic graph with maximum degree at most $\Delta$ which has
bandwidth at most $\beta n$, then any graph $G$ on $n$ vertices with minimum
degree at least $(1 - 1/r + \gamma)n$ contains a copy of $H$ for large enough

bipartite $H$, this answers an open question of B\""{o}ttcher, Kohayakawa, and
Taraz. It appears that for non-bipartite $H$ the direct extension is not
possible, and one needs in addition that some vertices of $H$ have independent

The technique is based only on geometry and determines H0 in one step,
independent of standard candles and the extragalactic distance ladder. In Paper
I we presented a VLBI map of the maser emission from the Seyfert 2 galaxy UGC
3789. The map reveals an edge-on, sub-parsec disk in Keplerian rotation,
analogous to the megamaser disk in NGC 4258. Here we present 3.2 years of
monthly GBT observations of the megamaser disk in UGC 3789. We use these
observations to measure the centripetal accelerations of both the systemic and
high-velocity maser components. The measured accelerations suggest that maser
emission lines near the systemic velocity originate on the front side of the
accretion disk, primarily from segments of two narrow rings. Adopting a
two-ring model for the systemic features, we determine the angular-diameter
distance to UGC 3789 to be 49.9 +/- 7.0 Mpc. This is the most accurate
geometric distance yet obtained to a galaxy in the Hubble flow. Based on this
distance, we determine H0 = 69 +/- 11 km/s/Mpc. We also measure the mass of the
central black hole to be 1.09 x 10^7 solar masses +/- 14%. With additional
observations the uncertainty in the distance to this galaxy can be reduced to

or a quasispecies (QS). A common formalism to approach QS is the
replicator-mutator equation (RME). However, a problem with the RME is how to
quantify the interaction coefficients between viral variants. Here, this is
addressed by adopting an ecological perspective and resorting to the niche
theory of competing communities, which assumes that the utilization of
resources primarily determines ecological segregation between competing
individuals (the different viral variants that constitute the QS). Using this
novel combination of RME plus the ecological concept of niche overlapping, for
describing QS, we explore the population distributions of viral variants that
emerge, as well as the corresponding dynamics. We observe that the population
distribution requires very long transients both to A) reach equilibrium and B)
to show a clear dominating master sequence. Based on different independent and
recent experimental evidence, we find that when some cooperation or
facilitation between variants is included in appropriate doses we can solve
both A) and B). We show that a useful quantity to calibrate the degree of
cooperation is the Shannon entropy. Therefore, in order to get a typical
quasispecies profile, it seems that pure competition is not enough. Rather,
some degree of cooperation among viral variants is needed. This has several
biological implications that might contribute to shed light on the mechanisms
operating in QS dynamics and to understand the QS as a whole entity.

distribution $\pi$, let $T_n>0$ denote a hitting time for $[n]^c$, and let
$X_n=X(T_n)$. Around 2005 Guy Louchard popularized a conjecture that, for $n\to

stationarily distributed on $[n]^c$, and that $X_n$ and $T_n$ are almost

chains with $p(n) \to 0$ however slowly, and with
$\sup_{i,j}\,\|p(i,\cdot)-p(j,\cdot)\|_{TV}<1$, we show that Louchard's
conjecture is indeed true even for the hits of an arbitrary $S_n\subset\Bbb N$
with $\pi(S_n)\to 0$. More precisely, a sequence of $k$ consecutive hit
locations paired with the time elapsed since a previous hit (for the first hit,
since the starting moment) is approximated, within a total variation distance
of order $k\,\sup_ip(i,S_n)$, by a $k$-long sequence of independent copies of
$(\ell_n,t_n)$, where $\ell_n= \text{Geometric}\,(\pi(S_n))$, $t_n$ is
distributed stationarily on $S_n$, and $\ell_n$ is independent of $t_n$. The
two conditions are easily met by the Markov chains that arose in Louchard's
studies as likely sharp approximations of two random compositions of a large
integer $\nu$, a column-convex animal (cca) composition and a Carlitz (C)

the parts of the random compositions. Combining the two approximations in a
tandem, we are able to determine the limiting distributions of $\mu=o(\ln\nu)$

in general six degrees of freedom. We find that two of these physical modes
obey the same dispersion relation as the one for a non-relativistic de Broglie
wave. This means that spacetime is either highly unstable or its fluctuations
undergo a scale-dependent super-luminal propagation. Two other modes correspond
to the degrees of freedom of the perfect fluid, and propagate with the sound
speed of such a fluid. The remaining two modes correspond to the entropy and
temperature perturbations of the perfect fluid, and completely decouple from
the other modes for a barotropic equation of state. We then provide a concise
condition on f(R,G) theories, that both f(R) and R+f(G) do fulfill, to avoid
the de Broglie type dispersion relation. For the vector type perturbation, we

circumnuclear ring at wavelengths that probe the peak (i.e. lambda ~ 100
micron) of the dust spectral energy distribution. The ring dominates the
far-infrared (far-IR) emission from the galaxy - the high angular resolution of
PACS allows us to isolate the ring's contribution and we find it is responsible
for 75, 60 and 55% of the total flux of NGC 1097 at 70, 100 and 160 micron,
respectively. We compare the far-IR structure of the ring to what is seen at
other wavelengths and identify a sequence of far-IR bright knots that
correspond to those seen in radio and mid-IR images. The mid- and far-IR band
ratios in the ring vary by less than +/- 20% azimuthally, indicating modest
variation in the radiation field heating the dust on ~ 600 pc scales. We
explore various explanations for the azimuthal uniformity in the far-IR colors
of the ring including a lack of well-defined age gradients in the young stellar
cluster population, a dominant contribution to the far-IR emission from dust
heated by older (> 10 Myr) stars and/or a quick smoothing of local enhancements
in dust temperature due to the short orbital period of the ring. Finally, we
improve previous limits on the far-IR flux from the inner ~ 600 pc of NGC 1097

high-mass cores with embedded low- to intermediate-mass objects, to finally
high-mass protostellar objects. Methods: Herschel far-infrared PACS and SPIRE
observations are combined with existing data at longer and shorter wavelengths
to characterize the spectral and physical evolution of massive star-forming
regions. Results: The new Herschel images spectacularly show the evolution of
the youngest and cold high-mass star-forming regions from mid-infrared shadows
on the Wien-side of the spectral energy distribution (SED), via structures
almost lost in the background emission around 100mum, to strong emission
sources at the Rayleigh-Jeans tail. Fits of the SEDs for four exemplary regions
covering evolutionary stages from high-mass starless cores to high-mass
protostellar objects reveal that the youngest regions can be fitted by
single-component black-bodies with temperatures on the order of 17K. More
evolved regions show mid-infrared excess emission from an additional warmer
component, which however barely contributes to the total luminosities for the
youngest regions. Exceptionally low values of the ratio between bolometric and
submm luminosity additionally support the youth of the infrared-dark sources.
Conclusions: The Herschel observations reveal the spectral and physical
properties of young high-mass star-forming regions in detail. The data clearly
outline the evolutionary sequence in the images and SEDs. Future work on larger
samples as well as incorporating full radiative transfer calculations will
characterize the physical nature at the onset of massive star formation in even

this case depending if the niche width of the species $\sigma$ is above or
below a threshold $\sigma_c$, which for large n coincides with 2/n, there are
two different regimes. For $\sigma > sigma_c$ the lumpy pattern emerges
directly from the dominant eigenvector of the competition matrix because its

slowing down as $\sigma$ is approached from above. We also find that the number

contains pulsars detectable in blind radio searches which have spin-down
luminosities Edot > 10^{34} erg/s. We analyse the fraction of the
gamma-ray-selected Sample G which have detectable radio pulses and the fraction
of the radio-selected Sample R which have detectable gamma-ray pulses. Twenty
of our 35 Sample G pulsars have already observed radio pulses. This rules out
low-altitude polar-cap beaming models if, as is currently believed, gamma-ray
beams are generated in the outer magnetosphere and are very wide. We further
find that, for the highest-Edot pulsars, the radio and gamma-ray beams have
comparable beaming factors, i.e., the beams cover similar regions of the sky as
the star rotates. For lower-Edot gamma-ray emitting pulsars, the radio beams
have about half of the gamma-ray sky coverage. These results suggest that, for
high-Edot young and millisecond pulsars, the radio emission originates in wide
beams from regions high in the pulsar magnetosphere, probably close to the
null-charge surface and to the gamma-ray emitting regions. Furthermore, it
suggests that for these high-Edot pulsars, as in the gamma-ray case, features
in the radio profile represent caustics in the emission beam pattern.

framework of QCD factorization (QCDF) for $K_h= K,K^*,K_0^*(1430)$ and naive
factorization for $K_h=K_2^*(1430)$. There are three distinct types of penguin
contributions: (i) $b\to sq\bar q\to s\eta_{q}$, (ii) $b\to ss\bar s\to
s\eta_s$, and (iii) $b\to s q\bar q\to q \bar K_h$, where $\eta_q=(u\bar
u+d\bar d)/\sqrt{2}$ and $\eta_s=s\bar s$. $B\to K^{(*)}\eta^{(')}$ decays are
dominated by type-II and type-III penguin contributions. The interference,
constructive for $K\eta'$ and $K^*\eta$ and destructive for $K\eta$ and
$K^*\eta'$, between type-II and type-III diagrams explains the pattern of
$\Gamma(B\to K\eta')\gg\Gamma(B\to K\eta)$ and $\Gamma(B\to
K^*\eta')\ll\Gamma(B\to K^*\eta)$. Within QCDF, the observed large rate of the
$K\eta'$ mode can be naturally explained without invoking flavor-singlet
contributions or something exotic. The decay pattern for $B\to
K_0^*(1430)\eta^{(')}$ decays depends on whether the scalar meson $K_0^*(1430)$
is an excited state of $\kappa$ or a lowest-lying $P$-wave $q\bar q$ state.
Hence, the experimental measurements of $B\to K_0^*(1430)\eta^{(')}$ can be
used to explore the quark structure of $K_0^*(1430)$. If $K_0^*(1430)$ is a
low-lying $q\bar q$ bound state, we find that $K_0^*\eta$ has a rate slightly
larger than $K_0^*\eta'$ owing to the fact that the $\eta$-$\eta'$ mixing angle
in the $\eta_q,\eta_s$ flavor basis is less than $45^\circ$, in agreement with

that the symmetric-side channel -- which distributes quantum information
symmetrically between the receiver and the environment -- is a good candidate
for a notion of public quantum communication in entanglement distillation and
quantum error correction.
  This connection is partially motivated by [Brand\~ao and Oppenheim,
arXiv:1004.3328], where it was found that if a sender would like to communicate
a secret message to a receiver through an insecure quantum channel using a
shared quantum state as a key, then the insecure quantum channel is only ever
used to simulate a symmetric-side channel, and can always be replaced by it
without altering the optimal rate. Here we further show, in complete analogy to
the role of public classical communication, that assistance by a symmetric-side
channel makes equal the distillable entanglement, the recently-introduced
mutual independence, and a generalization of the latter, which quantifies the
extent to which one of the parties can perform quantum privacy amplification.
  Symmetric-side channels, and the closely related erasure channel, have been
recently harnessed to provide examples of superactivation of the quantum
channel capacity. Our findings give new insight into this non-additivity of the
channel capacity and its relation to quantum privacy. In particular, we show
that single-copy superactivation protocols with the erasure channel, which
encompasses all examples of non-additivity of the quantum capacity found to
date, can be understood as a conversion of mutual independence into distillable
entanglement.

discovered approx 180 s 3%-6% dips in the photometry. Subsequent radial
velocity measurements of the primary white dwarf from the Keck telescope found
variations with a semi-amplitude K_1 = 271 +/- 3 km/s, and confirmed the dips
as eclipses caused by an orbiting WD with a mass M_2 = 0.648-0.771 M_sun for
M_1 = 0.1-0.2 M_sun. We detect both the primary and secondary eclipses during
the P_orb = 5.64 hr orbit and measure the secondary's brightness to be 3.5% +/-
0.3% of the primary at SDSS-g'. Assuming that the secondary follows the
mass-radius relation of a cold C/O WD and including the effects of microlensing
in the binary, the primary eclipse yields a primary radius of R_1 = 0.043-0.039
R_sun for M_1 = 0.1-0.2 M_sun, consistent with the theoretically expected
values for a helium core WD with a thick, stably burning hydrogen envelope.
Though nearby (at approx 150 pc), the gravitational wave strain from NLTT 11748

nonequilibrium pattern formation; it has been extensively investigated for
biological and chemical processes. Turing pattern formation should furthermore
be possible in network-organized systems, such as cellular networks in
morphogenesis and ecological metapopulations with dispersal connections between
habitats, but investigations have so far been restricted to regular lattices
and small networks. Here we report the first systematic investigation of Turing
patterns in large random networks, which reveals their striking difference from
the known classical behavior. In such networks, Turing instability leads to
spontaneous differentiation of the network nodes into activator-rich and
activator-low groups, but ordered periodic structures never develop. Only a
subset of nodes having close degrees (numbers of links) undergoes
differentiation, with its characteristic degree obeying a simple general law.
Strong nonlinear restructuring process leads to multiple coexisting states and
hysteresis effects. The final stationary patterns can be well understood in the
framework of the mean-field approximation for network dynamics.

the V = 10.8 mag F8 dwarf GSC 2792-01700, with a period P = 2.775960 +-
0.000003 d, transit epoch Tc = 2455027.59293 +- 0.00031 (BJD), and transit
duration 0.1276 +- 0.0013 d. The host star has a mass of 1.22 +- 0.04 Msun,
radius of 1.24 +- 0.05 Rsun, effective temperature 6158 +-80 K, and metallicity
[Fe/H] = +0.17 +- 0.08. The planetary companion has a mass of 4.193 +- 0.094
MJ, and radius of 1.289 +- 0.066 RJ yielding a mean density of 2.42 +- 0.35

we find that HAT-P-16b is consistent with a 1 Gyr H/He-dominated gas giant

objective formed by a sum of local (possibly nonsmooth) convex functions using
only local computation and communication. It arises in various application
domains, including distributed tracking and localization, multi-agent
co-ordination, estimation in sensor networks, and large-scale optimization in
machine learning. We develop and analyze distributed algorithms based on dual
averaging of subgradients, and we provide sharp bounds on their convergence
rates as a function of the network size and topology. Our method of analysis
allows for a clear separation between the convergence of the optimization
algorithm itself and the effects of communication constraints arising from the

required by our algorithm scales inversely in the spectral gap of the network.
The sharpness of this prediction is confirmed both by theoretical lower bounds

deterministic optimization and communication, as well as problems with

of $1/T_1$, $R \equiv (1/T_{1})_{H \parallel ab}/(1/T_{1})_{H \parallel c}$ in

ascribable to the presence of the local stripe correlations with $Q = (\pi, 0)$

infinite nuclear matter within the $(\sigma-\omega)$ model at all densities
$n_{\mathrm{B}}$ and different proton-neutron asymmetry $\eta\equiv(N-Z)/A$. We
have presented an analytical expression for the compression modulus and found
that nuclear matter ceases to saturate at $\eta$ slightly larger than $0.8$.
Afterward, we have developed an analytical method to determine the strong
coupling constants from the EoS for isospin symmetric nuclear matter, which
allow us to reproduce all the saturation properties with high accuracy. For
various values of the nucleon effective mass and the compression modulus, we
have found that the quartic self-coupling constant $G_4$ is negative, or
positive and very large. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that it is possible
(a) to investigate the EoS in terms of $n_{\mathrm{B}}$ and $\eta$; and (b) to
reproduce all the known saturation properties without $G_4$. We have thus
concluded that the latter is not necessary in the $(\sigma-\omega)$ model.

Programme aimed at understanding the physical and chemical structure of young
stellar objects (YSOs) with a focus on water and related species. The low-mass
protostar HH 46 was observed with the Photodetector Array Camera and
Spectrometer (PACS) on the Herschel Space Observatory to measure emission in
H2O, CO, OH, [OI], and [CII] lines located between 63 and 186 um. The
excitation and spatial distribution of emission can disentangle the different
heating mechanisms of YSOs, with better spatial resolution and sensitivity than
previously possible. Far-IR line emission is detected at the position of the
protostar and along the outflow axis. The OH emission is concentrated at the
central position, CO emission is bright at the central position and along the
outflow, and H2O emission is concentrated in the outflow. In addition, [OI]
emission is seen in low-velocity gas, assumed to be related to the envelope,
and is also seen shifted up to 170 km/s in both the red- and blue-shifted jets.
Envelope models are constructed based on previous observational constraints.
They indicate that passive heating of a spherical envelope by the protostellar
luminosity cannot explain the high-excitation molecular gas detected with PACS,
including CO lines with upper levels at >2500 K above the ground state.
Instead, warm CO and H2O emission is probably produced in the walls of an
outflow-carved cavity in the envelope, which are heated by UV photons and
non-dissociative C-type shocks. The bright OH and [OI] emission is attributed
to J-type shocks in dense gas close to the protostar. In the scenario described
here, the combined cooling by far-IR lines within the central spatial pixel is
estimated to be 2 \times 10-2 L_sun, with 60-80% attributed to J- and C-type
shocks produced by interactions between the jet and the envelope.

magnetization is investigated in terms of two vector fields ${\bf M}_{1i}$ and
${\bf M}_{2i}$ which identify the local orientation of the magnetization of the
two groups of $f$ electrons. Renormalized spin-wave theory, which accounts for
the magnon-magnon interaction, and its extension are developed to describe two
ferromagnetic phases in the system: low temperature large moment phase
$0<T<T^{*}$ (FM2), where all $5f$ electrons contribute the ordered
ferromagnetic moment, and high temperature low-moment phase $T^{*}<T<T_C$
(FM1), where $f$ electrons are partially ordered. Both phases are strictly
ferromagnetic in accordance with experiment. The magnetization as a function of
temperature is calculated. The anomalous temperature dependence of the ordered
moment, known from the experiments with $UGe_2$, is very well reproduced
theoretically. Below $T_x$ ($T^*$ in the present paper) the ferromagnetic
moment increases in an anomalous way. The new understanding of the anomalous
$FM2\to FM1$ transition, as a result of the magnetic order of two well
separated groups of $f$ electrons, yields the key to an understanding of the
ferromagnetism and transport properties in these compounds.

behaviour, including what is now termed rheological chaos, at moderate values
of the shear rate. Such chaos associated with rheological response occurs in
regimes where the Reynolds number is very small. It must thus arise as a
consequence of the coupling of the flow to internal structural variables
describing the local state of the fluid. We propose a coupled map lattice (CML)
model for such complex spatio-temporal behaviour in a passively sheared nematic
liquid crystal, using local maps constructed so as to accurately describe the
spatially homogeneous case. Such local maps are coupled diffusively to nearest
and next nearest neighbours to mimic the effects of spatial gradients in the
underlying equations of motion. We investigate the dynamical steady states
obtained as parameters in the map and the strength of the spatial coupling are
varied, studying local temporal properties at a single site as well as
spatio-temporal features of the extended system. Our methods reproduce the full
range of spatio-temporal behaviour seen in earlier one-dimensional studies
based on partial differential equations. We report results for both the one and
two-dimensional cases, showing that spatial coupling favours uniform or
periodically time-varying states, as intuitively expected. We demonstrate and
characterize regimes of spatio-temporal intermittency out of which chaos
develops. Our work suggests that such simplified lattice representations of the
spatio-temporal dynamics of complex fluids under shear may provide useful
insights as well as fast and numerically tractable alternatives to continuum
representations.

matter under the action of gravity and a chameleon scalar field. We show that
the spherical collapse model is modified by the presence of a chameleon field.
In particular, we find that even though the chameleon effects can be
potentially large at small scales, for a large enough initial size of the
inhomogeneity the collapsing region possesses a thin shell that shields the
modification of gravity induced by the chameleon field, recovering the standard
gravity results. We analyse the behaviour of a collapsing shell in a
cosmological setting in the presence of a thin shell and find that, in contrast
to the usual case, the critical density for collapse depends on the initial
comoving size of the inhomogeneity.

an infinite tower of families of algebraic curves. For the big cell the
subbundle $TB_{W_\varnothing}$ represents the tower of families of normal
rational (Veronese) curves of all degrees. For $W_1$ such tautological
subbundle is the family of coordinate rings for elliptic curves. For higher

Two methods of regularization of singular curves contained in

developed in terms of a geometric property called the vanishing gap condition.
This condition is shown to be equivalent to eigenvalue convergence and
intermediate between two different discrete variants of Friedrichs estimates.
Next we turn to a more practical means of checking these properties. We
introduce a notion of compatible operator and show how the previous conditions
are equivalent to the existence of such operators with various convergence
properties. In particular the vanishing gap condition is shown to be equivalent
to the existence of compatible operators satisfying an Aubin-Nitsche estimate.
Finally we give examples demonstrating that the implications not shown to be

recorded by the EUVI instrument onboard STEREO-B on January 17, 2010. The main
arguments that the observed structure is the wave dome (and not the CME) are:
a) the spherical form and sharpness of the dome's outer edge and the erupting
CME loops observed inside the dome; b) the low-coronal wave signatures above
the limb perfectly connecting to the on-disk signatures of the wave; c) the
lateral extent of the expanding dome which is much larger than that of the
coronal dimming; d) the associated high-frequency type II burst indicating
shock formation low in the corona. The velocity of the upward expansion of the
wave dome ($v \sim 650$ km s$^{-1}$) is larger than that of the lateral
expansion of the wave ($v \sim 280$ km s$^{-1}$), indicating that the upward
dome expansion is driven all the time, and thus depends on the CME speed,
whereas in the lateral direction it is freely propagating after the CME lateral
expansion stops. We also examine the evolution of the perturbation
characteristics: First the perturbation profile steepens and the amplitude
increases. Thereafter, the amplitude decreases with r$^{-2.5 \pm 0.3}$, the
width broadens, and the integral below the perturbation remains constant. Our
findings are consistent with the spherical expansion and decay of a weakly
shocked fast-mode MHD wave.

diversity schemes. However, in mobile environments, the outage probability does
not completely describe the behavior of cooperative diversity schemes since the
mobility of the involved nodes introduces variations in the channel gains. As a
result, the capacity outage events are correlated in time and second-order
statistical parameters of the achievable information-theoretic capacity such as
the average capacity outage rate (AOR) and the average capacity outage duration
(AOD) are required to obtain a more complete description of the properties of
cooperative diversity protocols. In this paper, assuming slow Rayleigh fading,
we derive exact expressions for the AOR and the AOD of three well-known
cooperative diversity protocols: variable-gain amplify-and-forward,
decode-and-forward, and selection decode-and-forward relaying. Furthermore, we
develop asymptotically tight high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) approximations,
which offer important insights into the influence of various system and channel
parameters on the AOR and AOD. In particular, we show that on a
double-logarithmic scale, similar to the outage probability, the AOR
asymptotically decays with the SNR with a slope that depends on the diversity
gain of the cooperative protocol, whereas the AOD asymptotically decays with a
slope of -1/2 independent of the diversity gain.

(systems of) integrable partial difference equations. We apply the staircase
method to a variety of equations, including the Korteweg-De Vries equation, the
five-point Bruschi-Calogero-Droghei equation, the QD-algorithm, and the
Boussinesq system. We show that, in all these cases, if the staircase method
provides r integrals for an n-dimensional mapping, with 2r<n, then one can
introduce q<= 2r variables, which reduce the dimension of the mapping from n to
q. These dimension-reducing variables are obtained as joint invariants of
k-symmetries of the mappings. Our results support the idea that often the
staircase method provides sufficiently many integrals for the periodic
reductions of integrable lattice equations to be completely integrable. We also
study reductions on other quad-graphs than the regular 2D lattice, and we prove
linear growth of the multi-valuedness of iterates of high-dimensional
correspondences obtained as reductions of the QD-algorithm.

of the disturbing huge precessions induced by the first even zonal harmonic
coefficient J_2 of the multipolar expansion of the Newtonian part of the
terrestrial gravitational potential by means of suitably designed linear
combinations of the nodes \Omega of more than one spacecraft. Actually, such a

2 cm in the semimajor axes a and 0.5 milliarcseconds in the inclinations I of
LAGEOS and LAGEOS II, entering the expression of the coefficient c_1 of the

10^-8. It gives an imperfectly canceled J_2 signal of 10.8 milliarcseconds per
year corresponding to 23% of the Lense-Thirring signature. Uncertainties of the
order of 10-30 microarcseconds in the inclinations yield \delta c_1=7.9 10^-9

II-LARES combination with coefficients k_1 and k_2, the same uncertainties in a

\delta k_2=2 10^-9; they imply a residual J_2 combined precession of 14.7

Uncertainties in the inclinations at about 10 microarcseconds level give \delta
k_1=5 10^-9, \delta k_2 = 2 10^-9; the uncanceled J_2 effect is 7.9

dissipative and electrically charged distributions in General Relativity. We
evolve nonadiabatic distributions assuming an equation of state that accounts
for the anisotropy induced by the electric charge. Dissipation is described by
streaming out or diffusion approximations. We match the interior solution, in
noncomoving coordinates, with the Vaidya-Reissner-Nordstr\""om exterior
solution. Two models are considered: i) a Schwarzschild-like shell in the
diffusion limit; ii) a Schwarzschild-like interior in the free streaming limit.
These toy models tell us something about the nature of the dissipative and
electrically charged collapse. Diffusion stabilizes the gravitational collapse
producing a spherical shell whose contraction is halted in a short
characteristic hydrodynamic time. The streaming out radiation provides a more
efficient mechanism for emission of energy, redistributing the electric charge
on the whole sphere, while the distribution collapses indefinitely with a
longer hydrodynamic time scale.

we investigate coronal dimmings at the onset of small-scale eruptions. In CMEs
they are believed to indicate the opening up of the coronal magnetic fields at
the start of the eruption. Aims: It is to determine whether coronal dimming
seen in small-scale eruptions starts before or after chromospheric plasma
ejection. Methods: One STEREO spacecraft obtained high cadence, 75 s, images in
the He II 304A channel, and the other simultaneous images in the Fe IX/FeX 171A
channel. We concentrate on two well-positioned chromospheric eruptions that
occurred at disk center in the 171A images, and on the limb in 304A. One was in
the quiet Sun and the other was in an equatorial coronal hole. We compare the
timing of chromospheric eruption seen in the 304A limb images with the
brightenings and dimmings seen on disk in the 171A images. Further we use
off-limb images of the low frequency 171A power to infer the coronal structure
near the eruptions. Results: In both the quiet Sun and the coronal hole
eruption, on disk 171A dimming was seen before the chromospheric eruption, and
in both cases it extends beyond the site of the chromospheric eruption. The
quiet Sun eruption occurred on the outer edge of the enclosing magnetic field
of a prominence and may be related to a small disruption of the prominence just
before the 171A dimming. Conclusions: These small-scale chromospheric eruptions
started with a dimming in coronal emission just like their larger counterparts.
We therefore suggest that a fundamental step in triggering them was the removal
of overlying coronal field.

masses considering different implementations of a model in which black holes
only grow via mergers. We demonstrate how merger driven growth affects the
correlations between black hole mass and host bulge mass. The simple case of an
initially log-normal distributed scatter in black hole and bulge masses
combined with random merging within the galaxy population results in a
decreasing scatter with merging generation/number as predicted by the
Central-limit theorem. In general we find that the decrease in scatter {\sigma}
is well approximated by {\sigma}merg(m) = {\sigma}ini \times (m + 1)^(-a/2)
with a = 0.42 for a range of mean number of mergers m < 50. For a large mean
number of mergers (m > 100) we find a convergence to a = 0.61. This is valid
for a wide range of different initial distributions, refill-scenarios or merger
mass-ratios. Growth scenarios based on halo merger trees of a (100 Mpc)^3 dark
matter LambdaCDM-simulation show a similar behaviour with a scatter decrease of
a = 0.30 with typical number of mergers m < 50 consistent with random merging
(best matching model: a = 0.34). Assuming a present day scatter of 0.3 dex in
black hole mass and a mean number of mergers not exceeding m = 50 our results
imply a scatter of 0.6 dex at z = 3 and thus a possible scenario in which
overmassive (and undermassive) black holes at high redshift are a consequence
of a larger intrinsic scatter in black hole mass. A simple toy model connecting
the growth of black holes to the growth of LambdaCDM dark matter halos via
mergers, neglecting any contribution from accretion, yields a consistent M\cdot
-MBulge relation at z = 0 - if we assume the correct initial relation.

to determine properties that characterize networks closely related to $N$ and
possibly more complicated than trees but lacking the full complexity of $N$.
  A connected surjective digraph map (CSD) is a map $f$ from one network $N$ to
another network $M$ such that every arc is either collapsed to a single vertex
or is taken to an arc, such that $f$ is surjective, and such that the inverse
image of a vertex is always connected. CSD maps are shown to behave well under
composition. It is proved that if there is a CSD map from $N$ to $M$, then
there is a way to lift an undirected version of $M$ into $N$, often with added
resolution. A CSD map from $N$ to $M$ puts strong constraints on $N$.
  In general, it may be useful to study classes of networks such that, for any
$N$, there exists a CSD map from $N$ to some standard member of that class.

energy transfer and entanglement generation. The donor and the acceptor couple
to two independent heat baths with diagonal couplings that do not dissipate the
energy of the non-coupling dimer. Special attention is paid to the effect on
single-excitation energy transfer and entanglement generation of the energy
detuning between the donor and the acceptor and the temperatures of the two
heat baths. It is found that, the probability for single-excitation energy
transfer largely depends on the energy detuning in the low temperature limit.
Concretely, the positive and negative energy detunings can increase and
decrease the probability at the steady state, respectively. In the high
temperature limit, however, the effect of the energy detuning on the
probability is neglectably small. We also find that the probability is
neglectably dependent on the bath temperature difference of the two heat baths.
In addition, it is found that quantum entanglement can be generated in the
process of coherent energy transfer. As the bath temperature increases, the
generated steady state entanglement decreases. For a given bath temperature,
the steady-state entanglement decreases with the increasing of the absolute
value of the energy detuning.

properties. Despite a strong potential for numerous technical applications, the
conditions under which quasicrystals form are still poorly understood.
Currently, it is not clear why most quasicrystals hold 5- or 10-fold symmetry
but no single example with 7 or 9-fold symmetry has ever been observed. Here we
report on geometrical constraints which impede the formation of quasicrystals
with certain symmetries in a colloidal model system. Experimentally, colloidal
quasicrystals are created by subjecting micron-sized particles to
two-dimensional quasiperiodic potential landscapes created by n=5 or seven
laser beams. Our results clearly demonstrate that quasicrystalline order is
much easier established for n = 5 compared to n = 7. With increasing laser
intensity we observe that the colloids first adopt quasiperiodic order at local
areas which then laterally grow until an extended quasicrystalline layer forms.
As nucleation sites where quasiperiodicity originates, we identify highly
symmetric motifs in the laser pattern. We find that their density strongly
varies with n and surprisingly is smallest exactly for those quasicrystalline
symmetries which have never been observed in atomic systems. Since such high
symmetry motifs also exist in atomic quasicrystals where they act as
preferential adsorption sites, this suggests that it is indeed the deficiency
of such motifs which accounts for the absence of materials with e.g. 7-fold
symmetry.

There are some reference value for optimizing the distribution of IPv4 address

Analysis demonstrates that the analytic method based on uniform distributions

an approximate method to predict the growth dynamics of the individual nodes,

investigating the mechanism leading to the X-ray emission detected in
protostellar jets and at constraining the physical parameters that describe the
jet/ambient interaction by comparing our model predictions with observations.
We perform 2D axisymmetric hydrodynamic simulations of the interaction between
a supersonic jet and the ambient. The jet is described as a train of plasma
blobs randomly ejected by the stellar source along the jet axis. We explore the
parameter space by varying the ejection rate, the initial jet Mach number, and
the initial density contrast between the ambient and the jet. We synthesized
from the model the X-ray emission as it would be observed with the current
X-ray telescopes. The mutual interactions among the ejected blobs and of the
blobs with the ambient medium lead to complex X-ray emitting structures within
the jet: irregular chains of knots; isolated knots with measurable proper
motion; apparently stationary knots; reverse shocks. The predicted X-ray
luminosity strongly depends on the ejection rate and on the initial density
contrast between the ambient and the jet, with a weaker dependence on the jet
Mach number. Our model represents the first attempt to describe the X-ray
properties of all the X-ray emitting protostellar jets. The comparison between
our model predictions and the observations can provide a useful diagnostic tool
necessary for a proper interpretation of the observations. In particular, we
suggest that the observable quantities derived from the spectral analysis of
X-ray observations can be used to constrain the ejection rate, a parameter
explored in our model that is not measurable by current observations.

order to determine, in detail for each star, whether there is circumstellar
disk material situated in sufficient proximity to the stellar surface for
interaction with the large magnetic loops inferred from the observed X-ray
flares. Our spectral energy distributions span the wavelength range 0.3-8 um
(plus 24 um for some stars), allowing us to constrain the presence of dusty
circumstellar material out to >10 AU from the stellar surface in most cases.
For 24 of the 32 stars in our sample the available data are sufficient to
constrain the location of the inner edge of the dusty disks. Six of these (25%)
have spectral energy distributions consistent with inner disks within reach of
the observed magnetic loops. Another four stars may have gas disks interior to
the dust disk and extending within reach of the magnetic loops, but we cannot
confirm this with the available data. The remaining 14 stars (58%) appear to
have no significant disk material within reach of the large flaring loops.
Thus, up to ~40% of the sample stars exhibit energetic X-ray flares that
possibly arise from a magnetic star-disk interaction, and the remainder are
evidently associated with extremely large, free-standing magnetic loops
anchored only to the stellar surface.

particular, we consider operators that can be interpreted as distances, areas,
3- and 4-volumes. The Minkowski distance operator between two independent
events is shown to have pure Lebesgue spectrum with infinite multiplicity. The
Euclidean distance operator is shown to have spectrum bounded below by a
constant of the order of the Planck length. The corresponding statement is
proved also for both the space-space and space-time area operators, as well as
for the Euclidean length of the vector representing the 3-volume operators.
However, the space 3-volume operator (the time component of that vector) is
shown to have spectrum equal to the whole complex plane. All these operators
are normal, while the distance operators are also selfadjoint. The Lorentz
invariant spacetime volume operator, representing the 4- volume spanned by five

finite distance (of the order of the fourth power of the Planck length) away

Moreover, according to a classical two-agent algorithm, this result holds not
only in the quantum world, but also in the macro world.

are associated with a stationary time series, which avoids direct estimation of
the asymptotic variances. Unlike the existing tuning-parameter-dependent
approaches, our method has the attractive convenience of being free of choosing
any user-chosen number or smoothing parameter. The interval is constructed on
the basis of an asymptotically distribution-free self-normalized statistic, in
which the normalizing matrix is computed using recursive estimates. Under mild
conditions, we establish the theoretical validity of our method for a broad
class of statistics that are functionals of the empirical distribution of fixed
or growing dimension. From a practical point of view, our method is
conceptually simple, easy to implement and can be readily used by the
practitioner. Monte-Carlo simulations are conducted to compare the finite
sample performance of the new method with those delivered by the normal
approximation and the block bootstrap approach.

observed soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs) and anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs). In
this work we investigate the possibility that SGRs and AXPs might be
observational evidence for a magnetic phase separation in magnetars. We study
magnetic domain formation as a new mechanism for SGRs and AXPs in which
magnetar-matter separates into two phases containing different flux densities.
We identify the parameter space in matter density and magnetic field strength
at which there is an instability for magnetic domain formation. We conclude
that such instabilities will likely occur in the deep outer crust for the
magnetic Baym, Pethick, and Sutherland (BPS) model and in the inner crust and
core for magnetars described in relativistic Hartree theory. Moreover, we
estimate that the energy released by the onset of this instability is
comparable with the energy emitted by SGRs.

capable of distinguishing M degenerate modes by running M different simulations

requires solving a small eigenvalue problem. Realistic calculations for an

method for realistic modeling scenarios and to illustrate the complexities of
the computational validation process. The method is found to be able to extract
the frequencies with error that is less than a part in 10^5. The corrected
experimental and computed values differ by about one parts in 10^$, which is
accounted for (in largest part) by machining errors. The extraction of

physicists an understanding of potential cavity performance as it depends on
