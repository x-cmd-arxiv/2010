of the braid group. The problem had remained open for many years. The fact that
the Lawrence-Krammer representation of the braid group is reducible for some
complex values of its two parameters is now known, as well as the complete
description of these values under some restrictions on one of the parameters.
It is also known that when the representation is reducible, the action on a
proper invariant subspace is an Iwahori-Hecke algebra action. In this paper, we
prove a theorem of classification for the invariant subspaces of the
Lawrence-Krammer space. We classify the proper invariant subspaces in terms of
Specht modules. We fully describe them in terms of dimension and spanning

we show that the same hidden conformal symmetry is also held. The temperatures

We give applications to matrix multipication; sparse matrix reconstruction;
and, \math{\ell_2} regression. For a matrix \math{\matA\in\R^{m\times d}} which
represents \math{m} points in \math{d\ll m} dimensions, all of these tasks can
be achieved in \math{O(md^2)} via the singular value decomposition (SVD). For
appropriate row-sampling probabilities (which typically depend on the norms of
the rows of the \math{m\times d} left singular matrix of \math{\matA} (the
\emph{leverage scores}), we give row-sampling algorithms with linear (up to
polylog factors) dependence on the stable rank of \math{\matA}. This result is
achieved through the application of non-commutative Bernstein bounds.
  We then give, to our knowledge, the first algorithms for computing
approximations to the appropriate row-sampling probabilities without going
through the SVD of \math{\matA}. Thus, these are the first \math{o(md^2)}
algorithms for row-sampling based approximations to the matrix algorithms which
use leverage scores as the sampling probabilities. The techniques we use to
approximate sampling according to the leverage scores uses some powerful recent
results in the theory of random projections for embedding, and may be of some
independent interest. We confess that one may perform all these matrix tasks
more efficiently using these same random projection methods, however the
resulting algorithms are in terms of a small number of linear combinations of
all the rows. In many applications, the actual rows of \math{\matA} have some
physical meaning and so methods based on a small number of the actual rows are
of interest.

black hole candidate XTE J1752-223 by Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE). The
new source appeared on the X-ray sky on October 21 2009 and was active for
almost 8 months. Phenomenologically, the source exhibited the
low-hard/high-soft spectral state bi-modality and the variability evolution
during the state transition that matches standard behavior expected from a
stellar mass black hole binary. We model the energy spectrum throughout the
outburst using a generic Comptonization model assuming that part of the input
soft radiation in the form of a black body spectrum gets reprocessed in the
Comptonizing medium. We follow the evolution of fractional root-mean-square
(RMS) variability in the RXTE/PCA energy band with the source spectral state
and conclude that broad band variability is strongly correlated with the source
hardness (or Comptonized fraction). We follow changes in the energy
distribution of rms variability during the low-hard state and the state
transition and find further evidence that variable emission is strongly
concentrated in the power-law spectral component. We discuss the implication of
our results to the Comptonization regimes during different spectral states.
Correlations of spectral and variability properties provide measurements of the
BH mass and distance to the source. The spectral-timing correlation scaling
technique applied to the RXTE observation during the hard-to-soft state
transition indicates a mass of the BH in XTE J1752-223 between 8 and 11 solar
masses and a distance to the source about 3.5 kiloparsec.

detachment pulse power. In the absence of the detachment pulse, undulating
pendant droplets are formed at the end of a properly fed metal wire due to the
impact of the primary laser pulse that induces melting. Eventually, these
droplets detach, i.e. overcome the surface tension, because of their increasing
mass. We show that this spontaneous dripping is deterministically chaotic by
means of a positive largest Lyapunov exponent and a negative divergence. In the
presence of the detachment pulse, however, the generation of droplets is
fastened depending on the pulse power. At high powers, the spontaneity of
dripping is completely overshadowed by the impact of the detachment pulse.
Still, amplitude chaos can be detected, which similarly as the spontaneous
dripping, is characterized by a positive largest Lyapunov exponent and a
negative divergence, thus indicating that the observed dynamics is
deterministically chaotic with an attractor as solution in the phase space. In
the intermediate regime, i.e. for low and medium detachment pulse powers, the
two chaotic states compete for supremacy, yielding an intermittent
period-doubling to amplitude chaos transition, which we characterize by means
of recurrence plots and their properties. Altogether, the transition from
spontaneous to triggered laser droplet generation is characterized by a
chaos-to-chaos transition with an intermediate dynamically nonstationary phase
in-between. Since metal droplets can be used in various industrial
applications, we hope that the accurate determination of the dynamical
properties underlying their formation will facilitate their use and guide
future attempts at mathematical modeling.

short scales normally defined as being lower than the conventional read-out

stars, black holes and white dwarfs, surfaces with extreme magnetic
reconnection phenomena, as well as with planetary scale objects through
transits and occultations. HTRA is the only way to make a major step forward in
our understanding of several important astrophysical and physical processes;
these include the extreme gravity conditions around neutron stars and stable
orbits around stellar mass black holes. Transits, involving fast timing, can
give vital information on the size of, and satellites around exoplanets. In the
realm of fundamental physics very interesting applications lie in the regime of
ultra-high time resolution, where quantum-physical phenomena, currently studied
in laboratory physics, may be explored. HTRA science covers the full gamut of
observational optical/IR astronomy from asteroids to {\gamma}-rays bursts,
contributing to four out of six of AstroNet's fundamental challenges described
in their Science Vision for European Astronomy. Giving the European-Extremely
Large Telescope (E-ELT) an HTRA capability is therefore importance. We suggest
that there are three possibilities for HTRA and E-ELT. These are, firstly
giving the E-ELT first light engineering camera an HTRA science capability.
Secondly, to include a small HTRA instrument within another instrument.
Finally, to have separate fibre feeds to a dedicated HTRA instrument. In this
case a small number of fibres could be positioned and would provide a flexible
and low cost means to have an HTRA capability. By the time of E-ELT first
light, there should be a number of significant developments in fast detector
arrays, in particular in the infra-red (IR) region.

scattering is therefore required to obtain meaningful results. One powerful
technique for achieving this, known as 3D cross-correlation, uses two
simultaneous light scattering experiments performed at the same scattering
vector on the same sample volume in order to extract only the single scattering
information common to both. Here we present a significant improvement to this
method in which the two scattering experiments are temporally separated by
modulating the incident laser beams and gating the detector outputs at
frequencies exceeding the timescale of the system dynamics. This robust
modulation scheme eliminates cross-talk between the two beam- detector pairs
and leads to a four-fold improvement in the cross-correlation intercept. We
measure the dynamic and angular-dependent scattering intensity of turbid
colloidal suspensions and exploit the improved signal quality of the modulated
3D cross-correlation DLS and SLS techniques.

operational significance a criterion has to produce guarantee on the attacker's
probability of correctly estimating some portion of K from her measurement, in
particular her maximum probability of identifying the whole K. We distinguish
between the raw security of K when the attacker just gets at K before it is
used in a cryptographic context and its composition security when the attacker
may gain further information during its actual use to help getting at K. We
compare both of these securities of K to those obtainable from conventional key
expansion with a symmetric key cipher. It is pointed out that a common belief
in the superior security of a quantum generated K is based on an incorrect
interpretation of d which cannot be true, and the security significance of d is
uncertain. Generally, the QKD key K has no composition security guarantee and
its raw security guarantee from concrete protocols is worse than that of
conventional ciphers. Furthermore, for both raw and composition security there
is an exponential catch up problem that would make it difficult to
quantitatively improve the security of K in a realistic protocol. Some possible
ways to deal with the situation are suggested.

roughly equal to elliptic flow in most central collisions. We also explore the

sample of LAEs with resolved Lyman alpha emission. Comparing the light
distribution between the rest-frame ultraviolet continuum and narrowband

While our data do not support a positional offset between the Lyman alpha and
rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) continuum emission, the half-light radii in two out
of the three galaxies are significantly larger in Lyman alpha than in the
rest-frame UV continuum. This result is confirmed when comparing object sizes
in a stack of all objects in both bands. Additionally, the narrowband flux
detected with HST is significantly less than observed in similar filters from
the ground. These results together imply that the Lyman alpha emission is not
strictly confined to its indigenous star-forming regions. Rather, the Lyman
alpha emission is more extended, with the missing HST flux likely existing in a
diffuse outer halo. This suggests that the radiative transfer of Lyman alpha
photons in high-redshift LAEs is complicated, with the interstellar-medium

have lost its outer layers before exploding, requiring that it be a white

of the host galaxy show no signs of individual massive stars, star clusters, or
H II regions at the SN position or anywhere else, making a Wolf-Rayet
progenitor unlikely. Late-time spectroscopy of SN 2008ge show strong [Fe II]
lines with large velocity widths compared to other members of this class at
similar epochs. These previously unseen features indicate that a significant
amount of the SN ejecta is Fe (presumably the result of radioactive decay of

X-shooter spectrographs, we detect H2, HD and CO molecules in absorption with
log N(H2,HD,CO)=(19.21,14.48,14.17). The overall metallicity of the system is
super-solar ([Zn/H]=+0.34) and iron is highly depleted ([Fe/Zn]=-1.39),
revealing metal-rich and dusty gas. The strongest H2 component does not
coincide with the centre of the HI absorption. This implies that the molecular
fraction in this component, f=2N(H2)/(2N(H2)+N(H^0)), is larger than the mean
molecular fraction <f>=1/4 in the system. This is supported by the detection of
Cl^0 associated with this H2-component having N(Cl^0)/N(Cl^+)>0.4. Since Cl^0
is tied up to H2 by charge exchange reactions, this means that the molecular
fraction in this component is not far from unity. The size of the molecular
cloud is probably smaller than 1pc. Both the CO/H2=10^-5 and CO/C^0~1 ratios
for f>0.24 indicate that the cloud classifies as translucent, i.e., a regime
where carbon is found both in atomic and molecular form. The corresponding
extinction, Av=0.14, albeit lower than the definition of a translucent
sightline (based on extinction properties), is high for the observed H^0 column
density. This means that intervening clouds with similar local properties but
with larger column densities could be missed by current magnitude-limited QSO
surveys. The excitation of CO is dominated by radiative interaction with the
Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR) and we derive Tex(CO)=10.5+0.8-0.6

effect of non-local primordial non-Gaussianity on the clustering of halos. Our
approach is applicable to arbitrary primordial bispectra. We show that the
scale-dependence of halo clustering predicted in the peak-background split
(PBS) agrees with that of the local-biasing model on large scales. On smaller
scales, k >~ 0.01 h/Mpc, the predictions diverge, a consequence of the
assumption of separation of scales in the peak-background split. Even on large
scales, PBS and local biasing do not generally agree on the amplitude of the
effect outside of the high-peak limit. The scale dependence of the biasing -
the effect that provides strong constraints to the local-model bispectrum - is
far weaker for the equilateral and self-ordering-scalar-field models of
non-Gaussianity. The bias scale dependence for the orthogonal and folded models
is weaker than in the local model (~ 1/k), but likely still strong enough to be
constraining. We show that departures from scale-invariance of the primordial
power spectrum may lead to order-unity corrections, relative to predictions
made assuming scale-invariance - to the non-Gaussian bias in some of these
non-local models for non-Gaussianity. An Appendix shows that a non-local model
can produce the local-model bispectrum, a mathematical curiosity we uncovered

particles within a mass shell are torqued throughout evolution. We choose
torque parameters motivated by tidal torque theory and N-body simulations and
analytically calculate the structure of the halo in different radial regimes.
We find that angular momentum plays an important role in determining the
density profile at small radii. For cosmological initial conditions, the
density profile on small scales is set by the time rate of change of the
angular momentum of particles as well as the halo mass. On intermediate scales,
however, $\rho\propto r^{-2}$, while $\rho\propto r^{-3}$ close to the virial

displaced versions of the continuum, this alternative approach fits the light
curves directly using a damped random walk model and aligns them to recover the
time lag and its statistical confidence limits. We introduce the mathematical
formalism of this approach and demonstrate its ability to cope with some of the

lags. We confirm the general results from the traditional cross-correlation
methods, with a few exceptions. Our method, however, also supports a broad
range of extensions. In particular, it can simultaneously fit multiple lines
and continuum light curves which improves the lag estimate for the lines and
provides estimates of the error correlations between them. Determining these
correlations is of particular importance for interpreting emission-line
velocity--delay maps. We can also include parameters for luminosity-dependent

observer. Therefore, even completely transparent planets will display a very
similar signal to that of a standard transit, i.e., that of an opaque planet.
We provide analytical expression for the amount of additional light deflected

outer layers of their atmospheres and lowers their cooling rates. ""Inflated""
hot Jupiters, i.e., those with anomalously large transit radii, require
additional sources of heat or suppressed cooling. We consider the effect of
forced turbulent mixing in the radiative layer, which could be driven by
atmospheric circulation or by another mechanism. Due to stable stratification
in the atmosphere, forced turbulence drives a downward flux of heat. Weak
turbulent mixing slows the cooling rate by this process, as if the planet was
irradiated more intensely. Stronger turbulent mixing buries heat into the
convective interior, provided the turbulence extends to the
radiative-convective boundary. This inflates the planet until a balance is
reached between the heat buried into and radiated from the interior. We also
include the direct injection of heat due to the dissipation of turbulence or
other effects. Such heating is already known to slow planetary cooling. We find
that dissipation also enhances heat burial from mixing by lowering the
threshold for turbulent mixing to drive heat into the interior. Strong
turbulent mixing of heavy molecular species such as TiO may be necessary to
explain stratospheric thermal inversions. We show that the amount of mixing
required to loft TiO may overinflate the planet by our mechanism. This possible
refutation of the TiO hypothesis deserves further study. Our inflation
mechanism requires a deep stratified layer that only exists when the absorbed
stellar flux greatly exceeds the intrinsic emitted flux. Thus it would be less
effective for more luminous brown dwarfs and for longer period gas giants,
including Jupiter and Saturn.

international initiative to test and compare different methods of photo-z
estimation. Two different test environments are set up, one (PHAT0) based on
simulations to test the basic functionality of the different photo-z codes, and
another one (PHAT1) based on data from the GOODS survey. The accuracy of the
different methods is expressed and ranked by the global photo-z bias, scatter,
and outlier rates. Most methods agree well on PHAT0 but produce photo-z
scatters that can differ by up to a factor of two even in this idealised case.
A larger spread in accuracy is found for PHAT1. Few methods benefit from the
addition of mid-IR photometry. Remaining biases and systematic effects can be
explained by shortcomings in the different template sets and the use of priors
on the one hand and an insufficient training set on the other hand. Scatters of
4-8% in Delta_z/(1+z) were obtained, consistent with other studies. However,
somewhat larger outlier rates (>7.5% with Delta_z/(1+z)>0.15; >4.5% after
cleaning) are found for all codes. There is a general trend that empirical
codes produce smaller biases than template-based codes. The systematic,
quantitative comparison of different photo-z codes presented here is a snapshot
of the current state-of-the-art of photo-z estimation and sets a standard for
the assessment of photo-z accuracy in the future. The rather large outlier
rates reported here for PHAT1 on real data should be investigated further since
they are most probably also present (and possibly hidden) in many other
studies. The test data sets are publicly available and can be used to compare
new methods to established ones and help in guiding future photo-z method
development. (abridged)

selected. For this purpose numerous heuristics have been proposed. Some of the
best of such heuristics exploit information about failures gathered throughout
search and recorded in the form of constraint weights, while others measure the
importance of variable assignments in reducing the search space. In this work
we experimentally evaluate the most recent and powerful variable ordering
heuristics, and new variants of them, over a wide range of benchmarks. Results
demonstrate that heuristics based on failures are in general more efficient.
Based on this, we then derive new revision ordering heuristics that exploit
recorded failures to efficiently order the propagation list when arc
consistency is maintained during search. Interestingly, in addition to reducing
the number of constraint checks and list operations, these heuristics are also
able to cut down the size of the explored search tree.

Although it has been shown that in theory the latter can be exponentially more
effective than the former, there is a lack of empirical evidence showing such
differences. To investigate this, we initially make an experimental comparison
of the two branching schemes over a wide range of benchmarks. Experimental
results verify the theoretical gap between d-way and 2-way branching as we move
from a simple variable ordering heuristic like dom to more sophisticated ones
like dom/ddeg. However, perhaps surprisingly, experiments also show that when
state-of-the-art variable ordering heuristics like dom/wdeg are used then d-way
can be clearly more efficient than 2-way branching in many cases. Motivated by
this observation, we develop two generic heuristics that can be applied at
certain points during search to decide whether 2-way branching or a restricted
version of 2-way branching, which is close to d-way branching, will be
followed. The application of these heuristics results in an adaptive branching
scheme. Experiments with instantiations of the two generic heuristics confirm
that search with adaptive branching outperforms search with a fixed branching
scheme on a wide range of problems.

astrophysical ice analogs is presented. This analysis aims to simulate the
chemical and the physicochemical interactions induced by heavy cosmic rays
inside dense and cold astrophysical environments such as molecular clouds or
protostellar clouds. The measurements were performed at the heavy ion
accelerator GANIL (Grand Accelerateur National d'Ions Lourds in Caen, France).
The gas samples were deposited onto a CsI substrate at 13 K. In-situ analysis
was performed by a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer at different
fluences. Radiolysis yields of the produced species were quantified. The
dissociation cross sections of pure H2O and CO2 ices are 1.1 and 1.9E-13 cm^2,
respectively. In the case of mixed H2O:CO2 (10:1) the dissociation cross
sections of both species are about 1E-13 cm^2. The measured sputtering yield of
pure CO2 ice is 2.2E4 molec/ion. After a fluence of 2-3E12 ions/cm^2 the CO2/CO
ratio becomes roughly constant (~0.1), independent of the of initial CO2/H2O
ratio. A similar behavior is observed for the H2O2/H2O ratio which stabilizes
at 0.01, independent of the initial H2O column density or relative abundance.

presence of a supersonic turbulent velocity field. Here we carry out the first
systematic numerical study of such passive scalar mixing in isothermal
supersonic turbulence. Our simulations show that the ratio of the scalar mixing
timescale, $\tau_{\rm c}$, to the flow dynamical time, $\tau_{\rm dyn}$
(defined as the flow driving scale divided by the rms velocity), increases with
the Mach number, $M$, for $M \lsim3$, and becomes essentially constant for $M
\gsim3.$ This trend suggests that compressible modes are less efficient in
enhancing mixing than solenoidal modes. However, since the majority of kinetic
energy is contained in solenoidal modes at all Mach numbers, the overall change
in $\tau_{\rm c}/\tau_{\rm dyn}$ is less than 20\% over the range $1 \lsim M
\lsim 6$. At all Mach numbers, if pollutants are injected at around the flow
driving scale, $\tau_{\rm c}$ is close to $\tau_{\rm dyn}.$ This suggests that
scalar mixing is driven by a cascade process similar to that of the velocity
field. The dependence of $\tau_{\rm c}$ on the length scale at which pollutants
are injected into flow is also consistent with this cascade picture. Similar
behavior is found for the variance decay timescales for scalars without
continuing sources. Extension of the scalar cascade picture to the supersonic
regime predicts a relation between the scaling exponents of the velocity and
the scalar structure functions, with the scalar structure function becoming
flatter as the velocity scaling steepens with Mach number. Our measurements of
the volume-weighted velocity and scalar structure functions confirm this
relation for $M\lsim 2,$ but show discrepancies at $M \gsim 3$.

excellent tool to describe the character of nonlinear n-dimensional flows by n

shortcomings: (a) The local exponents fail to indicate the origin of
instability where trajectories start to diverge. Instead, their time evolution
contains a much stronger chaos than the trajectories, which is only eliminated
by integrating over a long time. Therefore, shorter time intervals cannot be
characterized correctly, which would be essential to analyse changes of chaotic
character as in transients. (b) Moreover, although Oseledec uses an n
dimensional sphere around a point x to be transformed into an n dimensional
ellipse in first order, this local ellipse has yet not been evaluated. The aim
of this contribution is to eliminate these two shortcomings. Problem (a)
disappears if the Oseledec method is replaced by a frame with a 'constraint' as
performed by Rateitschak and Klages (RK) [Phys. Rev. E 65 036209 (2002)]. The
reasons why this method is better will be illustrated by comparing different

consecutive Poincare points will be evaluated. The local problems (b) will be
solved analytically by introducing the symmetric 'Jacobian deformation
ellipsoid' and its orthogonal submatrix, which enable to search in the full
phase space for extreme local separation exponents. These are close to the RK
exponents but need no time integration of the RK frame. Finally, four sets of
local exponents are compared: Oseledec frame, RK frame, Jacobian deformation
ellipsoid and its orthogonal submatrix.

on which cavity is excited, either the atomic dynamics is frozen or a
Jaynes-Cummings-like energy exchange is triggered between the bound photonic

changing abilities of the other players on court at different times during a
match. The new method uses multiple seasons' data in a structured way to
estimate player ability in an isolated season, measuring separately defensive
and offensive merit as well as combining these to give an overall rating. The
use of game statistics in predicting player ability will be considered. Results
using data from the 2008/9 season suggest that LeBron James, who won the NBA
MVP award, was the best overall player. The best defensive player was Lamar
Odom and the best rookie was Russell Westbrook, neither of whom won an NBA
award that season. The results further indicate that whilst the
frequently-reported game statistics provide some information on offensive
ability, they do not perform well in the prediction of defensive ability.

theory, and the important roles of the screening for the gluon propagation are
elucidated. Static screening for the longitudinal gluons improves the infrared
singularities, while the transverse gluons receive only dynamic screening. The
latter property gives rise to a novel non-Fermi-liquid behaviour in the
magnetic susceptibility. The critical density is estimated to be around the
nuclear density and the Curie temperature several tens MeV. The spin density
wave is also discussed at moderate densities, where chiral transition becomes
important. Pseudoscalar condensate as well as scalar one takes a spatially
non-uniform form in a chirally invariant way. Accordingly magnetization
oscillates like spin density wave. These results should have some implications

and an effective cellular composition from an effective, coarse-grained
representation of its genome. We assume that E. coli is in a state of balanced
exponential steadystate growth, growing in a temporally and spatially constant
environment, rich in resources. We apply this model to a series of past
measurements, where the growth rate and rRNA-to-protein ratio have been
measured for seven E. coli strains with an rRNA operon copy number ranging from
one to seven (the wild-type copy number). These experiments show that growth
rate markedly decreases for strains with fewer than six copies. Using the
model, we were able to reproduce these measurements. We show that the model
that best fits these data suggests that the volume fraction of macromolecules
inside E. coli is not fixed when the rRNA operon copy number is varied.
Moreover, the model predicts that increasing the copy number beyond seven
results in a cytoplasm densely packed with ribosomes and proteins. Assuming
that under such overcrowded conditions prolonged diffusion times tend to weaken
binding affinities, the model predicts that growth rate will not increase
substantially beyond the wild-type growth rate, as indicated by other
experiments. Our model therefore suggests that changing the rRNA operon copy
number of wild-type E. coli cells growing in a constant rich environment does
not substantially increase their growth rate. Other observations regarding
strains with an altered rRNA operon copy number, such as nucleoid compaction
and the rRNA operon feedback response, appear to be qualitatively consistent
with this model. In addition, we discuss possible design principles suggested
by the model and propose further experiments to test its validity.

incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence permeated by a strong mean
magnetic field. The turbulent flow is generated by high-resolution
pseudo-spectral direct numerical simulations with large-scale isotropic
forcing. Examining the radial energy distribution for various angles $\theta$
with respect to $\mathbf{B}_0$ reveals a specific structure which remains
hidden when not taking axial symmetry with respect to $B_0$ into account. For
each direction, starting at the forced large-scales, the spectrum first
exhibits an amplitude drop around a wavenumber $k_0$ which marks the start of a
scaling range and goes on up to a dissipative wavenumber $k_d(\theta)$. The 3D
spectrum for $k \ge k_0$ is described by a single $\theta$-independent
functional form $F(k/k_d)$, the scaling law being the same in every direction.
The previous properties still hold when increasing the mean field from $B_0=5$
up to $B_0=10 \ b_{rms}$, as well as when passing from resistive to ideal
flows. We conjecture that at fixed $B_0$ the direction-independent scaling
regime is reached when increasing the Reynolds number above a threshold which
raises with increasing $B_0$. Below that threshold critically balanced
turbulence is expected.

methods, the information theoretic criteria (ITC) based method is a promising
blind method which can reliably detect the primary users while requiring little
prior information. In this paper, we provide an intensive treatment on the ITC
sensing method. To this end, we first introduce a new over-determined channel
model constructed by applying multiple antennas or over sampling at the
secondary user in order to make the ITC applicable. Then, a simplified ITC
sensing algorithm is introduced, which needs to compute and compare only two
decision values. Compared with the original ITC sensing algorithm, the
simplified algorithm significantly reduces the computational complexity without
losing any performance. Applying the recent advances in random matrix theory,
we then derive closed-form expressions to tightly approximate both the
probability of false alarm and probability of detection. Based on the insight
derived from the analytical study, we further present a generalized ITC sensing
algorithm which can provide flexible tradeoff between the probability of
detection and probability of false alarm. Finally, comprehensive simulations
are carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed ITC sensing
algorithms. Results show that they considerably outperform other blind spectrum

precoder design in multi-user (MU) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
systems. It decouples the precoder design problem and makes closed-form
solution available. In this letter, we present a new linear precoding scheme by
slightly relaxing the SLNR maximization for MU-MIMO systems with multiple data
streams per user. The precoding matrices are obtained by a general form of
simultaneous diagonalization of two Hermitian matrices. The new scheme reduces
the gap between the per-stream effective channel gains, an inherent limitation
in the original SLNR precoding scheme. Simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed precoding achieves considerable gains in error performance over the
original one for multi-stream transmission while maintaining almost the same
achievable sum-rate.

definite matrix, is not convex in general. From matrix/convex analysis point of
view, it is interesting to address the question: When is this function convex?
In this paper, we investigate the convexity of this function by the condition
number of its matrix. In 2-dimensional space, we prove that the Kantorovich
function is convex if and only if the condition number of its matrix is bounded
above by $3+2\sqrt{2}, $ and thus the convexity of the function with two
variables can be completely characterized by the condition number. The upper
bound `$3+2\sqrt{2} $' is turned out to be a necessary condition for the
convexity of Kantorovich functions in any finite-dimensional spaces. We also
point out that when the condition number of the matrix (which can be any
dimensional) is less than or equal to $\sqrt{5+2\sqrt{6}}, $ the Kantorovich
function is convex. Furthermore, we prove that this general sufficient
convexity condition can be remarkably improved in 3-dimensional space. Our
analysis shows that the convexity of the function is closely related to some
modern optimization topics such as the semi-infinite linear matrix inequality
or 'robust positive semi-definiteness' of symmetric matrices. In fact, our main
result for 3-dimensional cases has been proved by finding an explicit solution
range to some semi-infinite linear matrix inequalities.

Prominent subclasses of $\nu$-spherical distributions are spherically symmetric

of these classes contain the Gaussian as a special case. In general, however,
$\nu$-spherical distributions are computationally intractable since, for
instance, the normalization constant or fast sampling algorithms are unknown
for an arbitrary $\nu$. In this paper we introduce a new subclass of

effect in the AA-stacked graphene is expected. We have thus calculated the
quantized Hall conductivity $\sigma_{xy}$ and also longitudinal conductivity
$\sigma_{xx}$ of the AA-stacked BLG within the linear response Kubo formalism.
Interestingly, we find that the AA-stacked BLG could exhibit both conventional
insulating behavior (the $\bar{\nu}=0$ plateau) and chirality for
$|\bar{\mu}|<t$, where $\bar{\nu}$ is the filling factor
($\bar{\nu}=\sigma_{xy}h/e^{2}$), $\bar{\mu}$ is the chemical potential, and
$t$ is the interlayer hopping energy, in striking contrast to the monlayer

high-magnetic-field regime, $\sigma_{xx}\rightarrow0$ as long as the Fermi
level is not close to a Dirac point, where $\Gamma$ denotes the Landau level
broadening induced by disorder. Furthermore, when $\sigma_{xy}$ is plotted as a

$\omega$ of the above eigenvalue of the stability matrix. The other bifurcation

asymmetric squares, relaxation oscillations with intermediate squares, some of

the X-ray emission from the Intra Cluster Medium (ICM). This phenomenon is
associated with complex physics in the ICM and has been a subject of intense
debate and investigation in recent years. In order to quantify the evolution in
the cool-core cluster population, we robustly measure the cool-core strength in
a local, representative cluster sample, and in the largest sample of
high-redshift clusters available to date. We use high-resolution Chandra data
of three representative cluster samples spanning different redshift ranges: (i)
the local sample from the 400 SD survey with median z = 0.08, (ii) the high
redshift sample from the 400 SD Survey with median z=0.59, and (iii) 15
clusters drawn from the RDCS and the WARPS, with median z = 0.83. Our analysis
is based on the measurement of the surface brightness concentration, c_SB,
which allows us to characterize the cool-core strength in low signal-to-noise
data. We also obtain gas density profiles to derive cluster central cooling
times and entropy. In addition to the X-ray analysis, we search for radio
counterparts associated with the cluster cores. We find a statistically
significant difference in the c_SB distributions of the two high-z samples,
pointing towards a lack of concentrated clusters in the 400 SD high-z sample.
Taking this into account, we confirm a negative evolution in the fraction of
cool-core clusters with redshift, in particular for very strong cool-cores.
This result is validated by the central entropy and central cooling time, which
show strong anti-correlations with c_SB. However, the amount of evolution is
significantly smaller than previously claimed, leaving room for a large
population of well formed cool-cores at z~1.

key testing sites for models of disc assembly and evolution. Important issues
are the epoch at which the bulk of the stars in these regions formed and how
discs grow radially over time. To address these issues, we use Hubble Space
Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys imaging to study the star formation
history (SFH) of two fields at 9.1 and 11.6 kpc along M33's northern major
axis. These fields lie at ~ 4 and 5 V-band disc scale-lengths and straddle the
break in M33's surface brightness profile. The colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs)
reach the ancient main sequence turnoff with a signal-to-noise ratio of ~ 5.
From detailed modelling of the CMDs, we find that the majority of stars in both
fields combined formed at z < 1. The mean age in the inner field, S1, is ~ 3
+/- 1 Gyr and the mean metallicity is [M/H] ~ -0.5 +/- 0.2 dex. The star
formation history of S1 unambiguously reveals how the inside-out growth
previously measured for M33's inner disc out to ~ 6 kpc extends out to the disc
edge at ~ 9 kpc. In comparison, the outer field, S2, is older (mean age ~ 7 +/-
2 Gyr), more metal-poor (mean [M/H] ~ -0.8 +/- 0.3 dex), and contains ~ 30
times less stellar mass. These results provide the most compelling evidence yet
that M33's age gradient reverses at large radii near the disc break and that
this reversal is accompanied by a break in stellar mass surface density. We
discuss several possible interpretations of this behaviour including radial
stellar mixing, warping of the gaseous disc, a change in star formation
efficiency, and a transition to another structural component. These results
offer one of the most detailed views yet of the peripheral regions of any disc
galaxy and provide a much-needed observational constraint on the last major
epoch of star formation in the outer disc.

interpretation method employs a multi-variate signal detection analysis aided
by a machine learning classification algorithm, called Self-Organizing Mapping
(SOM). Unlike in previous studies, this allows for combining multiple physical
image parameters, such as minimum and maximum values of the absorption
coefficient for identifying affected and not affected joints. Classification
performances obtained by the proposed method were evaluated in terms of
sensitivity, specificity, Youden index, and mutual information. Different
methods (i.e., clinical diagnostics, ultrasound imaging, magnet resonance
imaging and inspection of optical tomographic images), were used as ""ground
truth""-benchmarks to determine the performance of image interpretations. Using
data from 100 finger joints, findings suggest that some parameter combinations
lead to higher sensitivities while others to higher specificities when compared
to single parameter classifications employed in previous studies. Maximum
performances were reached when combining minimum/maximum-ratio and image
variance with respect to ultra sound as benchmark. In this case, sensitivity
and specificity of 0.94 and 0.96 respectively were achieved. These values are
much higher than results reported when a) other classification techniques were
applied or b) single parameter classifications were used, where sensitivities

small but important subset of radio galaxies showing an X-shaped morphology
(XRGs) we propose a generalized model, based on the jet-shell interaction and
spin-flip hypotheses. The most popular scenarios for this intriguing phenomenon
invoke either hydrodynamical backflows and over-pressured cocoons or rapid jet
reorientations, presumably from the spin-flips of central engines following the
mergers of pairs of galaxies, each of which contains a supermassive black hole
(SMBH). We confront these models with a number of key observations and thus
argue that none of the models is capable of explaining the entire range of
salient observational properties of XRGs, although some of the arguments raised
in the literature against the spin-flip scenario are probably not tenable. We
then propose here a new scenario which also involves galactic mergers but would
allow the spin of the central engine to maintain its direction. Motivated by
the detailed multi-band observations of the nearest radio galaxy, Centaurus A,
this new model emphasizes the role of interactions between the jets and the
shells of stars and gas that form and rotate around the merged galaxy and can
cause temporary deflections of the jets, occasionally giving rise to an
X-shaped radio structure. Although each of the models is likely to be relevant
to a subset of XRGs, the bulk of the evidence indicates that most of them are
best explained by the jet-shell interaction or spin-flip hypotheses.

improbable that substituting a root of unity into a polynomial with integer

cyclic sieving phenomenon have now been found. Furthermore, the proofs that

proposed to reproduce the secular relativistic effects in the orbital elements.
Generally, models introduce artificial perturbations that are
velocity-independent but that depend on the heliocentric distance. If these
perturbations are set as an impulse in a constant timestep integrator, when the
particle approaches perihelion the generated impulse could be very strong and
badly sampled, originating a spurious orbital evolution. In order to overcome
this setback, we propose two new models based on a constant,
distance-independent, perturbation. With these models we obtain the correct
secular drift in the argument of perihelion and the expected secular orbital
evolution is reproduced. We also discuss with some detail the secular effect

pion-pair photoproduction process $\pi^-\gamma \to \pi^-\pi^0\pi^0$. At leading
order this reaction is governed by the chiral pion-pion interaction. Since the
chiral $\pi^+\pi^-\to\pi^0\pi^0$ contact-vertex depends only on the final-state
invariant-mass it factors out of all photon-loop diagrams. We give analytical
expressions for the multiplicative correction factor $R\sim \alpha/2\pi$
arising from eight classes of contributing one-photon loop diagrams. An
electromagnetic counterterm has to be included in order to cancel the
ultraviolet divergences generated by the photon-loops. Infrared finiteness of
the virtual radiative corrections is achieved (in the standard way) by
including soft photon radiation below an energy cut-off $\lambda$. The
radiative corrections to the total cross section vary between $+2\%$ and $-2\%$
for center-of-mass energies from threshold up to $7m_\pi$. The finite part of
the electromagnetic counterterm gives an additional constant contribution of
about $1\%$, however with a large uncertainty.

opportunity to study all known morphological types of galaxies in the mid-IR at
a depth significantly better than ground-based near-infrared and optical
images. The goal of this study is to examine the imprint of the de Vaucouleurs
classification volume in the 3.6 micron band, which is the best Spitzer
waveband for galactic stellar mass morphology owing to its depth and its
reddening-free sensitivity mainly to older stars. For this purpose, we have
prepared classification images for 207 galaxies from the Spitzer archive, most
of which are formally part of the Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in
Galaxies (S^4G), a Spitzer post-cryogenic (""warm"") mission Exploration Science
Legacy Program survey of 2,331 galaxies closer than 40 Mpc. For the purposes of
morphology, the galaxies are interpreted as if the images are {\it blue light},
the historical waveband for classical galaxy classification studies. We find
that 3.6 micron classifications are well-correlated with blue-light
classifications, to the point where the essential features of many galaxies
look very similar in the two very different wavelength regimes. Drastic
differences are found only for the most dusty galaxies. Consistent with a
previous study by Eskridge et al. (2002), the main difference between blue
light and mid-IR types is an approximately 1 stage interval difference for S0/a
to Sbc or Sc galaxies, which tend to appear ""earlier"" in type at 3.6 microns
due to the slightly increased prominence of the bulge, the reduced effects of
extinction, and the reduced (but not completely eliminated) effect of the
extreme population I stellar component. We present an atlas of all of the 207
galaxies analyzed here, and bring attention to special features or galaxy types
that are particularly distinctive in the mid-IR.

weather conditions, an additional layer was detected at 6 - 8 km above sea
level. $V(h)$ profiling suggests that tropopause layer velocities are nominally
12 - 30 m/s, and near-ground velocities range between 2 -- 20 m/s, dependent on
weather. Little seasonal variation was detected in either $C_n^2(h)$ and $V(h)$
profiles. The average coherence length, $r_0$, was found to be $7 \pm 1$ cm for
the full profile at a wavelength of 589 nm. The average isoplanatic angle,
$\theta_0$, was $1.0 \pm 0.1$ arcsec. The mean turbulence altitude,
$\bar{h_0}$, was found to be $2.0\pm0.7$ km above sea level. No average in the
Greenwood frequency, $f_G$, could be established due to the gaps present in the

describe the $C_n^2(h)$ profiles at Mount John, which estimates $r_0$ at 6 cm
