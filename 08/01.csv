source of the EXOR outbursts. The system has been identified as the source of a
large outflow, however, previous studies have failed to identify the driver.
Here we present adaptive optics (AO) assisted [FeII] spectro-images which
reveal for the first time the presence of two jets. Observations made using
OSIRIS at the Keck Observatory show the Herbig Be star to be the source of the
parsec-scale outflow, which within 2'' of the source shows signs of wiggling
and the FUOR to '' be driving a ~ 0.4 jet. The wiggling of the Herbig Be star's
jet is evidence for an additional companion which could in fact be generating
the EXOR outbursts, the last of which began in 2008 (Grankin & Artemenko 2009).
Indeed the dy- namical scale of the wiggling corresponds to a time-scale of 4-8
years which is in agreement with the time-scale of these outbursts. The
spectro-images also show a bow-shock shaped feature and possible associated
knots. The origin of this structure is as of yet unclear. Finally interesting
low velocity structure is also observed. One possibility is that it originates
in a wide-angle outflow launched from a circumbinary disk.

First, a direct measurement of the saturation scale is possible using the
broadening of the transverse momentum distribution of hadrons produced in
semi-inclusive DIS. This connection to saturation physics will provide a
quantitative measure of the degree to which this fundamental QCD phenomenon is
occurring, and has important consequences in other high-energy scattering
studies. Second, the measurement of quark energy loss is feasible, either as a
direct measurement at a lower-energy EIC, or as an indirect measurement using
hadron attenuation at higher energies. Such a measurement will offer the first
experimental validation of the energy independence of this process, which is a
consequence of the QCD analog of the LPM effect in QED. The third experiment is
to determine the mechanisms of hadronization using the nucleus as a spatial
analyzer, intercomparing hadron attenuation for nuclei of a range of sizes. The
extended reach of the EIC in energy will allow probes of these mechanisms in
the crucial high-z region for the heaviest nuclei, and will permit study of
hadronization in heavy quark meson and baryon systems.

quantifying the mean abundance and abundance dispersion in iron and carbon, and
searching for distant radial-velocity members, in these systems.
  The primary conclusion of our investigation is that the spread of carbon
abundance in both Bootes I and Segue 1 is large. For Bootes I, 4 of our 16
velocity members have [C/H] < ~-3.1, while 2 have [C/H] > ~-2.3, suggesting a
range of Delta[C/H] ~ 0.8. For Segue 1 there exists a range Delta[C/H] ~ 1.0,
including our discovery of a star with [Fe/H] = -3.5 and [C/Fe] = +2.3, which
is a radial velocity member at a distance of 4 half-light radii from the system
center. The accompanying ranges in iron abundance are Delta[Fe/H] ~ 1.6 for
both Bootes I and Segue 1. For [Fe/H] < -3.0, the Galaxy's dwarf galaxy
satellites exhibit a dependence of [C/Fe] on [Fe/H] which is very similar to
that observed in its halo populations. We find [C/Fe] ~ 0.3 for stars in the
dwarf systems that we believe are the counterpart of the Spite et al. (2005)
``unmixed'' giants of the Galactic halo and for which they report [C/Fe] ~ 0.2,
and which presumably represents the natal relative abundance of carbon for
material with [Fe/H] = -3.0 to -4.0.
  We confirm the correlation between luminosity and both mean metallicity and
abundance dispersion in the Galaxy's dwarf satellites, which extends to at
least as faint as Mv = -5. The very low mean metallicity of Segue 1, and the
high carbon dispersion in Bootes I, consistent with inhomogeneous chemical
evolution in near zero-abundance gas, suggest these ultra-faint systems could
be surviving examples of the very first bound systems.

spiral counterparts, S0/a and Sa galaxies. The differences are significant and
cannot be due entirely to uncertainties in the assumed vertical scale-heights
or in the assumption of constant mass-to-light ratios. Part of the difference
is likely due simply to the dilution of the bar torques by the higher mass
bulges seen in S0s. If spiral galaxies accrete external gas, as advocated by
Bournaud & Combes, then the fewer strong bars found among S0s imply a lack of
gas accretion according to this theory. If S0s are stripped former spirals, or
else are evolved from former spirals due to internal secular dynamical
processes which deplete the gas as well as grow the bulges, then the weaker
bars and the prevalence of lenses in S0 galaxies could further indicate that
bar evolution continues to proceed during and even after gas depletion

which the model was set up. This Force has gone through stages of development:
first of all, Helbing and Molnar (1995) have modeled the original force for the
normal situation. Second, Helbing and his co-workers (2000) have incorporated
the panic situation into this force by incorporating the panic parameter to
account for the panic situations. Third, Lakoba and Kaup (2005) have provided
the pedestrians some kind of intelligence by incorporating aspects of the

important incorporations into the model regarding the preferred force. They
make comparisons between the different factors of these incorporations.
Furthermore, to enhance the decision-making ability of the pedestrians, they
introduce additional features such as the familiarity factor to the preferred
force to let it appear more representative of what actually happens in reality.

dense actuator spacing and fine wavefront sampling with large dynamic range. In
addition, atmospheric dispersion is much more significant in the visible than
in the near-IR. Imaging over a broad visible band requires a very good
Atmospheric Dispersion Corrector (ADC). Even with these technologies, our AO
simulations using the CAOS code, combined with the optical and site parameters

visible ({\lambda}=0.7 micron) Strehl on timescales of 50 ms. Over several

Cointegrated Vector Auto Regression (CVAR) Model. We extend standard CVAR
models to incorporate estimation of model parameters in the presence of price
series level shifts which are not accurately modeled in the standard Gaussian
error correction model (ECM) framework. This involves developing a novel matrix
variate Bayesian CVAR mixture model comprised of Gaussian errors intra-day and
Alpha-stable errors inter-day in the ECM framework. To achieve this we derive a
novel conjugate posterior model for the Scaled Mixtures of Normals (SMiN CVAR)
representation of Alpha-stable inter-day innovations. These results are
generalized to asymmetric models for the innovation noise at inter-day
boundaries allowing for skewed Alpha-stable models.
  Our proposed model and sampling methodology is general, incorporating the
current literature on Gaussian models as a special subclass and also allowing
for price series level shifts either at random estimated time points or known a
priori time points. We focus analysis on regularly observed non-Gaussian level
shifts that can have significant effect on estimation performance in
statistical models failing to account for such level shifts, such as at the
close and open of markets. We compare the estimation accuracy of our model and
estimation approach to standard frequentist and Bayesian procedures for CVAR
models when non-Gaussian price series level shifts are present in the

extended shape of matter field equations like the Dirac equation. If there is
postulated invariance of such a generalized field equation under local gauge
transformations, the usual covariant derivative containing the gauge potential
has to be replaced by a generalized covariant derivative. This leads to a
generalized interaction between the matter field and the gauge field as well as
to an additional self interaction of the gauge field. Since the existence of a
minimal length scale seems to be a necessary assumption of any consistent

polar gas molecules due to a charge-dipole interaction. In humid air, the
substantial electrostatic attraction and acceleration of surrounding water
vapour molecules towards charged combustible nanoparticles cause intense
electrostatic hydration and preferential oxidation of these nanoparticles by
accelerated water vapor molecules rather than non-polar oxygen molecules. In
particular, electrostatic acceleration, acquired by surrounding water vapour
molecules at a distance of their mean free path from the minimally charged iron
metal nanoparticle can increase an oxidative activity of these polar molecules
with respect to the nanoparticle by a factor of one million. Intense
electrostatic hydration of charged metal nanoparticles converts the
nanoparticle's oxide based shells into the hydroxide based electrolyte shells,
transforming these nanoparticles into metal/air core-shell nanobatteries,
periodically short-circuited by intra-particle field and thermionic electron
emission. Partially synchronized breakdowns within trillions of
nanoparticles-nanobatteries turn a cloud of charged nanoparticles-nanobatteries
- ball lightning - into a powerful radio-frequency aerosol generator.
Electrostatic hydration and charge-catalyzed oxidation of charged combustible
nanoparticles also contribute to a self-oscillating thermocycling process of
evolution and periodic auto-ignition of inflammable gases near to the

theories is explored. We employ power counting in order to construct the action
and search for the minimal requirements it should satisfy for the connection to
be dynamical. We find that for the most general action containing lower order
invariants of the curvature and the torsion the independent connection does not
carry any dynamics. It actually reduces to the role of an auxiliary field and
can be completely eliminated algebraically in favour of the metric and the
matter field, introducing extra interactions with respect to general
relativity. However, we also show that including higher order terms in the
action radically changes this picture and excites new degrees of freedom in the
connection, making it (or parts of it) dynamical. Constructing actions that
constitute exceptions to this rule requires significant fine tuned and/or extra
a priori constraints on the connection. We also consider f(R) actions as a
particular example in order to show that they constitute a distinct class of
metric-affine theories with special properties, and as such they cannot be used
as representative toy theories to study the properties of metric-affine
gravity.

be used in specific situations. We perform a systematic study of more or less
dense 1D and 2D arrays of nanowires using either finite size or infinite size

dimensional crossover of few-layer graphene (FLG) from two-dimensional graphene
to three-dimensional graphite. $\gamma_{c}$ is found by analyzing available
experimental data on different properties of FLG with varying thickness. A
theoretical study on the phonon spectrum of the vertical acoustic mode in FLG
is carried out to further check this exponential factor $\gamma_{c}$.
Interestingly, the same exponential factor appears in the dimensional crossover
of the phonon mode. It turns out that the exponential factor $\gamma_{c}$ is
related to the homogeneous Helmholtz-like molal equation in the mass transfer
with a first order chemical reaction. The finding should provide valuable
information for experimentalists and theorists in the future investigation on
thickness dependent properties of FLG.

the twin paradox, the fact that the time between two events in space-time
appears to depend on the path between these events. We show that this time
discrepancy results only from faulty assumptions in the transition from one
reference system to another. The twin paradox does not exist. But the Lorentz
invariance of the theory has strong consequences, if we assume that it is valid
not only locally, but also on cosmic scale.

  one. Compared to the first two versions there are several minor changes","Representation Theory 16 (2012), 1--87",,,"math.RT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Let $R$ be a root datum with affine Weyl group $W^e$, and let $H = H (R,q)$
be an affine Hecke algebra with positive, possibly unequal, parameters $q$.
Then $H$ is a deformation of the group algebra $\mathbb C [W^e]$, so it is
natural to compare the representation theory of $H$ and of $W^e$.
  We define a map from irreducible $H$-representations to $W^e$-representations
and we show that, when extended to the Grothendieck groups of finite
dimensional representations, this map becomes an isomorphism, modulo torsion.
The map can be adjusted to a (nonnatural) continuous bijection from the dual
space of $H$ to that of $W^e$. We use this to prove the affine Hecke algebra
version of a conjecture of Aubert, Baum and Plymen, which predicts a strong and
explicit geometric similarity between the dual spaces of $H$ and $W^e$.
  An important role is played by the Schwartz completion $S = S (R,q)$ of $H$,
an algebra whose representations are precisely the tempered
$H$-representations. We construct isomorphisms $\zeta_\epsilon : S
(R,q^\epsilon) \to S (R,q)$ $(\epsilon >0)$ and injection $\zeta_0 : S (W^e) =
S (R,q^0) \to S (R,q)$, depending continuously on $\epsilon$.
  Although $\zeta_0$ is not surjective, it behaves like an algebra isomorphism
in many ways. Not only does $\zeta_0$ extend to a bijection on Grothendieck
groups of finite dimensional representations, it also induces isomorphisms on
topological $K$-theory and on periodic cyclic homology (the first two modulo
torsion). This proves a conjecture of Higson and Plymen, which says that the
$K$-theory of the $C^*$-completion of an affine Hecke algebra $H (R,q)$ does
not depend on the parameter(s) $q$.

Using strict deduction with mathematics, the sparsity of echo in dictionary is
proved and the dictionary is orthogonal. In the application property, the
construction of dictionary is simple, the parameters that are needed for
dictionary can be obtained conveniently and the dictionary is convenient to
use. Furthermore, the object of application can be expanded to the echo of
multi-component chirps with single freedom degree.
