In our structure the quantization of energy levels and the Coulomb blockade
lead to the transfer of quantized packets of energy from a hot source into an
electric conductor to which it is capacitively coupled. The fluctuation
generated transfer of a single energy quantum translates into the directed
motion of a single electron. Thus in our structure the ratio of the charge
current to the heat current is determined by the ratio of the charge quantum to
the energy quantum. An important novel aspect of our approach is that the
direction of energy flow and the direction of electron motion are decoupled.

final RM cubes. The radio galaxies and the filaments at the edges of the halo
are detected in the high-frequency RM cube, obtained by combining the data at
18, 21, and 25 cm. Their Faraday spectra show different levels of complexity.
The radio galaxies lying near by the cluster center have Faraday spectra with
multiple peaks, while those at large distances show only one peak, as do the
filaments. Similar RM distributions are observed for the external radio
galaxies and for the filaments, with much lower average RM values and RM
variance than those found in previous works for the central radio galaxies. The
85 cm RM cube is dominated by the Galactic foreground emission, but it also
shows features associated with the cluster. At 2 m, no polarized emission from
A2255 nor our Galaxy is detected. The radial trend observed in the RM
distributions of the radio galaxies and in the complexity of their Faraday
spectra favors the interpretation that the external Faraday screen for all the
sources in A2255 is the ICM. Its differential contribution depends on the
amount of medium that the radio signal crosses along the line of sight. The
filaments should therefore be located at the periphery of the cluster, and
their apparent central location comes from projection effects. Their high
fractional polarization and morphology suggest that they are relics rather than
part of a genuine radio halo. Their inferred large distance from the cluster

analysis of a large sample of planet-hosting and control sample dwarf stars. A
comparison between the distributions of [Fe/H] in planet-hosting main-sequence
stars, subgiants, and giants within these samples finds that the main-sequence
stars and subgiants have the same mean metallicity of <[Fe/H]> \simeq +0.11
dex, while the giant sample is typically more metal poor, having an average
metallicity of <[Fe/H]> = -0.06 dex. The fact that the subgiants have the same
average metallicities as the dwarfs indicates that significant accretion of
solid metal-rich material onto the planet-hosting stars has not taken place, as
such material would be diluted in the evolution from dwarf to subgiant. The
lower metallicity found for the planet-hosting giant stars in comparison with
the planet-hosting dwarfs and subgiants is interpreted as being related to the
underlying stellar mass, with giants having larger masses and thus, on average
larger-mass protoplanetary disks. In core accretion models of planet formation,
larger disk masses can contain the critical amount of metals necessary to form
giant planets even at lower metallicities.

been the subject of debate after it appeared in some studies to be dominated by
the s-process. We provide an independent measure of the Ba isotope mixture in
HD140283 using an extremely high quality spectrum and an extensive chi^2
analysis. We exploit hyperfine splitting of the BaII 4554 \AA\ and 4934 \AA\
resonance lines in an effort to constrain the isotope ratio in 1D LTE. Using
the code ATLAS in conjunction with KURUCZ06 model atmospheres we analyse 93 Fe
lines to determine the star's macroturbulence. With this information we
construct a grid of Ba synthetic spectra and, using a \chi^2 code, fit these to
our observed data to determine the isotopic ratio, fodd, which represents the
ratio of odd to even isotopes. We also analyse the Eu lines. We set a new upper
limit of the rotation of HD140283 at vsin{i}\leq3.9\kms, a new upper limit on
[Eu/H] < -2.80 and abundances [Fe/H] = -2.59\pm0.09, [Ba/H] = -3.46\pm0.11.
This leads to a new lower limit on [Ba/Eu] > -0.66. We find that, in the
framework of a 1D LTE analysis, the isotopic ratios of Ba in HD140283 indicate
fodd=0.02\pm0.06, a purely s-process signature. This implies that observations
and analysis do not validate currently accepted theory. We speculate that a 1D
code, due to simplifying assumptions, is not adequate when dealing with
observations with high levels of resolution and S/N because of the turbulent
motions associated with a 3D stellar atmosphere. New approaches to analysing
isotopic ratios, in particular 3D hydrodynamics, need to be considered when
dealing with the levels of detail required to properly determine them. However
published 3D results exacerbate the disagreement between theory and

all invariant measures on Y have entropy <t, and if (X,T) is another free

One gets a strictly t-universal system from mixing shifts of finite type of
entropy at least t by removing the periodic points and ""restricting"" to the
part of the system of entropy <t. As a consequence, after removing their
periodic points the systems in the following classes are completely classified
by entropy up to Borel isomorphism off null sets: mixing shifts of finite type,
mixing positive-recurrent countable state Markov chains, mixing sofic shifts,
beta shifts, synchronized subshifts, and axiom-A diffeomorphisms. In particular
any two equal-entropy systems from these classes are entropy conjugate in the

their black hole remnants. The strength of the limits depends on the choice of
annihilation channel and black hole mass; limits are strongest for the heaviest
black holes and annhilation to $b \bar{b}$ and $W^+W^-$ final states. The
larger black holes considered in this paper may arise as the remnants of Dark

adiabatically until the central charges become anti -parallel, a paradox
arises. We show that this paradox is always resolved by the existence of ""bound

that can take place on these walls, which we call recombination and
conjugation. The latter is associated to the presence of singularities at
finite distance in moduli space. Consistency of conjugation and wall-crossing
rules near these singularities leads to new constraints on the BPS spectrum.
Singular loci supporting massless vector bosons are particularly subtle in this

The system has a close in planet and it can potentially affect the coronal
structure via interactions with the magnetosphere. We have obtained X-ray
spectra and light curves from EPIC and RGS on board XMM-Newton which we have
analyzed and interpreted. We reduced X-ray data from primary transit and
secondary eclipse occurred in April 17th 2007 and May 18th 2009, respectively.
In the April 2007 observation only variability due to weak flares is
recognized. In 2009 HD189733 exhibited a X-ray flux always larger than in the
2007 observation. The average flux in 2009 was higher than in 2007 observation
by a factor of 45%. During the 2009 secondary eclipse we observed a softening
of the X-ray spectrum significant at level of ~3 sigma. Further, we observed
the most intense flare recorded at either epochs. This flare occurred 3 ks
after the end of the eclipse.The flare decay shows several minor ignitions
perhaps linked to the main event and hinting for secondary loops that emit
triggered by the main loop. Magneto-Hydro-Dynamical (MHD) simulations show that
the magnetic interaction between planet and star enhances the density and the
magnetic field in a region comprised between the planet and the star because of
their relative orbital/rotation motion. X-ray observations and model
predictions are globally found in agreement, despite the quite simple MHD model
and the lack of precise estimate of parameters including the alignment and the
intensity of stellar and planetary magnetic fields. Future observations should
confirm or disprove this hypothesis, by determining whether flares are
systematically recurring in the light curve at the same planetary phase.

handle such a situation, an approach combining the non-Markovian quantum state
diffusion (NMQSD) description of open quantum systems with an efficient but
abstract approximation was recently applied to calculate energy transfer and
absorption spectra of molecular aggregates [Roden, Eisfeld, Wolff, Strunz, PRL

complicated systems, in the present work we compare the calculated
(approximative) absorption spectra with exact results. These are obtained from
the method of pseudomodes, which we show to be capable of determining the exact
spectra for small aggregates and a few pseudomodes. It turns out that in the
cases considered, the results of the two approaches mostly agree quite well.
The advantages and disadvantages of the two approaches are discussed.

interface displays different scaling regimes at small and large lengthscales.
Using a replica approach and a Gaussian Variational Method (GVM), we explore
the consequences of a finite interface width $\xi$ on the small-lengthscale
fluctuations. We compute analytically the static roughness $B(r)$ of the
interface as a function of the distance $r$ between two points on the
interface. We focus on the case of short-range elasticity and random-bond
disorder. We show that for a finite width $\xi$ two temperature regimes exist.
At low temperature, the expected thermal and random-manifold regimes,
respectively for small and large scales, connect via an intermediate `modified'
Larkin regime, that we determine. This regime ends at a temperature-independent
characteristic `Larkin' length. Above a certain `critical' temperature that we
identify, this intermediate regime disappears. The thermal and random-manifold
regimes connect at a single crossover lengthscale, that we compute. This is
also the expected behavior for zero width. Using a directed polymer
description, we also study via a second GVM procedure and generic scaling
arguments, a modified toy model that provides further insights on this
crossover. We discuss the relevance of the two GVM procedures for the roughness
at large lengthscale in those regimes. In particular we analyze the scaling of
the temperature-dependent prefactor in the roughness $B(r)\sim T^{2

briefly discuss the consequences of those results for the quasistatic creep law

matter in 3 dimensions. The interest in these theories is two-fold. On the one
hand, it is a new family of theories in which to test the AdS/CFT
correspondence and on the other, they are important to study one of the main
objects of M-theory (M2-branes). All these theories have something in common:
they can be written in terms of 3-Leibniz algebras. Here we study the structure
theory of such algebras, paying special attention to a subclass of them that
gives rise to maximal supersymmetry and that was the first to appear in this
context: 3-Lie algebras.
  In chapter 2, we review the structure theory of metric Lie algebras and their
unitary representations. In chapter 3, we study metric 3-Leibniz algebras and
show, by specialising a construction originally due to Faulkner, that they are
in one to one correspondence with pairs of real metric Lie algebras and unitary
representations of them. We also show a third characterisation for six extreme
cases of 3-Leibniz algebras as graded Lie (super)algebras. In chapter 4, we
study metric 3-Lie algebras in detail. We prove a structural result and also
classify those with a maximally isotropic centre, which is the requirement that
ensures unitarity of the corresponding conformal field theory. Finally, in
chapter 5, we study the universal structure of superpotentials in this class of
superconformal Chern-Simons theories with matter in three dimensions. We
provide a uniform formulation for all these theories and establish the
connection between the amount of supersymmetry preserved and the gauge Lie
algebra and the appropriate unitary representation to be used to write down the
Lagrangian. The conditions for supersymmetry enhancement are then expressed
equivalently in the language of representation theory of Lie algebras or the
language of 3-Leibniz algebras.

evolution is determined by maximizing the rate of entropy production in general
and the rate of dissipation within purely mechanical considerations. We
constitutively prescribe forms for the specific Helmholtz potential and the
rate of dissipation (which is the product of density, temperature and the rate
of entropy production), and the model is derived by maximizing the rate of
dissipation with the constraint of incompressibility, and the reduced energy
dissipation equation is also regarded as a constraint in that it is required to
be met in every process that the body undergoes. The efficacy of the model is
ascertained by comparing the predictions of the model with the experimental

""scratch"" through particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm within the
evolutionary scheme. PSO technique is dramatically different with the genetic
algorithm and has apparently avoided the use of evolution operators (e.g.,
crossover and mutation). The approach is based on a highly efficient global
minimization of free energy surfaces merging total-energy calculations via PSO
technique and requires only chemical compositions for a given compound to
predict stable or metastable structures at given external conditions (e.g.,
pressure). A particularly devised geometrical structure factor method which
allows the elimination of similar structures during structure evolution was
implemented to enhance the structure search efficiency. The application of
designed variable unit cell size technique has greatly reduced the
computational cost. Moreover, the symmetry constraint imposed in the structure
generation enables the realization of diverse structures, leads to
significantly reduced search space and optimization variables, and thus fastens
the global structural convergence. The PSO algorithm has been successfully
applied to the prediction of many known systems (e.g., elemental, binary and
ternary compounds) with various chemical bonding environments (e.g., metallic,
ionic, and covalent bonding). The remarkable success rate demonstrates the
reliability of this methodology and illustrates the great promise of PSO as a
major technique on crystal structure determination.

convert times of arrival (TOAs) of pulses measured at an observatory to the

leads to a systematic variation in the observed timing residuals; specifically,
an incorrect planetary mass leads to a predominantly sinusoidal variation
having a period and phase associated with the planet's orbital motion about the
Sun. By using an array of pulsars (PSRs J0437-4715, J1744-1134, J1857+0943,
J1909-3744), the masses of the planetary systems from Mercury to Saturn have

paper describes a novel approach to the rates region, composed by the
time-sharing convex hull of 2^n-1 corner points achieved through On/Off binary
power control. The resulting rates region is denoted crystallized rates region.
By treating the interference as noise, the n-user rates region frontiers has
been found in the literature to be the convex hull of n hyper-surfaces. The
rates region bounded by these hyper-surfaces is not necessarily convex, and
thereby a convex hull operation is imposed through the strategy of
time-sharing. This paper simplifies this rates region in the n-dimensional
space by having only an On/Off binary power control. This consequently leads to
2^n-1 corner points situated within the rates region. A time-sharing convex
hull is imposed onto those corner points, forming the crystallized rates
region. The paper focuses on game theoretic concepts to achieve that
crystallized convex hull via correlated equilibrium. In game theory, the
correlated equilibrium set is convex, and it consists of the time-sharing mixed
strategies of the Nash equilibriums. In addition, the paper considers a
mechanism design approach to carefully design a utility function, particularly
the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves auction utility, where the solution point is situated
on the correlated equilibrium set. Finally, the paper proposes a self learning
algorithm, namely the regret-matching algorithm, that converges to the solution
point on the correlated equilibrium set in a distributed fashion.

The dipole-dipole interaction between the monomers leads to shifts of the
oligomer spectra with respect to the monomer absorption. The line-shapes of
monomer as well as oligomer absorption depend strongly on the coupling to
vibrational modes. Using a recently developed approach [Roden et. al, PRL 103,

structure of stellar magnetic fields, thanks to advances in detection methods
such as Zeeman-Doppler Imaging. The extrapolation of this surface magnetic
field into the corona has provided 3D models of the coronal magnetic field and
plasma. This method is sensitive mainly to the magnetic field in the bright
regions of the stellar surface. The dark (spotted) regions are censored because
the Zeeman signature there is suppressed. By modelling the magnetic field that
might have been contained in these spots, we have studied the effect that this
loss of information might have on our understanding of the coronal structure.
As examples, we have chosen two stars (V374 peg and AB Dor) that have very
different magnetograms and patterns of spot coverage. We find that the effect
of the spot field depends not only on the relative amount of flux in the spots,
but also its distribution across the stellar surface. For a star such as AB Dor
with a high spot coverage and a large polar spot, at its greatest effect the
spot field may almost double the fraction of the flux that is open (hence
decreasing the spindown time) while at the same time increasing the X-ray
emission measure by two orders of magnitude and significantly affecting the
X-ray rotational modulation.

technologies to enhance reliability and enforce sensible use of energy. Its
realization is geared by the fundamental goal of effective management of demand
load. In this work, we envision a scenario with real-time communication between
the operator and consumers. The grid operator controller receives requests for
power demands from consumers, with different power requirement, duration, and a
deadline by which it is to be completed. The objective is to devise a power
demand task scheduling policy that minimizes the grid operational cost over a
time horizon. The operational cost is a convex function of instantaneous power
consumption and reflects the fact that each additional unit of power needed to
serve demands is more expensive as demand load increases.First, we study the
off-line demand scheduling problem, where parameters are fixed and known. Next,
we devise a stochastic model for the case when demands are generated
continually and scheduling decisions are taken online and focus on long-term
average cost. We present two instances of power consumption control based on
observing current consumption. First, the controller may choose to serve a new
demand request upon arrival or to postpone it to the end of its deadline.
Second, the additional option exists to activate one of the postponed demands
when an active demand terminates. For both instances, the optimal policies are
threshold based. We derive a lower performance bound over all policies, which
is asymptotically tight as deadlines increase. We propose the Controlled
Release threshold policy and prove it is asymptotically optimal. The policy
activates a new demand request if the current power consumption is less than a
threshold, otherwise it is queued. Queued demands are scheduled when their
deadline expires or when the consumption drops below the threshold.

lenticular galaxies (dS0s), including peculiar dwarf elliptical galaxies (dEs)
with disk substructures and blue centers, show a surprisingly distinct and
tight locus separated from that of ordinary dEs, which is not clearly seen in
previous CMRs. The dS0s in UV CMRs follow a steeper sequence than dEs and show
bluer UV-optical color at a given magnitude. We also find that the UV CMRs of
dEs in the outer cluster region are slightly steeper than that of their
counterparts in the inner region, due to the existence of faint, blue dEs in
the outer region. We explore the observed CMRs with population models of a
luminosity-dependent delayed exponential star formation history. We confirm
that the feature of delayed star formation of early-type dwarf galaxies in
Virgo cluster is strongly correlated with their morphology and environment. The
observed CMR of dS0s is well matched by models with relatively long delayed
star formation. Our results suggest that dS0s are most likely transitional
objects at the stage of subsequent transformation of late-type progenitors to
ordinary red dEs in the cluster environment. In any case, UV photometry
provides a powerful tool to disentangle the diverse subpopulations of
early-type dwarf galaxies and uncover their evolutionary histories.

reasonable description of the reconstructed rutile (110) surface. Pt clusters
induce local surface relaxations that influence band edges of titania support,
and bring a number of band-gap states depending on the cluster size.
Significant band gap narrowing occurs upon Pt$_n$--surface interaction due to
adsorbate driven states on the bulk terminated and reduced surfaces. On the
other hand, they give rise to a band gap widening associated to partial
reoxidation of the reconstructed surface. No metallization arises even for
Pt$_4$ on rutile.

emission of one pion or eta are studied systematically. Based on a
non-relativistic effective field theory we show that charmed meson loops are
enhanced compared to the corresponding tree-level contributions for transitions
between two S-wave charmonia as well as for transitions between two P-wave
charmonia. On the contrary, for the transitions between one S-wave and one
P-wave charmonium state, the loops need to be analyzed case by case and often
appear to be suppressed. The relation to and possible implications for an
effective Lagrangian approach are also discussed. This study at the same time
provides a cross check for the numerical evaluations.

characterize operators that send the set of pure states with Schmidt rank no

operators that send separable pure states to separable pure states. We also
provide a new proof of an analogous statement in the multipartite setting. We
use these results to develop a bipartite version of a classical result about
the structure of maps that preserve rank-1 operators and then characterize the
isometries for two families of norms that have recently been studied in quantum
information theory. We see in particular that for k at least 2 the operator
norms induced by states with Schmidt rank k are invariant only under local
unitaries, the swap operator and the transpose map. However, in the k = 1 case
there is an additional isometry: the partial transpose map.

gravity, adopting the most general Sotiriou-Visser-Weinfurtner generalization
without the detailed balance but with projectability condition. After deriving
the general formulas in a flat FRW background, we find that the vector
perturbations are identical to those given in general relativity. This is true
also in the non-flat cases. For the tensor perturbations, high order
derivatives of the curvatures produce effectively an anisotropic stress, which
could have significant efforts on the high-frequency modes of gravitational
waves, while for the low-frenquency modes, the efforts are negligible. The
power spectrum is scale-invariant in the UV regime, because of the particular
dispersion relations. But, due to lower-order corrections, it will eventually
reduce to that given in GR in the IR limit. Applying the general formulas to
the de Sitter and power-law backgrounds, we calculate the power spectrum and
index, using the uniform approximations, and obtain their analytical
expressions in both cases.

primary rigidly curbs the secondary throughput, multiple secondary users have
the potential to more efficiently harvest the spectrum and share it among
themselves. This paper analyzes the sum throughput of a multiuser cognitive
radio system with multi-antenna base stations, either in the uplink or downlink
mode. The primary and secondary have $N$ and $n$ users, respectively, and their
base stations have $M$ and $m$ antennas, respectively. We show that an uplink
secondary throughput grows with $\frac{m}{N +1}\log n$ if the primary is a
downlink system, and grows with $\frac{m}{M +1}\log n$ if the primary is an
uplink system. These growth rates are shown to be optimal and can be obtained
with a simple threshold-based user selection rule. Furthermore, we show that
the secondary throughput can grow proportional to $\log n$ while simultaneously
pushing the interference on the primary down to zero, asymptotically.
Furthermore, we show that a downlink secondary throughput grows with $m\log
\log n$ in the presence of either an uplink or downlink primary system. In
addition, the interference on the primary can be made to go to zero
asymptotically while the secondary throughput increases proportionally to $\log
\log n$. Thus, unlike the point-to-point case, multiuser cognitive radios can
achieve non-trivial sum throughput despite stringent primary interference
constraints.
