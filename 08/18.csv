scattering length is constrained by universal relations that hold for any state
of the system. These relations involve a central property of the system called
the contact, which measures the number of pairs of fermions with different
spins that have small separations. The contact controls the thermodynamics of
the system as well as the large-momentum and high-frequency tails of
correlation functions. This review summarizes the current theoretical and
experimental status of these universal relations.

cleanly separate star formation (SF) and active galactic nucleus (AGN) in
individual galaxies. We first decompose mid-infrared Luminosity Functions
(LFs). We find that the SF 8um and 15um LFs are well described by Schechter
functions. AGNs dominate the space density at high luminosities, which leads to
the shallow bright-end slope of the overall mid-infrared LFs. The total
infrared (8-1000um) LF from 70um selected galaxies shows a shallower bright-end
slope than the bolometrically corrected SF 15um LF, owing to the intrinsic
dispersion in the mid-to-far-infrared spectral energy distributions. We then
study the contemporary growth of galaxies and their supermassive black holes
(BHs). Seven of the 31 Luminous Infrared Galaxies with Spitzer spectra host
luminous AGNs, implying an AGN duty cycle of 23+/-9%. The time-averaged ratio
of BH accretion rate and SF rate matches the local M_BH-M_bulge relation and
the M_BH-M_host relation at z ~ 1. These results favor co-evolution scenarios
in which BH growth and intense SF happen in the same event but the former spans
a shorter lifetime than the latter. Finally, we compare our mid-infrared
spectroscopic selection with other AGN identification methods and discuss
candidate Compton-thick AGNs in the sample. While only half of the mid-infrared
spectroscopically selected AGNs are detected in X-ray, ~90% of them can be
identified with their near-infrared spectral indices.

jump along the real axis, starting at the point 0 and making $n$ jumps to the

natural complexity. The co-existence of multi-scale structures such as auroral
arcs, turbulent convective flows, and scale-free distributions of energy
perturbations has lacked a unified explanation, although there is strong reason
to believe that they all stem from a common base of physics. In this paper we
show that a slow but turbulent convection leads to the formation of multi-scale
current filaments reminiscent of auroral arcs. The process involves an
interplay between random shuffling of field lines and dissipation of magnetic
energy on sub-MHD scales. As the filament system reaches a critical level of
complexity, local current disruption can trigger avalanches of energy release
of varying sizes, leading to scale-free distributions over energy perturbation,
power, and event duration. A long-term memory effect is observed whereby the
filament system replicates itself after each avalanche. The results support the
view that that the classical and inverse cascades operate simultaneously in the
magnetosphere. In the former, the high Reynolds-number plasma flow disintegrate
into turbulence through successive breakdowns; in the latter, the interactions
of small-scale flow eddies with the magnetic field can self-organize into
elongated current filaments and large-scale energy avalanches mimicking the
substorm.

superconformal coupling of matter to supergravity. In these models, which we
call the canonical superconformal supergravity (CSS) models, the kinetic terms
in the Jordan frame are canonical, and the scalar potential is the same as in
the global theory. The pure supergravity part of the total action has a local
Poincare supersymmetry, whereas the chiral and vector multiplets coupled to
supergravity have a larger local superconformal symmetry. The scale-free
globally supersymmetric theories, such as the NMSSM with a scale-invariant
superpotential, can be naturally embedded into this class of theories. After
the supergravity embedding, the Jordan frame scalar potential of such theories
remains scale free; it is quartic, it contains no mass terms, no
nonrenormalizable terms, no cosmological constant. The local superconformal
symmetry can be broken by additional terms, which, in the small field limit,
are suppressed by the gravitational coupling. This can be achieved by
introducing the nonminimal scalar-curvature coupling, and by taking into
account interactions with a hidden sector. In this approach, the smallness of
the mass parameters in the NMSSM may be traced back to the original
superconformal invariance. This allows to address the \mu-problem and the
cosmological domain wall problem in this model, and to implement chaotic
inflation in the NMSSM. We discuss the gravitino problem in the NMSSM
inflation, as well as the possibility to obtain a broad class of new versions
of chaotic inflation in supergravity.

boundary transport coefficients such as electrical conductivity (at vanishing
chemical potential), shear viscosity etc. at low frequency and finite
temperature can be expressed in terms of geometrical quantities evaluated at
the horizon. In the case of electrical conductivity, at zero chemical potential
gauge field fluctuation and metric fluctuation decouples, resulting in a
trivial flow from horizon to boundary. In the presence of chemical potential,
the story becomes complicated due to the fact that gauge field and metric
fluctuation can no longer be decoupled. This results in a nontrivial flow from
horizon to boundary. Though horizon conductivity can be expressed in terms of
geometrical quantities evaluated at the horizon, there exist no such neat
result for electrical conductivity at the boundary. In this paper we propose an
expression for boundary conductivity expressed in terms of geometrical
quantities evaluated at the horizon and thermodynamical quantities. We also
consider the theory at finite cutoff outside the horizon (arXiv:1006.1902) and
give an expression for cutoff dependent electrical conductivity, which
interpolates smoothly between horizon conductivity and boundary conductivity .
Using the results about the electrical conductivity we gain much insight into
the universality of thermal conductivity to viscosity ratio proposed in

long-range interactions strongly hinders theoretical studies. This makes a
quantum simulator for long-range models highly desirable. Here, we show that a
chain of trapped ions can be used to quantum simulate a one-dimensional model
of hard-core bosons with dipolar off-site interaction and tunneling, equivalent
to a dipolar XXZ spin-1/2 chain. We explore the rich phase diagram of this
model in detail, employing perturbative mean-field theory, exact
diagonalization, and quasiexact numerical techniques (density-matrix
renormalization group and infinite time evolving block decimation). We find
that the complete devil's staircase -- an infinite sequence of crystal states
existing at vanishing tunneling -- spreads to a succession of lobes similar to
the Mott-lobes found in Bose--Hubbard models. Investigating the melting of
these crystal states at increased tunneling, we do not find (contrary to
similar two-dimensional models) clear indications of supersolid behavior in the
region around the melting transition. However, we find that inside the
insulating lobes there are quasi-long range (algebraic) correlations, opposed
to models with nearest-neighbor tunneling which show exponential decay of

inferred physical conditions are similar for the three intrinsic N V absorbers,
with metallicities greater than 10 times the solar value (assuming a solar
abundance pattern), and with high ionization parameters (log U ~ 0). Thus, we
conclude that the unusual strength of the N V lines results from a combination
of partial coverage, a high ionization state, and high metallicity. We consider
whether dilution of the absorption lines by flux from the broad-emission line
region can lead us to overestimate the metallicities and we find that this is
an unlikely possibility. The high abundances that we infer are not surprising
in the context of scenarios in which metal enrichment takes place very early on
in massive galaxies. We estimate that the mass outflow rate in the absorbing
gas (which is likely to have a filamentary structure) is less than a few solar
masses per year under the most optimistic assumptions, although it may be
embedded in a much hotter, more massive outflow.

for leading singularities to the full amplitude. It also provides a new
physical picture for the meaning of loops, associated with canonical operations
for removing particles in a Yangian-invariant way. Loop amplitudes arise from
the ""entangled"" removal of pairs of particles, and are naturally presented as
an integral over lines in momentum-twistor space. As expected from manifest
Yangian-invariance, the integrand is given as a sum over non-local terms,
rather than the familiar decomposition in terms of local scalar integrals with
rational coefficients. Knowing the integrands explicitly, it is straightforward
to express them in local forms if desired; this turns out to be done most
naturally using a novel basis of chiral, tensor integrals written in
momentum-twistor space, each of which has unit leading singularities. As simple
illustrative examples, we present a number of new multi-loop results written in

LSPM 1459+0857AB, confirmed through common proper motion and spectroscopy. The
white dwarf is a high proper motion object from the LSPM catalogue that we
confirm spectroscopically to be a relatively cool (Teff=5535+\-45K) and
magnetic (B~2MG) hydrogen-rich white dwarf, with an age of at least 4.8Gyrs.
The T dwarf is a recent discovery from the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey (ULAS
1459+0857), and has a spectral type of T4.5+\-0.5 and a distance in the range
43-69pc. With an age constraint (inferred from the white dwarf) of >4.8Gyrs we
estimate Teff=1200-1500K and logg=5.4-5.5 for ULAS 1459+0857, making it a
benchmark T dwarf with well constrained surface gravity. We also compare the T
dwarf spectra with the latest LYON group atmospheric model predictions, which
despite some shortcomings are in general agreement with the observed properties
of ULAS 1459+0857. The separation of the binary components (16,500-26,500AU, or
365 arcseconds on the sky) is consistent with an evolved version of the more
common brown dwarf + main-sequence binary systems now known, and although the
system has a wide separation, it is shown to be statistically robust as a non
spurious association. The observed colours of the T dwarf show that it is
relatively bright in the z band compared to other T dwarfs of similar type, and
further investigation is warranted to explore the possibility that this could
be a more generic indicator of older T dwarfs. Future observations of this
binary system will provide even stronger constraints on the T dwarf properties,
and additional systems will combine to give a more comprehensively robust test
of the model atmospheres in this temperature regime.

from black-hole-binary systems is to connect post-Newtonian (PN) and
numerical-relativity (NR) results to create ""hybrid"" waveforms. Hybrid
waveforms are central to the construction of some phenomenological models for
GW search templates, and for tests of GW search pipelines. The dominant error
source in hybrid waveforms arises from the PN contribution, and can be reduced
by increasing the number of NR GW cycles that are included in the hybrid.
Hybrid waveforms are considered sufficiently accurate for GW detection if their
mismatch error is below 3% (i.e., a fitting factor about 0.97). We address the
question of the length requirements of NR waveforms such that the final hybrid
waveforms meet this requirement, considering nonspinning binaries with q =
M_2/M_1 \in [1,4] and equal-mass binaries with \chi = S_i/M_i^2 \in [-0.5,0.5].
We conclude that for the cases we study simulations must contain between three
(in the equal-mass nonspinning case) and ten (the \chi = 0.5 case) orbits
before merger, but there is also evidence that these are the regions of
parameter space for which the least number of cycles will be needed.

Because both passive and dusty galaxies can appear red in optical colors, we

populations from galaxies that are reddened by dust. As with the overall galaxy
population, ~25% of the `red' AGN host galaxies and ~75% of the `green' AGN

aging to the red sequence. At z~1, AGN activity is roughly evenly split between
two modes of black hole growth: the first in passively evolving host galaxies,
which may be heating up the galaxy's gas and preventing future episodes of star
formation, and the second in dust-reddened young galaxies, which may be
ionizing the galaxy's interstellar medium and shutting down star formation.

frictionless convex nonoverlapping (hard) particles in Euclidean spaces and for
that purpose it stresses individual-packing geometric analysis. A fundamental
feature of that diversity is the necessity to classify individual jammed
configurations according to whether they are locally, collectively, or strictly
jammed. Each of these categories contains a multitude of jammed configurations
spanning a wide and (in the large system limit) continuous range of intensive
properties, including packing fraction $\phi$, mean contact number $Z$, and
several scalar order metrics. Application of these analytical tools to spheres
in three dimensions (an analog to the venerable Ising model) covers a myriad of
jammed states, including maximally dense packings (as Kepler conjectured),
low-density strictly-jammed tunneled crystals, and a substantial family of
amorphous packings. With respect to the last of these, the current approach
displaces the historically prominent but ambiguous idea of ``random close
packing"" (RCP) with the precise concept of ``maximally random jamming"" (MRJ).
This review also covers recent advances in understanding jammed packings of
polydisperse sphere mixtures, as well as convex nonspherical particles, e.g.,
ellipsoids, ``superballs"", and polyhedra. Because of their relevance to
error-correcting codes and information theory, sphere packings in
high-dimensional Euclidean spaces have been included as well. We also make some
remarks about packings in (curved) non-Euclidean spaces. In closing this
review, several basic open questions for future research to consider have been
identified.

late-type-disk and spheroidal galaxies. The formation of NSCs is inevitable in
the context of normal star formation in which a majority of stars form in
clusters. A young, mass-losing cluster embedded in an isolated star-forming
galaxy remains gravitationally bound over a period determined by its initial
mass and the galactic tidal field. The cluster migrates radially toward the
center of the galaxy and becomes integrated in the NSC if it reaches the
center. The rate at which the NSC grows by accreting young clusters can be
estimated from empirical cluster formation rates and dissolution times. We
model cluster migration and dissolution and find that the NSCs in late-type
disks and in spheroidals could have assembled from migrating clusters. The
resulting stellar nucleus contains a small fraction of the stellar mass of the
galaxy; this fraction is sensitive to the high-mass truncation of the initial
cluster mass function (ICMF). The resulting NSC masses are consistent with the
observed values, but generically, the final NSCs are surrounded by a spatially
more extended excess over the inward-extrapolated exponential (or Sersic) law
of the outer galaxy. We suggest that the excess can be related to the
pseudobulge phenomenon in disks, though not all of the pseudobulge mass
assembles this way. Comparison with observed NSC masses can be used to
constrain the truncation mass scale of the ICMF and the fraction of clusters
suffering prompt dissolution. We infer truncation mass scales of <~ 10^6 M_sun
(>~ 10^5 M_sun) without (with 90%) prompt dissolution.

which was determined by main-sequence photometry. In this method, the age of a
cluster is obtained by fitting its CMD with stellar evolutionary models.
However, different stellar evolutionary models use different parameters of
stellar evolution, such as range of stellar masses, different opacities and
equations of state, and different recipes, and so on. So, it is interesting to
check whether different stellar evolutionary models can give consistent results
for the same cluster. Brown et al. (2004a) constrained the age of B379 by
comparing its CMD with isochrones of the 2006 VandenBerg models. Using SSP
models of BC03 and its multi-photometry, Ma et al. (2007) independently
determined the age of B379, which is in good agreement with the determination
of Brown et al. (2004a). The BC03 models are calculated based on the Padova
evolutionary tracks. It is necessary to check whether the age of B379 which,
being determined based on the Padova evolutionary tracks, is in agreement with
the determination of Brown et al. (2004a). So, in this paper, we re-determine
its age using isochrones of the Padova stellar evolutionary models. In
addition, the metal abundance, the distance modulus, and the reddening value
for B379 are also determined in this paper. The results obtained in this paper
are consistent with the previous determinations, which including the age
obtained by Brown et al. (2004a). So, this paper confirms the consistence of
the age scale of B379 between the Padova isochrones and the 2006 VandenBerg
isochrones, i.e. the results' comparison between Brown et al. (2004a) and Ma et
al. (2007) is meaningful. The results obtained in this paper are: the
metallicity [M/H]=-0.325, the age $\tau=11.0\pm1.5$ Gyr, the reddening value

criterion has well-documented merits in various applications, where
perturbations appear both in the data vector as well as in the regression
matrix. However, existing TLS approaches do not account for sparsity possibly
present in the unknown vector of regression coefficients. On the other hand,
sparsity is the key attribute exploited by modern compressive sampling and
variable selection approaches to linear regression, which include noise in the
data, but do not account for perturbations in the regression matrix. The
present paper fills this gap by formulating and solving TLS optimization
problems under sparsity constraints. Near-optimum and reduced-complexity
suboptimum sparse (S-) TLS algorithms are developed to address the perturbed
compressive sampling (and the related dictionary learning) challenge, when
there is a mismatch between the true and adopted bases over which the unknown
vector is sparse. The novel S-TLS schemes also allow for perturbations in the
regression matrix of the least-absolute selection and shrinkage selection
operator (Lasso), and endow TLS approaches with ability to cope with sparse,
under-determined ""errors-in-variables"" models. Interesting generalizations can
further exploit prior knowledge on the perturbations to obtain novel weighted
and structured S-TLS solvers. Analysis and simulations demonstrate the
practical impact of S-TLS in calibrating the mismatch effects of contemporary
grid-based approaches to cognitive radio sensing, and robust
direction-of-arrival estimation using antenna arrays.

  of thirteen alloying elements in bcc Fe","Submitted to Journal of Nuclear Materials",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Proposed as blanket structural materials for fusion power reactors, reduced
activation ferritic/martensitic (RAFM) steel undergoes volume expanding and
contracting in a cyclic mode under service environment. Particularly, being
subjected to significant fluxes of fusion neutrons RAFM steel suffers
considerable local volume variations in the radiation damage involved regions.
It is necessary to study the structure properties of the alloying elements in
contraction and expansion states. In this paper we studied local substitution
structures of thirteen alloying elements Al, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Mo, Nb, Ni, Si,
Ta, Ti, V, and W in bcc Fe and calculated their substitutional energies in the
volume variation range from -1.0% to 1.0%. From the structure relaxation
results of the first five neighbor shells around the substitutional atom we
find the relaxation in each neighbor shell keeps approximately uniform within
the volume variation from -1.0% to 1.0% except those of Mn and the relaxation
of the fifth neighbor shell is stronger than that of the third and forth,
indicating that the lattice distortion due to the substitution atom is easier
to spread in <111> direction than in other direction. The relaxation pattern
and intensity are related to the size and electron structure of the
substitutional atom. For some alloying elements, such as Mo, Nb, Ni, Ta, Ti and
W, the substitutional energy decreases noticeably when the volume increases.
Further analysis show that the substitutional energy comprises the energy
variation originated from local structure relaxation and the chemical potential
difference of the substitutional atom between its elemental crystalline state
and the solid solution phase in bcc Fe. We think the approximately uniform
relaxation of each neighbor shell around a substitutional atom give rise to a
linear decrease in the substitutional energy with the increasing volume.

is similar to the previously studied cases, in the sense that the solutions
quickly converge to a quasi-steady state. For large gaps ($\gtrsim 0.05$ MeV),
these solutions become unstable, leading to a limit-cycle behavior of

However, there have been few studies on runs, except for those on klinotaxis
(also called weathervane mechanism), in which the worm gradually curves toward
the direction with a high concentration of chemicals; this phenomenon was
discovered recently. We analyzed the data of runs by excluding sharp turns. We
show that the curving rate obeys long-tail distributions, which implies that
large curving rates are relatively frequent. This result holds true for
locomotion in environments both with and without a gradient of NaCl
concentration; it is independent of klinotaxis. We propose a phenomenological

The assumption of multiplicative noise posits that the fluctuation of the force

between two P+ poly gates) and having different gate oxide thicknesses
(increasing from source side to drain side). The different gate oxide thickness
serves the purpose of simultaneously achieving (i) a good gate control on the
channel charge and (ii) a lesser gate to drain capacitance. As a result, we
obtain higher transconductance as well as reduced switching delays, making the
proposed device suitable for both RF amplification and high speed switching
applications. In addition, the sandwiched gate with different work function
gate materials modifies the electric field profile in the channel resulting in
an improved breakdown voltage. Using two-dimensional simulations, we have shown
that the proposed device structure exhibits about 32% enhancement in breakdown
voltage, 25% reduction in switching delays, 20% enhancement in peak
transconductance and 10% reduction in figure of merit (product of ON-resistance
and gate charge) as compared to the conventional trench gate MOSFET.

derived. The equations that describe the electromagnetic processes in a plasma
surrounding a neutron star are obtained by using the general relativistic form
of Maxwell equations in a geometry of slow rotating gravitational object. In
addition to the general-relativistic effect first discussed by Khanna \&
Camenzind (1996) we predict a mechanism of the generation of azimuthal current
under the general relativistic effect of dragging of inertial frames on radial
current in a plasma around neutron star. The azimuthal current being
proportional to the angular velocity $\omega$ of the dragging of inertial
frames can give valuable contribution on the evolution of the stellar magnetic
field if $\omega$ exceeds $2.7\times 10^{17} (n/\sigma) \textrm{s}^{-1}$ ($n$
is the number density of the charged particles, $\sigma$ is the conductivity of
plasma). Thus in general relativity a rotating neutron star, embedded in
plasma, can in principle generate axial-symmetric magnetic fields even in
axisymmetry. However, classical Cowling's antidynamo theorem, according to
which a stationary axial-symmetric magnetic field can not be sustained against
ohmic diffusion, has to be hold in the general-relativistic case for the

especially if one can guide the extrapolations to the extremes regions of

Isospin extrapolations may be constrained in the laboratory by measuring the
neutron skin thickness of a heavy nucleus, such as 208Pb. Similarly, future
observations of massive neutron stars will constrain the extrapolations to the
high-density domain. In this contribution we introduce a new relativistic
effective interaction that is simultaneously constrained by the properties of
finite nuclei, their collective excitations, and neutron-star properties. By
adjusting two of the empirical parameters of the theory, one can efficiently
tune the neutron skin thickness of 208Pb and the maximum neutron star mass. We
illustrate this procedure in response to the recent interpretation of X-ray
observations by Steiner, Lattimer, and Brown that suggests that the FSUGold
effective interaction predicts neutron star radii that are too large and a
maximum stellar mass that is too small. The new effective interaction is fitted
to a neutron skin thickness in 208Pb of only R_n - R_p = 0.16 fm and a
moderately large maximum neutron star mass of 1.94 Msun.

exploiting a single crystal monochromator, which is extremely compact and can
be straightforwardly installed in the LCLS baseline undulator. We present
simulation results dealing with the LCLS hard X-ray FEL, and show that this
method can produce fully-coherent X-ray pulses at 100 GW power level. With the
radiation beam monochromatized down to the Fourier transform limit, a variety
of very different techniques leading to further improvements of the LCLS
performance become feasible. In particular, we describe an efficient way for
obtaining full polarization control at the LCLS hard X-ray FEL. We also propose
to exploit crystals in the Bragg reflection geometry as movable deflectors for
the LCLS X-ray transport systems. The hard X-ray beam can be deflected of an
angle of order of a radian without perturbations. The monochromatization of the
output radiation constitutes the key for reaching such result. Finally, we
describe a new optical pump - hard X-ray probe technique which will allow
time-resolved studies at the LCLS baseline on the femtosecond time scale. The
principle of operation of the proposed scheme is essentially based on the use
of the time jitter between pump and probe pulses. This eliminates the need for

of the Araucaria Project, the reported distance is tied to an assumed LMC

between room temperature and 1403 K. The study was aimed at resolving previous
uncertainties regarding the nature of the paraelectric- ferroelectric
transition and the possibilities of any secondary structural transitions. We
observe a clear transition at 1258 +/- 14 K corresponding to a unit cell
tripling and a change in space group from centrosymmetric P6_3/mmc to polar
P6_3cm. Despite the fact that this symmetry permits ferroelectricity, our
experimental data for this transition analysed in terms of symmetry-adapted
displacement modes clearly supports previous theoretical analysis that the
transition is driven primarily by the antiferrodistortive K3 mode. We therefore
verify previous suggestions that YMnO3 is an improper ferrielectric.
Furthermore, our data confirm that the previously suggested intermediate phase
with space group P6_3/mcm does not occur. However, we do find evidence for an
isosymmetric phase transition (i.e. P6_3cm to P6_3cm) at ~920 K which involves
a sharp decrease in polarization. This secondary transition correlates well
with several previous reports of anomalies in physical properties in this
temperature region and may be related to Y-O hybridization.

galaxies. We assume that the disk origins and grows by continuous gas infall.
The gas infall rate is parametrized by the Gaussian formula with one free
parameter: infall-peak time $t_p$. The Kennicutt star formation law is adopted
to describe how much cold gas turns into stars. The gas outflow process is also
considered in our model. We find that, at given galactic stellar mass $M_*$,
model adopting late infall-peak time $t_p$ results in blue colors, low
metallicity, high specific star formation rate and high gas fraction, while gas
outflow rate mainly influences the gas-phase metallicity and star formation
efficiency mainly influences the gas fraction. Motivated by the local observed
scaling relations, we construct a mass-dependent model by assuming low mass
galaxy has later infall-peak time $t_p$ and larger gas outflow rate than
massive systems. It is shown that this model can be in agreement with not only
the local observations, but also the observed correlations between specific
star formation rate and galactic stellar mass $SFR/M_* \sim M_*$ at
intermediate redshift $z<1$. Comparison between the Gaussian-infall model and
exponential-infall model is also presented. It shows that the
exponential-infall model predicts higher star formation rate at early stage and
lower star formation rate later than that of Gaussian-infall. Our results
suggest that the Gaussian infall rate may be more reasonable to describe the
gas cooling process than the exponential infall rate, especially for low-mass
systems.

model with a fairly satisfactory match to surface brightness and density

relatively steep initial mass function for stars above about turnoff, with an
index of about 2.8 (where the Salpeter mass function has an index of 2.35), and
a relatively flat initial mass function (index about 0.4) for the lower main

coupled Hookean-type bead-spring chain models that arise from the kinetic
theory of dilute solutions of polymeric liquids with noninteracting polymer
chains. The class of models involves the unsteady incompressible Navier-Stokes
equations in a bounded domain in two or three space dimensions for the velocity
and the pressure of the fluid, with an elastic extra-stress tensor appearing on
the right-hand side in the momentum equation. The extra-stress tensor stems
from the random movement of the polymer chains and is defined by the Kramers
expression through the associated probability density function that satisfies a
Fokker-Planck-type parabolic equation, a crucial feature of which is the
presence of a center-of-mass diffusion term. We require no structural
assumptions on the drag term in the Fokker-Planck equation; in particular, the
drag term need not be corotational. With a square-integrable and
divergence-free initial velocity datum for the Navier-Stokes equation and a
nonnegative initial probability density function for the Fokker-Planck
equation, which has finite relative entropy with respect to the Maxwellian of
the model, we prove the existence of a global-in-time weak solution to the
coupled Navier-Stokes-Fokker-Planck system. It is also shown that in the
absence of a body force, the weak solution decays exponentially in time to the
equilibrium solution, at a rate that is independent of the choice of the
initial datum and of the centre-of-mass diffusion coefficient.

attention. In this paper, we are interested in deriving the asymptotic
distributions of the test statistics of the EBD algorithms. Two EBD algorithms
using sample covariance matrices are considered: maximum eigenvalue detection
(MED) and condition number detection (CND). The earlier studies usually assume
that the number of antennas (K) and the number of samples (N) are both large,
thus random matrix theory (RMT) can be used to derive the asymptotic
distributions of the maximum and minimum eigenvalues of the sample covariance
matrices. While assuming the number of antennas being large simplifies the
derivations, in practice, the number of antennas equipped at a single secondary
user is usually small, say 2 or 3, and once designed, this antenna number is
fixed. Thus in this paper, our objective is to derive the asymptotic

matrices for any fixed K but large N, from which the probability of detection
and probability of false alarm can be obtained. The proposed methodology can

polynomials, and that if f(x) is a product of m>1 irreducible polynomials, then
its Galois group must be ""m-coverable"", i.e. a union of conjugates of m proper
subgroups, whose total intersection is trivial. We are thus led to a variant of
the inverse Galois problem: given an m-coverable finite group G, find a Galois
realization of G over the rationals Q by a polynomial f(x) in Z[x] which is a
product of m nonlinear irreducible factors (in Q[x]) such that f(x) has a root
in Q_p for all p. The minimal value m=2 is of special interest. It is known
that the symmetric group S_n is 2-coverable if and only if 2<n<7, and the
alternating group A_n is 2-coverable if and only if 3<n<9. In this paper we
solve the above variant of the inverse Galois problem for the 2-coverable
symmetric and alternating groups, and exhibit an explicit polynomial for each
group, with the help of the software packages MAGMA, PARI and GAP.

nonetheless repel a complementary nearby set of initial conditions. For a given
invariant set $X\subset\R^n$ with a basin of attraction $N$, we define a
stability index $\sigma(x)$ of a point $x\in X$ that characterizes the local
extent of the basin. Let $B_{\epsilon}$ denote a ball of radius $\epsilon$
about $x$. If $\sigma(x)>0$, then the measure of $B_{\epsilon}\setminus N$
relative the measure of the ball is $O(\epsilon^{|\sigma(x)|})$, while if
$\sigma(x)<0$, then the measure of $B_{\epsilon}\cap N$ relative the measure of
the ball is of the same order. We show that this index is constant along
trajectories, and relate this orbit invariant to other notions of stability
such as Milnor attraction, essential asymptotic stability and asymptotic
stability relative to a positive measure set. We adapt the definition to local
basins of attraction (i.e. where $N$ is defined as the set of initial
conditions that are in the basin and whose trajectories remain local to $X$).
This stability index is particularly useful for discussing the stability of
robust heteroclinic cycles, where several authors have studied the appearance
of cusps of instability near cycles that are Milnor attractors. We study simple
(robust heteroclinic) cycles in $\R^4$ and show that the local stability
indices (and hence local stability properties) can be calculated in terms of
the eigenvalues of the linearization of the vector field at steady states on
the cycle. In doing this, we extend previous results of Krupa and Melbourne
(1995,2004) and give criteria for simple heteroclinic cycles in $\R^4$ to be
Milnor attractors.

associated with the accretion of a massive satellite (~ 10^9 solar masses). The
metal-poor population may characterise the primordial stellar halo and the net
retrograde rotation could then reflect an underestimate in our adopted local
standard of rest circular velocity Theta_0. If Theta_0 is ~ 240 km/s then the
metal-poor component has no rotation and there is a net prograde rotation
signal of ~45 km/s in the metal-rich component. There is reasonable evidence
that the Milky Way globular cluster and satellite galaxy systems are rotating
with <v_phi> ~50 km/s and <v_phi> ~ 40 km/s respectively. Furthermore, a
stronger signal is found for the satellite galaxies when the angular momentum
vector of the satellites is inclined with respect to the normal of the disc.

corresponding to Higgs mass $M_H \sim 100, 150, 270$ GeV. It has been found
that nonperturbative effects become important while approaching continuum
physics within the lattice model. When the ultraviolet cutoff $\Lambda =
\frac{\pi}{a}$ (where $a$ is the lattice spacing) is increased and achieves the
value around 1 TeV one encounters the fluctuational region (on the phase
diagram of the lattice model), where the fluctuations of the scalar field
become strong. The classical Nambu monopole can be considered as an embryo of
the unphysical symmetric phase within the physical phase. In the fluctuational
region quantum Nambu monopoles are dense and, therefore, the use of the
perturbation expansion around trivial vacuum in this region is limited. Further
increase of the cutoff is accompanied by a transition to the region of the
phase diagram, where the scalar field is not condensed (this happens at the
value of $\Lambda$ around 1.4 TeV for the considered lattice sizes). Within
this region further increase of the cutoff is possible although we do not
observe this in details due to the strong fluctuations of the gauge boson
correlator. Both mentioned above regions look unphysical. Therefore we come to
the conclusion that the maximal value of the cutoff admitted within lattice
Electroweak theory cannot exceed the value of the order of 1 TeV.

flux qubit coupled to the LC resonator. For the initial Bell state with
anti-correlated spins, the entanglement sudden death (ESD) is absent in the

Aperiodic entanglement evolution in the strong coupling regime is observed. The
strong atom-cavity coupling facilitates the ESD. The sign of detuning play a
essential role in the entanglement evolution for strong coupling, which is
irrelevant in the RWA. An analytical results based on an unitary transformation

have cophased down to 0.22 nm rms in optical path difference (OPD) and 60 mas
rms in tip/tilt, and have obtained a monochromatic null of 3E-5 stabilized at
3E-6. The goal of 1 nm with additional typical satellite disturbances requires
the use of an optimal control law; that is why we elaborated a dedicated Kalman
filter. Simulations and experiments show a good rejection of disturbances.
Performance of the bench should be enhanced by using a Kalman control law, and
we should be able to reach the desired nanometric stability. Following, we will
present the first results of the final polychromatic configuration, which
includes an achromatic phase shifter, perturbators and optical delay lines. As
a conclusion, we give the first more general lessons we have already learned
from this experiment, both at system and component levels for a future space
mission.

bursts at regular intervals of ~12 yr during the last ~ 40 yr. Due to this
behavior, it has been suggested that OJ287 might host a close supermassive
binary black hole. We present optical photopolarimetric monitoring data from
2005-2009, during which the latest double-peaked outburst occurred. We find a
stable component in the optical jet: the optical polarization core. The optical
polarization indicates that the magnetic field is oriented parallel to the jet.
Using historical optical polarization data, we trace the evolution of the
optical polarization core and find that it has showed a swing in the Stokes
plane indicating a reorientation of the jet magnetic field. We also find that
changes in the optical jet magnetic field seem tightly related to the
double-peaked bursts. We use our findings as a new constraint on possible
binary black hole models. Combining all available observations, we find that
none of the proposed binary black bole models is able to fully explain the
observations. We suggest a new approach to understanding OJ287 that is based on
the assumption that changes in the jet magnetic field drive the regular
outbursts.

information, a process which must crucially depend on the mechanisms of social
interaction. Consumers choosing which product to buy, or voters deciding which
option to take respect to an important issues, typically confront external
signals to the information gathered from their contacts. Received economic
models typically predict that correct social learning occurs in large
populations unless some individuals display unbounded influence. We challenge
this conclusion by showing that an intuitive threshold process of individual
adjustment does not always lead to such social learning. We find, specifically,
that three generic regimes exist. And only in one of them, where the threshold
is within a suitable intermediate range, the population learns the correct
information. In the other two, where the threshold is either too high or too
low, the system either freezes or enters into persistent flux, respectively.
These regimes are generally observed in different social networks (both complex
or regular), but limited interaction is found to promote correct learning by
enlarging the parameter region where it occurs.

energy depending on the asymptotic ratio between the characteristic length
scale of the phase transition and the thickness of the film. In each case, the
interfacial energy is determined by an explicit optimal profile problem. This
asymptotic problem entails a nontrivial dependance on the thickness direction

it shows a separation of scales if the thin film is created at a faster rate
than the phase transition. The last regime, when the phase transition is
created at a faster rate than the thin film, is more involved. Depending on
growth conditions of the potential and the compatibility of the two phases, we
either obtain a sharp interface model with scale separation, or a trivial
situation driven by rigidity effects.

resistivity yields a weak electron-phonon coupling constant lambda_ph ~ 0.2.
The low-frequency optical response in the normal state appears to be dominated
by the electron pocket and may be described by a weakly-interacting Fermi
liquid with a Drude plasma frequency of omega_p,D ~ 7840 cm-1 (~ 0.972 eV) and
scattering rate 1/tau_D ~ 125 cm-1 (~ 15 meV) just above Tc. The
frequency-dependent scattering rate 1/tau(omega) has kinks at ~ 12 and 55 meV
that appear to be related to bosonic excitations. Below Tc the majority of the
superconducting plasma frequency originates from the electron pocket and is
estimated to be omega_p,S ~ 5200 cm-1 (lambda0 ~ 3000 Angstroms) for T << Tc,
indicating that less than half the free carriers in the normal state have
collapsed into the condensate, suggesting that this material is not in the
clean limit. Supporting this finding is the observation that this material
falls close to the universal scaling line for a BCS dirty-limit superconductor
in the weak-coupling limit. There are two energy scales for the
superconductivity in the optical conductivity and photo-induced reflectivity at
Delta1 ~ 3.1 +/- 0.2 meV and Delta2 ~ 7.4 +/- 0.3 meV. This corresponds to
either the gaping of the electron and hole pockets, respectively, or an

over a wide kinematic range. We identified spectator correlated pp and pn
nucleon pairs using kinematic cuts and measured their relative and total
momentum distributions. This is the first measurement of the ratio of pp to pn
pairs as a function of pair total momentum, $p_{tot}$. For pair relative
momenta between 0.3 and 0.5 GeV/c, the ratio is very small at low $p_{tot}$ and
rises to approximately 0.5 at large $p_{tot}$. This shows the dominance of
tensor over central correlations at this relative momentum.

Britto-Cachazo-Feng-Witten (BCFW) tree level on-shell recursion relations to
integrands and integrals of scattering amplitudes to arbitrary loop order.
Surprisingly, it is shown that the large BCFW shift limit of the integrands has
the same structure as the corresponding tree level amplitude in any minimally
coupled Yang-Mills theory in four or more dimensions. This implies that these
integrands can be reconstructed from a subset of their `single cuts'. The main
tool is powercounting Feynman graphs in a special lightcone gauge choice
employed earlier at tree level by Arkani-Hamed and Kaplan. The relation between
shifts of integrands and shifts of its integrals is investigated explicitly at
one loop. Two particular sources of discrepancy between the integral and
integrand are identified related to UV and IR divergences. This is
cross-checked with known results for helicity equal amplitudes at one loop. The
nature of the on-shell residue at each of the single-cut singularities of the
integrand is commented upon. Several natural conjectures and opportunities for
further research present themselves.

It is found that the low-T thermal conductivity (\kappa) shows very strong
magnetic-field dependence, with the strongest suppression of nearly 90% and the
biggest increase of 20 times of \kappa compared to its zero-field value. In
particular, some ``dip""-like features show up in \kappa(H) isotherms for field
along both the ab plane and the c axis. These behaviors are found to shed new
light on the complex H-T phase diagram and the field-induced re-orientations of
Mn^{3+} and Ho^{3+} spin structures. The results also demonstrate a significant
spin-phonon coupling in this multiferroic compound.

a sum of cost functions from the language and the goal is to minimise the sum.
We are interested in \emph{tractable} constraint languages; that is, languages
that give rise to VCSP instances solvable in polynomial time. Cohen et al.
(AIJ'06) have shown that constraint languages that admit the MJN multimorphism

functions, Cohen et al. (TCS'08) have shown that constraint languages that
admit an STP (symmetric tournament pair) multimorphism are tractable.

clusters of galaxies is yet to be fully unveiled. X-ray cavities blown by the
central Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) contain enough energy to heat the
surrounding gas and stop cooling, but locally blobs or filaments of gas appear
to be able to cool to low temperatures of 10^4 K. In X-rays, however, gas with
temperatures lower than 0.5 keV is not observed. Using a deep XMM-Newton
observation of the cluster of galaxies Abell 2052, we derive 2D maps of the
temperature, entropy, and iron abundance in the core region. About 130 kpc
South-West of the central galaxy, we discover a discontinuity in the surface
brightness of the hot gas which is consistent with a cold front. Interestingly,
the iron abundance jumps from ~0.75 to ~0.5 across the front. In a smaller
region to the North-West of the central galaxy we find a relatively high
contribution of cool 0.5 keV gas, but no X-ray emitting gas is detected below
that temperature. However, the region appears to be associated with much cooler
H-alpha filaments in the optical waveband. The elliptical shape of the cold
front in the SW of the cluster suggests that the front is caused by sloshing of
the hot gas in the clusters gravitational potential. This effect is probably an
important mechanism to transport metals from the core region to the outer parts
of the cluster. The smooth temperature profile across the sharp jump in the
metalicity indicates the presence of heat conduction and the lack of mixing
across the discontinuity. The cool blob of gas NW of the central galaxy was
probably pushed away from the core and squeezed by the adjacent bubble, where
it can cool efficiently and relatively undisturbed by the AGN. Shock induced
mixing between the two phases may cause the 0.5 keV gas to cool non-radiatively
and explain our non-detection of gas below 0.5 keV.

spherically symmetric thin-shell wormholes with a ""phantom-like"" equation of
state for the exotic matter at the throat: $P=\omega\sigma$, $\omega<0$, where
$\sigma$ is the energy-density of the shell and $P$ the surface pressure. This
equation is analogous to the generalized Chaplygin-gas equation of state used
by E.F. Eiroa. The analysis, which differes from Eiroa's in its basic approach,
is carried out for wormholes constructed from the following spacetimes:
Schwarzschild, de Sitter and anti de Sitter, Reissner-Nordstrom, and regular
charged black-hole spacetimes, as well as from black holes in dilaton and
generalized dilaton-axion gravity.

applicability of competitive accretion to explain the high-mass end of the
stellar initial mass function in a sheet geometry with shallow gravitational
potential, in contrast to most previous simulations which have assumed
formation in a cluster gravitational potential. Our flat cloud geometry is
motivated by models of molecular cloud formation due to large-scale flows in
the interstellar medium. The experiments consisted of SPH simulations of gas
accretion onto sink particles formed rapidly from Jeans-unstable dense clumps
placed randomly in the finite sheet. These simplifications allow us to study
accretion with a minimum of free parameters, and to develop better statistics
on the resulting mass spectra. We considered both clumps of equal mass and
gaussian distributions of masses, and either uniform or spatially-varying gas
densities. In all cases, the sink mass function develops a power law tail at
high masses, with $dN/dlog M \propto M^{-\Gamma}$. The accretion rates of
individual sinks follow $\dot{M} \propto M^2$ at high masses; this results in a
continual flattening of the slope of the mass function towards an asymptotic
form $\Gamma \sim 1$ (where the Salpeter slope is $\Gamma = 1.35$). The
asymptotic limit is most rapidly reached when starting from a relatively broad
distribution of initial sink masses. In general the resulting upper mass slope
is correlated with the maximum sink mass; higher sink masses are found in
simulations with flatter upper mass slopes. Although these simulations are of a
highly idealized situation, the results suggest that competitive accretion may
be relevant in a wider variety of environments than previously considered, and
in particular that the upper mass distribution may generally evolve towards a
limiting value of $\Gamma \sim 1$.
