these spectral synthesis models and FIR/optical diagnostics, most of them seem
to be obscured galaxies whose spectra are AGN-dominated. From the analysis of
the optical data, we have observed a fraction of AGN or composite over source
total number of ~0.75 in the LAE population at z~2.2, which is marginally
consistent with the fraction previously observed at z=2.25 and even at low
redshift (0.2<z<0.45), but significantly different from the one observed at
redshift ~3, which could be compatible either with a scenario of rapid change
in the AGN fraction between the epochs involved or with a non detection of
obscured AGN in other z=2-3 LAE samples due to lack of deep FIR observations.
We found three robust FIR (PACS) counterparts at z~2.2 in GOODS-North. This

properties of B stars. We derive the projected rotational velocity $V\sin i$,
effective temperature, gravity, mass, and critical rotation speed $V_{\rm
crit}$ for each star. We find that the average $V\sin i$ is significantly lower
among field stars because they are systematically more evolved and spun down
than their cluster counterparts. The rotational distribution functions of
$V_{\rm eq}/V_{\rm crit}$ for the least evolved B stars show that lower mass B
stars are born with a larger proportion of rapid rotators than higher mass B
stars. However, the upper limit of $V_{\rm eq}/V_{\rm crit}$ that may separate
normal B stars from emission line Be stars (where rotation promotes mass loss
into a circumstellar disk) is smaller among the higher mass B stars. We compare
the evolutionary trends of rotation (measured according to the polar gravity of
the star) with recent models that treat internal mixing. The spin-down rates
observed in the high mass subset ($\sim 9 M_\odot$) agree with predictions, but
the rates are larger for the low mass group ($\sim 3 M_\odot$). The faster spin
down in the low mass B stars matches well with the predictions based on
conservation of angular momentum in individual spherical shells. Our results
suggest the fastest rotators (that probably correspond to the emission line Be
stars) are probably formed by evolutionary spin up (for the more massive stars)
and by mass transfer in binaries (for the full range of B star masses).

using images obtained by the Cassini ISS narrow-angle camera. We find no
evidence for any such material, contradicting an earlier and surprising
inference that Rhea, the second-largest moon of Saturn, possesses a system of
narrow rings embedded in a broad circum-satellite disk or cloud (Jones et al.
2008, Science). If one accepts the calculations of the previous authors, our
results would require any narrow rings around Rhea to be composed of objects no
smaller than 10 meters in radius, in order to be massive enough to account for
the observed charged-particle absorptions but diffuse enough to evade detection
in our images. Such a particle-size distribution is unrealistic given that
erosion processes will break down 10-meter objects to smaller sizes, which
would then have been seen in our images. Furthermore, Jones et al. (2008)
assumed that the absorption of electrons by hypothetical circum-Rhea particles
is proportional to the volume of the particles, even when they are much larger
than the electron penetration depth (van Allen 1983, 1987, JGR). If we assume
instead that large particles can only absorb electrons efficiently near their
surfaces, then our results rule out any solid material orbiting Rhea as the
explanation for the absorptions detected by Jones et al. (2008), regardless of
particle size, by a margin of four (for narrow rings) or two (for a broad
diffuse cloud) orders of magnitude. We conclude that the anomalous electron
absorptions reported by Jones et al. (2008) are the signature of a new and
hitherto unknown magnetospheric process.

superconducting (SC) state without sign reversal (s_{++}-wave state) is induced
by orbital fluctuations by using realistic model parameters. The virtue of the
present theory is that the famous empirical relation between Tc and the
As-Fe-As bond angle is automatically explained, since the electron-phonon
(e-ph) coupling that creates the orbital fluctuations is the strongest when the
As$_4$-tetrahedron is regular. The negative iron isotope effect is also
reproduced. In addition, the magnitude of the SC gap on hole-pockets is
predicted to be rather insensitive to the corresponding d-orbital (xz/yz- or
z^2-orbital), which is consistent with the recent bulk-sensitive angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurement for (Ba,K)Fe$_2$As$_2$ and

soft decode-and-forward (soft-DF) for relay channels, and soft partial
interference-cancelation (soft-IC) for interference channels. Both strategies
involve soft estimation, which assists the decoding process. We consider LDPC
codes, not because of their practical benefits, but because of their analytic
tractability, which enables an asymptotic analysis similar to random coding
methods of information theory. Unlike some works on the closely-related
demodulate-and-forward, we assume non-memoryless, code-structure-aware
estimation. With soft-DF, we develop {\it simultaneous density evolution} to
bound the decoding error probability at the destination. This result applies to
erasure relay channels. In one variant of soft-DF, the relay applies Wyner-Ziv
coding to enhance its communication with the destination, borrowing from
compress-and-forward. To analyze soft-IC, we adapt existing techniques for
iterative multiuser detection, and focus on binary-input additive white
Gaussian noise (BIAWGN) interference channels. We prove that optimal
point-to-point codes are unsuitable for soft-IC, as well as for all strategies
that apply partial decoding to improve upon single-user detection (SUD) and
multiuser detection (MUD), including Han-Kobayashi (HK).

  GPS based map",,,"10.5120/3039-4122",,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Handoff has become an essential criterion in mobile communication system,
specially in urban areas, owing to the limited coverage area of Access Points
(AP). Handover of calls between two Base Stations (BSs) is encountered
frequently and it is essentially required to minimize the delay of the process.
Many solutions attempting to improve this process have been proposed but only a
few use geo-location systems in the management of the handover. Here we propose
to minimize the handoff latency by minimizing the number of APs scanned by the
Mobile Node (MN) during each handoff procedure. We consider the whole
topographical area as a two dimensional plane. By GPS, we can note down the
co-ordinates of the MN at any instant. The average rate of change of its
latitudinal distance and longitudinal distance with a specific time period is
evaluated at the end of the given time period. With the knowledge of the given
parameter, it is possible to determine the latitude and longitude of the MN
after a particular instant of time. Hence, the direction of motion of the MN
can be determined, which in turns gives the AP towards which the MN is
headings. This reduces the number of APs to be scanned. Thus, on an overall
basis, the handoff latency can be reduced by almost half to one third of its
value.

embrace and do not embrace the solenoid. Due to this fact, one has to construct
two different kinds of CS/SS, which correspond to such trajectories in the
semiclassical limit. Following this idea, we construct CS in two steps, first
the instantaneous CS (ICS) and the time dependent CS/SS as an evolution of the
ICS. The construction is realized for nonrelativistic and relativistic spinning
particles both in (2+1)- and (3+1)- dimensions and gives a non-trivial example
of SS/CS for systems with a nonquadratic Hamiltonian. It is stressed that CS
depending on their parameters (quantum numbers) describe both pure quantum and

the CS in such respect. Such a classification is used for the semiclassical
decompositions of various physical quantities.

BiCu2PO6 using band structure calculations, magnetic susceptibility and

resulting quasi-one-dimensional spin model is a two-leg AFM ladder with
frustrating next-nearest-neighbor couplings along the legs. The individual
couplings are estimated from band structure calculations and by fitting the
magnetic susceptibility with theoretical predictions, obtained using ED. The
nearest-neighbor leg coupling J1, the rung coupling J4, and one of the
next-nearest-neighbor couplings J2 amount to 120-150 K, while the second
next-nearest-neighbor coupling is J2'~J2/2. The spin ladders do not match the
structural chains, and although the next-nearest-neighbor interactions J2 and
J2' have very similar superexchange pathways, they differ substantially in
magnitude due to a tiny difference in the O-O distances and in the arrangement
of non-magnetic PO4 tetrahedra. An extensive ED study of the proposed model
provides the low-energy excitation spectrum and shows that the system is in the
strong rung coupling regime. The strong frustration by the
next-nearest-neighbor couplings leads to a triplon branch with an
incommensurate minimum. This is further corroborated by a strong-coupling
expansion up to second order in the inter-rung coupling. Based on high-field
magnetization measurements, we estimate the spin gap of 32 K and suggest the
likely presence of antisymmetric DM anisotropy and inter-ladder coupling J3. We
also provide a tentative description of the physics of BiCu2PO6 in magnetic
field, in the light of the low-energy excitation spectra and numerical
calculations based on ED and DMRG. In particular, we raise the possibility for
a rich interplay between one- and two-component Luttinger liquid phases and a
magnetization plateau at 1/2 of the saturation value.

the visualization of large-scale electrically active defects which are the

of excess carriers within a small volume located in the probe mid-IR-laser beam
enabled the visualization of the large-scale recombination-active defects like

primarily composed of ~75 K crystalline, magnesium-rich olivine; ~75 K
crystalline, magnesium-rich pyroxene; ~200 K amorphous, magnesium-rich
pyroxene; and ~200 K annealed silica ('cristobalite'). These dust grains are
all sub-micron sized. The giant planet and gap model also naturally explains
the location and mineralogy of the small dust grains in the disk. Disk shocks
that result from disk-planet interaction generate the highly crystalline dust
which is subsequently blown out of the disk mid-plane and into the disk

results in quantum field theory on curved spacetimes from the well-known case
of the Klein-Gordon field to Dirac fields. To this end, the enlarged algebra of
observables of the Dirac field is constructed in the algebraic framework. This
algebra contains normal-ordered Wick polynomials in particular, and an extended
analysis of one of its elements, the stress-energy tensor, is performed. Based
on detailed calculations of the Hadamard coefficients of the Dirac field, it is
found that a construction of a stress-energy tensor fulfilling necessary
physical properties is possible. Additionally, the mathematically sound
Hadamard regularisation prescription of the stress-energy tensor is compared to
the mathematically less rigorous DeWitt-Schwinger regularisation and it is
found that both prescriptions are essentially equivalent in rigorous terms.
  While the aforementioned results hold in generic curved spacetimes,
particular attention is also devoted to a specific class of Robertson-Walker
spacetimes with a lightlike Big Bang hypersurface. Employing holographic
methods, Hadamard states for the Klein-Gordon and the Dirac field are
constructed. These states are preferred in the sense that they constitute
asymptotic equilibrium states in the limit to the Big Bang hypersurface.
Finally, solutions of the semiclassical Einstein equation for quantum fields of
arbitrary spin are analysed in the flat Robertson-Walker case. One finds that
these solutions explain the measured supernova Ia data as good as the $\La$CDM
model. Hence, one arrives at a natural explanation of dark energy and a simple
quantum model of cosmological dark matter.
  It is the hope of the author that the present thesis can serve as an
accessible introduction to the field of (algebraic) quantum field theory on
curved spacetimes and its recent developments.

matter, in particular when the dark matter is light. We analyze models where
the dark matter is a fermion or scalar interacting with quarks and/or gluons
through an effective theory containing higher dimensional operators which
represent heavier states that have been integrated out of the effective field
theory. We determine bounds from existing Tevatron searches for monojets as
well as expected LHC reaches for a discovery. We find that colliders can
provide information which is complementary or in some cases even superior to
experiments searching for direct detection of dark matter through its
scattering with nuclei. In particular, both the Tevatron and the LHC can
outperform spin dependent searches by an order of magnitude or better over much
of parameter space, and if the dark matter couples mainly to gluons, the LHC
can place bounds superior to any spin independent search.

galactic 511 keV gamma rays observed by INTEGRAL/SPI, the DAMA/LIBRA annual
modulation, and the excess of low-recoil dark matter candidates observed by
CoGeNT. It requires three nearly degenerate states of dark matter in the 4-7
GeV mass range, with splittings respectively of order an MeV and a few keV. The
top two states have the small mass gap and transitions between them, either
exothermic or endothermic, can account for direct detections. Decays from one
of the top states to the ground state produce low-energy positrons in the
galaxy whose associated 511 keV gamma rays are seen by INTEGRAL. This decay can
happen spontaneously, if the excited state is metastable (longer-lived than the
age of the universe), or it can be triggered by inelastic scattering of the
metastable states into the shorter-lived ones. We focus on a simple model where
the DM is a triplet of an SU(2) hidden sector gauge symmetry, broken at the
scale of a few GeV, giving masses of order \lsim 1 GeV to the dark gauge
bosons, which mix kinetically with the standard model hypercharge. The purely
decaying scenario can give the observed angular dependence of the 511 keV
signal with no positron diffusion, while the inelastic scattering mechanism
requires transport of the positrons over distances \sim 1 kpc before
annihilating. We note that an x-ray line of several keV in energy, due to
single-photon decays involving the top DM states, could provide an additional
component to the diffuse x-ray background. The model is testable by proposed
low-energy fixed target experiments.

the amounts of time and memory used. In proof complexity, these resources
correspond to the length and space of resolution proofs. There has been a long
line of research investigating these proof complexity measures, but while
strong results have been established for length, our understanding of space and
how it relates to length has remained quite poor. In particular, the question
whether resolution proofs can be optimized for length and space simultaneously,
or whether there are trade-offs between these two measures, has remained
essentially open.
  In this paper, we remedy this situation by proving a host of length-space
trade-off results for resolution. Our collection of trade-offs cover almost the
whole range of values for the space complexity of formulas, and most of the
trade-offs are superpolynomial or even exponential and essentially tight. Using
similar techniques, we show that these trade-offs in fact extend to the
exponentially stronger k-DNF resolution proof systems, which operate with
formulas in disjunctive normal form with terms of bounded arity k. We also
answer the open question whether the k-DNF resolution systems form a strict
hierarchy with respect to space in the affirmative.
  Our key technical contribution is the following, somewhat surprising,
theorem: Any CNF formula F can be transformed by simple variable substitution
into a new formula F' such that if F has the right properties, F' can be proven
in essentially the same length as F, whereas on the other hand the minimal
number of lines one needs to keep in memory simultaneously in any proof of F'
is lower-bounded by the minimal number of variables needed simultaneously in
any proof of F. Applying this theorem to so-called pebbling formulas defined in
terms of pebble games on directed acyclic graphs, we obtain our results.

comes from HI Ly-alpha and the strongest metal line, CIII, is about an order of
magnitude fainter, although HI Ly-alpha may be fainter if the gas is
self-shielded to the UV background or if dust is important. The highest surface
brightness regions for CIV, SiIII, SiIV and OVI are fainter than CIII by
factors of a few. The NV and NeVIII lines, as well as HeII H-alpha, are
substantially weaker but their maximum surface brightnesses still exceed 100
photon/cm^2/s/sr at z=2 (for 2"" pixels). Lower ionisation lines arise in denser
and colder gas that produces clumpier emission. The brightest HI Ly-alpha
emission arises in highly overdense gas, but the highest surface brightness
emission from high-ionisation metal lines traces a wider range of
overdensities. Bright metal-line emission traces gas with temperatures close to
the peak of the corresponding emissivity curve. While HI Ly-alpha, HeII
H-alpha, CIII, SiIII, and SiIV are excellent probes of cold accretion flows and
the colder parts of outflows, CIV, NV, OVI, and NeVIII are powerful tracers of
the diffuse WHIM and galactic winds. A comparison of results from simulations
with varying physical prescriptions demonstrates that the predictions for the
brighter metal-line emission are robust to within factors of a few. Several
emission lines from the high-redshift IGM will become detectable in the near

energy to which electrons are accelerated at the shock ranges from ~60-130 TeV
(B/10$\mu$G)^(-1/2), where B is the magnetic field in units of $\mu$G. For the
northern knot, we constrain previous models and find that a two-component
power-law (or srcut) + pshock model provides an adequate fit, with the pshock
model requiring a very low ionization timescale and solar abundances for Mg and
Si. Our spectroscopic study of J1833-1034, the highly energetic pulsar powering

emission with some evidence of a thermal component that represents ~9% of the

breaking that is safe from all flavor constraints. The central new idea is to
employ a supersymmetry breaking sector without singlets, but with D-terms
comparable to F-terms, causing supersymmetry breaking to be dominantly
communicated through U(1)_R-symmetric operators. We construct a visible sector
that is an extension of the MSSM where an \emph{accidental} U(1)_R symmetry
emerges naturally. Gauginos acquire Dirac masses from gravity-mediated D-terms,
and tiny Majorana masses from anomaly-mediated contributions. Contributions to
soft breaking scalar (mass)^2 arise from flavor-arbitrary gravity-induced
F-terms plus one-loop finite flavor-blind contributions from Dirac gaugino
masses. Renormalization group evolution of the gluino causes it to naturally
increase nearly an order of magnitude larger than the squark masses. This
hierarchy, combined with an accidentially U(1)_R-symmetric visible sector,
nearly eliminates all flavor violation constraints on the model. If we also
freely tune couplings and phases within the modest range 0.1-1, while
maintaining nearly flavor-anarchic Planck-suppression contributions, we find
our model to be safe from Delta m_K, epsilon_K, and mu -> e lepton flavor
violation. Dangerous U(1)_R-violating K\""ahler operators in the Higgs sector
are eliminated through a new gauged U(1)_X symmetry that is spontaneously
broken with electroweak symmetry breaking. Kinetic mixing between U(1)_X and
U(1)_Y is present with loop-suppressed (but log-enhanced) size epsilon. The Z'
associated with this U(1)_X has very peculiar couplings -- it has order one
strength to Higgs doublets and approximately epsilon strength to hypercharge.
The Z' could be remarkably light and yet have escaped direct and indirect

Nonetheless, our result shows that the (111)-surfaces of magnetic $\gamma$-Ce

predict, in contrast to the nonmagnetic $\alpha$-phase which tends to produce
magnetically ordered $\gamma$-like thin layers at its free surfaces, the
magnetic $\gamma$-phase has a tendency to form $\alpha$-like dead layers. This
study, which explains the suppressed (promoted) surface magnetic moments of
$\gamma$-Ce ($\alpha$-Ce), shows that how nanoscale can reverse physical
properties by going from bulk to the surface in isostructural $\alpha$- and
$\gamma$-phases of cerium. We predict using our freestanding surface results
that a typical unreactive and non-diffusive substrate can dramatically
influence the magnetic surface of cerium thin films in contrast to most of the
uncorrelated thin films and strongly correlated transition metals. Our result
implies that magnetic surface moments of $\alpha$-Ce(111) can be suddenly

transport in stably-stratified fluids. The most-studied natural manifestation
of this process, fingering convection, commonly occurs in the ocean's
thermocline and typically increases diapycnal mixing by two orders of magnitude
over molecular diffusion. Fingering convection is also often associated with
structures on much larger scales, such as thermohaline intrusions, gravity
waves and thermohaline staircases. In this paper, we present an exhaustive
study of the phenomenon from small to large scales. We perform the first
three-dimensional simulations of the process at realistic values of the heat
and salt diffusivities and provide accurate estimates of the induced turbulent
transport. Our results are consistent with oceanic field measurements of
diapycnal mixing in fingering regions. We then develop a generalized mean-field
theory to study the stability of fingering systems to large-scale
perturbations, using our calculated turbulent fluxes to parameterize
small-scale transport. The theory recovers the intrusive instability, the
collective instability, and the gamma-instability as limiting cases. We find
that the fastest-growing large-scale mode depends sensitively on the ratio of
the background gradients of temperature and salinity (the density ratio). While
only intrusive modes exist at high density ratios, the collective and
gamma-instabilities dominate the system at the low density ratios where
staircases are typically observed. We conclude by discussing our findings in
the context of staircase formation theory.

observed to host thermohaline staircases, stacks of deep well-mixed convective
layers separated by thin stably-stratified interfaces. Decades after their
discovery, however, their origin remains controversial. In this paper we use 3D
direct numerical simulations to shed light on the problem. We study the
evolution of an analogous double-diffusive system, starting from an initial
statistically homogeneous fingering state and find that it spontaneously
transforms into a layered state. By analysing our results in the light of the
mean-field theory developed in Paper I, a clear picture of the sequence of
events resulting in the staircase formation emerges. A collective instability
of homogeneous fingering convection first excites a field of gravity waves,
with a well-defined vertical wavelength. However, the waves saturate early
through regular but localized breaking events, and are not directly responsible
for the formation of the staircase. Meanwhile, slower-growing, horizontally
invariant but vertically quasi-periodic gamma-modes are also excited and grow
according to the gamma-instability mechanism. Our results suggest that the
nonlinear interaction between these various mean-field modes of instability
leads to the selection of one particular gamma-mode as the staircase
progenitor. Upon reaching a critical amplitude, this progenitor overturns into
a fully-formed staircase. We conclude by extending the results of our
simulations to real oceanic parameter values, and find that the progenitor
gamma-mode is expected to grow on a timescale of a few hours, and leads to the
formation of a thermohaline staircase in about one day with an initial spacing
of the order of one to two metres.

situ depletion, or the efficient depletion of Li in the pristine Galaxy by a
generation of massive first stars. The realm of possibilities may be narrowed
considerably by observing stellar populations in different galaxies, which have
experienced different evolutionary histories.
  The WCen stellar system is commonly considered as the remnant of a dwarf
galaxy accreted by the Milky Way (MW). We investigate the Li content of a
conspicuous sample of unevolved stars in this object.
  We obtained moderate resolution (R=17000) spectra for 91 main-sequence/early
sub-giant branch (MS/SGB) WCen stars using the FLAMES-GIRAFFE/VLT spectrograph.
Li abundances were derived by matching the equivalent width of the LiI
resonance doublet at 6708A, to the prediction of synthetic spectra computed
with different Li abundances. Synthetic spectra were computed using the SYNTHE
code along with ATLAS9 model atmospheres. The stars effective temperatures are
derived by fitting the wings of the Ha line with synthetic profiles.
  We obtain a mean content of A(Li)=2.19+-0.14~dex for WCen MS/SGB stars. This
is comparable to what is observed in Galactic halo field stars of similar
metallicities and temperatures.
  The Spite plateau seems to be an ubiquitous feature of old, warm metal-poor
stars. It exists also in external galaxies, if we accept the current view about
the origin of WCen. This implies that the mechanism(s) that causes the

SU(4) Kondo effect. We theoretically study the low-temperature properties and

Notable intensity and Doppler velocity oscillations were found for two moss

five apexes of loops. The amplitudes of the oscillations were 0.4 - 5.7% for

upwardly propagating and standing slowmode waves were found inmoss regions; and
(3) consistent with previous studies, estimated values of energy flux of the

is only an approximation to the game being played, in this work we analyze
equilibrium computation for the broad and natural class of bimatrix games that
are stable to perturbations. We specifically focus on games with the property
that small changes in the payoff matrices do not cause the Nash equilibria of
the game to fluctuate wildly. For such games we show how one can compute
approximate Nash equilibria more efficiently than the general result of Lipton
et al. \cite{LMM03}, by an amount that depends on the degree of stability of
the game and that reduces to their bound in the worst case. Furthermore, we
show that for stable games the approximate equilibria found will be close in
variation distance to true equilibria, and moreover this holds even if we are
given as input only a perturbation of the actual underlying stable game.
  For uniformly-stable games, where the equilibria fluctuate at most
quasi-linearly in the extent of the perturbation, we get a particularly
dramatic improvement. Here, we achieve a fully quasi-polynomial-time
approximation scheme: that is, we can find $1/\poly(n)$-approximate equilibria
in quasi-polynomial time. This is in marked contrast to the general class of
bimatrix games for which finding such approximate equilibria is PPAD-hard. In
particular, under the (widely believed) assumption that PPAD is not contained
in quasi-polynomial time, our results imply that such uniformly stable games
are inherently easier for computation of approximate equilibria than general
bimatrix games.

the former case, we characterize the network stability region and show that a
maximum-weight type scheduling policy is throughput-optimal. In the latter

an associated trade-off in average packet delay and convergence time, the

the 802.11-2007 standard falls short of proposing a reliable MAC-level recovery

efficient coding algorithm based on the principles of network coding for
retransmitting lost packets in a singlehop wireless multicast network and

"1008.1843","Qiqi Yan","Qiqi Yan","Mechanism Design via Correlation Gap",,,,,"cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For revenue and welfare maximization in single-dimensional Bayesian settings,
Chawla et al. (STOC10) recently showed that sequential posted-price mechanisms
(SPMs), though simple in form, can perform surprisingly well compared to the
optimal mechanisms. In this paper, we give a theoretical explanation of this
fact, based on a connection to the notion of correlation gap.
  Loosely speaking, for auction environments with matroid constraints, we can
relate the performance of a mechanism to the expectation of a monotone
submodular function over a random set. This random set corresponds to the
winner set for the optimal mechanism, which is highly correlated, and
corresponds to certain demand set for SPMs, which is independent. The notion of
correlation gap of Agrawal et al.\ (SODA10) quantifies how much we {}""lose"" in
the expectation of the function by ignoring correlation in the random set, and
hence bounds our loss in using certain SPM instead of the optimal mechanism.
Furthermore, the correlation gap of a monotone and submodular function is known
to be small, and it follows that certain SPM can approximate the optimal
mechanism by a good constant factor.
  Exploiting this connection, we give tight analysis of a greedy-based SPM of
Chawla et al.\ for several environments. In particular, we show that it gives
an $e/(e-1)$-approximation for matroid environments, gives asymptotically a
$1/(1-1/\sqrt{2\pi k})$-approximation for the important sub-case of $k$-unit
auctions, and gives a $(p+1)$-approximation for environments with
$p$-independent set system constraints.

sizes range from about 100 pc (our resolution limit) to about 2 kpc, their
expansion velocities range from 4 to 36 km/s, and their ages are estimated to
range between 3 and 150 Myr. The holes are found throughout the disks of the
galaxies, out to the edge of the HI; 23% of the holes fall outside R25. We find
that shear limits the age of holes in spirals (shear is less important in dwarf
galaxies) which explains why HI holes in dwarfs are rounder, on average than in
spirals. Shear, which is particularly strong in the inner part of spiral
galaxies, also explains why we find that holes outside R25 are larger and
older. We derive the scale height of the HI disk as a function of
galactocentric radius and find that the disk flares up in all galaxies. We
proceed to derive the surface and volume porosity (Q2D and Q3D) and find that
this correlates with the type of the host galaxy: later Hubble types tend to be
more porous. The size distribution of the holes in our sample follows a power
law with a slope of a ~ -2.9. Assuming that the holes are the result of massive
star formation, we derive values for the supernova rate (SNR) and star
formation rate (SFR) which scales with the SFR derived based on other tracers.
If we extrapolate the observed number of holes to include those that fall below
our resolution limit, down to holes created by a single supernova, we find that
our results are compatible with the hypothesis that HI holes result from star
formation.

Combining Lanczos diagonalization with Chebyshev moment expansion of the time

stationary ground states or injected wave packets, after an electron-phonon
interaction quench, develop in real space and time. Thereby, the full quantum
nature and dynamics of electrons and phonons is preserved. We find that the
decay out of the initial state sensitively depends on the energy and momentum
of the incoming particle, the electron-phonon coupling strength, and the phonon
frequency, whereupon bound polaron-phonon excited states may emerge in the
strong-coupling regime. The tunneling of a Holstein polaron through a quantum
wall/dot is generally accompanied by strong phonon number fluctuations due to
phonon emission and re-absorption processes.

discovery of the gluon, as members of the collaboration, we have reconsidered
all the material produced by it in 1978 and the first half of 1979. It results
clearly that the experiment demonstrated the main decay of the Y resonance to
be mediated by 3 gluons hadronizing into 3 jets. Jettiness resulted evident by
the <P_T> with respect to the thrust axis, which was as observed by PLUTO
itself at nearby continuum c.m.s. energies for 2-quark jet events. Instead, the
average sphericity <S>, more topological variables and the momentum
distribution showed a net difference with the same data, results compatible
with jettiness only in case of more than 2 jets. Flatness as consequence of a
3-body decay (therefore 3 jets) was indicated by the low <P_out>, altogether a
result independent of models. The charged multiplicity was observed to be
larger than in the continuum and in case of MC 3 gluon jets fragmenting like
quarks, as expected for gluon jets. In June 1979 PLUTO measured the matrix
element of the 3-gluon decay to be quantitatively according QCD (even after
hadronization, which does not obscure the perturbative predictions) and
demonstrated the spin 1 nature of the gluon by excluding spin 0 and spin 1/2.
The gluon hadronization like a quark jet, as in 3-gluon jet MC, was compatible
with topological data and multiplicity; this was the first experimental study
of (identified) gluon jets. The PLUTO results were confirmed both by other
experiments at DORIS and later by more sophisticated detectors. At higher
energies at PETRA the existence of gluons of spin 1 was confirmed by PLUTO and
by 3 more experiments by measuring the gluon radiation, soft gluons by jet
broadening, hard gluons by the emission of (now clearly visible) gluon jets by
quarks.

order to measure the 12C/13C isotopic ratio. We observe 9 positions selected

locations where the X1 and X2 orbits associated with the barred potential are

We find a systematically higher 12C/13C isotopic ratio (>40) toward the halo

results point out to molecular gas which has undergone a different degree of

the disc is thought to influence the rotational evolution of the star, while
magnetised stellar winds control the braking of more evolved stars and may
influence the migration of planets. Magnetic reconnection events trigger
energetic flares which irradiate circumstellar discs with high energy particles
that influence the disc chemistry and set the initial conditions for planet
formation. However, it is only in the past few years that the current
generation of optical spectropolarimeters have allowed the magnetic fields of

Recent theoretical works suggest that these constraints can have a significant
impact and should not be neglected. However, it is not yet resolved how
stoichiometry should be integrated in population dynamical models, as different
modeling approaches are found to yield qualitatively different results. Here we
investigate a unifying framework that reveals the differences and commonalities
between previously proposed models for producer-grazer systems. Our analysis
reveals that stoichiometric constraints affect the dynamics mainly by
increasing the intraspecific competition between producers and by introducing a
variable biomass conversion efficiency. The intraspecific competition has a
strongly stabilizing effect on the system, whereas the variable conversion
efficiency resulting from a variable food quality is the main determinant for
the nature of the instability once destabilization occurs. Only if the food
quality is high an oscillatory instability, as in the classical paradox of
enrichment, can occur. While the generalized model reveals that the generic
insights remain valid in a large class of models, we show that other details
such as the specific sequence of bifurcations encountered in enrichment
scenarios can depend sensitively on assumptions made in modeling stoichiometric
constraints.

using weak coupling renormalization group as well as strong coupling expansion.
For spinless fermions and assuming parabolic degeneracy, there are
4-independent four-fermion contact couplings. While the dominant instability
depends on the microscopic values of the couplings, the broken symmetry state
is typically a gapped insulator with either broken inversion symmetry or broken
time reversal symmetry, with a quantized anomalous Hall effect. Under certain
conditions, the dominant instability may appear in the particle-particle
(pairing) channel. For some non-generic fine-tuned initial conditions, weak
coupling RG trajectories flow into the non-interacting fixed point, although
generally we find runaway flows which we associate with ordering tendencies.
Additionally, a tight binding model with nearest neighbor hopping and nearest
neighbor repulsion is studied in weak and strong couplings and in each regime a
gapped phase with inversion symmetry breaking is found. In the strong coupling
limit, the ground state wavefunction is constructed for vanishing in-plane
hopping but finite inter-plane hopping, which explicitly displays the broken
inversion symmetry and a finite difference between the number of particles on
the two layers. Finally, we discuss the spin-1/2 case and use Fierz identities
to show that the number of independent 4-fermion contact couplings is 9. The
corresponding RG equations in the spin-1/2 case are also presented, and used to
show that, just as in strong coupling, the most dominant weak coupling

to detect active voxels in single-subject experiments or to detect regions that
differ between individuals belonging to different groups. In order to bound the
probability of a false discovery of pair-wise differences, a Bonferroni or
other correction for multiplicity is necessary. These corrections greatly
reduce the power of the comparisons which means that small signals
(differences) remain hidden and therefore have been more or less successful
depending on the application. We introduce a method that improves the power of
a family of correlated statistical tests by reducing their number in an orderly
fashion using our a-priori understanding of the problem . The tests are grouped
by blocks that respect the data structure and only one or a few tests per group
are performed. For each block we construct an appropriate summary statistic
that characterizes a meaningful feature of the block. The comparisons are based
on these summary statistics by a block-wise approach. We contrast this method
with the one based on the individual measures in terms of power. Finally, we
apply the method to compare brain connectivity matrices. Although the method is
used in this study on the particular case of imaging, the proposed strategy can
be applied to a large variety of problems that involves multiple comparisons
when the tests can be grouped according to attributes that depend on the
specific problem. Keywords and phrases: Multiple comparisons ; Family-wise

classical zero-point radiation of inertial frames is transformed over to the
coordinates of a Rindler frame. Although for zero-point radiation the two-field
correlation function at different spatial points at a single time is the same
between inertial and Rindler frames, the correlation function at two different

extension to non-zero temperature. The thermal spectrum in the Rindler frame is

both the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the search space get large, where the
search space may grow exponentially as a function of SNR. Simulations assuming
a Gaussian peak shape and a Gaussian autocorrelation function show that desired
error levels are achieved for relatively low SNR and are robust to partial peak
overlap. Simulations also show that detection power is maximized when the
smoothing bandwidth is close to the bandwidth of the signal peaks, akin to the

equilibrium regime for a large class of renormalizable interaction
configurations involving a two-stage mechanism, where a background scalar field
is coupled to heavy intermediate scalar or fermion fields which in turn are
coupled to light scalar or fermion radiation fields. These interactions are
typical of warm inflation microscopic model building. Two perturbative regimes
are shown where well defined approximations for the spectral functions apply.
One regime is at high temperature, when the masses of both intermediate and
radiation fields are less than the temperature scale and where the poles of the
spectral functions dominate. The other regime is at low temperature, when the
intermediate field masses are much bigger than the temperature and where the
low energy and low three-momentum regime dominate the spectral functions. The
dissipation coefficients in these two regimes are derived. However, due to
resummation issues for the high temperature case, only phenomenological
approximate estimates are provided for the dissipation in this regime. In the
low temperature case, higher loop contributions are suppressed and so no
resummation is necessary. In addition to inflationary cosmology, the
application of our results to cosmological phase transitions is also discussed.

polynomials has recently attracted a lot of attention. Helton and Vinnikov have
proved that any real zero polynomial in two variables has a determinantal

arbitrary numbers of variables, disproving the generalized Lax conjecture. We
prove that in fact almost no real zero polynomial admits a determinantal
representation; there are dimensional differences between the two sets. So the
generalized Lax conjecture fails badly. The result follows from a general upper
bound on the size of linear matrix polynomials. We then provide a large class
of surprisingly simple explicit real zero polynomials that do not have a
determinantal representation, improving upon Br\""and\'en's mostly
unconstructive result. We finally characterize polynomials of which some power
has a determinantal representation, in terms of an algebra with involution
having a finite dimensional representation. We use the characterization to
prove that any quadratic real zero polynomial has a determinantal
representation, after taking a high enough power. Taking powers is thereby
really necessary in general. The representations emerge explicitly, and we
characterize them up to unitary equivalence.

different modes of transcription factor binding to complex promoters

described by the smoothness parameter $\alpha$ which is defined as the
proportion of matter in the form of intergalactic medium. If we take
consideration of the inhomogeneities in small scale, there should be
modifications of the cosmological distances compared to a homogenous model.
Dyer and Roeder developed a second-order ordinary differential equation (D-R
equation) that describes the angular diameter distance-redshift relation for
inhomogeneous cosmological models. Furthermore, we may obtain the D-R equation
for observational $H(z)$ data (OHD). The density-parameter $\Omega_{\rm M}$,
the state of dark energy $\omega$, and the smoothness-parameter $\alpha$ are
constrained by a set of OHD in a spatially flat $\Lambda$CDM universe as well
as a spatially flat XCDM universe. By using of $\chi^2$ minimization method we
get $\alpha=0.81^{+0.19}_{-0.20}$ and $\Omega_{\rm M}=0.32^{+0.12}_{-0.06}$ at
$1\sigma$ confidence level. If we assume a Gaussian prior of $\Omega_{\rm
M}=0.26\pm0.1$, we get $\alpha=0.93^{+0.07}_{-0.19}$ and $\Omega_{\rm

$\alpha\geq0.80$ but $\omega$ is weakly constrained around -1, where $\omega$
describes the equation of the state of the dark energy ($p_{\rm

respect to the influence on hydrodynamic Lyapunov modes (HLMs). Our numerical
simulations show that in both Hamiltonian and dissipative systems HLMs formerly
detected via OLVs survive if CLVs are used instead. Moreover the previous
classification of two universality classes works for CLVs as well, i.e. the
dispersion relation is linear for Hamiltonian systems and quadratic for
dissipative systems respectively. The significance of HLMs changes in different
ways for Hamiltonian and dissipative systems with the replacement of OLVs by
CLVs. For general dissipative systems with nonhyperbolic dynamics the long wave
length structure in Lyapunov vectors corresponding to near-zero Lyapunov
exponents is strongly reduced if CLVs are used instead, whereas for highly
hyperbolic dissipative systems the significance of HLMs is nearly identical for
CLVs and OLVs. In contrast the HLM significance of Hamiltonian systems is
always comparable for CLVs and OLVs irrespective of hyperbolicity. We also find
that in Hamiltonian systems different symmetry relations between conjugate
pairs are observed for CLVs and OLVs. Especially, CLVs in a conjugate pair are
statistically indistinguishable in consequence of the micro- reversibility of
Hamiltonian systems. Transformation properties of Lyapunov exponents, CLVs and
hyperbolicity under changes of coordinate are discussed in appendices.

when there are gravitational fields at the same time. In the description with
the algebra of octonions, the inferences of wave equations are identical with
that in conventional electromagnetic theory with vector terminology. By means
of the octonion exponential function, we can draw out that the electromagnetic
waves are transverse waves in a vacuum, and rephrase the law of reflection,
Snell's law, Fresnel formula, and total internal reflection etc. The study
claims that the theoretical results of wave equations for electromagnetic
strength keep unchanged in the case for coexistence of gravitational and
electromagnetic fields. Meanwhile the electric and magnetic components of
electromagnetic waves can not be determined simultaneously in electromagnetic
fields.

  increasing complexity","12 pages, 6 figures",,,,"physics.gen-ph physics.geo-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper is a continuation of our 2005 paper on complex topology and its
implication on invertibility (or non-invertibility). In this paper, we will try
to classify the complexity of inversion into 3 different classes. We will use
synthetic models based on well control to illustrate the different classes. The
first class is systems which have a group of symmetry. This class has clean
inversion. We will use two examples which include 2-term AVO on 1-D layers as
an example. The second class does not have a group support. It is in general
described by a semigroup which is a set of operators with or without inverses.
There is no guarantee in general of invertibility in a global sense. Even
though this class does not have invertibility in general, there could still be
local weak invertibility embedded in the semigroup. The last class is system
with complex topology where the underlying topology/geometry requires infinite
construction. In our previous 2005 paper, we gave the 1-D Cantor layers as the
forerunner of all complex topological interface. We will re-examine this last
class in detail. The idea of constructing the Cantor layers as inverse limit
was introduced in the previous paper. We will examine the finite approximation
of the Cantor layers and its implication on inversion.
