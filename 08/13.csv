an effective quark-meson model. We investigate the transition between
infinite-volume and finite-volume scaling behavior when the system is placed in
a finite box. We can estimate effects that the finite volume and the explicit
symmetry breaking by the current quark masses have on the scaling behavior
which is observed in full QCD lattice simulations. The model allows us to
explore large quark masses as well as the chiral limit in a wide range of
volumes, and extract information about the scaling regimes.In particular, we
find large scaling deviations for physical pion masses and significant finite
volume effects for pion masses that are used in current lattice simulations.

widespread soft excess observed in the X-ray spectra of type 1 active galactic
nuclei (AGN). In particular, reflection from the photoionized accretion disc
blurred by relativistic effects has proven to be successful in reproducing both
the spectral shape and the variability pattern of many sources. As a further
test to this scenario we present the analysis of a recent ~100 ks long Suzaku
observation of Arakelian 120, a prototypical 'bare' Seyfert 1 galaxy in which
no complex absorption system is expected to mimic a soft excess or mask the
intrinsic properties of this key component. We show that a reflection model
allowing for both warm/blurred and cold/distant reprocessing provides a
self-consistent and convincing interpretation of the broadband X-ray emission
of Ark 120, also characterized by a structured iron feature and a high-energy
hump. Although warm absorbers, winds/outflows and multiple Comptonizing regions
may play significant roles in sources with more spectral complexity, this case
study adds evidence to the presence of blurred disc reflection as a basic
component of the X-ray spectra of type 1 AGN.

specific X-ray luminosities L_{X} > 2.35 x 10^{43} erg s^{-1} at 0.4 < z < 3.
We calculate the Eddington limiting masses of the supermassive black holes
residing at the centre of these galaxies, and observe an increase in the
average Eddington limiting black hole mass with redshift. By assuming that
there is no evolution in the Eddington ratio (\mu) and then that there is
maximum possible evolution to the Eddington limit, we quantify the maximum
possible evolution in the M_{*} / M_{BH} ratio as lying in the range 700 <
M_{*}/M_{BH} < 10000, compared with the local value of M_{*}/M_{BH} ~ 1000. We
furthermore find that the fraction of galaxies which are AGN (with L_{X} > 2.35
x 10^{43} erg s^{-1}) rises with redshift from 1.2 +/- 0.2 % at z = 0.7 to 7.4
+/- 2.0 % at z = 2.5. We use our results to calculate the maximum timescales
for which our sample of AGN can continue to accrete at their observed rates
before surpassing the local galaxy-black hole mass relation. We use these
timescales to calculate the total fraction of massive galaxies which will be
active (with L_{X} > 2.35 x 10^{43} erg s^{-1}) since z = 3, finding that at
least ~ 40% of all massive galaxies will be Seyfert luminosity AGN or brighter
during this epoch. Further, we calculate the energy density due to AGN activity
in the Universe as 1.0 (+/- 0.3) x 10^{57} erg Mpc^{-3} Gyr^{-1}, potentially
providing a significant source of energy for AGN feedback on star formation. We
also use this method to compute the evolution in the X-ray luminosity density
of AGN with redshift, finding that massive galaxy Seyfert luminosity AGN are
the dominant source of X-ray emission in the Universe at z < 3.

since the inclinations of the moon orbits are sizeable (9 deg and 18 deg with
respect to the equator of the primary respectively). No resonances, neither
secular nor due to Lidov-Kozai mechanism, were detected in our dynamical
solution, suggesting that these inclinations are not due to excitation modes
between the primary and the moons. A 10-year evolution study shows that the
orbits are slightly affected by perturbations from the Sun, and to a lesser
extent by mutual interactions between the moons. The estimated J2 of the
primary is three times lower than the theoretical one, calculated assuming the

$G_n=(\Z_2)^n$. With the help of $G_n$-colored graphs (or mod 2 GKM graphs), we

$G_n$-equivariant unoriented bordism class of each $n$-dimensional 2-torus
manifold contains an $n$-dimensional small cover as its representative, solving
the conjecture posed in [19]. In addition, we also obtain that the graded
noncommutative ring formed by the equivariant unoriented bordism classes of
2-torus manifolds of all possible dimensions is generated by the classes of all
generalized real Bott manifolds (as special small covers over the products of
simplices). This gives a strong connection between the computation of

small covers. As a computational application, with the help of computer, we
completely determine the structure of the group formed by equivariant bordism

double-lobed radio galaxies and ghost sources, and their observable
distribution in the X-ray sky. We develop an analytic model for the evolution
of the lobe emission at radio and X-ray energies. During jet activity, a double
radio source emits synchrotron radiation in the radio and X-ray emission due to
inverse-Compton (IC) upscattering by gamma~10^3 electrons of the cosmic
microwave background. After the jets switch off, the radio luminosity (due to
higher gamma electrons) falls faster than the X-ray luminosity and for some
time the source appears as an IC ghost of a radio galaxy before becoming
completely undetectable in the X-ray. With our model, for one set of typical
parameters, we predict radio lobes occupy a volume fraction of the universe of
0.01, 0.03, 0.3 at z=2 (during the quasar era) of the filamentary structures in
which they are situated, for typical jet lifetimes 5*10^7 yr, 10^8 yr, 5*10^8
yr; however since the inferred abundance of sources depends on how quickly they
fall below the radio flux limit the volume filling factor is found to be a
strong function of radio galaxy properties such as energy index and minimum
gamma factor of injected particles, the latter not well constrained by
observations. We test the predicted number density of sources against the
Chandra X-ray Deep Field North survey and also find the contribution to the
unresolved cosmic X-ray background by the lobes of radio galaxies. 10-30 per
cent of observable double-lobed structures in the X-ray are predicted to be IC

that double-lobed sources have higher space densities than X-ray clusters at
redshifts z>2 and X-ray luminosities above 10^44 erg s^-1.

dwarfs, with the known census described by q^(4.9+/-0.7). However, such systems
can test the joint accuracy of evolutionary and atmospheric models, under the
constraint of coevality (the ""isochrone test''). We carry out this test using
two of the most extreme field substellar binaries currently known, the T1+T6
\eps Ind Bab binary and a newly discovered 0.14"" T2.0+T7.5 binary, 2MASS
1209-10AB. Based on the locations of the components on the H-R diagram, models
successfully indicate that the systems are coeval, with internal age
differences of log(age) = 0.5{+0.4}{-0.3} and -0.8+/-1.3 dex, respectively.
However, the total mass of \eps Ind Bab derived from the H-R diagram (~80 Mjup)
is discrepant with the reported dynamical mass. This problem, which is
independent of the assumed age of the system, can be explained by a ~50-100 K
systematic error in the model atmosphere fitting; bringing the two mass
determinations into consistency leads to an inferred age of ~6 Gyr for the \eps
Ind system, older than previously assumed. Overall, the two T dwarf binaries
studied here, along with recent results from T dwarfs in age and mass benchmark
systems, yield evidence for small (~100 K) errors in the evolutionary models
and/or model atmospheres, but not significantly larger. Finally, the binary
nature of 2MASS 1209-10AB reduces its utility as the primary T3 near-IR
spectral typing standard; we suggest SDSS 1206+28 as a replacement.

relatively large cross section of these absorbers together with the frequent

instabilities in our simulations and dynamically adapts to the individual

reduces the variations in the coordinate size of the apparent horizon of the

spectra of slowly rotating sun-like stars. To this end, we apply the LTE
spectral line inversion package SPINOR to very-high quality CES data and
explore how fit quality depends on the average magnetic field, Bf .
One-component (OC) and two-component (TC) models are adopted. In OC models, the
entire surface is assumed to be magnetic. Under this assumption, we determine
formal 3{\sigma} upper limits on the average magnetic field of 200 G for the
Sun, and 150 G for 61 Vir (G6V). Evidence for an average magnetic field of ~
500 G is found for 59 Vir (G0V), and of ~ 1000 G for HD 68456 (F6V). A
distinction between magnetic and non-magnetic regions is made in TC models,
while assuming a homogeneous distribution of both components. In our TC
inversions of 59 Vir, we investigate three cases: both components have equal
temperatures; warm magnetic regions; cool magnetic regions. Our TC model with
equal temperatures does not yield significant improvement over OC inversions
for 59 Vir. The resulting Bf values are consistent for both. Fit quality is
significantly improved, however, by using two components of different
temperatures. The inversions for 59 Vir that assume different temperatures for
the two components yield results consistent with 0 - 450 G at the formal
3{\sigma} confidence level. We thus find a model dependence of our analysis and
demonstrate that the influence of an additional temperature component can
dominate over the Zeeman broadening signature, at least in optical data.
Previous comparable analyses that neglected effects due to multiple temperature
components may be prone to the same ambiguities.

numerical model output to help fill space-time gaps between traditional
observations. Such output is often a noisy proxy for the process of interest.
Thus one needs to separate and assess the signal and noise (often called
discrepancy) in the proxy given complicated spatio-temporal dependencies. Here
I extend a popular two-likelihood hierarchical model using a more flexible
representation for the discrepancy. I employ the little-used Markov random
field approximation to a thin plate spline, which can capture small-scale
discrepancy in a computationally efficient manner while better modeling smooth
processes than standard conditional auto-regressive models. The increased
flexibility reduces identifiability, but the lack of identifiability is
inherent in the scientific context. I model particulate matter air pollution
using satellite aerosol and atmospheric model output proxies. The estimated
discrepancies occur at a variety of spatial scales, with small-scale
discrepancy particularly important. The examples indicate little predictive
improvement over modeling the observations alone. Similarly, in simulations
with an informative proxy, the presence of discrepancy and resulting
identifiability issues prevent improvement in prediction. The results highlight
but do not resolve the critical question of how best to use proxy information
while minimizing the potential for proxy-induced error.

autocorrelation function analysis, we investigate the variability of Sgr A* on
time scales ranging from a few seconds to several hours and find evidence for
sub-minute time scale variability at radio wavelengths. These measurements
suggest a strong case for continuous variability from sub-minute to hourly time
scales. This short time scale variability constrains the size of the emitting
region to be less than 0.1\,AU. Assuming that the minute time scale
fluctuations of the emission at 7\,mm arise through the expansion of regions of
optically thick synchrotron-emitting plasma, this suggests the presence of
explosive, energetic expansion events at speeds close to $c$. The required rate
of mass processing and energy loss of this component are estimated to be $\ga
6\times 10^{-10} \msol$ yr$^{-1}$ and 400\,$L_\odot$ respectively. The inferred
scale length corresponding to one-minute light travel time is comparable to the
time averaged spatially resolved 0.1AU scale observed at 1.3mm emission of Sgr
A*. This steady component from Sgr A* is interpreted mainly as an ensemble
average of numerous weak and overlapping flares that are detected on short time
scales. The nature of such short time scale variable emission or quiescent
variability is not understood but could result from fluctuations in the

resonance whose energy is dictated by the particle spectrum in the dark matter
sector (neutralino and selectron for the case of supersymmetry, Kaluza-Klein

characteristic spectral feature, consisting of a sharp break to a hard

protein complex and phycocyanin 645 (PC 645) to explore the general dependence
on physical parameters that help maximize the efficiency and maintain its
stability. With the Haken-Strobl model, the maximal energy transfer efficiency
(ETE) is achieved under an intermediate optimal value of dephasing rate. To
avoid the infinite temperature assumption in the Haken-Strobl model and the
failure of the Redfield equation in predicting the Forster rate behavior, we
use the generalized Bloch-Redfield (GBR) equation approach to correctly
describe dissipative exciton dynamics and find that maximal ETE can be achieved
under various physical conditions, including temperature, reorganization
energy, and spatial-temporal correlations in noise. We also identify regimes of
reorganization energy where the ETE changes monotonically with temperature or
spatial correlation and therefore cannot be optimized with respect to these two
variables.

(PN) detections and PN velocity measurements in the flattened elliptical galaxy
NGC 821. A comparison with the detections reported previously by the Planetary
Nebula Spectrograph (PN.S) group indicates that we have confirmed most of their
detections. The velocities measured by the two groups, using different
telescopes, spectrographs and slitless techniques, are in good agreement. We
have built a combined sample of 167 PNs and have confirmed the keplerian
decline of the line-of-sight velocity dispersion reported previously. We also
confirm misaligned rotation from the combined sample. A dark matter halo may
exist around this galaxy, but it is not needed to keep the PN velocities below
the local escape velocity as calculated from the visible mass. We have measured
the m(5007) magnitudes of 145 PNs and produced a statistically complete sample
of 40 PNs in NGC 821. The resulting PN luminosity function (PNLF) was used to
estimate a distance modulus of 31.4 mag, equivalent to 19 Mpc. We also
estimated the PN formation rate. NGC 821 becomes the most distant galaxy with a
PNLF distance determination. The PNLF distance modulus is smaller than the
surface brightness fluctuation (SBF) distance modulus by 0.4 mag. Our kinematic
information permits to rule out the idea that a shorter PNLF distance could be
produced by the contamination of the PNLF by background galaxies with emission
lines redshifted into the on-band filter transmission curve.

This presents a new method for measuring galactic and extragalactic gamma-ray
background above 1 TeV energy. Preliminary results based on this method are
reported here. Primary aim is to explore the possibility of using data recorded
by a single imaging atmospheric Cerenkov telescope(IACT) for making accurate
measurements of diffuse galactic and extragalactic gamma-ray flux above ~1 TeV
energy. Using simulated data of atmospheric Cerenkov images recorded in an
IACT, initiated both by cosmic ray protons and diffuse gamma-rays with energies
above 4 TeV and 2 TeV respectively, we identify the most efficient fractal
/wavelet parameters of the recorded images for primary identification. The
method is based on the pattern recognition technique and employs fractal and
wavelet analysis of the recorded Cerenkov images for gamma-hadron segregation.
We show that the value of wavelet dimension parameter B6 can segregate Cerenkov
images of hadronic origin from those of diffuse gamma-ray origin with almost
100% accuracy. We use the results to get a preliminary upper limit estimate of

find that at ""large"" scales of > 1"" (700 AU) the main regions of maser emission

the masers have been relatively stable during that time span. However, at
smaller scales of < 0.1"" (70 AU) we see large changes in the maser structures,
particularly in the expanding arcuate structures R4 and R5. R4 traces a nearly
elliptical patchy ring of ~ 70 mas size (50 AU) with expanding motions of ~ 5
mas/yr (15 km/s). This structure is probably driven by the wind of a still
unidentified YSO located at the centre of the ring (~ 0.18"" south of HW2). On
the other hand, the R5 expanding bubble structure (driven by the wind of a
previously identified YSO located ~ 0.6"" south of HW2) is currently dissipating
in the circumstellar medium and losing its previous degree of symmetry,
indicating a very short-lived event. In addition, our results reveal, at scales
of ~ 1"" (700 AU), the simultaneous presence of a relatively slow (~ 10-70 km/s)
wide-angle outflow (opening angle of ~ 102 deg, traced by the masers, and the
fast (~ 500~km/s) highly collimated radio jet associated with HW2 (opening

radiation emission pattern, the geometry of the magnetic field, and the neutron

constrain the neutron star compactness and the magnetic field geometry. We
collect the data for 124 X-ray pulsars, which are mainly in high-mass X-ray
binary systems, and classify their pulse profiles according to the number of
observed peaks seen during one spin period, dividing them into two classes,
single- and double-peaked. We find that the pulsars are distributed about
equally between both groups. We also compute the probabilities predicted by the
theoretical models of two antipodal point-like spots that emit radiation
according to the pencil-like emission patterns. These are then compared to the
observed fraction of pulsars in the two classes. Assuming a blackbody emission
pattern, it is possible to constrain the neutron star compactness if the
magnetic dipole has arbitrary inclinations to the pulsar rotational axis. More
realistic pencil-beam patterns predict that 79% of the pulsars are
double-peaked independently of their compactness. The theoretical predictions
can be made consistent with the data if the magnetic dipole inclination to the
rotational axis has an upper limit of 40+/-4 deg. We also discuss the effect of
limited sensitivity of the X-ray instruments to detect weak pulses, which
lowers the number of detected double-peaked profiles and makes the theoretical
predictions to be consistent with the data even if the magnetic dipole does
have random inclinations. This shows that the statistics of pulse profiles does
not allow us to constrain the neutron star compactness. In contrast to the
previous claims by Bulik et al. (2003), the data also do not require the
magnetic inclination to be confined in a narrow interval.

paper is to determine for the first time and with precision its
precession-nutation motion. We adopt an Hamiltonian formalism of the motion of
rotation of rigid celestial body set up by Kinoshita (1977) based on Andoyer
variables and canonical equations. First we calculate Phoebe's obliquity at
J2000,0 from available astronomical data as well as the gravitational
perturbation due to Saturn on Phoebe rotational motion. Then we carry out a
numerical integration and we compare our results for the precession rate and
the nutation coefficients with pure analytical model. Our results for Phoebe
obliquity (23{\deg}95) and Phoebe precession rate (5580"".65/cy) are very close
to the respective values for the Earth. Moreover the amplitudes of the
nutations (26"" peak to peak for the nutaton in longitude and 8"" for the
nutation in obliquity) are of the same order as the respective amplitudes for
the Earth. We give complete tables of nutation, obtained from a FFT analysis
starting from the numerical signals. We show that a pure analytical model of
the nutation is not accurate due to the fact that Phoebe orbital elements e, M

nutation of Phoebe have been calculated for the first time in this paper. We
should keep on the study in the future by studying the additional gravitational

height measured from the iron plane due to the multiorbital nature of the
system, which is reflected to the nodeless/nodal form of the superconducting
gap and $T_c$. Surprisingly, even for the cuprates, which is conventionally
modeled by a single orbital model, the multiorbital band structure is shown to
play a crucial role in the material dependence of superconductivity. In fact,
by adopting a two orbital model that considers the $d_{z^2}$ orbital on top of
the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital, we can resolve a long standing puzzle of why the
single layered Hg cuprate have much higher $T_c$ than the La cuprate.
Interestingly, here again the apical oxygen height measured from the CuO$_2$

between $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals, thereby strongly affecting the

emission generation in a fully self-consistent plasma kinetic model for the
first time in the solar physics context. The simulations mimic the plasma
emission mechanism and Larmor drift instability in a plasma thread that
connects the Sun to Earth with the spatial scales compressed appropriately. The
effects of spatial density gradients on the generation of electromagnetic
radiation are investigated. It is shown that 1.5D inhomogeneous plasma with a
uniform background magnetic field directed transverse to the density gradient
is aperiodically unstable to Larmor-drift instability. The latter results in a
novel effect of generation of electromagnetic emission at plasma frequency.
When density gradient is removed (i.e. when plasma becomes stable to
Larmor-drift instability) and a $low$ density, super-thermal, hot beam is
injected along the domain, in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic
field, plasma emission mechanism generates non-escaping Langmuir type
oscillations which in turn generate escaping electromagnetic radiation. It is
found that in the spatial location where the beam is injected, the standing
waves, oscillating at the plasma frequency, are excited. These can be used to
interpret the horizontal strips observed in some dynamical spectra. Quasilinear
theory predictions: (i) the electron free streaming and (ii) the beam long
relaxation time, in accord with the analytic expressions, are corroborated via
direct, fully-kinetic simulation. Finally, the interplay of Larmor-drift
instability and plasma emission mechanism is studied by considering $dense$
electron beam in the Larmor-drift unstable (inhomogeneous) plasma.

intermittent flows in a pipe experiment showing that turbulent puffs have a
well defined interaction distance, which sets the minimum spacing of puffs as
well as the maximum observable turbulent fraction. Two methodologies are
employed here. Starting from a laminar flow puffs can be created by locally
injecting a jet of fluid through the pipe wall. When the perturbation is
applied periodically at low frequencies, as expected, a regular sequence of
puffs is observed where the puff spacing is given by the ratio of the mean flow
speed to the perturbation frequency. On the other hand, at large frequencies
puffs are found to interact and annihilate each other. Varying the perturbation
frequency an interaction distance can be determined. In the second set of
experiments, the Reynolds number is reduced suddenly from fully developed
turbulence to the intermittent regime.The resulting flow reorganizes itself to
a sequence of constant size puffs which, unlike in Couette and Taylor Couette
flow are randomly spaced. The minimum distance between the turbulent patches is
identical to the puff interaction length. The puff interaction length is found
to be in excellent agreement with the wavelength of regular stripe and spiral
patterns in plane Couette and Taylor-Couette flow. We propose that the same

they can be used as sensor heads in different devices. Some methods have been
proposed to solve the problem of determining the resonance frequencies and
their dependence on the stress caused by forces applied on the membrane
surface. The problem of the vibrating rectangular membrane under a stress
caused by a uniform in-plane force is well known. However, the resonance
frequency behaviour when the force is out-of-plane instead of in-plane, is not
so well understood and documented. A gradiometer which uses a silicon square
membrane with a magnet fixed on it as a sensor head has been developed in a
previous work. This device reports a quadratic dependence of the frequency on
the out-of-plane magnetic force. In this work, simulations to obtain the
dependence of the frequency of the fundamental flexural mode on the stress have
been performed. It has been studied the influence of in-plane and out-of-plane
forces applied to the membrane. As expected, a square root dependence has been
found for in-plane forces. Nevertheless, the problem is more complex when
out-of plane forces are considered. Out-of-plane forces gives rise to an
initial quadratic dependence which turns into a square root dependence from a
certain stress value. The quadratic range increases and the rate of change of
the frequency decreases as the surface of the magnet fixed on the membrane
increases. The study has addressed these problems and both, experimental and
simulated results have been compared and a good agreement between experimental
and simulated results has been found

dwarfs have been discovered in the last decade. The Canada-France Brown Dwarf
Survey is a wide-field survey for cool brown dwarfs conducted with the MegaCam
camera on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope telescope. Aims. Our objectives
are to find ultracool brown dwarfs and to constrain the field brown-dwarf
luminosity function and the mass function from a large and homogeneous sample
of L and T dwarfs. Methods. We identify candidates in CFHT/MegaCam i' and z'
images and follow them up with pointed near infrared (NIR) imaging on several
telescopes. Halfway through our survey we found ~50 T dwarfs and ~170 L or
ultra cool M dwarfs drawn from a larger sample of 1400 candidates with typical
ultracool dwarfs i' - z' colours, found in 780 square degrees. Results. We have
currently completed the NIR follow-up on a large part of the survey for all
candidates from mid-L dwarfs down to the latest T dwarfs known with utracool
dwarfs' colours. This allows us to draw on a complete and well defined sample
of 102 ultracool dwarfs to investigate the luminosity function and space
density of field dwarfs. Conclusions. We found the density of late L5 to T0
dwarfs to be 2.0pm0.8 x 10-3 objects pc-3, the density of T0.5 to T5.5 dwarfs
to be 1.4pm0.3 x 10-3 objects pc-3, and the density of T6 to T8 dwarfs to be
5.3pm3.1 x 10-3 objects pc-3 . We found that these results agree better with a
flat substellar mass function. Three latest dwarfs at the boundary between T
and Y dwarfs give the high density 8.3p9.0m5.1 x 10-3 objects pc-3. Although
the uncertainties are very large this suggests that many brown dwarfs should be
found in this late spectral type range, as expected from the cooling of brown
dwarfs, whatever their mass, down to very low temperature.

depending on the cross interactions between the two species. This work aims to
study the dynamic behavior of such binary mixtures by means of extensive
molecular dynamics simulations, and in particular to investigate the effect of
the addition of non-clustering particles on the dynamic scenario of
one-component cluster crystals. Analogies and differences with the
one-component case are revealed and discussed by analyzing self- and collective

eclipsing binary 2MASS J05352184-0546085, obtained during eclipse of the
lower-mass (secondary) brown dwarf. The observations yield the spectrum of the
higher-mass (primary) brown dwarf alone, with negligible (~1.6%) contamination
by the secondary. We perform a simultaneous fine-analysis of the TiO-epsilon
band and the red lobe of the KI doublet, using state-of-the-art PHOENIX Dusty
and Cond synthetic spectra. Comparing the effective temperature and surface
gravity derived from these fits to the {\it empirically} determined surface
gravity of the primary (logg=3.5) then allows us to test the model spectra as
well as probe the prevailing photospheric conditions. We find that: (1) fits to
TiO-epsilon alone imply Teff=2500 \pm 50K; (2) at this Teff, fits to KI imply
logg=3.0, 0.5 dex lower than the true value; and (3) at the true logg, KI fits
yield Teff=2650 \pm 50K, ~150K higher than from TiO-epsilon alone. On the one
hand, these are the trends expected in the presence of cool spots covering a
large fraction of the primary's surface (as theorized previously to explain the
observed Teff reversal between the primary and secondary). Specifically, our
results can be reproduced by an unspotted stellar photosphere with Teff=2700K
and (empirical) logg=3.5, coupled with axisymmetric cool spots that are 15%
cooler (2300K), have an effective logg=3.0 (0.5 dex lower than photospheric),
and cover 70% of the surface. On the other hand, the trends in our analysis can
also be reproduced by model opacity errors: there are lacks in the synthetic
TiO-epsilon opacities, at least for higher-gravity field dwarfs. Stringently
discriminating between the two possibilities requires combining the present
results with an equivalent analysis of the secondary (predicted to be
relatively unspotted compared to the primary).

at redshift z ~ 0 resting in the so called warm-hot intergalactic medium
(WHIM). The filaments and sheets of the WHIM have high temperatures 10^5 - 10^7
K) and a high degree of ionization while having only low to intermediate
densities. The particular physical conditions of the WHIM structures, e.g.
density and temperature profiles, velocity fields, are expected to leave their
special imprint on spectroscopic observations. In order to get further insight
into these conditions, we perform hydrodynamical simulations of the WHIM.
Instead of analyzing large simulations of cosmological structure formation, we
simulate particular well-defined structures and study the impact of different
physical processes as well as of the scale dependencies. We start with the
comprehensive study of the one-dimensional collapse (pancake) and examine the
influence of radiative cooling, heating due to an UV background, and thermal
conduction. We investigate the effect of small scale perturbations given
according to the initial cosmological power spectrum. If the initial
perturbation length scale L exceeds ~ 2 Mpc the collapse leads to shock
confined structures. As a result of radiative cooling and of heating due to an
UV background a relatively cold and dense core forms in the one-dimensional
case. The properties of the core (extension, density, and temperature) are
correlated with L. For larger L the core sizes are more concentrated. Thermal
conduction enhances this trend and may even result in an evaporation of the
core. Our estimates predict that a core may start to evaporate for perturbation
lengths larger than L ~ 30 Mpc. The obtained detailed profiles for density and
temperature for prototype WHIM structures allow for the determination of
possible spectral signatures by the WHIM.

To appear in Games of No Chance 4",,,,"math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Sprouts is a two-player topological game, invented in 1967 in the University
of Cambridge by John Conway and Michael Paterson. The game starts with p spots,
and ends in at most 3p-1 moves. The first player who cannot play loses.
  The complexity of the p-spot game is very high, so that the best hand-checked
proof only shows who the winner is for the 7-spot game, and the best previous
computer analysis reached p=11.
  We have written a computer program, using mainly two new ideas. The nimber
(also known as Sprague-Grundy number) allows us to compute separately
independent subgames; and when the exploration of a part of the game tree seems
to be too difficult, we can manually force the program to search elsewhere.
Thanks to these improvements, we reached up to p=32. The outcome of the 33-spot
game is still unknown, but the biggest computed value is the 47-spot game ! All
the computed values support the Sprouts conjecture: the first player has a
winning strategy if and only if p is 3, 4 or 5 modulo 6.
  We have also used a check algorithm to reduce the number of positions needed
to prove which player is the winner. It is now possible to hand-check all the
games until p=11 in a reasonable amount of time.

perspective on how this new piece of exact information can be used to treat
situations that are problematic for standard Kohn-Sham DFT. One way to use the
strong-interaction limit, more relevant for solid-state physical devices, is to
define a new framework to do practical, non-conventional, DFT calculations in
which a strong-interacting reference system is used instead of the traditional
non-interacting one of Kohn and Sham. Another way to proceed, more related to
chemical applications, is to include the exact treatment of the
strong-interaction limit into approximate exchange-correlation energy density
functionals in order to describe difficult situations such as the breaking of
the chemical bond.

an arbitrary function of the generalized (non-symmetric) Ricci curvature tensor

supplements the standard Einstein gravity with dark energy (the cosmological

only to gravity and can generate dark matter and/or inflation. The new field
masses (real or imaginary) have a geometric origin and must appear in any
concrete model. The concrete choice of the geometric Lagrangian determines
further details of the theory, for example, the nature of the vector and scalar
fields that can describe massive particles, tachyons, or even `phantoms'. In
`natural' geometric theories, which are discussed here, dark energy must also
arise. We mainly focus on intricate relations between geometry and dynamics

  figures",,,,"q-bio.SC physics.bio-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Rotation of a single bacterial flagellar motor is powered by multiple stators
tethered to the cell wall. In a ""power-stroke"" model the observed independence
of the speed at low load on the number of stators is explained by a
torque-dependent stepping mechanism independent of the strength of the stator
tethering spring. On the other hand, in models that depend solely on the stator
spring to explain the observed behavior, exceedingly small stator spring
constants are required. To study the dynamics of the motor driven by external
forces (such as those exerted by an optical tweezer), back-stepping is
introduced when stators are driven far out of equilibrium. Our model with
back-stepping reproduces the observed absence of a barrier to backward
rotation, as well the behaviors in the high-speed negative-torque regime.
Recently measured temperature dependence of the motor speed near zero load
(Yuan & Berg 2010 Biophys J) is explained quantitatively by the thermally
activated stepping rates in our model. Finally, we suggest that the general
mechanical properties of all molecular motors (linear and rotary),
characterized by their force(torque)-speed curve, can be determined by their
power-stroke potentials and the dependence of the stepping rates on the
mechanical state of the motor (force or speed). The torque-speed curve for the
clockwise rotating flagellar motor has been observed for the first time
recently (Yuan et al. 2010 PNAS). Its quasi-linear behavior is quantitatively
reproduced by our model. In particular, we show that concave and convex shapes
of the torque-speed curve can be achieved by changing the interaction potential
from linear to quadratic form. We also show that reversing the stepping rate
dependence on force (torque) can lead to non-monotonicity in the speed-load
dependency.

or a Keplerian disk. The inferred size makes the BLR in M84 the largest yet to
be measured. The fact that the BLR in M84 is so large may explain why the AGN
is unable to sustain the ionization seen there. Thus, the BLR in M84 is not
simply that of a scaled down quasar.

41-object z~0.5 radio galaxy sample in order to investigate the evolution of
the Fundamental Plane of radio galaxies. We find that the low-luminosity,
FRI-type, radio galaxies in our sample are consistent with the local
Fundamental Plane of radio galaxies defined by Bettoni et al. when corrected
for simple passive evolution of their stellar populations. However, we find
that the higher luminosity, FRII-type radio galaxies are inconsistent with the
local Fundamental Plane if only passive evolution is considered, and find
evidence for a rotation in the Fundamental Plane at z~0.5 when compared with
the local relation. We show that neither passive evolution, nor a
mass-dependent evolution in the mass-to-light ratio, nor an evolution in the
size of the host galaxies can, by themselves, plausibly explain the observed
tilt. However, we suggest that some combination of all three effects, with size
evolution as the dominant factor, may be sufficient to explain the difference
between the planes. We also find evidence for a correlation between host galaxy
velocity dispersion and radio luminosity at the 97% significance level within
our sub-sample, although further observations are required in order to
determine whether this is different for the FRI and FRII radio sources.
Assuming that the M_BH - sigma relation still holds at z~0.5, this implies that
radio luminosity scales with black hole mass, in agreement with previous
studies.

show that for blueshifted profiles an additional lobe with the same polarity as
the spot is present in the blue side of the average Stokes V profile. The
amplitude of the additional lobe grows with increasing blueshift and with
increasing heliocentric angle. For small redshifts, the profiles show an
additional lobe with the opposite polarity as the spot on the red side of the

average Stokes V profile is reversed for strong redshifts. The transition
between the different types of Stokes V profiles is continuous and indicates
that not only the vertical, but also the horizontal EF is a magnetized stream

randomly varying connectivity and server switchover time between the queues. At
each time slot the server decides either to stay with the current queue or
switch to the other queue based on the current connectivity and the queue
length information. The introduction of switchover time is a new modeling
component of this problem, which makes the problem much more challenging. We
develop a novel approach to characterize the stability region of the system by
using state action frequencies, which are stationary solutions to a Markov
Decision Process (MDP) formulation of the corresponding saturated system. We
characterize the stability region explicitly in terms of the connectivity
parameters and develop a frame-based dynamic control (FBDC) policy that is
shown to be throughput-optimal. In fact, the FBDC policy provides a new
framework for developing throughput-optimal network control policies using
state action frequencies. Furthermore, we develop simple Myopic policies that
achieve more than 96% of the stability region. Finally, simulation results show
that the Myopic policies may achieve the full stability region and are more
delay efficient than the FBDC policy in most cases.

general optimization model, a random walker following scaling laws (whose
traveling distances in each step obey a power law distribution with exponent
{\alpha}) tries to diversify its visiting places under a given total traveling
distance with a home-return probability. The results show that different
optimal exponents in between 1 and 2 can emerge naturally. Therefore, the
scaling property of human and animal mobility can be understood in our
framework where the discrepancy of the scaling law exponents is due to the
home-return constraint under the maximization of the visiting places diversity.
