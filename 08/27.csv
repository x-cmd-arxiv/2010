transition temperature T_c in Fe-based high-temperature superconductors (HTS)
are highly controversial. The values of the Fe isotope effect (Fe-IE) exponent
\alpha_Fe for various families of Fe-based HTS were found to be as well
positive, as negative, or even be exceedingly larger than the BCS value
\alpha_BCS=0.5. Here we demonstrate that the Fe isotope substitution causes
small structural modifications which, in turn, affect T_c. Upon correcting the

for cool stars ($T_{\rm eff}<8000\rm \, K$) is indicated by the Swan bands of
$\rm C_2$ in the optical part of their spectra. With decreasing effective
temperature these molecular bands undergo a significant blueshift ($\sim
100-300 \AA$). The origin of this phenomenon has been disputed over the last
two decades and has remained unknown. We attempt to address this problem by
investigating the impact of dense helium on the spectroscopic properties of
molecular carbon under the physical conditions encountered inside helium-rich,
fluid-like atmospheres of cool DQ white dwarfs. We found that the electronic
transition energy $T_e$ increases monotonically with the helium density
($\Delta T_{\rm e}\rm\, (eV)\sim1.6 \, \it \rho \rm \, (g/cm^3)$). This causes
the Swan absorption to occur at shorter wavelengths compared with unperturbed
$\rm C_2$. On the other hand the pressure-induced increase in the vibrational
frequency is insufficient to account for the observed Swan bands shifts. This
is consistent with the observations and indicates that the observed Swan-like
molecular bands are most likely the pressure-shifted bands of $\rm C_2$.

the ICRS via Hipparcos. The proper-motion errors range between 0.4 and 0.9
mas/yr, and are dominated by the number of measurable cluster members in these
regions which are very crowded by the bulge/bar and the thick disk. This samle
contains five metal poor ([Fe/H < -1.0) and four metal rich clusters; seven
clusters are located within 4 kpc from the Galactic center, while the remaining
two, namely NGC 6356 and NGC 6284 are in the background of the bulge at 7.5 kpc
from the Galactic center. By combining proper motions with radial velocities
and distances from the literature we derive 3D velocities. In a number of

  The two metal rich clusters NGC 6388 and NGC 6441 have velocities
incompatibile with membership in the thick disk or the bar of the Milky Way.
They can be though of as members of a kinematically hot system in the inner

with their similar Galactic location and peculiar but similar

activity is -4.2 +/- 0.1 AU from the Sun, which corresponds to -400 +/- 40 d
before perihelion. The total active time is TACTIVE= 1484 +/- 43 d. b) 103P is
a young dwarf comet, young because it has a photometric age P-AGE(1,1) = 15 +/-
2 cy (comet years), and dwarf because its diameter is DEFFE = 1.14 +/- 0.16 km.
c) The nucleus is very active, and the amplitude of the SLC is ASEC= 10.8 +/-
0.1 mag in 1997. This comet is as active as 1P/Halley, but much smaller. d)
After remaining active up to aphelion, the comet spills-over its activity into
the next orbit. e) Two linear laws change slope at a break point located at RBP
= -1.20 +/- 0.1 AU before perihelion, and magnitude mBP = 9.4 +/- 0.1.
Sublimation is not controlled by water ice. The controlling substance may be CO
or CO2 ice. CO2 has been detected spectroscopically. f) The water budget of
this comet is calculated. The comet expends 1.88 10^10 kg of water per
apparition. A new water-budget age is defined and it is found that WB-AGE = 19
cy vs WB-AGE = 0.65 cy for 1P/Halley and 28 cy for 9P. g) The values of
Af{\rho} are calculated on two dates and we find dust production rates of 106
and 37 kg/s. h) The thickness of the layer lost per apparition is calculated,
and we find {\Delta}r = 39 m where r is the radius. Since the radius of this
comet is r = 570 m, it is found that at the present rate the comet may
disappear in only 17 revolutions (~109 y). i) All comets visited by spacecraft
are young objects. 103P follows the same trend. It is expected that the surface
morphology that will be found in future EPOXI images should be very similar to
that of previous comets.

the Highly Improved Staggered Quark (HISQ) action for both the charm and the

determine the scalar form factor $f_0(q^2)$ for $D \rightarrow K, l \nu$
semileptonic decays. The form factor is obtained from a scalar current matrix
element that does not require any operator matching. We develop a new approach
to carrying out chiral/continuum extrapolations of $f_0(q^2)$. The method uses
the kinematic ""$z$"" variable instead of $q^2$ or the kaon energy $E_K$ and is
applicable over the entire physical $q^2$ range. We find $f^{D \rightarrow
K}_0(0) \equiv f^{D \rightarrow K}_+(0) = 0.747(19)$ in the chiral plus
continuum limit and hereby improve the theory error on this quantity by a
factor of $\sim$4 compared to previous lattice determinations. Combining the
new theory result with recent experimental measurements of the product $f^{D

precise direct determination of the CKM matrix element $|V_{cs}| $ to date,

second is the lattice QCD theory error. We calculate the ratio $f^{D

transmission-computation-energy tradeoff in wireless and fixed networks is
introduced. The analysis of this tradeoff considers both the transmission
energy as well as the energy consumed at the receiver to process the received
signal. While previous work considers linear decoder complexity, which is only
achieved by uncoded transmission, this paper claims that the average processing
(or computation) energy per symbol depends exponentially on the information
rate of the source message. The introduced framework is parametrized in a way
that it reflects properties of fixed and wireless networks alike.
  The analysis of this paper shows that exponential complexity and therefore
stronger codes are preferable at low data rates while linear complexity and
therefore uncoded transmission becomes preferable at high data rates. The more
the computation energy is emphasized (such as in fixed networks), the less hops
are optimal and the lower is the benefit of multi-hopping. On the other hand,
the higher the information rate of the single-hop network, the higher the
benefits of multi-hopping. Both conclusions are underlined by analytical
results.

from 12 Hickson compact groups in comparison with several control samples,
including the LVL+SINGS galaxies, interacting galaxies, and galaxies from the
Coma Cluster. We find that the HCG galaxies are strongly bimodal, with
statistically significant evidence for a gap in their distribution. In
contrast, none of the other samples show such a marked gap, and only galaxies
in the Coma infall region have a distribution that is statistically consistent
with the HCGs in this parameter space. To further investigate the cause of the
HCG gap, we compare the galaxy morphologies of the HCG and LVL+SINGS galaxies,
and also probe the specific star formation rate (SSFR) of the HCG galaxies.
While galaxy morphology in HCG galaxies is strongly linked to position with MIR
colorspace, the more fundamental property appears to be the SSFR, or star
formation rate normalized by stellar mass. We conclude that the unusual MIR
color distribution of HCG galaxies is a direct product of their environment,
which is most similar to that of the Coma infall region. In both cases, galaxy
densities are high, but gas has not been fully processed or stripped. We
speculate that the compact group environment fosters accelerated evolution of
galaxies from star-forming and neutral gas-rich to quiescent and neutral
gas-poor, leaving few members in the MIR gap at any time.

absolute magnitudes. Overall, we find that HR 8799 b has a spectral type
consistent with L5-T2, although its SED is atypical compared to most field
objects. We fit the 2.2 um spectrum and the infrared SED using the Hubeny &
Burrows, Burrows et al., and Ames-Dusty model atmosphere grids, which
incorporate nonequilibrium chemistry, non-solar metallicities, and clear and
cloudy variants. No models agree with all of the data, but those with
intermediate clouds produce significantly better fits. The largest discrepancy
occurs in the J-band, which is highly suppressed in HR 8799 b. The best-fitting
effective temperatures range from 1300-1700 K with radii between ~0.3-0.5 RJup.
These values are inconsistent with evolutionary model-derived values of 800-900
K and 1.1-1.3 RJup based on the luminosity of HR 8799 b and the age of HR 8799,
a discrepancy that probably results from imperfect atmospheric models or the
limited range of physical parameters covered by the models. The low temperature
inferred from evolutionary models indicates that HR 8799 b is ~400 K cooler
than field L/T transition objects, providing further evidence that the L/T
transition is gravity-dependent. With an unusually dusty photosphere, an
exceptionally low luminosity for its spectral type, and hints of extreme
secondary physical parameters, HR 8799 b appears to be unlike any class of
field brown dwarf currently known.

providing an improved description of galaxy clustering. Recent surveys, like
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Anglo-Australian Two-degree survey
(2dF), have shown that there seems to be a correlation between the clustering
of galaxies and their properties such as metallicity and star formation rate,
which are believed to be environment-dependent. This environmental dependence
is not included in the standard halo model where the host halo mass is the only
variable specifying galaxy properties. In our approach, the halo properties
i.e., the concentration, and the Halo Occupation Distribution --HOD--
prescription, will not only depend on the halo mass (like in the standard halo
model) but also on the halo environment. We examine how different environmental
dependence of halo concentration and HOD prescription affect the correlation
function. We see that at the level of dark matter, the concentration of haloes
affects moderately the dark matter correlation function only at small scales.
However the galaxy correlation function is extremely sensitive to the HOD
details, even when only the HOD of a small fraction of haloes is modified.

function (IMF). To test this claim, we have, for the first time, combined
high-resolution 3-D hydrodynamic simulations of isolated and merging massive,
gas-rich galaxies, radiative transfer, and a semi-empirical merger rate model
to predict the number density of SMGs. Our model can reproduce the observed SMG
number density even when using a standard (Kroupa) IMF. The agreement is due to
a combination of relatively long sub-mm duty cycles for mergers (a few times
10^8 years for our most massive models), which owe to our combination of
high-resolution 3-D hydrodynamic simulations and dust radiative transfer;
sufficient number densities of massive, gas-rich mergers; and the decrease in
sub-mm counts observed by recent deep/wide surveys (e.g., Austermann et al.
2010) relative to previous surveys. Our results suggest that the observed SMG
number counts do not provide evidence for a top-heavy IMF at high redshift.

Segue 1 is a dark-matter-dominated galaxy at high probability with an intrinsic

to produce this dispersion must have an average density of 2.5^{+4.1}_{-1.9}

consistent with the 180 year mean period seen in the solar vicinity at about 1

emission from a highly rotating black hole is strongly spin dependent, with
particles of highest spin (gravitons) dominating the energy spectrum. So far,
there has been no analytic explanation or description of this effect. Using
""gravitomagnetism"", or the formal analogy between the Maxwell's field equations
for electro- magnetism and Einstein's equations for gravity, we were able to
establish a link between the spin of the rotating black hole and spin of an
emitted particle. Namely, the intrinsic spin of the particle creates a ""mass
dipole moment"" which interacts with external gravitomagnetic field whose source
is the rotation of the black hole. We showed that a rotating black hole prefers
to shed its spin, i.e. tends to emit particles with the spin parallel to its
own. We also showed that the probability for emission grows with the increasing
spin of the emitted particles. The amplification factors can be huge if a black
hole is highly rotating, i.e. close to extremal. When applied to central
galactic black holes, the same physical mechanism indicate that particles
orbiting around these black holes should have spins strongly correlated with
the spin of the black hole, which may have implications for cosmic rays
believed to be coming from these regions of space.

companions of the radio galaxies. The overdensities have estimated masses in
excess of 10^14 solar masses, and are dense enough to collapse into virizalised
structures by the present day: these structures may evolve into groups or
clusters of galaxies. A flux-limited sample of protocluster galaxies with K <

assessment of the presence and masses of supermassive black holes in quiescent
galaxies. It would also provide invaluable information on bulge scale stellar
processes (such as two-body relaxation) via the rate at which stars are
injected into the tidal sphere of influence of the black holes. This rate, in
turn, is essential to predict gravitational radiation emission by compact
object inspirals. The signature of a tidal disruption event is thought to be a
fallback rate for the stellar debris onto the black hole that decreases as
$t^{-5/3}$. This mass flux is often assumed to yield a luminous signal that
decreases in time at the same rate. In this paper, we calculate the
monochromatic lightcurves arising from such an accretion event. Differently
from previous studies, we adopt a more realistic description of the fallback
rate and of the super-Eddigton accretion physics. We also provide simultaneous
lightcurves in optical, UV and X-rays. We show that, after a few months,
optical and UV lightcurves scale as $t^{-5/12}$, and are thus substantially
flatter than the $t^{-5/3}$ behaviour, which is a prerogative of the bolometric
lightcurve, only. At earlier times and for black hole masses $< 10^7 M_{\sun}$,
the wind emission dominates: after reaching a peak of $10^{41}-10^{43}$ erg/s
at roughly a month, the lightcurve decreases steeply as $\sim t^{-2.6}$, until
the disc contribution takes over. The X-ray band, instead, is the best place to
detect the $t^{-5/3}$ ""smoking gun"" behaviour, although it is displayed only
for roughly a year, before the emission steepens exponentially.

relativistically expanding plasma outflow, characterized by a constant Lorentz
factor, Gamma. Photons that are injected in regions of high optical depth are
advected with the flow until they escape at the photosphere. Due to multiple
scattering below the photosphere, the locally emerging comoving photon
distribution is thermal. However, as an observer sees simultaneously photons
emitted from different angles, hence with different Doppler boosting, the
observed spectrum is a multi-color black-body. We calculate here the properties
of the observed spectrum at different observed times. Due to the strong
dependence of the photospheric radius on the angle to the line of sight, for
parameters characterizing gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) thermal photons are seen up
to tens of seconds following the termination of the inner engine. At late
times, following the inner engine termination, both the number flux and energy
flux of the thermal spectrum decay as F ~ t^{-2}. At these times, the
multicolor black body emission results in a power law at low energies (below
the thermal peak), with power law index F_\nu ~ \nu^{0}. This result is
remarkably similar to the average value of the low energy spectral slope index
(``\alpha'') seen in fitting the spectra of large GRB sample.

superimposed flares or accretion instabilities grow in size from about 0.0003

on a time scale of a few years. The resulting variability has properties of
stochastic ""red"" noise, whose self-similar characteristics are very similar to
those observed in cataclysmic binary stars, but with much longer characteristic
time scales of hours to days (rather than minutes) and with amplitudes which
appear to cease growing in size on time scales of tens of years. In addition to
chaotic brightness variations combined with stochastic noise, the MOST data

25 local active galaxies selected from the SDSS (0.02<z<0.1; MBH>10^7 M_sun) to
study the relations between black hole mass (MBH) and host-galaxy properties.
We determine stellar kinematics of the host galaxy, deriving stellar-velocity
dispersion profiles and rotation curves from three spectral regions (including
CaH&K, MgIb triplet, and CaII triplet). In addition, we perform surface
photometry on SDSS images, using a newly developed code for joint multi-band
analysis. BH masses are estimated from the width of the Hbeta emission line and
the host-galaxy free 5100A AGN luminosity. Combining results from spectroscopy
and imaging allows us to study four MBH scaling relations: MBH-sigma,
MBH-L(sph), MBH-M(sph,*), MBH-M(sph,dyn). We find the following results. First,
stellar-velocity dispersions determined from aperture spectra (e.g. SDSS fiber
spectra or unresolved data from distant galaxies) can be biased, depending on
aperture size, AGN contamination, and host-galaxy morphology. However, such a
bias cannot explain the offset seen in the MBH-sigma relation at higher
redshifts. Second, while the CaT region is the cleanest to determine
stellar-velocity dispersions, both the MgIb region, corrected for FeII
emission, and the CaHK region, although often swamped by the AGN powerlaw
continuum and emission lines, can give results accurate to within a few
percent. Third, the MBH scaling relations of our pilot sample agree in slope
and scatter with those of other local active and inactive galaxies. In the next
papers of the series we will quantify the scaling relations, exploiting the
full sample of ~100 objects.

quasar populations can strongly constrain the lifetimes and emission geometry
of quasars. By comparing the HeII and HI Lyman-alpha forests along a particular
line of sight, one can trace fluctuations in the hardness of the radiation
field (which are driven by fluctuations in the HeII ionization rate). Because
this high-energy background is highly variable - thanks to the rarity of the
bright quasars that dominate it and the relatively short attenuation lengths of
these photons - it is straightforward to associate features in the radiation
field with their source quasars. Here we quantify how finite lifetimes and
beamed emission geometries affect these expectations. Finite lifetimes induce a
time delay that displaces the observed radiation peak relative to the quasar.
For beamed emission, geometry dictates that sources invisible to the observer
can still create a peak in the radiation field. We show that both these models
produce substantial populations of ""bare"" peaks (without an associated quasar)
for reasonable parameter values (lifetimes ~10^6-10^8 yr and beaming angles <90
degrees). A comparison to existing quasar surveys along two HeII Lyman-alpha
forest lines of sight rules out isotropic emission and infinite lifetime at
high confidence; they can be accommodated either by moderate beaming or
lifetimes ~10^7-10^8 yr. We also show that the distribution of radial
displacements between peaks and their quasars can unambiguously distinguish
these two models, although larger statistical samples are needed.

that the galaxy clusters have triaxial shapes and that the cluster galaxies
have a strong tendency to be located preferentially along the major axes of
host cluster's dark matter distributions due to the gravitational tidal effect.
The predicted correlations between dark matter and galaxy distributions in
triaxial clusters are insensitive to the initial cosmological parameters and to
the galaxy bias, and thus can provide a unique test-bed for the nonlinear
structure formation of the LCDM cosmology. Recently, Oguri et al. determined
robustly the dark matter distributions in the galaxy clusters using the two
dimensional weak lensing shear fitting and showed that the orientations of the
cluster galaxy distributions are only very weakly correlated with those of the
underlying dark matter distributions determined robustly, which is in contrast
to with the LCDM-based prediction. We reanalyze and compare quantitatively the
observational result with the LCDM-based prediction from the Millennium Run
simulation with the help of the bootstrap resampling and generalized
chi^{2}-statistics. The hypothesis that the observational result is consistent
with the LCDM-based prediction is ruled out at the 99% confidence level. A
local fifth force induced by a non-minimal coupling between dark energy and

stable circular orbit (ISCO) due to the conservative self-force that arises
from the finite-mass of an orbiting test-particle. This is one of the first
concrete results of the self-force program, and provides an exact point of
comparison with approximate post-Newtonian (PN) computations of the ISCO. Here
this exact ISCO shift is compared with nearly all known PN-based methods. These
include both ""nonresummed"" and ""resummed"" approaches (the latter reproduce the
test-particle limit by construction). The best agreement with the exact result
is found from effective-one-body (EOB) calculations that are fit to numerical
relativity simulations. However, if one considers uncalibrated methods based
only on the currently known 3PN-order conservative dynamics, the best agreement
is found from the gauge-invariant ISCO condition of Blanchet and Iyer (2003).
This method reproduces the exact test-particle limit without any resummation. A
comparison of PN methods with the equal-mass ISCO is also performed. The
results of this study suggest that the EOB approach---while exactly
incorporating the conservative test-particle dynamics---does not (in the
absence of calibration) incorporate conservative self-force effects more
accurately than standard PN methods. I also consider how the conservative
self-force ISCO shift, combined with numerical relativity computations of the
ISCO, can be used to constrain our knowledge of (1) the EOB effective metric,
(2) phenomenological inspiral-merger-ringdown templates, and (3) 4PN and 5PN
order terms in the PN orbital energy. These constraints could help in
constructing better gravitational-wave templates. Lastly, I suggest a new
method to calibrate unknown PN-terms in inspiral templates using
numerical-relativity calculations.

that can arise are analyzed: if the gauge parameters propagate in the bulk, the
excited Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes are gauge fields, but they are matter vector
fields if these parameters are confined in the 3-brane. In the former case, it
is shown that the 4DET is gauge invariant only if the compactification is
carried out by using curvatures instead of gauge fields as fundamental objects.
It is shown that the 4DET is governed by two types of gauge transformations,
one determined by the KK zero modes of the gauge parameters and the other by
the excited KK modes. The Dirac's method and the proper solution of the master
equation are employed to show that the theory is subject to first class
constraints. A gauge-fixing procedure to quantize the KK modes, that is
covariant under the first type of gauge transformations, is introduced. The
ghost sector induced by these gauge-fixing functions is derived on the basis of
the BRST formalism. The effective quantum Lagrangian that links the
interactions between light physics and heavy physics is presented. Concerning
the radiative corrections of the excited KK modes on the light Green functions,
the predictive character of this Lagrangian is stressed. In the case of the
gauge parameters confined to the 3-brane, the known result in the literature is
reproduced with some minor variants, although it is emphasized that the excited
KK modes are not gauge fields, but matter fields that transform under the

give the atmospheric delay and clock offsets to use in analysis of the GPS

parameters of the satellites {\bf in the ICRF reference frame}, i.e. relative

focus on the onset of chaos. To this end, we investigate the case of a rotating
black hole immersed in a weak, asymptotically uniform magnetic field. We also
consider a magnetic star, approximated by the Schwarzschild metric and a test
magnetic field of a rotating dipole. These are two model examples of systems
permitting energetically bound, off-equatorial motion of matter confined to the
halo lobes that encircle the central body. Our approach allows us to address
the question of whether the spin parameter of the black hole plays any major
role in determining the degree of the chaoticness. To characterize the motion,
we construct the Recurrence Plots (RP) and we compare them with Poincar\'e
surfaces of section. We describe the Recurrence Plots in terms of the
Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA), which allows us to identify the
transition between different dynamical regimes. We demonstrate that this new
technique is able to detect the chaos onset very efficiently, and to provide
its quantitative measure. The chaos typically occurs when the conserved energy
is raised to a sufficiently high level that allows the particles to traverse
the equatorial plane. We find that the role of the black-hole spin in setting
the chaos is more complicated than initially thought.

However, in this paper we re-examine Freund's problem in case the experts have
internal structure that enables them to learn. In this case the problem has two

the subsequence on which they are being tracked? The MPP algorithm solves the
first case. Our contribution is to generalise MPP to address the second option.
The results we obtain apply to any expert structure that can be formalised

variational Monte Carlo (VMC) and lattice regularized diffusion Monte Carlo

a Slater determinant and a Jastrow factor. Once the Jastrow factor is optimized

  magnetic field","8 pages, 2 figures",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Rutherford planetary model of a proton-electron atom is modified. Besides
the Coulomb interaction of the point electron with the proton, its strong
Coulomb interaction with the physical vacuum as well as the magnetic
interaction between moving charges are taken into account. The vacuum
interaction leads to the motion of the electron with the velocity of light
\textit{c} in the circle with the radius being equal to the so-called classical
electron radius $r_e$. Therefore, the velocity of the electron consists of two
components: the velocity $\vec{\upsilon}$ of the mechanical motion and the
velocity $\vec{c}$ of the photon-like motion. We postulate that
$\vec{\upsilon}\bot \vec{c}$, and $\upsilon < c $. Hence, the electron inside
the atom moves with the resulting faster-than-light velocity. The existence of
two types of proton-electron atoms, the hydrogen atom and the neutron, is
interpreted by the different motion and interaction of particles at large ($ r
>> r_e $) and short ($ r < r_e $) distances. In the first atom, the effect of
photon-like motion is small, and the electron moves around the proton with the
velocity $\upsilon << c$ in an orbit of the radius $ r>>r_{e}$. In the second
atom, the photon-like motion is the determining factor, and the electron moves
around the proton with the faster-than-light velocity in an orbit of the radius
$r < r_{e}$. The calculated ground-state properties of the free hydrogen atom
and the free neutron are in good agreement with the experimental data. The
properties of these atoms in extremely strong magnetic fields ($B >> 10^8 T$)

the pressures measured in these high redshift CI clouds are similar to those

conserving systems, a low frequency peak is seen that, is higher than the zero
frequency response for large systems. For momentum non-conserving systems,
there is no low frequency peak. The momentum non-conserving system is expected
to satisfy Fourier's law, however, at the single bond level, we do not see any
clear agreement with the predictions of the diffusion equation even at low
frequencies. We also derive an exact analytical expression for the response of
a chain of harmonic oscillators to a (not necessarily small) temperature
difference; the agreement with the linear response simulation results for the
same system is excellent.

an important class of complex fluid. Of particular significance for many

microscopic interactions between the constituents. An important step towards
attaining this goal is the development of robust theoretical methods for
predicting from first-principles the rheology and nonequilibrium microstructure
of well defined model systems subject to external flow. In this review we give
an overview of some promising theoretical approaches and the phenomena they
seek to describe, focusing, for simplicity, on systems for which the colloidal
particles interact via strongly repulsive, spherically symmetric interactions.
In presenting the various theories, we will consider first low volume fraction
systems, for which a number of exact results may be derived, before moving on
to consider the intermediate and high volume fraction states which present both
the most interesting physics and the most demanding technical challenges. In
the high volume fraction regime particular emphasis will be given to the
rheology of dynamically arrested states.

properties and feasibility using a theoretical model. A large set of
single-frequency continuous-wave lasers oscillate by amplification in spatially
separated gain media. They are mutually phase-locked by nonlinear feedback from
a common saturable absorber. As a result, ultra short pulses are generated. The
new scheme offers three significant benefits: the light that is amplified in
each medium is continuous wave, thereby avoiding issues related to group
velocity dispersion and nonlinear effects that can perturb the pulse shape. The
set of frequencies on which the laser oscillates, and therefore the pulse
repetition rate, is controlled by the geometry of resonator-internal optical
elements, not by the cavity length. Finally, the bandwidth of the laser can be
controlled by switching gain modules on and off. This scheme offers a route to
mode-locked lasers with high average output power, repetition rates that can be
scaled into the THz range, and a bandwidth that can be dynamically controlled.
The approach is particularly suited for implementation using semiconductor
diode laser arrays.

that for real metals the two formulations of the PFA used in the literature
lead to relative differences in the obtained results being less than a small

with available exact results. It is emphasized that in the experimental region
in the zeroth order of the small parameter mentioned above the thermal Casimir

the exact results are shown to converge to the PFA results when the small

that large thermal effects predicted by the Drude model approach, if existing

galaxy clusters. Propagation in form of CR diffusion and streaming tends to
drive the CR radial profiles towards being flat, with equal CR number density
everywhere. Advection of CR by the turbulent gas motions tends to produce
centrally enhanced profiles. We assume that the CR streaming velocity is of the
order of the sound velocity. This is motivated by plasma physical arguments.
The CR streaming is then usually larger than typical advection velocities and
becomes comparable or lower than this only for periods with trans- and
super-sonic cluster turbulence. As a consequence a bimodality of the CR spatial
distribution results. Strongly turbulent, merging clusters should have a more
centrally concentrated CR energy density profile with respect to relaxed ones
with very subsonic turbulence. This translates into a bimodality of the
expected diffuse radio and gamma-ray emission of clusters, since more centrally
concentrated CR will find higher target densities for hadronic CR proton
interactions, higher plasma wave energy densities for CR electron and proton
re-acceleration, and stronger magnetic fields. Thus, the observed bimodality of
cluster radio halos appears to be a natural consequence of the interplay of CR
transport processes, independent of the model of radio halo formation, be it
hadronic interactions of CR protons or re-acceleration of low-energy CR
electrons. Energy dependence of the CR propagation should lead to spectral
steepening of dying radio halos. Furthermore, we show that the interplay of CR
diffusion with advection implies first order CR re-acceleration in the
pressure-stratified atmospheres of galaxy clusters. Finally, we argue that CR
streaming could be important in turbulent cool cores of galaxy clusters since
it heats preferentially the central gas with highest cooling rate.

on board Hinode have shown that low density areas on the periphery of active
regions are characterized by strong blue-shifts at 1 MK. These Doppler shifts
have been associated with outward propagating disturbances observed with
Extreme-ultraviolet and soft X-ray imagers. Since these instruments can have
broad temperature responses we investigate these intensity fluctuations using
the monochromatic imaging capabilities of EIS and confirm their 1 MK nature. We
also find that the Fe XII 195.119 A blue shifted spectral profiles at their
footpoints exhibit transient blue wing enhancements on timescales as short as
the 5 minute cadence. We have also looked at the fan peripheral loops observed
at 0.6 MK in Si VII 275.368 A in those regions and find no sign of the
recurrent outward propagating disturbances with velocities of 40 - 130 km/s
seen in Fe XII. We do observe downward trends (15 - 20 km/s) consistent with
the characteristic red-shifts measured at their footpoints. We, therefore, find
no evidence that the structures at these two temperatures and the intensity
fluctuations they exhibit are related to one another.

only at the encoder, it is well-known that Gelfand-Pinsker coding achieves its
capacity. In this paper, we analyze Gelfand-Pinsker coding scheme and capacity
to bring out further understandings. We show that Gelfand-Pinsker capacity is
equal to the interference-free capacity. Thus the capacity of a channel with
non-causal state information available only at the encoder is the same as if
the state information is also available at the decoder. Furthermore, the
capacity-achieving conditional input distributions in these two cases are the
same. This lets us connect the studied channel with state to the multiple
access channel (MAC) with correlated sources and show that under certain
conditions, the receiver can decode both the message and the state information.
This dual decoding can be obtained in particular if the state sequences come
from a known codebook with rate satisfying a simple constraint. In such a case,
we can modify Gelfand-Pinsker coding by pre-building multiple codebooks of
input sequences $X^n$, each codebook is for a given state sequence $S^n$, upon
generating the auxiliary $U^n$ sequences. The modified Gelfand-Pinsker coding
scheme achieves the capacity of the MAC with degraded message set and still
allows for decoding of just the message at any state information rate. We then
revisit dirty-paper coding for the Gaussian channel to verify our analysis and
modified coding scheme.

Markov chain (CTMC). This paper presents a mapping semantics from PEPA to ODEs
based on a numerical representation scheme, which extends the class of PEPA
models that can be subjected to fluid approximation. Furthermore, we have
established the fundamental characteristics of the derived ODEs, such as the
existence, uniqueness, boundedness and nonnegativeness of the solution. The
convergence of the solution as time tends to infinity for several classes of
PEPA models, has been proved under some mild conditions. For general PEPA
models, the convergence is proved under a particular condition, which has been
revealed to relate to some famous constants of Markov chains such as the
spectral gap and the Log-Sobolev constant. This thesis has established the
consistency between the fluid approximation and the underlying CTMCs for PEPA,
i.e. the limit of the solution is consistent with the equilibrium probability
distribution corresponding to a family of underlying density dependent CTMCs.

and to display swarm behavior. We investigate two model systems, self-propelled
rods interacting via volume exclusion, and sinusoidally-beating flagella
embedded in a fluid with hydrodynamic interactions. In the flagella system,
beating frequencies are Gaussian distributed with a non-zero average. These
systems are studied by Brownian-dynamics simulations and by mesoscale
hydrodynamics simulations, respectively. The clustering behavior is analyzed as
the particle density and the environmental or internal noise are varied. By
distinguishing three types of cluster-size probability density functions, we
obtain a phase diagram of different swarm behaviors. The properties of
clusters, such as their configuration, lifetime and average size are analyzed.
We find that the swarm behavior of the two systems, characterized by several
effective power laws, is very similar. However, a more careful analysis reveals
several differences. Clusters of self-propelled rods form due to partially
blocked forward motion, and are therefore typically wedge-shaped. At higher rod
density and low noise, a giant mobile cluster appears, in which most rods are
mostly oriented towards the center. In contrast, flagella become
hydrodynamically synchronized and attract each other; their clusters are
therefore more elongated. Furthermore, the lifetime of flagella clusters decays
more quickly with cluster size than of rod clusters.
