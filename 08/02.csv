Mpc regions of dynamically disturbed galaxy clusters (radio halos). The
morphological and spectral properties of these sources suggest that the
emitting electrons are accelerated by spatially distributed and gentle
mechanisms, providing some indirect evidence for turbulent acceleration in the
inter-galactic-medium (IGM). Only deep upper limits to the energy associated
with relativistic protons in the IGM have been recently obtained through gamma
and radio observations. Yet these protons should be (theoretically) the main
non-thermal particle component in the IGM implying the unavoidable production,
at some level, of secondary particles that may have a deep impact on the gamma
ray and radio properties of galaxy clysters. Following Brunetti and Lazarian
(2007), in this paper we consider the advances in the theory of MHD turbulence
to develop a comprehensive picture of turbulence in the IGM and extend our
previous calculations of particle acceleration by compressible MHD turbulence
by considering self-consistently the reacceleration of both primary and
secondary particles. Under these conditions we expect that radio to gamma ray
emission is generated from galaxy clusters with a complex spectrum that depends
on the dynamics of the thermal gas and Dark Matter. The non-thermal emission
results in very good agreement with radio observations and with present
constraints from hard X-ray and gamma ray observations. In our model giant
radio halos are generated in merging (turbulent) clusters only. However, in
case secondaries dominate the electron component in the IGM, we expect that the
level of the Mpc-scale synchrotron emission in more relaxed clusters is already
close to that of the radio upper limits derived by present observations of
clusters without radio halos.

ERs, larger are the amplitudes of sunspot cycle). For a long-term prediction
(dT about 1.5 solar cycles), latitude of ERs at declining phase of n-th cycle
determines the amplitude of (n+2)-th sunspot cycle (lower is the latitude of

production of entropy in simulated galaxy clusters. The occurrence of the flat
entropy core is found to be mainly due to hydro-dynamical processes resolved in
the code and that additional spurious effects of numerical origin (e.g.
artificial heating due to softening effects or N-body noise) can affect the
size and level of the entropy core only in a minor way. We show that the
entropy profile of non-radiative simulations is produced by a mechanism of
""sorting in entropy"" which takes place with regularity during the cluster
evolution. Using gas tracers we prove that the flat entropy core is caused by
physical mixing of gravity-driven subsonic motions within the shallow inner
cluster potential. Re-simulations were also produced for the same cluster
object with the addition of radiative cooling, uniform pre-heating at high
redshift (z=10) and late (z<1) thermal energy feedback from AGN activity in the
cluster, in order to assess the effects of such mechanisms on the final entropy
profile of the cluster. We report on the infeasibility of balancing the
catastrophic cooling and recovering a flat entropy profile with the
investigated trials for AGN activity alone, while for a sub-set of pre-heating

the third fundamental class of nonlinear modes -- $q$-breathers -- periodic

space. To date, the studies of $q$-breathers have been confined to the cubic
and quartic nonlinearity in the interaction potential. In this paper we study
the case of arbitrary nonlinearity index $\gamma$ in an acoustic chain. We
uncover qualitative difference in the scaling of delocalization and stability
thresholds of $q$-breathers with the system size: there exists a critical index
$\gamma^*=6$, below which both thresholds (in nonlinearity strength) tend to
zero, and diverge when above. We also demonstrate that this critical index
value is decisive for the presence or absense of thermalization. For a generic
interaction potential the mode space localized dynamics is determined only by
the three lowest order nonlinear terms in the power series expansion.

provide excellent sites for nanochemistry. Vermiculite is one such smectite
clay and in the presence of small chain-length alkyl-NH3Cl ions, forms
sensitive, 1-D ordered model clay systems with expandable nano-pore inter-layer
regions. These inter-layers readily adsorb organic molecules. N-propyl NH3Cl
vermiculite clay gels were used to determine the adsorption of alanine, lysine
and histidine by chiral HPLC. The results show that during reaction with fresh
vermiculite interlayers, significant chiral enrichment of either L- and
D-enantiomers occurs depending on the amino acid. Chiral enrichment of the
supernatant solutions is up to about 1% per pass. In contrast, addition to clay
interlayers already reacted with amino acid solutions resulted in little or no
change in D/L ratio during the time of the experiment. Adsorption of small
amounts of amphiphilic organic molecules in clay inter-layers is known to
produce Layer-by-Layer or Langmuir-Blodgett films. Moreover atomistic
simulations show that self-organization of organic species in clay interlayers
is important. These non-centrosymmetric, chirally active nanofilms may cause
clays to act subsequently as chiral amplifiers, concentrating organic material
from dilute solution and having different adsorption energetics for D- and
L-enantiomers. The additional role of clays in RNA oligimerization already
postulated by Ferris and others, together with the need for the organization of
amphiphilic molecules and lipids noted by Szostak and others, suggests that
such chiral separation by clays in lagoonal environments at normal biological

its further development mostly in the works of G. Boillat, I-Shis Liu and
T.Ruggeri. ""Entropy Principle"" combines in itself the structural requirement on
the form of balance laws of the thermodynamical system (denote such system
$(\mathcal{C})$) and on the entropy balance law with the convexity condition of
the entropy density. First of these requirements has pure mathematical form
defining so called ""supplementary balance laws"" (shortly SBL) associated with
the original balance system. Vector space of SBL can be considered as a kind of
natural ""closure"" of the original balance system. This space includes the
original balance laws, the entropy balance, the balance laws corresponding to
the symmetries of the balance system and some other balance equations. We
consider the case of Rational Extended Thermodynamics where densities, fluxes
and sources of the balance equations do not depend on the derivatives of
physical fields $y^i$. We present the basic structures of RET: Lagrange-Liu

to form the most lucrative partnership with another agent from among several
alternatives. There has been a flurry of recent research studying Nash
bargaining solutions (also called 'balanced outcomes') in bargaining networks,
so that we now know when such solutions exist, and also that they can be
computed efficiently, even by market agents behaving in a natural manner. In
this work we study a generalization of Nash bargaining, that models the
possibility of unequal 'bargaining powers'. This generalization was introduced
in [KB+10], where it was shown that the corresponding 'unequal division' (UD)
solutions exist if and only if Nash bargaining solutions exist, and also that a
certain local dynamics converges to UD solutions when they exist. However, the
bound on convergence time obtained for that dynamics was exponential in network
size for the unequal division case. This bound is tight, in the sense that
there exists instances on which the dynamics of [KB+10] converges only after
exponential time. Other approaches, such as the one of Kleinberg and Tardos, do
not generalize to the unsymmetrical case. Thus, the question of computational
tractability of UD solutions has remained open. In this paper, we provide an
FPTAS for the computation of UD solutions, when such solutions exist. On a
graph G=(V,E) with weights (i.e. pairwise profit opportunities) uniformly
bounded above by 1, our FPTAS finds an \eps-UD solution in time
poly(|V|,1/\eps). We also provide a fast local algorithm for finding \eps-UD
solution, providing further justification that a market can find such a
solution.

random assignment achieves the best possible approximation ratio. For instance,
a simple random assignment for {\sc Max-E3-Sat} allows 7/8-approximation and
for every $\eps >0$ there is no polynomial-time ($7/8+\eps$)-approximation
unless P=NP. Another example is the {\sc Permutation CSP} of bounded arity.
Given the expected fraction $\rho$ of the constraints satisfied by a random
assignment (i.e. permutation), there is no $(\rho+\eps)$-approximation
algorithm for every $\eps >0$, assuming the Unique Games Conjecture (UGC).
  In this work, we consider the following parameterization of constraint
satisfaction problems. Given a set of $m$ constraints of constant arity, can we
satisfy at least $\rho m +k$ constraint, where $\rho$ is the expected fraction
of constraints satisfied by a random assignment? {\sc Constraint Satisfaction
Problems above Average} have been posed in different forms in the literature
\cite{Niedermeier2006,MahajanRamanSikdar09}. We present a faster parameterized
algorithm for deciding whether $m/2+k/2$ equations can be simultaneously
satisfied over ${\mathbb F}_2$. As a consequence, we obtain $O(k)$-variable
bikernels for {\sc boolean CSPs} of arity $c$ for every fixed $c$, and for {\sc
permutation CSPs} of arity 3. This implies linear bikernels for many problems
under the ""above average"" parameterization, such as {\sc Max-$c$-Sat}, {\sc
Set-Splitting}, {\sc Betweenness} and {\sc Max Acyclic Subgraph}. As a result,
all the parameterized problems we consider in this paper admit $2^{O(k)}$-time
algorithms.
  We also obtain non-trivial hybrid algorithms for every Max $c$-CSP: for every
instance $I$, we can either approximate $I$ beyond the random assignment
threshold in polynomial time, or we can find an optimal solution to $I$ in
subexponential time.

dimensionality, trap parameters, and particle numbers relevant to recent
experiments. At any barrier height we are able to discern between a two-mode
state and a state which is described sufficiently by mean field theory and,
further, give a criterion and technique for matching the two-mode theory to the
zero-barrier state. We compare the basis used in this model to the de-localized
basis functions underlying alternate models used in recent theoretical work on
the double-well splitting problem and show that only the generalized Wannier
basis displays the level crossing and emergence of two complex order parameters

the eavesdropper is assumed to have a strictly lower SNR compared to the

reconstruction at the intended receiver. In this work, it is shown that unlike
the Gaussian wiretap channel without side information, Shannon's source-channel
separation coding scheme is not optimum in the sense of achieving the minimum
distortion. Three hybrid digital-analog secure joint source channel coding
schemes are then proposed which achieve the minimum distortion. The first
coding scheme is based on Costa's dirty paper coding scheme and wiretap channel
coding scheme when the analog source is not explicitly quantized. The second
coding scheme is based on the superposition of the secure digital signal and
the hybrid digital-analog signal. It is shown that for the problem of
communicating a Gaussian source over a Gaussian wiretap channel with side

source-channel coding scheme. In the third coding scheme, the quantized signal
and the analog error signal are explicitly superimposed. It is shown that this
scheme provides an infinite family of optimum secure joint source-channel

secure hybrid digital-analog schemes are analyzed under the main channel SNR
mismatch. It is proven that the proposed schemes can give a graceful

assumption is that the distortions of spacetime which occur under extreme
conditions do not affect the field theory in any unexpected way. However, AdS
black holes are [to varying degrees] ""fragile"", in the sense that they become
unstable to stringy effects when their event horizons are sufficiently
distorted. This implies that field theories on curved backgrounds may likewise
be unstable in a suitable sense. We investigate this phenomenon, focussing on

states on polypeptide chain. The deduction of the folding rate formula in our
previous studies is reviewed. The rate formula is generalized to the case of
frequency variation in folding. Then the following problems about the
application of the rate theory are discussed: 1) The unified theory on the
two-state and multi-state protein folding is given based on the concept of
quantum transition. 2) The relationship of folding and unfolding rates vs
denaturant concentration is studied. 3) The temperature dependence of folding
rate is deduced and the non-Arrhenius behaviors of temperature dependence are
interpreted in a natural way. 4) The inertial moment dependence of folding rate
is calculated based on the model of dynamical contact order and consistent
results are obtained by comparison with one-hundred-protein experimental
dataset. 5) The exergonic and endergonic foldings are distinguished through the
comparison between theoretical and experimental rates for each protein. The
ultrafast folding problem is viewed from the point of quantum folding theory
and a new folding speed limit is deduced from quantum uncertainty relation. And
finally, 6) since only the torsion-accessible states are manageable in the
present formulation of quantum transition how the set of torsion-accessible
states can be expanded by using statistical energy landscape approach is
discussed. All above discussions support the view that the protein folding is
essentially a quantum transition between conformational states.

eigenfunctions on a space of generalized functions. The semigroup generated by
the linear operator is calculated by using the spectral decomposition to prove
the linear stability of a steady state of the system. The center manifold
theory is also developed on a space of generalized functions. It is proved that
there exists a finite dimensional center manifold on a space of generalized
functions, while a center manifold on a Hilbert space is of infinite
dimensional because of the continuous spectrum on the imaginary axis. The
results are applied to the stability and bifurcation theory of the Kuramoto
model to obtain a bifurcation diagram conjectured by Kuramoto. If the coupling
strength $K$ between oscillators is smaller than some threshold $K_c$, the
de-synchronous state proves to be asymptotically stable, and if $K$ exceeds
$K_c$, a nontrivial solution, which corresponds to the synchronization,
bifurcates from the de-synchronous state.

introduce multi-Dirac structures as a graded analog of standard Dirac

structures. Furthermore, we show that any multi-Dirac structure naturally gives
rise to a multi-Poisson bracket. We treat the case of field theories with

introduced by Ghosh, Roughgarden, and Sundararajan [STOC 2009]. These are
mechanisms that guarantee optimal utility to a large class of information
consumers, simultaneously, while preserving Differential Privacy [Dwork,
McSherry, Nissim, and Smith, TCC 2006]. Ghosh et al. have demonstrated, quite
surprisingly, a case where such a universally-optimal differentially-private
mechanisms exists, when the information consumers are Bayesian. This result was
recently extended by Gupte and Sundararajan [PODS 2010] to risk-averse
consumers.
  Both positive results deal with mechanisms (approximately) computing a single
count query (i.e., the number of individuals satisfying a specific property in
a given population), and the starting point of our work is a trial at extending
these results to similar settings, such as sum queries with non-binary
individual values, histograms, and two (or more) count queries. We show,
however, that universally-optimal mechanisms do not exist for all these
queries, both for Bayesian and risk-averse consumers.
  For the Bayesian case, we go further, and give a characterization of those
functions that admit universally-optimal mechanisms, showing that a
universally-optimal mechanism exists, essentially, only for a (single) count
query. At the heart of our proof is a representation of a query function $f$ by
its privacy constraint graph $G_f$ whose edges correspond to values resulting
by applying $f$ to neighboring databases.

they generate a strong magnetic field there. In the downstream region, these

associated with the energy stored in the electric dipole field, which turns out
to be only significant if the star possesses a sufficiently strong {\em net}

intriguing possibility of what happens when the electron layer (sphere) rotates
with respect to the stellar strange matter body. We find that in this event
magnetic fields can be generated which, for moderate effective rotational
frequencies between the electron layer and the stellar body, agree with the
magnetic fields inferred for several Central Compact Objects (CCOs). These

atmospheres rotate at frequencies that are moderately different ($\sim 10$ Hz)

While the capacity in the limit of disappearing SNR is known to be linear for
fading and non-fading channels, we study the problem of operating in low SNR
wireless network with given node locations that use network coding over flows.
The model we develop for low SNR Gaussian broadcast channel and multiple access
channel respectively operates in a non-trivial feasible rate region. We show
that the problem reduces to the optimization of total network power which can
be casted as standard linear multi-commodity min-cost flow program with no
inherent combinatorially difficult structure when network coding is used with
non integer constraints (which is a reasonable assumption). This is essentially
due to the linearity of the capacity with respect to vanishing SNR which helps
avoid the effect of interference for the degraded broadcast channel and
multiple access environment in consideration, respectively. We propose a fully
decentralized Primal-Dual Subgradient Algorithm for achieving optimal rates on
each subgraph (i.e. hyperarcs) of the network to support the set of traffic
demands (multicast/unicast connections).

number of leading monomial ideals with respect to degree orderings is finite;
(3) the number of leading monomial ideals with respect to admissible orderings

the topological properties of degree and admissible orderings in a class of

replaced with the concept of an event as a partition. The partition is any set

decomposition). Interpretation: elements inside certain part are
indistinguishable, while elements from different parts are distinguishable.
There are incompatible events, e.g {{e1},{e2}} and {{e1,e2}}. This is logical
incompatibility analogical to the impossibility to have and simultaneously not
to have the which-way information in the given experiment. The context is the
maximal set of mutually compatible events. Each experiment has associated its
context. In each context the extended probability is reduced to classical
probability. Then the quadratic representation of events, partitions and
probability measures is developed. At the end the central concept of quadratic

of the amino acid residues, the monomers of the protein, is dictated by the
sequence of codons (triplets of nucleotides) on a messenger RNA (mRNA) that
serves as the template. The ribosome is a molecular motor that utilizes the
template mRNA strand also as the track. Thus, in each step the ribosome moves
forward by one codon and, simultaneously, elongates the protein by one amino
acid. We present a theoretical model that captures most of the main steps in
the mechano-chemical cycle of a ribosome. The stochastic movement of the
ribosome consists of an alternating sequence of pause and translocation; the
sum of the durations of a pause and the following translocation is the time of
dwell of the ribosome at the corresponding codon. We derive the analytical
expression for the distribution of the dwell times of a ribosome in our model.
Whereever experimental data are available, our theoretical predictions are
consistent with those results. We suggest appropriate experiments to test the
new predictions of our model, particularly, the effects of the quality control
mechanism of the ribosome and that of their crowding on the mRNA track.

the hysteresis curves differently depending on whether the annealing is

(or flows) generally realized in the nuclei of radio galaxies and in further
lower mass-accretion rate nuclei are inner, hot, optically thin, radiatively
inefficient accretion flows (RIAFs) surrounded by outer, cool, optically thick,
standard type accretion disks. However, observational evidence for the
existence of such outer cool disks in these nuclei is rather poor. Instead,
recent observations sometimes suggest the existence of inner cool disks of
non-standard type, which develop in the region very close to their central
black holes. Taking NGC 4261 as a typical example of such light eating nuclei,
for which both flux data ranging from radio to X-ray and data for the
counterjet occultation are available, we examine the plausibility of such a
picture for the accretion states as mentioned above, based on model
predictions. It is shown that the explanation of the gap seen in the counterjet
emission in terms of the free-free absorption by an outer standard disk is
unrealistic, and moreover, the existence itself of such an outer standard disk
seems very implausible. Instead, the model of RIAF in an ordered magnetic field
(so called resistive RIAF model) can well serve to explain the emission gap in
terms of the synchrotron absorption, as well as to reproduce the observed
features of the overall spectral energy distribution (SED). This model also
predicts that the RIAF state starts directly from an interstellar hot gas phase
at around the Bondi radius and terminates at the inner edge whose radius is
about 100 times the Schwartzschild radii. Therefore, there is a good
possibility for a cool disk to develop within this innermost region.

the array and $\lambda$ the radiation wavelength. In the case of pulsar timing
arrays (PTAs) the array size is of order the pulsar-Earth distance (kpc) and
$\lambda$ is of order pc. Correspondingly, for point gravitational wave sources
closer than $\sim100$~Mpc the PTA response is sensitive to the source parallax
across the pulsar-Earth baseline. Here we evaluate the PTA response to
gravitational wave point sources including the important wavefront curvature
effects. Taking the wavefront curvature into account the relative amplitude and
phase of the timing residuals associated with a collection of pulsars allows us
to measure the distance to, and sky position of, the source.

0.02 RJ, a mass of 0.22 +/- 0.03 MJ, and therefore a mean density 1.6 +/- 0.1

density comparable to that of Neptune (1.76 g/cm^3). We estimate its content in
heavy elements to be 47-63 Earth masses, and the mass of its hydrogen-helium

CoRoT-8b should be no more than about 0.1 % over an assumed integrated lifetime

finite chain rings. Properties of skew constacyclic codes generated by monic
right divisors of $x^n-\lambda$, where $\lambda$ is a unit element, are
exhibited. When $\lambda^2=1$, the generators of Euclidean and Hermitian dual
codes of such codes are determined together with necessary and sufficient
conditions for them to be Euclidean and Hermitian self-dual. Of more interest
are codes over the ring $\mathbb{F}_{p^m}+u\mathbb{F}_{p^m}$. The structure of
all skew constacyclic codes is completely determined. This allows us to express
generators of Euclidean and Hermitian dual codes of skew cyclic and skew
negacyclic codes in terms of the generators of the original codes. An
illustration of all skew cyclic codes of length~2 over
$\mathbb{F}_{3}+u\mathbb{F}_{3}$ and their Euclidean and Hermitian dual codes

differentially rotating the inner and outer spheres. The fluid is also taken to
be electrically conducting (in the low magnetic Reynolds number limit), and a
magnetic field is imposed parallel to the axis of rotation. If the outer sphere
is stationary, the magnetic field induces a Shercliffe layer on the tangent
cylinder, the cylinder just touching the inner sphere and parallel to the
field. If the magnetic field is absent, but a strong overall rotation is
present, Coriolis effects induce a Stewartson layer on the tangent cylinder.
The non-axisymmetric instabilities of both types of layer separately have been
studied before; here we consider the two cases side by side, as well as the
mixed case, and investigate how magnetic and rotational effects interact. We
find that if the differential rotation and the overall rotation are in the same
direction, the overall rotation may have a destabilizing influence, whereas if
the differential rotation and the overall rotation are in the opposite
direction, the overall rotation always has a stabilizing influence.

  http://astro.u-strasbg.fr/~renaud/publi/thesis_FR.pdf",,,,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In interacting galaxies, strong tidal forces disturb the global morphology of
the progenitors and give birth to the long stellar, gaseous and dusty tails
often observed. In addition to this destructive effect, tidal forces can morph
into a transient, protective setting called compressive mode. Such modes then
shelter the matter in their midst by increasing its gravitational binding
energy. This thesis focuses on the study of this poorly known regime by
quantifying its properties thanks to numerical and analytical tools applied to
a spectacular merging system of two galaxies, commonly known as the Antennae
galaxies. N-body simulations of this pair yield compressive modes in the
regions where observations reveal a burst of star formation. Furthermore,
characteristic time- and energy scales of these modes match well those of
self-gravitating substructures such as star clusters and tidal dwarf galaxies.
These results suggest that the compressive modes of tidal fields plays an
important role in the formation and evolution of young clusters, at least in a
statistical sense, over a lapse of ~10 million years. Preliminary results from
simulations of stellar associations highlight the importance of embedding the
clusters in the evolving background galaxies to account precisely for their
morphology and internal evolution.
