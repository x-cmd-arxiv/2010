spin-transfer-torque in spin-valves with perpendicular materials have been
systematically studied by means of full micromagnetic simulations. In the
system we studied, depending on the working point (bias field and current) in
the dynamical stability diagram, we observe either resonant switching and
injection locking. The resonant switching, observed in the switching region,
occurs when the field frequency is approaching the frequency of the main
pre-switching mode giving rise to an asymmetric power distribution of that mode
in the sectional area of the free layer. At the resonant frequency, the
switching time is weakly dependent on the relative phase between the instant
when the current pulse is applied and the microwave field. The injection
locking, observed in the dynamical region, is characterized by the following
properties: (i) a locking bandwidth which is linearly dependent on the force
locking, and (ii) a locking for integer harmonics of the self-oscillation
frequency. We compare our numerical results with analytical theory for
non-autonomous non-linear system obtaining a good agreement in the current
region where the oscillation frequency and output power are characterized from
a linear relationship.

After accounting for observational measurement uncertainty, we find that the
mean relation defined by the E and S galaxies must also have an intrinsic or
""cosmic"" scatter of +-0.2 in either logN_GC or logM_BH. The residuals from this
correlation show no trend with globular cluster specific frequency. We suggest
that these two types of galaxy subsystems (central black hole and globular

redshift during the main epoch of hierarchical merging, and both require
extremely high-density conditions for formation. Lastly, we note that roughly
10% of the galaxies in our sample (one E, one S, and two S0) deviate strongly

collisions. The sQGP may have a very small viscosity (``perfect liquid'').
  However, other analysis methods provide contradictory evidence. Two-component
analysis of single-particle hadron spectra reveals a spectrum hard component

masquerade as ``radial flow'' in some hydro-motivated analysis. Minimum-bias

near transparency to partons.

is similar to what found in the population of long GRBs and it is in agreement

in terms of a scalar conformal equation, gauged by the field of a D3 brane
whose transversal dimensions have been conformally warpped over R^1xS^3. Such a
system does not result exactly conformally invariant because the gauge
potential slightly modifies the conformal centrifugal barrier of the free

in the P11-S11 pairs through the N spectrum as a combined effect of conformal
symmetry breaking, on the one side, and a parity change of the diquark from a
scalar at low masses, to a pseudoscalar at higher masses, on the other. We
calculate the number of resonances with masses below 2500 MeV needed for the
completeness of the above scheme and find a total of 32 ""missing"" nucleon and
Delta states. Their absence or presence in the respective spectra relates to
the degree to which conformal symmetry is realized in the lightest flavor

an effective instantaneous gluon propagator from the Fourier transform of the

hole. Plausible kinematic models are used to constrain the size of the broad
line region (BELR) in NGC 3998 by modeling the shape of the broad H-alpha,
H-beta and H-gamma emission line profiles. The analysis indicates that the BELR
is large with an outer radius ~7 pc, regardless of whether the kinematic model
is represented by an accretion disk or a spherically symmetric inflow. The
electron temperature in the BELR is < 28,800 K consistent with photoionization
by the AGN. Indeed, the AGN is able to sustain the ionization of the BELR,
albeit with a high covering factor ranging between 20% and 100% depending on
the spectral energy distribution adopted for the AGN. The high covering factor
favors a spherical distribution for the gas as opposed to a thin disk. If the

different countries host different stages of terrorist operations. Often the
recruits for the group come from one country or countries, while the targets of
the operations are in another. Stopping such attacks is difficult because
intervention in any region or route might merely shift the terrorists
elsewhere. Here we propose a model of transnational terrorism based on the
theory of activity networks. The model represents attacks on different
countries as paths in a network. The group is assumed to prefer paths of lowest
cost (or risk) and maximal yield from attacks. The parameters of the model are
computed for the Islamist-Salafi terrorist movement based on open source data
and then used for estimation of risks of future attacks. The central finding is
that the USA has an enduring appeal as a target, due to lack of other nations
of matching geopolitical weight or openness. It is also shown that countries in
Africa and Asia that have been overlooked as terrorist bases may become highly
significant threats in the future. The model quantifies the dilemmas facing
countries in the effort to cut such networks, and points to a limitation of
deterrence against transnational terrorists.

dimension 6 operator suppressed by the unification scale 10^16 GeV, while such
decay operators do not necessarily involve only leptons. In addition, the
scenario would be spoiled if there exist lower-dimensional operators inducing
the dark matter decay. We show in this letter that a single non-Abelian
discrete symmetry such as A_4 is possible to prohibit all such harmful
(non-leptonically coupled and lower-dimensional) operators. Moreover, the dark
matter decays into charged leptons in a flavor-blind fashion due to the
non-Abelian flavor symmetry, which results in perfect agreements not only with
the PAMELA data but also with the latest Fermi-LAT data reported very recently.

the classical Gauss collocation formula of order 2s, where s denotes the number

non-gravitational processes (e.g., radiative cooling, star formation, and/or
feedback) has had a relatively larger effect on groups. In the present study,
we compare a number of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations that form part of
the OverWhelmingly Large Simulations project to isolate and quantify the
effects of cooling and feedback from supernovae (SNe) and active galactic
nuclei (AGN) on the gas. This is achieved by comparing Lagrangian thermal
histories of the gas in the different runs, which were all started from
identical initial conditions. While radiative cooling, star formation, and SN
feedback are all necessary ingredients, only runs that also include AGN
feedback are able to successfully reproduce the optical and X-ray properties of

heated by AGN. Interestingly, we find that the gas that constitutes the

median density/high median entropy of the gas in present-day groups is achieved
by the ejection of lower entropy gas from low-mass progenitor galaxies at high

we find a difference of \sim 8.09 \pm 2.88e-4 between these observations and
observations at a longer wavelength that probes the K I wing (777.36 nm). While
the presence of red noise in the transit data has a non-negligible effect on
the uncertainties in the flux ratio, the 777.36-769.91 nm colour during transit
shows no effects from red noise and also indicates a significant colour change,
with a mean value of \sim 8.99\pm0.62e-4. This large change in the colour is
equivalent to a \sim 4.2% change in the apparent planetary radius with
wavelength, which is much larger than the atmospheric scale height. This
implies the observations probed the atmosphere at very low pressures as well as
a dramatic change in the pressure at which the slant optical depth reaches
unity between \sim770 and 777 nm. We hypothesize that the excess absorption may
be due to K I in a high-speed wind being driven from the exoplanet's exosphere.
We discuss the viability of this and alternative interpretations, including
stellar limb darkening, starspots, and effects from Earth's atmosphere. We

distort the Jahn-Teller relaxation and enhance the reconstruction bonds. This
increases the energy splitting of the quantum states and reduces the energy of
formation to as low as 1 eV per defect in the smallest nanocrystals. In

matches the symmetry expected for bulk Ge crystals. Near the nanocrystal's

the polycrystalline and amorphous regimes is determined by the attenuation
length of Bragg scattering, which depends not only on the degree of positional

whether or not the empirical spectral measures of typical matrices converge to
a limiting spectral measure as N --> oo. While this has been proved for many
thin patterned ensembles sitting inside all real symmetric matrices, frequently
there is no nice closed form expression for the limiting measure. Further,
current theorems provide few pictures of transitions between ensembles. We
consider the ensemble of symmetric m-block circulant matrices with entries
i.i.d.r.v. These matrices have toroidal diagonals periodic of period m. We view
m as a ""dial"" we can ""turn"" from the thin ensemble of symmetric circulant
matrices, whose limiting eigenvalue density is a Gaussian, to all real
symmetric matrices, whose limiting eigenvalue density is a semi-circle. The
limiting eigenvalue densities f_m show a visually stunning convergence to the
semi-circle as m tends to infinity, which we prove. In contrast to most studies
of patterned matrix ensembles, our paper gives explicit closed form expressions
for the densities. We prove that f_m is the product of a Gaussian and a degree
2m-2 polynomial; the formula equals that of the m x m Gaussian Unitary Ensemble
(GUE). The proof is by the moments. The new feature, which allows us to obtain
closed form expressions, is converting the central combinatorial problem in the
moment calculation into an equivalent counting problem in algebraic topology.
We end with a generalization of the m-block circulant pattern, dropping the
assumption that the m random variables be distinct. We prove that the limiting
spectral distribution exists and is determined by the pattern of the
independent elements within an m-period, depending on not only the frequency at
which each element appears, but also the way the elements are arranged.

desired sensitivity of the SM matter spectrum to the GUT symmetry breakdown at
the renormalizable level. We put the qualitative argument that a successful fit

strict no-go obtained for the fits of the charged sector observables in case of
a single active matter 10 is relaxed if a second vector multiplet is added to
the matter sector and excellent, though non-trivial, fits can be devised.

Superconducting rings have states with uniform phase windings that are integer
multiples of 2$\pi$ called fluxoid states. When the energy difference between
these fluxoid states is of order the temperature so that phase slips are
energetically accessible, several states contribute to the ring's magnetic
response to a flux threading the ring in thermal equilibrium and cause a
suppression or downturn in the ring's magnetic susceptibility as a function of
temperature. We review the theoretical framework for superconducting
fluctuations in rings including a model developed by Koshnick$^1$ which
includes only fluctuations in the ring's phase winding number called fluxoid
fluctuations and a complete model by von Oppen and Riedel$^2$ that includes all
thermal fluctuations in the Ginzburg-Landau framework. We show that for
sufficiently narrow and dirty rings the two models predict a similar
susceptibility response with a slightly shifted Tc indicating that fluxoid
fluctuations are dominant. Finally we present magnetic susceptibility data for
rings with different physical parameters which demonstrate the applicability of
our models. The susceptibility data spans a region in temperature where the
ring transitions from a hysteretic to a non hysteretic response to a periodic
applied magnetic field. The magnetic susceptibility data, taken where
transitions between fluxoid states are slow compared to the measurement time
scale and the ring response was hysteretic, decreases linearly with increasing
temperature resembling a mean field response with no fluctuations. At higher
temperatures where fluctuations begin to play a larger role a crossover occurs
and the non-hysteretic data shows a fluxoid fluctuation induced suppression of
diamagnetism below the mean field response that agrees well with the models.

almost-complex and smooth manifolds. More precisely, we show that, for an
almost-complex manifold $M^{2mn}$(resp. a smooth manifold $N^{4mn}$), if there
exists a partition $\lambda=(\lambda_{1},...,\lambda_{u})$ of weight $m$ such
that the Chern number $(c_{\lambda_{1}}... c_{\lambda_{u}})^{n}[M]$ (resp.
Pontrjagin number $(p_{\lambda_{1}}... p_{\lambda_{u}})^{n}[N]$) is nonzero,
then \emph{any} circle action on $M^{2mn}$ (resp. $N^{4mn}$) has at least $n+1$
fixed points. When an even-dimensional smooth manifold $N^{2n}$ admits a
semi-free action with isolated fixed points, we show that $N^{2n}$ bounds,
which generalizes a well-known fact in the free case. We also provide a
topological obstruction, in terms of the first Chern class, to the existence of
semi-free circle action with \emph{nonempty} isolated fixed points on
almost-complex manifolds. The main ingredients of our proofs are Bott's residue
formula and rigidity theorem.

approach to a superconducting system in a magnetic field. Two inequivalent
energy bands with different topology of Fermi surface cavities overlapping on

method allows us to compute $J$ numerically for much larger distances than can

avoids the use of a cutoff function often invoked in the literature to curtail
the diverging contributions from the linear bands and yields results that are

oscillatory factor that were previously missed in the literature. The main
features of the RKKY interaction in graphene are that unlike the $J \propto
(2k_FR)^{-2} \sin (2k_FR) $ behavior of an ordinary 2D metal in the
long-distance limit, $J$ in graphene falls off as $1/R^3$, shows the $1 + \cos
((K-K').R)$-type oscillations with additional phase factors depending on the
direction, and exhibits a ferromagnetic interaction for moments on the same
sublattice and an antiferromagnetic interaction for moments on the opposite
sublattices as required by particle-hole symmetry. The computed $J$ with the

are real, the Lyman alpha luminosity function (LF) at z=7 shows a significant
deficit from the LF at z=5.7 determined by previous surveys. The LAE number and
Lyman alpha luminosity densities at z=7 is ~ 7.7-54% and ~5.5-39% of those at
z=5.7 to the Lyman alpha line luminosity limit of L(Ly-alpha) >~ 9.2 x 10^{42}

evolves from z=5.7 to 7. However, even after correcting for this effect of
galaxy evolution on the decrease in LAE number density, the z=7 Lyman alpha LF
still shows a deficit from z=5.7 LF. This might reflect the attenuation of
Lyman alpha emission by neutral hydrogen remaining at the epoch of reionization
and suggests that reionization of the universe might not be complete yet at
z=7. If we attribute the density deficit to reionization, the intergalactic

described by a multi-branched wave- function, with the corresponding
wave-packets occupying separated regions of the time-space, a frequently asked
question is whether the quantum object is actually contained in only one of
these wave-packets. If the answer is positive, then the other wave-packets are
called in literature empty waves. The wave-packet containing the object is
called a full wave, and is the only one that would produce a recording in a
detector. A question immediately arising is whether the empty waves may also
have an observable effect. Different works were dedicated to the elucidation of
this question. None of them proved that the hypothesis of full/empty waves is
correct - it may be that the Nature is indeed non-deterministic and the quantum
object is not confined to one region of the space-time. All the works that
proved that the empty waves have an effect, in fact, proved that if there exist
full and empty waves, then the latter may have an observable effect. This is
also the purpose and the limitation of the present work. What is shown here is
that if the hypothesis is true, the empty waves have an influence. An
experiment is indicated which reveals this influence. The analysis of the
experiment is according to the quantum formalism. This experiment has the
advantage of being more intuitive and practically more feasible than a previous
proposal also in agreement with the quantum formalism. However, the presently
proposed experiment also shows that the quantum theory is not in favor of the
above hypothesis.

intrinsic noise. We model the population dynamics in a ""refuge"" as a Markov
process which involves births and deaths on discrete lattice sites and random
migrations between neighboring sites. In extinction scenario I the zero
population size is a repelling fixed point of the on-site deterministic
dynamics. In extinction scenario II the zero population size is an attracting
fixed point, corresponding to what is known in ecology as Allee effect.
Assuming a large population size, we develop WKB (Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin)
approximation to the master equation. The resulting Hamilton's equations encode
the most probable path of the population toward extinction and the mean time to
extinction. In the fast-migration limit these equations coincide, up to a
canonical transformation, with those obtained, in a different way, by Elgart
and Kamenev (2004). We classify possible regimes of population extinction with
and without an Allee effect and for different types of refuge and solve several
examples analytically and numerically. For a very strong Allee effect the
extinction problem can be mapped into the over-damped limit of theory of
homogeneous nucleation due to Langer (1969). In this regime, and for very long
systems, we predict an optimal refuge size that maximizes the mean time to
extinction.

proposed as a universal resource for continuous-variable quantum computing. A
central aim is to compare mathematically-idealized cluster states defined using
quadrature eigenstates, which have infinite squeezing and cannot exist in
nature, with Gaussian approximations which are experimentally accessible.
Adopting widely-used definitions, we first review the key concepts, by
analysing a process of teleportation along a continuous-variable quantum wire
in the language of matrix product states. Next we consider the bipartite
entanglement properties of the wire, providing analytic results. We proceed to
grid cluster states, which are universal for the qubit case. To extend our
analysis of the bipartite entanglement, we adopt the entropic-entanglement
width, a specialized entanglement measure introduced recently by Van den Nest M
et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 97 150504 (2006), adapting their definition to the
continuous-variable context. Finally we add the effects of photonic loss,
extending our arguments to mixed states. Cumulatively our results point to key
differences in the properties of idealized and Gaussian cluster states. Even
modest loss rates are found to strongly limit the amount of entanglement. We
discuss the implications for the potential of continuous-variable analogues of
measurement-based quantum computation.

the continuum it is related to the standard SF by a non-singlet chiral field
rotation and therefore referred to as the chirally rotated SF ($\chi$SF). On
the lattice with Wilson fermions the relation is not exact, suggesting some
interesting tests of universality. The main advantage of the $\chi$SF consists
in its compatibility with the mechanism of automatic O($a$) improvement. In
this paper the basic set-up is introduced and discussed. Chirally rotated SF
boundary conditions are implemented on the lattice using an orbifold
construction. The lattice symmetries imply a list of counterterms, which
determine how the action and the basic fermionic two-point functions are
renormalised and O($a$) improved. As with the standard SF, a logarithmically
divergent boundary counterterm leads to a multiplicative renormalisation of the
fermionic boundary fields. In addition, a finite dimension 3 boundary
counterterm must be tuned in order to preserve the chirally rotated boundary
conditions in the interacting theory. Once this is achieved, O($a$) effects
originating from the bulk action or from insertions of composite operators in
the bulk can be avoided by the mechanism of automatic O($a$) improvement. The
remaining O($a$) effects arise from the boundaries and can be cancelled by
tuning a couple of O($a$) boundary counterterms. The general results are
illustrated in the free theory where the Sheikholeslami-Wohlert term is shown
to affect correlation functions only at O($a^2$), irrespective of its
coefficient.

CMEs, which, however, has been largely unknown for CMEs originating from active
regions. In this paper, selected for studying are 16 active-region coronal
arcades whose gradual inflation lead up to CMEs. 12 of them clearly build upon
post-eruptive arcades resulting from a preceding eruption. The observed
inflation sustains for 8.7 +/- 4.1 h, with the arcade rising from 1.15 +/- 0.06
Rsun to 1.36 +/- 0.07 Rsun within the EIT field of view (FOV). The rising speed
is less than 5 km s-1 for most of the time. Only at the end of this
quasi-static stage, it increases to tens of kilometers per second over tens of
minutes. The arcade then erupts out of the EIT FOV as a CME with similar
morphology. This pre-CME structure is apparently unaffected by the flares
occurring during its quasi-static inflation phase, but is closely coupled with
the flare occurring during its acceleration phase. For four events that were
observed on the disk, it is found that the gradual inflation of the arcade is
accompanied by significant helicity injection from photosphere. In particular,
a swirling structure, which is reminiscent of a magnetic flux rope, was
observed in one of the arcades over 4 h prior to the subsequent CME, and the
growth of the arcade is associated with the injection of helicity of opposite
sense into the active region via flux emergence. We propose a four-phase
evolution paradigm for the observed CMEs, i.e., a quasi-static inflation phase
which corresponds to the buildup of magnetic free energy in the corona,
followed by the frequently observed three-phase paradigm, including an initial
phase, an acceleration phase and a gradual phase.

single electron transistor as a charge detector in a single layer graphene. The
high charge sensitivity of the detector is used to probe Coulomb diamonds as
well as excited spectrum in the dot, even in the regime where the current
through the quantum dot is too small to be measured by conventional transport
means. The graphene based quantum dot and integrated charge sensor serve as an
essential building block to form a solid-state qubit in a nuclear-spin-free
quantum world.

containing one scalar SU(2)_L doublet, one real triplet, and one complex
triplet with hypercharge 1. Because the two triplets contribute to the rho
parameter with opposite signs, the triplet vacuum expectation values can be
sizable. We show that (i) the hWW and hZZ couplings can be larger than the
corresponding values in the Standard Model, and (ii) the ratio of the WW and ZZ
couplings of h can be different than the corresponding ratio in the Standard
Model. Neither of these results can occur in models containing only Higgs
doublets. We also compute the rates for gg --> h --> WW and gg --> h --> ZZ and
find that, for reasonable parameter values and M_h ~ 140-180 GeV, the hadron
collider rate for gg --> h --> WW (ZZ) can be up to 20% (5 times) larger than
in the Standard Model. We discuss implications for Higgs coupling extraction at
the LHC.

applications. Several approximations for this norm with differing complexity
and accuracy have been proposed in the literature. Earlier approaches were
based on minimizing the maximum error. Recently, Seol and Cheun proposed an
approximation based on minimizing the average error. In this paper, we first
examine these approximations in detail, show that they fit into a single
mathematical formulation, and compare their average and maximum errors. We then
show that the maximum errors given by Seol and Cheun are significantly
optimistic.

  (IJCSIT) Vol.2, No.4, August 2010",,,"cs.CR cs.NE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/","  Problem statement: This paper examines Artificial Spiking Neural Network
(ASNN) which inter-connects group of artificial neurons that uses a
mathematical model with the aid of block cipher. The aim of undertaken this
research is to come up with a block cipher where by the keys are randomly
generated by ASNN which can then have any variable block length. This will show
the private key is kept and do not have to be exchange to the other side of the
communication channel so it present a more secure procedure of key scheduling.
The process enables for a faster change in encryption keys and a network level
encryption to be implemented at a high speed without the headache of
factorization. Approach: The block cipher is converted in public cryptosystem
and had a low level of vulnerability to attack from brute, and moreover can
able to defend against linear attacks since the Artificial Neural Networks
(ANN) architecture convey non-linearity to the encryption/decryption
procedures. Result: In this paper is present to use the Spiking Neural Networks
(SNNs) with spiking neurons as its basic unit. The timing for the SNNs is
considered and the output is encoded in 1's and 0's depending on the occurrence
or not occurrence of spikes as well as the spiking neural networks use a sign
function as activation function, and present the weights and the filter
coefficients to be adjust, having more degrees of freedom than the classical
neural networks. Conclusion: In conclusion therefore, encryption algorithm can
be deployed in communication and security applications where data transfers are
most crucial. So this paper, the neural block cipher proposed where the keys
are generated by the SNN and the seed is considered the public key which
generates the both keys on both sides In future therefore a new research will
be conducted on the Spiking Neural Network (SNN) impacts on communication.

transformations of two-dimensional torus is studied on a discrete lattice and
compared with that of conservative hyperbolic automorphisms of the torus.
Applying dissipative dynamical systems to generation of pseudorandom numbers is
shown to be advantageous and equidistribution of probabilities for the
sequences of bits can be achieved. A new algorithm for generating uniform
pseudorandom numbers is proposed. The theory of the generator, which includes
proofs of periodic properties and of statistical independence of bits at
distances up to logarithm of mesh size, is presented. Extensive statistical
testing using available test packages demonstrates excellent results, while the
speed of the generator is comparable to other modern generators.

secondary users (SUs) to minimize their interference with the primary users

relaxation factor as a reference path which is contingent on the states of the
PUs. Along the axis, we construct a hierarchical structure for multiple sources
to reach cognitive pilot channel (CPC) base stations. We use a temporal and
spatial dynamic non-cooperative game to model the interactions among SUs as
well as their influences from PUs in the multi-hop structure of the network. A
multi-stage fictitious play learning is used for distributed routing in
multi-hop CR networks. We obtain a set of mixed (behavioral) Nash equilibrium
strategies of the dynamic game in closed form by backward induction. The
proposed algorithm minimizes the overall interference and the average packet
delay along the routing path from SU nodes to CPC base stations in an optimal
and distributed manner
