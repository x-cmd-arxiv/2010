reconstruction of quantum states from incomplete measurement data. Outside the
macroscopic realm, however, estimating a Gibbs state is a nontrivial inference
task, due to two complicating factors: the proper set of relevant observables
might not be evident a priori; and whenever data are gathered from a small
sample only, the best estimate for the Lagrange parameters is invariably
affected by the experimenter's prior bias. I show how the two issues can be
tackled with the help of Bayesian model selection and Bayesian interpolation,
respectively, and illustrate the use of these Bayesian techniques with a number

in radiation physics of charged particles and is still a useful tool to
estimate the range RCSDA of approximately monoenergetic protons with initial
energy E0 in a homogeneous medium. The rule is based on the
continuous-slowing-down-approximation (CSDA). It results from a generalized
(nonrelativistic) Langevin equation and a modification of the phenomenological
friction term. The complete integration of this equation provides information
about the residual energy E(z) and dE(z)/dz at each position z (0 <= z <=
RCSDA). A relativistic extension of the generalized Langevin equation yields
the formula RCSDA = A dot (E0 +E02/2M dot c2)p. The initial energy of
therapeutic protons satisfies E0 << 2M dot c2 (M dot c2 = 938.276 MeV), which
enables us to consider the relativistic contributions as correction terms.
Besides this phenomenological starting-point, a complete integration of the
Bethe-Bloch equation (BBE) is developed, which also provides the determination
of RCSDA, E(z) and dE(z)/dz and uses only those parameters given by the BBE
itself (i.e., without further empirical parameters like modification of
friction). The results obtained in the context of the aforementioned methods
are compared with Monte-Carlo calculations (GEANT4); this Monte-Carlo code is
also used with regard to further topics such as lateral scatter, nuclear
interactions, and buildup effects. In the framework of the CSDA, the energy
transfer from protons to environmental atomic electrons does not account for
local fluctuations.

univariate component function $f^*_j$ lies in a reproducing kernel Hilbert
space (RKHS), and analyze a method for estimating the unknown function $f^*$
based on kernels combined with $\ell_1$-type convex regularization. Working
within a high-dimensional framework that allows both the dimension $d$ and
sparsity $s$ to increase with $n$, we derive convergence rates (upper bounds)
in the $L^2(\mathbb{P})$ and $L^2(\mathbb{P}_n)$ norms over the class
$\MyBigClass$ of sparse additive models with each univariate function $f^*_j$
in the unit ball of a univariate RKHS with bounded kernel function. We
complement our upper bounds by deriving minimax lower bounds on the
$L^2(\mathbb{P})$ error, thereby showing the optimality of our method. Thus, we
obtain optimal minimax rates for many interesting classes of sparse additive
models, including polynomials, splines, and Sobolev classes. We also show that
if, in contrast to our univariate conditions, the multivariate function class
is assumed to be globally bounded, then much faster estimation rates are
possible for any sparsity $s = \Omega(\sqrt{n})$, showing that global
boundedness is a significant restriction in the high-dimensional setting.

because of the optically anisotropic magnetoelectric response induced in the

derivation (corrected of trivial mistakes), we rederive the same result by a

stress exerted by the vacuum on the fluid which, if the Feigel hypothesis is
correct, should induce a Poiseuille flow in a tube with maximum speed $\approx
100\mu$m/s (2000 times larger than Feigel's original prediction). An experiment
is suggested to test this prediction for an organometallic fluid in a tube
passing through the bore of a high strength magnet. The predicted flow can be
measured directly by tracking microscopy or indirectly by measuring the flow
rate ($\approx 1$ml/min) corresponding to the Poiseuille flow. A second
experiment is also proposed whereby a `vacuum radiometer' is used to test a
recent prediction that the net force on a magnetoelectric slab in the vacuum
should be zero.

excitations of a spin polarized two-dimensional electron gas in a CdMnTe
quantum well using resonant Raman scattering. We find the energy of the
spin-flip wave to be below the spin-flip single particle excitation continuum,
a contradiction to the theory of spin waves in diluted magnetic semiconductors
put forth in [Phys. Rev. B 70, 045205 (2004)]. We show that the inclusion of
terms accounting for the Coulomb interaction between carriers in the spin wave
propagator leads to an agreement with our experimental results. The dominant
Coulomb contribution leads to an overall red shift of the mixed electron-Mn
spin modes while the dynamical coupling between Mn ions results in a small blue
shift. We provide a simulated model system which shows the reverse situation
but at an extremely large magnetic field.

(Bloch brane model). In this meritorious research the simplest Yukawa coupling
$\eta\bar{\Psi}\phi\chi\Psi$ was considered. In that work does not analyze the

problem of fermion localization for some other Yukawa couplings are analyzed.
It is shown that the zero mode for left-handed and right-handed fermions can be
localized on the brane depending on the values for the coupling constant $\eta$
and the Bloch brane's parameter $a$.

has regret $14\epsilon T $ and loss $2\sqrt{T}e^{-\epsilon^2 T} $ in

is optimal up to constant factors.
  Our techniques extend to the general setting of $N$ experts, where the
related problem of trading off regret to the best expert for regret to the
`special' expert has been studied by Even-Dar et al. (COLT'07). We obtain
essentially zero loss with respect to the special expert and optimal
loss/regret tradeoff, improving upon the results of Even-Dar et al and settling
the main question left open in their paper.
  The strong loss bounds of the algorithm have some surprising consequences. A
simple iterative application of our algorithm gives essentially optimal regret
bounds at multiple time scales, bounds with respect to $k$-shifting optima as
well as regret bounds with respect to higher norms of the input sequence.

overlay systems i.e. interworking of WLAN/ GSM/ CDMA/ WiMAX/ LTE/ etc with
guaranteed Quality of Service (QoS) and Experience (QoE).QoS(E) vary from
network to network and is application sensitive. User needs an optimal mobility
solution while roaming in Overlaid wireless environment i.e. user could
seamlessly transfer his session/ call to a best available network bearing
guaranteed Quality of Experience. And If this Seamless transfer of session is
executed between two networks having different access standards then it is
called Vertical Handover (VHO). Contemporary VHO decision algorithms are based
on generic QoS metrics viz. SNR, bandwidth, jitter, BER and delay. In this
paper, Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) is proposed to be a generic QoS trigger for
VHO execution. EVM is defined as the deviation of inphase/ quadrature (I/Q)
values from ideal signal states and thus provides a measure of signal quality.
In 4G Interoperable environment, OFDM is the leading Modulation scheme (more
prone to multi-path fading). EVM (modulation error) properly characterises the
wireless link/ channel for accurate VHO decision. EVM depends on the inherent
transmission impairments viz. frequency offset, phase noise,
non-linear-impairment, skewness etc. for a given wireless link. Paper provides
an insight to the analytical aspect of EVM & measures EVM (%) for key
management subframes like association/re-association/disassociation/ probe
request/response frames. EVM relation is explored for different possible
NAV-Network Allocation Vectors (frame duration). Finally EVM is compared with
SNR, BER and investigation concludes EVM as a promising QoS trigger for OFDM
based emerging wireless standards.

their signs during the chiral phase transition and the fourth-order

sum the entropies. It is further shown that summing entropies according to the
Planck-Boltzmann (P-B) definition of entropy is formally the same as ISS, which
is why ISS works. Approximate values of the probabilities of fatality are used
to calculate the Gibb's entropy, which is more accurate than the P-B entropy
far from equilibrium, and are shown to be again proportional to ISS. For the
categorisation of injury using entropies it is necessary to consider the
underlying entropy of the individuals morbidity to which is added the entropy
of trauma, which then may result in death. Adding in the underlying entropy and
summing entropies of all AIS3+ values gives a more extended scale than ISS, and
so entropy is considered the preferred measure. A small scale trial is
conducted of these concepts using the APROSYS In-Depth Pedestrian database, and
the differences between the measures are illustrated. It is shown that adopting
an entropy approach to categorising injury severity highlights the position of
the elderly, who have a reduced physiological reserve to resist further
traumatic onslaught. There are other informational entropy-like measures, here
called i-entropy, which can also be used to classify injury severity, which are
outlined. A large scale trial of these various entropy or i-entropy measures
needs to be conducted to assess the usefulness of the measures. In the

model of social influence in which an individual adopts the opinion shared by
the majority of the members of its extended neighborhood, which includes the
individual itself. This is a variant of the majority-vote model in which the
individual retains its opinion in case there is a tie among the neighbors'
opinions. We assume that the individuals are fixed in the sites of a square
lattice of linear size $L$ and that they interact with their nearest neighbors
only.
  Within a mean-field framework, we derive the equations of motion for the
density of individuals adopting a particular opinion in the single-site and
pair approximations. Although the single-site approximation predicts a single
opinion domain that takes over the entire lattice, the pair approximation
yields a qualitatively correct picture with the coexistence of different
opinion domains and a strong dependence on the initial conditions. Extensive
Monte Carlo simulations indicate the existence of a rich distribution of
opinion domains or clusters, the number of which grows with $L^2$ whereas the
size of the largest cluster grows with $\ln L^2$. The analysis of the sizes of
the opinion domains shows that they obey a power-law distribution for not too
large sizes but that they are exponentially distributed in the limit of very
large clusters. In addition, similarly to other well-known social influence
model -- Axelrod's model -- we found that these opinion domains are unstable to
the effect of a thermal-like noise.

nonstationary data that provides a localized time-frequency representation by
decomposing the data into adaptively defined modes. EMD can be used to estimate
a signal's instantaneous frequency (IF) but suffers from poor performance in
the presence of noise. To produce a meaningful IF, each mode of the
decomposition must be nearly monochromatic, a condition that is not guaranteed
by the algorithm and fails to be met when the signal is corrupted by noise. In
this work, the extraction of modes containing both signal and noise is
identified as the cause of poor IF estimation. The specific mechanism by which
such ""transition"" modes are extracted is detailed and builds on the observation
of Flandrin and Goncalves that EMD acts in a filter bank manner when analyzing
pure noise. The mechanism is shown to be dependent on spectral leak between
modes and the phase of the underlying signal. These ideas are developed through
the use of simple signals and are tested on a synthetic seismic waveform.

dissemination of culture - the Adaptive Culture Heuristic (ACH) - on solving an
NP-Complete optimization problem, namely, the classification of binary input
patterns of size $F$ by a Boolean Binary Perceptron. In this heuristic, $N$
agents, characterized by binary strings of length $F$ which represent possible
solutions to the optimization problem, are fixed at the sites of a square
lattice and interact with their nearest neighbors only. The interactions are
such that the agents' strings (or cultures) become more similar to the low-cost
strings of their neighbors resulting in the dissemination of these strings
across the lattice. Eventually the dynamics freezes into a homogeneous
absorbing configuration in which all agents exhibit identical solutions to the
optimization problem. We find through extensive simulations that the
probability of finding the optimal solution is a function of the reduced
variable $F/N^{1/4}$ so that the number of agents must increase with the fourth
power of the problem size, $N \propto F^ 4$, to guarantee a fixed probability
of success. In this case, we find that the relaxation time to reach an
absorbing configuration scales with $F^ 6$ which can be interpreted as the
overall computational cost of the ACH to find an optimal set of weights for a
Boolean Binary Perceptron, given a fixed probability of success.
