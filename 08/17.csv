with measurement models having only a single output quantity. However, in many
cases more than one output quantity is required, where all of them are related
to a common set of input quantities. In order to evaluate the measurement
uncertainties associated with estimated expectations of these output
quantities, the uncertainty propagation as treated in the GUM requires an
appropriate extension. This article will introduce the concept of the
multivariate uncertainty calculation as an extension of the univariate
uncertainty calculation.

give a characterization of relative $n$-convexity in terms of this measure, as

$n$-convexity of an $n$-convex function $f$ in terms of its derivative
$f^{(n+1)}(x)$ (which exists a.e.) without additional assumptions on

the support for the function $f$ in the sense introduced by Wasowicz (2007), up

study multiple episodes of jet activity in large-scale radio sources. We use
radio data from the Very Large Array and the literature to model two DDRGs,
B1450+333 and B1834+620, in terms of their dynamical evolution. We find that
the standard Fanaroff-Riley II model is able to explain the properties of the
two outer lobes of each source, whereby the lobes are formed by ram-pressure
balance of a shock at the end of the jet with the surrounding medium. The inner
pairs of lobes, however, are not well-described by the standard model. Instead
we interpret the inner lobes as arising from the emission of relativistic
electrons within the outer lobes, which are compressed and re-accelerated by
the bow-shock in front of the restarted jets and within the outer lobes. The
predicted rapid progression of the inner lobes through the outer lobes requires
the eventual development of a hotspot at the edge of the outer lobe, causing
the DDRG ultimately to resemble a standard Fanaroff-Riley II radio galaxy. This
may suggest that DDRGs are a brief, yet normal, phase of the evolution of
large-scale radio galaxies.

phenomenological fits to RXTE PCA data reveal a pulsation in the iron line at
the spin frequency of the neutron star. However, fitting more complex spectral
models reveals a degeneracy between iron-line pulsations and changes in the
underlying hotspot blackbody temperature with phase. By comparing with the
variations in reflection continuum, which are much weaker than the iron line
variations, we infer that the iron-line is not pulsed. The observed spectral
variations can be explained by variations in blackbody temperature associated
with rotational Doppler shifts at the neutron star surface. By allowing
blackbody temperature to vary in this way, we also find a larger phase-shift
between the pulsations in the Comptonised and blackbody components than has
been seen in previous work. The phase-shift between the pulsation in the
blackbody temperature and normalisation is consistent with a simple model where
the Doppler shift is maximised at the limb of the neutron star, ~90 degrees
prior to maximisation of the hot-spot projected area.

results show a correlation between AGN power (indicated by [OIII] 5007 emission
line luminosity) and 24 micron luminosity. This result is consistent with the
24 micron thermal emission originating from warm dust heated directly by AGN
illumination. Applying the same correlation test for 70 micron luminosity
against [OIII] luminosity we find this relation to suffer from increased
scatter compared to that of 24 micron. In line with our results for the
higher-radio-frequency-selected 2Jy sample, we are able to show that much of
this increased scatter is due to heating by starbursts which boost the
far-infrared emission at 70 micron in a minority of objects (17-35%). Overall
this study supports previous work indicating AGN illumination as the dominant
heating mechanism for MFIR emitting dust in the majority of low to intermediate
redshift radio galaxies (0.03<z<0.7), with the advantage of strong statistical
evidence. However, we find evidence that the low redshift broad-line objects

compound LaVO$_3$. We argue that the GdFeO$_3$ distortion and the large
difference in entropy of $C$-AF and $G$-AF phases is responsible for the second
magnetic transition observed at $T_{N2}$ in YVO$_3$. Next we address the
variation of orbital and magnetic transition temperature, $T_{\rm OO}$ and
$T_{N1}$, in the $R$VO$_3$ perovskites, after extending the spin-orbital model
by the crystal-field and the orbital interactions which arise from the
GdFeO$_3$ and Jahn-Teller distortions of the VO$_6$ octahedra. We further find
that the orthorhombic distortion which increases from LaVO$_3$ to LuVO$_3$
plays a crucial role by controlling the orbital fluctuations, and via the
modified orbital correlations influences the onset of both magnetic and orbital
order.

perturbative QCD (pQCD) in the leading order and up to the next-to-leading
order, respectively. For the relaxation time of charm and anticharm quarks in

multiplicative factors to the dissociation cross section of charmonia and the
elastic scattering cross sections of charm and anticharm quarks, we find that
this effect is small for the $R_{AA}$ of $J/\psi$ as they suppress the number
of initially produced $J/\psi$ but enhance the number of regenerated ones. The
higher-order corrections increase, however, the $v_2$ of $J/\psi$. Our results

spectra with matching IRS short-high (SH) and long-high (LH) aperture grid
patterns. Most previous IR missions observed only the inner few arcmin. Orion
is the benchmark for studies of the ISM particularly for elemental abundances.
Spitzer observations provide a unique perspective on the Ne and S abundances by
virtue of observing the dominant ionization states of Ne (Ne+, Ne++) and S
(S++, S3+) in Orion and H II regions in general. The Ne/H abundance ratio is
especially well determined, with a value of (1.01+/-0.08)E-4. We obtained
corresponding new ground-based spectra at CTIO. These optical data are used to
estimate the electron temperature, electron density, optical extinction, and
the S+/S++ ratio at each of our Spitzer positions. That permits an adjustment
for the total gas-phase S abundance because no S+ line is observed by Spitzer.
The gas-phase S/H abundance ratio is (7.68+/-0.30)E-6. The Ne/S abundance ratio
may be determined even when the weaker hydrogen line, H(7-6) here, is not
measured. The mean value, adjusted for the optical S+/S++ ratio, is Ne/S =
13.0+/-0.6. We derive the electron density versus distance from theta1OriC for
[S III] and [S II]. Both distributions are for the most part decreasing with
increasing distance. A dramatic find is the presence of high-ionization Ne++
all the way to the outer optical boundary ~12' from theta1OriC. This IR result
is robust, whereas the optical evidence from observations of high-ionization
species (e.g. O++) at the outer optical boundary suffers uncertainty because of
scattering of emission from the much brighter inner Huygens Region.

wealth of information on conditions in the solar nebula, if their formation
mechanism can be understood. The theory most consistent with observational
constraints, especially thermal histories, is the so-called ""shock model"", in
which chondrules were melted in solar nebula shocks. However, several problems
have been identified with previous shock models. These problems all pertained
to the treatment of the radiation field, namely the input boundary condition to
the radiation field, the proper treatment of the opacity of solids, and the
proper treatment of molecular line cooling. In this paper, we present the
results of our updated shock model, which corrects for the problems listed
above. Our new hydrodynamic shock code includes a complete treatment of
molecular line cooling due to H2O. Previously, shock models including line
cooling predicted chondrule cooling rates exceeding 100,000 K/hr. Contrary to
these expectations, we have found that the effect of line cooling is minimal;
after the inclusion of line cooling, the cooling rates of chondrules are
10-1000 K/hr. The reduction in the otherwise rapid cooling rates attributable
to line cooling is due to a combination of factors, including buffering due to
hydrogen recombination/dissociation, high column densities of water, and
backwarming. Our model demonstrates that the shock model for chondrule
formation remains consistent with observational constraints.

computationally inexpensive model for the description of the sea bed
displacement during an underwater earthquake, based on the finite fault
solution for the slip distribution under some assumptions on the dynamics of
the rupturing process. Once the bottom motion is reconstructed, we study waves
induced on the free surface of the ocean. For this purpose we consider three
different models approximating the Euler equations of the water wave theory.
Namely, we use the linearized Euler equations (we are in fact solving the
Cauchy-Poisson problem), a Boussinesq system and a novel weakly nonlinear
model. An intercomparison of these approaches is performed. The developments of
the present study are illustrated on the 17 July 2006 Java event, where an

an EM algorithm for estimating the PMOG model. Next, we show how the PMOG model
can be applied to the problem of blind source separation (BSS). In contrast to
conventional BSS where an objective function based on an approximation to
differential entropy is minimized, PMOG based BSS simply minimizes the
differential entropy of projected sources by fitting a flexible MOG model in
the projected 1-D space while simultaneously optimizing the projection vector
w. The advantage of PMOG over conventional BSS algorithms is the more flexible
fitting of non-Gaussian source densities without assuming near-Gaussianity (as
in conventional BSS) and still retaining computational feasibility.

objective function and impenetrability constraints can be exactly linearized
for sphere packings with a size distribution in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space
$\mathbb{R}^d$, it is most suitable and natural to solve the corresponding ASC
optimization problem using sequential linear programming (SLP) techniques. We
implement an SLP solution to produce robustly a wide spectrum of jammed sphere
packings in $\mathbb{R}^d$ for $d=2,3,4,5$ and $6$ with a diversity of disorder
and densities up to the maximally densities. This deterministic algorithm can
produce a broad range of inherent structures besides the usual disordered ones
with very small computational cost by tuning the radius of the {\it influence
sphere}. In three dimensions, we show that it can produce with high probability
a variety of strictly jammed packings with a packing density anywhere in the
wide range $[0.6, 0.7408...]$. We also apply the algorithm to generate various
disordered packings as well as the maximally dense packings for $d=2,3, 4,5$

the final packings are truly jammed, produces disordered jammed packings with
anomalously low densities, and is appreciably more robust and computationally
faster at generating maximally dense packings, especially as the space
dimension increases.

  *** Everything in the language is accomplished using message passing
including the very definition of ActorScript itself
  *** Functional, Imperative, Logic, and Concurrent programming are integrated.

  *** Programs do not expose low-level implementation mechanisms such as
threads, tasks, locks, cores, etc.
  *** Messages can be directly communicated without requiring indirection
through brokers, channels, class hierarchies, mailboxes, pipes, ports, queues
etc.
  *** Variable races are eliminated.
  *** Binary XML and JSON are data types.
  *** Application binary interfaces are afforded so that no identifier symbol

  - Safety and Security
  *** Programs are extension invariant, i.e., extending a program does not
change its meaning.

  - Performance
  *** Impose no overhead on implementation of Actor systems
  *** Message passing has essentially same overhead as procedure calling and
looping.

i.e., when it does not interleave the bits at all. In this paper, we give a
formal explanation for these results and show that BICM-T is in fact the
combination of a TCM transmitter and a BICM receiver. To predict the
performance of BICM-T, a new type of distance spectrum for convolutional codes
is introduced, analytical bounds based on this spectrum are developed, and
asymptotic approximations are also presented. It is shown that the minimum
distance of the code is not the relevant optimization criterion for BICM-T.
Optimal convolutional codes for different constrain lengths are tabulated and
asymptotic gains of about 2 dB are obtained. These gains are found to be the
same as those obtained by Ungerboeck's one-dimensional trellis coded modulation
(1D-TCM), and therefore, in nonfading channels, BICM-T is shown to be
asymptotically as good as 1D-TCM.

family of realistic triaxial potentials with central supermassive black holes

triaxiality) are associated with resonances which occupy two-dimensional
surfaces in configuration space. For slow figure rotation all orbit families
are largely stable. At intermediate pattern speeds a significant fraction of
the resonant box orbits as well as inner long-axis tubes are destabilized by
the ""envelope doubling"" that arises from the Coriolis forces and are driven
into the destabilizing center. Thus, for pattern rotation periods .2 Gyr < Tp <
5 Gyr, the two orbit families that are most important for maintaining
triaxiality are highly chaotic. As pattern speed increases there is also a
sharp decrease in the overall fraction of prograde short-axis tubes and a
corresponding increase in the retrograde variety. At the highest pattern speeds
(close to that of triaxial bars), box-like orbits undergo a sudden transition
to a new family of stable retrograde loop-like orbits, which resemble orbits in
three-dimensional bars, and circulate about the short axis. Our analysis
implies that triaxial systems (with central cusps and SMBHs) can either have
high pattern speeds like fast bars or low patten speeds like triaxial
elliptical galaxies or dark matter halos found in N-body simulations.
Intermediate pattern speeds produce a high level of stochasticity in both the
box and inner long-axis tube orbit families implying that stable triaxial
systems are unlikely to have such pattern speeds.

no clear evidence for helium in the spectrum of SN 1939B, as might be expected
from a helium-shell detonation on a white dwarf, suggested to be the origin of

suggested that an inhomogeneous environment may be responsible for observed arm
length asymmetries of jets and the properties of extended emission line regions

interaction of a powerful extragalactic bipolar jet with a disc-shaped clumpy
interstellar medium of log-normal density distribution and analyze the
asymmetry. Furthermore, we compute the relation between jet asymmetry and the
ISM properties by means of Monte Carlo simulations based on a 1D propagation
model for the jet through the dense medium. We find that the properties of the
ISM can be related to a probability distribution of jet arm length asymmetries:
Disc density and height are found to have the largest effect on the asymmetry
for realistic parameter ranges, while the Fourier energy spectrum of the ISM
and turbulent Mach number only have a smaller effect. The hydrodynamic
simulations show that asymmetries generally may be even larger than expected
from the 1D model due to the complex interaction of the jet and its bow shock
with gaseous clumps, which goes much beyond simple energy disposal. From our
results, observed asymmetries of medium-sized local radio galaxies may be
explained by gas masses of 10^9 to 10^10 solar masses in massive elliptical
galaxies. Furthermore, the simulations provide a theoretical basis for the
observed correlation that emission line nebulae are generally found to be
brighter on the side of the shorter lobe in high redshift radio galaxies

suggests that star formation in evolving high redshift galaxies may be affected

Since this deduced profile has a scale radius that is higher than inferred from

analysis using results of simulations for the profile of the DM velocity
anisotropy. Results of both analyses indicate a significant difference between
the kinematics of galaxies and DM within $r \lesssim 0.3r_{\rm vir}$. This
finding is reflected also in the shape of the galaxy number density profile,
which flattens markedly with respect to the steadily rising DM profile at small

interpreted as kinematic broadening from absorbing gas in outflowing winds
originating from star-forming galaxies. Taking a phenomenological approach and
using a set of observational constraints available for star-forming galaxies,
we are able to account for the density distribution of strong MgII absorbers
over cosmic time. The association of intervening material with star-forming
disks naturally explains the metallicity and dust content of strong MgII
systems as well as their high HI column densities, and does not require the
advection of metals from compact star-forming regions into the galaxy halos to
account for the observations. We find that galaxies with a broad range of
luminosities can give rise to absorption of a given rest-equivalent width, and
discuss possible observational strategies to better quantify true
galaxy-absorber associations and further test our model. We show that the
redshift evolution in the density of absorbers closely tracks the star
formation history of the universe and that strong intervening systems can be
used to directly probe the physics of both bright and faint galaxies over a
broad redshift range. By identifying strong intervening systems with galaxy
disks and quantifying a version of the Kennicutt-Schmidt law that applies to
them, a new probe of the interstellar medium is found which provides
complementary information to that obtained through emission studies of
galaxies. Implications of our results for galaxy feedback and enrichment of the

(Sigma ~ R^v with -0.3<~ v <~ -0.05) have been associated by several recent
studies with the presence of a central intermediate mass black hole (IMBH).
Such shallow slopes are observed in several globular clusters thanks to the
high angular resolution of Hubble Space Telescope imaging. In this Letter we
evaluate whether shallow cusps are a unique signature of a central IMBH by
analyzing a sample of direct N-body simulations of star clusters with and
without a central IMBH. We ``observe'' the simulations as if they were HST
images. Shallow cusps are common in our simulation sample: star clusters
without an IMBH have v >~ -0.3 in the pre-core-collapse and core-collapse
phases. Post-core-collapse clusters without an IMBH transition to steeper
cusps, -0.7<~ v <~ -0.4, only if the primordial binary fraction is very small,
f_{bin}< 3 per cent, and if there are few stellar-mass black holes remaining.
Otherwise v values overlap the range usually ascribed to the presence of an
IMBH throughout the entire duration of the simulations. In addition, measuring
v is intrinsically prone to significant uncertainty, therefore typical
measurement errors may lead to v > -0.3 even when <v> <~ -0.4. Overall our
analysis shows that a shallow cusp is not an unequivocal signature of a central
IMBH and casts serious doubts on the usefulness of measuring v in the context

element tracking measures of solar meridional flow can be explained by the
effects of surface turbulent magnetic diffusion. Feature-tracking speeds are
lower than plasma speeds in low and mid-latitudes, because magnetic diffusion
opposes poleward plasma flow in low-latitudes whereas it adds to plasma flow at
high latitudes. Flux transport dynamo models must input plasma flow; the
model-outputs yield estimates of the surface magnetic feature tracking speed.
We demonstrate that the differences between plasma speed and magnetic pattern

radio-loudness from the FIRST and NVSS data, we separate objects with radio
activity due to an AGN from ongoing residual star formation. Of 513 SDSS
galaxies with strong A-star spectra, 12 objects have 21-cm flux density above 1
mJy. These galaxies do not show optical AGN emission lines. Considering that
the lifetime of radio emission is much shorter than the typical time-scale of
the spectroscopic features of post-starburst galaxies, we conclude that the
radio-emitting AGN activity in these objects was triggered after the end of the
recent starburst, and thus cannot be an important feedback process to explain
the post-starburst phase. The radio luminosities show a positive correlation
with total galaxy stellar mass, but not with the mass of recently formed stars.
Thus the mechanical power of AGN feedback derived from the radio luminosity is
related to old stellar populations dominating the stellar mass, which in turn
are related to the masses of central supermassive black holes.

a single family perhaps governed by similar emission mechanisms. Surprisingly,
most blobs (16/25) are in one survey field, the CDFS. The six brightest,
largest blobs with L > 1.5x10^43 erg/s and Aiso > 16 arcsec^2 lie only in the
CDFS. These large, bright blobs have a field-to-field variance of sigma_v >~
1.5 (150%) about their number density n ~ 1.0x10^-5 Mpc^-3. This variance is
large, significantly higher than that of unresolved LAEs (sigma_v ~ 0.3 or
30%), and can adversely affect comparisons of blob number densities and
luminosity functions among different surveys. We compare the statistics of our
blobs with dark matter halos in a 1 Gpc/h cosmological N-body simulation. At

a halo of M_halo > 10^13 Msun if most halos have detectable blobs. The
predicted variance in n is consistent with that observed and corresponds to a

z=2.3 and are likely to evolve into the ~10^14 Msun halos typical of galaxy

atoms [E. Gosta, Nobel Lectures in Physics (2001-2005), World Scientific

illuminate a superfluid state of Wannier-Mott excitons. Excitons in quantum
wells, generated by a laser pulse, typically diffuse only a few micrometers
from the spot they are created. However, Butov et al. and Snoke et al. reported
luminescence from indirect and direct excitons hundreds of micrometers away
from the laser excitation spot in double and single quantum well (QW)
structures at low temperatures. This luminescence appears as a ring around the
laser spot with the dark region between the spot and the ring. Developing the
theory of a free superflow of Bose-liquids we show that the macroscopic
luminesce rings and the dark state are signatures of the coherent superflow of
condensed excitons at temperatures below their Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless
(BKT) transition temperature. To further verify the dark excitonic superflow we
propose several keystone experiments, including interference of superflows from
two laser spots, vortex formation, scanning of moving dipole moments, and a
giant increase of the luminescence distance by applying one-dimensional
confinement potential. These experiments combined with our theory will open a
new avenue for creating and controlling superflow of coherent excitons on
nanoscale.

is inclined by 60 degrees from pole-on. At 70 microns it appears partially
resolved and is elongated in the same direction and with nearly the same size
as seen with HST in scattered light. At 0.6 microns the ring shows no

line strength ratios and line widths favor an ionization scenario in which both
ion-electron collisions and UV photons contribute to the ionization in the gas.
Such a model requires a low-metallicity of -1.7 dex, ionization parameter of
log U ~ -1.4, a large total hydrogen column density of N(H) ~ 4 x 10^19 cm^-2,

wireless sensors. While this problem applies to many emerging applications, to
keep our discussion concrete we will focus on sensor networks used for
structural health monitoring. Within this context, the heaviest computation is
to determine the singular value decomposition (SVD) to extract mode shapes
(eigenvectors) of a structure. Compared to collecting raw vibration data and
performing SVD at a central location, computing SVD within the network can
result in significantly lower energy consumption and delay. Using recent
results on decomposing SVD, a well-known centralized operation, into
components, we seek to determine a near-optimal communication structure that
enables the distribution of this computation and the reassembly of the final
results, with the objective of minimizing energy consumption subject to a
computational delay constraint. We show that this reduces to a generalized
clustering problem; a cluster forms a unit on which a component of the overall
computation is performed. We establish that this problem is NP-hard. By
relaxing the delay constraint, we derive a lower bound to this problem. We then
propose an integer linear program (ILP) to solve the constrained problem
exactly as well as an approximate algorithm with a proven approximation ratio.
We further present a distributed version of the approximate algorithm. We
present both simulation and experimentation results to demonstrate the
effectiveness of these algorithms.

profile at very short timescales. This reveals a coupling between the periodic
and the low frequency aperiodic variabilities. In addition, near the end of the
outburst we have detected a strong QPO feature centered at ~ 0.135 Hz. The QPO
feature is broad with a quality factor of 3.3 and with an rms value of
18.5+/-3.1%. Using the QPO frequency and the X-ray luminosity during the QPO
detection period we estimated the magnetic field strength of the neutron star
as 0.31*10^12 G which is consistent with the value inferred earlier under the
assumption of spin equilibrium.

extend the theoretical study developed earlier for the case of normal incidence
[A. A. Asatryan et al, Phys. Rev. B 81, 075124 (2010)] to the case of off-axis
incidence. For the general case where both the refractive indices and layer
thicknesses are random, we obtain the long-wave and short-wave asymptotics of
the localization length over a wide range of incidence angles (including the
Brewster ``anomaly'' angle). At the Brewster angle, we show that the long-wave
localization length is proportional to the square of the wavelength, as for the
case of normal incidence, but with a proportionality coefficient substantially
larger than that for normal incidence. In mixed stacks with only
refractive-index disorder, we demonstrate that p-polarized waves are strongly
localized, while for s-polarization the localization is substantially
suppressed, as in the case of normal incidence. In the case of only thickness
disorder, we study also the transition from localization to delocalization at
the Brewster angle.

MDF. The MDF of NGC 4594 is similar to that of the elliptical galaxy of similar

galaxy clusters. The sample contains 121 relaxed Abell clusters and over 51,000
individual galaxies, which guarantees a thorough statistical coverage over a
wide range of physical parameters. We find that the median $\lambda_{d}$ value
tends to decrease as we approach the cluster center, with different dependences
according to the mass of the galaxies and the hosting cluster; low and
intermediate mass galaxies showing a strong dependence, while massive galaxies
seems to show, at all radii, low $\lambda_{d}$ values. By analysing trends in
$\lambda_{d}$ as functions of the nearest neighbour environment, clustercentric
radius and velocity dispersion of clusters, we can identify clearly the leading
physical processes at work. We find that in massive clusters ($\sigma>700$

constant. We consider the ""hot"" equation of state $P=(\Gamma-1)\rho e$ and its
""cold"" (fixed entropy, barotropic) form $P=K_0\rho^\Gamma$ (the latter does not
allow for shock heating). We find numerically that the evolution of generic
initial data approaches universal similarity solutions sufficiently near the
surface, and we construct these similarity solutions explicitly. The two
equations of state show very different behaviour, because shock heating becomes
the dominant effect when it is allowed. In the barotropic case, the fluid
velocity behind the shock approaches a constant value, while the density behind
the shock approaches a power law in space, as the shock approaches the surface.
In the hot case with shock heating,the density jumps by a constant factor
through the shock, while the sound speed and fluid velocity behind the shock
diverge in a whiplash effect. We tabulate the similarity exponents as a
function of the equation of state parameter $\Gamma$and the stratification
index $n_*$.

number of neurons that are strongly affected by noise. However, signals often
arise at macroscopic scales integrating the effect of many neurons into a
reliable pattern of activity. In order to study such large neuronal assemblies,
one is often led to derive mean-field limits summarizing the effect of the
interaction of a large number of neurons into an effective signal. Classical
mean-field approaches consider the evolution of a deterministic variable, the
mean activity, thus neglecting the stochastic nature of neural behavior. In
this article, we build upon two recent approaches that include correlations and
higher order moments in mean-field equations, and study how these stochastic
effects influence the solutions of the mean-field equations, both in the limit
of an infinite number of neurons and for large yet finite networks. We
introduce a new model, the infinite model, which arises from both equations by
a rescaling of the variables and, which is invertible for finite-size networks,
and hence, provides equivalent equations to those previously derived models.
The study of this model allows us to understand qualitative behavior of such
large-scale networks. We show that, though the solutions of the deterministic
mean-field equation constitute uncorrelated solutions of the new mean-field
equations, the stability properties of limit cycles are modified by the
presence of correlations, and additional non-trivial behaviors including
periodic orbits appear when there were none in the mean field. The origin of
all these behaviors is then explored in finite-size networks where interesting
mesoscopic scale effects appear. This study leads us to show that the
infinite-size system appears as a singular limit of the network equations, and
for any finite network, the system will differ from the infinite system.

rich coeval population of Wolf-Rayet stars, hot- and cool-phase transitional
supergiants, and a magnetar. We use spectroscopic and photometric observations
of the eclipsing double-lined binary W13 to derive dynamical masses for the two
components, in order to determine limits for the progenitor masses of the
magnetar CXOU J164710.2-455216 and the population of evolved stars in Wd1. W13
has an orbital period of 9.2709+/-0.0015 days and near-contact configuration.
The shallow photometric eclipse rules out an inclination greater than 65
degrees, leading to lower limits for the masses of the emission-line optical
primary and supergiant optical secondary of 21.4+/-2.6Msun and 32.8+/-4.0Msun
respectively, rising to 23.2 +3.3/-3.0Msun and 35.4 +5.0/-4.6 Msun for our
best-fit inclination 62 +3/-4 degrees. Comparison with theoretical models of
Wolf-Rayet binary evolution suggest the emission-line object had an initial
mass in excess of 35Msun, with the most likely model featuring highly
non-conservative late-Case-A/Case-B mass transfer and an initial mass in excess
of 40Msun. This confirms the high magnetar progenitor mass inferred from its
membership in Wd1, and represents the first dynamical constraint on the
progenitor mass of any magnetar. The red supergiants in Wd1 must have similar
progenitor masses to W13 and are therefore amongst the most massive stars to
undergo a red supergiant phase, representing a challenge for population models
that suggest stars in this mass range end their redwards evolution as yellow
hypergiants. [ABRIDGED]

of the nuclear activity on the circumnuclear ISM. PKS1345+12 is a powerful
quasar and is also the best studied case of an emission line outflow in a
ULIRG. Using the density sensitive transauroral emission lines [S II]4068,4076
and [O II]7318,7319,7330,7331, we pilot a new technique to accurately model the
electron density for cases in which it is not possible to use the traditional
diagnostic [S II]6716/6731, namely sources with highly broadened complex
emission line profiles and/or high (Ne > 10^4 cm^-3) electron densities. We
measure electron densities of Ne=2.94x10^3 cm^-3, Ne=1.47x10^4 cm^-3 and
Ne=3.16x10^5 cm^-3 for the regions emitting the narrow, broad and very broad
components respectively. We calculate a total mass outflow rate of 8 M_sun
yr^-1. We estimate the total mass in the warm gas outflow is 8x10^5 M_sun. The
total kinetic power in the warm outflow is 3.4x10^42 erg s^-1. We find that
only a small fraction (0.13% of Lbol) of the available accretion power is
driving the warm outflow, significantly less than currently required by the
majority of quasar feedback models (~5-10\% of Lbol), but similar to recent
findings by Hopkins et al. (2010) for a two-stage feedback model. The models
also predict that AGN outflows will eventually remove the gas from the bulge of
the host galaxy. The visible warm outflow in PKS1345+12 is not currently
capable of doing so. However, it is entirely possible that much of the outflow
is either obscured by a dense and dusty natal cocoon and/or in cooler or hotter
phases of the ISM. This result is important not just for studies of young
(GPS/CSS) radio sources, but for AGN in general.

plasmas. A typical situation is that a static plasma equilibrium is surrounded
by a plasma flow, which can lead to strong plasma flow gradients at the
separatrices between field lines with different magnetic topologies, e.g.,
planetary magnetospheres, helmet streamers in the solar corona, or at the
boundary between the heliosphere and interstellar medium. Within this work we
make a first step to understand the influence of these flows towards the
occurrence of current sheets in a stationary state situation. We concentrate
here on incompressible plasma flows and 2D equilibria, which allow us to find
analytic solutions of the stationary magnetohydrodynamics equations (SMHD).
First we solve the magnetohydrostatic (MHS) equations with the help of a
Grad-Shafranov equation and then we transform these static equilibria into a
stationary state with plasma flow. We are in particular interested to study
SMHD-equilibria with strong plasma flow gradients perpendicular to
separatrices. We find that induced thin current sheets occur naturally in such
situations. The strength of the induced currents depend on the Alfv\'en Mach
number and its gradient, and on the magnetic field.

However, for modelling complex systems, it is often useful to make use of
entropies such as the R\'{e}nyi and Tsallis entropies. We consider, here,
Shannon, R\'{e}nyi, Tsallis, Abe and structural entropies, for our analysis. We

that statistical pair correlation functions, determined by the components of

associated with the various entropies have well defined, definite expressions,
which may be extended for arbitrary finite particle systems. In all cases, we
find a non-degenerate intrinsic Riemannian manifold. In particular, any finite
particle system described in terms of R\'{e}nyi, Tsallis, Abe and structural
entropies, always corresponds to an interacting statistical system, thereby
highlighting their importance in the study of complex systems. On the other

protocols have tried to reduce inter-node interference at the cost of increased
latency and lower network capacity. In this paper we propose IAMAC, a CSMA/CA
sleep/wake MAC protocol that minimizes inter-node interference, while also
reduces per-hop delay through cross-layer interactions with the network layer.
Furthermore, we show that IAMAC can be integrated into the SP architecture to
perform its inter-layer interactions. Through simulation, we have extensively
evaluated the performance of IAMAC in terms of different performance metrics.
Simulation results confirm that IAMAC reduces energy consumption per node and
leads to higher network lifetime compared to S-MAC and Adaptive S-MAC, while it
also provides lower latency than S-MAC. Throughout our evaluations we have
considered IAMAC in conjunction with two error recovery methods, i.e., ARQ and
Seda. It is shown that using Seda as the error recovery mechanism of IAMAC
results in higher throughput and lifetime compared to ARQ.

precoding strategies at the relay. Then, we consider minimizing the total power
at the relay subject to individual SINR constraints using the same strategies
at the relay. We show that the downlink-uplink duality does not hold for the
setup considered here, which is a somewhat surprising result. We also show that
the beamforming strategy which is optimal in the single-pair case performs very
well in the multi-pair case for practically relevant SNR. The results are
illustrated by numerical simulations.

case of a non-standard model of cosmology with the addition of a dark component
in the pre-BBN era. In the context of the standard model of cosmology,
gravitino LSP has drawn quite some attention as it is a good candidate for dark
matter. It is produced in scattering processes during reheating after inflation
and from the decay of the stau. With a long lifetime, the stau decays during
Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. It is strongly constrained by the abundance of light
elements but can however address the known ""BBN lithium problem"". It requires
fairly massive staus $\mstau \gtrsim 1 \unit{TeV}$ and puts an upper bound on
the reheating temperature $T_R \simeq 10^7\unit{GeV}$ which does not satisfy
the requirements for thermal leptogenesis. For the non-standard cosmological
scenario, the reheating temperature bound can be strongly relaxed $T_R\gg 10^9
\unit{GeV}$ and the lithium-7 problem solved with a stau typical mass of
$\mstau \sim 600-700 \unit{GeV}$ and down to $\sim 400 \unit{GeV}$ with a very
important dark component that could enable possible production and detection at
the LHC.

2016-2019 at a total capital cost of 350M\texteuro, including an element for
contingency. The cost estimates of the SKA_1 telescope are now the subject of a
more detailed and thorough costing exercise led by the SKA Project Development

additional contingency is to reduce the overall scope of the project. The

refined, in particular the infrastructure costs at the two sites. The SKA_1

tail of dust particles at thermal equilibrium and is used as a cold mass tracer
in various environments including nearby galaxies. However, well-sampled
spectral energy distributions of the nearby, star-forming Magellanic Clouds
have a pronounced (sub-)millimeter excess (Israel et al., 2010). This study
attempts to confirm the existence of such a millimeter excess above expected
dust, free-free and synchrotron emission and to explore different possibilities
for its origin. We model NIR to radio spectral energy distributions of the
Magellanic Clouds with dust, free-free and synchrotron emission. A millimeter
excess emission is confirmed above these components and its spectral shape and
intensity are analysed in light of different scenarios: very cold dust, Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB) fluctuations, a change of the dust spectral index
and spinning dust emission. We show that very cold dust or CMB fluctuations are
very unlikely explanations for the observed excess in these two galaxies. The
excess in the LMC can be satisfactorily explained either by a change of the
spectral index due to intrinsic properties of amorphous grains, or by spinning
dust emission. In the SMC however, due to the importance of the excess, the
dust grain model including TLS/DCD effects cannot reproduce the observed
emission in a simple way. A possible solution was achieved with spinning dust
emission, but many assumptions on the physical state of the interstellar medium
had to be made. Further studies, using higher resolution data from Planck and
Herschel, are needed to probe the origin of this observed submm-cm excess more
definitely. Our study shows that the different possible origins will be best
distinguished where the excess is the highest, as is the case in the SMC.

well the second magnetization peak position, $H_p(T)$, are time dependent and
controlled by plastic motion of the vortex state. In the region delimited by a
characteristic field Hon (well below $H_p$), and $H_p$, the vortex dynamics is
controlled by collective pinning. For fields below Hon the activation energy,
$U_0$, increases with field as expected for collective pinning, but the pinning
mechanism is likely to be in the single vortex limit.

The inclusion of the nucleon loop considerably changes the $\rho$-meson

is seen that the spectral function shifts towards the low invariant mass
region, whereas in the MFA the spectral function is seen to be slightly shifted

of motion, beside added mass and steady Stokes drag, keeps into account the
unsteady Stokes drag force - known as Basset-Boussinesq history force - and the
non-Stokesian drag based on Schiller-Naumann parametrization, together with the
finite-size Faxen corrections. We focus on the case of flow at low
Taylor-Reynolds number, Re_lambda ~ 31, for which fully resolved numerical data
which can be taken as a reference are available (Homann & Bec 651 81-91 J.

minor effects on the acceleration statistics, their role is important on the
velocity behavior. We propose also that the scaling relations for the particle
velocity variance as a function of its size, which have been first detected in
fully resolved simulations, does not originate from inertial-scale properties
of the background turbulent flow but it is likely to arise from the
non-Stokesian component of the drag produced by the wake behind the particle.
Furthermore, by means of comparison with fully resolved simulations, we show
that the Faxen correction to the added mass has a dominant role in the particle
acceleration statistics even for particle with size in the inertial range.

already been presented [Minier and Peirano, Physics Reports, Vol. 352/1-3, 2001

that are often overlooked and that require particular attention. In particular,
the following points are analysed : the necessity to add an extra term in the
equation for the velocity of the fluid seen in the case of twoway coupling, the
theoretical and numerical evaluations of particle averages and the fulfilment
of the particle mass-continuity constraint. The theoretical model is developed
within the PDF formalism. The important-physical choice of the state vector
variables is first discussed and the model is then expressed as a stochastic
differential equation (SDE) written in continuous time (Langevin equations) for
the velocity of the fluid seen. The interests and limitations of Langevin
equations, compared to the single-phase case, are reviewed. From the numerical
point of view, the model corresponds to an hybrid Eulerian/Lagrangian approach
where the fluid and particle phases are simulated by different methods.
Important aspects of the Monte Carlo particle/mesh numerical method are
emphasised. Finally, the complete model is validated and its performance is
assessed by simulating a bluff-body case with an important recirculation zone
and in which two-way coupling is noticeable.

plasma using Helios data. From our statistical analysis we found that the wave
power of high-frequency transverse waves (having frequencies between 0.01 and 1
normalized to the proton gyrofrequency in the plasma frame) correlates with
both, the proton temperature anisotropy, $T_{\perp}/T_{\parallel}$, and the
normalized differential speed, $V_{\alpha p}/V_A$, between alpha particles and
protons. Furthermore, when this speed stays below 0.5, then the alpha-particle
temperature anisotropy correlate positively with the relative power of the
transverse waves. However, if $V_{\alpha p}/V_A$ is larger than 0.6, then the
alpha-particle temperature anisotropy tends to decrease towards values below
unity, despite the presence of transverse waves with relatively large
amplitudes. For small relative wave amplitude, it is found that alpha particles
can even be heated more strongly than protons when the alpha-to-electron
density ratio nearly or below 0.01. Our findings are in good agreement with
predictions of kinetic theory for the resonant interaction of ions with
Alfv\'en-cyclotron waves and for the resulting wave dissipation. Also, the
study suggests that the turbulence could lead to the generation of parallel

overdamped limit, the evolution of the spatial density is governed by the
generalized mean field Smoluchowski equation including a mean field potential
due to long-range interactions and a generically nonlinear barotropic pressure
due to short-range interactions. This equation describes various physical
systems such as self-gravitating Brownian particles (Smoluchowski-Poisson
system), bacterial populations experiencing chemotaxis (Keller-Segel model) and
colloidal particles with capillary interactions. We also take into account the
inertia of the particles and derive corresponding kinetic and hydrodynamic
equations generalizing the usual Kramers, Jeans, Euler and Cattaneo equations.
For each model, we provide the corresponding form of free energy and establish
the H-theorem and the virial theorem. Finally, we show that the same
hydrodynamic equations are obtained in the context of nonlinear mean field
Fokker-Planck equations associated with generalized thermodynamics. However, in
that case, the nonlinear pressure is due to the bias in the transition
probabilities from one state to the other leading to non-Boltzmannian
distributions while in the former case the distribution is Boltzmannian but the
nonlinear pressure arises from the two-body correlation function induced by the
short-range potential of interaction. As a whole, our paper develops
connections between the topics of long-range interactions, short-range
interactions, nonlinear mean field Fokker-Planck equations and generalized
thermodynamics. It also justifies from a kinetic theory based on microscopic
processes, the basic equations that were introduced phenomenologically in
gravitational Brownian dynamics, chemotaxis and colloidal suspensions with

size disperse spheres, produced in a granular experiment as well as
numerically. While the structure factor of the packings reveals no unusual
behavior for small wavevectors, the compressibility displays an anomalous
linear dependence at low wavectors and vanishes when q -> 0. We show that such
behavior occurs because jammed packings of size disperse spheres have no bulk
fluctuations of the volume fraction and are thus hyperuniform, a property not
observed experimentally before. Our results apply to arbitrary particle size
distributions. For continuous distributions, we derive a perturbative
expression for the compressibility that is accurate for polydispersity up to
about 30%.

of the most powerful algebraic tools in combinatorics, with a diverse array of

deduces a simple and amazingly widely applicable nonvanishing criterion
(Theorem 1.2 in \cite{Alon1}). It provides a sufficient condition for a
polynomial $f(x_1,...,x_n)$ which guarantees that $f$ is not identically zero
on the set $S$. In this paper we extend these two results from sets of points

detection is becoming essential in the study of the formation of structure, the
production of merger trees and the seeding of semi-analytic models. To
investigate the state of halo finders, we compare two different approaches to
detecting subhaloes; the first based on overdensities in a halo and the second
being adaptive mesh refinement. A set of stable mock NFW dark matter haloes
were produced and a subhalo was placed at different radii within a larger halo.
SUBFIND (a Friends-of-Friends based finder) and AHF (an adaptive mesh based
finder) were employed to recover the subhalo. As expected, we found that the
mass of the subhalo recovered by SUBFIND has a strong dependence on the radial
position and that neither halo finder can accurately recover the subhalo when
it is very near the centre of the halo. This radial dependence is shown to be
related to the subhalo being truncated by the background density of the halo
and originates due to the subhalo being defined as an overdensity. If the
subhalo size is instead determined using the peak of the circular velocity
profile, a much more stable value is recovered. The downside to this is that
the maximum circular velocity is a poor measure of stripping and is affected by
resolution. For future halo finders to recover all the particles in a subhalo,
a search of phase space will need to be introduced.

Bohr and Kant is painted in broad strokes; it is open to the criticism that
these affinities are merely superficial. In this essay, I provide a closer,

connections more explicit. In particular, I demonstrate the similarities
between Bohr's argument, on the one hand, that neither the wave nor the
particle description of atomic phenomena pick out an object in the ordinary
sense of the word, and Kant's requirement, on the other hand, that both
'mathematical' (having to do with magnitude) and 'dynamical' (having to do with
an object's interaction with other objects) principles must be applicable to
appearances in order for us to determine them as objects of experience. I argue
that Bohr's 'Complementarity interpretation' of quantum mechanics, which views
atomic objects as idealizations, and which licenses the repeal of the principle
of causality for the domain of atomic physics, is perfectly compatible with,
and indeed follows naturally from a broadly Kantian epistemological framework.

difficulty of detecting cool, late-type, main sequence companions in binary
systems with hot pre-white dwarf primaries. However, models of binary PN
progenitor systems predict that mass accretion or tidal interactions can induce
rapid rotation in the companion, leading to X-ray-emitting coronae. To test
such models, we have searched for, and detected, X-ray emission from three
binary central stars within planetary nebulae: the post-common envelope close
binaries in HFG 1 and DS 1 consisting of O-type subdwarfs with late-type, main
sequence companions, and the binary system in LoTr 5 consisting of O-type
subdwarf and rapidly rotating, late-type giant companion. The X-ray emission in
each case is best characterized by spectral models consisting of two
optically-thin thermal plasma components with characteristic temperatures of
about 10 MK and 15-40 MK, and total X-ray luminosities about 10^30 erg/s. We
consider the possible origin of the X-ray emission from these binary systems
and conclude that the most likely origin is, in each case, a corona around the
late-type companion, as predicted by models of interacting binaries.

Our analysis uses the intensities from four ions, C IV, O VI, O VII, and O

O VII and O VIII intensities from FUSE and XMM-Newton data and subtracted off
the local contributions in order to deduce the thick disk/halo contributions.
These were supplemented with published C IV intensity and O VI column density
measurements. Our estimate of the thermal pressure in the O VI-rich thick
disk/halo gas, p_{th}/k = 6500^{+2500}_{-2600} K cm^{-3}, suggests that the
thick disk/halo is more highly pressurized than would be expected from
theoretical analyses. The ratios of C IV to O VI to O VII to O VIII,
intensities were compared with those predicted by theoretical models. Gas which
was heated to 3,000,000 K then allowed to cool radiatively cannot produce
enough C IV or O VI-generated photons per O VII or O VIII-generated photon.
Producing enough C IV and O VI emission requires heating additional gas to
100,000 < T < 1,000,000 K. However, shock heating, which provides heating
across this temperature range, overproduces O VI relative to the others.
Obtaining the observed mix may require a combination of several processes,
including some amount of shock heating, heat conduction, and mixing, as well as
radiative cooling of very hot gas.

this work, we introduce a periodic spatial modulation of the linear coupling,
making $\Omega $ an odd, or even function of the coordinate. The sign flips of
$\Omega (x)$ strongly modify the structure of the GS in the binary system, as
the relative sign of its components tends to lock to the local sign of $\Omega

demonstrate that the GS of the trapped system contains one or several kinks

kinks in the GS as a function of the system's parameters, with the odd/even

operator acting in a Hilbert space of a quantum system with SU(n) symmetry
group and its symbol in the corresponding classical phase space. For symmetric
irreps of SU(n), this mapping is bijective. We briefly discuss complications
that will occur in the general case.

observations of the disturbed cool core cluster Abell 133. The diffuse gas has
a complex bird-like morphology, with a plume of emission extending from two
symmetric wing-like features, and capped with a filamentary radio relic. X-ray
observations indicate the presence of either high temperature gas or
non-thermal emission in the region of the relic. We find evidence for a weak
elliptical X-ray surface brightness edge surrounding the core, consistent with
a sloshing cold front. The plume is consistent with having formed due to uplift
by a buoyantly rising radio bubble, now seen as the radio relic. Our results
are inconsistent with the previous suggestion that the X-ray wings formed due
to the passage of a weak shock through the cool core. We instead conclude that
the wings are due to X-ray cavities formed by gas displacement by the radio
relic. The central cD galaxy contains two small-scale cold gas clumps that are
slightly offset from their optical and UV counterparts, suggestive of a
galaxy-galaxy merger event. On larger scales, there is evidence for cluster
substructure in both optical observations and the X-ray temperature map. We
suggest that Abell 133 has recently undergone a merger event with an
interloping subgroup, initiating gas sloshing in the core. We show that the
additional buoyant force from a passing subcluster can have a significant
effect on the rise trajectories of buoyant bubbles, although this effect alone
cannot fully explain the morphology of Abell 133. The radio observations reveal
a previously unreported background giant radio galaxy at z = 0.293, the
northern lobe of which overlies the radio relic in the core of Abell 133. A
rough estimate indicates that the contribution of this background lobe to the
total radio emission in the region of the relic is modest (< 13%). (Abridged)

equations admit of ""soliton-like"" solutions, known as Localized Waves or
Non-diffracting Waves, which propagate without distortion in one direction.
Such Localized Solutions (existing also for K-G and Dirac equations) are a
priori suitable, more than Gaussian's, for describing elementary particle
motion. In this paper we show that, mutatis mutandis, Localized Solutions exist
even for the ordinary Schroedinger equation, within standard Quantum Mechanics;
and we obtain both approximate and exact solutions, setting forth particular
examples for them. In the ideal case such solutions bear infinite energy, as
well as plane or spherical waves: we also demonstrate, therefore, how to obtain
finite-energy solutions. At last, we briefly consider solutions for a particle
moving in the presence of a potential. Some physical comments are added.

electrostatic solvation energy of the system, and equilibrium membrane
deformation is obtained by minimizing the electro-elastic energy functional
with respect to the dielectric interface. The model is illustrated with the
systems with increasing geometry complexity and captures the sensitivity of
membrane curvature to the permanent and mobile charge distributions.
