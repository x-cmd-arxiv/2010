all-to-all networks of non-identical oscillators with adaptive coupling. The
adaptation models spike-timing-dependent plasticity in which the sum of the
weights of all incoming links is conserved. We find multiple phase-locked
states that fall into two classes: near-synchronized states and splay states.
Among the near-synchronized states are states that oscillate with a frequency
that depends only very weakly on the coupling strength and is essentially given
by the frequency of one of the oscillators, which is, however, neither the
fastest nor the slowest oscillator. In sufficiently large networks the adaptive
coupling is found to develop effective network topologies dominated by one or
two loops. This results in a multitude of stable splay states, which differ in
their firing sequences. With increasing coupling strength their frequency
increases linearly and the oscillators become less synchronized. The essential
features of the two classes of states are captured analytically in perturbation
analyses of the extended Kuramoto model used in the simulations.

macroscopic dynamics of the ecosystem that lead to different stable attractors
among which the shift takes place. Here we propose an alternative explanation
of catastrophic regime shifts based on a recent model that pictures ecological
communities as systems in continuous fluctuation, according to certain
transition probabilities, between different micro-states in the phase space of
viable communities. We introduce a spontaneous extinction rate that accounts
for gradual changes in external conditions, and upon variations on this control
parameter the system undergoes a regime shift with similar features to those
previously reported. Under our microscopic viewpoint we recover the main
results obtained in previous theoretical and empirical work (anomalous
variance, hysteresis cycles, trophic cascades). The model predicts a gradual
loss of species in trophic levels from bottom to top near the transition. But
more importantly, the spectral analysis of the transition probability matrix
allows us to rigorously establish that we are observing the fingerprints, in a
finite size system, of a true phase transition driven by background
extinctions.

single-electron tunneling while accounting for the strong interactions in such
systems. In this paper we report a detailed comparison between three prominent
approaches to quantum transport: the fourth-order Bloch-Redfield quantum master
equation (BR), the real-time diagrammatic technique (RT), and the scattering
rate approach based on the T-matrix (TM). Central to the BR and RT is the
generalized master equation for the reduced density matrix. We demonstrate the
exact equivalence of these two techniques. By accounting for coherences
(nondiagonal elements of the density matrix) between nonsecular states, we show
how contributions to the transport kernels can be grouped in a physically
meaningful way. This not only significantly reduces the numerical cost of
evaluating the kernels but also yields expressions similar to those obtained in
the TM approach, allowing for a detailed comparison. However, in the TM
approach an ad hoc regularization procedure is required to cure spurious
divergences in the expressions for the transition rates in the stationary
(zero-frequency) limit. We show that these problems derive from incomplete
cancellation of reducible contributions and do not occur in the BR and RT
techniques, resulting in well-behaved expressions in the latter two cases.
Additionally, we show that a standard regularization procedure of the TM rates
employed in the literature does not correctly reproduce the BR and RT
expressions. All the results apply to general quantum dot models and we present
explicit rules for the simplified calculation of the zero-frequency kernels.
Although we focus on fourth-order perturbation theory only, the results and
implications generalize to higher orders. We illustrate our findings for the
single impurity Anderson model with finite Coulomb interaction in a magnetic
field.

exotic DM candidates, with an- nihilation cross sections a few orders of

basic results are that the final stellar properties, once the star enters the

stellar mass ~ 1000M\odot, luminosity ~ 10^7 L\odot, lifetime ~ 10^6 yrs (for

convergence field as a function of angular position on the sky. The statistics
of this field, much like that of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), can be
studied to extract information about fundamental parameters in cosmology, most
notably the dark energy in the Universe. Unlike the CMB, the distribution of
matter in the Universe which determines the convergence field is highly
non-Gaussian, reflecting the nonlinear processes which accompanied structure
formation. Much of the cosmic information contained in the initial field is
therefore unavailable to the standard power spectrum measurements. Here we
propose a method for re-capturing cosmic information by using the power
spectrum of a simple function of the observed (nonlinear) convergence field. We
adapt the approach of Neyrinck et al. (2009) to lensing by using a modified

optical spectra from the McDonald Observatory and the Special Astrophysical

the line analysis program MOOG provides the atmospheric parameters: Teff = 6500
K, log g = +0.5, and a microturbulent velocity Vt = 4.7 km/s and [Fe/H] = -0.9.
Extraction of these parameters is based on excitation of FeI lines, ionization
equilibrium between neutral and ions of Mg, Ca, Ti, Cr, and Fe, and the wings
of hydrogen Paschen lines. Elemental abundances are obtained for 22 elements
and upper limits for an additional four elements. These results show that the
star's atmosphere has not experienced a significant number of C- and s-process
enriching thermal pulses. Abundance anomalies as judged relative to the
compositions of unevolved and less-evolved normal stars of a similar
metallicity include Al, Y, and Zr deficiencies with respect to Fe of about 0.5
dex. Judged by composition, the star resembles a RV Tauri variable that has
been mildly affected by dust-gas separation reducing the abundances of the
elements of highest condensation temperature. This separation may occur in the
stellar wind. There are indications that the standard 1D LTE analysis is not
entirely appropriate for IRAS 18095+2704. These include a supersonic
macroturbulent velocity of 23 km/s, emission in H-alpha and the failure of
predicted profiles to fit observed profiles of H-beta and H-gamma.

one-dimensional lattices based on tight-binding models with various forms of
hopping terms beyond the nearest neighbor, which are generalizations of the
famous Aubry-Andr\'e and noninteracting Anderson model. For the case with
deterministic disordered potential induced by a secondary incommensurate
lattice (i.e. the Aubry-Andr\'e model), we identify a class of self dual
models, for which the boundary between localized and extended eigenstates are
determined analytically by employing a generalized Aubry-Andr\'e
transformation. We also numerically investigate the localization properties of
non-dual models with next-nearest-neighbor hopping, Gaussian, and power-law
decay hopping terms. We find that even for these non-dual models, the
numerically obtained mobility edges can be well approximated by the
analytically obtained condition for localization transition in the self dual
models, as long as the decay of the hopping rate with respect to distance is
sufficiently fast. For the disordered potential with genuinely random
character, we examine scenarios with next-nearest-neighbor hopping,
exponential, Gaussian, and power-law decay hopping terms numerically. We find
that the higher order hopping terms can remove the symmetry in the localization
length about the energy band center compared to the Anderson model.
Furthermore, our results demonstrate that for the power-law decay case, there
exists a critical exponent below which mobility edges can be found. Our
theoretical results could, in principle, be directly tested in shallow atomic
optical lattice systems enabling non-nearest-neighbor hopping.

Outflows provide indirect means to get an insight on diverse star
formation associated phenomena. On scales of individual protostellar cores,
outflows combined with intrinsic core properties can be used to study the mass
accretion/ejection process of heavily embedded protostellar sources. Methods.
An area comprising 460""x230"" of the Serpens cloud core has been mapped in 12 CO
J = 3\to 2 with the HARP-B heterodyne array at the James Clerk Maxwell
Telescope; J = 3\to 2 observations are more sensitive tracers of hot outflow
gas than lower J CO transitions; combined with the high sensitivity of the
HARP-B receptors outflows are sharply outlined, enabling their association with
individual protostellar cores. Results. Most of ~20 observed outflows are found
to be associated with known protostellar sources in bipolar or unipolar
configurations. All but two outflow/core pairs in our sample tend to have a
projected orientation spanning roughly NW-SE. The overall momentum driven by
outflows in Serpens lies between 3.2 and 5.1 x 10^(-1) M\odot km s^(-1), the
kinetic energy from 4.3 to 6.7 x 10^(43) erg and momentum flux is between 2.8
and 4.4 x 10^(-4) M\odot km s^(-1) yr^(-1). Bolometric luminosities of
protostellar cores based on Spitzer photometry are found up to an order of
magnitude lower than previous estimations derived with IRAS/ISO data.
Conclusions. We confirm the validity of the existing correlations between the
momentum flux and bolometric luminosity of Class I sources for the homogenous
sample of Serpens, though we suggest that they should be revised by a shift to
lower luminosities. All protostars classified as Class 0 sources stand well
above the known Class I correlations, indicating a decline in momentum flux
between the two classes.

systems with and without statistical disorder correlations. We shall focus on
the specific case of two generally dissimilar plane-parallel slabs, which
interact across vacuum or an arbitrary intervening dielectric medium. Monopolar
charge disorder is considered to be present on the bounding surfaces and/or in
the bulk of the slabs, may be in general quenched or annealed and may possess a
finite lateral correlation length reflecting possible `patchiness' of the
random charge distribution. In the case of quenched disorder, the bulk disorder
is shown to give rise to an additive long-range contribution to the total
force, which decays as the inverse distance between the slabs and may be
attractive or repulsive depending on the dielectric constants of the slabs. We
show that in the case of two dissimilar slabs the net effect due to the
interplay between the disorder-induced and the pure van der Waals interactions
can lead to a variety of unusual non-monotonic interaction profiles between the
dielectric slabs. In particular, when the intervening medium has a larger
dielectric constant than the two slabs, we find that the net interaction can
become repulsive and exhibit a potential barrier, while the underlying van der
Waals force is attractive. On the contrary, when the intervening medium has a
dielectric constant in between that of the two slabs, the net interaction can
become attractive and exhibit a free energy minimum, while the pure van der
Waals force is repulsive. Therefore, the charge disorder, if present, can
drastically alter the effective interaction between net-neutral objects.

shock solutions for one-dimensional Euler-Poission system are investigated.
First, a steady transonic shock solution with supersonic backgroumd charge is
shown to be structurally stable with respect to small perturbations of the
background charge, provided that the electric field is positive at the shock
location. Second, any steady transonic shock solution with the supersonic
background charge is proved to be dynamically and exponentially stable with
respect to small perturbation of the initial data, provided the electric field
is not too negative at the shock location. The proof of the first stability
result relies on a monotonicity argument for the shock position and the
downstream density, and a stability analysis for subsonic and supersonic
solutions. The dynamical stability of the steady transonic shock for the
Euler-Poisson equations can be transformed to the global well-posedness of a
free boundary problem for a quasilinear second order equation with nonlinear
boundary conditions. The analysis for the associated linearized problem plays
an essential role.

the Standard Model(SM) naturally involve some form of $D=4+n$-dimensional
Lorentz invariance violation (LIV). In such models the fundamental physics
which leads to, e.g., field localization, orbifolding, the existence of brane
terms and the compactification process all can introduce LIV in the higher
dimensional theory while still preserving 4-d Lorentz invariance. In this
paper, attempting to capture some of this physics, we extend our previous
analysis of LIV in 5-d UED-type models to those with 5-d warped extra
dimensions. To be specific, we employ the 5-d analog of the SM Extension of
Kostelecky et. al. ~which incorporates a complete set of operators arising from
spontaneous LIV. We show that while the response of the bulk scalar, fermion
and gauge fields to the addition of LIV operators in warped models is
qualitatively similar to what happens in the flat 5-d UED case, the gravity
sector of these models reacts very differently than in flat space.
Specifically, we show that LIV in this warped case leads to a non-zero bulk
mass for the 5-d graviton and so the would-be zero mode, which we identify as
the usual 4-d graviton, must necessarily become massive. The origin of this
mass term is the simultaneous existence of the constant non-zero $AdS_5$
curvature and the loss of general co-ordinate invariance via LIV in the 5-d
theory. Thus warped 5-d models with LIV in the gravity sector are not
phenomenologically viable.

in general agreement with previous studies of line emission in cooling flow

the Halpha luminosity is also found for our complete sample, with a large
amount of scatter about the expected relation for photoionization by young
stars. We detect Halpha emission out to the X-ray cooling radius, but no
further, in several clusters and find a strong correlation between the Halpha
luminosity contained in filaments and the X-ray cooling flow rate of the
cluster, suggesting that the warm ionized gas is linked to the cooling flow.
Furthermore, we detect a strong enhancement in the cooling properties of the
ICM coincident with the Halpha emission, compared to the surrounding ICM at the
same radius. While the filaments in a few clusters may be entrained by buoyant
radio bubbles, in general, the radially-infalling cooling flow model provides a
better explanation for the observed trends. The correlation of the Halpha and
X-ray properties suggests that conduction may be important in keeping the
filaments ionized. The thinness of the filaments suggests that magnetic fields
are an important part of channeling the gas and shielding it from the

about a few 10^{50} erg are stored in the relativistic electrons; the rest is
in protons, nuclei and non-relativistic electrons. The X-ray-emitting component
of the gas in the hot spots contains ~10^{51} erg, and ~10^{52} erg over the

universally used technique that has matured significantly in the last decade.
Model predictions and fitting procedures have improved significantly over this
time, attempting to keep up with the vastly increased volume and quality of
available data. We review here the field of SED fitting, describing the
modelling of ultraviolet to infrared galaxy SEDs, the creation of
multiwavelength data sets, and the methods used to fit model SEDs to observed
galaxy data sets. We touch upon the achievements and challenges in the major
ingredients of SED fitting, with a special emphasis on describing the interplay
between the quality of the available data, the quality of the available models,
and the best fitting technique to use in order to obtain a realistic
measurement as well as realistic uncertainties. We conclude that SED fitting
can be used effectively to derive a range of physical properties of galaxies,
such as redshift, stellar masses, star formation rates, dust masses, and
metallicities, with care taken not to over-interpret the available data. Yet
there still exist many issues such as estimating the age of the oldest stars in
a galaxy, finer details ofdust properties and dust-star geometry, and the
influences of poorly understood, luminous stellar types and phases. The
challenge for the coming years will be to improve both the models and the
observational data sets to resolve these uncertainties. The present review will
be made available on an interactive, moderated web page (sedfitting.org), where
the community can access and change the text. The intention is to expand the

materials. The phenomenon is thought to be related to wear of diamond tools

has recently acquired importance. Many researchers studied emission during
scratching of solid surfaces. They observed that the intensity of tribo-induced
emission of the electrons, ions, and photons decrease in the order:
insulator>semiconductor> conductor. Many experiments conducted to compare the
emission of negatively-charged particles in case of the semiconductors Si with
that from selected insulators have reported a clear decreasing trend of the
tribo-emission intensity as contact progressed over the same wear track for
diamond-on-Si. Despite that all of these experiments were performed in vacuum,
the origin of the weak signals and the decrease of signal strength in the case
of Si centred on the presence of dielectric silicon oxide films formed in air
during surface preparation or because of the samples being of mono-crystalline
nature. This paper offers an alternative explanation to the behaviour of
tribo-emitted particles based on the pressure induced
semi-conductor-to-metallic phase transformation that takes place in Si during
sliding. It is shown that due to repeated sliding, the wear tracks experience a
semiconductor-to- metal transformation that renders the bulk of material
immediately under the diamond slider conducting.

remarkably good agreement in both the parallel and the perpendicular directions

stars formed in stellar clusters, because they tend to increase the effective
Jeans mass. We test this expectation using adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)
magnetohydrodynamic simulations of cluster formation in turbulent magnetized
clumps of molecular clouds, treating stars as accreting sink particles. We find
that, contrary to the common expectation, a magnetic field of strength in the
observed range decreases, rather than increases, the characteristic stellar
mass. It (1) reduces the number of intermediate-mass stars that are formed
through direct turbulent compression, because sub-regions of the clump with
masses comparable to those of stars are typically magnetically subcritical and
cannot be compressed directly into collapse, and (2) increases the number of
low-mass stars that are produced from the fragmentation of dense filaments. The
filaments result from mass accumulation along the field lines. In order to
become magnetically supercritical and fragment, the filament must accumulate a
large enough column density (proportional to the field strength), which yields
a high volume density (and thus a small thermal Jeans mass) that is conducive
to forming low-mass stars. We find, in addition, that the characteristic
stellar mass is reduced further by outflow feedback. The conclusion is that
both magnetic fields and outflow feedback are important in shaping the stellar
initial mass function (IMF).

in disk galaxies, in which ISM heating by stellar UV plays a key role. By
requiring simultaneous thermal and (vertical) dynamical equilibrium in the
diffuse gas, and star formation at a rate proportional to the mass of the
self-gravitating component, we obtain a prediction for Sigma_SFR as a function
of the total gaseous surface density Sigma and the density of stars + dark
matter, rho_sd. The physical basis of this relationship is that thermal
pressure in the diffuse ISM, which is proportional to the UV heating rate and
therefore to Sigma_SFR, must adjust to match the midplane pressure set by the
vertical gravitational field. Our model applies to regions where Sigma < 100
Msun/pc^2. In low-Sigma_SFR (outer-galaxy) regions where diffuse gas dominates,
the theory predicts Sigma_SFR \propto Sigma (rho_sd)^1/2. The decrease of
thermal equilibrium pressure when Sigma_SFR is low implies, consistent with
observations, that star formation can extend (with declining efficiency) to
large radii in galaxies, rather than having a sharp cutoff. The main parameters
entering our model are the ratio of thermal pressure to total pressure in the
diffuse ISM, the fraction of diffuse gas that is in the warm phase, and the
star formation timescale in self-gravitating clouds; all of these are (in
principle) direct observables. At low surface density, our model depends on the
ratio of the mean midplane FUV intensity (or thermal pressure in the diffuse
gas) to the star formation rate, which we set based on Solar neighborhood
values. We compare our results to recent observations, showing good agreement
overall for azimuthally-averaged data in a set of spiral galaxies. For the

heat engine in the Carnot sense. The model assumes that the MAZ is a heat
engine that transports heat from a high temperature reservoir, represented by
the asperity contact layer, to a low temperature reservoir, represented by the
sub-contact layer. Consequently an entropy generation source that represents
the irreversibilities within the MAZ is defined and a study of the entropy
generation is attempted. Wear data, published elsewhere, of two materials,
Oxygen Free High conductivity Copper, and Commercially Pure Titanium are
analyzed using the developed model. It is found that wear for both materials is
correlated to entropy generation, and to the entropy flow within the MAZ.
Interestingly, moreover, in view of the contrasting wear trends of the test
materials, the relationship of the mass wear rate and the specific wear rate of
each material with respect to entropy generation are totally opposite to each
other. A common feature between the behavior of the two materials, was found in
wear behavior with respect to a so called Ratio of Residual Entropy. This ratio
determines wether the system is over or under supplied with entropy. It is
found that when the capacity to transport entropy exceeds the entropy supply
the mass wear rate increases, and when the entropy transport capacity of the
system is exceeded and entropy generation takes place the mass wear rate
decreases. This is attributed to the re-establishment of equilibrium within the
system.

require to insert some slow-electrons or weak electron current into the space

fringes. Under the BI, the externally inserted electrons also can be influenced
by the Quantum Potential (QP) in a totally same way with the electrons which

under the SQM, the Schr\""{o}dinger-$\psi$ does not represent an objectively
real field, but only a mathematical construction of the probability
characteristics of the particle itself, so the externally inserted electrons
and the electrons which come from the slits have no correlations with each
other. No any priority positions at the detector plane the externally inserted
electrons will arrive. And the affections are only the addition of a uniform
bright background. In such a meaning, the dark zones of the fringes of the

corrects an arbitrary single-qubit error. The first example is a degenerate

this result is that the Steane seven-qubit code is the smallest single-error

six-qubit CSS entanglement-assisted code. This code uses one bit of
entanglement (an ebit) shared between the sender (Alice) and the receiver (Bob)
and corrects an arbitrary single-qubit error. In the second half of this thesis
we explore the yet uncharted and relatively undiscovered area of quantum
steganography. Steganography is the process of hiding secret information by
embedding it in an innocent message. We present protocols for hiding quantum
information in a codeword of a quantum error-correcting code passing through a
channel. Using either a shared classical secret key or shared entanglement
Alice disguises her information as errors in the channel. Bob can retrieve the
hidden information, but an eavesdropper (Eve) with the power to monitor the
channel, but without the secret key, cannot distinguish the message from
channel noise. We analyze how difficult it is for Eve to detect the presence of
secret messages, and estimate rates of steganographic communication and secret

on simple models for thermal leakage injection and Alfv'enic drift. The
critical injection rate, \xi_c, above which the cosmic ray (CR) pressure

M, and preshock gas temperature, T_1. In the hot-phase interstellar medium
(ISM) and intracluster medium, \xi_c < 10^{-3} for shocks with M < 5, while
\xi_c ~ 10^{-4}(T_1/10^6 K)^{1/2} for shocks with M > 10. For T_1=10^6 K, for
example, the test-particle solution would be valid if the injection momentum,
p_{inj} > 3.8 p_{th}. This leads to the postshock CR pressure less than 10% of
the shock ram pressure. If the Alfv'en speed is comparable to the sound speed
in the preshock flow, as in the hot-phase ISM, the power-law slope of CR
spectrum can be significantly softer than the canonical test-particle slope.
Then the CR spectrum at the shock can be approximated by the revised
test-particle power-law with an exponential cutoff at the highest accelerated
momentum, p_{max}(t). An analytic form of the exponential cutoff is also
suggested.

that mediate and change the signal through the pathway. Here, we study a simple
signaling cascade consisting of n layers of modification cycles, such that the
modified protein of one layer acts as modifier in the next layer. Assuming
mass-action kinetics and taking the formation of intermediate complexes into
account, we show that the steady states are solutions to a polynomial in one
variable, and in fact that there is exactly one steady state for any given
total amounts of substrates and enzymes.
  We demonstrate that many steady state concentrations are related through
rational functions, which can be found recursively. For example,
stimulus-response curves arise as inverse functions to explicit rational
functions. We show that the stimulus-response curves of the modified substrates
are shifted to the left as we move down the cascade. Further, our approach
allows us to study enzyme competition, sequestration and how the steady state
changes in response to changes in the total amount of substrates.

V2362 Cyg (= Nova Cygni 2006). V2362 Cyg experienced a peculiar rebrightening
with a long duration from 100 to 240 d after the maximum of the nova. Our
multicolor observation indicates an emergence of a pseudophotosphere with an
effective temperature of 9000 K at the rebrightening maximum. After the
rebrightening maximum, the object showed a slow fading homogeneously in all of
the used bands for one week. This implies that the fading just after the
rebrightening maximum ( less or equal 1 week ) was caused by a slowly shrinking
pseudophotosphere. Then, the NIR flux drastically increased, while the optical
flux steeply declined. The optical and NIR flux was consistent with blackbody
radiation with a temperature of 1500 K during this NIR rising phase. These
facts are likely to be explained by dust formation in the nova ejecta. Assuming
an optically thin case, we estimate the dust mass of 10^(-8) -- 10^(-10)
M_solar, which is less than those in typical dust-forming novae. These results
support the senario that a second, long-lasting outflow, which caused the
rebrightening, interacted with a fraction of the initial outflow and formed
dust grains.

Deutsch's model. We show that even a single qubit passing through a
postselected CTC (P-CTC) is sufficient to do any postselected quantum
measurement, and we discuss an important difference between ""Deutschian"" CTCs
(D-CTCs) and P-CTCs in which the future existence of a P-CTC might affect the
present outcome of an experiment. Then, based on a suggestion of Bennett and
Smith, we explicitly show how a party assisted by P-CTCs can distinguish a set
of linearly independent quantum states, and we prove that it is not possible
for such a party to distinguish a set of linearly dependent states. The power
of P-CTCs is thus weaker than that of D-CTCs because the Holevo bound still
applies to circuits using them regardless of their ability to conspire in
violating the uncertainty principle. We then discuss how different notions of a
quantum mixture that are indistinguishable in linear quantum mechanics lead to
dramatically differing conclusions in a nonlinear quantum mechanics involving
P-CTCs. Finally, we give explicit circuit constructions that can efficiently
factor integers, efficiently solve any decision problem in the intersection of
NP and coNP, and probabilistically solve any decision problem in NP. These
circuits accomplish these tasks with just one qubit traveling back in time, and
they exploit the ability of postselected closed timelike curves to create
grandfather paradoxes for invalid answers.

field theoretic demand of locality, or the requirement of P, T, CP, or CT
invariance, that makes invariance under the Lorentz group a necessity.
Originally it was conjectured that VSR operates at the Planck scale; we propose
that the natural arena for VSR is at energies similar to the standard model,
but in the dark sector. To this end we provide an ab initio spinor
representation invariant under the SIM(2) avatar of VSR and construct a mass
dimension one fermionic quantum field of spin one half. This field turns out to
be a very close sibling of Elko and it exhibits the same striking property of
intrinsic darkness with respect to the standard model fields. In the new
construct, the tension between Elko and Lorentz symmetries is fully resolved.
We thus entertain the possibility that the symmetries underlying the standard
model matter and gauge fields are those of Lorentz, while the event space
underlying the dark matter and the dark gauge fields supports the algebraic
structure underlying VSR.

distributions of electrons under a magnetic field, in order to obtain insights
into the various signature Hall effects in disordered armchair graphene
nanoribbons (AGNR). In the presence of a uniform perpendicular magnetic field
(B\perp-field), a perfect AGNR shows three distinct spatial current profiles at
equilibrium, depending on its width. Under non-equilibrium conditions (i.e. in
the presence of an applied bias), the net electron flow is restricted to the
edges and occurs in opposite directions depending on whether the Fermi level
lies within the valence or conduction band. For electrons at energy level below
the conduction window, the B\perp-field gives rise to local electron flux
circulation, although the global flux is zero. Our study also reveals the
suppression of electron backscattering as a result of the edge transport which
is induced by the B\perp-field. This phenomenon can potentially mitigate the
undesired effects of disorders, such as the bulk and edge vacancies, on the
transport properties of AGNR. Lastly, we show that the effect of B\perp-field
on electronic transport is less significant in the multimode compared to the
single mode electron transport.

that can significantly affect the overall performance of deadlock handling.
Excessive initiation of deadlock detection increases overall message usage,
resulting in degraded system performance in the absence of deadlocks; while
insufficient initiation of deadlock detection increases the deadlock
persistence time, resulting in an increased deadlock resolution cost in the
presence of deadlocks. The investigation of this performance tradeoff, however,
is missing in the literature. This paper studies the impact of deadlock
detection scheduling on the overall performance of deadlock handling. In
particular, we show that there exists an optimal deadlock detection frequency
that yields the minimum long-run mean average cost, which is determined by the
message complexities of the deadlock detection and resolution algorithms being
used, as well as the rate of deadlock formation, denoted as $\lambda$. For the
best known deadlock detection and resolution algorithms, we show that the
asymptotically optimal frequency of deadlock detection scheduling that
minimizes the overall message overhead is ${\cal O}((\lambda n)^{1/3})$, when
the total number $n$ of processes is sufficiently large. Furthermore, we show
that in general fully distributed (uncoordinated) deadlock detection scheduling

leptonic mapping matrix from the Harrison-Perkins-Scott (HPS) form. These
deviations are supposed to arise entirely from a perturbation of the mass
matrix in the charged lepton sector. The perturbing matrix is assumed to be
purely imaginary (thus maximally $T$-violating) and to have a strength in
energy scale no greater (but perhaps smaller) than the muon mass. As we shall
show, it then follows that the absolute value of the mapping matrix elements
pertaining to the tau lepton deviate by no more than $O((m_\mu/m_\tau)^2)
\simeq 3.5 \times 10^{-3}$ from their HPS values.
  Assuming that $(m_\mu/m_\tau)^2 $ can be neglected, we derive two simple
constraints on the four parameters $\theta_{12}$, $\theta_{23}$, $\theta_{31}$,
and $\delta$ of the mapping matrix. These constraints are independent of the
details of the imaginary $T$-violating perturbation of the charged lepton mass
matrix. We also show that the $e$ and $\mu$ parts of the mapping matrix have a
definite form governed by two parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$; any deviation of
order $m_\mu/m_\tau $ can be accommodated by adjusting these two parameters.

position angle is usually dominated by random pulse-to-pulse jitter of the
polarized subpulses. Even with these uncertainties, we find that the position
angle variations in 19 pulsars are significantly better fitted (at the 3
{\sigma} level) by a sinusoid than by a constant. Such variations could be
caused by precession, which would then indicate periods of ~ (200 - 1300) d and
amplitudes of ~(1 - 12) degrees. We narrow this collection to four pulsars that
show the most convincing evidence of sinusoidal variation in position angle.
Also, in a handful of pulsars, single discrepant position angle measurements
are observed which may result from the line of sight passing across a discrete
ionized, magnetized structure. We calculate the standard deviation of position
angle measurements from the mean for each pulsar, and relate these to limits on
precession and interstellar magnetic field variations.

presented based on a stochastic jump-transition model (Wheatland and Glukhov
1998; Wheatland 2008; Wheatland 2009). The magnetic free energy of the model
active region varies in time due to a prescribed (deterministic) rate of energy
input and prescribed (random) flare jumps downwards in energy. The model has
been shown to reproduce observed flare statistics, for specific
time-independent choices for the energy input and flare transition rates.
However, many solar active regions exhibit time variation in flare
productivity, as exemplified by NOAA active region AR 11029 (Wheatland 2010).
In this case a time-dependent model is needed. Time variation is incorporated
for two cases: 1. a step change in the rates of flare jumps; and 2. a step
change in the rate of energy supply to the system. Analytic arguments are
presented describing the qualitative behavior of the system in the two cases.
In each case the system adjusts by shifting to a new stationary state over a
relaxation time which is estimated analytically. The new model retains
flare-like event statistics. In each case the frequency-energy distribution is
a power law for flare energies less than a time-dependent rollover set by the
largest energy the system is likely to attain at a given time. For Case 1, the
model exhibits a double exponential waiting-time distribution, corresponding to
flaring at a constant mean rate during two intervals (before and after the step
change), if the average energy of the system is large. For Case 2 the
waiting-time distribution is a simple exponential, again provided the average
energy of the system is large. Monte Carlo simulations of Case~1 are presented
which confirm the analytic estimates. The simulation results provide a
qualitative model for observed flare statistics in active region AR 11029.

mechanism (an ""eccentricity trap"") to halt type I migration of planets near the
inner edge of a protoplanetary disk. Because asymmetric eccentricity damping
due to disk-planet interaction on the innermost planet at the disk edge plays a
crucial role in the trap, this mechanism requires continuous eccentricity
excitation and hence works for a resonantly interacting convoy of planets. This
trap is so strong that the edge torque exerted on the innermost planet can
completely halt type I migrations of many outer planets through mutual resonant
perturbations. Consequently, the convoy stays outside the disk edge, as a
whole. We have derived semi-analytical formula for the condition for the
eccentricity trap and predict how many planets are likely to be trapped. We
found that several planets or more should be trapped by this mechanism in
protoplanetary disks that have cavities. It can be responsible for the
formation of non-resonant, multiple, close-in super-Earth systems extending
beyond 0.1AU. Such systems are being revealed by radial velocity observations
to be quite common around solar-type stars.

(i.e. disc mass and profile) and star mass also play a crucial role in
determining whether a disc fragments or not as well as where in the disc
fragments form. We find that for shallow surface mass density profiles (p<2,
where \Sigma \propto R^{-p}), fragments form in the outer regions of the disc.
However for steep surface mass density profiles (p \gtrsim 2), fragments form
in the inner regions of a disc. In addition, we also find that the critical
value of the cooling timescale in units of the orbital timescale found in
previous simulations is only applicable to certain disc surface mass density
profiles and for particular disc radii and is not a general rule for all discs.

velocity of a cluster of galaxies relative to the CMB rest frame. Hence it
gives rise to the kSZ effect. We calculate this effect and compare it with

perturbation scenario at the time of decoupling, the drift velocity of clusters

use of directional statistics and synthetic focal mechanisms, I show that the
grid search methodology does yield appropriate uncertainty estimates. The
direct perturbation of the synthetic focal mechanisms introduces bias which
leads to confidence intervals which become increasingly too wide as the amount
of perturbation increases. The synthetic data also show at what point the
method fails to overcome this bias and when confidence intervals will be too
wide. The indirect perturbation of the focal mechanisms by perturbing the
generating deviatoric stress tensor generates synthetic data devoid of bias.
Inversion of these data sets yields correct confidence intervals. The Focal

background obtained from the two-year science run (S5) of the Laser
Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) is used to constrain the
average GW production of core collapse supernovae (ccSNe). We assume that the
ccSNe rate tracks the star formation history of the universe and show that the
stochastic background energy density depends only weakly on the assumed average
source spectrum. Using the ccSNe rate for $z\leq10$, we scale the generic
source spectrum to obtain an observation-based upper limit on the average GW
emission. We show that the mean energy emitted in GWs can be constrained within
$< (0.49-1.98){1mm} M_{\odot} c^{2}$ depending on the average source spectrum.
While these results are higher than the total available gravitational energy in
a core collapse event, second and third generation GW detectors will enable
tighter constraints to be set on the GW emission from such systems.

helioseismology. I describe in this review the methods currently used to
analyze these light curves. First, these data provide an accurate determination
of the stellar rotation rate. This is possible thanks to the magnetic activity
of stars. The power spectra of light curves put also constraints on the stellar
granulation, which can be directly compared to 3-D stellar atmosphere models;
this shows still unexplained discrepancies. I then detailed a standard method
for extracting p-mode characteristics (frequency, amplitude and lifetime).
CoRoT has revealed unexpected short life times for F stars. Last, I also
discuss errors and biases of mode frequencies, especially the ones due to the
simplified description of the rotation generally used.

protocol proposed by Doerr, Friedrich and Sauerwald [SODA 2008] on complete

originating from one vertex throughout the network. Each vertex is assumed to
have a (cyclic) list of its neighbors. Once a vertex is informed by one of its
neighbors, it chooses a position in its list uniformly at random and then
informs its neighbors starting from that position and proceeding in order of
the list. Angelopoulos, Doerr, Huber and Panagiotou [Electron.~J.~Combin.~2009]
showed that after $(1+o(1))(\log_2 n + \ln n)$ rounds, the rumor will have been
broadcasted to all nodes with probability $1 - o(1)$.
  We study the broadcast time when the amount of randomness available at each
node is reduced in natural way. In particular, we prove that if each node can
only make its initial random selection from every $\ell$-th node on its list,
then there exists lists such that $(1-\varepsilon) (\log_2 n + \ln n - \log_2
\ell - \ln \ell)+\ell-1$ steps are needed to inform every vertex with
probability at least $1-O\bigl(\exp\bigl(-\frac{n^\varepsilon}{2\ln

periodic and soliton solutions. The Toda lattice, as it came to be known, was
then extensively studied as one of the completely integrable
(differential-difference) non-linear equations which admit exact solutions in
terms of theta functions of hyperelliptic curves. In this paper, we extend
Toda's original approach to give hyperelliptic solutions of the Toda lattice in

identities are given by generalized addition formulae for the hyperelliptic

term in the Toda lattice theory) solutions of the Toda lattice correspond to
the zeros of Kiepert-Brioschi's division polynomials, and note these are
related to solutions of Poncelet's closure problem. One feature of our solution
is that the hyperelliptic curve is related in a non-trivial way to the one

anticipated from the variations of metallicity and surface gravity. The
colour-colour plots are perfectly consistent among the three samples, stars in

the differences (primarily metallicity) of the samples. We show that the g-r -

assembly earlier within the highly-biased region where the structure formation
has also started earlier. By means of halo occupation distribution (HOD) models
fitted to the observed angular correlation function, we infer the properties of
the underlying host dark halos. We find that the estimated bias factors and
host halo masses are systematically larger for galaxies with larger stellar
masses, which is consistent with the general agreement that the capability of
hosting massive galaxies depends strongly on halo mass. The estimated effective
halo masses are ~10^{14} Msun, which gives the stellar-mass to halo-mass ratios
of ~0.003. The observed evolution of bias factors indicates rapid evolution of
spatial distributions of cold dark matter relative to those traced by the
massive galaxies, while the transition of host halo masses might imply that the
fractional mass growth rate of halos is less than those of stellar systems. The
inferred halo masses and high fractions of central galaxies indicate that the
massive galaxies in the current sample are possibly equivalent to central

underlying bar may be present. The stellar densities in the two RCs changes
dramatically with longitude: on the positive longitude side the foreground RC
is dominant, while the background RC dominates negative longitudes. A line
connecting the maxima of the foreground and background populations is tilted to
the line of sight by ~20 +/-4 deg., similar to claims for the tilt of a
Galactic bar. The distance between the two RCs decreases towards the Galactic
plane; seen edge-on the bulge is X-shaped, resembling some extra-galactic
bulges and the results of N-body simulations. The center of this X is
consistent with the distance to the Galactic center, although better agreement
would occur if the bulge is 2-3 Gyr younger than 47 Tuc. Our observations may
be understood if the two RC populations emanate, nearly tangentially, from the
ends of a Galactic bar, each side shaped like a funnel or horn. Alternatively,
the X, or double funnel shape, may continue to the Galactic center. This would
appear peanut/box shaped from the Solar direction, but X-shaped when viewed
tangentially.

genome are poorly understood. The scale by which homology recognition takes
place is of a few tens of base pairs, after which the quest for homology is
over. To study the mechanism of homology recognition, RecA-promoted homologous
recombination between short DNA oligomers with different degrees of heterology
was studied in vitro, using fluorescence resonant energy transfer. RecA can
detect single mismatches at the initial stages of recombination, and the
efficiency of recombination is strongly dependent on the location and
distribution of mismatches. Mismatches near the 5' end of the incoming strand
have a minute effect, whereas mismatches near the 3' end hinder strand exchange
dramatically. There is a characteristic DNA length above which the sensitivity
to heterology decreases sharply. Experiments with competitor sequences with
varying degrees of homology yield information about the process of homology
search and synapse lifetime. The exquisite sensitivity to mismatches and the
directionality in the exchange process support a mechanism for homology
recognition that can be modeled as a kinetic proofreading cascade.

amounts to assume that $\theta_0$ is approximately sparse. This paper studies
the minimax risks of estimation and testing over classes of $k$-sparse vectors

high-dimensionality. The results encompass the problem of prediction

linear testing (testing $X\theta=0$). Interestingly, an elbow effect occurs
when the number of variables $k\log(p/k)$ becomes large compared to $n$.
Indeed, the minimax risks and hypothesis separation distances blow up in this
ultra-high dimensional setting. We also prove that even dimension reduction

two stars also display the distinct irradiation effect typical of sdB stars

Because the orbital period is so short, the stars should be in synchronous
rotation, and if so, the rotation period should imprint itself on the multiplet
structure of the pulsations. However, we do not find clear evidence for such
rotational splitting. Though the stars do show some frequency spacings that are
consistent with synchronous rotation, they also display multiplets with
splittings that are much smaller. Longer-duration time series photometry will
be needed to determine if those small splittings are in fact rotational
splitting, or caused by slow amplitude or phase modulation. Further data should
also improve the signal-to-noise, perhaps revealing lower amplitude
periodicities that could confirm the expectation of synchronous rotation. The
pulsation periods seen in these stars show period spacings that are suggestive
of high-overtone g-mode pulsations.

short review of the three-layer gravastar model with distinguished attention to
the structure of the pertinent parameter space of gravastars in equilibrium.
Then the radial stability of these types of gravastars is studied by
determining their response for the totally inelastic collision of their surface
layer with a dust shell. It is assumed that the dominant energy condition holds
and the speed of sound does not exceed that of the light in the matter of the
surface layer. While in the analytic setup the equation of state is kept to be
generic, in the numerical investigations three functionally distinct classes of
equations of states are applied. In the corresponding particular cases the
maximal mass of the dust shell that may fall onto a gravastar without
converting it into a black hole is determined. For those configurations which
remain stable the excursion of their radius is assigned. It is found that even
the most compact gravastars cannot get beyond the lower limit of the size of
conventional stars, provided that the dominant energy condition holds in both
cases. It is also shown---independent of any assumption concerning the matter
interbridging the internal de Sitter and the external Schwarzschild
regions---that the better is a gravastar in mimicking a black hole the easier
is to get the system formed by a dust shell and the gravastar beyond the event
horizon of the composite system. In addition, a generic description of the
totally inelastic collision of spherical shells in spherically symmetric
spacetimes is also provided in the appendix.

Cortez is applied to cilia and flagella-driven flows in biology.
Previously-published approaches implicitly combine the force discretisation and
the numerical quadrature used to evaluate boundary integrals. By contrast, a
boundary element method can be implemented by discretising the force using
basis functions, and calculating integrals using accurate numerical or analytic
integration. This substantially weakens the coupling of the mesh size for the
force and the regularisation parameter, and greatly reduces the number of
degrees of freedom required. When modelling a cilium or flagellum as a
one-dimensional filament, the regularisation parameter can be considered a
proxy for the body radius, as opposed to being a parameter used to minimise
numerical errors. Modelling a patch of cilia, it is found that: (1) For a fixed
number of cilia, reducing cilia spacing reduces transport. (2) For fixed patch
dimension, increasing cilia number increases the transport, up to a plateau at
$9\times 9$ cilia. Modelling a choanoflagellate cell it is found that the
presence of a lorica structure significantly affects transport and flow outside
the lorica, but does not significantly alter the force experienced by the
flagellum.

14 stars that are known to host planets and it does not support recent claims

without planets. We find the solar lithium abundance normal for a star of its
age, mass, and metallicity. Furthermore, we analyze published data for 82 stars
that were reported to support an enhanced lithium depletion in planet hosts. We
show that those stars in fact follow an age trend very similar to that found
