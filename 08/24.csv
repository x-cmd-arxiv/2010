probabilities are too small to observe this effect. The influence of initial
state fluctuations on this observable is explored using an event-by-event
(3+1)d hybrid approach that is based on UrQMD (Ultra-relativistic Quantum

momentum conservation and elliptic flow are explicitly taken into account. The
asymmetries in the initial state are translated to a final state momentum
asymmetry by the hydrodynamic flow profile. Dependent on the size of the
initial state fluctuations the resulting charged particle asymmetries are in
qualitative agreement with the preliminary STAR results. The multi-particle

disentangle the different contributions, however is in practice substantially

to provide independent, detailed studies to verify the methods used in the

dwarf stars with 0.3<(b-y)_0<1.0). We also evaluate available calibrations that
determine log g. A larger catalogue, in which metallicity is determined
directly from uvby photometry, is used to trace metallicity-dependent standard
sequences for dwarf stars. We derive new standard sequences in the c_1,0 versus

Ramirez & Me'endez (2005) for deriving metallicities from Stromgren photometry

This short-term behavior depends strongly on the initial state. For the initial
state tightly localized so that the initial transients are dominated by
over-the-barrier motion, the timescale for the flux propagation through the
barrier is close to the B\""uttiker-Landauer traversal time. Then a
quasistationary, slowly decay process follows, which sets ideal conditions for
observing diffraction in time at longer times and distances. To define
operationally a tunnelling time at the barrier edge, we extrapolate backwards
the propagation of the wave packet escaped from the potential. This
extrapolated time is considerably longer than the timescale of the flux and
density buildup at the barrier edge.

rotation period. In this paper, we revisit the published HARPS radial velocity
measurements of the object, which were previously used to estimate the
companion mass, but have been the subject of ongoing debate.
  We build a realistic model of the star's activity during the HARPS
observations, by fitting simultaneously the line width and the line bisector,
and use it to evaluate the contribution of activity to the RV variations. The
data show clear evidence of errors above the level of the formal uncertainties,
which are accounted for either by activity, nor by any plausible planet model,
and which increase rapidly with decreasing signal-to-noise of the spectra. We
cite evidence of similar systematics in mid-SNR spectra of other targets
obtained with HARPS and other high-precision RV spectrographs, and discuss
possible sources. Allowing for these, we re-evaluate the semi-amplitude of the
CoRoT-7b signal, finding Kb=1.6 +-1.3 m/s, a tentative detection with a much
reduced significance (1.2-sigma) compared to previous estimates. We also argue
that the combined presence of activity and additional errors preclude a
meaningful search for additional low-mass companions, despite previous claims
to the contrary.
  Our analysis points to a lower density for CoRoT-7b, the 1-sigma mass range
spanning 1-4 MEarth, allowing for a wide range of bulk compositions. In
particular, an ice-rich composition is compatible with the RV constraints. This
study highlights the importance of a realistic treatment of both activity and
uncertainties, particularly in the medium signal-to-noise ratio regime, which
applies to most small planet candidates from CoRoT and Kepler.

absorption. Here we explore the detectability of glint in the presence of an
atmosphere and realistic phase-dependent scattering from oceans and clouds. We
use the NASA Astrobiology Institute's Virtual Planetary Laboratory 3-D
line-by-line, multiple-scattering spectral Earth model to simulate Earth's
broadband visible brightness and reflectivity over an orbit. Our validated
simulations successfully reproduce phase-dependent Earthshine observations. We
find that the glinting Earth can be as much as 100% brighter at crescent phases
than simulations that do not include glint, and that the effect is dependent on
both orbital inclination and wavelength, where the latter dependence is caused
by Rayleigh scattering limiting sensitivity to the surface. We show that this
phenomenon may be observable using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) paired
with an external occulter.

dwarf and giant planetary companions to a magnitude-limited sample of ultracool
dwarfs. Using the NIRSPEC spectrograph on the Keck II telescope, we obtained
approximately 600 radial velocity measurements over a period of six years for a
sample of 59 late-M and L dwarfs spanning spectral types M8/L0 to L6. A
subsample of 46 of our targets have been observed on three or more epochs. We
rely on telluric CH4 absorption features in the Earth's atmosphere as a
simultaneous wavelength reference and exploit the rich set of CO absorption
features found in the K-band spectra of cool stars and brown dwarfs to measure
radial velocities and projected rotational velocities. For a bright, slowly
rotating M dwarf standard we demonstrate a radial velocity precision of 50 m/s,
and for slowly rotating L dwarfs we achieve a typical radial velocity precision
of approximately 200 m/s. This precision is sufficient for the detection of
close-in giant planetary companions to mid-L dwarfs as well as more equal mass
spectroscopic binary systems with small separations (a<2 AU). We present an
orbital solution for the subdwarf binary LSR1610-0040 as well as an improved
solution for the M/T binary 2M0320-04. We also combine our radial velocity
measurements with distance estimates and proper motions from the literature to
estimate the dispersion of the space velocities of the objects in our sample.
Using a kinematic age estimate we conclude that our UCDs have an age of
5.0+0.7-0.6 Gyr, similar to that of nearby sun-like stars. We simulate the
efficiency with which we detect spectroscopic binaries and find that the rate
of tight (a<1 AU) binaries in our sample is 2.5+8.6-1.6%, consistent with
recent estimates in the literature of a tight binary fraction of 3-4%.

their dust properties. We focus on Lyman-Break galaxies (LBGs) and Quasar (QSO)
hosts and likely progenitors of low- and high-mass present-day elliptical
galaxies, respectively. We have adopted a chemical evolution model for
elliptical galaxies taking account the dust production from low and
intermediate mass stars, supernovae Ia, supernovae II, QSOs and both dust
destruction and accretion processes. By means of such a model we have followed
the chemical evolution of ellipticals of different baryonic masses. Our model
complies with chemical downsizing. We made predictions for the abundance ratios
versus metallicity trends for models of differing masses that can be used to
constrain the star formation rate, initial mass function and dust mass in
observed galaxies. We predict the existence of a high redshift dust
mass-stellar mass relationship. We have found a good agreement with the
properties of LBGs if we assume that they formed at redshift z=2-4. In
particular, a non-negligible amount of dust is needed to explain the observed
abundance pattern. We studied the QSO SDSS J114816, one of the most distant QSO
ever observed (z=6.4), and we have been able to reproduce the amount of dust
measured in this object. The dust is clearly due to the production from
supernovae and the most massive AGB stars as well as from the grain growth in
the interstellar medium. The QSO dust is likely to dominate only in the very
central regions of the galaxies and during the early development of the
galactic wind.

phases in random Q-block copolymers built of incompatible monomer types A and B
with equal average concentrations. In our microscopic model, one block
comprises M identical monomers. The block-type sequence distribution is
Markovian and characterized by the correlation \lambda. Upon increasing the
incompatibility \chi\ (by decreasing temperature) in the disordered state, the
known ordered phases form: for \lambda\ > \lambda_c, two coexisting macroscopic
A- and B-rich phases, for \lambda\ < \lambda_c, a microstructured (lamellar)
phase with wave number k(\lambda). In addition, we find a fourth region in the
\lambda-\chi\ plane where these three phases coexist, with different,
non-Markovian sequence distributions (fractionation). Fractionation is revealed
by our analytically derived multiphase free energy, which explicitly accounts
for the exchange of individual sequences between the coexisting phases. The
three-phase region is reached, either, from the macroscopic phases, via a third
lamellar phase that is rich in alternating sequences, or, starting from the
lamellar state, via two additional homogeneous, homopolymer-enriched phases.
These incipient phases emerge with zero volume fraction. The four regions of
the phase diagram meet in a multicritical point (\lambda_c, \chi_c), at which
A-B segregation vanishes. The analytical method, which for the lamellar phase
assumes weak segregation, thus proves reliable particularly in the vicinity of
(\lambda_c, \chi_c). For random triblock copolymers, Q=3, we find the character
of this point and the critical exponents to change substantially with the
number M of monomers per block. The results for Q=3 in the continuous-chain
limit M -> \infty are compared to numerical self-consistent field theory

momentum space.Previous calculations using a Pauli-corrected ladder summation
to calculate the energy of a zero temperature many body system of spin 1/2
fermions with this interaction gave \xi=0.24 (in units of kinetic energy)
independent of density and with \Lambda---->infinity. This value of \xi is
appreciably smaller than the experimental and that obtained from other
calculations, most notably from Monte Carlo, which in principle would be the
most reliable. Our previous work did however also show a strong dependence on
effective range r_0 (with r_0=0 at unitarity). With an increase to r_0=1.0 the
energy varied from \xi~0.38 at k_f=0.6 1/fm to ~0.45 at k_f=1.8 1/fm which is
somewhat closer to the Monte-Carlo results. These previous calculations are
here extended by including the effect of the previously neglected mean-field
propagation, the dispersion correction. This is repulsive and found to increase
drastically with decreasing effective range. It is large enough to suggest a
revised value of \xi~0.4 <--> ~0.5 independent of r_0. Off-shell effects are
also investigated by introducing a rank-2 (phase-shift equivalent) separable
potential. Effects of 10% or more in energy could be demonstrated for r_0>0. It
is pointed out that a computational cut-off in momentum-space brings in another
scale in the in otherwise scale-less unitary problem.

investigate the impact of the late time evolution of the ejecta and of the
nuclear physics input on the calculated r-process abundances. Based on the
latest hydrodynamical simulations, heavy r-process elements cannot be
synthesized in the neutrino-driven winds that follow the supernova explosion.
However, by artificially increasing the wind entropy, elements up to A=195 can
be made. In this way one can reproduce the typical behavior of high-entropy
ejecta where the r-process is expected to occur. We identify which nuclear
physics input is more important depending on the dynamical evolution of the
ejecta. When the evolution proceeds at high temperatures (hot r-process), an
(n,g)-(g,n) equilibrium is reached. While at low temperature (cold r-process)
there is a competition between neutron captures and beta decays. In the first
phase of the r-process, while enough neutrons are available, the most relevant
nuclear physics input are the nuclear masses for the hot r-process and the
neutron capture and beta-decay rates for the cold r-process. At the end of this
phase, the abundances follow a steady beta flow for the hot r-process and a
steady flow of neutron captures and beta decays for the cold r-process. After
neutrons are almost exhausted, matter decays to stability and our results show
that in both cases neutron captures are key for determining the final
abundances, the position of the r-process peaks, and the formation of the
rare-earth peak. In all the cases studied, we find that the freeze out occurs
in a timescale of several seconds.

strength of economic relations between the pair of countries, and the strength

country, such as the USA, has the potential to spread globally, like the recent
crisis. Surprisingly we show that also countries with much lower GDP, such as
Belgium, are able to initiate a global crisis. Using the {\it k}-shell
decomposition method to quantify the spreading power (of a node), we obtain a
measure of ``centrality'' as a spreader of each country in the economic
network. We thus rank the different countries according to the shell they
belong to, and find the 12 most central countries. These countries are the most
likely to spread a crisis globally. Of these 12 only six are large economies,

hydrodynamical simulations. We use these MFs to estimate the stellar mass
density (SMD) of the universe to a fixed M_{UV,AB}<-18 as a function of
redshift and find a SMD growth \propto(1+z)^{-3.4 +/-0.8} from z 7 to z 4. We
also derive the SMD from the completeness-corrected MFs to a mass limit
M~10^{8} Msun. Such completeness-corrected MFs and the derived SMDs will be
particularly important for model comparisons as future MFs reach to lower
masses.

understood. Recently we rediscussed the problem of modelling the
double-periodic pulsation with non-linear hydrocodes. We showed that the
published non-resonant double-mode models are incorrect, because they exclude
the negative buoyancy effects. Aims. We continue our efforts to verify whether
the Kuhfuss one-equation convection model with negative buoyancy included can
reproduce the double-periodic Cepheid pulsation. Methods. Using the direct time
integration hydrocode, which implements the Kuhfuss convection model, we search
for stable double-periodic Cepheid models. We search for models pulsating in
both fundamental and first overtone modes (F+1O), as well as in the two lowest
order overtones (1O+2O). In the latter case, we focus on reproducing
double-overtone Cepheids of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Results. We have
found full amplitude non-linear beat Cepheid models of both types, F+1O and
1O+2O. In the case of F+1O models, the beat pulsation is most likely caused by
the three-mode resonance, 2omega_1=omega_0+omega_2, while in the
double-overtone models the underlying mechanism (resonant or non-resonant)
cannot be identified beyond doubt. Double-periodic models found in our survey
exist, however, only in narrow period ranges and cannot explain the majority of
the observed double-periodic objects. Conclusions. With only little doubt left,
we conclude that current one dimensional one-equation convection models are
incapable of reproducing the majority of the observed beat Cepheids. Among the
shortcomings of current pulsation hydrocodes, the simple treatment of
convection seems to be the most severe one. Growing evidence for the presence
of non-radial modes in Cepheids suggests that the interaction between radial
and non-radial modes should also be investigated.

hydrogen-ionizing photons and ionization-rate equations are calculated in a
suite of numerical simulations under various input parameters. The 2D genus is
calculated from the mock 21-cm images of the high-redshift Universe. We
construct the 2D genus curve by varying the threshold differential brightness
temperature, and compare this to the 2D genus curve of the underlying density
field. We find that (1) the 2D genus curve reflects the evolutionary track of
cosmic reionization and (2) the 2D genus curve can discriminate between certain
reionization scenarios and thus indirectly probe the properties of
radiation-sources. Choosing the right beam shape of a radio antenna is crucial
for this analysis. To this end, the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) is found to be
a suitable apparatus for this analysis in terms of sensitivity, even though
some deterioration of the data for this purpose is unavoidable under the
planned size of the antenna core.

$\mathbf{K}$ has a pole, then the form is a base change from $\Q$. We prove
this and further prove the analytic continuation of the L-function. This is one
of the first examples of using a trace formula to get such information. A hope

search for high frequency oscillations in the recurrent emission from the soft
gamma repeater SGR 1806-20, and we discuss the physical interpretation of these
oscillations and its implications on the neutron star properties and structure.
We present evidence for Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPOs) in the recurrent
outburst activity from SGR 1806-20 using RXTE observations. By searching for
timing signals at the frequencies of the QPOs discovered in the 2004 December
27 giant flare from the source, we find three QPOs at 84, 103, and 648 Hz in
three different bursts. The first two QPOs lie within 8.85% and 11.83%,
respectively, from the 92 Hz QPO detected in the giant flare. The third QPO lie
within 3.75% from the 625 Hz QPO also detected in the same flare. The detected
QPOs are found in bursts with different durations, morphologies, and
brightness, and are vindicated by Monte Carlo simulations. We also find
evidence for candidate QPOs at higher frequencies in other bursts with lower
statistical significance. The fact that we can find evidence for QPOs in the
recurrent bursts at frequencies relatively close to those found in the giant
flare is intriguing and can offer insight about the origin of the oscillations.
We confront our findings against the available theoretical models and discuss
the physical interpretation of these QPOs. The leading interpretation for the
origin of magnetar QPOs suggests that these toroidal seismic oscillatory modes
are most likely to be excited by a crustquake of the neutron star crust. Other
models have been proposed to explain the magnetar QPO phenomena including
magnetospheric oscillations, magnetic flux tubes and modes of a passive debris
disk. Theoretical modeling and observation of QPOs will be very useful in
putting stringent constraints on neutron star equation of state.

challenging, due to the reliability requirement that at each instant the load

challenge for smart grid with integrated wind generation, by leveraging
multi-timescale dispatch and scheduling. Specifically, we consider smart grids
with two classes of energy users - traditional energy users and opportunistic
energy users (e.g., smart meters or smart appliances), and investigate pricing
and dispatch at two timescales, via day-ahead scheduling and realtime
scheduling. In day-ahead scheduling, with the statistical information on wind
generation and energy demands, we characterize the optimal procurement of the
energy supply and the day-ahead retail price for the traditional energy users;
in realtime scheduling, with the realization of wind generation and the load of
traditional energy users, we optimize real-time prices to manage the
opportunistic energy users so as to achieve systemwide reliability. More
specifically, when the opportunistic users are non-persistent, i.e., a subset
of them leave the power market when the real-time price is not acceptable, we
obtain closedform solutions to the two-level scheduling problem. For the
persistent case, we treat the scheduling problem as a multitimescale Markov
decision process. We show that it can be recast, explicitly, as a classic
Markov decision process with continuous state and action spaces, the solution
to which can be found via standard techniques. We conclude that the proposed
multi-scale dispatch and scheduling with real-time pricing can effectively
address the volatility and uncertainty of wind generation and energy demand,

interest here are problems arising in power control applications, where network
utility is maximized subject to minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio
(SINR) constraints, maximum interference constraints, maximum received power
constraints, or simultaneous minimum and maximum SINR constraints. Especially
when the gradient iterations are executed in a disributed fashion, imperfect
exchanges among the link nodes may result in erroneous gradient vectors. In
order to assess and cope with such errors, two running averages (ergodic
sequences) are formed from the iterates generated by the perturbed saddle point
method, each with complementary strengths. Under the assumptions of problem
convexity and error boundedness, bounds on the constraint violation and the
suboptimality per iteration index are derived. The two types of running
averages are tested on a spectrum sharing problem with minimum and maximum SINR
constraints, as well as maximum interference constraints.

associated with sub-luminous gamma-ray bursts (SL-GRBs). We assume that the
central engines of a significant proportion of these bursts are provided by
newly born magnetars and consider two plausible GW emission mechanisms.
Firstly, the deformation-induced triaxial GW emission from a newly born
magnetar. Secondly, the onset of a secular bar-mode instability, associated
with the long lived plateau observed in the X-ray afterglows of many gamma-ray
bursts (Corsi & Meszaros 2009a). With regards to detectability, we find that
the onset of a secular instability is the most optimistic scenario: under the
hypothesis that SL-GRBs associated with secularly unstable magnetars occur at a
rate of (48; 80)Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1} or greater, cross-correlation of data from two
Einstein Telescopes (ETs) could detect the GW background associated to this
signal with a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 or greater after 1 year of
observation. Assuming neutron star spindown results purely from triaxial GW
emissions, we find that rates of around (130;350)Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1} will be
required by ET to detect the resulting GW background. We show that a background
signal from secular instabilities could potentially mask a primordial GW
background signal in the frequency range where ET is most sen- sitive. Finally,
we show how accounting for cosmic metallicity evolution can increase the
predicted signal-to-noise ratio for background signals associated with SL-GRBs.

mechanical stability: under increasing external strain all amorphous solids
respond elastically to small strains but have a finite yield stress which
cannot be exceeded without effecting a plastic response which typically leads
to mechanical failure. Understanding this is crucial for assessing the risk of
failure of glassy materials under mechanical loads. Here we show that the
statistics of the energy barriers \Delta E that need to be surmounted changes
from a probability distribution function (pdf) that goes smoothly to zero to a
pdf which is finite at \Delta E=0. This fundamental change implies a dramatic
transition in the mechanical stability properties with respect to external

can change our view of the many-body problem in quantum chemistry and solid
state physics. It was shown that the many-body treatment based on the
electron-vibrational Hamiltonian is fundamentally inconsistent with the
Born-Handy ansatz so that such a treatment can never respect the COM problem.
Born-Oppenheimer (B-O) approximation reveals some secret: it is a limit case
where the degrees of freedom can be treated in a classical way. Beyond the B-O
approximation they are inseparable in principle. The unique covariant
description of all equations with respect to individual degrees of freedom
leads to new types of interaction: besides the known vibronic (electron-phonon)
one the rotonic (electron-roton) and translonic (electron-translon)
interactions arise. We have proved that due to the COM problem only the
hypervibrations (hyperphonons, i.e. phonons + rotons + translons) have true
physical meaning in molecules and crystals; nevertheless, the use of pure
vibrations (phonons) is justified only in the adiabatic systems. This fact
calls for the total revision of our contemporary knowledge of all non-adiabatic
effects, especially the Jahn-Teller effect and superconductivity. The vibronic
coupling is responsible only for removing of electron (quasi)degeneracies but
for the explanation of symmetry breaking and forming of structure the rotonic
and translonic coupling is necessary.

velocity applied at the wall and travelling along the streamwise direction.
Laminar and turbulent regimes for the streamwise flow are both studied.
  When the streamwise flow is laminar, it is unaffected by the spanwise flow
induced by the waves. This flow is a thin, unsteady and streamwise-modulated
boundary layer that can be expressed in terms of the Airy function of the first
kind. We name it the generalized Stokes layer because it reduces to the
classical oscillating Stokes layer in the limit of infinite wave speed.
  When the streamwise flow is turbulent, the laminar generalized Stokes layer
solution describes well the space-averaged turbulent spanwise flow, provided
that the phase speed of the waves is sufficiently different from the turbulent
convection velocity, and that the time scale of the forcing is smaller than the
life time of the near-wall turbulent structures. Under these conditions, the
drag reduction is found to scale with the Stokes layer thickness, which renders
the laminar solution instrumental for the analysis of the turbulent flow.
  A classification of the turbulent flow regimes induced by the waves is
presented by comparing parameters related to the forcing conditions with the
space and time scales of the turbulent flow.

simulations, taking into account turbulence and magnetic fields. By using the
adaptive mesh refinement technique, the collapse is followed over a wide
dynamic range from the scale of a turbulent cloud core to that of the first
core. The cloud core is lumpy in the low density region owing to the
turbulence, while it has a smooth density distribution in the dense region
produced by the collapse. The shape of the dense region depends mainly on the
mass of the cloud core; a massive cloud core tends to be prolate while a less
massive cloud core tends to be oblate. In both cases, anisotropy of the dense
region increases during the isothermal collapse. The minor axis of the dense
region is always oriented parallel to the local magnetic field. All the models
eventually yield spherical first cores supported mainly by the thermal
pressure. Most of turbulent cloud cores exhibit protostellar outflows around
the first cores. These outflows are classified into two types, bipolar and
spiral flows, according to the morphology of the associated magnetic field.
Bipolar flow often appears in the less massive cloud core. The rotation axis of
the first core is oriented parallel to the local magnetic field for bipolar
flow, while the orientation of the rotation axis from the global magnetic field
depends on the magnetic field strength. In spiral flow, the rotation axis is
not aligned with the local magnetic field.

interacting galaxy system IRAS 20210+1121 at z = 0.056. An XMM-Newton
observation reveals the presence of an obscured (Nh ~ 5 x 10^{23} cm^-2),
Seyfert-like (L_{2-10 keV} = 4.7 x 10^{42} erg/s) nucleus in the northern
galaxy, which lacks unambiguous optical AGN signatures. Our spectral analysis
also provides strong evidence that the IR-luminous southern galaxy hosts a Type
2 quasar embedded in a bright starburst emission. In particular, the X-ray
primary continuum from the nucleus appears totally depressed in the XMM-Newton
band as expected in case of a Compton-Thick absorber, and only the emission
produced by Compton scattering ('reflection') of the continuum from
circumnuclear matter is seen. As such, IRAS 20210+1121 seems to provide an
excellent opportunity to witness a key, early phase in the quasar evolution
predicted by the theoretical models of quasar activation by galaxy collisions.

conducted with the 100-m radio telescope in Effelsberg in Oct-Nov 2007 at the
frequencies of 8.5 and 15.1 GHz as part of an extensive campaign of
multi-station multi-frequency observations of the Crab pulsar. A selection of
the strongest pulses was recorded with a new data acquisition system, based on
a fast digital oscilloscope, providing nanosecond time resolution in two
polarizations in a bandwidth of about 500 MHz. We analyzed the pulse shapes,
polarisation and dynamic spectra of GPs as well as the cross-correlations
between their LHC and RHC signals. No events were detected outside main pulse
and interpulse windows. GP properties were found to be very different for GPs
emitted at longitudes of the main pulse and the interpulse. Cross-correlations
of the LHC and RHC signals show regular patterns in the frequency domain for
the main pulse, but these are missing for the interpulse GPs. We consider
consequences of application of the rotating vector model to explain the
apparent smooth variation in the position angle of linear polarization for main
pulse GPs.
  We also introduce a new scenario of GP generation as a direct consequence of
the polar cap discharge. We find further evidence for strong nano-shot
discharges in the magnetosphere of the Crab pulsar. The repetitive frequency
spectrum seen in GPs at the main pulse phase is interpreted as a diffraction
pattern of regular structures in the emission region. The interpulse GPs
however have a spectrum that resembles that of amplitude modulated noise.

accomplished by solving the stochastic Maxwell-Bloch equations with the
finite-difference time-domain method. Below lasing threshold, the continuous
emission spectra are narrowed by frequency-dependent amplification. Our
simulations reproduce the stochastic emission spikes in the spectra.
Well-defined peaks, corresponding to the system resonances, emerge at higher
pumping and are narrowed by stimulated emission before lasing takes place.
Noise tends to distribute pump energy over many modes, resulting in multi-mode
operation. Well above the lasing threshold, the effects of noise lessen and
results become similar to those without noise. By comparing systems of
different scattering strength, we find that weaker scattering extends the
transition region from ASE to lasing, where the effects of noise are most
significant.

These (1) and (2) solve a random analogy of the most famous open conjecture in
complex dynamics ""hyperbolic rational maps are dense in the space of rational

continuous function under the transition operator tends exponentially fast to
the finite-dimensional space $U$ of finite linear combinations of unitary
eigenvectors of the transition operator. From this, we obtain that the spectrum

with the perturbation theory for linear operators, we obtain that for a stable
system constructed by a finite family of rational maps, the projection to the

partial derivative of the function of probability of tending to a minimal set

polarization alone and with respect to target polarization combined with beam
helicity and/or beam charge. The asymmetries appear in the distribution of the
real photons in the azimuthal angle $\phi$ around the virtual photon direction,
relative to the lepton scattering plane. The asymmetries arise from the deeply
virtual Compton scattering process and its interference with the Bethe-Heitler
process. The results for the beam-charge and beam-helicity asymmetries from a
tensor polarized deuterium target with vanishing vector polarization are shown
to be compatible with those from an unpolarized deuterium target, which is
expected for incoherent scattering dominant at larger momentum transfer.
Furthermore, the results for the single target-spin asymmetry and for the
double-spin asymmetry are found to be compatible with the corresponding
asymmetries previously measured on a hydrogen target. For coherent scattering
on the deuteron at small momentum transfer to the target, these findings imply
that the tensor contribution to the cross section is small. Furthermore, the
tensor asymmetry is found to be compatible with zero.

widely represented by the attractive electrostatic interaction between ER
particles. By shearing ER fluids between two concentric cylinders, we show a
reversible shear thickening of ER fluids above a low critical shear rate (<1
s-1) and a high critical electric field strength (>100 V/mm), which could be
characterized by a modified Mason number. Shear thickening and electrostatic
particle interaction-induced inter-particle friction forces is considered to be
the real origin of the high shear strength of ER fluids, while the applied

high-performance ER/magnetorheological (MR) fluid design, clutch fluids with

radio can eavesdrop on the primary's ARQs. Assuming the primary channel states
follow a Markov chain, this feedback gives the cognitive radio an indication of
the primary link quality. Based on the ACK/NACK received, we devise optimal
transmission strategies for the cognitive radio so as to maximize a weighted
sum of primary and secondary throughput. The actual weight used during network
operation is determined by the degree of protection afforded to the primary
link. We study a two-state model where we characterize a scheme that spans the

applications in artificial intelligence, e.g., classification and event
recognition. However, popular SVM solvers are not sufficiently efficient for
applications with a great deal of samples as well as a large number of
features. In this paper, thus, we present NESVM, a fast gradient SVM solver
that can optimize various SVM models, e.g., classical SVM, linear programming
SVM and least square SVM. Compared against SVM-Perf
\cite{SVM_Perf}\cite{PerfML} (its convergence rate in solving the dual SVM is
upper bounded by $\mathcal O(1/\sqrt{k})$, wherein $k$ is the number of
iterations.) and Pegasos \cite{Pegasos} (online SVM that converges at rate
$\mathcal O(1/k)$ for the primal SVM), NESVM achieves the optimal convergence
rate at $\mathcal O(1/k^{2})$ and a linear time complexity. In particular,
NESVM smoothes the non-differentiable hinge loss and $\ell_1$-norm in the
primal SVM. Then the optimal gradient method without any line search is adopted
to solve the optimization. In each iteration round, the current gradient and
historical gradients are combined to determine the descent direction, while the
Lipschitz constant determines the step size. Only two matrix-vector
multiplications are required in each iteration round. Therefore, NESVM is more
efficient than existing SVM solvers. In addition, NESVM is available for both
linear and nonlinear kernels. We also propose ""homotopy NESVM"" to accelerate
NESVM by dynamically decreasing the smooth parameter and using the continuation
method. Our experiments on census income categorization, indoor/outdoor scene
classification, event recognition and scene recognition suggest the efficiency
and the effectiveness of NESVM. The MATLAB code of NESVM will be available on

10830 multiplet. From the Doppler shifts of these lines we retrieve the
variation of the velocity along the line-of-sight at several heights. Phase
spectra are used to obtain the relation between the oscillatory signals. Our
analysis reveals standing waves at frequencies lower than 4 mHz and a
continuous propagation of waves at higher frequencies, which steepen into
shocks in the chromosphere when approaching the formation height of the Ca II H
core. The observed non-linearities are weaker in Ca II H than in He I lines.
Our analysis suggests that the Ca II H core forms at a lower height than the He
I 10830 line: a time delay of about 20 s is measured between the Doppler signal
detected at both wavelengths. We fit a model of linear slow magnetoacoustic
wave propagation in a stratified atmosphere with radiative losses according to
Newton's cooling law to the phase spectra and derive the difference in the
formation height of the spectral lines. We show that the linear model describes
well the wave propagation up to the formation height of Ca II H, where
non-linearities start to become very important.

elasticity in a nonlinear setting using orthogonal matrices. The proposed

equilibrium equations of static linear elasticity. An appropriate kinetic
energy is identified and we present a dynamical model of rotational elasticity.
The propagation of elastic waves in such a medium is studied and we find two
classes of waves, transversal rotational waves and longitudinal rotational
waves, both of which are solutions of the nonlinear partial differential
equations. For certain parameter choices, the transversal wave velocity can be
greater than the longitudinal wave velocity. Moreover, parameter ranges are
identified where the model describes an auxetic material. However, in all cases
the potential energy functional is positive definite. Finally, we couple the
rotational waves to linear elastic waves to study the behaviour of the coupled
system. We find wave like solutions to the coupled equations and can visualise
our results with the help of suitable figures.

and biotechnology. For about two decades, knowledge based potentials based on
pairwise distances -- so-called ""potentials of mean force"" (PMFs) -- have been
center stage in the prediction and design of protein structure and the
simulation of protein folding. However, the validity, scope and limitations of
these potentials are still vigorously debated and disputed, and the optimal
choice of the reference state -- a necessary component of these potentials --
is an unsolved problem. PMFs are loosely justified by analogy to the reversible
work theorem in statistical physics, or by a statistical argument based on a
likelihood function. Both justifications are insightful but leave many
questions unanswered. Here, we show for the first time that PMFs can be seen as
approximations to quantities that do have a rigorous probabilistic
justification: they naturally arise when probability distributions over
different features of proteins need to be combined. We call these quantities
reference ratio distributions deriving from the application of the reference
ratio method. This new view is not only of theoretical relevance, but leads to
many insights that are of direct practical use: the reference state is uniquely
defined and does not require external physical insights; the approach can be
generalized beyond pairwise distances to arbitrary features of protein
structure; and it becomes clear for which purposes the use of these quantities
is justified. We illustrate these insights with two applications, involving the
radius of gyration and hydrogen bonding. In the latter case, we also show how
the reference ratio method can be iteratively applied to sculpt an energy
funnel. Our results considerably increase the understanding and scope of energy
functions derived from known biomolecular structures.

vicinity of a metallic single-wall carbon nanotube (SWNT) was examined
theoretically. The emitter-SWNT coupling strongly depends on the position of
the emitter relative to the SWNT, the length of the SWNT, the dipole transition
frequency and the orientation of the emitter. In the high-frequency regime,
dips in the spectrum of the spontaneous decay rate exist at the resonance
frequencies in the spectrum of the SWNT conductivity. In the
intermediate-frequency regime, the SWNT conductivity is very low, and the
spontaneous decay rate is practically unaffected by the SWNT. In the
low-frequency regime, the spectrum of the spontaneous decay rate contains
resonances at the antennas resonance frequencies for surface-wave propagation
in the SWNT. Enhancement of both the total and radiative spontaneous decay
rates by several orders in magnitude is predicted at these resonance
frequencies. The strong emitter-field coupling is achieved, in spite of the low
Q factor of the antenna resonances, due to the very high magnitude of the
electromagnetic field in the near-field zone. The vacuum Rabi oscillations of
the population of the excited emitter state are exhibited when the emitter is
coupled to an antenna resonance of the SWNT.

  Aims: we study the influence of the convective motions onto the amplitude and
the nonlinear saturation of acoustic modes excited by kappa-mechanism. We are
interested in determining the physical conditions needed to lead to a quenching
of oscillations by convection.
  Methods: we compute two-dimensional nonlinear simulations (DNS) of the
convection-pulsation coupling, in which the oscillations are sustained by a
continuous physical process: the kappa-mechanism. Thanks to both a frequential
analysis and a projection of the physical fields onto an acoustic subspace, we
study how the convective motions affect the unstable radial oscillations.
  Results: depending on the initial physical conditions, two main behaviours
are obtained: (i) either the unstable fundamental acoustic mode has a large
amplitude, carries the bulk of the kinetic energy and shows a nonlinear
saturation similar to the purely radiative case; (ii) or the convective motions
affect significantly the mode amplitude that remains very weak. In this second
case, convection is quenching the acoustic oscillations. We interpret these
discrepancies in terms of the difference in density contrast: larger
stratification leads to smaller convective plumes that do not affect much the
purely radial modes, while large-scale vortices may quench the oscillations.

lacked a clear gauge-theory specification of the initial state. We show how to
set up a well-defined gauge theory problem to study jet stopping in pure {\cal
N}=4 super Yang Mills theory (somewhat analogous to Hofman and Maldacena's
studies at zero temperature) and solve it by using gauge-gravity duality for
real-time, finite-temperature 3-point correlators. Previous studies have found
that the stopping distance scales with energy as E^{1/3} (with disagreement on
the gauge coupling dependence). We do find that none of the jet survives beyond
this scale, but we find that almost all of our jet stops at a parametrically
smaller scale proportional to (E L)^{1/4}, where L is the size of the
space-time region where the jet is initially created.

the theory of covering dimension to noncommutative spaces. We extend its
definition to general C*-algebras, and give an algebraic (as opposed to
functional-theoretic) reformulation. This yields new permanence properties for
the radius of comparison which strengthen its analogy with covering dimension
for commutative spaces. We then give several applications of these results. New
examples of C*-algebras with finite radius of comparison are given, and the
question of when the Cuntz classes of finitely generated Hilbert modules form a
hereditary subset of the Cuntz semigroup is addressed. Most interestingly,
perhaps, we treat the question of when a full hereditary subalgebra B of a
stable C*-algebra A is itself stable, giving a characterization in terms of the
radius of comparison. We also use the radius of comparison to quantify the
least n for which a C*-algebra D without bounded 2-quasitraces or unital
quotients has the property that M_n(D) is stable.

However, currently, even within the same database signaling pathways are often

major signaling pathways from Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster,

compiled pathways with semi-automatic searches and uniform, well-documented

cross-talks and found pathway-specific expression profiles. In addition, we
identified 327 proteins relevant for drug target discovery. Conclusions: We
provide a novel resource for comparative and cross-talk analyses of signaling

aspects of MFM descriptions is the presence of a high dimensional parameter
space capturing neurobiological attributes relevant to brain dynamics. We study
the physiological parameter space of a MFM of electrocortical activity and
discover robust correlations between physiological attributes of the model
cortex and its dynamical features. These correlations are revealed by the study
of bifurcation plots, which show that the model responses to changes in
inhibition belong to two families. After investigating and characterizing
these, we discuss their essential differences in terms of four important
aspects: power responses with respect to the modeled action of anesthetics,
reaction to exogenous stimuli, distribution of model parameters and oscillatory
repertoires when inhibition is enhanced. Furthermore, while the complexity of
sustained periodic orbits differs significantly between families, we are able
to show how metamorphoses between the families can be brought about by
exogenous stimuli. We unveil links between measurable physiological attributes
of the brain and dynamical patterns that are not accessible by linear methods.
They emerge when the parameter space is partitioned according to bifurcation
responses. This partitioning cannot be achieved by the investigation of only a
small number of parameter sets, but is the result of an automated bifurcation
analysis of a representative sample of 73,454 physiologically admissible sets.
Our approach generalizes straightforwardly and is well suited to probing the

strongest emission, which we model with a Gaussian ring,occurs within a radius
of 5 kpc. Weaker disk emission is detected out to radii of 12 kpc, the most
extensive molecular component yet seen in this galaxy. From comparisons with
infrared data, we find that CO(J=3-2) emission more closely follows the hot
dust component, rather than the cold dust,consistent with it being a good
tracer of star formation. The first maps of $R_{3-2/1-0}$, H$_2$ mass surface
density and SFE have been made for the inner 2.4 kpc radius region. Only 20\%
of the SF occurs in this region and excitation conditions are typical of galaxy
disks, rather than of central starbursts. The SFE suggests long gas consumption
timescales ($>$ $10^9$ yr).
  The velocity field is dominated by a steeply rising rotation curve in the
region of the central molecular ring followed by a flatter curve in the disk. A
very steep gradient in the rotation curve is observed at the nucleus, providing
the first evidence for a central concentration of mass:
M$_{dyn}\,=\,5\,\times\,10^7$ M$_\odot$ within a radius of 282 pc. The velocity
field shows anomalous features indicating the presence of molecular outflows;
one of them is associated with a previously observed CO(J=1-0) expanding shell.
Consistent with these outflows is the presence of a thick ($z$ up to $1.4$ kpc)
CO(J=3-2) disk. We suggest that the interaction between NGC~4631 and its
companion(s) has agitated the disk and also initiated star formation which was
likely higher in the past than it is now. These may be necessary conditions for
seeing prominent halos.

also reasonably well quantitatively with the available experimental results. An
analysis of exchange interactions is provided for a deeper understanding of the
problem. The dopant atoms perturb electronic structure close to the Fermi

rule. The dominating contribution to the temperature-dependent resistivity is
due to thermodynamical fluctuations originating from the spin-disorder, which,

K_q=0 for q>x, and K_q>0 for q<x, with x the Parisi parameter. The hypothesis
of a nonequilibrium effective temperature may also be directly tested directly
from configurations.

operator algebras, the Hardy algebras, and their representation theory. We view
these algebras as algebras of (operator valued) functions on their spaces of
representations. We will show that these spaces of representations can be
parameterized as unit balls of certain $W^{*}$-correspondences and the
functions can be viewed as Schur class operator functions on these balls. We
will provide evidence to show that the elements in these (non commutative)
Hardy algebras behave very much like bounded analytic functions and the study
of these algebras should be viewed as noncommutative function theory.

computer science and artificial intelligence: it provides a common framework
for many theoretical problems as well as for many real-life applications. Soft
constraint problems are a generalisation of the CSP which allow the user to
model optimisation problems. Considerable effort has been made in identifying
properties which ensure tractability in such problems. In this work, we
initiate the study of hybrid tractability of soft constraint problems; that is,
properties which guarantee tractability of the given soft constraint problem,
but which do not depend only on the underlying structure of the instance (such
as being tree-structured) or only on the types of soft constraints in the
instance (such as submodularity). We present several novel hybrid classes of
soft constraint problems, which include a machine scheduling problem,
constraint problems of arbitrary arities with no overlapping nogoods, and the
SoftAllDiff constraint with arbitrary unary soft constraints. An important tool
in our investigation will be the notion of forbidden substructures.

energetic jets moving through a viscous medium. For the scenario of an
unstoppable jet we observe a clearly strong collective behavior for a low
dissipative system $\eta/s \approx 0.005$, leading to the observation of
cone-like structures. Increasing the dissipation of the system to $\eta/s
\approx 0.32$ the Mach Cone structure vanishes. Furthermore, we investigate
jet-associated particle correlations. A double-peak structure, as observed in
experimental data, is even for low-dissipative systems not supported, because
of the large influence of the head shock.

carried out with Nitrogen concentrations up to 15% and a drift electric feld in
the range 0-50 kV/cm. A prediction for proton ionization signals is made by
means of interpolation. This study has been conducted in view of the possible
use of liquid Ar-N2 TPCs for the detection of gamma-rays in the resonant band
