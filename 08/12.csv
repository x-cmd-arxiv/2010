experimental features, such as semi-circle laws and duality relations, whose
accuracy and robustness are difficult to explain directly in terms of the
detailed dynamics of the microscopic electrons. They would naturally follow if
the low-energy transport properties were governed by an emergent discrete
duality group relating the different plateaux, but no explicit examples of
interacting systems having such a group are known. Recent progress using the
AdS/CFT correspondence has identified examples with similar duality groups, but
without the DC ohmic conductivity characteristic of quantum Hall experiments.
We use this to propose a simple holographic model for low-energy quantum Hall
systems, with a nonzero DC conductivity that automatically exhibits all of the
observed consequences of duality, including the existence of the plateaux and
the semi-circle transitions between them. The model can be regarded as a
strongly coupled analog of the old `composite boson' picture of quantum Hall
systems. Non-universal features of the model can be used to test whether it
describes actual materials, and we comment on some of these in our proposed
model.

In agreement with recent spectroscopic and transport measurements, we predict a
stabilization of such redox processes (and hence Ti 3$d$ occupation) with film
thickness beyond a critical value, which can be smaller than the critical
thickness for 2D electronic conduction, since the surface defects generate
trapping potentials that will affect the interface electron mobility. Several

affine-linear quadrilateral P$\Delta$Es possessing this property, leading to
the so-called ABS list. Recently, a new variational principle has been proposed
that describes the multidimensional consistency in terms of discrete Lagrangian
multi-forms. This description is based on a fundamental and highly nontrivial
property of Lagrangians for those integrable lattice equations, namely the fact
that on the solutions of the corresponding P$\Delta$E the Lagrange forms are

possess the property of multidimensional consistency. In this paper we
establish a universal Lagrange structure for affine-linear quad-lattices

simplicity and their ability to reproduce various spiking patterns of cortical
neurons, and are particularly used for large network simulations. These models
describe the dynamics of the membrane potential by a nonlinear differential
equation that blows up in finite time, coupled to a second equation for
adaptation. Spikes are emitted when the membrane potential blows up or reaches
a cutoff value. The precise simulation of the spike times and of the adaptation
variable is critical for it governs the spike pattern produced, and is hard to
compute accurately because of the exploding nature of the system at the spike
times. We thoroughly study the precision of fixed time-step integration schemes
for this type of models and demonstrate that these methods produce systematic
errors that are unbounded, as the cutoff value is increased, in the evaluation
of the two crucial quantities: the spike time and the value of the adaptation
variable at this time. Precise evaluation of these quantities therefore involve
very small time steps and long simulation times. In order to achieve a fixed
absolute precision in a reasonable computational time, we propose here a new
algorithm to simulate these systems based on a variable integration step method
that either integrates the original ordinary differential equation or the
equation of the orbits in the phase plane, and compare this algorithm with
fixed time-step Euler scheme and other more accurate simulation algorithms.

biologists from a chromatin organization deciphering point of view, and for
physicists from the study of polyelectrolyte interactions point of view. Hence,
H1/DNA binding processes, structural and dynamical information about these
self-assemblies is of broad importance. Targeting a quantitative understanding
of H1 induced DNA compaction mechanisms our strategy is based on using small
angle X-ray microdiffraction in combination with microfluidics. The usage of
microfluidic hydrodynamic focusing devices facilitate a microscale control of
these self-assembly processes. In addition, the method enables time-resolved
access to structure formation in situ, in particular to transient intermediate
states. The observed time dependent structure evolution shows that the
interaction of H1 with DNA can be described as a two step process: an initial
unspecific binding of H1 to DNA is followed by a rearrangement of molecules
within the formed assemblies. The second step is most likely induced by
interactions between the charged side chains of the protein and DNA. This leads
to an increase in lattice spacing within the DNA/protein assembly and induces a
decrease in the correlation length of the mesophases, probably due to a local
bending of the DNA.

prerequisite for quantum information processing. Dynamical decoupling (DD) is
one of the most effective experimental methods for maintaining coherence,
especially when one can access only the qubit-system and not its environment
(bath). It involves the application of pulses to the system whose net effect is
a reversal of the system-environment interaction. In any real system, however,
the environment is not static, and therefore the reversal of the
system-environment interaction becomes imperfect if the spacing between
refocusing pulses becomes comparable to or longer than the correlation time of
the environment. The efficiency of the refocusing improves therefore if the
spacing between the pulses is reduced. Here, we quantify the efficiency of
different DD sequences in preserving different quantum states. We use 13C
nuclear spins as qubits and an environment of 1H nuclear spins as the
environment, which couples to the qubit via magnetic dipole-dipole couplings.
Strong dipole-dipole couplings between the proton spins result in a rapidly
fluctuating environment with a correlation time of the order of 100 us. Our
experimental results show that short delays between the pulses yield better
performance if they are compared with the bath correlation time. However, as
the pulse spacing becomes shorter than the bath correlation time, an optimum is
reached. For even shorter delays, the pulse imperfections dominate over the
decoherence losses and cause the quantum state to decay.

either heavy ordinary neutrinos or more recently light sterile neutrinos (SNs)
with a mass around 11eV - to be relieved of problems ranging from cosmological
scales down to intermediate ones relevant for galaxy clusters. Here we suggest
using gravitational lensing by galaxy clusters to test such a marriage of
neutrino HDM and modified gravity, adopting the framework of
tensor-vector-scalar theory (TeVeS). Unlike conventional cold dark matter
(CDM), such HDM is subject to strong phase-space constraints, which allows one
to check cluster lens models inferred within the modified framework for
consistency. Since the considered HDM particles cannot collapse into
arbitrarily dense clumps and only form structures well above the galactic
scale, systems which indicate the need for dark substructure are of particular
interest. As a first example, we study the cluster lens Abell 2390 and its
impressive straight arc with the help of numerical simulations. Based on our
results, we outline a general and systematic approach to model cluster lenses
in TeVeS which significantly reduces the calculation complexity. We further
consider a simple bimodal lens configuration, capable of producing the straight
arc, to demonstrate our approach. We find that such a model is marginally
consistent with the hypothesis of 11eV SNs. Future work including more detailed
and realistic lens models may further constrain the necessary SN distribution
and help to conclusively assess this point. Cluster lenses could therefore
provide an interesting discriminator between CDM and such modified gravity
scenarios supplemented by SNs or other choices of HDM.

Membranes form spontaneously when suitable water-in-oil emulsions are forced
into micro-fluidic channels at high dispersed-phase volume fractions. They turn
out to be remarkably stable even when pumped through the micro-fluidic channel
system. Their geometric arrangement is self-assembling, driven by interfacial
energy and wetting forces. The ordered membrane arrays thus emerging can be
loaded with amphiphilic functional molecules, ion channels, or just be used as
they are, exploiting their peculiar physical properties. For wet electronic
circuitry, the aqueous droplets then serve as the 'solder points'. Furthermore,
the membranes can serve as well-controlled coupling media between chemical
processes taking place in adjacent droplets. This is shown for the well-known
Belousov-Zhabotinski reaction. Suitable channel geometries can be used to (re-)
arrange the droplets, and thereby their contents, in a controlled way by just
moving the emulsion through the device. It thereby appears feasible to
construct complex devices out of molecular-size components in a self-assembled,

unique correlated phase that emerges is predicted to be gapped with

exponentially as these quasiparticles are introduced. Interestingly, the only
way to transform between the many ground states would be to braid the

localized quasiparticles at nu=5/2, confined to puddles by disorder. Using a
local electrometer to compare how quasiparticles at nu=5/2 and nu=7/3 charge
these puddles, we are able to extract the ratio of local charges for these

ratio to be 4/3, suggesting that the local charges are e/3 at seven thirds and
e/4 at five halves, in agreement with theoretical predictions. This
confirmation of localized e/4 quasiparticles is necessary for proposed
interferometry experiments to test statistics and computational ability of the

calculate the asymptotic behavior of the internal radial and tangential kinetic
energy profiles in different radial regimes. We then numerically compute the
velocity anisotropy and pseudo-phase-space density profiles and compare them to
recent N-body simulations. For cosmological initial conditions, we find both
numerically and analytically that the anisotropy profile asymptotes at small
radii to a constant set by model parameters. It rises on intermediate scales as
the velocity dispersion becomes more radially dominated and then drops off at
radii larger than the virial radius where the radial velocity dispersion
vanishes in our model. The pseudo-phase-space density is universal on
intermediate and large scales. However, its asymptotic slope on small scales
depends on the halo mass and on how mass shells are torqued after turnaround.
The results largely confirm N-body simulations but show some differences that
are likely due to our assumption of a one-dimensional phase space manifold.

carried by the jet itself. We have reasons to believe that powerful gamma-ray
flat spectrum radio sources emit most of their radiation where radiative
cooling is severe. This helps to find the minimum number of emitting leptons
needed to explain the radiation we see. The number of protons is more
uncertain. If there is one proton per electron, they dominate the jet power,
but they could be unimportant if the emission is due to electron-positron
pairs. In this case the total jet power could be much smaller. However, if the
gamma-ray flux is due to inverse Compton scattering with seed photons produced
outside the jet, the radiation is anisotropic also in the comoving frame,
making the jet to recoil. This Compton rocket effect is strong for light,
electron-positron jets, and negligible for heavy, proton dominated jets. No
significant deceleration, required by fast superluminal motion, requires a
minimum number of protons per lepton, and thus a minimum jet power. We apply
these ideas to the blazar 3C 454.3, to find a robust lower limit to its total
jet power: if the viewing angle theta_v ~ 1/Gamma the jet power is larger than
the accretion luminosity L_d for any bulk Lorentz factor Gamma. For theta_v =0,
instead, the minimum jet power can be smaller than L_d for Gamma<25. No more

Sgr A* is continuously emitting and continuously variable in the near-infrared,

distribution can be described by a lognormal distribution at low intrinsic

median flux of approximately 1.1 mJy, but above 5 mJy the flux distribution is
significantly flatter (high flux events are more common) than expected for the
extrapolation of the lognormal distribution to high fluxes. We make a general
identification of the low level emission above 5 mJy as flaring emission and of
the low level emission as the quiescent state. We also report here the
brightest Ks-band flare ever observed (from August 5th, 2008) which reached an

protons can readily consume H from the surface of neutron stars (NSs) during
their early cooling history. In the absence of subsequent accretion, it will be
depleted from the photosphere. We now extend diffusive nuclear burning to He,
motivated by the recent observation by Ho \& Heinke of a carbon atmosphere on
the NS in the Cassiopeia A supernova remnant. We calculate the equilibrium
structure of He on an underlying $\alpha$ capturing material, accounting for
thermal, mass defect, and Coulomb corrections on the stratification of material
with the same zeroth order $\mu_e = A/Z$. We show that Coulomb corrections
dominate over thermal and mass defect corrections in the highly degenerate part
of the envelope. We also show that the bulk of the He sits deep in the envelope
rather than near the surface. Thus, even if the photospheric He abundance is
low, the total He column could be substantially larger than the photospheric
column, which may have implications for rapid surface evolution ($\approx 1$ yr
timescales) of neutron stars. When nuclear reactions are taken into account, we
find that for base temperatures $\gtrsim 1.6 \times 10^8$ K, He is readily
captured onto C. As these high temperatures are present during the early stages
of NS evolution, we expect that the primordial He is completely depleted from
the NS surface like the case for primordial H. We also find that magnetic
fields $\lesssim 10^{12}$ G do not affect our conclusions. Armed with the
results of this work and our prior efforts, we expect that primordial H and He
are depleted, and so any observed H or He on the surfaces of these NS must be
due to subsequent accretion (with or without spallation). If this subsequent
accretion can be prevented, the underlying mid-Z material would be exposed.

number, global atmospheric simulations with only axisymmetric forcing pass from
an Earth-like atmosphere to a superrotating atmosphere that more resembles the
atmospheres of Venus or Titan. The transition to superrotation occurs under
conditions in which equatorward-propagating Rossby waves generated by
baroclinic instability at intermediate and high latitudes are suppressed, which
will occur when the deformation radius exceeds the planetary radius. At large
thermal Rossby numbers following an initial, nearly axisymmetric phase, a
global baroclinic wave of zonal wavenumber one generated by mixed
barotropic-baroclinic instability dominates the eddy flux of zonal momentum.
The global wave converges eastward zonal momentum to the equator and deposits
westward momentum at intermediate latitudes during spinup and before
superrotation emerges, and the baroclinic instability ceases once superrotation
is established. A global barotropic mode of zonal wavenumber one generated by a
mix of high- and low-latitude barotropic instability is responsible for
maintaining superrotation in the statistically steady state. At intermediate
thermal Rossby numbers, momentum flux by the global baroclinic mode is
subdominant relative to smaller baroclinic modes, and thus strong superrotation
does not develop.

the spectral energy distribution (SEDs) of galaxies from the ultraviolet to
far-infrared to a small pilot sample of purely star-forming Ultra-Luminous
Infrared Galaxies (ULIRGs). We interpret the observed SEDs of 16 ULIRGs using
this physically-motivated model which accounts for the emission of stellar
populations from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared and for the attenuation
by dust in two components: an optically-thick starburst component and the
diffuse ISM. The infrared emission is computed by assuming that all the energy
absorbed by dust in these components is re-radiated at mid- and far-infrared
wavelengths. This model allows us to derive statistically physical properties
including star formation rates, stellar masses, as well as temperatures and
masses of different dust components and plausible star formation histories. We
find that, although the ultraviolet to near-infrared emission represents only a
small fraction of the total power radiated by ULIRGs, observations in this
wavelength range are important to understand the properties of the stellar
populations and dust attenuation in the diffuse ISM of these galaxies.
Furthermore, our analysis indicates that the use of mid-infrared spectroscopy
from the Infrared Spectrograph on the Spitzer Space Telescope is crucial to
obtain realistic estimates of the extinction to the central energy source,
mainly via the depth of the 9.7-micron silicate feature, and thus accurately
constrain the total energy balance. Our findings are consistent with the notion
that, in the local Universe, the physical properties of ULIRGs are
fundamentally different from those of galaxies with lower infrared luminosities
and that local ULIRGs are the result of merger-induced starbursts. [abridged]

three orthogonal dimensions - the number of seed nodes activated at the
beginning (known as budget), the expected number of activated nodes at the end
of the propagation (known as expected spread or coverage), and the time taken
for the propagation. We can constrain one or two of these and try to optimize
the third. In their seminal paper, Kempe et al. constrained the budget, left
time unconstrained, and maximized the coverage: this problem is known as
Influence Maximization.
  In this paper, we study alternative optimization problems which are naturally
motivated by resource and time constraints on viral marketing campaigns. In the
first problem, termed Minimum Target Set Selection (or MINTSS for short), a
coverage threshold n is given and the task is to find the minimum size seed set
such that by activating it, at least n nodes are eventually activated in the
expected sense. In the second problem, termed MINTIME, a coverage threshold n
and a budget threshold k are given, and the task is to find a seed set of size
at most k such that by activating it, at least n nodes are activated, in the
minimum possible time. Both these problems are NP-hard, which motivates our
interest in their approximation.
  For MINTSS, we develop a simple greedy algorithm and show that it provides a
bicriteria approximation. We also establish a generic hardness result
suggesting that improving it is likely to be hard. For MINTIME, we show that
even bicriteria and tricriteria approximations are hard under several
conditions. However, if we allow the budget to be boosted by a logarithmic
factor and allow the coverage to fall short, then the problem can be solved
exactly in PTIME.
  Finally, we show the value of the approximation algorithms, by comparing them
against various heuristics.

source coding and rate-constrained simulation. The code structure has intuitive
similarities to classic random coding arguments as well as to ``fake process''
methods and alphabet-constrained methods. Experimental evidence shows that the
approach provides comparable or superior performance in comparison with
previously published methods on common examples, sometimes by significant
margins.

coalescence of a massive black hole (MBH) binary imparts a velocity ""kick"" to
the system that can displace the hole from the center of its host. Here we
study the trajectories and observability of MBHs recoiling in three (one major,
two minor) gas-rich galaxy merger remnants that were previously simulated at
high resolution, and in which the pairing of the MBHs had been shown to be
successful. We run new simulations of MBHs recoiling in the major merger
remnant with Mach numbers in the range 1<M<6, and use simulation data to
construct a semi-analytical model for the orbital evolution of MBHs in gas-rich
systems. We show that: 1) in major merger remnants the energy deposited by the
moving hole into the rotationally supported, turbulent medium makes a
negligible contribution to the thermodynamics of the gas. This contribution
becomes significant in minor merger remnants, potentially allowing for an
electromagnetic signature of MBH recoil; 2) in major merger remnants, the
combination of both deeper central potential well and drag from high-density
gas confines even MBHs with kick velocities as high as 1200 km/s within 1 kpc
from the host's center; 3) kinematically offset nuclei may be observable for
timescales of a few Myr in major merger remnants in the case of recoil
velocities in the range 700-1,000 km/s; 4) in minor mergers remnants the effect
of gas drag is weaker, and MBHs with recoil speeds in the range 300-600 km/s
will wander through the host halo for longer timescales. When accounting for
the probability distribution of kick velocities, however, we find that the
likelihood of observing recoiling MBHs in gas-rich galaxy mergers is very low,
typically below 10^-5 - 10^-6.

regularization to the solution. To speed up the computation, a multi-grid
method is employed. Our GPU implementation has achieved high computational
efficiency and a CBCT image of resolution 512\times512\times70 can be
reconstructed in ~5 min. We have tested our algorithm on a digital NCAT phantom
and a physical Catphan phantom. It is found that our TF-based algorithm is able
to reconstrct CBCT in the context of undersampling and low mAs levels. We have
also quantitatively analyzed the reconstructed CBCT image quality in terms of
modulation-transfer-function and contrast-to-noise ratio under various scanning

TF algorithm. Moreover, our algorithm has also been validated in a real

employed in describing properties of octet baryons and their interactions.
Magnetic moments of octet baryons are found to increase non-negligibly as
density and temperature increase, and we find that temperature dependence can
be strongly correlated with the quark-hadron phase transition. Model dependence
is also examined by comparing the results from the quark-meson coupling (QMC)
model to those by the modified QMC (MQMC) model where the bag constant is
assumed to depend on density. Both models predict sizable dependence on density
and temperature, but the MQMC model shows a more drastic change of magnetic

also reported in the given models.

of discrete-time stationary channels with continuous input, under the
constraint of vanishing input amplitude or power. The approximation describes
the input by its covariance matrix, while the channel properties are described
by the Fisher information matrix. This separation of input and channel
properties allows us to analyze the optimality conditions in a convenient way.
We show that input correlations in memoryless channels do not affect channel
capacity since their effect decreases fast with vanishing input amplitude or
power. On the other hand, for channels with memory, properly matching the input
covariances to the dependence structure of the noise may lead to almost
noiseless information transfer, even for intermediate values of the noise
correlations. Since many model systems described in mathematical neuroscience
and biophysics operate in the high noise regime and weak-signal conditions, we
believe, that the described results are of potential interest also to

important mechanism for driving angular momentum transport in disks. We aim to
understand this instability in an approximate three-dimensional disk model
environment which we assume to be a single homentropic annular layer we analyze
using disk shallow-water theory. We consider the normal mode stability analysis
of two kinds of radial profiles of the mean potential vorticity: The first type
is a single step and the second kind is a symmetrical step of finite width
describing either a localized depression or peak of the mean potential
vorticity. For single potential vorticity steps we find there is no
instability. There is no instability when the symmetric step is a localized
peak. However, the Rossby wave instability occurs when the symmetrical step
profile is a depression, which, in turn, corresponds to localized peaks in the
mean enthalpy profile. This is in qualitative agreement with previous
two-dimensional investigations of the instability. For all potential vorticity
depressions, instability occurs for regions narrower than some maximum radial
length scale. We interpret the instability as resulting from the interaction of
at least two Rossby edgewaves. We identify the Rossby wave instability in the

formalism of quantum field theory can adequately describe neutrino oscillations
if correct physics conditions are imposed. This includes space-time
localization of the neutrino production and detection processes. Space-time
diagrams are introduced, which characterize this localization and illustrate
the coherence issues of neutrino oscillations. We discuss two approaches to
calculations of the transition amplitudes, which allow different physics
interpretations: (i) using configuration-space wave packets for the involved
particles, which leads to approximate conservation laws for their mean energies
and momenta; (ii) calculating first a plane-wave amplitude of the process,
which exhibits exact energy-momentum conservation, and then convoluting it with
the momentum-space wave packets of the involved particles. We show that these
two approaches are equivalent. Kinematic entanglement (which is invoked to
ensure exact energy-momentum conservation in neutrino oscillations) and
subsequent disentanglement of the neutrinos and recoiling states are in fact
irrelevant when the wave packets are considered. We demonstrate that the
contribution of the recoil particle to the oscillation phase is negligible
provided that the coherence conditions for neutrino production and detection
are satisfied. Unlike in the previous situation, the phases of both neutrinos
from $Z^0$ decay are important, leading to a realization of the
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox.

evolved from the unconfirmed magnetic state. High pressure X-ray absorption

valence plays an important role in suppressing the superconductivity and tuning
the transition from the unconfirmed magnetic state to a FM state. The unusual

shown the superparamagnetic behavior of these nanoparticles where the blocking

have identified the nature of this interaction to be of dipolar type, and show
that its strength decreases with the increasing particle size. The effect of
this dipolar interaction on magnetic properties is intriguing as the compounds
exhibit crossover from de Almeida-Thouless to Gabay-Toulouse like critical
lines on field-temperature plane above their respective interaction field. In
agreement with theoretical prediction, we infer that this crossover is induced

  Astrophysics",,,,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Studying molecular gas properties in merging galaxies gives important clues
to the onset and evolution of interaction-triggered starbursts. The CO/13CO 1-0
line intensity ratio can be used as a tracer of how dynamics and star formation
processes impact the gas properties. The Medusa (NGC~4194) merger is
particularly interesting to study since its LFIR/LCO ratio rivals that of
ultraluminous galaxies (ULIRGs), despite the comparatively modest luminosity,
indicating an exceptionally high star formation efficiency (SFE) in the Medusa
merger.
  Interferometric OVRO observations of CO and 13CO 1-0 in the Medusa show the
CO/13CO intensity ratio increases from normal, quiescent values (7-10) in the
outer parts (r>2 kpc) of the galaxy to high (16 to >40) values in the central
(r<1 kpc) starburst region. In the centre there is an east-west gradient where
the line ratio changes by more than a factor of three over 5"" (945 pc). The
integrated 13CO emission peaks in the north-western starburst region while the
central CO emission is strongly associated with the prominent crossing
dust-lane. We discuss the central east-west gradient in the context of gas
properties in the starburst and the central dust lane. We suggest that the
central gradient is mainly caused by diffuse gas in the dust lane. In this
scenario, the actual molecular mass distribution is better traced by the 13CO
1-0 emission than the CO. The possibilities of temperature and abundance
gradients are also discussed. We compare the central gas properties of the
Medusa to those of other minor mergers and suggest that the extreme and
transient phase of the Medusa star formation activity has similar traits to
those of high-redshift galaxies.

of CO in Hale-Bopp's coma from millimeter interferometric data and a
re-analysis of the IR lines.
  Simultaneous observations of the CO J(1-0) (115 GHz) and J(2-1) (230 GHz)
lines were undertaken with the IRAM interferometer in single-dish and
interferometric modes. The diversity of angular resolutions (from 1700 to 42000
km diameter at the comet) is suitable to study the radial distribution of CO
and detect the extended source observed in the infrared. We used excitation and
radiative transfer models to simulate the observations. Various CO density
distributions were considered, including 3D time-dependent hydrodynamical
simulations which reproduce a CO rotating jet. The CO J(1-0) and J(2-1)
observations can be consistently explained by a nuclear production of CO.
Composite 50:50 nuclear/extended productions with characteristic scale lengths
of CO parent L_p > 1500 km are rejected.
  Based on similar radiation transfer calculations, we show that the CO v = 1-0
ro-vibrational lines observed in comet Hale-Bopp at heliocentric distances less
than 1.5 AU are severely optically thick. The broad extent of the CO brightness
distribution in the infrared is mainly due to optical depth effects. Additional
factors can be found in the complex structure of the CO coma, and non-ideal
slit positioning caused by the anisotropy of dust IR emission.
  We conclude that both CO millimeter and infrared lines do not provide
compelling evidence for a distributed source of CO in Hale-Bopp's atmosphere.

disagreed by 5-10% (i.e. at 6-25 sigma level) which indicates a similar level
of uncertainty in the normalisations of the effective areas of these

observers and theorists to review the latest results. The purpose of the
workshop was to address the following issues: what are the main modes of
triggering extreme starbursts in the local Universe? How efficiently are stars
formed in extreme starbursts? What are the star formation histories of local
starburst galaxies? How well do the theoretical simulations model the
observations? What can we learn about starbursts in the distant Universe
through studies of their local counterparts? How important is the role of
extreme starbursts in the hierarchical assembly of galaxies? How are extreme
starbursts related to the triggering of AGN in the nuclei of galaxies? Overall,
41 talks and 4 posters with their corresponding 10 minutes short talks were
presented during the workshop. In addition, the workshop was designed with
emphasis on discussions, and therefore, there were 6 discussion sessions of up
to one hour during the workshop. Here is presented a summary of the purposes of

indeed ground axiomatizable when there is no action that exhibits both a
covariant and a contravariant behaviour, but becomes non-axiomatizable whenever
we have together actions of that kind and either covariant or contravariant

continuum at low metallicities. At low nebular densities both are shown to be
enhanced proportionally to the mean energy carried by the Lyman continuum
photons emitted by the ionizing source. Larger Ly alpha equivalent widths are
therefore predicted at low metallicity. The HeII 1640 A line can be weaker than
case B predicts (in terms of flux as well as the equivalent width) due to its
ionization parameter dependence and to the enhanced underlying two-photon
continuum. Our results have implications for the interpretation of star-forming
metal-poor and/or high redshift galaxies, for galaxies among the Ly alpha
emitters (LAE) and Lyman Break galaxy (LBG) populations, and for searches of
Population III stars in the distant Universe.

from CRs illuminating the ISM of our Galaxy through the processes of
Bremsstrahlung, pion production and decay, and inverse-Compton scattering. The
study of this diffuse emission provides insight into the origin and transport
of CRs. We searched for gamma-ray emission from the SMC in order to derive
constraints on the CR population and transport in an external system with
properties different from the Milky Way. We analysed the first 17 months of
continuous all-sky observations by the Large Area Telescope of the Fermi
mission to determine the spatial distribution, flux and spectrum of the
gamma-ray emission from the SMC. We also used past radio synchrotron
observations of the SMC to study the population of CR electrons specifically.
We obtained the first detection of the SMC in high-energy gamma rays, with an
integrated >100MeV flux of (3.7 +/-0.7) x10e-8 ph/cm2/s, with additional
systematic uncertainty of <16%. The emission is steady and from an extended
source ~3{\deg} in size. It is not clearly correlated with the distribution of
massive stars or neutral gas, nor with known pulsars or SNRs, but a certain
correlation with supergiant shells is observed. The observed flux implies an
upper limit on the average CR nuclei density in the SMC of ~15% of the value
measured locally in the Milky Way. The population of high-energy pulsars of the
SMC may account for a substantial fraction of the gamma-ray flux, which would
make the inferred CR nuclei density even lower. The average density of CR
electrons derived from radio synchrotron observations is consistent with the
same reduction factor but the uncertainties are large. From our current
knowledge of the SMC, such a low CR density does not seem to be due to a lower
rate of CR injection and rather indicates a smaller CR confinement volume
characteristic size.

millisecond periods (i.e. recycling) via mass accretion from their donor stars,
and they are the descendants of neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries. However,
some studies indicate that the formation of pulsars from the accretion-induced
collapse (AIC) of accreting white dwarfs (WDs) cannot be excluded. In this
work, we use a population synthesis code to examine if the AIC channel can
produce eccentric binary millisecond pulsars (BMSPs) in the Galaxy. Our
simulated results indicate that, only when the natal MSPs receive a relatively
strong kick ($\ga100\rm km\,s^{-1}$), can the AIC channel produce $\sim 10-180$
eccentric ($e>0.1$) BMSPs in the Galaxy, most of which are accompanied by a
Helium star. Such a kick seems to be highly unlikely in the conventional AIC
process, hence the probability of forming eccentric BMSPs via the AIC channel
can be ruled out. Even if a high kick is allowed, the AIC channel cannot
produce eccentric BMSPs with an orbital period of $\ga 20$ days. Therefore, we
propose that the peculiar BMSP PSR J1903+0327 cannot be formed by the AIC
channel. However, the AIC evolutionary channel may produce some fraction of
isolated millisecond pulsars, and even sub-millisecond pulsars if they really
exist.

The plasma beta surface as well as the surface optical depth unity are very
corrugated. At the borders of intraspines and inside, the magnetic field is not
force-free at deeper layers and nearly force free at the top layers. The
magnetic field of the spines is close to being potential everywhere. The

properties to charge transfer instabilities and competition between insulating
A-AFI phase and metallic-like dynamically disproportionated phase formally
separated by a first-order phase transition at T_{disp}=T_{JT}\approx 750 K.
The unconventional high-temperature phase is addressed to be a specific
electron-hole Bose liquid (EHBL) rather than a simple ""chemically""
disproportionated R(Mn^{2+}Mn^{4+})O_3 phase. New phase does nucleate as a
result of the charge transfer (CT) instability and evolves from the
self-trapped CT excitons, or specific EH-dimers, which seem to be a precursor
of both insulating and metallic-like ferromagnetic phases observed in
manganites. We arrive at highly frustrated system of triplet (e_g^2)^3A_{2g}
bosons moving in a lattice formed by hole Mn^{4+} centers. Starting with
different experimental data we have reproduced a typical temperature dependence
of the volume fraction of high-temperature mixed-valent EHBL phase. We argue
that a slight nonisovalent substitution, photo-irradiation, external pressure
or magnetic field gives rise to an electronic phase separation with a
nucleation or an overgrowth of EH-droplets. Such a scenario provides a
comprehensive explanation of numerous puzzling properties observed in parent

  Discrete Algorithms (SoDA 2010)",,,,"cs.DM cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Consider a routing problem consisting of a demand graph H and a supply graph
G. If the pair obeys the cut condition, then the flow-cut gap for this instance
is the minimum value C such that there is a feasible multiflow for H if each
edge of G is given capacity C. The flow-cut gap can be greater than 1 even when
G is the (series-parallel) graph K_{2,3}. In this paper we are primarily
interested in the ""integer"" flow-cut gap. What is the minimum value C such that
there is a feasible integer valued multiflow for H if each edge of G is given
capacity C? We conjecture that the integer flow-cut gap is quantitatively
related to the fractional flow-cut gap. This strengthens the well-known
conjecture that the flow-cut gap in planar and minor-free graphs is O(1) to
suggest that the integer flow-cut gap is O(1). We give several results on
non-trivial special classes of graphs supporting this conjecture and further
explore the ""primal"" method for understanding flow-cut gaps. Our results
include:
  - Let G be obtained by series-parallel operations starting from an edge st,
and consider orienting all edges in G in the direction from s to t. A demand is
compliant if its endpoints are joined by a directed path in the resulting
oriented graph. If the cut condition holds for a compliant instance and G+H is
Eulerian, then an integral routing of H exists.
  - The integer flow-cut gap in series-parallel graphs is 5. We also give an
explicit class of instances that shows via elementary calculations that the
flow-cut gap in series-parallel graphs is at least 2-o(1); this simplifies the
proof by Lee and Raghavendra.
  - The integer flow-cut gap in k-Outerplanar graphs is c^{O(k)} for some fixed
constant c.
  - A simple proof that the flow-cut gap is O(\log k^*) where k^* is the size
of a node-cover in H; this was previously shown by G\""unl\""uk via a more
intricate proof.

multi-dimensional crystalline solids modeled by many-body potentials remains a
challenge. The original quasicontinuum energy (QCE) has been implemented for
many-body potentials in two and three space dimensions, but it is not patch
test consistent. We propose that by blending the atomistic and corresponding
Cauchy-Born continuum models of QCE in an interfacial region with thickness of
a small number $k$ of blended atoms, a general quasicontinuum energy (BQCE) can
be developed with the potential to significantly improve the accuracy of QCE
near lattice instabilities such as dislocation formation and motion. In this
paper, we give an error analysis of the blended quasicontinuum energy (BQCE)
for a periodic one-dimensional chain of atoms with next-nearest neighbor
interactions. Our analysis includes the optimization of the blending function
for an improved convergence rate. We show that the $\ell^2$ strain error for
the non-blended QCE energy (QCE), which has low order
$\text{O}(\epsilon^{1/2})$ where $\epsilon$ is the atomistic length scale, can
be reduced by a factor of $k^{3/2}$ for an optimized blending function where
$k$ is the number of atoms in the blending region. The QCE energy has been
further shown to suffer from a O$(1)$ error in the critical strain at which the
lattice loses stability. We prove that the error in the critical strain of BQCE
can be reduced by a factor of $k^2$ for an optimized blending function, thus
demonstrating that the BQCE energy for an optimized blending function has the
potential to give an accurate approximation of the deformation near lattice
instabilities such as crack growth.

megamaser galaxies, plus a seventh previously published, to determine accurate
enclosed masses within the central $\sim0.3$ pc of these galaxies, smaller than
the radius of the sphere of influence of the central mass in all cases. We also
set lower limits to the central mass densities of between 0.12 and 60 $\times
10^{10} M_{\odot}$~pc$^{-3}$. For six of the seven disks, the high central
densities rule out clusters of stars or stellar remnants as the central
objects, and this result further supports our assumption that the enclosed mass
can be attributed predominantly to a supermassive black hole. The seven BHs
have masses ranging between 0.76 and 6.5$\times$10$^7 M_{\odot}$. The BH mass
errors are $\approx11$\%, dominated by the uncertainty of the Hubble constant.
We compare the megamaser BH mass determination with other BH mass measurement
techniques. The BH mass based on virial estimation in four galaxies is
consistent with the megamaser BH mass given the latest empirical value of
$\langle f \rangle$, but the virial mass uncertainty is much greater. MCP
observations continue and we expect to obtain more maser BH masses in the

generated by powers of general linear forms $L_{i}$. Our approach is via the

reduction to a smaller projective space. When $r=4$ we give an almost complete
description of when such ideals have the WLP, leaving open only one case. When
$r=5$ we solve the problem when $a_1 = \cdots = a_5 \leq a_6$. When $r \geq 6$
is even we solve the problem for uniform powers $a_1 = \cdots = a_{r+1} = d$;
an asympotic version of this latter result was proven by Harbourne, Schenck and

analyzed, most notably when $r=7$, and we end up with a conjecture which says

semileptonic b-hadron decays by the D0 Collaboration is about 3 sigmas away
from the standard-model prediction, hinting at the presence of CP-violating new
physics in the mixing of B_s mesons. We consider the possibility that this
anomalous result arises from the contribution of a light spin-1 particle.
Taking into account various experimental constraints, we find that the effect
of such a particle with mass below the b-quark mass can yield a prediction
consistent with the anomalous D0 measurement within its one-sigma range.

points where a given set of (more than 2) mappings agree. On manifolds, this
theory is interesting only for maps between spaces of different dimension, and
our results hold for sets of k maps on compact manifolds from dimension (k-1)n
to dimension n. We define the Nielsen equalizer number, which is a lower bound
for the minimal number of equalizer points when the maps are changed by
homotopies, and is in fact equal to this minimal number when the domain
manifold is not a surface.
  As an application we give some results in Nielsen coincidence theory with
positive codimension. This includes a complete computation of the geometric
Nielsen number for maps between tori.

Hilbertian formal axiomatic method developed later in the 19th century. However
such an anachronistic approach fails to provide a sound reading of
Lobachevsky's geometrical works. Although the modern notion of model of a given
theory has a counterpart in Lobachevsky's writings its role in Lobachevsky's
geometrical theory turns to be very unusual. Lobachevsky doesn't consider
various models of Hyperbolic geometry, as the modern reader would expect, but
uses a non-standard model of Euclidean plane (as a particular surface in the
Hyperbolic 3-space). In this paper I consider this Lobachevsky's construction,
and show how it can be better analyzed within an alternative non-Hilbertian
foundational framework, which relates the history of geometry of the 19th
century to some recent developments in the field.

symmetry. Because MKSA units (S.I. units) have no essential meaning, we should
use the units where c^2=epsilon^2=h^2=1. When volume is negative in the
left-handed coordinates as written in the Maxwell's text book, epsilon is also
negative in the left-handed coordinates. Thus, we need to have negative values
of the universal constants. If their absolute value is unity, the light
velocity is a time-reversal operator, permitivity is a space-reversal operator,
and the Plank constant is an operator for wave-particle transformation. This
paper shows new concepts in fundamental physics although it was written for
nonspecialists.
