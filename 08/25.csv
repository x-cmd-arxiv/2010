T2K (Tokaito-Kamioka) long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment. The muon
monitor consists of two types of detector arrays: ionization chambers and
silicon PIN photodiodes. It measures the intensity and profile of muons
produced, along with neutrinos, in the decay of pions. The measurement is
sensitive to the intensity and direction of the neutrino beam. The linearity
and stability of the detectors were measured in beam tests to be within 2.4%
and 1.5%, respectively. Based on the test results, the precision of the beam
direction measured by the muon monitor is expected to be 0.25 mrad.

a geometric interpretation in terms of Hilbert space projections: For a two

the dephasing, the dissipative and non-dissipative parts of the response are
linked to a metric and to a symplectic form. The metric is the Fubini-Study

symplectic structures are compatible the non-dissipative part of the inverse

three examples of physical systems whose quantum states induce compatible

Instead, an extension of Noether's theorem reduces the equations of motion to
evolutionary laws that prove useful, even if the transformations are not
generalized symmetries of the equations of motion. In the case of scaling,
symmetry leads to a scaling evolutionary law, a first-order equation in terms
of scale invariants, linearly relating kinematic and dynamic degrees of
freedom.
  This scaling evolutionary law appears in dynamical and in static systems.
Applied to dynamical central-force systems, the scaling evolutionary equation
leads to generalized virial laws, which linearly connect the kinetic and
potential energies. Applied to barotropic hydrostatic spheres, the scaling
evolutionary equation linearly connects the gravitational and internal energy
densities. This implies well-known properties of polytropes, describing
degenerate stars and chemically homogeneous non-degenerate stellar cores.

survey of FUors using XMM-Newton to determine their X-ray properties, about

detected. The X-ray spectrum of FU Ori was found to be unusual, consisting of a
cool moderately-absorbed component plus a hotter component viewed through an
absorption column density that is an order of magnitude higher. We present here
a sensitive (99 ks) follow-up X-ray observation of FU Ori obtained at higher
angular resolution with Chandra ACIS-S. The unusual multi-component spectrum is
confirmed. The hot component is centered on FU Ori and dominates the emission
above 2 keV. It is variable (a signature of magnetic activity) and is probably
coronal emission originating close to FU Ori's surface viewed through cool gas
in FU Ori's strong wind or accretion stream. In contrast, the X-ray centroid of
the soft emission below 2 keV is offset 0.20 arcsec to the southeast of FU Ori,
toward the near-IR companion (FU Ori S). This offset amounts to slightly less
than half the separation between the two stars. The most likely explanation for
the offset is that the companion contributes significantly to the softer X-ray
emission below 2 keV (and weakly above 2 keV). The superimposed X-ray
contributions from FU Ori and the companion resolve the paradox posed by
XMM-Newton of an apparently single X-ray source viewed through two different
absorption columns.

theme in quantum optics. When placed in highly confined optical fields, such as
those created in optical cavities or plasmonic structures, the optical
properties of the emitter can change drastically. In particular, photonic
crystal (PC) cavities show high quality factors combined with an extremely
small mode volume. Efficiently coupling a single quantum emitter to a PC cavity
is challenging because of the required positioning accuracy. Here, we
demonstrate deterministic coupling of single Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centers to
high-quality gallium phosphide PC cavities, by deterministically positioning
their 50 nm-sized host nanocrystals into the cavity mode maximum with
few-nanometer accuracy. The coupling results in a 25-fold enhancement of NV
center emission at the cavity wavelength. With this technique, the NV center
photoluminescence spectrum can be reshaped allowing for efficient generation of
coherent photons, providing new opportunities for quantum science.

all luminous structure in the universe, and their properties comprise an
essential part of the current cosmological model. I review the internal
properties of dark matter halos, focussing on the simple, universal trends
predicted by numerical simulations of structure formation. Simulations indicate
that halos should all have roughly the same spherically-averaged density
profile and kinematic structure, and predict simple distributions of shape,
formation history and substructure in density and kinematics, over an enormous
range of halo mass and for all common variants of the concordance cosmology. I
describe observational progress towards testing these predictions by measuring
masses, shapes, profiles and substructure in real halos, using baryonic tracers
or gravitational lensing. An important property of simulated halos (possibly
the most important property) is their dynamical 'age', or degree of internal
relaxation. The age of a halo may have almost as much effect as its mass in
determining the state of its baryonic contents, so halo ages are also worth
trying to measure observationally. I review recent gravitational lensing
studies of galaxy clusters which should measure substructure and relaxation in
a large sample of individual cluster halos, producing quantitative measures of
age that are well-matched to theoretical predictions. The age distributions
inferred from these studies will lead to second-generation tests of the
cosmological model, as well as an improved understanding of cluster assembly

pressure and herding in social networks, and protocol selection in autonomous
ad-hoc sensor networks. By introducing a small noise term to the NG, the
resulting Markov Chain model called Noisy Naming Games (NNG) are ergodic, in
which all partial consensus states are recurrent. By using Gibbs-Markov
equivalence we show how to get the NNG's stationary distribution in terms of
the local specification of a related Markov Random Field (MRF). By ordering the
partially-synchronized states according to their Gibbs energy, taken here to be
a good measure of social tension, this method offers an enhanced method for
community-detection in social interaction data. We show how the lowest Gibbs
energy multi-name states separate and display the hidden community structures
within a social network.

evolves from a localized to a resonating valence-bond state. This spin-1/2
tetramer is created using the polarization states of four photons. The
single-particle addressability and tunable measurement-induced interactions
provide us insights into entanglement dynamics among individual particles. We

stage the array of vortices arises near a surface of the drop and induces a
non-monotonic spatial distribution of the temperature over the drop surface.
The number of near-surface vortices in the drop is controlled by the Marangoni

layers. The number of vortices quickly decreases with time, resulting in three
bulk vortices in the intermediate stage. The vortex structure finally evolves

At the host galaxy distance of 95 Mpc, the maximum observed 0.2 - 10 keV
luminosity is 1.2E42 erg/s. This luminosity is ~400 times above the Eddington
limit for a 20 Msun black hole, and has been interpreted as implying an
accreting intermediate mass black hole with a mass in excess of 500 Msun
(assuming the luminosity is a factor of 10 above the Eddington value). However,
a number of other ultra-luminous X-ray sources have been later identified as
background active galaxies or foreground sources. It has recently been claimed
that HLX-1 could be a quiescent neutron star X-ray binary at a Galactic
distance of only 2.5 kpc, so a definitive association with the host galaxy is
crucial in order to confirm the nature of the object. Here we report the
detection of the Halpha emission line for the recently identified optical
counterpart at a redshift consistent with that of ESO 243-49. This finding
definitively places HLX-1 inside ESO 243-49, confirming the extreme maximum
luminosity and strengthening the case for it containing an accreting
intermediate mass black hole of more than 500 Msun.

telescope 2 weeks prior to the peak, and then followed it up with telescopes
ranging in aperture from 10-cm to 6.5-m. Using early photometric data available
only from ASAS, we find that the SN is similar to the over-luminous Type Ia SN
1991T, with a peak at Mv=-19.6 mag, and a slow decline rate of Dm_15(B)=0.95
mag. The early post-maximum spectra closely resemble those of SN 1991T, while
the late time spectra are more similar to those of normal Type Ia SNe.
Interestingly, SN 2009nr has a projected distance of 13.0 kpc (~4.3 disk scale

indicates that the progenitor of SN 2009nr is not associated with a young

star formation. The pre-discovery observation of SN 2009nr using ASAS
demonstrates the science utility of high cadence all sky surveys conducted

the progenitors are compact star-forming galaxies, as expected at high
redshift. Their integrated spectral energy distributions and velocity
dispersions are in good agreement with the observations, and their position in
the (v_{maj}/sigma, ellipticity) diagram traces the upper envelope of the
distribution of lower redshift early-type galaxies. The simulated merger
remnants show time- and sightline-dependent M/L ratio gradients that result
from a superposition of radially dependent stellar age, stellar metallicity,
and extinction. The median ratio of effective radius in rest-frame V-band light
to that in mass surface density is ~ 2 during the quiescent remnant phase. This
is typically expressed by a negative color gradient (i.e., red core), which we
expect to correlate with the integrated color of the system. Finally, the
simulations differ from the observations in their surface brightness profile
shape. The simulated remnants are typically best fit by high (n >> 4) Sersic
indices, whereas observed quiescent galaxies at z ~ 2 tend to be less cuspy

producing an optically bright flare of radiation. We predict the spectra and
spectral evolution of tidal disruption events, focusing on the photoionized gas
outside this outflow's photosphere. The spectrum will show absorption lines
that are strongly blueshifted relative to the host galaxy, very broad

are a significant source of confusion in optical surveys for tidal disruption
events: we estimate that nuclear Type Ia supernovae are two orders of magnitude
more common than tidal disruption events at z ~ 0.1 for ground-based surveys.
Nuclear Type II supernovae occur at a comparable rate but can be excluded by
pre-selecting red galaxies. Supernova contamination can be reduced to a

Calabi-Yau fourfold is studied by lifting a three-dimensional M-theory
compactification. The lift is performed by using T-duality realized via a
Legendre transform on the level of the effective action, and the application of
vector-scalar duality in three dimensions. The leading order Kahler potential
and gauge-kinetic coupling functions are determined. In these compactifications
two sources of gauge theories are present. Space-time filling non-Abelian
seven-branes arise at the singularities of the elliptic fibration of the
fourfold. Their couplings are included by resolving the singular fourfold.
Generically a U(1)^r gauge theory arises from the R-R bulk sector if the base
of the elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau fourfold supports 2r harmonic
three-forms. The gauge coupling functions depend holomorphically on the complex
structure moduli of the fourfold, comprising closed and open string degrees of
freedom. The four-dimensional electro-magnetic duality is studied in the
three-dimensional effective theory obtained after M-theory compactification. A
discussion of matter couplings transforming in the adjoint of the seven-brane
gauge group is included.

atomic hydrogen is converted into molecules. There are currently two dominant
models for what property of the galactic disk determines its molecular
fraction: either hydrostatic pressure driven by the gravity of gas and stars,
or a combination of gas column density and metallicity. To assess the validity
of these models, we compare theoretical predictions to the observed atomic gas
content of low-metallicity dwarf galaxies with high stellar densities. The
extreme conditions found in these systems are optimal to distinguish the two
models, otherwise degenerate in nearby spirals. Locally, on scales <100 pc, we
find that the state of the interstellar medium is mostly sensitive to the gas
column density and metallicity rather than hydrostatic pressure. On larger
scales where the average stellar density is considerably lower, both pressure
and shielding models reproduce the observations, even at low metallicity. We
conclude that models based on gas and dust shielding more closely describe the
process of molecular formation, especially at the high resolution that can be
achieved in modern galaxy simulations or with future radio/millimeter arrays.

reliably to compute the effective potential for the Polyakov loop P in the

fields, which by themselves would lead to a deconfined phase at small L. In
order for the fermionic effects to dominate gauge field effects in the

indicates that chiral symmetry breaking effects are potentially important. We
develop a Polyakov-Nambu-Jona Lasinio (PNJL) model which combines the known
perturbative behavior of adjoint QCD models at small L with chiral symmetry
breaking effects to produce an effective potential for the Polyakov loop P and
the chiral order parameter psi-bar psi. A rich phase structure emerges from the

simulations of Cossu and D'Elia, which found no evidence for a direct
connection between the small-L and large-L confining regions. Nevertheless, the

the growth of seeds either by accreting mass from a circumnuclear disk and/or
by coalescences during merger episodes.
  The mass fraction of the disk captured by the central object and the related
timescale are still open questions, as well as how these quantities depend on
parameters like the initial mass of the disk or the seed or on the angular
momentum transport mechanism. This paper is addressed to these particular
aspects of the accretion disk evolution and of the growth of seeds.
  The time-dependent hydrodynamic equations were solved numerically for an
axi-symmetric disk in which the gravitational potential includes contributions
both from the central object and from the disk itself. The numerical code is
based on a Eulerian formalism, using a finite difference method of
second-order, according to the Van Leer upwind algorithm on a staggered mesh.
  The present simulations indicate that seeds capture about a half of the
initial disk mass, a result weakly dependent on model parameters. The
timescales required for accreting 50% of the disk mass are in the range 130-540
Myr, depending on the adopted parameters. These timescales permit to explain
the presence of bright quasars at z ~ 6.5. Moreover, at the end of the disk
evolution, a ""torus-like"" geometry develops, offering a natural explanation for
the presence of these structures in the central regions of AGNs, representing
an additional support to the unified model.

covered by observations is a good predictor of the quality of derived orbit
parameters. As eccentricity is positive definite, we find that eccentricities
of planets on nearly circular orbits are preferentially overestimated, with
typical bias of 1-2 times the median eccentricity uncertainty in a survey
(e.g., 0.04 in the Butler et al. 2006 catalog). When performing population
analysis, we recommend using the mode of the marginalized posterior
eccentricity distribution to minimize potential biases. While the Butler et al.
(2006) catalog reports eccentricities below 0.05 for just 17% of single-planet
systems, we estimate that the true fraction of e < 0.05 orbits is about
f(0.05)=38\pm 9%. For planets with P > 10 days, we find f(0.05)=28\pm 8% versus
10% from Butler et al. (2006). These planets either never acquired a large
eccentricity or were circularized following any significant eccentricity
excitation.

galaxies at redshift z=2.27 and z=3.54. Our version of GalICS has the chemical
evolution implemented in great detail and is less heavily reliant on
approximations such as instantaneous recycling. We vary the model parameters
controlling both the efficiency and redshift dependence of the SFR as well as
the efficiency of supernova feedback. We find that the factors controlling the
SFR influence the relation significantly at all redshifts and require a strong
redshift dependence, proportional to 1+z, in order to reproduce the observed
relation at the low mass end. Indeed, at any redshift, the predicted relation
flattens out at the high mass end resulting in a poorer agreement with
observations in this regime. We also find that variation of the parameters
associated with outflows has a minimal effect on the relation at high redshift
but does serve to alter its shape in the more recent past. We thus conclude
that the relation is one between SFR and mass and that outflows are only
important in shaping the relation at late times. When the relation is
stratified by SFR it is apparent that the predicted galaxies with increasing
stellar masses have higher SFRs, supporting the view that galaxy downsizing is
the origin of the relation. Attempting to reproduce the observed relation, we
vary the parameters controlling the efficiency of star formation and its
redshift dependence and compare the predicted relations with Erb et al. (2006)

governmental, and military networks. The intrinsically secure communications
graph (iS-graph) is a random graph which describes the connections that can be
securely established over a large-scale network, by exploiting the physical
properties of the wireless medium. This paper aims to characterize the global
properties of the iS-graph in terms of: (i) percolation on the infinite plane,
and (ii) full connectivity on a finite region. First, for the Poisson iS-graph
defined on the infinite plane, the existence of a phase transition is proven,
whereby an unbounded component of connected nodes suddenly arises as the
density of legitimate nodes is increased. This shows that long-range secure
communication is still possible in the presence of eavesdroppers. Second, full
connectivity on a finite region of the Poisson iS-graph is considered. The
exact asymptotic behavior of full connectivity in the limit of a large density
of legitimate nodes is characterized. Then, simple, explicit expressions are
derived in order to closely approximate the probability of full connectivity
for a finite density of legitimate nodes. The results help clarify how the
presence of eavesdroppers can compromise long-range secure communication.

are determined by means of W4 and post-W4 theories. For a set of 28 first- and
second-row diatomic molecules for which very accurate experimental
spectroscopic constants are available, W4 theory affords near-spectroscopic or
better predictions. Specifically, the root-mean-square deviations (RMSD) from
experiment are 0.04 pm for the equilibrium bond distances (r_e), 1.03 cm^{-1}
for the harmonic frequencies (\omega_e), 0.20 cm^{-1} for the first
anharmonicity constants (\omega_e x_e), 0.10 cm^{-1} for the second
anharmonicity constants (\omega_e y_e), and 0.001 cm^{-1} for the
vibration-rotation coupling constants (\alpha_e). Higher-order connected
triples, \hat{T}_3-(T), improve agreement with experiment for the hydride
systems, but their inclusion (in the absence of \hat{T}_4) tends to worsen
agreement with experiment for the nonhydride systems. Connected quadruple
excitations, \hat{T}_4, have significant and systematic effects on r_e,
\omega_e, and \omega_e x_e, in particular they universally increase r_e (by up
to 0.5 pm), universally reduce \omega_e (by up to 32 cm^{-1}), and universally
increase \omega_e x_e (by up to 1 cm^{-1}). Connected quintuple excitations,
\hat{T}_5, are spectroscopically significant for \omega_e of the nonhydride
systems, affecting \omega_e by up to 4 cm^{-1}. The triatomic molecules H_2O,
CO_2, and O_3, as well as the pathologically multireference BN and BeO
diatomics, are also considered. The asymmetric stretch of ozone represents a
severe challenge to W4 theory, in particular the connected quadruple
contribution converges very slowly with the basis set size. Finally, the
importance of post-CCSD(T) correlation effects for electrical properties,
namely dipole moments (\mu), polarizabilities (\alpha), and first
hyperpolarizabilities (\beta) is evaluated.

moving target in the airborne radar system. Due to the fast-changing clutter
scenario and/or non side-looking configuration, the stationarity of the
training data is destroyed such that the statistical-based methods suffer
performance degradation. Direct data domain (D3) methods avoid non-stationary
training data and can effectively suppress the clutter within the test cell.
However, this benefit comes at the cost of a reduced system degree of freedom
(DOF), which results in performance loss. In this paper, by exploiting the
intrinsic sparsity of the spectral distribution, a new direct data domain
approach using sparse representation (D3SR) is proposed, which seeks to
estimate the high-resolution space-time spectrum with only the test cell. The
simulation of both side-looking and non side-looking cases has illustrated the
effectiveness of the D3SR spectrum estimation using focal underdetermined
system solution (FOCUSS) and norm minimization. Then the clutter covariance
matrix (CCM) and the corresponding adaptive filter can be effectively obtained.
Since D3SR maintains the full system DOF, it can achieve better performance of
output signal-clutter-ratio (SCR) and minimum detectable velocity (MDV) than
current D3 methods, e.g., direct data domain least squares (D3LS). Thus D3SR is
more effective against the range-dependent clutter and interference in the
non-stationary clutter scenario.

However, most actual clutter scenarios appear only locally stationary and lack
sufficient IID training data. In this paper, by exploiting the intrinsic
sparsity of the clutter distribution in the angle-Doppler domain, a new STAP
algorithm called SR-STAP is proposed, which uses the technique of sparse
recovery to estimate the clutter space-time spectrum. Joint sparse recovery
with several training samples is also used to improve the estimation
performance. Finally, an effective clutter covariance matrix (CCM) estimate and
the corresponding STAP filter are designed based on the estimated clutter
spectrum. Both the Mountaintop data and simulated experiments have illustrated
the fast convergence rate of this approach. Moreover, SR-STAP is less dependent
on prior knowledge, so it is more robust to the mismatch in the prior knowledge
than knowledge-based STAP methods. Due to these advantages, SR-STAP has great
potential for application in actual clutter scenarios.

contrast to the Galactic BHBs. Here, we report a statistical X-ray spectral
study of 34 energy spectra from seven bright ULXs in the interacting galaxy
systems M51 and NGC4490/85, using archive data from multiple Chandra and
XMM-Newton observations spanning for a few years. In order to compare with
Galactic BHB states, we applied representative spectral models of BHBs; a
power-law (PL), a multi-color disk black body (MCD), and a slim disk model to
all the ULX spectra. We found a hint of a bimodal structure in the luminosity
distribution of the samples, suggesting that ULXs have two states with typical
luminosities of 3-6*10^{39} and 1.5-3*10^{39} ergs/s. Most spectra in the
brighter state are explained by the MCD or the slim disk model, whereas those
in the fainter state are explained by the PL model. In particular, the slim
disk model successfully explains the observed spectral variations of NGC4490/85
ULX-6 and ULX-8 by changes of the mass accretion rate to a black hole of an
estimated mass of <40 Msun. From the best-fit model parameters of each state,
we speculate that the brighter state in these two ULXs corresponds to the
brightest state of Galactic BHBs, which is often called the ``apparently
standard state''. The fainter state of the ULXs has a PL shaped spectrum, but
the photon index range is much wider than that seen in any single state of
Galactic BHBs. We thus speculate that it is a state unique to ULXs. Some
sources show much fainter and steeper spectra than the faint state, which we
identified as another state.

different grammars of the same language or different language versions. The key
element of the method is the operational, transformation-based representation
of those relationships. Given input grammars for convergence, they are
transformed until they are structurally equal. The transformations are composed
from primitive operators; properties of these operators and the composed chains
provide quantitative and qualitative insight into the relationships between the
grammars at hand. We describe a refined method for grammar convergence, and we
use it in a major study, where we recover the relationships between all the
grammars that occur in the different versions of the Java Language
Specification (JLS). The relationships are represented as grammar
transformation chains that capture all accidental or intended differences
between the JLS grammars. This method is mechanized and driven by nominal and
structural differences between pairs of grammars that are subject to
asymmetric, binary convergence steps. We present the underlying operator suite
for grammar transformation in detail, and we illustrate the suite with many
examples of transformations on the JLS grammars. We also describe the
extraction effort, which was needed to make the JLS grammars amenable to
automated processing. We include substantial metadata about the convergence
process for the JLS so that the effort becomes reproducible and transparent.

of spectral weight. Our results signify the importance of the vortex-like phase

beads between rapidly oscillating plates is investigated for various
oscillation frequencies by using the hybrid simulation of the molecular
dynamics and computational fluid dynamics. In the rapidly oscillating plates,
non-uniform boundary layer flows are generated over the plate due to inertia of
the fluid, and the local rheological properties of the melt are spatially
varied according to the local flow fields. Far from the plate, the local strain
decreases as the oscillation frequency increases such that the dynamic rheology
deviates from the linear moduli at the low oscillation frequencies rather than
high oscillation frequencies. On the contrary, near the plate, the local strain
rate increases with the oscillation frequency such that the shear thinning is
enhanced at high oscillation frequencies. In close vicinity to the plate, the
dynamic viscosity is mostly independent of the oscillation frequency, and the
shear thinning behavior becomes similar to that observed in steady shear flows.
Non-linear rheological properties are also investigated by the spectrum
analysis and the Lissajous-Bowditch curve. It is found that the fractional
amplitude of the higher harmonics to the linear harmonics is suppressed within
the boundary layer due to the non-slip boundary on the oscillating plate. We
also find that the melt exhibits inter-cycle shear thinning between different
positions but exhibits intra-cycle shear thickening at a fixed position in the
vicinity of the plate.

that the parameters of the linear Ogorodnikov-Milne model that describe the
kinematics of RGC stars in the zx plane do not differ significantly from zero.
The situation in the yz plane is different. For example, the component of the
solid-body rotation vector of the local solar neighborhood around the Galactic
x axis is M_32- = -2.6+/-0.2 km/s/kpc. Two parameters of the deformation tensor
in this plane, namely M_23^+ = 1.0+/-0.2 km/s/kpc and (M_33-M_22)= -1.3+/-0.4

of this structure) with an angular velocity (-3.1+/-0.5) < \Omega_W <

film geometry. Such systems involve two (or more) distinct correlation lengths
$\xi_\beta$ and $\xi_\alpha$ that scale as nontrivial powers of each other,
i.e.\ $\xi_\alpha\sim\xi_\beta^\theta$ with anisotropy index $\theta\ne 1$.
Thus two fundamental orientations, perpendicular ($\perp$) and parallel ($\|$),
for which the surface normal is oriented along an $\alpha$- and
$\beta$-direction, respectively, must be distinguished. The confinement of
critical fluctuations caused by the film's boundary planes is shown to induce
effective forces $\mathcal{F}_C$ that decay as
$\mathcal{F}_C\propto-(\partial/\partial
L)\Delta_{\perp,\|}\,L^{-\zeta_{\perp,\|}}$ as the film thickness $L$ becomes
large, where the proportionality constants involve nonuniversal amplitudes. The
decay exponents $\zeta_{\perp,\|}$ and the Casimir amplitudes
$\Delta_{\perp,\|}$ are universal but depend on the type of orientation. To
corroborate these findings, $n$-vector models with an $m$-axial bulk Lifshitz
point are investigated by means of RG methods below the upper critical
dimension $d^*(m)=4+m/2$ under various boundary conditions (BC). The exponents
$\zeta_{\perp,\|}$ are determined, and explicit results to one- or two-loop
order are presented for several Casimir amplitudes
$\Delta^{\mathrm{BC}}_{\perp,\|}$. The large-$n$ limits of the Casimir
amplitudes $\Delta_{\|}^{\mathrm{BC}}/n$ for periodic and Dirichlet BC are
shown to be proportional to their critical-point analogues at dimension
$d-m/2$. The limiting values
$\Delta^{\mathrm{PBC}}_{\|,\perp,\infty}=\lim_{n\to\infty}\Delta_{\|,\perp}^{\mathrm{PBC}}/n$
are determined exactly for the uniaxial cases $(d,m)=(3,1)$ under periodic BC.
Unlike $\Delta^{\mathrm{PBC}}_{\|,\infty}$,
$\Delta^{\mathrm{PBC}}_{\perp,\infty}$ is positive, so that the corresponding
Casimir force is repulsive.

reproduce in hierarchical galaxy formation models, particularly the
preponderance of wide systems. We investigate DLA kinematics at z=3 using
high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamical simulations that include a
heuristic model for galactic outflows. Without outflows, our simulations fail
to yield enough wide DLAs, as in previous studies. With outflows, predicted DLA
kinematics are in much better agreement with observations. Comparing two
outflow models, we find that a model based on momentum-driven wind scalings
provides the best match to the observed DLA kinematic statistics of Prochaska &
Wolfe. In this model, DLAs typically arise a few kpc away from galaxies that
would be identified in emission. Narrow DLAs can arise from any halo and galaxy
mass, but wide ones only arise in halos with mass >10^11 Mo, from either large
central or small satellite galaxies. This implies that the success of this
outflow model originates from being most efficient at pushing gas out from
small satellite galaxies living in larger halos. This increases the
cross-section for large halos relative to smaller ones, thereby yielding wider
kinematics. Our simulations do not include radiative transfer effects or
detailed metal tracking, and outflows are modeled heuristically, but they
strongly suggest that galactic outflows are central to understanding DLA
kinematics. An interesting consequence is that DLA kinematics may place
constraints on the nature and efficiency of gas ejection from high-z galaxies.

and the quantum relative entropy (QRE) between the state under examination and
a reference Gaussian state. We then evaluate the non-Gaussianities of several
families of non-Gaussian quantum states and show that the two measures have the
same basic properties and also share the same qualitative behaviour on most of
the examples taken into account. However, we also show that they introduce a
different relation of order, i.e. they are not strictly monotone each other. We
exploit the non-Gaussianity measures for states in order to introduce a measure
of non-Gaussianity for quantum operations, to assess Gaussification and
de-Gaussification protocols, and to investigate in details the role played by
non-Gaussianity in entanglement distillation protocols. Besides, we exploit the
QRE-based non-Gaussianity measure to provide new insight on the extremality of
Gaussian states for some entropic quantities such as conditional entropy,
mutual information and the Holevo bound. We also deal with parameter estimation
and present a theorem connecting the QRE nonG to the quantum Fisher
information. Finally, since evaluation of the QRE nonG measure requires the
knowledge of the full density matrix, we derive some {\em experimentally
friendly} lower bounds to nonG for some class of states and by considering the
possibility to perform on the states only certain efficient or inefficient
measurements.

molecular clouds that implies that these objects have approximately constant
column densities. This original claim, based upon millimeter observations of
carbon monoxide lines, has been challenged by many theorists, arguing that the
apparent constant column density observed is merely the result of the limited
dynamic range of observations, and that in reality clouds have column density
variations over two orders of magnitudes. In this letter we investigate a set
of nearby molecular clouds with near-infrared excess methods, which guarantee
very large dynamic ranges and robust column density measurements, to test the
validity of Larson's third law. We verify that different clouds have almost
identical average column densities above a given extinction threshold; this
holds regardless of the extinction threshold, but the actual average surface
mass density is a function of the specific threshold used. We show that a
second version of Larson's third law, involving the mass-radius relation for

  Galaxy Evolution","6 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in Astronomy &

evolving stellar phase densities may place useful constraints on the possible
history of the over-all galaxy population. We construct simple models for the
full stellar phase space distributions of galaxies' disk and spheroidal
components, and reproduce the well-known result that the maximum phase density
of an elliptical galaxy is too high to be produced collisionlessly from a disk
system, although we also show that the inclusion of a bulge component in the
disk removes this evolutionary impediment. In order to draw more general
conclusions about the evolution of the galaxy population, we use the Millennium
Galaxy Catalogue to construct a model of the entire phase density distribution
of stars in a representative sample of the local Universe. In such a composite
population, we show that the mixing inequality rules out some evolutionary
paths that are not prohibited by consideration of the maximum phase density
alone, and thus show that the massive ellipticals in this population could not
have formed purely from collisionless mergers of a low mass galaxy population
like that found in the local Universe. Although the violation of the mixing
inequality is in this case quite minor, and hence avoidable with a modest
amount of non-collisionless star formation in the merger process, it does
confirm the potential of this approach. The future measurement of stellar phase
densities at higher redshift will allow this potential to be fully exploited,
offering a new way to look at the possible pathways for galaxy evolution, and
to learn about the environment of star formation through the way that this
phase space becomes populated over time.

active galactic nuclei (AGN) in galaxies characterized by accretion disks,
radio jets, and nuclear outflows. Weaker masers, the kilomasers, seem to be
mostly related to star formation activity, although the possibility exists that
some of these sources may belong to the weak tail of the AGN maser
distribution. It is of particular importance to accurately locate the water
maser emission to reveal its origin and shed light onto extragalactic star
forming activity or to elucidate the highly obscured central regions of
galaxies. We performed interferometric observations of three galaxies, NGC3556,
Arp299, and NGC4151, where water emission was found. Statistical tools have
been used to study the relation between OH and water maser emission in
galaxies. The maser in NGC3556 is associated with a compact radio continuum
source that is most likely a supernova remnant or radio supernova. In Arp299,
the luminous water maser has been decomposed in three main emitting regions
associated with the nuclear regions of the two main galaxies of the system,
NGC3690 and IC694, and the region of overlap. In NGC4151, only one of the two
previously observed maser components has been tentatively detected. This
feature, if real, is associated with the galaxy's central region. The only
galaxy, so far, where luminous maser emission from two maser species, OH and
H2O has been confidently detected is Arp299. Weaker masers from these two
species do instead coexist in a number of objects. A larger number of objects
searched for both maser species are, however, necessary to better assess these
last two results.

The first magnetic fields in O- and B-type stars that do not belong
to the Bp-star class, have been discovered. The cyclic UV wind-line
variability, which has been observed in a significant fraction of early-type
stars, is likely to be related to such magnetic fields. Aims. We attempt to
improve our understanding of massive-star magnetic fields, and observe
twenty-five carefully-selected, OB-type stars. Methods. Of these stars we
obtain 136 magnetic field strength measurements. We present the UV wind-line
variability of all selected targets and summarise spectropolarimetric
observations acquired using the MUSICOS spectropolarimeter, mounted at the TBL,
Pic du Midi, between December 1998 and November 2004. From the average Stokes I
and V line profiles, derived using the LSD method, we measure the magnetic
field strengths, radial velocities, and first moment of the line profiles.
Results. No significant magnetic field is detected in any OB-type star that we
observed. Typical 1{\sigma} errors are between 15 and 200 G. A possible
magnetic-field detection for the O9V star 10 Lac remains uncertain, because the
field measurements depend critically on the fringe- effect correction in the
Stokes V spectra. We find excess emission in UV-wind lines, centred about the
rest wavelength, to be a new indirect indicator of the presence of a magnetic
field in early B-type stars. The most promising candidates to host magnetic
fields are the B-type stars {\delta} Cet and 6 Cep, and a number of O stars.
Conclusions. Although some O and B stars have strong dipolar field, which cause
periodic variability in the UV wind-lines, such strong fields are not
widespread. If the variability observed in the UV wind-lines of OB stars is
generally caused by surface magnetic fields, these fields are either weak
(<~few hundred G) or localised.

The evolution is followed until the formation of a hydrostatic protostar at the
center. In a lower-metallicity gas cloud, the temperature during the collapse
remains high owing to less efficient cooling. Using the temperature evolution
at the center as a function the density, we discuss the possibility of
fragmentation during the dust-cooling phase. The critical metallicity for the
fragmentation is 10^{-5}Z_sun assuming moderate elongation of the cloud cores
at the onset of this phase. From the density and velocity distributions at the
time of protostar formation, we evaluate the mass accretion rate in the
subsequent accretion phase. Using these accretion rates, we also calculate the
evolution of the protostars under the assumption of stationary accretion flow.
Finally, we discuss possible suppression of fragmentation by heating of the
ambient gas by protostellar radiation, which is considered important in the
contemporary star formation. We argue that it is negligible for <10^{-2}Zsun.

effect increases the survival probability of the dipoles, since color filtering

the opposite direction and is stronger, it makes the colliding nuclei more
opaque than in the case of pA collisions. As a result of parton saturation in

gluon density at small x. This in turn leads to a stronger transverse momentum
broadening in AA compared with pA collisions, i.e. to an additional growth of
the saturation momentum. Such a mutual boosting leads to a system of
reciprocity equations, which result in a saturation scale, a few times higher
in AA than in pA collisions at the energies of LHC. Since the dipole cross
section is proportional to the saturation momentum squared, the nuclei become
much more opaque for dipoles in AA than in pA collisions. For the same reason

$n_d$ both exhibit a characteristic $1/\ln\left(1/n_{2D}a_{2D}^{2}\right)$

the measured total cross sections that the high energy limit of the cross
section ratio is almost reached at an excess energy of only about 200 MeV. From
the differential distributions observed in the overall CMS as well as in the
Jackson and helicity frames, a significant contribution of interfering nucleon
resonances to the \Lambda production mechanism is concluded while resonant
\Sigma^0-production seems to be of lesser importance and takes place only
through specific partial waves of the entrance channel. The data also indicate
that kaon exchange plays a minor role in the case of \Lambda- but an important
role for \Sigma^0-production. Thus the peculiar energy dependence of the
\Lambda-to-\Sigma^0 cross section ratio appears in a new light as its
explanation requires more than mere differences between the p\Lambda and the
p\Sigma^0 final state interaction. The data provide a benchmark for theoretical
models already available or yet to come.

accretion on the location of young low-mass stars or brown dwarfs in the
Herzsprung-Russell diagram, we perform a detailed analysis devoted to the
effect of burst accretion on the internal structure of low-mass and solar type
stars. We find that episodic accretion can produce objects with significantly
higher central temperatures than the ones of the non accreting counterparts of
same mass and age. As a consequence, lithium depletion can be severely enhanced
in these objects. This provides a natural explanation for the unexpected level
of lithium depletion observed in young objects for the inferred age of their
parent cluster. These results confirm the limited reliability of lithium
abundance as a criterion for assessing or rejecting cluster membership. They
also show that lithium is not a reliable age indicator, because its fate
strongly depends on the past accretion history of the star. Under the
assumption that giant planets primarily form in massive disks prone to
gravitational instability and thus to accretion burst episodes, the same
analysis also explains the higher Li depletion observed in planet hosting
stars. At last, we show that, depending on the burst rate and intensity,
accretion outbursts can produce solar mass stars with lower convective envelope
masses, at ages less than a few tens of Myr, than predicted by standard (non or
slowly accreting) pre-main sequence models. This result has interesting,
although speculative, implications for the recently discovered depletion of
refractory elements in the Sun.

the spin correlations in untwinned YBCO crystals with x= 0.3, 0.35, and 0.45 as
a function of temperature and magnetic field. As the temperature T approaches
0, all samples exhibit static incommensurate magnetic order with propagation
vector along the a-direction in the CuO2 planes. The incommensurability delta
increases monotonically with hole concentration, as it does in LSCO. However,
delta is generally smaller than in LSCO at the same doping level. The intensity
of the incommensurate Bragg reflections increases with magnetic field for
YBCO(6.45) (superconducting Tc = 35 K), whereas it is field-independent for
YBCO(6.35) (Tc = 10 K). These results suggest that YBCO samples with x ~ 0.5
exhibit incommensurate magnetic order in the high fields used for the recent
quantum oscillation experiments on this system, which likely induces a
reconstruction of the Fermi surface. We present neutron spin-echo measurements
(with energy resolution ~ 1 micro-eV) for T > 0 that demonstrate a continuous
thermal broadening of the incommensurate magnetic Bragg reflections into a
quasielastic peak centered at excitation energy E = 0, consistent with the
zero-temperature transition expected for a two-dimensional spin system with
full spin-rotation symmetry. Measurements on YBCO(6.45) with a triple-axis
spectrometer (with energy resolution ~ 100 micro-eV) yield a crossover
temperature T_SDW ~ 30 K for the onset of quasi-static magnetic order. Upon
further heating, the wavevector characterizing low-energy spin excitations
approaches the commensurate antiferromagnetic wave vector, and the
incommensurability vanishes in an order-parameter-like fashion at an
""electronic liquid-crystal"" onset temperature T_ELC ~ 150 K. Both T_SDW and
T_ELC increase continuously as the Mott-insulating phase is approached with
decreasing doping level.

the multi-meter wavelength spectral window. One of the most exciting
applications of LOFAR will be the search for redshifted 21-cm line emission
from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). It is currently believed that the Dark
Ages, the period after recombination when the Universe turned neutral, lasted
until around the Universe was 400,000 years old. During the EoR, objects
started to form in the early universe and they were energetic enough to ionize
neutral hydrogen. The precision and accuracy required to achieve this
scientific goal, can be essentially translated into accumulating large amounts
of data. The data model describing the response of the LOFAR telescope to the
intensity distribution of the sky is characterized by the non-linearity of the
parameters and the large level of noise compared to the desired cosmological
signal. In this poster, we present the implementation of a statistically
optimal map-making process and its properties. The basic assumptions of this
method are that the noise is Gaussian and independent between the stations and
frequency channels and that the dynamic range of the data can been enhanced
significantly during the off-line LOFAR processing. These assumptions match our
expectations for the LOFAR Epoch of Reionization Experiment.

  spectral multiplicity","23 pages, 17 figures",,,,"math.DS math.CA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We investigate a class of mixing dynamical systems around the concept of
iceberg transformation. In brief, an iceberg transformation is defined using
symbolic language as follows. We build a sequence of words such that the next
word is a concatenation of rotated copies of the previous word. For example, a
word CAT can turn into CAT.ATC.TCA.TCA.CAT.ATC, then we repeat the procedure
applying it to this new word and so on. Geometrically, given an invertible
measure preserving transformation $T$ an iceberg is a union of two icelets for
the map $T$, one direct and one reverse with common base set, where icelet is
defined in a similar way as Rokhlin tower $B \sqcup TB \sqcup \ldots \sqcup
T^{h-1}B$, namely, an icelet is a sequence of disjoint measurable sets $\{B_0,
B_1, \ldots, B_{h-1}\}$ such that the levels are nested: $B_{j+1} \subseteq
TB_j$. Reverse icelet is defined as icelet for $T^{-1}$, and it grows towards
the past. Iceberg transformation is approximated by a sequence of icebergs,
resembling the behaviour of rank one ergodic maps.
  It is show that a class of random iceberg transformations almost surely has
simple spectrum, $1/4$-local rank property and spectral type $\sigma$ such that
$\sigma \conv \sigma \ll \la$ where $\la$ is the Lebesgue measure on the circle
$S^1$.

Grassmannian in a very direct way: he degenerated the intersection of a
Schubert variety X_mu and opposite Schubert variety X^nu to a union {X^lambda},
with repetition. This degeneration proceeds in stages, and along the way he met
a collection of more complicated subvarieties, which he identified as the
closures of certain locally closed sets.
  We show that Vakil's varieties are _positroid varieties_, which in particular
shows they are normal, Cohen-Macaulay, have rational singularities, and are
defined by the vanishing of Pl\""ucker coordinates [Knutson-Lam-Speyer]. We
determine the equations of the Vakil variety associated to a partially filled
``puzzle'' (building on the appendix to [Vakil]), and extend Vakil's proof to
give a geometric proof of the puzzle rule from [Knutson-Tao '03] for
equivariant Schubert calculus.
  The recent paper [Anderson-Griffeth-Miller] establishes (abstractly; without
a formula) three positivity results in equivariant K-theory of flag manifolds
G/P. We demonstrate one of these concretely, giving a corresponding puzzle
rule.

our model to calculate the chemical structure of disks on small scales
(sub-milli-arcsecond in the inner disk for objects at the distance of Taurus, ~
140 pc) to investigate the various chemical processes thought to be important
in disks and to determine potential molecular tracers of each process. Our
gas-phase network was extracted from the UMIST Database for Astrochemistry to
which we added gas-grain interactions including freeze out and thermal and
non-thermal desorption (cosmic-ray induced desorption, photodesorption and
X-ray desorption) and a grain-surface network. We find that cosmic-ray induced
desorption has the least effect on our disk chemical structure while
photodesorption has a significant effect, enhancing the abundances of most
gas-phase molecules throughout the disk and affecting the abundances and
distribution of HCN, CN and CS, in particular. In the outer disk, we also see
enhancements in the abundances of H2O and CO2. X-ray desorption is a
potentially powerful mechanism in disks, acting to homogenise the fractional
abundances of gas-phase species across the depth and increasing the column
densities of most molecules although there remain significant uncertainties in
the rates adopted for this process. The addition of grain-surface chemistry
enhances the fractional abundances of several small complex organic molecules
including CH3OH, HCOOCH3 and CH3OCH3 to potentially observable values (i.e. a
fractional abundance of >~ 1.0E-11).
