invariance of the geometry lead to energy and toroidal momentum conservation.
In various levels of ordering against fluctuation amplitude, energetic
consistency is exact. The role of this in underpinning of conservation laws is
emphasised. Local transport equations for the vorticity, toroidal momentum, and

densities can be assumed, both in the flat-sky limit and in the galactic

protoplanet, TMR-1C, that lies at a separation of about 10"" (~1000 AU) from the
Class I protobinary TMR-1 (IRAS 04361+2547). A narrow filament-like structure
was observed extending south-east from the central proto-binary system towards
TMR-1C, suggesting a morphology in which the candidate protoplanet may have
been ejected from the TMR-1 system. Follow-up low-resolution spectroscopy could
not confirm if this object is a protoplanet or a low-luminosity background
star. We present two epochs of near-infrared photometric observations obtained
at the CFHT of TMR-1C. The time span of ~7 years between the two sets of
observations provides with an opportunity to, (a) check for any photometric
variability similar to that observed among young stellar objects, which would
indicate the youth of this source, and, (b) determine the proper motion. TMR-1C
displays large photometric variability between 1 and 2 mag in both the H- and
Ks-bands. From our 2002 observations, we find a (H-Ks) color of 0.3 mag, which
is much bluer than the value of 1.3 mag reported by T98 from HST observations.
Also, we observe brightening in both the H- and Ks-bands when the colors are
bluer, i.e. the object gets redder as it becomes fainter. We have explored the
possible origins for the observed variability, and find extinction due to the
presence of circumstellar material to be the most likely scenario. The observed
large-amplitude photometric variations, and the possible presence of a
circumstellar disk, are strong arguments against this object being an old
background star.

bonds, the degeneracy of the ground state allows one to define a structure
called backbone, which can be characterized by the rigid lattice (RL),
consisting of the bonds that retain their frustration (or lack of it) in all
ground states. In this work we have performed a detailed numerical study of the
properties of the RL, both in two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D)

thermodynamic limit, in 2D our results indicate that the most probable scenario
is that the RL does not percolate. On the other hand, both in 2D and 3D we find
that frustration is very unevenly distributed. Frustration is much lower in the
RL than in its complement. Using equilibrium simulations we observe that this
property can be found even above the critical temperature. This leads us to
propose that the RL should share many properties of ferromagnetic models, an
idea that recently has also been proposed in other contexts. We also suggest a
preliminary generalization of the definition of backbone for systems with
continuous distributions of bonds, and we argue that the study of this

structure and the processes at play in extrasolar planetary systems. In binary
systems, this issue is more complex because the disc should in addition respond
to the companion star's perturbations. We explore the dynamical evolution of a
collisionally active debris disc for different initial parent body populations,
diverse binary configurations and optical depths. We focus on the radial extent
and size distribution of the disc at a stationary state. We numerically follow
the evolution of $10^{5}$ massless small grains, initially produced from a
circumprimary disc of parent bodies following a size distribution in $dN
\propto s^{-3.5}$ds . Grains are submitted to both stars' gravity as well as
radiation pressure. In addition, particles are assigned an empirically derived
collisional lifetime. For all the binary configurations the disc extends far
beyond the critical semimajor axis $a_crit$ for orbital stability. This is due
to the steady production of small grains, placed on eccentric orbits reaching
beyond $a_crit$ by radiation pressure. The amount of matter beyond acrit
depends on the balance between collisional production and dynamical removal
rates: it increases for more massive discs as well as for eccentric binaries.
Another important effect is that, in the dynamically stable region, the disc is
depleted from its smallest grains. Both results could lead to observable
signatures. We have shown that a companion star can never fully truncate a
collisionally active disc. For eccentric companions, grains in the unstable
regions can significantly contribute to the thermal emission in the mid-IR.
Discs with sharp outer edges, especially bright ones such as HR4796A, are
probably shaped by other mechanisms.

the color-color diagrams in BVI, plus a narrow-band filter centered at 6200A,
finding evidences that intrinsic color scales valid for main-sequence dwarfs
are incompatible with the ONC, while a better agreement is found employing
synthetic intrinsic colors obtained constraining the typical lower surface
gravity of young stars. We refine these model colors even further, empirically,
by comparison with a sample of ONC stars with no accretion and no extinction.
We consider the stars with known spectral types from the literature, and add 65
newly classified stars from slit spectroscopy and 182 M-type from narrow-band
photometry; in this way we isolate a sample of about 1000 stars with known
spectral type. We introduce a new method to self-consistently derive reddening
and accretion excess from the location of each star in the BVI color-color
diagram. This enables us to accurately determine the extinction of the ONC
members. We adopt a lower distance for the ONC than previously assumed, based
on recent parallax measurements. With a careful choice also of the spectral
type-temperature transformation, we produce the new H-R diagram of the ONC
population, more populated than previous works. With respect to previous works,
we find higher luminosity for late-type stars and a lower luminosity for early
types. We determine the age distribution of the population, peaking at 2-3 Myr,
a higher age than previously estimated. We study the distribution of the
members in the mass-age plane, and find that taking into account selection
effects due to incompleteness removes an apparent correlation between mass and
age. We derive the IMF for low- and intermediate-mass members of the ONC, which
turns out to be model-dependent, and shows a turn-over at ~<0.2Msun.

may produce collapsar gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), with jets driven by
magnetohydrodynamic processes, whose total isotropic-equivalent energy could be
as high as E_iso >~ 10^{57} erg over a cosmological-rest-frame duration of t_d

show that they will be detectable with the Swift BAT/XRT and Fermi LAT

electron-positron pair creation will be observable in the LAT energy range,
which can put constraints on the ambient density of the pre-collapse Pop. III
star. Thus, high redshift GRB afterglow observations could be unique and
powerful probes of the properties of Pop. III stars and their environments. We
examine the trigger threshold of the BAT instrument in detail, focusing on the
image trigger system, and show that the prompt emission of Pop. III GRBs could
also be detected by BAT. Finally we briefly show that the late-time radio
afterglows of Pop. III GRBs for typical parameters, despite the large

constraint on the Pop. III GRB rate from the current radio survey data, and
~2.4 mJy at 70 MHz, which implies that Pop. III GRB radio afterglows could be

pathways interconnecting into a complex network, yet the molecular complexity
of this network remains largely unsolved. Here, by employing systems biology
approach, we reveal a systemic virus-entry network initiated by human
cytomegalovirus (HCMV), a widespread opportunistic pathogen. This network
contains all known interactions and functional modules (i.e. groups of
proteins) coordinately responding to HCMV entry. The number of both genes and
functional modules activated in this network dramatically declines shortly,
within 25 min post-infection. While modules annotated as receptor system, ion
transport, and immune response are continuously activated during the entire
process of HCMV entry, those for cell adhesion and skeletal movement are
specifically activated during viral early attachment, and those for immune
response during virus entry. HCMV entry requires a complex receptor network
involving different cellular components, comprising not only cell surface
receptors, but also pathway components in signal transduction, skeletal
development, immune response, endocytosis, ion transport, macromolecule
metabolism and chromatin remodeling. Interestingly, genes that function in
chromatin remodeling are the most abundant in this receptor system, suggesting
that global modulation of transcriptions is one of the most important events in
HCMV entry. Results of in silico knock out further reveal that this entire
receptor network is primarily controlled by multiple elements, such as EGFR
(Epidermal Growth Factor) and SLC10A1 (sodium/bile acid cotransporter family,
member 1). Thus, our results demonstrate that a complex systemic network, in
which components coordinating efficiently in time and space contributes to

cooperation should be reinforced when conditional cooperators are more likely
to interact. In the context of social networks, this idea implies that
cooperation should fare better in highly clustered networks such as cliques
than in networks with low clustering such as random networks. To test this
hypothesis, we conducted a series of web-based experiments, in which 24
individuals played a local public goods game arranged on one of five network
topologies that varied between disconnected cliques and a random regular graph.
In contrast with previous theoretical work, we found that network topology had
no significant effect on average contributions. This result implies either that
individuals are not conditional cooperators, or else that cooperation does not
benefit from positive reinforcement between connected neighbors. We then tested
both of these possibilities in two subsequent series of experiments in which
artificial seed players were introduced, making either full or zero
contributions. First, we found that although players did generally behave like
conditional cooperators, they were as likely to decrease their contributions in
response to low contributing neighbors as they were to increase their
contributions in response to high contributing neighbors. Second, we found that
positive effects of cooperation were contagious only to direct neighbors in the
network. In total we report on 113 human subjects experiments, highlighting the
speed, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness of web-based experiments over those
conducted in physical labs.

whose spacetimes depend on only their mass, spin, and charge in vacuum (the ""no
hair"" theorem). As various observations probe deeper into the strong fields of
black hole candidates, it is becoming possible to test this prediction.
Previous work suggested that such tests can be performed by measuring whether
the multipolar structure of black hole candidates has the form that general
relativity demands, and introduced a family of ""bumpy black hole"" spacetimes to
be used for making these measurements. These spacetimes have generalized
multipoles, where the deviation from the Kerr metric depends on the spacetime's
""bumpiness."" In this paper, we show how to compute the Geroch-Hansen moments of
a bumpy black hole, demonstrating that there is a clean mapping between the
deviations used in the bumpy black hole formalism and the Geroch-Hansen
moments. We also extend our previous results to define bumpy black holes whose
{\it current} moments, analogous to magnetic moments of electrodynamics,
deviate from the canonical Kerr value.

at the origin of the depolarization of very intense laser beams propagating in
isotropic materials. The SISTOC process, like self-focusing, is triggered by
laser heating leading to a radial temperature gradient in the medium. In this
work we tested the occurrence of SISTOC in a terbium gallium garnet (TGG) rod
for an impinging laser power of about 100~W. To study the SISTOC process we
used different techniques: polarization analysis, interferometry and tomography
of the photon orbital angular momentum. Our results confirm, in particular,
that the apparent depolarization of the beam is due to the occurrence of
maximal entanglement between the spin and orbital angular momentum of the
photons undergoing the SISTOC process. This explanation of the true nature of
the depolarization mechanism could be of some help in finding novel methods to
reduce or to compensate for this usually unwanted depolarization effect in all
cases where very high laser power and good beam quality are required.

performance during an overload. The control is driven by a queue-difference
stochastic process, which operates in a faster time scale than the queueing
processes themselves, thus achieving a time-dependent steady state
instantaneously in the limit. As a result, for the ODE, the driving process is
replaced by its long-run average behavior at each instant of time; i.e., the

No additional information is provided about the number of latent variables, nor

to discover the number of latent components, and to learn a statistical model
over the entire collection of variables? We address this question in the
setting in which the latent and observed variables are jointly Gaussian, with
the conditional statistics of the observed variables conditioned on the latent
variables being specified by a graphical model. As a first step we give natural
conditions under which such latent-variable Gaussian graphical models are
identifiable given marginal statistics of only the observed variables.
Essentially these conditions require that the conditional graphical model among
the observed variables is sparse, while the effect of the latent variables is
""spread out"" over most of the observed variables. Next we propose a tractable
convex program based on regularized maximum-likelihood for model selection in
this latent-variable setting; the regularizer uses both the $\ell_1$ norm and
the nuclear norm. Our modeling framework can be viewed as a combination of
dimensionality reduction (to identify latent variables) and graphical modeling
(to capture remaining statistical structure not attributable to the latent
variables), and it consistently estimates both the number of latent components
and the conditional graphical model structure among the observed variables.
These results are applicable in the high-dimensional setting in which the
number of latent/observed variables grows with the number of samples of the
observed variables. The geometric properties of the algebraic varieties of
sparse matrices and of low-rank matrices play an important role in our
analysis.

1.6 solar masses. Most of these stars will have convective cores during their
Main-sequence evolution. At the edges of these convective cores there is a
rapid variation in the sound speed which influences the frequencies of acoustic
oscillations. In this paper we build on earlier work by Cunha and Metcalfe, to
investigate further the impact that these rapid structural variations have on
different p-mode frequency combinations, involving modes of low degree. In
particular, we adopt a different expression to describe the sound speed
variation at the edge of the core, which we show to reproduce more closely the
profiles derived from the equilibrium models. We analyse the impact of this
change on the frequency perturbation derived for radial modes. Moreover, we
consider three different small frequency separations involving, respectively,
modes of degree l = 0, 1, 2, 3; l = 0, 1; and l = 0, 2, and show that they are
all significantly affected by the sharp sound speed variation at the edge of
the core. In particular, we confirm that the frequency derivative of the
diagnostic tool that combines modes of degree up to 3 can potentially be used
to infer directly the amplitude of the relative sound speed variation at the
edge of the core. Concerning the other two diagnostic tools, we show that at
high frequencies they can be up to a few microhertzs smaller than what would be
expected in the absence of the rapid structural variation at the edge of the
core. Also, we show that the absolute values of their frequency derivatives are
significantly increased, in a manner that is strongly dependent on stellar age.

Profilometry on objects having non-monochromatic surfaces is considered as one
of the remaining most challenges faced by the currently existing
structured-light projection methods since the surface reflectivity to red,
green and blue light may vary significantly. To address this, an innovative
colour calibration method for hue component is developed to determine the
accurate reflectivity response of the measured surface. The trapezoidal colour
pattern is calibrated to compensate the hue-shifted quantity induced by the
reflective characteristics of the object's surface. The developed method can
reconstruct precise 3-D surface models from objects by acquiring a single-shot
image, which can achieve high-speed profilometry and avoid in-situ potential
measurement disturbances such as environmental vibration. To verify the
feasibility of the developed methodology, some experiments were conducted to
confirm that the measurement accuracy can be controlled within 2.5% of the

beryllium-9 nucleus at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility
(JLab), clustering aspects are studied in structure functions of deep inelastic
lepton-nucleus scattering by using momentum distributions calculated in
antisymmetrized (or fermionic) molecular dynamics (AMD) and also in a simple
shell model for comparison. According to the AMD, the Be-9 nucleus consists of
two alpha-like clusters with a surrounding neutron. The clustering produces
high-momentum components in nuclear wave functions, which affects nuclear
modifications of the structure functions. We investigated whether clustering
features could appear in the structure function F_2 of Be-9 along with studies
for other light nuclei. We found that nuclear modifications of F_2 are similar
in both AMD and shell models within our simple convolution description although
there are slight differences in Be-9. It indicates that the anomalous Be-9
result should be explained by a different mechanism from the nuclear binding
and Fermi motion. If nuclear-modification slopes d(F_2^A/F_2^D)/dx are shown by
the maximum local densities, the Be-9 anomaly can be explained by the AMD
picture, namely by the clustering structure, whereas it certainly cannot be
described in the simple shell model. This fact suggests that the large nuclear
modification in Be-9 should be explained by large densities in the clusters.
For example, internal nucleon structure could be modified in the high-density
clusters. The clustering aspect of nuclear structure functions is an unexplored
topic which is interesting for future investigations.

good agreement between the calculated and observed [CII] intensities. HIFI

confined two dimensional electron systems with both the Rashba and Dresselhaus
spin-orbit interactions. The starting point of our perturbative expansion is a
zeroth-order Hamiltonian for an electron confined in a quantum wire with an
effective spin-orbit induced magnetic field along the wire, obtained by
properly rotating the usual spin-orbit Hamiltonian. We find that the
spin-orbit-related transverse coupling terms can be recast into two parts W and
V, which couple crossing and non-crossing adjacent transverse modes,
respectively. Interestingly, the zeroth-order Hamiltonian together with W can
be solved exactly, as it maps onto the Jaynes-Cummings model of quantum optics.
We treat the V coupling by performing a Schrieffer-Wolff transformation. This
allows us to obtain an effective Hamiltonian to third order in the coupling
strength k_Rl of V, which can be straightforwardly diagonalized via an
additional unitary transformation. We also apply our approach to other types of
effective parabolic confinement, e.g., 2D electrons in a perpendicular magnetic
field. To demonstrate the usefulness of our approximate eigensolutions, we
obtain analytical expressions for the n^th Landau-level g_n-factors in the
presence of both Rashba and Dresselhaus couplings. For small values of the bulk
g-factors, we find that spin-orbit effects cancel out entirely for particular
values of the spin-orbit couplings. By solving simple transcendental equations
we also obtain the band minima of a Rashba-coupled quantum wire as a function
of an external magnetic field. These can be used to describe Shubnikov-de Haas
oscillations. This procedure makes it easier to extract the strength of the
spin-orbit interaction in these systems via proper fitting of the data.

populations in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) have the nitrogen abundances
  ([N/H]) by a factor of ~7 lower than the solar value. We here discuss a new
scenario in which the observed unusually low nitrogen abundances can be closely
associated with recent collision and subsequent accretion of HI high velocity
clouds (HVCs) that surround the Galaxy and have low nitrogen abundances. We
show that if the observed low [N/H] is limited to very young stars with ages
less than ~10^7 yr, then the collision/accretion rate of the HVCs onto the LMC
needs to be ~ 0.2 M_sun/yr (corresponding to the total HVC mass of 10^6-10^7
M_sun) to dilute the original interstellar medium (ISM) before star formation.
The required accretion rate means that even if the typical mass of HVCs
accreted onto the LMC is ~ 10^7 M_sun, the Galaxy needs to have ~2500 massive
HVCs within the LMC's orbital radius with respect to the Galactic center. The
required rather large number of massive HVCs drives us to suggest that the HVCs
are not likely to efficiently dilute the ISM of the LMC and consequently lower
the [N/H]. We thus suggest the transfer of gas with low [N/H] from the Small
Magellanic Cloud (SMC) to the LMC as a promising scenario that can explain the
observed low [N/H].

provide a powerful tool to generate more general high frequency solutions that
are not necessarily concentrated on a single curve. This work is concerned with
the accuracy of Gaussian beam superpositions in terms of the wavelength
$\epsilon$. We present a systematic construction of Gaussian beam
superpositions for all strictly hyperbolic and Schr\""odinger equations subject
to highly oscillatory initial data of the form $Ae^{i\Phi/\epsilon}$. Through a
careful estimate of an oscillatory integral operator, we prove that the $k$-th
order Gaussian beam superposition converges to the original wave field at a
rate proportional to $\epsilon^{k/2}$ in the appropriate norm dictated by the
well-posedness estimate. In particular, we prove that the Gaussian beam
superposition converges at this rate for the acoustic wave equation in the
standard, $\epsilon$-scaled, energy norm and for the Schr\""odinger equation in
the $L^2$ norm. The obtained results are valid for any number of spatial
dimensions and are unaffected by the presence of caustics. We present a

this method to study the properties of Quantum Graphity models at low

much greater than the coupling constants of the loop terms. Using mean field
theory we find that an order parameter for the model is the average valence of
the graph. We calculate the equilibrium distribution for the valence as an

be governed by an evolution equation of fractional order in time, which

for the Cauchy and Signalling problems are expressed in terms of entire
functions (of Wright type) in the similarity variable and their behaviours turn
out to be intermediate between those for the limiting cases of a perfectly

exhibited by the seismic pulses, the nearly elastic limit is considered.

almost all existing methods of variable/feature selection critically depend on
sparsity of models. However, for ``large $p$ and small $n$"" models sparsity
assumption is hard to check and particularly, when this assumption is violated,
the consistency of all existing estimations is usually impossible because
working models selected by existing methods such as the LASSO and the Dantzig
selector are usually biased. To attack this problem, we in this paper propose
adaptive post-Dantzig estimation and model prediction. Here the adaptability
means that the consistency based on the newly proposed method is adaptive to
non-sparsity of model, choice of shrinkage tuning parameter and dimension of
predictor vector. The idea is that after a sub-model as a working model is
determined by the Dantzig selector, we construct a globally unbiased sub-model
by choosing suitable instrumental variables and nonparametric adjustment. The
new estimation of the parameters in the sub-model can be of the asymptotic
normality. The consistent estimator, together with the selected sub-model and
adjusted model, improves model predictions. Simulation studies show that the
new approach has the significant improvement of estimation and prediction
accuracies over the Gaussian Dantzig selector and other classical methods have.
