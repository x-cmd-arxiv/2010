optics-like phenomena in electronics, including magnetic focusing and lensing.
An extension that appears unique to graphene is to use both n and p carrier
types to create electronic analogs of optical devices having both positive and
negative indices of refraction. Here, we use gate-controlled density with both
p and n carrier types to demonstrate the analog of the fiber-optic guiding in
graphene. Two basic effects are investigated: (1) bipolar p-n junction guiding,
based on the principle of angle-selective transmission though the graphene p-n
interface, and (2) unipolar fiber-optic guiding, using total internal
reflection controlled by carrier density. Modulation of guiding efficiency
through gating is demonstrated and compared to numerical simulations, which
indicates that interface roughness limits guiding performance, with
few-nanometer effective roughness extracted. The development of p-n and
fiber-optic guiding in graphene may lead to electrically reconfigurable wiring
in high-mobility devices.

tensor field constraint H_{}^2=\pm M^2 (M is the proposed scale for Lorentz
violation) is considered in tensor field gravity theory, which mimics
linearized general relativity in Minkowski space-time. We show that such a SLIV
pattern, due to which the true vacuum in the theory is chosen, induces massless
tensor Goldstone modes some of which can naturally be associated with the
physical graviton. When expressed in terms of the pure Goldstone modes, this
theory looks essentially nonlinear and contains a variety of Lorentz and CPT
violating couplings. Nonetheless, all SLIV effects turn out to be strictly
cancelled in all the lowest order processes considered, provided that the
tensor field gravity theory is properly extended to general relativity (GR).
So, as we generally argue, the measurable effects of SLIV, induced by
elementary vector or tensor fields, are related to the accompanying gauge
symmetry breaking rather than to spontaneous Lorentz violation. The latter
appears by itself to be physically unobservable, only resulting in a
non-covariant gauge choice in an otherwise gauge invariant and Lorentz
invariant theory. However, while Goldstonic vector and tensor field theories
with exact local invariance are physically indistinguishable from conventional
gauge theories, there might appear some principal distinctions if this local
symmetry were slightly broken at very small distances controlled by quantum
gravity in an explicit, rather than spontaneous, way that could eventually
allow one to differentiate between them observationally.

the measurement problem and with the Many World Interpretation. It is argued
that this problem actually corresponds to two inequivalent problems: (i) the
preferred-decomposition problem, i.e., what singles out a preferred
decomposition of a suitable state vector of a system as the sum of a finite or
countable set of vectors?, and (ii) the preferred-representation problem, i.e.,
what singles out a preferred representation for the Hilbert space of a system?
In this paper the preferred-decomposition problem is addressed and two
processes, namely decoherence and permanent spatial decomposition (PSD), are
examined and compared as possible solutions to this problem. It is shown that,
perhaps contrary to common belief, in realistic situations decoherence is not
sufficient to solve the preferred-decomposition problem. PSD is the
(hypothesized) tendency of the wave function of the universe to decompose into
permanently non-overlapping wave packets. Three phases can be roughly
identified as composing PSD: Microscopic decomposition, amplification, and
interaction with the environment. Decoherence theory considers only the
interaction with the environment and ignores the first two phases. For this
reason PSD is fundamentally different from decoherence and, unlike decoherence,
provides a simple and non-elusive solution to the preferred-decomposition
problem.

cohomological degrees, such as the homological degree hdeg, and the extremal

  Sally, Valla and others have established bounds for the number of generators

usually under the assumption that the ideal is Cohen-Macaulay. We use
cohomological degrees and the homological Dilworth number in place of the
classical degree to extend some of these results from the Cohen-Macaulay case
to the non-Cohen-Macaulay case. We give particular attention to the following
result: If M is Cohen-Macaulay, then the minimal number of generators is
bounded by the multiplicity of M, with equality if and only if the associated
graded ring has a linear resolution. We give extensions of this theorem to the
non-Cohen-Macaulay case. Our results are strongest for the extremal
cohomological degree, bdeg, and this provides an avenue for connecting
cohomological degrees with Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity.

so, we make the assumption of thermodynamic equilibrium between the liquid and
the atmosphere, the abundances of the different constituents being determined
via {\bf } regular solution theory. We find that xenon's atmospheric depletion
can be explained by its dissolution at ambient temperature in the liquid
presumably present on Titan's soil. In the cases of argon and krypton, we find
that the fractions incorporated in the liquid are negligible, implying that an

planets are observed to exist per star in typical galaxies like the Milky Way,
not eight or nine. Stars form by a binary accretional cascade from Earth-mass
primordial planets to progressively larger masses that collect and recycle the
stardust chemicals of life produced when stars overeat and explode. The
astonishing complexity of molecular biology observed on Earth is possible to
explain only if enormous numbers of primordial planets and their fragments have
hosted the formation and wide scattering of the seeds of life virtually from
the beginning of time. Geochemical and biological evidence suggests that life
on Earth appears at the earliest moment it can survive, in highly evolved forms

application. The advantage of Monte Carlo methods is that they may be extended
to risk functions that are more complicated functions of the return
distribution, and that the underlying return distribution may be computed
without the classical Gaussian limitations. The optimization of quadratic
risk-return functions, VaR, CVaR, may be handled in a similar manner to
variability ratios such as Sortino and Omega, or mathematical constructions
such as expected utility and its behavioural finance extensions.
Robustification is also possible. Grid computing technology is an excellent
platform for the development of such computations due to the intrinsically
parallel nature of the computation, coupled to the requirement to transmit only
small packets of data over the grid. We give some examples deploying
GridMathematica, in which various investor risk preferences are optimized with
differing multivariate distributions. Good comparisons with established results
in Mean-Variance and CVaR optimization are obtained when ``edge-vertex-biased''

The survey consists of deep images of 55 0.6x0.6 degree fields at distances up
to 20 degrees from the LMC/SMC, and 10 controls. The fields probe the outer
structure of the Clouds, the Magellanic Stream, the Leading Arm, and the wake
of the new LMC orbit. Images were taken in 5 filters on the CTIO Blanco 4-m and
Mosaic2 camera, with calibration at the CTIO 0.9-m. The CRI images reach depths
below the oldest LMC/SMC main sequence (MS) turnoffs, yielding probes of
structure combined with ability to measure stellar ages and metallicities. M
and DDO51 images allow for discrimination of LMC and SMC giant stars from
foreground dwarfs, allowing us to use giants as additional probes. From
photometry of 8 fields at radii of 7-19 degrees N of the LMC bar, we find MS
stars associated with the LMC to 16 degrees from the LMC center, while the much
rarer giants can only be convincingly detected out to 11 degrees. In one
control field, we see the signature of the Milky Way globular cluster NGC 1851.
The CMDs show that while at 7-degree radius LMC populations as young as 500 Myr
are present, at radii more than 11 degrees only the underlying old metal-poor
population remains, demonstrating the existence of a population gradient. Even
at extreme distances, the dominant age is much less than ""globular Cluster
age."" MS star counts follow an exponential decline with a scale length of 1.15
kpc, essentially the same scale length as gleaned for the inner LMC disk from
prior studies. While we cannot rule out tidal structure elsewhere, detection of
ordered structure to 12 disk scale lengths is unprecedented, and adds to the
puzzle of the LMC's interaction history. Our results do not rule out the
possible existence of an LMC stellar halo, which may only dominate the disk at
yet larger radii.

the infrared astronomical satellite AKARI, covering 2.5--5.0 um with a spectral
resolution of approximately 120. The spectral types of the objects range from
L5 to T8, and enable us to study the spectral evolution of brown dwarfs. The
observed spectra are in general consistent with the predictions from the
previous observations and photospheric models. We find that the CO fundamental
band around 4.6 um is clearly seen even in the T8 dwarf 2MASS J041519-0935,
confirming the presence of non-equilibrium chemical state in the atmosphere. We
also identify the CO_2 fundamental stretching-mode band at 4.2 um for the first
time in the spectra of late-L and T-type brown dwarfs.
  We analyze the observed spectra by comparing with the predicted ones based on
the Unified Cloudy Model (UCM). Although overall spectral energy distributions
(SEDs) can be reasonably fitted with the UCM, observed CO and CO_2 bands in
late-L and T-dwarfs are unexpectedly stronger than the model predictions
assuming local thermodynamical equilibrium (LTE). We examine the vertical
mixing model and find that this model explains the CO band at least partly in
the T-dwarfs 2MASS J041519-0935 and 2MASS J055919-1404. The CO fundamental band
also shows excess absorption against the predicted one in the L9 dwarf SDSS
J083008+4828. Since CO is already highly abundant in the upper photospheres of
late-L dwarfs, the extra CO by vertical mixing has little effect on the CO band
strengths, and the vertical mixing model cannot be applied to this L-dwarf. A
more serious problem is that the significant enhancement of the CO_2 4.2 um
band in both the late-L and T dwarfs cannot be explained at all by the vertical
mixing model. The enhancement of the CO_2 band remains puzzling.

array of sensing elements - the Multiwire Proportional Chamber (MWPC), which
earned Georges Charpak a Nobel prize in physics in 1992. Since that time
radiation detection and imaging with fast gaseous detectors, capable of
economically covering large detection volume with low mass budget, have been
playing an important role in many fields of physics. Advances in
photo-lithography and micro-processing techniques in the chip industry during
the past decade triggered a major transition in the field of gas detectors from
wire structures to Micro-Pattern Gas Detector (MPGD) concepts, revolutionizing
cell size limitations for many gas detector applications. The high radiation
resistance and excellent spatial and time resolution make them an invaluable
tool to confront future detector challenges at the next generation of
colliders. The design of the new micro-pattern devices appears suitable for
industrial production. Novel structures where MPGDs are directly coupled to the
CMOS pixel readout represent an exciting field allowing timing and charge
measurements as well as precise spatial information in 3D. Originally developed
for the high energy physics, MPGD applications has expanded to nuclear physics,
UV and visible photon detection, astroparticle and neutrino physics, neutron
detection and medical physics.

be measured, only above $\sim 10 R_\sun$. The mass density ($g/R_\sun^2$) of
CMEs varies relatively little ($<$ order of magnitude) suggesting that the

Consequently, it causes the suppression of hyperons, resulting in the stiffness

from conventional classifiers that are designed for a low overall

provide such an algorithm here. We show a special case of the biased minimax

cleaning and entity resolution. Enforcing a matching dependency on a database
instance identifies the values of some attributes for two tuples, provided that
the values of some other attributes are sufficiently similar. Assuming the
existence of matching functions for making two attributes values equal, we
formally introduce the process of cleaning an instance using matching
dependencies, as a chase-like procedure. We show that matching functions
naturally introduce a lattice structure on attribute domains, and a partial
order of semantic domination between instances. Using the latter, we define the
semantics of clean query answering in terms of certain/possible answers as the
greatest lower bound/least upper bound of all possible answers obtained from
the clean instances. We show that clean query answering is intractable in some
cases. Then we study queries that behave monotonically wrt semantic domination
order, and show that we can provide an under/over approximation for clean

faster orthogonal to the pulsar-""blob"" direction than along this axis of

along where energy in the PWN is mainly injected, and that this is then
mediated to the filaments in the PWN by shocks. We highlight this by
constructing an [S II]-to-[O III]-ratio map. We argue, through modeling, that

smaller and this sharp feature is gradually smeared out, leading to a single

A significant generalization to the language-measure-theoretic path planning

uncertainties and estimation errors in plan execution. The notion of the
navigation automaton is generalized to include probabilistic uncontrollable
transitions, which account for uncertainties by modeling and planning for
probabilistic deviations from the computed policy in the course of execution.
The planning problem is solved by casting it in the form of a performance
maximization problem for probabilistic finite state automata. In essence we
solve the following optimization problem: Compute the navigation policy which
maximizes the probability of reaching the goal, while simultaneously minimizing
the probability of hitting an obstacle. Key novelties of the proposed approach
include the modeling of uncertainties using the concept of uncontrollable
transitions, and the solution of the ensuing optimization problem using a
highly efficient search-free combinatorial approach to maximize quantitative
measures of probabilistic regular languages. Applicability of the algorithm in
various models of robot navigation has been shown with experimental validation

words, we define gauge invariant quantum fields which are used to build the
action. In that framework, the Higgs field is not necessarily a physical degree
of freedom but can merely be a dressing field that does not propagate. If the
Higgs boson is not propagating, the weak interactions must become strongly
coupled below 1 TeV and have a non-trivial fixed point and would thus be
renormalizable at the non-perturbative level. On the other hand, if a gauge
invariant Higgs boson is introduced in the model, its couplings to the fermions
and the electroweak bosons can be quite different from those expected in the
standard model.

We organize an infinite-size system of integral-differential equations by means
of the density dependent jump Markov process, and obtain a close-form solution:
doubly exponential structure, for the fixed point satisfying the system of
nonlinear equations, which is always a key in the study of supermarket models.
The fixed point is decomposited into two groups of information under a product
form: the arrival information and the service information. based on this, we
indicate two important observations: the fixed point for the supermarket model
is different from the tail of stationary queue length distribution for the
ordinary M/G/1 queue, and the doubly exponential solution to the fixed point
can extensively exist even if the service time distribution is heavy-tailed.
Furthermore, we analyze the exponential convergence of the current location of
the supermarket model to its fixed point, and study the Lipschitz condition in
the Kurtz Theorem under general service times. Based on these analysis, one can
gain a new understanding how workload probing can help in load balancing jobs
with general service times such as heavy-tailed service.

externally driven, nonlinear systems, and continue to provoke new questions
that challenge our physical and mathematical understanding. In one specific
sub-class of such problems, where a pattern-forming, or `Turing', instability
occurs, rapid progress has been made recently in our understanding of the
formation of localized states: patches of regular pattern surrounded by the
unpatterned homogeneous background state. This short review article surveys the
progress that has been made for localized states, proposes three areas of
application for these ideas that would take the theory in new directions and
ultimately be of substantial benefit to areas of applied science. Finally I
offer speculations for future work, based on localized states, that may help
researchers to understand coherent structures more generally.

formation process, only a few magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations have been
performed on this subject within the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH)
method. This is largely due to the unsatisfactory treatment of non-vanishing
divergence of the magnetic field. Recently smoothed particle
magnetohydrodynamics (SPMHD) simulations based on Euler potentials have proven
to be successful in treating MHD collapse and fragmentation problems, however
these methods are known to have some intrinsical difficulties. We have
performed SPMHD simulations based on a traditional approach evolving the
magnetic field itself using the induction equation. To account for the
numerical divergence, we have chosen an approach that subtracts the effects of
numerical divergence from the force equation, and additionally we employ
artificial magnetic dissipation as a regularization scheme. We apply this
realization of SPMHD to a widely known setup, a variation of the 'Boss &
Bodenheimer standard isothermal test case', to study the impact of the magnetic
fields on collapse and fragmentation. In our simulations, we concentrate on
setups, where the initial magnetic field is parallel to the rotation axis. We
examine different field strengths and compare our results to other findings
reported in the literature. We are able to confirm specific results found
elsewhere, namely the delayed onset of star formation for strong fields,
accompanied by the tendency to form only single stars. We also find that the
'magnetic cushioning effect', where the magnetic field is wound up to form a
'cushion' between the binary, aids binary fragmentation in a case, where
previously only formation of a single protostar was expected.

outflow with nir narrow-band filters . The H2 line-emission structures appear
distributed over a region of 5.5' (0.5 pc for a distance of 300 pc) at both

the coefficient of the low temperature T$^3$ behavior of the specific heat

significant enhancement of the Sommerfeld coefficient is found in the vicinity
of the QCP suggesting a slight increase of the electronic effective mass. This
result contrasts with the divergent behavior of the previously reported Pauli
susceptibility. Thus, a strongly enhanced Wilson ratio is deduced, suggesting
efficient ferromagnetic fluctuations in the Fermi liquid regime which could
explain the unusual magnetic field dependent specific heat. As a strong check,
the high magnetic field Wilson ratio asymptotically recovers the universal

abstract operators. By writing abstract operators in this class into integral
forms, the solutions in operator form are represented into integral forms. We
thus solved the important problem of representing the solutions of linear
higher-order partial differential equations into the integrations of some given

discuss the solvability of initial-boundary value problem for the linear
higher-order partial differential equations.

source node transmits a message to a destination node with the help of N

relays are identical and the channel gains from the relays are identical, the
capacity of this channel is unknown in general. The best known capacity
approximation is up to an additive gap of order N bits and up to a
multiplicative gap of order N^2, with both gaps independent of the channel
gains.
  In this paper, we approximate the capacity of the symmetric Gaussian N-relay

the best previously known result, are also independent of the number of relays
N in the network. Achievability is based on bursty amplify-and-forward, showing
that this simple scheme is uniformly approximately optimal, both in the
low-rate as well as in the high-rate regimes. The upper bound on capacity is
based on a careful evaluation of the cut-set bound. We also present
approximation results for the asymmetric Gaussian N-relay diamond network. In

Barium-rich material, lost in a stellar wind from a thermally-pulsing
asymptotic-giant branch star in a binary system, is accreted by its companion
main-sequence star. Now, many millions of years later, the primary is an unseen
white dwarf and the secondary has itself evolved into a giant which displays
absorption lines of barium in its spectrum and is what we call a barium star. A
similar wind-accretion mechanism is also thought to form the low-metallicity CH
and carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars. Qualitatively the picture seems clear but
quantitatively it is decidedly murky: several key outstanding problems remain
which challenge our basic understanding of binary-star physics. Barium stars
with orbital periods less than about 4,000 days should -- according to theory
-- be in circular orbits because of tidal dissipation, yet they are often
observed to be eccentric. Only one barium-star period longer than 10^4 days has
been published although such stars are predicted to exist in large numbers. In
this paper we attempt to shed light on these problems. First, we consider the
impact of kicking the white dwarf at its birth, a notion which is supported by
independent evidence from studies of globular clusters. Second, we increase the
amount of orbital angular momentum loss during wind mass transfer, which
shrinks barium-star binaries to the required period range. We conclude with a
discussion of possible physical mechanisms and implications of a kick, such as
the break up of wide barium-star binaries and the limits imposed on our models
by observations.

whether or not there is a significant population of metal-poor thick-disk stars

present abundances of four alpha-elements (Mg, Si, Ca, Ti) and iron for a
subsample of 212 RGB and 31 RC/HB stars from this study. We find that the
[alpha/Fe] ratios are enhanced implying that enrichment proceeded by purely
core-collapse supernovae. This requires that star formation in each star
forming region had a short duration. The relative lack of scatter in the
[alpha/Fe] ratios implies good mixing in the ISM prior to star formation. In
addition, the ratios resemble that of the halo, indicating that the halo and
thick disk share a similar massive star IMF. We conclude that the alpha
enhancement of the metal-poor thick disk implies that direct accretion of stars
from dwarf galaxies similar to surviving dwarf galaxies today did not play a
major role in the formation of the thick disk.

preferences). We consider the issue of judgement aggregation from the
perspective of approximation. That is, we generalize the previous results by
studying approximate judgement aggregation. We relax the main two constraints
assumed in the current literature, Consistency and Independence and consider
mechanisms that only approximately satisfy these constraints, that is, satisfy
them up to a small portion of the inputs. The main question we raise is whether
the relaxation of these notions significantly alters the class of satisfying
aggregation mechanisms. The recent works for preference aggregation of Kalai,
Mossel, and Keller fit into this framework. The main result of this paper is
that, as in the case of preference aggregation, in the case of a subclass of a
natural class of aggregation problems termed `truth-functional agendas', the
set of satisfying aggregation mechanisms does not extend non-trivially when
relaxing the constraints. Our proof techniques involve Boolean Fourier
transform and analysis of voter influences for voting protocols. The question
we raise for Approximate Aggregation can be stated in terms of Property
Testing. For instance, as a corollary from our result we get a generalization
of the classic result for property testing of linearity of Boolean functions.

of the Cosserat theory of elasticity. Rotations of material points are
described mathematically by attaching to each geometric point an orthonormal
basis which gives a field of orthonormal bases called the coframe. As the
dynamical variables (unknowns) of our theory we choose the coframe and a
density. We write down the general dynamic variational functional for our
rotational theory of elasticity, assuming our material to be physically linear
but the kinematic model geometrically nonlinear. Allowing geometric
nonlinearity is natural when dealing with rotations because rotations in
dimension 3 are inherently nonlinear (rotations about different axes do not
commute) and because there is no reason to exclude from our study large
rotations such as full turns. The main result of the paper is an explicit
construction of a class of time-dependent solutions which we call plane wave
solutions; these are travelling waves of rotations. The existence of such
explicit closed form solutions is a nontrivial fact given that our system of
Euler-Lagrange equations is highly nonlinear. In the last section we consider a
special case of our rotational theory of elasticity which in the stationary
setting (harmonic time dependence and arbitrary dependence on spatial
coordinates) turns out to be equivalent to a pair of massless Dirac equations.

identified. Finally, we show that methods in the fourth category are largely
irrelevant to public elections. Interestingly, most of these methods for
satisfying the SFBC do so only ``weakly,"" in that these methods make no
meaningful distinction between the first and second place on the ballot.
However, when we relax our conditions and allow (but do not require) equal
rankings for first place, a wider range of voting methods are possible, and
