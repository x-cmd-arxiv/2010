nanotube quantum dot with multiple gate electrodes. It is found that the
splitting decreases for increasing magnetic field, to result in a recovered
zero-bias Kondo resonance at finite magnetic field. Surprisingly, in the same
charge state, but under different gate-configurations, the splitting does not
disappear for any value of the magnetic field, but we observe an avoided
crossing of two high-conductance lines. We think that our observations can be
understood in terms of a two-impurity Kondo effect with two spins coupled
antiferromagnetically. The exchange coupling between the two spins can be
influenced by a local gate, and the non-recovery of the Kondo resonance for
certain gate configurations is explained by the existence of a small
antisymmetric contribution to the exchange interaction between the two spins.

many body quantum systems. The main cost of many QMC methods, for example the
variational Monte Carlo (VMC) method, is in constructing a sequence of Slater
matrices and computing the ratios of determinants for successive Slater
matrices. Recent work has improved the scaling of constructing Slater matrices
for insulators so that the cost of constructing Slater matrices in these
systems is now linear in the number of particles, whereas computing determinant
ratios remains cubic in the number of particles. With the long term aim of
simulating much larger systems, we improve the scaling of computing the
determinant ratios in the VMC method for simulating insulators by using
preconditioned iterative solvers.
  The main contribution of this paper is the development of a method to
efficiently compute for the Slater matrices a sequence of preconditioners that
make the iterative solver converge rapidly. This involves cheap preconditioner
updates, an effective reordering strategy, and a cheap method to monitor
instability of ILUTP preconditioners. Using the resulting preconditioned
iterative solvers to compute determinant ratios of consecutive Slater matrices
reduces the scaling of QMC algorithms from O(n^3) per sweep to roughly O(n^2),
where n is the number of particles, and a sweep is a sequence of n steps, each
attempting to move a distinct particle. We demonstrate experimentally that we
can achieve the improved scaling without increasing statistical errors. Our
results show that preconditioned iterative solvers can dramatically reduce the
cost of VMC for large(r) systems.

confirm earlier work regarding the influence of mergers on the mass density
profile and the inside-out growth of halos. The inner regions that contain the
visible galaxies are stable since early times and are significantly affected
only by major mergers. Particles accreted diffusely or in minor mergers are
found predominantly in the outskirts of halos. Our analysis reveals trends that
run counter to current perceptions of hierarchical halo assembly. For example,
major mergers (i.e. those with progenitor mass ratios greater than 1:10)
contribute little to the total mass growth of a halo, on average less than 20
per cent for our six Aquarius halos. The bulk is contributed roughly equally by
minor mergers and by ""diffuse"" material which is not resolved into individual
objects. This is consistent with modeling based on excursion-set theory which
suggests that about half of this diffuse material should not be part of a halo
of any scale. Interestingly, the simulations themselves suggest that a
significantly fraction is not truly diffuse, since it was ejected from earlier
halos by mergers prior to their joining the main system. The Aquarius
simulations resolve halos to much lower mass scales than are expected to retain
gas or form stars. These results thus confirm that most of the baryons from
which visible galaxies form are accreted diffusely, rather than through
mergers, and they suggest that only relatively rare major mergers will affect
galaxy structure at later times.

high-precision average line profiles from the stellar intensity and

documented and has never been tested using realistic synthetic spectra. In this
study we revisit the key assumptions of the LSD technique, clarify its
numerical implementation, discuss possible improvements and give
recommendations how to make LSD results understandable and reproducible. We
also address the problem of interpretation of the moments and shapes of the LSD
profiles in terms of physical parameters. We have developed an improved,
multiprofile version of LSD and have extended the deconvolution procedure to
linear polarization analysis taking into account anomalous Zeeman splitting of
spectral lines. This code is applied to the theoretical Stokes parameter
spectra. We test various methods of interpreting the mean profiles,
investigating how coarse approximations of the multiline technique translate
into errors of the derived parameters. We find that, generally, the Stokes
parameter LSD profiles do not behave as a real spectral line with respect to
the variation of magnetic field and elemental abundance. This problem is
especially prominent for the Stokes I variation with abundance and Stokes Q
variation with magnetic field. At the same time, the Stokes V LSD spectra
closely resemble profile of a properly chosen synthetic line for the magnetic
field strength up to 1 kG. We conclude that the usual method of interpreting
the LSD profiles by assuming that they are equivalent to a real spectral line
gives satisfactory results only in a limited parameter range and thus should be
applied with caution. A more trustworthy approach is to abandon the single-line
approximation of the average profiles and apply LSD consistently to
observations and synthetic spectra.

check whether it could be observed by Planck or the Atacama Large Millimeter
Array (ALMA), or even imprint the current CMB data as, e.g., the specific
fluctuation excess claimed from an recent reanalysis of the WMAP-5 data. We
focus on high-latitude regions to avoid contamination of the Galactic
astrophysical electron foreground, and consider the annihilation or decay
coming from the smooth dark matter halo as well as from subhalos, further
extending our analysis to a generic modeling of spikes arising around
intermediate-mass black holes. We show that all these dark Galactic components
are unlikely to produce any observable Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect. For a
self-annihilating dark matter particle of 10 GeV with canonical properties, the
largest optical depth we find is $\tau_e \lesssim 10^{-7}$ for massive isolated
subhalos hosting intermediate-mass black holes. We conclude that dark matter
annihilation or decay on the Galactic scale cannot lead to significant

furthermore show that the non-linear (second order) contribution can be
estimated either analytically or numerically, yielding readily applicable
optimization algorithms. We demonstrate monotonic convergence for an
optimization functional that is an eighth-degree polynomial in the states. For
the 'standard' quantum control problem of a convex final-time functional,
linear equations of motion and linear dependency of the Hamiltonian on the
field, the second-order contribution is not required for monotonic convergence
but can be used to speed up convergence. We demonstrate this by comparing the

find numerical evidence that complex bags with positive and negative weights

bags almost cancel each other, we suggest that eliminating them from the

function suffers only from a mild sign problem. We also find a simpler model

prominent galaxy filament at the redshift of the z=0.027 X-ray absorption line

comparable to the size of WHIM filaments seen in cosmological simulations. No
individual galaxies fall within 350 projected kpc so it is unlikely that the
absorption is associated with gas in a galaxy halo or outflow. Another,
lower-significance X-ray absorption system was reported in the same Chandra
spectrum at z=0.011, but the large-scale structure in its vicinity is far
weaker and may be a spurious alignment. By searching for similar galaxy
structures in 140 random smoothed SDSS fields, we estimate a ~5-10% probability
of the z=0.027 absorber-filament alignment occurring by chance. If these two

coincidence between large-scale galaxy structure and a blind X-ray WHIM

six spectral bands ranging from the near-ultraviolet atmospheric cutoff to the

and distinctive portal connecting the visible sector to any hidden sector which
contains a singlet chiral superfield. In the presence of singlet kinetic
mixing, the hidden sector automatically acquires a light mass scale in the
range 0.1 - 100 GeV induced by electroweak symmetry breaking. In theories with
R-parity conservation, superparticles produced at the LHC invariably cascade
decay into hidden sector particles. Since the hidden sector singlet couples to
the visible sector via the Higgs sector, these cascades necessarily produce a
Higgs boson in an order 0.01 - 1 fraction of events. Furthermore,
supersymmetric cascades typically produce highly boosted, low-mass hidden

in a long-extinct ancestor species of yeast? Who were the central players in
the Last.fm social network 3 years ago? Our ability to answer such questions
has been limited by the unavailability of past versions of networks. To
overcome these limitations, we propose several algorithms for reconstructing a
network's history of growth given only the network as it exists today and a
generative model by which the network is believed to have evolved. Our
likelihood-based method finds a probable previous state of the network by
reversing the forward growth model. This approach retains node identities so
that the history of individual nodes can be tracked. We apply these algorithms
to uncover older, non-extant biological and social networks believed to have
grown via several models, including duplication-mutation with complementarity,
forest fire, and preferential attachment. Through experiments on both synthetic
and real-world data, we find that our algorithms can estimate node arrival
times, identify anchor nodes from which new nodes copy links, and can reveal
significant features of networks that have long since disappeared.

assumptions are, on one hand, upper bounds on the null curvature of the

deformation tensors of the foliation. Our proof is inspired by techniques from
Riemannian geometry, and it should be noted that we impose no restriction on
the size of the curvature or deformation tensors, and allow for metrics that
are ""far"" from the Minkowski one. The relevance of our estimate is illustrated
with a class of plane-symmetric spacetimes which satisfy our assumptions but
admit no uniform lower bound on the curvature not even in the L2 norm. The
conditions we put forward, therefore, lead to a uniform control of the
spacetime geometry and should be useful in the context of general relativity.

diffusion indeed increases the accuracy of sensing for both the glutamate AMPA

propose that the difference in accuracy of sensing of the two receptors can be
linked to their different roles in neurotransmission. Specifically, the high
accuracy in sensing glutamate is essential for the AMPA receptor to start
membrane depolarization, while the NMDA receptor is believed to work in a
second stage as a coincidence detector, involved in long-term potentiation and

may be the best local example of a nuclear starburst caused by bar-mediated
secular evolution. We present Palomar J and Pa beta images, VLA maps from
20-1.3cm, a Keck LWS image at 11.7mic and OVRO CO(1-0) and ^13CO(1-0), and 2.7
mm continuum images. The J-band image shows a symmetric barred spiral. Two
bright, compact mid-IR/radio sources in the nucleus comprise a starburst that
is equivalent to 10^5 O7 stars, probably a pair of young super star clusters
separated by 30pc. The nuclear starburst is forming stars at the rate of
~12Msun/yr, half of the total star formation rate for the galaxy of ~25Msun/yr.
IRAS04296 is bright in CO, and among the most gas-rich galaxies in the local
universe. The CO luminosity of the inner half kpc is equivalent to that of the
entire Milky Way. While the most intense CO emission extends over a 15""(2 kpc)
region, the nuclear starburst is confined to ~1-2""(150-250 pc) of the dynamical
center. From ^13CO, we find that the CO conversion factor in the nucleus is
higher than the Galactic value by a factor 3-4, typical of gas-rich spiral
nuclei. The nuclear star formation efficiency is M_gas/SFR^nuc = 2.7x10^-8
yr^-1, corresponding to gas consumption timescale, tau_SF^nuc~4x10^7 yrs. The
star formation efficiency is ten times lower in the disk, tau_SF^disk~3.3x10^8
yrs. The low absolute star formation efficiency in the disk implies that the
molecular gas is not completely consumed before it drifts into the nucleus, and
is capable of fueling a sustained nuclear starburst. IRAS04296 is beginning a
100Myr period as a LIRG, during which it will turn much of its 6x10^9Msun of
molecular gas into a nuclear cluster of stars. (abridged)

emission follows the general X-ray morphology but extends even farther from the
nucleus. The upper limit to the isotropic radio luminosity, ~2E24 W/Hz, places
the source in the Fanaroff-Riley 1 (FR 1) class, as expected for BL Lac
objects. The spectral energy distribution indicates that the extended X-ray
emission is from inverse Compton scattering of cosmic microwave background
photons. In this case, the derived magnetic field is B ~ 5 microGauss, the
minimum electron energy is 7-40 m_e c^2, and the Doppler factor is delta ~ 8 in
a knot 8"" from the nucleus. The minimum total kinetic power of the jet is
1-2E45 erg/s. Upstream of the bend, the width of the X-ray emission in the jet
is about half the projected distance from the nucleus. This implies that the
highly relativistic bulk motion is not limited to an extremely thin spine, as
has been proposed previously for FR 1 sources. The bending of the jet, the
deceleration of the flow from parsec to kiloparsec scales, and the knotty

constraints that can achieve considerably stronger pruning than arc
consistency. However, existing maxRRC algorithms suffer from overheads and
redundancies as they can repeatedly perform many constraint checks without
triggering any value deletions. In this paper we propose techniques that can
boost the performance of maxRPC algorithms. These include the combined use of
two data structures to avoid many redundant constraint checks, and heuristics
for the efficient ordering and execution of certain operations. Based on these,
we propose two closely related algorithms. The first one which is a maxRPC
algorithm with optimal O(end^3) time complexity, displays good performance when
used stand-alone, but is expensive to apply during search. The second one
approximates maxRPC and has O(en^2d^4) time complexity, but a restricted
version with O(end^4) complexity can be very efficient when used during search.
Both algorithms have O(ed) space complexity. Experimental results demonstrate
that the resulting methods constantly outperform previous algorithms for
maxRPC, often by large margins, and constitute a more than viable alternative
to arc consistency on many problems.

one of the dots (dot 1) is connected to external leads and the other (dot 2) is

conductance of such a system vanishes at a voltage located in-between the
energies of the bonding and the anti-bonding states, due to destructive
interference. When electron-phonon (e-ph) on the DQD is invoked, we find that,
at low temperatures, phonon emission taking place on dot 1 does not affect the
interference, while phonon emission from dot 2 suppresses it. The amount of
this suppression, as a function of the bias voltage, follows the effective e-ph
coupling reflecting the phonon density of states and can be used for phonon
spectroscopy.

large redshifts, we argue in this paper that the understanding of detailed
physical processes that drive HI evolution in galaxies is equally important.
Specifically, we focus on three open questions regarding the very first step in
the star-formation cycle in galaxies: How much do galaxy halos flavor and tax
the accretion flows that are postulated to bring fresh star-formation fuel to
galaxy disks? What are the basic properties of the warm neutral gas, the
progenitor of cold star-forming clouds? And, what are the origin and level of
interstellar inhomogeneities as seeding agents for molecule and star formation?
The very local Universe (The Milky Way and nearby galaxies) offers an
unparalleled high-resolution view for answering these questions and the
upcoming radio telescopes (e.g. EVLA, ASKAP, MeerKAT, ATA-256) promise great
advances.

construction of dynamical representations of the Poincar\'e group in all of
Dirac's forms of dynamics. The equivalence was established by Sokolov in the
context of proving that the equivalence holds for models that satisfy cluster
separability. The generalized Bakamjian Thomas construction is used in most
applications, even though it only satisfies cluster properties for systems of
less than four particles. Different forms of dynamics are related by unitary
transformations that remove interactions from some infinitesimal generators and
introduce them to other generators. These unitary transformation must be
interaction dependent, because they can be applied to a non-interacting
generator and produce an interacting generator. This suggests that these
transformations can generate complex many-body forces when used in many-body
problems. It turns out that this is not the case. In all cases of interest the
result of applying the unitary scattering equivalence results in
representations that have simple relations, even though the unitary
transformations are dynamical. This applies to many-body models as well as
models with particle production. In all cases no new many-body operators are
generated by the unitary scattering equivalences relating the different forms
of dynamics. This makes it clear that the various calculations used in
applications that emphasize one form of the dynamics over another are
equivalent. Furthermore, explicit representations of the equivalent dynamical
models in any form of dynamics are easily constructed. Where differences do
appear is when electromagnetic probes are treated in the one-photon exchange
approximation. This approximation is different in each of Dirac's forms of
dynamics.

Doppler-broadening of atomic transitions in $^{85}$Rb vapor. By using a
conventional platinum resistance thermometer and the Doppler thermometry
technique, we were able to determine $k_B$ with a relative uncertainty of
$4.1\times 10^{-4}$, and with a deviation of $2.7\times 10^{-4}$ from the
expected value. Our experiment, using an effusive vapour, departs significantly
from other Doppler-broadened thermometry (DBT) techniques, which rely on weakly
absorbing molecules in a diffusive regime. In these circumstances, very
different systematic effects such as magnetic sensitivity and optical pumping
are dominant. Using the model developed recently by Stace and Luiten, we
estimate the perturbation due to optical pumping of the measured $k_B$ value
was less than $4\times 10^{-6}$. The effects of optical pumping on atomic and
molecular DBT experiments is mapped over a wide range of beam size and
saturation intensity, indicating possible avenues for improvement. We also
compare the line-broadening mechanisms, windows of operation and detection
limits of some recent DBT experiments.

machine learning fall under the wide umbrella of the asymptotic minimization of
a sequence of non-negative, convex, and continuous functions. To incorporate
a-priori knowledge into the design, the asymptotic minimization task is usually
constrained on a fixed closed convex set, which is dictated by the available
a-priori information. To increase versatility towards the usage of the
available information, the present manuscript extends the Adaptive Projected
Subgradient Method (APSM) by introducing an algorithmic scheme which
incorporates a-priori knowledge in the design via a sequence of strongly
attracting quasi-nonexpansive mappings in a real Hilbert space. In such a way,
the benefits offered to online learning tasks by the proposed method unfold in
two ways: 1) the rich class of quasi-nonexpansive mappings provides a plethora
of ways to cast a-priori knowledge, and 2) by introducing a sequence of such
mappings, the proposed scheme is able to capture the time-varying nature of
a-priori information. The convergence properties of the algorithm are studied,
several special cases of the method with wide applicability are shown, and the
potential of the proposed scheme is demonstrated by considering an increasingly
important, nowadays, online sparse system/signal recovery task.

four years of the highest-precision data on 24 bright, stable stars from the

analysing an individual observed data set, as is demonstrated by the fact that
both techniques would detect the radial velocity signals announced as
exoplanets for the 61 Vir system in 50% of trials. There are modest differences
between the methods which can be recognised as arising from particular criteria
that they adopt. What both processes deliver is a quantitative selection
process such that one can use them to draw quantitative conclusions about
planetary frequency and orbital parameter distribution from a given data set.
Averaging over all 24 stars, in the period range P<300 days and the
eccentricity range 0.0<e<0.6, we could have detected 99% of planets with
velocity amplitudes K>7.1 m/s. For the best stars in the sample, we are able to
detect or exclude planets with K>3 m/s, corresponding to minimum masses of 8
M_earth (P=5 days) or 17 M_earth (P=50 days). Our results indicate that the
observed ""period valley,"" a lack of giant planets (M>100 M_earth) with periods
between 10-100 days, is indeed real. However, for planets in the mass range

considering in this background a probe D3 brane, which supports this theory
with SU(2) realized as Sp(1). Here we explicitly compute the non-perturbative
corrections to the D7/D3 system in type I' due to D-instantons. This
computation provides both the quartic effective action on the D7 branes and the
quadratic effective action on the D3 brane; the latter agrees with the

non-perturbative redefinition of the coupling constant. We also point out an
intriguing relation between the four-dimensional theory on the probe D3 brane,
which has a SO(8) flavor symmetry, and the eight-dimensional dynamics on the D7
branes. On the latter, SO(8) represents a gauge group and the flavor masses
correspond to the vacuum expectation values of an adjoint scalar field m: what

from its perturbative part by taking into account in its mass dependence the

kinetic mixing parameter between U(1)_X and U(1)_Y is predicted to be
\theta\sim 10^{-5}-10^{-6} after integrating out the messengers. Such a light
dark matter, which can have a normal relic density from the late decay of the

partial accomplished by training sequence-based linear channel estimation.
However, conventional linear estimation techniques neglect anticipated sparsity
of multipath channel and thus lead to low spectral efficiency which is scarce

We systematically investigate the influence of different initial conditions on

different density profiles (uniform, Bonnor-Ebert type, $\rho\propto r^{-1.5}$,
and $\rho\propto r^{-2}$), combined with six different supersonic turbulent
velocity fields (compressive, mixed, and solenoidal, initialised with two
different random seeds each) in three-dimensional simulations using the
adaptive-mesh refinement, hydrodynamics code FLASH. The simulations show that
density profiles with flat cores produce hundreds of low-mass stars, either
distributed throughout the entire cloud or found in subclusters, depending on
the initial turbulence. Concentrated density profiles always lead to the
formation of one high-mass star in the centre of the cloud and, if at all,
low-mass stars surrounding the central one. In uniform and Bonnor-Ebert type
density distributions, compressive initial turbulence leads to local collapse
about 25% earlier than solenoidal turbulence. However, central collapse in the
steep power-law profiles is too fast for the turbulence to have any significant
influence. We conclude that (I) the initial density profile and turbulence
mainly determine the cloud evolution and the formation of clusters, (II) the
initial mass function (IMF) is not universal for all setups, and (III) that
massive stars are much less likely to form in flat density distributions. The
IMFs obtained in the uniform and Bonnor-Ebert type density profiles are more
consistent with the observed IMF, but shifted to lower masses.

efficient photoluminescence from Si/SiO2 nanocrystals. While it is widely known
that only a minor portions of the nanocrystals in the samples contribute to the
observed photoluminescence, the high complexity of the Si/SiO2 interface and
the dramatic sensitivity to the fabrication conditions make the identification
of the most active structures at the experimental level not a trivial task.
Focusing on this aspect we have addressed the problem theoretically, by
calculating the radiative recombination rates for different classes of
Si-nanocrystals in the diameter range of 0.2-1.5 nm, in order to identify the
best conditions for optical emission. We show that the recombination rates of
hydrogenated nanocrystals follow the quantum confinement feature in which the
nanocrystal diameter is the principal quantity in determining the system
response. Interestingly, a completely different behavior emerges from the
OH-terminated or SiO2-embedded nanocrystals, where the number of oxygens at the
interface seems intimately connected to the recombination rates, resulting the
most important quantity for the characterization of the optical yield in such
systems. Besides, additional conditions for the achievement of high rates are
constituted by a high crystallinity of the nanocrystals and by high confinement
energies (small diameters).

embedded NCs, that contributes to determine the band gap value. By including
the strain on the hydroxided nanocrystals we are able to reproduce the
electronic and optical properties of the full Si/SiO2 systems. Moreover we
found that, while the quantum confinement dominates in the hydrogenated
nanocrystals of all sizes, the behaviour of hydroxided and embedded
nanocrystals strongly depends on the interface oxidation degree, in particular
for diameters below 2 nm. Here, the proportion of NC atoms at the Si/SiO2

Here we study the production of vorticity under idealized conditions when there
is rotation, shear, or baroclinicity, to address the problem of vorticity
generation in the interstellar medium in a systematic fashion. We use
three-dimensional periodic box numerical simulations to investigate the various
effects in isolation. We find that for slow rotation, vorticity production in
an isothermal gas is small in the sense that the ratio of the root-mean-square
values of vorticity and velocity is small compared with the wavenumber of the
energy-carrying motions. For Coriolis numbers above a certain level, vorticity
production saturates at a value where the aforementioned ratio becomes
comparable with the wavenumber of the energy-carrying motions. Shear also
raises the vorticity production, but no saturation is found. When the
assumption of isothermality is dropped, there is significant vorticity
production by the baroclinic term once the turbulence becomes supersonic. In
galaxies, shear and rotation are estimated to be insufficient to produce
significant amounts of vorticity, leaving therefore only the baroclinic term as
the most favorable candidate. We also demonstrate vorticity production visually
as a result of colliding shock fronts.

weighted towards massive stars out to z~2, and then evolves back towards its
present-day form by z~4 or so. We observe that this redshift trend mimics that
of the cosmic fraction of obscured star formation, perhaps hinting at a
physical connection. Such IMF evolution would concurrently go towards

single quantum mode and no Cooper pairs out of the condensate are assumed. Here
we discuss a mechanism by which the successful mode inhibits condensation in
neighboring modes and suppresses a creation of noncondensed Cooper pairs. It is
shown that condensed and noncondensed Cooper pairs are separated by an energy
gap which is smaller than the superconducting gap but large enough to prevent
nucleation in all other modes and to eliminate effects of noncondensed Cooper
pairs on properties of superconductors. Our result thus justifies basic
assumptions of the BCS theory and confirms that the BCS condensate is stable
with respect to two-particle excitations.

authentication protocol for low-cost RFID systems(UCS-RFID). The security of
the UCS-RFID relies on five dynamic secret keys which are updated at every
protocol run using a fresh random number (nonce) secretly transmitted from a
reader to tags. Our results show that, at the highest security level of the
protocol (security parameter= 256), inferring a nonce is feasible with the
probability of 0.99 by eavesdropping(observing) about 90 runs of the protocol.
Finding a nonce enable a passive attacker to recover all five secret keys of
the protocol. To do so, we propose a three-phase probabilistic approach in this
paper. Our attack recovers the secret keys with a probability that increases by
accessing to more protocol runs. We also show that tracing a tag using this
protocol is also possible even with less runs of the protocol.

realizes CPA is obtained by reversing the gain with absorption, and thus it
generally differs from the lasing medium. Here it is shown that a laser with an
optical medium that satisfies the parity-time $(\mathcal{PT})$ symmetry

outgoing coherent waves) and as a CPA (i.e. it can fully absorb incoming

thus referred to as a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric CPA-laser. The general
amplification/absorption features of the $\mathcal{PT}$ CPA-laser below lasing

of order three to ten minutes in coronal loops with TRACE and EIT (later with
EUVI and EIS), they have been almost universally interpreted as evidence for
propagating slow-mode magnetoacoustic (MA) waves in the low-beta coronal
environment. We show that this interpretation is not unique. We focus instead
on the ubiquitous faint upflows, associated with blue asymmetries of spectral
line profiles in footpoint regions of coronal loops, and as faint disturbances
propagating along coronal loops in EUV/XR imaging timeseries. The two scenarios
are difficult to differentiate using only imaging data, but careful analysis of
spectral line profiles indicates that faint upflows are likely responsible for
some of the observed quasi-periodic oscillatory signals in the corona. We show
that EIS measurements of intensity and velocity oscillations in coronal lines
(previously interpreted as direct evidence for propagating waves) are actually
accompanied by significant oscillations in the line width that are driven by a
quasi-periodically varying component of emission in the blue wing of the line.
The faint blue-shifted emission component quasi-periodically modulates the peak
intensity and line-centroid of a single Gaussian fit to the profile with the
same small amplitudes (respectively a few percent of background intensity, and
a few km/s) used to infer the presence of MA waves. Our results indicate that a
significant fraction of the quasi-periodicities observed with coronal imagers
and spectrographs, previously interpreted as propagating MA waves, are caused
by these upflows. The different physical cause for coronal oscillations would
significantly impact the prospects of successful coronal seismology using
propagating disturbances in coronal loops.

and $(\pi/2, \pi/2)$, respectively. In the channel of electron-hole excitations
we find universal behavior in B$_{2g}$ symmetry as long as the material
exhibits superconductivity at low temperature. In contrast, there is a strong
doping dependence in B$_{1g}$ symmetry: (i) In the doping range $0.20 \le p \le
0.25$ we observe rapid changes of shape and temperature dependence of the
spectra. (ii) In La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_4$ new structures appear for $x < 0.13$
which are superposed on the electron-hole continuum. The temperature dependence
as well as model calculations support an interpretation in terms of
charge-ordering fluctuations. For $x \le 0.05$ the response from fluctuations
disappears at B$_{1g}$ and appears at B$_{2g}$ symmetry in full agreement with
the orientation change of stripes found by neutron scattering. While, with a
grain of salt, the particle-hole continuum is universal for all cuprates the
response from fluctuating charge order in the range $0.05 \le p < 0.16$ is so
far found only in La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_4$. We conclude that
La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_4$ is close to static charge order and, for this reason,
may have a suppressed $T_c$.

energy American French Team (DAFT, in French FADA) has started a large project
to characterize statistically high redshift galaxy clusters, infer cosmological
constraints from Weak Lensing Tomography, and understand biases relevant for
constraining dark energy and cluster physics in future cluster and cosmological
experiments. The purpose of this paper is to establish the basis of reference
for the photo-z determination used in all our subsequent papers, including weak
lensing tomography studies. This project is based on a sample of 91 high
redshift (z>0.4), massive clusters with existing HST imaging, for which we are
presently performing complementary multi-wavelength imaging. This allows us in
particular to estimate spectral types and determine accurate photometric
redshifts for galaxies along the lines of sight to the first ten clusters for
which all the required data are available down to a limit of I_AB=24/24.5 with
the LePhare software. The accuracy in redshift is of the order of 0.05 for the
range 0.2<z<1.5. We verified that the technique applied to obtain photometric
redshifts works well by comparing our results to with previous works. In
clusters, photoz accuracy is degraded for bright absolute magnitudes and for
the latest and earliest type galaxies. The photoz accuracy also only slightly
varies as a function of the spectral type for field galaxies. As a consequence,
we find evidence for an environmental dependence of the photoz accuracy,
interpreted as the standard used Spectral Energy Distributions being not very
well suited to cluster galaxies. Finally, we modeled the LCDCS 0504 mass with
the strong arcs detected along this line of sight.

high intensity and small band width ($\le$ 0.1%) achievable via Compton
back-scattering off brilliant electron beams thus offering a promising
perspective to selectively populate these isomers with small separation
energies of 1 eV to a few keV. Similar to single-neutron halo states for very
light, extremely neutron-rich, radioactive nuclei
\cite{hansen95,tanihata96,aumann00}, the low neutron separation energy and
short-range nuclear force allows the neutron to tunnel far out into free space
much beyond the nuclear core radius. This results in prolonged half lives of
the isomers for the $\gamma$-decay back to the ground state in the 100
ps-$\mu$s range. Similar to the treatment of photodisintegration of the
deuteron, the neutron release from the neutron halo isomer via a second,
low-energy, intense photon beam has a known much larger cross section with a
typical energy threshold behavior. In the second step, the neutrons can be
released as a low-energy, pulsed, polarized neutron beam of high intensity and
high brilliance, possibly being much superior to presently existing beams from

certain closed subsets of stable sets in positive entropy systems are
investigated. It is showed that the topological pressure of any topological
system can be calculated in terms of the topological pressure of the preimages
of $\epsilon$-stable sets. For the constructed closed subset of the stable set
or the unstable set of any point in a measure-theoretic `rather big' set of a
topological system with positive entropy, especially for the weakly mixing
subset contained in the closure of stable set and unstable set, it is proved
that topological pressures of these subsets can be no less than the
measure-theoretic pressure.

crystal elastomer composed of chiral mesogens in the smectic A phase. X-ray
diffraction patterns of the elastomer collected over a range of orientations
with respect to the X-ray beam were used to reconstruct the three-dimensional
scattering intensity as a function of tensile strain. For the first time, we
show that the smectic domain order is preserved in these strained elastomers.
Changes in the intensity within a given scattering plane are due to
reorientation, and not loss, of the molecular order in directions orthogonal to
the applied strain. Incorporating the physical parameters of the elastomer, a
nonlinear elastic model is presented to describe the rotation of the
smectic-layered domains under strain, thus providing a fundamental analysis to
the mechanical response of these unique materials.

provide proof that these assumptions do not correspond to reality, and that
therefore the conclusion of the paper is misleading.
