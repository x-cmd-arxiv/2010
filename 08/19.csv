strategic properties of cryptographic protocols. However, due to the presence
of computationally-bounded players and the asymptotic nature of cryptographic
security, a definition of sequential rationality for this setting has thus far
eluded researchers.
  We propose a new framework for overcoming these obstacles, and provide the
first definitions of computational solution concepts that guarantee sequential
rationality. We argue that natural computational variants of subgame perfection
are too strong for cryptographic protocols. As an alternative, we introduce a
weakening called threat-free Nash equilibrium that is more permissive but still
eliminates the undesirable ``empty threats'' of non-sequential solution
concepts.
  To demonstrate the applicability of our framework, we revisit the problem of
implementing a mediator for correlated equilibria (Dodis-Halevi-Rabin,
Crypto'00), and propose a variant of their protocol that is sequentially
rational for a non-trivial class of correlated equilibria. Our treatment
provides a better understanding of the conditions under which mediators in a
correlated equilibrium can be replaced by a stable protocol.

can be applied to estimate the spatial electron-hole spacing inside the quantum

degeneracies of the electron excited (P and D) states, thus affecting
polarization alignment of wave function lobes for III-V Heterostructures such

crucial importance of piezoelectricity to resolve the symmetries and energies

$V_{x}$ to each space time point $x.$ For each $x$ the field $\psi$ takes
values $\psi(x)$ in $V_{x}.$ The freedom to choose a basis in each $V_{x}$
introduces gauge group operators and their Lie algebra representations to
define parallel transformations between vector spaces. This paper is an
exploration of the extension of these ideas to include the underlying scalar
complex number fields. Here a Hilbert space, $\bar{H}_{x},$ as an example of
$V_{x},$ and a complex number field, $C_{x},$ are associated with each space
time point. The freedom to choose a basis in $H_{x}$ is expanded to include the
freedom to choose complex number fields. This expansion is based on the
discovery that there exist representations of complex (and other) number
systems that differ by arbitrary scale factors. Compensating changes must be
made in the basic field operations so that the relevant axioms are satisfied.
This results in the presence of a new real valued gauge field $\vec{A}(x).$
Inclusion of $\vec{A}(x)$ into covariant derivatives in Lagrangians results in
the description of $\vec{A}(x)$ as a gauge boson that can have mass. The great
accuracy of QED suggests that the coupling constant of $\vec{A}(x)$ to matter
fields is very small compared to the fine structure constant. Other physical
properties of $\vec{A}(x)$ are not known at present.

time-series observations in a single photometric bandpass. Utilizing the damped
random walk model of Kelly et al. (2009), we parameterize the ensemble quasar
structure function in Sloan Stripe 82 as a function of observed brightness. The
ensemble model fit can then be evaluated rigorously for and calibrated with
individual light curves with no parameter fitting. This yields a classification
in two statistics --- one describing the fit confidence and one describing the
probability of a false alarm --- which can be tuned, a priori, to achieve high
quasar detection fractions (99% completeness with default cuts), given an
acceptable rate of false alarms. We establish the typical rate of false alarms
due to known variable stars as <3% (high purity). Applying the classification,
we increase the sample of potential quasars relative to those known in Stripe
82 by as much as 29%, and by nearly a factor of two in the redshift range
2.5<z<3, where selection by color is extremeley inefficient. This represents
1875 new quasars in a 290 deg^2 field. The observed rates of both quasars and
stars agree well with the model predictions, with >99% of quasars exhibiting
the expected variability profile. We discus the utility of the method at
high-redshift and in the regime of noisy and sparse data. Our time series
selection complements well independent selection based on quasar colors and has
strong potential for identifying high redshift quasars for BAO and other
cosmology studies in the LSST era.

theories in classical propositional logic and their collections of models. The
theories can be seen as presentations of Boolean algebras, and the collections
of models can be topologized in such a way that the theory can be recovered
from its space of models. The situation can be cast as a formal duality
relating two categories of syntax and semantics, mediated by homming into a
common dualizing object, in this case 2. In the present work, we generalize the
entire arrangement from propositional to first-order logic. Boolean algebras
are replaced by Boolean categories presented by theories in first-order logic,
and spaces of models are replaced by topological groupoids of models and their
isomorphisms. A duality between the resulting categories of syntax and
semantics, expressed first in the form of a contravariant adjunction, is
established by homming into a common dualizing object, now $\Sets$, regarded
once as a boolean category, and once as a groupoid equipped with an intrinsic
topology. The overall framework of our investigation is provided by topos
theory. Direct proofs of the main results are given, but the specialist will
recognize toposophical ideas in the background. Indeed, the duality between
syntax and semantics is really a manifestation of that between algebra and
geometry in the two directions of the geometric morphisms that lurk behind our
formal theory. Along the way, we construct the classifying topos of a decidable
coherent theory out of its groupoid of models via a simplified covering theorem
for coherent toposes.

spin axis away from the disc angular momentum axis toward the perpendicular

have their orbital axes misaligned with the stellar spin axis, even before any
additional planet-planet scatterings or Kozai interactions take place. In

young stellar objects (MYSOs) and ultra compact (UC) HII regions from a sample
of ~2000 MSX and 2MASS colour selected sources. Using a recent catalogue of
molecular clouds derived from the Boston University-Five College Radio
Astronomy Observatory Galactic Ring Survey (GRS), and by applying a Galactic
scaleheight cut off of 120 pc, we solve the distance ambiguity for RMS sources
located within 18\degr < |l| > 54\degr. These two steps yield kinematic
distances to 291 sources out of a possible 326 located within the GRS longitude
range. Combining distances and integrated fluxes derived from spectral energy
distributions, we estimate luminosities to these sources and find that > 90%
are indicative of the presence of a massive star. We find the completeness
limit of our sample is ~10^4 Lsun, which corresponds to a zero age main
sequence (ZAMS) star with a mass of ~12 Msun. Selecting only these sources, we
construct a complete sample of 196 sources. Comparing the properties of the
sample of young massive stars with the general population, we find the
RMS-clouds are generally larger, more massive, and more turbulent. We examine
the distribution of this sub-sample with respect to the location of the spiral
arms and the Galactic bar and find them to be spatially correlated. We identify
three significant peaks in the source surface density at Galactocentric radii
of approximately 4, 6 and 8 kpc, which correspond to the proposed positions of
the Scutum, Sagittarius and Perseus spiral arms, respectively. Fitting a scale
height to the data we obtain an average value of ~29+-0.5 pc, which agrees well
with other reported values in the literature, however, we note a dependence of
the scale height on galactocentric radius with it increases from 30 pc to 45 pc
between 2.5 and 8.5 kpc.

fNL. In a model with M scalar fields, the number of numerical integrations
required to obtain solutions of these equations scales like O(M^3). The

formation rate of galaxies and the black hole accretion rate of their central
active nucleus. The accuracy of the conversion from line strengths to physical
properties depends upon the accuracy to which the lines can be corrected for
dust attenuation. For studies of single galaxies with normal amounts of dust,
most dust corrections result in the same derived properties within the errors.
However, for statistical studies of populations of galaxies, or for studies of
galaxies with higher dust contents such as might be found in some classes of
""transition"" galaxies, significant uncertainty arises from the dust attenuation
correction. We compare the strength of the predominantly unobscured mid-IR
[NeII]15.5um + [NeIII]12.8um emission lines to the optical H alpha emission
lines in four samples of galaxies: (i) ordinary star forming galaxies, (ii)
optically selected dusty galaxies, (iii) ULIRGs, (iv) Seyfert 2 galaxies. We
show that a single dust attenuation curve applied to all samples can correct H
alpha emission for dust attenuation to a factor better than 2. Similarly, we
compare mid-IR [OIV] and optical [OIII] luminosities to find that [OIII] can be
corrected to a factor better than 3. This shows that the total dust attenuation
suffered by the AGN narrow line region is not significantly different to that
suffered by the starforming HII regions in the galaxy. We provide explicit dust
attenuation corrections, together with errors, for [OII], [OIII] and H alpha.
The best-fit average attenuation curve is slightly greyer than the Milky-Way
extinction law, indicating either that external galaxies have slightly
different typical dust properties to the Milky Way, or that there is a
significant contribution from scattering. Finally, we uncover an intriguing
correlation between Silicate absorption and Balmer decrement.

anomalous when compared to most (about 85%) nearby solar twin stars. Compared
to its twins, the Sun exhibits a deficiency of refractory elements (those with
condensation temperatures Tc>900K) relative to volatiles (Tc<900K). This
finding is speculated to be a signature of the planet formation that occurred
more efficiently around the Sun compared with the majority of solar twins.
Furthermore, within this scenario, it seems more likely that the abundance
patterns found are specifically related to the formation of terrestrial
planets. In this work we analyze abundance results from six large independent
stellar abundance surveys to determine whether they confirm or reject this
observational finding. We show that the elemental abundances derived for solar
analogs in these six studies are consistent with the Tc trend suggested as a
planet formation signature. The same conclusion is reached when those results
are averaged heterogeneously. We also investigate the dependency of the
abundances with first ionization potential (FIP), which correlates well with
Tc. A trend with FIP would suggest a different origin for the abundance
patterns found, but we show that the correlation with Tc is statistically more
significant. We encourage similar investigations of metal-rich solar analogs
and late F-type dwarf stars, for which the hypothesis of a planet formation
signature in the elemental abundances makes very specific predictions. Finally,
we examine a recent paper that claims that the abundance patterns of two stars
hosting super-Earth like planets contradict the planet formation signature
hypothesis. Instead, we find that the chemical compositions of these two stars
are fully compatible with our hypothesis.

reactions according to a discretized small set of labels denoting different
levels of experimental evidence or model-based likelihood. Here, we propose a
computational network-based system of reaction scoring that exploits the
complex hierarchical structure and the statistical regularities of the
metabolic network as a bipartite graph. We use the example of Escherichia coli
metabolism to illustrate our methodology. Our model is adjusted to the

metabolite-reaction pairs and, after validation, we integrate individual link
information to assess the reliability of each reaction in probabilistic terms.
This network-based scoring system breaks the degeneracy of currently employed
scores, enables further confirmation of modeling results, uncovers very
specific reactions that could be functionally or evolutionary important, and
identifies prominent experimental targets for further verification. We foresee
a wide range of potential applications of our approach given the natural

cross correlating flux fluctuations from multiple spectral lines. If one can
fit and subtract away the continuum emission with a smooth function of
frequency, the remaining signal contains fluctuations of flux with frequency
and angle from line emitting galaxies. Over a particular small range of
observed frequencies, these fluctuations will originate from sources
corresponding to a series of different redshifts, one for each emission line.
It is possible to statistically isolate the fluctuations at a particular
redshift by cross correlating emission originating from the same redshift, but
in different emission lines. This technique will allow detection of clustering
fluctuations from the faintest galaxies which individually cannot be detected,
but which contribute substantially to the total signal due to their large
numbers. We describe these fluctuations quantitatively through the line cross
power spectrum. As an example of a particular application of this technique, we
calculate the signal-to-noise ratio for a measurement of the cross power
spectrum of the OI(63 micron) and OIII(52 micron) fine structure lines with the
proposed Space Infrared Telescope for Cosmology and Astrophysics. We find that
the cross power spectrum can be measured beyond a redshift of z=8. Such
observations could constrain the evolution of the metallicity, bias, and duty
cycle of faint galaxies at high redshifts and may also be sensitive to the
reionization history through its effect on the minimum mass of galaxies. As
another example, we consider the cross power spectrum of CO line emission
measured with a large ground based telescope like CCAT and 21-cm radiation
originating from hydrogen in galaxies after reionization with an interferometer
similar in scale to MWA, but optimized for post-reionization redshifts.

rest-frame far-infrared and sub-millimetre, from the lensed z=2.3
sub-millimetre galaxy SMM J2135-0102. We obtain very high signal-to-noise
detections of 11 transitions from 3 species and limits on a further 20
transitions from 9 species. We use the 12CO, [CI] and HCN line strengths to
investigate the gas mass, kinematic structure and interstellar medium (ISM)
chemistry, and find strong evidence for a two-phase medium comprising a hot,
dense, luminous component and an underlying extended cool, low-excitation
massive component. Employing photo-dissociation region models we show that on
average the molecular gas is exposed to a UV radiation field that is ~1000 x
more intense than the Milky Way, with star-forming regions having a
characteristic density of n~10^4 /cm^3. These conditions are similar to those
found in local ULIRGs and in the central regions of typical starburst galaxies,
even though the star formation rate is far higher in this system. The 12CO
spectral line energy distribution and line profiles give strong evidence that
the system comprises multiple kinematic components with different conditions,
including temperature, and line ratios suggestive of high cosmic ray flux
within clouds. We show that, when integrated over the galaxy, the gas and
star-formation surface densities appear to follow the Kennicutt-Schmidt
relation, although when compared to high-resolution sub-mm imaging, our data
suggest that this relation breaks down on scales of <100pc. By virtue of the
lens amplification, these observations uncover a wealth of information on the
star formation and ISM at z~2.3 at a level of detail that has only recently
become possible at z<0.1, and show the potential physical properties that will
be studied in unlensed galaxies when ALMA is in full operation. (Abridged).

The unprecedented resolution and sensitivity of the GALFA-HI survey have

would be willing to participate in cooperative communication, especially if
their desired Quality-of- Service (QoS) is achievable via direct transmission.
An incentivebased auction mechanism is presented to induce cooperative behavior
in wireless networks with emphasis on users with asymmetrical channel fading
conditions. A single-object secondprice auction is studied for cooperative
partner selection in singlecarrier networks. In addition, a multiple-object
bundled auction is analyzed for the selection of multiple simultaneous partners
in a cooperative orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) setting. For
both cases, we characterize equilibrium outage probability performance, seller
revenue, and feedback bounds. The auction-based partner selection allows
winning bidders to achieve their desired QoS while compensating the seller who
assists them. At the local level sellers aim for revenue maximization, while
connections are drawn to min-max fairness at the network level. The proposed
strategies for partner selection in self-configuring cooperative wireless
networks are shown to be robust under conditions of uncertainty in the number
of users requesting cooperation, as well as minimal topology and channel link

the $a_i$'s, the mean and the variance of the numbers of summands for integers
in $[H_{n}, H_{n+1})$ are of size $n$, and the distribution of the numbers of
summands converges to a Gaussian as $n$ goes to the infinity. Previous
approaches used number theory or ergodic theory. We convert the problem to a
combinatorial one. In addition to re-deriving these results, our method
generalizes to a multitude of other problems (in the sequel paper \cite{BM} we
show how this perspective allows us to determine the distribution of gaps
between summands in decompositions). For example, it is known that every
integer can be written uniquely as a sum of the $\pm F_n$'s, such that every
two terms of the same (opposite) sign differ in index by at least 4 (3). The
presence of negative summands introduces complications and features not seen in
previous problems. We prove that the distribution of the numbers of positive
and negative summands converges to a bivariate normal with computable, negative
correlation, namely $-(21-2\phi)/(29+2\phi) \approx -0.551058$.

a sum of non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers. Once this has been shown, it's
natural to ask how many summands are needed. Using a continued fraction
approach, Lekkerkerker proved that the average number of such summands needed
for integers in $[F_n, F_{n+1})$ is $n / (\varphi^2 + 1) + O(1)$, where
$\varphi = \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}2$ is the golden mean. Surprisingly, no one appears
to have investigated the distribution of the number of summands; our main
result is that this converges to a Gaussian as $n\to\infty$. Moreover, such a
result holds not just for the Fibonacci numbers but many other problems, such
as linear recurrence relation with non-negative integer coefficients (which is
a generalization of base $B$ expansions of numbers) and far-difference
representations.
  In general the proofs involve adopting a combinatorial viewpoint and
analyzing the resulting generating functions through partial fraction
expansions and differentiating identities. The resulting arguments become quite
technical; the purpose of this paper is to concentrate on the special and most
interesting case of the Fibonacci numbers, where the obstructions vanish and
the proofs follow from some combinatorics and Stirling's formula; see [MW] for
proofs in the general case.

turns out to be a mapping cone as well, without any additional assumptions. The
main result of the paper is a characterization of cones with a mapping cone
symmetry, saying that a given map is an element of such cone if and only if the
composition of the map with the conjugate of an arbitrary element in the dual
cone is completely positive. A similar result was known in the case where the
map goes from an algebra of operators into itself and the cone is a symmetric
mapping cone. Our result is proved without the additional assumptions of
symmetry and equality between the domain and the target space. We show how it

piston-driven ejecta produced from a 15Msun and a 25Msun non-rotating
solar-metallicity star. The radial expansion of the gradually cooling
photosphere gives rise to a near-constant luminosity up to >~100d after
explosion. The photosphere remains in the outer 0.5Msun of the ejecta for up to
~50d after explosion. As the photosphere reaches the edge of the helium core,
the SN luminosity drops by an amount mitigated by the progenitor radius and the
56Ni mass. Synthetic light-curves exhibit a bell-shape morphology, evolving
faster for more compact progenitors, and with an earlier peak and narrower
width in bluer filters. UV and U-band fluxes are very sensitive to
line-blanketing, the metallicity, and the adopted model atoms. During the
recombination epoch synthetic spectra are dominated by HI and metal lines, and
are largely insensitive to the differing H/He/C/N/O composition of our two
progenitor stars. In contrast, synthetic nebular-phase spectra reveal a
broader/stronger OI doublet line in the higher-mass progenitor model,
reflecting the larger masses of oxygen and nickel that are ejected. Our
simulations overestimate the typical luminosity and the visual rise time of
standard SNe II-P, likely a consequence of our progenitor stars being too big
and/or too hydrogen rich. Comparison of our simulations with photospheric-phase
observations of SN1999em of the same color are satisfactory. Our neglect of
non-thermal processes leads to a fast disappearance of continuum radiation and
Balmer-line emission at the end of the plateau phase. With the exception of HI
lines, our nebular spectra show a striking similarity to contemporaneous
observations of SN1999em.

initial state radiative (ISR) correction and energy spread effect. Using the
generalized linear regression approach, a complex energy-dependent factor is

calculation of the q-dependent phonon spectral function using an improved
exact-diagonalization technique, defined over a variational Hilbert space. We
perform a comprehensive study of the low-energy excitations of the polaron.
Beside the energy range, where the additional phonon excitation is unbound, we
observe separate coherent peaks which correspond to bound and antibound states
of a polaron and additional phonon quanta. These novel states can be observed
for intermediate and strong electron-phonon coupling strengths, as well as
below and above the unbound one-phonon excitation spectrum. A detailed
investigation of their properties is presented. We find good agreement between
the phonon spectral function obtained from the first-order strong-coupling
perturbation theory and numerical results.

results for the same problem in the whole space. The approach is particularly
suitable for proving new results in strong norms. To determine whether this
extension is available, turns out to be a simple exercise. The verification
depends on a few general features of the functional space X related to the
space variables. Hence, we present an approach as much as possible independent
of the particular space X. We appeal to a reflection technique. Hence a crucial
assumption is to be in the presence of flat boundaries (see below). Instead of
stating ""general theorems"" we rather prefer to illustrate how to apply our
results by considering a couple of interesting problems. As a main example, we
show that the resolution of a class of problems for the evolution Navier-Stokes
equations under a slip boundary condition can be reduced to that of the
corresponding results for the Cauchy problem. In particular, we show that sharp
vanishing viscosity limit results that hold for the evolution Navier-Stokes

noise. We study the noise to determine when this method becomes competitive
with the Sequential Propagator Method, and find that for any practical
calculation it is competitive with or superior to the Sequential Propagator
Method. We also examine a second stochastic method, the so-called ``one-end
trick"", concluding it is relatively inefficient in this context. The
investigation is carried out on two gauge field ensembles, using the
non-perturbatively improved Wilson-Sheikholeslami-Wohlert action with N_f=2
mass-degenerate sea quarks. The two ensembles have similar lattice spacings but
different sea quark masses. We use the first stochastic method to extract
${\mathcal O}(a)$-improved, matched lattice results for the semileptonic form
factors on the ensemble with lighter sea quarks, extracting f_+(0).

transmits to multiple destinations with the help of a relay, in the limit of a
large bandwidth. We address the problem of optimal relay positioning and power
allocations at source and relay, to maximize the multicast rate from source to
all destinations. To solve such a network planning problem, we develop a
three-faceted approach based on an underlying information theoretic model,
computational geometric aspects, and network optimization tools. Firstly,
assuming superposition coding and frequency division between the source and the
relay, the information theoretic framework yields a hypergraph model of the
wideband BRC, which captures the dependency of achievable rate-tuples on the
network topology. As the relay position varies, so does the set of hyperarcs
constituting the hypergraph, rendering the combinatorial nature of optimization
problem. We show that the convex hull C of all nodes in the 2-D plane can be
divided into disjoint regions corresponding to distinct hyperarcs sets. These
sets are obtained by superimposing all k-th order Voronoi tessellation of C. We
propose an easy and efficient algorithm to compute all hyperarc sets, and prove
they are polynomially bounded. Using the switched hypergraph approach, we model
the original problem as a continuous yet non-convex network optimization
program. Ultimately, availing on the techniques of geometric programming and
$p$-norm surrogate approximation, we derive a good convex approximation. We
provide a detailed characterization of the problem for collinearly located
destinations, and then give a generalization for arbitrarily located
destinations. Finally, we show strong gains for the optimal relay positioning

prove the generalized mass action law together with the basic relations between

In this work, the consequences of modified hyperscaling are analyzed in detail.
The most striking outcome is that the free energy cost \Delta F of interface
formation at the critical point is no longer a universal constant, but instead
increases as a power law with system size, \Delta F proportional to $L^\theta$,
with $\theta$ the violation of hyperscaling critical exponent, and L the linear

of this mechanism largely depends on the presence of both nitrogen and oxygen.
But experiments show that streamer propagation is amazingly robust against
changes of the gas composition; even for pure nitrogen with impurity levels
below 1 ppm streamers propagate essentially with the same velocity as in air,
but their minimal diameter is smaller, and they branch more frequently.
Additionally, they move more in a zigzag fashion and sometimes exhibit a
feathery structure. In our simulations, we test the relative importance of
photo-ionization and of the background ionization from pulsed repetitive
discharges, in air as well as in nitrogen with 1 ppm O2 . We also test
reasonable parameter changes of the photo-ionization model. We find that photo-
ionization dominates streamer propagation in air for repetition frequencies of
at least 1 kHz, while in nitrogen with 1 ppm O2 the effect of the repetition

heating because it implements only the functions that have one-to-one mapping

one of the promising research directions in low power dissipating circuit
design in the past few years and has found its application in low power CMOS
design, digital signal processing and nanotechnology. This paper presents the
efficient approaches for designing reversible fast adders that implement carry
look-ahead and carry-skip logic. The proposed 16-bit high speed reversible
adder will include IG gates for the realization of its basic building block.
The IG gate is universal in the sense that it can be used to synthesize any
arbitrary Boolean-functions. The IG gate is parity preserving, that is, the
parity of the inputs matches the parity of the outputs. It allows any fault
that affects no more than a single signal readily detectable at the circuit's
primary outputs. Therefore, the proposed high speed adders will have the
inherent opportunity of detecting errors in its output side. It has also been
demonstrated that the proposed design offers less hardware complexity and is
efficient in terms of gate count, garbage outputs and constant inputs than the

(BHs) in massive gas-rich galaxies by means of high-resolution hydrodynamical
simulations. We find that the presence of a massive gaseous disc allows
recoiled BHs to return to the centre on a much shorter timescale than for
purely stellar discs. Also, BH accretion and feedback can strongly modify the
orbit of recoiled BHs and hence their return timescale, besides affecting the
distribution of gas and stars in the galactic centre. However, the dynamical
interaction of kicked BHs with the surrounding medium is in general complex and
can facilitate both a fast return to the centre as well as a significant delay.
The Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion rates of the recoiling BHs in our simulated
galaxies are favourably high for the detection of off-centred AGN if kicked
within gas-rich discs -- up to a few per cent of the Eddington accretion rate
-- and are highly variable on timescales of a few 10^7 yrs. In major merger
simulations of gas-rich galaxies, we find that gravitational recoils increase
the scatter in the BH mass -- host galaxy relationships compared to simulations
without kicks, with the BH mass being more sensitive to recoil kicks than the
bulge mass. A generic result of our numerical models is that the clumpy massive
discs suggested by recent high-redshift observations, as well as the remnants
of gas-rich mergers, exhibit a gravitational potential that falls steeply in
the central regions, due to the dissipative concentration of baryons. As a
result, supermassive BHs should only rarely be able to escape from massive
galaxies at high redshifts, which is the epoch where the bulk of BH recoils is
expected to occur.[Abridged]

interestingness measures, which quantify the novelty or unexpectedness of a
pattern when contrasted with any prior information of the data miner
(Silberschatz and Tuzhilin, 1995; Geng and Hamilton, 2006). A key challenge
here is the formalization of this prior information in a way that lends itself
to the definition of an interestingness subjective measure that is both
meaningful and practical.
  In this paper, we outline a general strategy of how this could be achieved,
before working out the details for a use case that is important in its own
right.
  Our general strategy is based on considering prior information as constraints
on a probabilistic model representing the uncertainty about the data. More
specifically, we represent the prior information by the maximum entropy
(MaxEnt) distribution subject to these constraints. We briefly outline various
measures that could subsequently be used to contrast patterns with this MaxEnt
model, thus quantifying their subjective interestingness.

results indicate that the spin of small body should be considered in

is clear that when the direction of spin axes is the same as the orbitally
angular momentum (""positive"" spin), spin can decrease the energy fluxes which
radiate to infinity. For antidirection spin (""negative""), the energy fluxes to
infinity can be enlarged. And the relations between fluxes (both infinity and
horizon) and spin look like quadratic functions. From frequency shift due to
spin, we estimate the wave-phase accumulation during the inspiraling process of
the particle. We find that the time of particle inspiral into the black hole is
longer for positive spin and shorter for negative compared with the nonspinning
particle. Especially, for extreme spin value, the energy radiation near the
horizon of the extreme Kerr black hole is much more than that for the
nonspinning one. And consequently, the maximum binging energy of the extreme
spinning particle is much larger than that of the nonspinning particle.

(AFD) order in Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) phases of strontium titanate,
Sr$_{1+n}$Ti$_n$O$_{3n+1}$, as a function of both compressive epitaxial strain
and phase number $n$. We find all RP phases to exhibit AFD order under a
significant range of strains, recovering the bulk AFD order as $\sim 1/n^2$. A
Ginzburg-Landau Hamiltonian generalized to include inter-octahedral
interactions reproduces our {\em ab initio} results well, opening a pathway to
understanding other nanostructured perovskite systems.

dimensions. A generalization of Snyder's noncommutative (Euclidean) space
allows the inclusion of the generator of dilations into the defining algebra of
the coordinate and rotation operators. We then construct a spherically
symmetric noncommutative Laplacian on this space having the correct limiting
spectrum. This is presented via a creation and annihilation operator
realization of the algebra, which may lend itself to a truncation of the
Hilbert space.

In the
history of science, this is the first time we have discovered a new way in
which (transverse) waves are realized in nature. It can therefore be expected
to lead to important changes in the perspective about the nature of light or
radiation. Then, we point out that the null result of the Michelson-Morley
experiment is a natural and straightforward consequence of light being an
emission wave. Concepts of special relativity, of length contraction and of
time dilation, are not required for this explanation, however.

another numerical method which is different from the equation proposed by
Planck to predict blackbody radiation by frequency. Firstly, Maxwell
distribution function for molecule velocities was modified, resulting in a
distribution function with three parameters for deriving monochromatic
intensity of blackbody radiation through frequency. Then this simulation
function was applied to estimate the energy density (Jm-2) of blackbody
radiation by frequency at 5500 K, 5000 K, 4500 K, 4000 K, 3500 K and 2.73 K of
temperature. The results of density simulated by means of distribution function
suggested in this paper agree well with the experimental data. All of the
correlation coefficients between actual and calculated data are 1.0; at the
same time, the mean relative errors are less than 6.65% in total.
