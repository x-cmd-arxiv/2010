fluctuations and last at least long enough to think a few thoughts. In many
scenarios involving universes of infinite size or duration, Boltzmann brains
are infinitely more common than human beings who arise in the ordinary way.
Thus we should expect to be Boltzmann brains, in contradiction to observation.
We discuss here the question of whether Boltzmann brains can arise as quantum
fluctuations in the vacuum. Such Boltzmann brains pose an even worse problem
than those arising as fluctuations in the thermal state of an exponentially
expanding universe. We give several arguments for and against inclusion of
vacuum Boltzmann brains in the anthropic reference class, but find neither
choice entirely satisfactory.

purpose of this paper is to provide data and tools in order to predict in
advance how Gaia photometry is expected to be. To do so, we provide
relationships among colours involving Gaia magnitudes and colours from other
commonly used photometric systems (Johnson-Cousins, SDSS, Hipparcos and Tycho).
The most up-to-date information from industrial partners has been used to
define the nominal passbands and based on the BaSeL3.1 stellar spectral energy
distribution library, relationships were obtained for stars with different
reddening values, ranges of temperatures, surface gravities and metallicities.
The transformations involving Gaia and Johnson-Cousins V-I_C and Sloan DSS g-z
colours have the lowest residuals. A polynomial expression for the relation
between the effective temperature and the colour G_BP-G_RP was derived for
stars with T > 4500 K. Transformations involving two Johnson or two Sloan DSS
colours yield lower residuals than using only one colour. We also computed
several ratios of total-to-selective absorption including absorption A_G in the
G band and colour excess E(G_BP-G_RP) for our sample stars. A relationship,
involving A_G/A_V and the intrinsic (V-I_C) colour, is provided. The derived
Gaia passbands have been used to compute tracks and isochrones using the Padova
and BASTI models. Finally, the performances of the predicted Gaia magnitudes
have been estimated according to the magnitude and the celestial coordinates of
the star. The provided dependencies among colours can be used for planning
scientific exploitation of Gaia data, performing simulations of the Gaia-like
sky, planning ground-based complementary observations and for building
catalogues with auxiliary data for the Gaia data processing and validation.

This is so in spite of the invariance of MI under reparametrizations, because
linear correlations are not invariant under them. The simplest bounds are
obtained for Gaussians, but the most interesting ones for practical purposes
are obtained for uniform marginal distributions. The latter can be enforced in
general by using the ranks of the individual variables instead of their actual
values, in which case one obtains bounds on MI in terms of Spearman correlation
coefficients. We show with gene expression data that these bounds are in
general non-trivial, and the degree of their (non-)saturation yields valuable

hypercube. Submodular functions come up in a variety of applications in
combinatorial optimization. For a vast range of algorithms, the existence of an
oracle to a submodular function is assumed. But how does one check if this
oracle indeed represents a submodular function?
  Consider a function f:{0,1}^n \rightarrow R. The distance to submodularity is
the minimum fraction of values of $f$ that need to be modified to make f
submodular. If this distance is more than epsilon > 0, then we say that f is
epsilon-far from being submodular. The aim is to have an efficient procedure
that, given input f that is epsilon-far from being submodular, certifies that f
is not submodular. We analyze a very natural tester for this problem, and prove
that it runs in subexponential time. This gives the first non-trivial tester
for submodularity. On the other hand, we prove an interesting lower bound (that
is, unfortunately, quite far from the upper bound) suggesting that this tester
cannot be very efficient in terms of epsilon. This involves non-trivial
examples of functions which are far from submodular and yet do not exhibit too
many local violations.
  We also provide some constructions indicating the difficulty in designing a
tester for submodularity. We construct a partial function defined on
exponentially many points that cannot be extended to a submodular function, but

the Universe is that an observer could potentially detect multiple images of
radiating sources. In particular, a non-trivial topology will generate pairs of
correlated circles of temperature fluctuations in the anisotropies maps of the
cosmic microwave background (CMB), the so-called circles-in-the-sky. In this
way, a detectable non-trivial spatial topology may be seen as an observable
attribute, which can be probed through the circles-in-the-sky for all locally
homogeneous and isotropic universes with no assumptions on the cosmological
dark energy (DE) equation of state (EOS) parameters. We show that the knowledge
of the spatial topology through the circles-in-the-sky offers an effective way
of reducing the degeneracies in the DE EOS parameters. We concretely illustrate
the topological role by assuming, as an exanple, a Poincar\'{e} dodecahedral
space topology and reanalyzing the constraints on the parameters of a specific
EOS which arise from the supernovae type Ia, baryon acoustic oscillations and
the CMB plus the statistical topological contribution.

particles are usually well described by the Maxey-Riley (MR) equation. The most
time-consuming contribution in the MR equation is the Basset history force
which is a well-known problem for many-particle simulations in turbulence. In
this paper a novel numerical approach is proposed for the computation of the
Basset history force based on the use of exponential functions to approximate
the tail of the Basset force kernel. Typically, this approach not only
decreases the cpu time and memory requirements for the Basset force computation
by more than an order of magnitude, but also increases the accuracy by an order
of magnitude. The method has a temporal accuracy of O(Delta t^2) which is a
substantial improvement compared to methods available in the literature.
Furthermore, the method is partially implicit in order to increase stability of
the computation. Traditional methods for the calculation of the Basset history
force can influence statistical properties of the particles in isotropic
turbulence, which is due to the error made by approximating the Basset force
and the limited number of particles that can be tracked with classical methods.
The new method turns out to provide more reliable statistical data.

demonstrate how the viscosity theory framework in [Jakobsen, 2006] can be
applied to this setting to derive upper and lower bounds on the value. In a
small extension to [Bensoussan & Lions, 1982], we derive weak convergence rates

identification of underspread linear systems (ULSs), whose responses lie within
a unit-area region in the delay Doppler space, by probing them with a known
input signal. It is shown that sufficiently-underspread parametric linear
systems, described by a finite set of delays and Doppler-shifts, are
identifiable from a single observation as long as the time bandwidth product of
the input signal is proportional to the square of the total number of delay
Doppler pairs in the system. In addition, an algorithm is developed that
enables identification of parametric ULSs from an input train of pulses in
polynomial time by exploiting recent results on sub-Nyquist sampling for time
delay estimation and classical results on recovery of frequencies from a sum of
complex exponentials. Finally, application of these results to super-resolution
target detection using radar is discussed. Specifically, it is shown that the
proposed procedure allows to distinguish between multiple targets with very
close proximity in the delay Doppler space, resulting in a resolution that
substantially exceeds that of standard matched-filtering based techniques

dwarfs in the Kepler Quarter 1 long cadence data. We have identified 373
flaring stars, some of which flare multiple times during the observation
period. We calculate relative flare energies, flare rates and durations, and
compare these with the quiescent photometric variability of our sample. We find
that M dwarfs tend to flare more frequently but for shorter durations than K
dwarfs, and that they emit more energy relative to their quiescent luminosity
in a given flare than K dwarfs. Stars that are more photometrically variable in
quiescence tend to emit relatively more energy during flares, but variability
is only weakly correlated with flare frequency. We estimate distances for our
sample of flare stars and find that the flaring fraction agrees well with other
observations of flare statistics for stars within 300 pc above the Galactic
Plane. These observations provide a more rounded view of stellar flares by
sampling stars that have not been pre-selected by their activity, and are
informative for understanding the influence of these flares on planetary
habitability.

the cold molecular gas is distributed along two curved gas lanes about 1 kpc
north and south of the active nucleus, coincident with the circumnuclear dust
ring noted by previous authors. These CO arcs lie within the Inner Lindblad
Resonance of the large scale oval bar and have kinematics consistent with those

the southern gas lane and one lying ~600 pc north of the nucleus. Closer to the

near-IR H2 line emission arises. This suggests that the H2 line emission is not
a good indicator for a cold gas reservoir in NGC4151 and that the H2 is likely

the early universe, from which the present-day massive galaxies and galaxy
clusters formed. While overdensities of star-forming galaxies have been found
around QSOs at 2<z<5, the case for excess galaxy clustering around QSOs at z>6
is less clear. Previous studies with HST have reported the detection of small
excesses of faint dropout galaxies in some QSO fields, but these surveys probed
a relatively small region surrounding the QSOs. To overcome this problem, we
have observed the most distant QSO at z=6.4 using the large field of view of
the Suprime-Cam (34' x 27'). Newly-installed CCDs allowed us to select Lyman
break galaxies (LBG) at z~6.4 more efficiently. We found seven LBGs in the QSO
field, whereas only one exists in a comparison field. The significance of this
apparent excess is difficult to quantify without spectroscopic confirmation and
additional control fields. The Poisson probability to find seven objects when
one expects four is ~10%, while the probability to find seven objects in one
field and only one in the other is less than 0.4%, suggesting that the QSO
field is significantly overdense relative to the control field. We find some
evidence that the LBGs are distributed in a ring-like shape centered on the QSO
with a radius of ~3 Mpc. There are no candidate LBGs within 2 Mpc from the QSO,
i.e., galaxies are clustered around the QSO but appear to avoid the very
center. These results suggest that the QSO is embedded in an overdense region
when defined on a sufficiently large scale. This suggests that the QSO was
indeed born in a massive halo. The central deficit of galaxies may indicate
that (1) the strong UV radiation from the QSO suppressed galaxy formation in
its vicinity, or (2) that star-formation closest to the QSO occurs mostly in an
obscured mode that is missed by our UV selection.

sky survey in 6 IR bands (9, 18, 65, 90, 140, and 160um) with 3-10 times better
sensitivity than IRAS, covering the crucial far-IR wavelengths across the peak
of the dust emission. Combined with a better spatial resolution, AKARI can much
more precisely measure the total infrared luminosity (L_TIR) of individual
galaxies, and thus, the total infrared luminosity density in the local
Universe. By fitting IR SED models, we have re-measured L_TIR of the IRAS
Revised Bright Galaxy Sample. We present mid-IR monochromatic luminosity to
L_TIR conversions for Spitzer 8,24um, AKARI 9,18um, IRAS 12um, WISE 12,22um,
and ISO 15um filters, with scatter ranging 13-44%. The resulting AKARI IR
luminosity function (LF) agrees well with that from the IRAS. We integrate the
LF weighted by L_TIR to obtain a cosmic IR luminosity density of Omega_TIR=
(8.5^{+1.5}_{-2.3})x 10^7 L Mpc^-3, of which 7+-1% is produced by LIRGs, and
only 0.4+-0.1% is from ULIRGs in the local Universe. Once IR contributions from
AGN and star-forming galaxies (SFG) are separated, SFG IR LF shows a steep
decline at the bright-end. Compared with high-redshift results from the AKARI
NEP deep survey, these data show a strong evolution of Omega_TIRSF propto
(1+z)^4.0+-0.5, and Omega_TIRAGN propto (1+z)^4.4+-0.4. For Omega_TIRAGN, the
ULIRG contribution exceeds that from LIRG already by z~1. A rapid evolution in
both Omega_TIRAGN and Omega_TIRSFG suggests the correlation between star
formation and black hole accretion rate continues up to higher redshifts. We
compare the evolution of Omega_TIRAGN to that of X-ray luminosity density. The
Omega_TIRAGN/Omega_X-rayAGN ratio shows a possible increase at z>1, suggesting
an increase of obscured AGN at z>1.

diffusion is only along a given direction, does not ensure that the numerically
calculated heat fluxes are in the correct direction. This can lead to negative
temperatures for the anisotropic thermal diffusion equation. In a previous
paper we proposed a monotonicity-preserving explicit method which uses limiters
(analogous to those used in the solution of hyperbolic equations) to
interpolate the temperature gradients at cell faces. However, being explicit,
this method was limited by a restrictive Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL)
stability timestep. Here we propose a fast, conservative, directionally-split,
semi-implicit method which is second order accurate in space, is stable for
large timesteps, and is easy to implement in parallel. Although not strictly
monotonicity-preserving, our method gives only small amplitude temperature
oscillations at large temperature gradients, and the oscillations are damped in
time. With numerical experiments we show that our semi-implicit method can
achieve large speed-ups compared to the explicit method, without seriously
violating the monotonicity constraint. This method can also be applied to
isotropic diffusion, both on regular and distorted meshes.

years after the expected dispersal of the protoplanetary disc. Theoretical
models of planet formation suggest that this peak in the mid-infrared emission
could be due to the formation of Pluto-sized bodies in the disc, which ignite
the collisional cascade and enhance the production of small dust. Here we
present resolved mid-infrared imaging of the disc of HD191089 (F5V in the BPMG)
and consider its implications for the state of planet formation in this system.
HD191089 was observed at 18.3 microns using T-ReCS on Gemini South and the
images were compared to models of the disc to constrain the radial distribution
of the dust. The emission observed at 18.3 microns is shown to be significantly
extended beyond the PSF at a position angle of 80 degrees. This is the first
time dust emission has been resolved around HD191089. Modelling indicates that
the emission arises from a dust belt from 28-90 AU, inclined at 35 degrees from
edge on with very little emission from the inner 28AU of the disc, indicating
the presence of an inner cavity. The steep slope of the inner edge is more
consistent with truncation by a planet than with ongoing stirring. A tentative
brightness asymmetry F(W)/F(E)=0.80+/-0.12 (1.8 sigma) between the two sides of

order to delineate regions of the infrared two colour plane (K - [8] versus K -
[24]) that correspond to discs in different evolutionary stages. This provides
a ready tool for classifying the nature of star-disc systems based on infrared
photometry. In particular we demonstrate the distinct loci followed by discs
that undergo `uniform draining' (reduction in surface density by a spatially
uniform factor) from those that clear from the inside out. We draw attention to
the absence of objects on this `draining locus' in those star forming regions
where the 24um sensitivity would permit their detection, as compared with the
~20 objects in these regions with colours suggestive of inner holes. We thus
conclude that discs predominantly clear from the inside out. We also apply our
classification of the infrared two colour plane to stars of spectral type M3-M5
in the IC 348 cluster and show that some of its members (dubbed `weak excess'
sources by Muzerolle et al 2010) that had previously been assumed to be in a
state of clearing are instead likely to be optically thick discs in which the
dust is well settled towards the mid-plane. Nevertheless, there are many discs
in a state of partial clearing in IC 348, with their abundance (relative to the
total population of disc bearing stars) being around four times higher than for
comparable stars in Taurus. However, the number of partially cleared discs
relative to the total number of late type stars is similarly low in both
regions (10 and 20 % respectively). We therefore conclude that IC 348
represents a more evolved version of the Taurus population (with more of its
discs being highly settled or partially cleared) but that the timescale for
clearing is similarly short (a few times 10^5 years) in both cases.

hole-doped cuprates can be strongly suppressed at the so-called magic doping
fractions. Despite great research efforts, the origin of the `magic doping'
remains mysterious. Recently, we have developed a real-space theory of
high-temperature superconductivity which reveals the intrinsic relationship
between the localized Cooper pair and the localized hole pair
(arXiv:1007.3536). Here we report that the theory can naturally explain the
emergence of non-superconducting checkerboard phases and the magic doping
problem in hole-doped cuprate superconductors. It clearly shows that there
exist only seven `magic numbers' in the cuprate family at $x=$1/18, 1/16, 2/25,
1/9, 1/8, 2/9 and 1/4 with 6a*6a, 4a*4a, 5a*5a, 3a*3a, 4a*4a, 3a*3a and 2a*2a
checkerboard patterns, respectively. Moreover, our framework leads directly to
a satisfactory explanation of the most recent discovery [M. J. Lawler, et al.
Nature 466, 347 (2010)] of the symmetries broken within each copper-oxide unit
in hole-doped cuprate superconductors. These findings may shed new light on the

requires new exotic fields which play an important role in solving flavor

molecular cloud is investigated from the prestellar stage resolving both the
molecular cloud core and the protostar itself. In the collapsing cloud, the
first adiabatic core appears prior to the protostar formation. Reflecting the
thermodynamics of the collapsing gas, the first core is much more massive than
the protostar. When the molecular cloud has no angular momentum, the first core
falls onto the protostar and disappears a few years after the protostar
formation. On the other hand, when the molecular cloud has an angular momentum,
the first core does not disappear even after the protostar formation, and
directly evolves into the circumstellar disk with a Keplerian rotation. There
are two paths for the formation of the circumstellar disk. When the initial
cloud has a considerably small rotational energy, two nested disks appear just
after the protostar formation. During the early main accretion phase, the inner
disk increases its size and merges with the outer disk (i.e. first core) to
form a single circumstellar disk with a Keplerian rotation. On the other hand,
when the molecular cloud has a rotational energy comparable to observations, a
single Keplerian disk that corresponds to the first core already exists prior
to the protostar formation. In such a cloud, the first core density gradually
increases, maintaining the Keplerian rotation and forms the protostar inside
it. Thus, the protostar is born in the Keplerian disk. In other words, a
massive disk already exists before the protostar formation. In each case, the
protostar at its formation is already surrounded by a massive circumstellar
disk. The circumstellar disk is about 10-100 times more massive than the
protostar in the main accretion disk. Such disks are favourable sites for the
formation of binary companions and gas-giant planets.

the ATLASGAL survey at 870 micron to search for dense neutral material
collected on their borders. Results: We find that 86% of the bubbles contain
ionized gas detected by means of its radio-continuum emission at 20-cm. Thus,
most of the bubbles observed at 8.0 micron enclose HII regions ionized by O-B2
stars. Ninety-eight percent of the bubbles exhibit 24 micron emission in their
central regions. The ionized regions at the center of the 8.0 micron bubbles
seem to be devoid of PAHs but contain hot dust. Among the 65 regions for which
the angular resolution of the observations is high enough to resolve the
spatial distribution of cold dust at 870 micron, we find that 40% are
surrounded by cold dust, and that another 28% contain interacting
condensations. The former are good candidates for the collect and collapse
process, as they display an accumulation of dense material at their borders.
The latter are good candidates for the compression of pre-existing
condensations by the ionized gas. Eighteen bubbles exhibit associated
ultracompact HII regions and/or methanol masers in the direction of dust
condensations adjacent to their ionization fronts. Our results suggest that
more than a quarter of the bubbles may have triggered the formation of massive

adding the splitting angle statistic of SGL data, a consistent constraint is

secure in the presence of a quantum adversary - has generated elegant proposals
for new cryptosystems. Some of these systems are set in the random oracle model
and are proven secure relative to adversaries that have classical access to the
random oracle. We argue that to prove post-quantum security one needs to prove
security in the quantum-accessible random oracle model where the adversary can
query the random oracle with quantum states.
  We begin by separating the classical and quantum-accessible random oracle
models by presenting a scheme that is secure when the adversary is given
classical access to the random oracle, but is insecure when the adversary can
make quantum oracle queries. We then set out to develop generic conditions
under which a classical random oracle proof implies security in the
quantum-accessible random oracle model. We introduce the concept of a
history-free reduction which is a category of classical random oracle
reductions that basically determine oracle answers independently of the history
of previous queries, and we prove that such reductions imply security in the
quantum model. We then show that certain post-quantum proposals, including ones
based on lattices, can be proven secure using history-free reductions and are
therefore post-quantum secure. We conclude with a rich set of open problems in
this area.

penumbral filaments are presented. Time sequences of bright filaments show
overturning motions strikingly similar to those seen along the walls of small
isolated structures in the active regions. The filaments show outward
propagating striations with inclination angles suggesting that they are aligned
with the local magnetic field. We interpret it as the equivalent of the
striations seen in the walls of small isolated magnetic structures. Their
origin is then a corrugation of the boundary between an overturning convective
flow inside the filament and the magnetic field wrapping around it. The outward
propagation is a combination of a pattern motion due to the downflow observed
along the sides of bright filaments, and the Evershed flow. The observed short
wavelength of the striation argues against the existence of a dynamically
significant horizontal field inside the bright filaments. Its intensity
contrast is explained by the same physical effect that causes the dark cores of
filaments, light bridges and `canals'. In this way striation represents an
important clue to the physics of penumbral structure and its relation with
other magnetic structures on the solar surface. We put this in perspective with
results from the recent 3-D radiative hydrodynamic simulations.

to the precession rate of the small-eccentricity orbits of a particle of mass
$m$ moving around a Schwarzschild black hole of mass ${\mathsf M}\gg m$.
Specifically, we study the gauge-invariant function $\rho(x)$, where $\rho$ is
defined as the $O(m)$ part of the dimensionless ratio
$(\hat\Omega_r/\hat\Omega_{\varphi})^2$ between the squares of the radial and
azimuthal frequencies of the orbit, and where $x=[Gc^{-3}({\mathsf

dimensionless gravitational potential (mass over radius) associated with the
mean circular orbit. Our GSF computation of the function $\rho(x)$ in the
interval $0<x\leq 1/6$ determines, for the first time, the {\em strong-field
behavior} of a combination of two of the basic functions entering the Effective
One Body (EOB) description of the conservative dynamics of binary systems. We
show that our results agree well in the weak-field regime (small $x$) with the
3rd post-Newtonian (PN) expansion of the EOB results, and that this agreement
is improved when taking into account the analytic values of some of the
logarithmic-running terms occurring at higher PN orders. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that GSF data give access to higher-order PN terms of $\rho(x)$ and
can be used to set useful new constraints on the values of yet-undetermined EOB
parameters. Most significantly, we observe that an {\em excellent global

paramount importance in the evolution of short-period CVs. Observed donors are
oversized in comparison with those of isolated single stars of the same mass,
which is thought to be a consequence of the mass loss. Using the empirical
mass-radius relation of CVs and the homologous approximation for changes in
effective temperature T_2, orbital period P, and luminosity of the donor with
the stellar radius, we find the semi-empirical mass-loss rate M2_dot of CVs as
a function of P. The derived M2_dot is at ~10^(-9.5)-10^(-10) Msun/yr and
depends weakly on P when P > 90 min, while it declines very rapidly towards the
minimum period when P < 90 min, emulating the P-T_2 relation. Due to strong
deviation from thermal equilibrium caused by the mass loss, the semi-empirical
M2_dot is significantly different from, and has a less-pronounced turnaround
behavior with P than suggested by previous numerical models. The semi-empirical
P-M2_dot relation is consistent with the angular momentum loss due to
gravitational wave emission, and strongly suggests that CV secondaries with
0.075 Msun < M_2 < 0.2 Msun are less than 2 Gyrs old. When applied to selected
eclipsing CVs, our semi-empirical mass-loss rates are in good agreement with
the accretion rates derived from the effective temperatures T_1 of white
dwarfs, suggesting that M2_dot can be used to reliably infer T_2 from T_1.
Based on the semi-empirical M2_dot, SDSS 1501 and 1433 systems that were
previously identified as post-bounce CVs have yet to reach the minimal period.

clustered star formation in such parsec-scale dense clumps with emphasis on the
role of magnetic fields. The simulations have shown that magnetic fields tend
to slow down global gravitational collapse and thus star formation, especially
in the presence of protostellar outflow feedback. Even a relatively weak can
retard star formation significantly, because the field is amplified by
supersonic turbulence to an equipartition strength. However, in such a case,
the distorted field component dominates the uniform one. In contrast, if the
field is moderately strong, the uniform component remains dominant. Such a
difference in the magnetic structure is observed in simulated polarization maps
of dust thermal emission. Recent polarization measurements show that the field
lines in nearby cluster-forming clumps are spatially well-ordered, indicative
of a rather strong field. In such strongly-magnetized clumps, star formation
should proceed relatively slowly; it continues for at least several global
free-fall times of the parent dense clump ($t_{\rm ff}\sim $ a few $\times
10^5$ yr).

employed in the keystream generator is done through an information theoretical
approach. We show that with the aid of a dedicated wire-tap encoder, the amount
of uncertainty that the adversary must face about the secret key given all the

mount, is a decreasing function of the sample available for cryptanalysis. This
means that the wire-tap encoder can indeed provide an information theoretical

normal incidence airborne sound transmission loss of the double panel
structure, without structure-borne connections, is written in terms of three
main contributions; (i) sound transmission loss of the panels, (ii) sound
transmission loss of the blanket and (iii) sound absorption due to multiple
reflections inside the cavity. The method is applied to four different blankets
frequently used in automotive and aeronautic applications: a non-symmetric
multilayer made of a screen in sandwich between two porous layers and three
symmetric porous layers having different pore geometries. It is shown that the
absorption behavior of the blanket controls the acoustic behavior of the

for the given term order as the maximal degree of the reduced Gr\""{o}bner
basis. It is well-known that the degree complexity with respect to the graded
reverse lexicographic order is equal to the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity
(\cite{BS}). However, little is known about the degree complexity with respect
to the graded lexicographic order (\cite{A}, \cite{CS}).
  In this paper, we study the degree complexity of a smooth irreducible surface
in $\p^4$ with respect to the graded lexicographic order and its geometric
meaning. Interestingly, this complexity is closely related to the invariants of
the double curve of a surface under the generic projection.
  As results, we prove that except a few cases, the degree complexity of a
smooth surface $S$ of degree $d$ with $h^0(\mathcal I_S(2))\neq 0$ in $\p^4$ is
given by $2+\binom{\deg Y_1(S)-1}{2}-\rho_{a}(Y_{1}(S))$, where $Y_1(S)$ is a
double curve of degree $\binom{d-1}{2}-\rho_{a}(S \cap H)$ under a generic
projection of $S$ (Theorem \ref{mainthm2}). Exceptional cases are either a
rational normal scroll or a complete intersection surface of $(2,2)$-type or a
Castelnuovo surface of degree 5 in $\p^4$ whose degree complexities are in fact
equal to their degrees. This complexity can also be expressed only in terms of
the maximal degree of defining equations of $I_S$ (Corollary \ref{cor:01} and
\ref{cor:02}).

captured an unusual flare at 3 mm, which peaked at an observed max flux of 0.5
Jy (about 27x the quiescent value). Here we present follow-up mm observations
that demonstrate a periodicity to the phenomenon. While monitoring 3 new
periastron encounters, we detect flares within 17.5 hrs (or 4.6%) of the
orbital phase of the first reported flare, and we constrain the main emitting
region to a stellar height of 3.7-6.8 Rstar. The recorded activity is
consistent with the proposed picture for synchrotron emission initiated by a
magnetic reconnection event when the two stellar magnetospheres of the highly
eccentric (e=0.556) binary are believed to collide near periastron as the stars
approach a minimum separation of 8 Rstar (~13 Rsolar). The similar light curve
decay profiles allow us to estimate an average flare duration of 30 hrs.
Assuming one mm flare per orbit, DQ Tau could spend approximately 8% of its
15.8-d orbital period in an elevated flux state. Our analysis of the mm
emission provides an upper limit of 5% on the linear polarization. We discuss
the extent to which a severely entangled magnetic field structure and Faraday
rotation effects are likely to reduce the observed polarization fraction. We
also predict that, for the current picture, the stellar magnetospheres must be
misaligned at a significant angle or, alternatively, that the topologies of the
outer magnetospheres are poorly described by a well-ordered dipole inside a
radius of 7 Rstar. Finally, to investigate whether reorganization of the
magnetic field during the interaction affects mass accretion, we also present
simultaneous optical (VRI) monitoring, as an established tracer of accretion
activity in this system. We find that an accretion event can occur coincident
in both time and duration with the synchrotron fallout of a magnetic
reconnection event.

For abelian extensions $F / K$ with an arbitrary totally real base field $K$

(the analogue of Stickelberger's theorem) is not proved yet at that level of
generality. In this paper, we construct a general Stickelberger splitting map

49 long slit observations were divided into 99 smaller samples, which have
allowed determinations of the amount of extinction, extinction corrected
\Hbeta\ surface brightness, electron temperatures (from [S~II], [N~II], and
[O~III]), and electron densities (from [S~II] and [Cl~III]) throughout much of
this complex region.
  We verify an earlier conclusion from a radio/optical study that beyond about
5\arcmin\ from \ori\ local emission begins to be contaminated by scattering of
light from the much brighter central Huygens Region of M~42 and this scattered
light component becomes dominant at large distances. This contamination means
that the derived properties for the outer regions are not accurate. From
comparison of the light from the dominant star in M~43 with the continuum of
that nebula (which is almost entirely scattered star light) it is determined
that scattered light is enhanced in the blue, which can lead to observed Balmer
line ratios that are theoretically impossible and erroneous electron
temperatures.
  This blue scattering of emission-lines is important even in the Huygens
Region because it means that at anything except very high spectroscopic
resolution the observed lines are a blend of the original and scattered light,
with shorter wavelength lines being artificially enhanced. This can lead to
over-estimates of the electron temperatures derived from the nebular and
auroral line ratios of forbidden lines. This phenomenon is probably applicable
to many other H~II regions.

was proposed by Lancichinetti, Fortunato, and Kertesz (LFK) last year. The LFK
algorithm constructs natural communities of (in principle) all nodes of a graph
by maximising the local fitness of communities. The resulting modules can
overlap. The generation of communities can easily be repeated for many values
of resolution; thus allowing different views on the network at different
resolutions. We implemented the main idea of the LFK algorithm---to generate
natural communities of each node of a network---in a different way. We start
with a value of the resolution parameter that is high enough for each node to
be its own natural community. As soon as the resolution is reduced, each node
acquires other nodes as members of its community, i.e. natural communities
grow. For each community found at a certain resolution level we calculate the
next lower resolution where a node is added. After adding a node to a community
of a seed node we check whether it is also the natural community of a node that
we have already analysed. In this case, we can stop expanding the seed node's
community. We tested our algorithm on a small benchmark graph and on a network
of about 500 papers in information science (weighted with the Salton index of
bibliographic coupling). In our tests, this approach results in characteristic
ranges of resolution where a large resolution change does not lead to a growth
of the natural community. Such stable modules were also obtained by applying
the LFK algorithm but since we determine communities for all resolution values
in one run, our approach is faster than the LFK reference. And our algorithm
reveals the hierarchical structure of the graph more easily.

physical qubit transport mechanism in solid-state quantum computing
architectures. Although the mechanism can be implemented in either a chain of
quantum dots or donors, a 1D chain of donors in Si is of particular interest
due to the natural confining potential of donors that can in principle help
reduce the gate densities in solid-state quantum computing architectures. Using
detailed atomistic modeling, we investigate CTAP in a more realistic triple
donor system in the presence of inevitable fabrication imperfections. In
particular, we investigate how an adiabatic pathway for CTAP is affected by
donor misplacements, and propose schemes to correct for such errors. We also
investigate the sensitivity of the adiabatic path to gate voltage fluctuations.
The tight-binding based atomistic treatment of straggle used here may benefit
understanding of other donor nanostructures, such as donor-based charge and
spin qubits. Finally, we derive an effective 3 \times 3 model of CTAP that
accurately resembles the voltage tuned lowest energy states of the
multi-million atom tight-binding simulations, and provides a translation
between intensive atomistic Hamiltonians and simplified effective Hamiltonians
while retaining the relevant atomic-scale information. This method can help
characterize multi-donor experimental structures quickly and accurately even in

  processing","23 pages, 4 figures",,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For the filtering of peaks in periodic signals, we specify polynomial filters
that are optimally localized in space. The space localization of functions
having an expansion in terms of orthogonal polynomials is thereby measured by a
generalized mean value. Solving an optimization problem including this mean
value, we determine those polynomials out of a polynomial space that are
optimally localized. We give explicit formulas for these optimally space
localized polynomials and determine in the case of the Jacobi polynomials the
relation of the generalized mean value to the position variance of a well-known
uncertainty principle. Further, we will consider the Hermite polynomials as an
example on how to get optimally space localized polynomials in a non-compact
setting. Finally, we investigate how the obtained optimal polynomials can be
applied as filters in signal processing.
