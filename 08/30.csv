The second subject, Smooth Particle Applied Mechanics or ""SPAM"", provides a
particle method, resembling molecular dynamics, but designed to solve continuum
problems. The numerical work is simplified because the SPAM particles obey
ordinary, rather than partial, differential equations. The interpolation method
used with SPAM is a powerful interpretive tool converting point particle

vital to the study and understanding of the third research topic we discuss,
strong shockwaves in dense fluids. Such shockwaves exhibit stationary

mechanics. The SPAM interpolation method, applied to this molecular dynamics
problem, clearly demonstrates both the tensor character of kinetic temperature
and the time-delayed response of stress and heat flux to the strain rate and
temperature gradients. The dynamic Lyapunov instability of the shockwave
problem can be analyzed in a variety of ways, both with and without symmetry in
time. These three subjects suggest many topics suitable for graduate research
in nonlinear nonequilibrium problems.

generated in this picture by writhe and self-intersection of the vortex

condensation of planet-mass H-4He gas clouds in trillion-planet clumps is set
at 300,000 yr (0.3My) following the onset of plasma instabilities when ambient
temperatures were >1000K. Eventual collapse of the planet-cloud into a solid
structure takes place against the background of an expanding universe with
declining ambient temperatures. Stars form from planet mergers within the
clumps and die by supernovae on overeating of planets. For planets produced by
stars, isothermal free fall collapse occurs initially via quasi equilibrium
polytropes until opacity sets in due to molecule and dust formation. The
contracting cooling cloud is a venue for molecule formation and the sequential
condensation of solid particles, starting from mineral grains at high
temperatures to ice particles at lower temperatures, water-ice becomes
thermodynamically stable between 7 and 15 My after the initial onset of
collapse, and contraction to form a solid icy core begins shortly thereafter.
Primordial-clump-planets are separated by ~ 1000 AU, reflecting the high
density of the universe at 30,000 yr. Exchanges of materials, organic molecules
and evolving templates readily occur, providing optimal conditions for an
initial origin of life in hot primordial gas planet water cores when adequately
fertilized by stardust. The condensation of solid molecular hydrogen as an
extended outer crust takes place much later in the collapse history of the
protoplanet. When the object has shrunk to several times the radius of Jupiter,
the hydrogen partial pressure exceeds the saturation vapour pressure of solid
hydrogen at the ambient temperature and condensation occurs.

stochastic system, its relative entropy $D$ evolves in accordance with the
second law of thermodynamics; its absolute entropy $H$ may also be so, provided
that the stochastic perturbation is additive and the flow of the vector field
is nondivergent. For a deterministic system, $dH/dt$ is equal to the
mathematical expectation of the divergence of the flow (a result obtained
before), and, remarkably, $dD/dt = 0$. That is to say, relative entropy is
always conserved. So, for a nonlinear system, though the trajectories of the
state variables, say $\ve x$, may appear chaotic in the phase space, say
$\Omega$, those of the density function $\rho(\ve x)$ in the new ``phase

India, in 2001) survive and grow after incubation for periods of up to two
hours at 121 oC . Under these conditions daughter cells appear within the
original mother cells and the number of cells in the samples increases with
length of exposure to 121 oC. No such increase in cells occurs at room
temperature, suggesting that the increase in daughter cells is brought about by
exposure of the Red Rain cells to high temperatures. This is an independent
confirmation of results reported earlier by two of the present authors,
claiming that the cells can replicate under high pressure at temperatures up to
300 oC. The flourescence behaviour of the red cells is shown to be in
remarkable correspondence with the extended red emission observed in the Red
Rectangle planetary nebula and other galactic and extragalactic dust clouds,
suggesting, though not proving, an extraterrestrial origin.

description of the decoupling limit of N coincident D1-branes on a circle. It
has been proposed that at large N there is a phase transition at strong
coupling related to the Gregory-Laflamme (GL) phase transition in the
holographic gravity dual. In a high temperature limit there was argued to be a
deconfinement transition associated to the spatial Polyakov loop, and it has
been proposed that this is the continuation of the strong coupling GL
transition. Investigating the theory on the lattice for SU(3) and SU(4) and
studying the time and space Polyakov loops we find evidence supporting this. In
particular at strong coupling we see the transition has the parametric
dependence on coupling predicted by gravity. We estimate the GL phase
transition temperature from the lattice data which, interestingly, is not yet
known directly in the gravity dual. Fine tuning in the lattice theory is
avoided by the use of a lattice action with exact supersymmetry.

and excitons in coupled quantum wells (QW) embedded in an optical microcavity
is developed. It is shown that at low temperature an electron current induces
the (normal component) polariton flow, therefore, a transport of photons along
the cavity. However, the electron current dragged by the polariton flow is
strongly suppressed below polariton superfluid transition temperature and
hence, the strong suppression of the induced electron current indicates the
superfluidity of polaritons. Therefore, the transport properties of polaritons
can be investigated by measuring the current or voltage in the electron
subsystem. At high temperatures we study the exciton-electron drag effects. At
high temperatures regime, from one hand, the existence of the electric current
in an electron QW induces the exciton flow in the other QW, from the other
hand, the electron current in one QW induces the exciton flow in the other QW
via the drag of excitons by the electrons. The drag coefficients for the
polariton-electron systems are calculated and analyzed. We discuss the possible
experimental observation of the drag effects in the system of electrons and
microcavity polaritons, that also allow to observe the cavity polaritons

defined as families of permutations $(\sigma_N)_{N \geq 1}$, $\sigma_N$ in the

be deduced from the structure of $\sigma_{N+1}$ simply by removing the element
$N+1$. The virtual permutations, and in particular the probability measures on
the corresponding space which are invariant by conjugation, have been studied
in a details by Tsilevich. In the present article, we prove that for a large
class of such invariant measures (containing in particular the Ewens measure of
any parameter $\theta \geq 0$), it is possible to associate a flow
$(T^{\alpha})_{\alpha \in \mathbb{R}}$ of random operators on a suitable
functional space. Moreover, if $(\sigma_N)_{N \geq 1}$ is a random virtual
permutation following a distribution in the class described above, the operator
$T^{\alpha}$ can be interpreted as the limit, in a sense which has to be made
precise, of the permutation $\sigma_N^{\alpha_N}$, where $N$ goes to infinity

inquiry. The inference phase consists of selecting the most probable models
based on the available data; whereas the inquiry phase consists of using what
is known about the models to select the most relevant experiment. Optimizing
inquiry involves searching the parameterized space of experiments to select the
experiment that promises, on average, to be maximally informative. In the case
where it is important to learn about each of the model parameters, the
relevance of an experiment is quantified by Shannon entropy of the distribution
of experimental outcomes predicted by a probable set of models. If the set of
potential experiments is described by many parameters, we must search this
high-dimensional entropy space. Brute force search methods will be slow and
computationally expensive. We present an entropy-based search algorithm, called
nested entropy sampling, to select the most informative experiment for
efficient experimental design. This algorithm is inspired by Skilling's nested
sampling algorithm used in inference and borrows the concept of a rising
threshold while a set of experiment samples are maintained. We demonstrate that
this algorithm not only selects highly relevant experiments, but also is more
efficient than brute force search. Such entropic search techniques promise to
greatly benefit autonomous experimental design.

relating the color of the dye and its symmetric parents to its bond alternation
in the ground state and also to the dipole properties associated with its
low-lying charge-resonance (or charge-transfer) transition. We calibrate and
test these relationships on an array of different protonation states of the
green fluorescent protein chromophore motif (an asymmetric halochromic methine
dye) and its symmetric parent dyes. The relationships rely on the assumption
that the diabatic states that define the Platt model for methine dye color
[J.R. Platt, J. Chem. Phys. 25 80 (1956)] can also be distinguished by their
single-double bond alternation and by their charge localization character.
These assumptions are independent of the primary constraint that defines the
diabatic states in the Platt model - specifically, the Brooker deviation rule
for methine dyes [L.G.S. Brooker, Rev. Mod. Phys. 14 275 (1942)]. Taking these
assumptions, we show that the Platt model offers an alternate route to known
structure-property relationships between the bond length alternation and the
quadratic nonlinear polarizability {\beta}. We show also that the Platt model
can be parameterized without the need for synthesis of the symmetric parents of
a given dye, using dipole data obtained through spectroscopic measurements.
This suggests that the Platt model parameters may be used as independent
variables in free-energy relationships for chromophores whose symmetric parents
cannot be synthesized or chromophores strongly bound to biomolecular
environments. The latter category includes several recently characterized
biomolecular probe constructs. We illustrate these concepts by an analysis of
previously reported electroabsorption and second-harmonic generation
experiments on green fluorescent proteins.

to restrict connections within hidden layers. However, the resulting states of
hidden units exhibit statistical dependencies. Based on this observation, we
propose using $l_1/l_2$ regularization upon the activation possibilities of
hidden units in restricted Boltzmann machines to capture the loacal
dependencies among hidden units. This regularization not only encourages hidden
units of many groups to be inactive given observed data but also makes hidden
units within a group compete with each other for modeling observed data. Thus,
the $l_1/l_2$ regularization on RBMs yields sparsity at both the group and the
hidden unit levels. We call RBMs trained with the regularizer \emph{sparse
group} RBMs. The proposed sparse group RBMs are applied to three tasks:
modeling patches of natural images, modeling handwritten digits and pretaining
a deep networks for a classification task. Furthermore, we illustrate the
regularizer can also be applied to deep Boltzmann machines, which lead to
sparse group deep Boltzmann machines. When adapted to the MNIST data set, a
two-layer sparse group Boltzmann machine achieves an error rate of $0.84\%$,

so-called extended clusters observed in various Local Group galaxies, including
M31 and NGC6822. The N-body models incorporate a stellar mass function, stellar
evolution and the tidal field of a host galaxy. We find that extended clusters
can arise naturally within a weak tidal field provided that the tidal radius is
filled at the start of the evolution. Differences in the initial tidal
filling-factor can produce marked differences in the subsequent evolution of
clusters and the size-scales that would be observed. These differences are more
marked than any produced by internal evolution processes linked to the
properties of cluster binary stars or the action of an intermediate-mass black
hole, based on models performed in this work and previous work to date. Models
evolved in a stronger tidal field show that extended clusters cannot form and
evolve within the inner regions of a galaxy such as M31. Instead our results
support the suggestion many extended clusters found in large galaxies were
accreted as members of dwarf galaxies that were subsequently disrupted. Our
results also enhance the recent suggestion that star clusters evolve to a
common sequence in terms of their size and mass.

is crossed by at most one other edge. In this paper, we establish a local
property of 1-planar graphs which describes the structure in the neighborhood
of small vertices (i.e. vertices of degree no more than seven). Meanwhile, some
new classes of light graphs in 1-planar graphs with the bounded degree are
found. Therefore, two open problems presented by Fabrici and Madaras [The
structure of 1-planar graphs, Discrete Mathematics, 307, (2007), 854-865] are
solved. Furthermore, we prove that each 1-planar graph $G$ with maximum degree
$\Delta(G)$ is acyclically edge $L$-choosable where
$L=\max\{2\Delta(G)-2,\Delta(G)+83\}$.

distance scales and near event horizons. These arise from the conformal scalar
degrees of freedom in the extended effective field theory of gravity generated
by the trace anomaly of massless quantum fields in curved space. The origin of
these conformal scalar degrees of freedom as massless poles in two-particle
intermediate states of anomalous amplitudes in flat space is exposed. At event
horizons the conformal anomaly scalar degrees of freedom can have
macroscopically large effects on the geometry, potentially removing the
classical event horizon of black hole and cosmological spacetimes, replacing
them with a quantum boundary layer where the effective value of the
gravitational vacuum energy density can change. In the effective theory, the
cosmological term becomes a dynamical condensate, whose value depends upon
boundary conditions near the horizon. In the conformal phase where the anomaly
induced fluctutations dominate, and the condensate dissolves, the effective
cosmological ""constant"" is a running coupling which has an infrared stable
fixed point at zero. By taking a positive value in the interior of a fully
collapsed star, the effective cosmological term removes any singularity,
replacing it with a smooth dark energy interior. The resulting gravitational
condensate star configuration resolves all black hole paradoxes, and provides a
testable alternative to black holes as the final state of complete
gravitational collapse. The observed dark energy of our universe likewise may
be a macroscopic finite size effect whose value depends not on microphysics but
on the cosmological horizon scale.

deposition rates. However, the cool cores of galaxy clusters are continuously
heated by thermal conduction and turbulent heat diffusion due to minor mergers
or the galaxies orbiting the cluster center. These processes can either reduce
the energy requirements for AGN heating of cool cores, or they can prevent
overcooling altogether. We perform 3D MHD simulations including field-aligned
thermal conduction and self-gravitating particles to model this in detail.
Turbulence is not confined to the wakes of galaxies but is instead
volume-filling, due to the excitation of large-scale g-modes. We systematically
probe the parameter space of galaxy masses and numbers. For a wide range of
observationally motivated galaxy parameters, the magnetic field is randomized
by stirring motions, restoring the conductive heat flow to the core. The
cooling catastrophe either does not occur or it is sufficiently delayed to
allow the cluster to experience a major merger that could reset conditions in
the intracluster medium. Whilst dissipation of turbulent motions is negligible
as a heat source, turbulent heat diffusion is extremely important; it
predominates in the cluster center. However, thermal conduction becomes
important at larger radii, and simulations without thermal conduction suffer a
cooling catastrophe. Conduction is important both as a heat source and to
reduce stabilizing buoyancy forces, enabling more efficient diffusion.
Turbulence enables conduction, and conduction enables turbulence. In these
simulations, the gas vorticity---which is a good indicator of trapped
g-modes--increases with time. The vorticity growth is approximately mirrored by
the growth of the magnetic field, which is amplified by turbulence.

detection and symmetry breaking to eliminate symmetric parts of the search

symmetries of a logic program from the symmetries of the constructed coloured
graph. We also propose an encoding of symmetry-breaking constraints in terms of
permutation cycles and use only generators in this process which implicitly
represent symmetries and always with exponential compression. These ideas are
formulated as preprocessing and implemented in a completely automated flow that
first detects symmetries from a given answer set program, adds
symmetry-breaking constraints, and can be applied to any existing answer set
solver. We demonstrate computational impact on benchmarks versus direct
application of the solver.
  Furthermore, we explore symmetry breaking for answer set programming in two
domains: first, constraint answer set programming as a novel approach to
represent and solve constraint satisfaction problems, and second, distributed
nonmonotonic multi-context systems. In particular, we formulate a
translation-based approach to constraint answer set solving which allows for
the application of our symmetry detection and symmetry breaking methods. To
compare their performance with a-priori symmetry breaking techniques, we also
contribute a decomposition of the global value precedence constraint that
enforces domain consistency on the original constraint via the unit-propagation
of an answer set solver. We evaluate both options in an empirical analysis. In
the context of distributed nonmonotonic multi-context system, we develop an
algorithm for distributed symmetry detection and also carry over

structures on surfaces for which a local orthonormal frame is given by a Lie
bracket generating pair of vector fields that can become collinear.
Generically, there are three types of points: Riemannian points where the two
vector fields are linearly independent, Grushin points where the two vector
fields are collinear but their Lie bracket is not, and tangency points where
the two vector fields and their Lie bracket are collinear and the missing
direction is obtained with one more bracket. In this paper we consider the
problem of finding normal forms and functional invariants at each type of
point. We also require that functional invariants are ""complete"" in the sense
that they permit to recognize locally isometric structures. The problem happens
to be equivalent to the one of finding a smooth canonical parameterized curve
passing through the point and being transversal to the distribution. For
Riemannian points such that the gradient of the Gaussian curvature $K$ is
different from zero, we use the level set of $K$ as support of the
parameterized curve. For Riemannian points such that the gradient of the
curvature vanishes (and under additional generic conditions), we use a curve
which is found by looking for crests and valleys of the curvature. For Grushin
points we use the set where the vector fields are parallel. Tangency points are
the most complicated to deal with. The cut locus from the tangency point is not
a good candidate as canonical parameterized curve since it is known to be
non-smooth. Thus, we analyse the cut locus from the singular set and we prove
that it is not smooth either. A good candidate appears to be a curve which is
found by looking for crests and valleys of the Gaussian curvature. We prove
that the support of such a curve is uniquely determined and has a canonical
parametrization.

interesting possibilities for studies not yet possible at other wavelengths.
With the HST on the way to its retirement, 8m class telescopes will have the
task of bridging neutron star optical astronomy into a new era, characterised
by the advent of the generation of extremely large telescopes (ELTs), like the
European ELT (E-ELT). This will mark a major step forward in the field,
enabling one to identify many more INSs, many of which from follow-ups of
observations performed with future radio and X-ray megastruscture facilities

observations, like timing, spectroscopy, and polarimetry, which still represent
a challenge for 8m-class telescopes and are, in many respects, crucial for
studies on the structure and composition of the neutron star interior and of
its magnetosphere. In this contribution, I briefly summarise the current status

those three parameters, the method presented in the current work allows for the
measurement of myelin bound water content, a surrogate marker of tissue
myelination. Myelin water was measured based on its distinct relaxation with
reduced T2*, resulting in a multiexponential decay signal. However, only 10
points could be acquired on the relaxation curve within a maximum echo time of
<40ms as the quantitative protocol has been adapted previously for fast
acquisitions with whole brain coverage. The sparse sampling required an
adaption of the optimisation approach with additional constraints necessary in
order to obtain reliable results. Therefore, the corresponding pool fractions
were determined using linear optimisation instead of the standard nonnegative
least squares (NNLS). The whole approach including the proper choice of
constraints was optimised and validated in simulation studies. Furthermore, the
independent determination of total water content allows for an absolute
quantification of myelin water content, resulting in a more reliable
measurement in oedemateous tissue. Whole brain maps of T1, T2*, total and
myelin water content were acquired in 12 patients suffering from multiple
sclerosis with mild disease grade. With an acquisition time of 10 minutes only,
the presented multidimensional quantitative MRI protocol provides an
interesting option for the clinical assessment and monitoring of multiple
sclerosis, even on a routine basis.

to be invariably found where the lobe plasma is oldest even where the radio
emission has long since faded. The hotspot complexes seem to show structures
resembling the double shock structure exhibited by the largest radio quasar
4C74.26, with the X-ray shock again being offset closer to the nucleus than the
radio synchrotron shock. In the current paper, the offsets between these shocks
are even larger at 35kpc. Unusually for a classical double (FRII) radio source,
there is smooth low surface-brightness radio emission associated with the
regions beyond the hotspots (further away from the nucleus than the hotspots
themselves), which seems to be symmetric for the ends of both jets. We consider
possible explanations for this phenomenon, and conclude that it arises from
high-energy electrons, recently accelerated in the nearby radio hotspots that
are leaking into a pre-existing weakly-magnetized plasma that are symmetric
relic lobes fed from a previous episode of jet activity. This contrasts with
other manifestations of previous epochs of jet ejection in various examples of
classical double radio sources namely (1) double-double radio galaxies by e.g.
Schoenmakers et al, (2) the double-double X-ray/radio galaxies by Laskar et al

unifying electroweak and strong forces. Despite their indubitable virtues,
among these the gauge coupling unification and the quantization of the electric
charge, one of their shortcomings is the large number of parameters used to
describe the high energy thresholds (HET), which are hard to handle. We present
a new method according to which the effects of the HET, in any GUT model, can
be described by fewer parameters that are randomly produced from the original
set of the parameters of the model. In this way, regions favoured by the
experimental data are easier to locate, avoiding a detailed and time consuming
exploration of the parameter space, which is multidimensional even in the most
economic unifying schemes. To check the efficiency of this method, we directly
apply it to a SUSY SO(10) GUT model in which the doublet-triplet splitting is
realized through the Dimopoulos-Wilczek mechanism. We show that the demand of
gauge coupling unification, in conjunction with precision data, locates regions
of the parameter space in which values of the strong coupling \astrong are
within the experimental limits, along with a suppressed nucleon decay, mediated
by a higgsino driven dimension five operators, yielding lifetimes that are
comfortably above the current experimental bounds. These regions open up for
values of the SUSY breaking parameters m_0, M_1/2 < 1 TeV being therefore
accessible to LHC.

evaluate the details of the scattering process. A comparison is made between
the usually assumed single scattering scenario and one in which multiple
scatterings are energetically important. In the latter case, most of the
radiation is emitted in the Klein-Nishina limit. It is argued that several of
the observed correlations defining the blazar sequence are most easily
understood in a multiple scattering scenario. Observations indicate also that,
in such a scenario, the blazar sequence is primarily governed by the energy
density of relativistic electrons rather than that of the seed photons. The
pronounced X-ray minimum in the spectral energy distribution often observed in
the most luminous blazars is discussed. It is shown how this feature can be
accounted for in a multiple scattering scenario by an extension of standard

We propose a specific ansatz for the structure of Yukawa matrices in SO(10)
unified theory which leads to such relation if neutrinos get masses through
type-II seesaw mechanism. Viability of this ansatz is discussed through
detailed analysis of fermion masses and mixing angles all of which can be
explained in a model which uses three Higgs fields transforming as 10 and one
transforming as $\bar{126}$ representations under SO(10). It is shown that the
proposed ansatz can be derived from an extended model based on the two pairs of
16-dimensional vector-like fermions and an $S_4$ flavor symmetry. The model
leads to the lepton mixing matrix that is dominantly bimaximal with ${\cal

evolutionary stage. The SED of Par-Lup3-4 resembles that of objects with
edge-on disks seen in scattered light, that is, a double peaked-SED and a dip
at ~10 microns. We can fit the whole SED with a single disk model with an
inclination of 81+/-6 degrees which provides a natural explanation for the
under-luminosity of the target. Our analysis allows to put constraints on the
disk inner radius, Rin < 0.05 AU, which is very close to the dust sublimation
radius, and the maximum size of the dust grains, a_max > 10 microns, which
indicates that dust processing has already taken place in Par-Lup3-4.

shown to display reproducible structure that expresses brain architecture and

is that such large-scale structure of coherent activity reflects modularity
properties of brain connectivity graphs. However, to date, there has been no
demonstration that the limited and noisy data available in spontaneous activity
observations could be used to learn full-brain probabilistic models that
generalize to new data. Learning such models entails two main challenges: i)
modeling full brain connectivity is a difficult estimation problem that faces
the curse of dimensionality and ii) variability between subjects, coupled with
the variability of functional signals between experimental runs, makes the use
of multiple datasets challenging. We describe subject-level brain functional
connectivity structure as a multivariate Gaussian process and introduce a new
strategy to estimate it from group data, by imposing a common structure on the
graphical model in the population. We show that individual models learned from
functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data using this population prior
generalize better to unseen data than models based on alternative
regularization schemes. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a
cross-validated model of spontaneous brain activity. Finally, we use the
estimated graphical model to explore the large-scale characteristics of
functional architecture and show for the first time that known cognitive

  http://2010.neurocomp.fr/; Bruno Cessac
  http://www-sop.inria.fr/neuromathcomp/",,,,"nlin.AO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We briefly review and highlight the consequences of rigorous and exact
results obtained in \cite{cessac:10}, characterizing the statistics of spike
trains in a network of leaky Integrate-and-Fire neurons, where time is discrete
and where neurons are subject to noise, without restriction on the synaptic
weights connectivity. The main result is that spike trains statistics are
characterized by a Gibbs distribution, whose potential is explicitly
computable. This establishes, on one hand, a rigorous ground for the current
investigations attempting to characterize real spike trains data with Gibbs
distributions, such as the Ising-like distribution, using the maximal entropy
principle. However, it transpires from the present analysis that the Ising
model might be a rather weak approximation. Indeed, the Gibbs potential (the
formal ""Hamiltonian"") is the log of the so-called ""conditional intensity"" (the
probability that a neuron fires given the past of the whole network). But, in
the present example, this probability has an infinite memory, and the
corresponding process is non-Markovian (resp. the Gibbs potential has infinite
range). Moreover, causality implies that the conditional intensity does not
depend on the state of the neurons at the \textit{same time}, ruling out the
Ising model as a candidate for an exact characterization of spike trains
statistics. However, Markovian approximations can be proposed whose degree of
approximation can be rigorously controlled. In this setting, Ising model
appears as the ""next step"" after the Bernoulli model (independent neurons)
since it introduces spatial pairwise correlations, but not time correlations.
The range of validity of this approximation is discussed together with possible
approaches allowing to introduce time correlations, with algorithmic
extensions.

about 450 km/s, consistent with the three absorption components found in a
previous far UV study. The ionizing continuum of Mrk 290 fluctuated by a factor
of 1.4 during Chandra observations on a time scale of 17 days. Thus, we put a
lower limit on the distance from the ionizing source of 0.9 pc for the medium
ionized absorber and an upper limit on distance of 2.5 pc for the lowest
ionized absorber. The three ionization components lie on the stable branch of
the thermal equilibrium curve, indicating that the torus is most likely the
origin of warm absorbing gas in Mrk 290. During the XMM-Newton observation, the
ionizing luminosity was 50% lower compared to the one in the Chandra
observation. Neither the ionization parameter nor the column density of the two
absorbing components varied significantly, compared to the results from Chandra
observations. However, the outflow velocities of both components were 1260

through our line of sight. Assuming the torus wind model, the estimated mass
outflow rate is about 1 Solar mass per year.

interactions where, respectively, the BCS-BEC crossover takes place and a
ferromagnetic phase transition is claimed. Crossovers are also described for
optical lattices and multicomponent systems. The crossovers, universal
parameters and phase transitions are described within the Leggett and NSR
models and calculated in detail within the Jastrow-Slater approximation. The
physics of ultracold Fermi atoms is applied to neutron, nuclear and quark
matter, nuclei and electrons in solids whenever possible. Specifically, the
differences between optical lattices and cuprates is discussed w.r.t.
antiferromagnetic, d-wave superfluid phases and phase separation.

through the perspective of their ground-state wave functions. In contrast, we
demonstrate that the \emph{excitations} of fractional quantum Hall (FQH)
systems also contain information to identify the system's topological order.
Entanglement spectrum of the FQH quasihole (QH) excitations is shown to
differentiate between the conformal field theory (CFT) sectors, based on the
relative position of the QH with respect to the entanglement cut. For
Read-Rezayi model states, as well as Coulomb interaction eigenstates, the
counting of the QH entanglement levels in the thermodynamic limit matches
exactly the CFT counting, and sector changes occur as non-Abelian quasiholes
successively cross the entanglement cut.

match the architectural constraints of many quantum computing technologies. The
chosen architecture allows the layout of logical qubits in two dimensions and
the concurrent execution of one- and two-qubit gates with nearest-neighbor
interaction only. The proposed adder works in three phases. In the first phase,
the first column generates the summation output and the other columns do the
carry-lookahead operations. In the second phase, these intermediate values are
propagated from column to column, preparing for computation of the final carry
for each register position. In the last phase, each column, except the first
one, generates the summation output using this column-level carry. The depth
and the number of qubits of the proposed adder are $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$ and O(n),
respectively. The proposed adder executes faster than the adders designed for
the 1D NTC architecture when the length of the input registers $n$ is larger
than 58.

alternative to the lepton flavor symmetry. By giving four explicit sets of the
