theory is a candidate Walking Technicolor theory. Since we are attempting to
distinguish whether this theory is walking or conformal, we also study the
3-flavour theory, which is believed to be conformal, for comparison. We
simulate lattice QCD with 2 and 3 flavours of colour-sextet staggered quarks at
finite temperatures to determine the scales of confinement and chiral-symmetry
breaking from the positions of the deconfinement and chiral-symmetry
restoration transitions. Unlike the case with fundamental quarks, these
transitions are far apart. For 2 flavours the values of beta=6/g^2 for both
transitions increase as Ta is decreased from 1/4 to 1/6 to 1/8, as expected for
a theory whose coupling runs to smaller values as the lattice spacing is
decreased. However, for the chiral transition, the increase in beta between
Ta=1/4 and Ta=1/6 is much larger than the increase between Ta=1/6 and Ta=1/8.
This suggests that between Ta=1/4 and Ta=1/6 we are at strong coupling where
the theory is effectively quenched, while between Ta=1/6 and Ta=1/8 we are
emerging into the weak coupling regime. It will require even smaller Ta values
to determine whether the running of the chiral-transition coupling is
controlled by asymptotic freedom and the theory walks, or if it reaches a
non-zero limit when the transition becomes a bulk transition and the theory is
conformal. The 3 flavour case at Ta=1/4 and Ta=1/6 behaves similarly to the 2
flavour case. Since this theory is expected to be conformal, the interpretation
that we are seeing strong-coupling behaviour, inaccessible from the
weak-coupling limit (continuum) is the most likely interpretation.

liquid atomization in a full cone pressure swirl nozzle is presented. The first
part is devoted to the study of the inner flow. CAD and CFD software are used
in order to determine the most important parameters of the flow at the exit of
nozzle. An important conclusion is the existence of two flow regions: one in
relatively slow motion (the boundary layer) and a second nearly in solid
rotation at a very high angular rate (about 100 000 rad/s) with a thickness of
about 4/5th of the nozzle section. Then, a theoretical and experimental
analysis of the flow outside the nozzle is carried out. In the theoretical
section, the size of the biggest drops is successfully compared to results
stemming from linear instability theory. However, it is also shown that this
theory cannot explain the occurrence of small drops observed in the stability
domain whose size are close to the Kolmogorov and Taylor turbulent length
scale. A Phase Doppler Particle Analyser (PDPA) is used to characterize the
droplet size and velocity distribution. Due to centrifugal force, the smaller
droplets tend to prevail on the spray axis and a peak close to the Taylor
length scale appears progressively in the PDF when increasing the distance from
the nozzle. It is then assumed that these small droplets are the results of a
turbulent cascading atomization process and that in the near nozzle area, since
centrifugal segregation is small, PDF can therefore be fitted with a log-stable
law (Rimbert and S\'ero-Guillaume, 2004). The value of the stability index is
found to be 1.35 very close to a previous experimental result of 1.39 (Rimbert
and Delconte, 2007) but far from a known theoretical value of 1.70 (Rimbert,
2010). This let think about a slightly different underlying process due to the

the phenomena of jamming for assemblies of frictionless Platonic solids.
Systems of these regular convex polyhedra exhibit mechanically stable phases
with density substantially less than optimal for a given shape, revealing that
thermal motion is necessary to access high density phases. We confirm that the
large system jamming threshold of $0.623 \pm 0.003$ for tetrahedra is
consistent with experiments on tetrahedral dice. Also, the extremely
short-ranged translational correlations of packed tetrahedra observed in
experiments are confirmed here, in contrast with those of thermally simulated
glasses. Though highly ordered phases are observed to form for small numbers of
cubes and dodecahedra, the short correlation length scale suppresses ordering
in large systems, resulting in packings that are mechanically consistent with
`orientationally disordered' contacts (point-face and edge-edge contacts). Mild
nematic ordering is observed for large systems of cubes, whereas angular
correlations for the remaining shapes are ultra short-ranged. Power-law scaling
exponents for energy with respect to distance from the jamming threshold
exhibit a clear dependence on the `highest order' percolating contact topology.
These nominal exponents are 6, 4, and 2 for configurations having percolating
point-face (or edge-edge), edge-face, and face-face contacts, respectively.
These Platonic solids exhibit hypostatic behavior, with average jamming contact
number between the isostatic value for spheres and that of asymmetric
particles. These shapes violate the isostatic conjecture, displaying contact
number that decreases monotonically with sphericity. The common symmetry of
dual polyhedra results in local translational structural similarity. (Note

helicity $\pm 2$ there are four models $S_{SD\pm}^{(r)}$ describing parity
singlets of helicities $\pm 2$. They are of first-, second-,third- and
fourth-order ($r=1,2,3,4$) respectively. Here we show that the generalized

Bergshoeff, Hohm and Townsend (BHT) similarly to the soldering of

the three dual models: linearized BHT theory, $S_{SD+}^{(3)} + S_{SD-}^{(3)}$

functions we deduce dual maps between those models. In particular, we learn how

obtained at 3.6 microns with the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) onboard the
Spitzer Space Telescope. Previous measurements at 3.6 microns suffered from
strong systematics and conclusions could hardly be obtained with confidence on
the water detection by comparison of the 3.6 and 5.8 microns observations. We
use a high S/N Spitzer photometric transit light curve to improve the precision
of the near infrared radius of the planet at 3.6 microns. The observation has
been performed using high-cadence time series integrated in the subarray mode.
We are able to derive accurate system parameters, including planet-to-star
radius ratio, impact parameter, scale of the system, and central time of the
transit from the fits of the transit light curve. We compare the results with
transmission spectroscopic models and with results from previous observations
at the same wavelength. We obtained the following system parameters:
R_p/R_\star=0.15566+0.00011-0.00024, b=0.661+0.0053-0.0050, and
a/R_\star=8.925+0.0490-0.0523 at 3.6 microns. These measurements are three
times more accurate than previous studies at this wavelength because they
benefit from greater observational efficiency and less statistic and systematic
errors. Nonetheless, we find that the radius ratio has to be corrected for
stellar activity and present a method to do so using ground-based long-duration
photometric follow-up in the V-band. The resulting planet-to-star radius ratio
corrected for the stellar variability is in agreement with the previous
measurement obtained in the same bandpass (Desert et al. 2009). We also discuss
that water vapour could not be evidenced by comparison of the planetary radius
measured at 3.6 and 5.8 microns, because the radius measured at 3.6 microns is
affected by absorption by other species, possibly Rayleigh scattering by haze.

of the particle on a bound orbit decreases under the action of fast

elements are discussed. The paper compares influences of the Poynting-Robertson
effect, the radial solar wind and the interstellar gas flow on dynamics of the
dust particle in outer planetary region of the Solar System and beyond it, up
to 100 AU.
  Evolution of putative dust ring in the zone of the Edgeworth-Kuiper belt is
studied. Also non-radial solar wind and gravitational effect of major planets
may play an important role. Low inclination orbits of micron-sized dust
particles in the belt are not stable due to fast increase of eccentricity
caused by the interstellar gas flow and subsequent planetary perturbations -
the increase of eccentricity leads to planet crossing orbits of the particles.
  Gravitational and non-gravitational effects are treated in a way which fully
respects physics. As a consequence, some of the published results turned out to
be incorrect. Moreover, the paper treats the problem in a more general way than
it has been presented up to now.
  The influence of the fast interstellar neutral gas flow might not be ignored

spin-orbit coupling, the band structure undergoes a significant change in Fermi
surface topology as the external magnetic field is applied, invalidating the
rigid band picture in which the Zeeman energy only causes chemical potential
shifts. In addition, since Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ is a $t_{2g}$ active system with
unquenched orbital moments, the orbital Zeeman energy is not negligible and
plays an important role in the phase diagram on the magnetic field orientation.
We find that both the total density of states at the Fermi energy and the
entropy exhibit a sudden increase near the critical magnetic field for the
nematic phase, echoing the experimental findings. Our results suggest that
extra cares are necessary to isolate the contributions due to the quantum

fermions, the question arises because a repulsive interaction in the Cooper
channel is a marginally irrelevant operator at the Fermi liquid fixed point and
thus is also expected to infect various physical quantities with logarithms.
Somewhat surprisingly, at least from the renormalization group viewpoint, the
result for the superconducting susceptibility is that two logarithms are not
better than one. In the course of this investigation we derive a
Callan-Symanzik equation for the repulsive Fermi liquid using the

surface reconstruction in two dimensions as a model for the underdoped
cuprates. At energies larger than the boson energy $\omega_b$, the dynamic
nature of the fluctuations is not important and the quasi-particle dispersion
exhibits the shadow feature like that induced by a static long range order. At
lower energies, however, the shadow feature is pushed away by the finite
$\omega_b$. The detailed low energy features are determined by the bare
dispersion and the coupling of quasi-particles to the dynamic fluctuations. We
present how these factors reconstruct the Fermi surface to produce the Fermi
arcs or the Fermi pockets, or their coexistence. Our principal result is that
the dynamic nature of the fluctuations, without invoking a
yet-to-be-established translational symmetry breaking hidden order, can produce
the Fermi pocket centered away from the $(\pi/2,\pi/2)$ towards the zone center
which may coexist with the Fermi arcs. This is discussed in comparison with the
experimental observations.

study the reionization and thermal history of the universe in overdense

galaxy luminosity function for biased regions is markedly different from those
corresponding to average ones. In particular, the effect of radiative feedback
arising from cosmic reionization is visible at much brighter luminosities.
(iii) Because of the enhanced radiative feedback within overdense locations,
the luminosity function in such regions is more sensitive to reionization
history than in average regions. The effect of feedback is visible for absolute
AB magnitude $M_{AB} \gtrsim -17$ at $z=8$, almost within the reach of present

an additional probe of radiative feedback and hence reionization at high

presence of multiple emission components. An upper limit of 10^-6 is placed on
the methanol abundance in the hot core, using a population diagram, large-scale
source model and other considerations. This value is consistent with abundances
previously seen in low-mass hot cores. Furthermore, the highest energy lines at
the highest frequencies display asymmetric profiles, which may arise from

LDA+U method), we perform the structural optimization of BiMnO3 by starting
from different experimentally reported structures. We confirm that
irrespectively on the starting condition, all calculations converge to the same
centrosymmetric structure, in agreement with the previous finding.
Nevertheless, the structural optimization substantially reduces the Jahn-Teller
(JT) distortion in the system. We attribute this fact to the strong competition
of local distortions around the Mn- and Bi-sites: while the local
Mn-environment experiences the JT instability, the one of the Bi-sites favours
the off-centrosymmetric displacements, which involves the same oxygen atoms.
The existence of the second mechanism explains the difference between BiMnO3
and more canonical JT manganites, such as LaMnO3. Finally, being motivated by
experimental studies, we have investigated the formation of different types of
defects and obtained that BiMnO3 (contrary to other considered systems, such as
LaMnO3 and BiFeO3) can relatively easily form oxygen impurities at interstitial
sites. The impurity oxygen atom tends to form a pair with the host oxygen,
which explains the insulating character of the oxygen-excessive BiMnO3+x.
Moreover, we found that the BiMnO3+x samples experience the ""memory effect"",

configuration. We suggest that such a memory effect may explain stability of
some of the crystal structures of BiMnO3, which have been previously reported
experimentally.

for performing non-invasive quantitative assessments of brain tumour glucose
metabolism. Brain tumours are considered fast-growth tumours because of their
high rate of proliferation. In addition, tumour cells exhibit profound genetic,
biochemical and histological differences with respect to the original
non-transformed cell types. Therefore, there is strong interest from the
clinical investigator's point of view in understanding the role of brain
metabolites under normal and pathological conditions and especially in the
development of early tumour detection techniques. Unfortunately, current
diagnosis techniques ignore the dynamic aspects of these signals. It is largely
believed that temporal variations of NMR Spectra are simply due to noise or do
not carry enough information to be exploited by any reliable diagnosis
procedure. Thus, current diagnosis procedures are mainly based on empirical
observations extracted from single averaged spectra. In this paper, firstly a
machine learning framework for the analysis of NMR spectroscopy signals which
can exploit both static and dynamic aspects of these signals is introduced.
Secondly, the dynamics of the signals are further analyzed using elements from
chaos theory in order to understand their underlying structure. Furthermore, we
show that they exhibit rich chaotic dynamics suggesting the encoding of
metabolic pathway information.

quantum mechanics including all changes that result from previous work of the
authors. This shows that the new theory is self-consistent and (in certain
sense) complete. The most important changes are: 1) A new realist
interpretation of quantum mechanics based on the observation that there are
enough objective properties of quantum systems if one looks for them elsewhere
than among values of observables. This enables us to introduce the notion of
quantum object. 2) Classical systems are defined as macroscopic quantum objects
in states close to maximum entropy. For classical mechanics, new states of such
kind are introduced, the so-called maximum-entropy packets, and shown to
approximate classical dynamics better than Gaussian wave packets. 3) A new
solution of quantum measurement problem is proposed for measurements that are
performed on microsystems. First, it is assumed that readings of registration
apparatuses are always signals from detectors. This implies restrictions on
what is observable. Second, an application of the cluster separability
principle leads to the key notion of the paper: the separation status of
microsystems. The processes of preparation and registration include changes of
separation status. A crucial observation is that standard quantum mechanics
does not prescribe the evolution during such changes. This gap can be filled by
new rules without contradicting the rest of quantum mechanics. As an example of
such a new rule, Beltrametti-Cassinelli-Lahti model of measurement is modified
and shown then to satisfy both the probability-reproducibility and the
objectification requirements.

components of filapodial and mechanosensory bundles. Consistent with structural
observations of bundles, we find that the optimal geometry for crosslinking is
overtwisted, requiring a coherent structural change of the helical geometry of
the filaments. We study the linker-dependent thermodynamic transition of
bundled actin filaments from their native state to the overtwisted state and
map out the ""twist-state'' phase diagram in terms of the availability as well
as the flexibility of crosslinker proteins. We predict that the transition from
the uncrosslinked to fully-crosslinked state is highly sensitive to linker
flexibility: flexible crosslinking smoothly distorts the twist-state of bundled
filaments, while rigidly crosslinked bundles undergo a phase transition,
rapidly overtwisting filaments over a narrow range of free crosslinker
concentrations. Additionally, we predict a rich spectrum of intermediate
structures, composed of alternating domains of sparsely-bound (untwisted) and
strongly-bound (overtwisted) filaments. This model reveals that subtle
differences in crosslinking agents themselves modify not only the detailed
structure of parallel actin bundles, but also the thermodynamic pathway by
which they form.

be an important regulator of community structure and assembly. Here we apply a
recently introduced metric of species interaction, fractional (relative)
abundance, to tree species of the tropical wet forest of Barro Colorado Island,
Panam\'a, the particular community that inspired the original model of
non-niche or 'neutral' community dynamics9. We show a distribution of
fractional abundances between pairs of most closely related congeneric tree
species differing from that expected of competitive exclusion, but also
inconsistent with expectations of simple similarity, whether such species
interchangeability (a fundamental requirement of neutrality) is inferred at the
community or the pair level. Similar evidence from a strikingly different dry
forest has been linked to the focused, stable competition of a temporal niche
dynamic. Taken together with these earlier findings, the results reported here
establish a potentially widespread and important role for species interaction
in the diversity and maintenance of natural communities that must be considered
when inferring process from pattern.

instances in which $\eta(q,i)$ is linear in $i$. We examine several dynamical
features of circuits with fully nonlinear memristors, accommodating not only
charge-controlled but also flux-controlled ones, with a characteristic of the

relative entropies, and the Chernoff and Hoeffding measures. Here we show that
the quantum f-divergences are monotonic under the dual of Schwarz maps whenever
the defining function is operator convex. This extends and unifies all
previously known monotonicity results. We also analyze the case where the
monotonicity inequality holds with equality, and extend Petz' reversibility
theorem for a large class of f-divergences and other distinguishability
measures. We apply our findings to the problem of quantum error correction, and
show that if a stochastic map preserves the pairwise distinguishability on a
set of states, as measured by a suitable f-divergence, then its action can be
reversed on that set by another stochastic map that can be constructed from the
original one in a canonical way. We also provide an integral representation for
operator convex functions on the positive half-line, which is the main
ingredient in extending previously known results on the monotonicity inequality

convexity of f is sufficient for the monotonicity, and obtain the inverse
Holder inequality for operators as an application. The presentation is

of the bolometric correction, \lb/$L_{\rm 2-10keV}$ (where \lb~ is the
bolometric luminosity and $L_{\rm 2-10keV}$ is the rest-frame 2-10 keV
luminosity), in radio-quiet active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Correlations between
\ga~ and both bolometric correction and Eddington ratio are presented, based on
simultaneous X-ray, UV, and optical observations of reverberation -mapped AGNs.
These correlations can be compared with those for high-redshift AGNs to check
for any evolutionary effect. Assuming no evolutionary effect in AGNs' spectral
properties, together with the independent estimates of $L_{\rm 2-10keV}$, the
bolometric correction, Eddington ratio, and black hole (BH) mass can all be
estimated from these correlations for high-redshift AGNs, with the mean
uncertainty of a factor of 2-3. If there are independent estimates of BH
masses, \ga~ for high-redshift AGNs can be used to determine their true \lb~
and $L_{\rm 2-10keV}$, and in conjunction with the redshift, can be potentially
used to place constraints on cosmology by comparison with the rest-frame 2-10
keV flux. We find that the true $L_{\rm 2-10keV}$ estimated from \ga~ for the
brightest Type I AGNs with $z<1$ in the Lockman Hole is generally in agreement
with the observed $L_{\rm 2-10keV}$.
  However, there are still many uncertainties, such as the accurate
determination of the intrinsic \ga~ for distant AGNs and the large uncertainty
in the luminosities obtained, which call for significant further study before
``AGN cosmology'' can be considered a viable technique.

virtual reality conjecture is presented. If a photon is a pixel on a
