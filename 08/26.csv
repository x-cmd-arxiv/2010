demonstrate the vikings ability to fabricate beautiful arm and neck rings of
twisted silver and gold rods. Characteristic for such rings is the uniform
appearance of the twisted pattern along the length of the arm ring, as well as
from one arm ring to another, also when found at distant geographical
locations. How can the appearance of the twisted wires be so perfectly
repetitive? We demonstrate that the answer is that the vikings utilized a
self-forming motif: The pattern arises from a twisting of the wires to a
maximally rotated configuration. That is why the twist patterns in these arm
and neck rings are beautiful, repetitive, and universal.

within the 95% confidence circle of PSR J2021+4026. With an archival Chandra

places an upper-limit of 0.1~mJy for any pulsed signal at 18~cm. Together with
the emission properties in X-ray and gamma-ray, the radio quietness suggests
PSR J2021+4026 to be another member of Geminga-like pulsars. In the radio sky
survey data, extended emission features have been identified in the gamma-ray

sampled responses at that value and then computing the p-value of the test. An
estimate of the threshold is provided by fitting a stump, i.e., a piecewise
constant function with a single jump discontinuity, to the observed p-values,
since the corresponding p-values behave in markedly different ways on different
sides of the threshold. The estimate is shown to be consistent, as both the
number of covariate values and the number of responses sampled at each value
become large, and its finite sample properties are studied through an extensive
simulation study. Our approach is computationally simple and can also be used
to estimate the baseline value of the regression function. The procedure is
illustrated on two motivating real data applications. Extensions to multiple

SS~433 undergoes a X-ray spectral transition from the low hard state (LHS) to
the intermediate state (IS). We show that the X-ray broad-band energy spectra
during all spectral states are well fit by a sum of so called ``Bulk Motion
Comptonization (BMC) component'' and by two (broad and narrow) Gaussians for
the continuum and line emissions respectively. In addition to these spectral
model components we also find a strong feature that we identify as a
""blackbody-like (BB)"" component which color temperature is in the range of 4-5
keV in 24 IS spectra during the radio outburst decay in SS~433. Our
observational results on the ""high temperature BB"" bump leads us to suggest the
presence of gravitationally redshifted annihilation line emission in this
source. I\ We have also established the photon index saturation at about 2.3 in
index vs mass accretion correlation. This index-mass accretion correlation
allows us to evaluate the low limit of black hole (BH) mass of compact object
in SS~433, M_{bh}> 2 solar masses, using the scaling method using BHC GX 339-4
as a reference source. Our estimate of the BH mass in SS 433 is consistent with
recent BH mass measurement using the radial-velocity measurements of the binary
system by Hillwig & Gies who find that M_{x}=(4.3+/-0.8 solar masses. This is
the smallest BH mass found up to now among all BH sources. Moreover, the index
saturation effect versus mass accretion rate revealed in SS~433, like in a
number of other BH candidates, is the strong observational evidence for the

accumulation of the Coulomb-hole. A wavevector dependent correction factor can
be incorporated as the basis for a new static approximation. This factor can be
approximated by a single scaling function, determined from the homogeneous
electron gas model. The local field effect in real materials is captured by a
simple ansatz based on symmetry consideration. As inherited from the COHSEX
approximation, the new approximation presents a Hermitian self-energy operator
and the summation over empty states is eliminated from the evaluation of the
self energy operator. Tests were conducted comparing the new approximation to
GW calculations for diverse materials ranging from crystals and nanotubes. The
accuracy for the minimum gap is about 10% or better. Like in the COHSEX

selection mechanism for scientific work, papers and projects. Peer review as a
selection mechanism is hard to evaluate in terms of its efficiency. Serious
efforts to understand its strengths and weaknesses have not yet lead to clear
answers. In theory peer review works if the involved parties (editors and
referees) conform to a set of requirements, such as love for high quality
science, objectiveness, and absence of biases, nepotism, friend and clique
networks, selfishness, etc. If these requirements are violated, what is the
effect on the selection of high quality work? We study this question with a
simple agent based model. In particular we are interested in the effects of
rational referees, who might not have any incentive to see high quality work
other than their own published or promoted. We find that a small fraction of
incorrect (selfish or rational) referees can drastically reduce the quality of
the published (accepted) scientific standard. We quantify the fraction for
which peer review will no longer select better than pure chance. Decline of
quality of accepted scientific work is shown as a function of the fraction of
rational and unqualified referees. We show how a simple quality-increasing
policy of e.g. a journal can lead to a loss in overall scientific quality, and
how mutual support-networks of authors and referees deteriorate the system.

  Three distinguished aspects are possessed by Fuchsian equations. First, they
are available via imposing a classical Liouville limit on level-two null-vector
conditions. Second, they fall into some A_1-type integrable systems. Third, the
stress-tensor present there (in terms of the Q-form) manifests itself as a kind

soon made on the one hand, whilst the seemingly mysterious derivation of

of the previous Poincar{\'{e}}'s approach.
  Equipped with these observations, we examined relations between spheric and
toric (classical) conformal blocks via Calogero-Moser/Heun duality. Besides, as
Sutherland model is also obtainable from Calogero-Moser by pinching tori at one
point, we tried to understand its eigenstates from the viewpoint of toric

companion to the nearby (~42 pc) young star TWA 30. Companionship is confirmed
from their statistically consistent proper motions and radial velocities, as
well as a chance alignment probability of only 0.08%. Like TWA 30A, the
spectrum of TWA 30B shows signatures of an actively accreting disk (H I and
alkali line emission) and forbidden emission lines tracing outflowing material
([O I], [O II], [O III], [S II], and [N II]). We have also detected [C I]
emission in the optical data, marking the first such detection of this line in
a pre-main sequence star. Negligible radial velocity shifts in the emission
lines relative to the stellar frame of rest (Delta V < 30 km/s) indicate that
the outflows are viewed in the plane of the sky and that the corresponding
circumstellar disk is viewed edge-on. Indeed, TWA 30B appears to be heavily
obscured by its disk, given that it is 5 magnitudes fainter than TWA 30A at
K-band despite having a slightly earlier spectral type (M4 versus M5). The
near-infrared spectrum of TWA 30B also evinces an excess that varies on day
timescales, with colors that follow classical T Tauri tracks as opposed to
variable reddening (as is the case for TWA 30A). Multi-epoch data show this
excess to be well-modeled by a blackbody component with temperatures ranging
from 630 to 880 K and emitting areas that scale inversely with the temperature.
The variable excess may arise from disk structure such as a rim or a warp at
the inner disk edge located at a radial distance of ~3-5 R_sun. As the second
and third closest actively accreting and outflowing stars to the Sun (after TWA
3), TWA 30AB presents an ideal system for detailed study of star and planetary
formation processes at the low-mass end of the hydrogen-burning spectrum.

for the implementation of cognitive radio (CR). Collaborative spectrum sensing
among the cognitive radio nodes is expected to improve the ability of checking

can only sense a relatively narrow band of radio spectrum. Consequently, the
available channel sensing information is far from being sufficient for
precisely recognizing the wide range of unoccupied channels. Aiming at breaking
this bottleneck, we propose to apply matrix completion and joint sparsity
recovery to reduce sensing and transmitting requirements and improve sensing

and reports them to the fusion center, where occupied channels are then decoded
from the reports by using novel matrix completion and joint sparsity recovery
algorithms. As a result, the number of reports sent from the CRs to the fusion
center is significantly reduced. We propose two decoding approaches, one based
on matrix completion and the other based on joint sparsity recovery, both of
which allow exact recovery from incomplete reports. The numerical results
validate the effectiveness and robustness of our approaches. In particular, in
small-scale networks, the matrix completion approach achieves exact channel
detection with a number of samples no more than 50% of the number of channels
in the network, while joint sparsity recovery achieves similar performance in
large-scale networks.

theory of the D1-brane at finite temperature and at a non-zero density of
R-charge in the framework of gauge/gravity duality. The gravity dual
description involves a charged black hole solution of an
Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton system in 3 dimensions which is obtained by a
consistent truncation of the spinning D1-brane in 10 dimensions. We evaluate
thermal and electrical conductivity as well as the bulk viscosity as a function
of the chemical potential conjugate to the R-charges of the D1-brane. We show
that the ratio of bulk viscosity to entropy density is independent of the
chemical potential and is equal to $1/4\pi$. The thermal conductivity and bulk
viscosity obey a relationship similar to the Wiedemann-Franz law. We show that
at the boundary of thermodynamic stability, the charge diffusion mode becomes
unstable and the transport coefficients exhibit critical behaviour. Our method
for evaluating the transport coefficients relies on expressing the second order
differential equations in terms of a first order equation which dictates the
radial evolution of the transport coefficient. The radial evolution equations
can be solved exactly for the transport coefficients of our interest. We
observe that transport coefficients of the D1-brane theory are related to that
of the M2-brane by an overall proportionality constant which sets the
dimensions.

We present temporal and spectral analyses of archival XMM-Newton data and
photometry of archived near-infrared data in order to investigate the nature of
this source. We find that the X-ray light curve shows a strong modulation at
626 +/- 2 s with a confidence level > 99.9% and a pulsed fraction of 54%.
Spectral fitting demonstrates that the spectrum is consistent with an absorbed
power law. No significant spectral variability was observed over the 626 s
period. We have investigated the possibility that the 626 s period is orbital
in nature (either that of an ultra-compact X-ray binary or an AM CVn) or
related to the spin of a compact object (either an accretion powered pulsar or
an intermediate polar). The X-ray properties of the source and the photometry
of the candidate near-infrared counterparts are consistent with an accreting
neutron star X-ray binary on the near-side of the Galactic bulge, where the 626
s period is most likely indicative of the pulsar spin period. However, we
cannot rule out an ultra-compact X-ray binary or an intermediate polar with the
data at hand. In the former case, if the 626 s modulation is the orbital period
of an X-ray binary, it would be the shortest period system known. In the latter
case, the modulation would be the spin period of a magnetic white dwarf.
However, we find no evidence for absorption dips over the 626 s period, a low
temperature black body spectral component, or Fe Kalpha emission lines. These
features are commonly observed in intermediate polars, making 2XMM
J174016.0-290337 a rather unusual member of this class if confirmed. We instead
suggest that 2XMM J174016.0-290337 could be a new addition to the emerging

provide a great way to test both standard and non-standard theoretical models.
However, they are significantly more complicated than event shapes at e+e-
colliders, involving multiple hard directions, multiple channels and multiple
color structures. In this paper, hadronic event shapes are examined with
Soft-Collinear Effective Theory (SCET) by expanding around the dijet limit. A
simple event shape, threshold thrust, is defined. This observable is global and
has no free parameters, making it ideal for clarifying how resummation of
hadronic event shapes can be done in SCET. Threshold thrust is calculated at
next-to-leading fixed order (NLO) in SCET and resummed to
next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy (NNLL). The scale-dependent parts
of the soft function are shown to agree with what is expected from general
observations, and the factorization formula is explicitly shown to be
renormalization group invariant to 1-loop. Although threshold thrust is not
itself expected to be phenomenologically interesting, it can be modified into a
related observable which allows the jet pT distribution to be calculated and
resummed to NNLL+NLO accuracy. As in other processes, one expects resummation
to be important even for moderate jet momenta due to dynamical threshold
enhancement. A general discussion of threshold enhancement and non-global logs
in hadronic event shapes is also included.

evolution studies. Unfortunately, the models are still poorly calibrated for
certain stellar evolution stages. Of particular concern is the treatment of the
thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) phase, as different
implementations lead to systematic differences in derived galaxy properties.
Post-starburst galaxies are a promising calibration sample, as TP-AGB stars are
thought to be most prominently visible during this phase. Here, we use
post-starburst galaxies in the NEWFIRM medium-band survey to assess different
SPS models. The available photometry allows the selection of a homogeneous and
well-defined sample of 62 post-starburst galaxies at 0.7<z<2.0, from which we
construct a well-sampled composite spectral energy distribution (SED) over the
range 1200-40 000 Angstrom. The SED is well-fit by the Bruzual & Charlot SPS
models, while the Maraston models do not reproduce the rest-frame optical and
near-infrared parts of the SED simultaneously. When the fitting is restricted
to lambda < 6000 Angstrom, the Maraston models overpredict the near-infrared
luminosity, implying that these models give too much weight to TP-AGB stars.
Using the flexible SPS models by Conroy et al, and assuming solar metallicity,
we find that the contribution of TP-AGB stars to the integrated SED is a factor
of ~3 lower than predicted by the latest Padova TP-AGB models. Whether this is
due to lower bolometric luminosities, shorter lifetimes, and/or heavy dust
obscuration of TP-AGB stars remains to be addressed. Altogether, our data
demand a low contribution from TP-AGB stars to the SED of post-starburst
galaxies.

propagation instabilities, rather than variability in the engine luminosity,
are responsible for the X-ray flares with moderate contrast. Strong flares such
as the one detected in GRB 050502B, instead, cannot be reproduced by this model
and require strong variability in the engine activity.

potentially harmful executables. Many of the malicious samples are variations
of previously encountered malware, created by their authors to evade
pattern-based detection. Dealing with these large amounts of data requires
robust, automatic detection approaches. This paper studies malware
classification based on call graph clustering. By representing malware samples
as call graphs, it is possible to abstract certain variations away, and enable
the detection of structural similarities between samples. The ability to
cluster similar samples together will make more generic detection techniques
possible, thereby targeting the commonalities of the samples within a cluster.
To compare call graphs mutually, we compute pairwise graph similarity scores
via graph matchings which approximately minimize the graph edit distance. Next,
to facilitate the discovery of similar malware samples, we employ several
clustering algorithms, including k-medoids and DBSCAN. Clustering experiments
are conducted on a collection of real malware samples, and the results are
evaluated against manual classifications provided by human malware analysts.
Experiments show that it is indeed possible to accurately detect malware
families via call graph clustering. We anticipate that in the future, call
graphs can be used to analyse the emergence of new malware families, and
ultimately to automate implementation of generic detection schemes.

remnant shocks. Recently, it has been shown that the downstream temperature in
some remnants is low compared to the measured shock velocities, implying that
additional pressure support by accelerated particles is present.
  Here we use a two-fluid thermodynamic approach to derive the relation between
post-shock fractional cosmic-ray pressure and post-shock temperature, assuming
no additional heating beyond adiabatic heating in the shock precursor and with
all non-adiabatic heating occurring at the subshock. The derived relations show
that a high fractional cosmic-ray pressure is only possible, if a substantial
fraction of the incoming energy flux escapes from the system. Recently a shock
velocity and a downstream proton temperature were measured for a shock in the
supernova remnant RCW 86. We apply the two-fluid solutions to these
measurements and find that the the downstream fractional cosmic-ray pressure is
at least 50% with a cosmic-ray energy flux escape of at least 20%. In general,
in order to have 5% of the supernova energy go into accelerating cosmic rays,
on average the post-shock cosmic-ray pressure needs to be 30% for an effective

often viewed as either a yet unknown competing order or a precursor state to

cuprates, we demonstrate that local pairing fluctuations, vortex liquid
dynamics and other precursor phenomena can emerge quite generally whenever
fermionic excitations remain gapped across the superconducting transition,
regardless of the gap origin. Our choice of a tractable model is a lattice band
insulator with short-range attractive interactions between fermions in the
s-wave channel. An effective crossover between Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)
and Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) regimes can be identified in any band
insulator above two dimensions, while in two dimensions only the BEC regime
exists. The superconducting transition is ""unconventional"" (non-pair-breaking)
in the BEC regime, identified by either the bosonic mean-field or XY
universality class. The insulator adjacent to the superconductor in the BEC
regime is a bosonic Mott insulator of Cooper pairs, which may be susceptible to
charge density wave ordering. We construct a function of the many-body
excitation spectrum whose non-analytic changes define a sharp distinction
between band and Mott insulators. The corresponding ""second order transition""
can be observed out of equilibrium by driving a Cooper pair laser in the Mott
insulator. We explicitly show that the gap for charged bosonic excitations lies
below the threshold for Cooper pair breakup in any BEC regime, despite quantum
fluctuations. Our discussion ends with a view of possible consequences for
cuprates, where antinodal pair dynamics has certain features in common with our

seen in the SOHO/MDI Doppler data. Our simulated data have a spectrum of
cellular flows with just two components -- a granule component that peaks at
spherical wavenumbers of about 4000 and a supergranule component that peaks at
wavenumbers of about 110. We include the advection of these cellular components
by the axisymmetric flows -- differential rotation and meridional flow -- whose
variations with latitude and depth (wavenumber) are consistent with
observations. We mimic the evolution of the cellular pattern by introducing
random variations to the phases of the spectral components at rates that
reproduce the levels of cross-correlation as functions of time and latitude.
Our simulated data do not include any wave-like characteristics for the
supergranules yet can reproduce the rotation characteristics previously
attributed to wave-like behavior. We find rotation rates which appear faster
than the actual rotation rates and attribute this to the projection effects. We
find that the measured meridional flow does accurately represent the actual

predicts that the magnetosphere tends to untwist in a peculiar way: a bundle of
electric currents (the ""j-bundle"") is formed with a sharp boundary, which
shrinks toward the magnetic dipole axis. Recent observations of shrinking hot
spots on magnetars are consistent with this behavior. (2) Continual discharge
fills the j-bundle with electron-positron plasma, maintaining a nonthermal
corona around the neutron star. The corona outside a few stellar radii strongly
interacts with the stellar radiation and forms a ""radiatively locked"" outflow
with a high e+- multiplicity. The locked plasma annihilates near the apexes of
the closed magnetic field lines. (3) New radiative-transfer simulations suggest
a simple mechanism that shapes the observed X-ray spectrum from 0.1 keV to 1
MeV: part of the thermal X-rays emitted by the neutron star are reflected from
the outer corona and then upscattered by the inner relativistic outflow in the
j-bundle, producing a beam of hard X-rays.

nature of the phenomena producing the transit-like signals. To assist in
exploring the possibility that they are due to an astrophysical false positive,
we describe a procedure (BLENDER) to model the photometry in terms of a ""blend""
rather than a planet orbiting a star. A blend may consist of a background or
foreground eclipsing binary (or star-planet pair) whose eclipses are attenuated
by the light of the candidate and possibly other stars within the photometric
aperture. We apply BLENDER to the case of Kepler-9, a target harboring two
previously confirmed Saturn-size planets (Kepler-9b and Kepler-9c) showing
transit timing variations, and an additional shallower signal with a 1.59-day
period suggesting the presence of a super-Earth-size planet. Using BLENDER
together with constraints from other follow-up observations we are able to rule
out all blends for the two deeper signals, and provide independent validation
of their planetary nature. For the shallower signal we rule out a large
fraction of the false positives that might mimic the transits. The false alarm
rate for remaining blends depends in part (and inversely) on the unknown
frequency of small-size planets. Based on several realistic estimates of this
frequency we conclude with very high confidence that this small signal is due
to a super-Earth-size planet (Kepler-9d) in a multiple system, rather than a
false positive. The radius is determined to be 1.64 (+0.19/-0.14) R(Earth), and
current spectroscopic observations are as yet insufficient to establish its

linear transformations of the domain are among the most well-studied properties
in the context of property testing. In this paper, we study the fundamental
class of linear-invariant properties called matroid freeness properties. These
properties have been conjectured to essentially coincide with all testable
linear-invariant properties, and a recent sequence of works has established
testability for increasingly larger subclasses. One question left open,
however, is whether the infinitely many syntactically different properties
recently shown testable in fact correspond to new, semantically distinct ones.
This is a crucial issue since it has also been shown that there exist
subclasses of these properties for which an infinite set of syntactically
different representations collapse into one of a small, finite set of
properties, all previously known to be testable.
  An important question is therefore to understand the semantics of matroid
freeness properties, and in particular when two syntactically different
properties are truly distinct. We shed light on this problem by developing a
method for determining the relation between two matroid freeness properties P
and Q. Furthermore, we show that there is a natural subclass of matroid
freeness properties such that for any two properties P and Q from this
subclass, a strong dichotomy must hold: either P is contained in Q or the two
properties are ""well separated."" As an application of this method, we exhibit
new, infinite hierarchies of testable matroid freeness properties such that at
each level of the hierarchy, there are functions that are far from all
functions lying in lower levels of the hierarchy. Our key technical tool is an
apparently new notion of maps between linear matroids, called matroid
homomorphisms, that might be of independent interest.

delay-sensitive media data for transmission over time-varying wireless
channels. We first formulate the dynamic scheduling problem as a Markov
decision process (MDP) that explicitly considers the users' heterogeneous
multimedia data characteristics (e.g. delay deadlines, distortion impacts and
dependencies etc.) and time-varying channel conditions, which are not
simultaneously considered in state-of-the-art packet scheduling algorithms.
This formulation allows us to perform foresighted decisions to schedule
multiple data units for transmission at each time in order to optimize the
long-term utilities of the multimedia applications. The heterogeneity of the
media data enables us to express the transmission priorities between the
different data units as a priority graph, which is a directed acyclic graph
(DAG). This priority graph provides us with an elegant structure to decompose
the multi-data unit foresighted decision at each time into multiple single-data
unit foresighted decisions which can be performed sequentially, from the high
priority data units to the low priority data units, thereby significantly
reducing the computation complexity. When the statistical knowledge of the
multimedia data characteristics and channel conditions is unknown a priori, we
develop a low-complexity online learning algorithm to update the value
functions which capture the impact of the current decision on the future
utility. The simulation results show that the proposed solution significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art scheduling solutions.

also in the residual topological sector. While the latter relies on the
Dashen's theorem, the latter is based on the minimization of a potential energy
with respect to the phase of the quark condensate. Contrary to some claims, it
is necessary to include the SU(3)-singlet $\eta_0$ tadpole contribution for
strong CP-odd effects induced by the Baluni-type Lagrangian to ensure that
strong CP violation vanishes in the zero axial anomaly limit.

slow-moving targets in the presence of a clutter-spreading environment. When
considering the STAP system deployed with conformal radar array (CFA), the
training data are range-dependent, which results in poor detection performance
of traditional statistical-based algorithms. Current registration-based
compensation (RBC) is implemented based on a sub-snapshot spectrum using
temporal smoothing. In this case, the estimation accuracy of the configuration
parameters and the clutter power distribution is limited. In this paper, the
technique of sparse representation is introduced into the spectral estimation,
and a new compensation method is proposed, namely RBC with sparse
representation (SR-RBC). This method first converts the clutter spectral
estimation into an ill-posed problem with the constraint of sparsity. Then, the
technique of sparse representation, like iterative reweighted least squares
(IRLS), is utilized to solve this problem. Then, the transform matrix is
designed so that the processed training data behaves nearly stationary with the
test cell. Because the configuration parameters and the clutter spectral
response are obtained with full-snapshot using sparse representation, SR-RBC
provides more accurate clutter spectral estimation, and the transformed
training data are more stationary so that better signal-clutter-ratio (SCR)
improvement is expected.

Birkhoff [14]: give a necessary and sufficient condition on the support of a

we relax their subtle measurability hypotheses separating necessity from

of the measure \gamma outside a countable alternating sequence of graphs and
antigraphs in which no two graphs (or two antigraphs) have domains that
overlap, and where the domain of each graph / antigraph in the sequence

account Fermi motion in single scattering and rescattering of the phi to
account for phi absorption on a second nucleon as well as the rescattering of
the proton. We find that the contribution of the double scattering is much
smaller than the typical cross section of gamma p to phi p in free space, which
implies a very small screening of the phi production in deuteron. The
contribution from the proton rescattering, on the other hand, is found to be
not negligible compared to the cross section of gamma p to phi p in free space,
and leads to a moderate reduction of the phi photoproduction cross section on a
deuteron at forward angles if LEPS set up is taken into account. The Fermi
motion allows contribution of the single scattering in regions forbidden by
phase space in the free case. In particular, we find that for momentum
transferred squared close to the maximum value, the Fermi motion changes
drastically the shape of d sigma / dt, to the point that the ratio of this
cross section to the free one becomes very sensitive to the precise value of t

between the discrete energy levels of an atom and photons in a single-mode

such a system as a source of single photons; a vital ingredient in quantum
information and optical computing schemes. Here, we analyze and ``time-adjust''
the photon-counting statistics of such a single-photon source, and show that
the photon statistics can be described by a simple `transport-like'
non-equilibrium model. We then show that there is a one-to-one correspondence
of this model to that of non-equilibrium transport of electrons through a
double quantum dot nanostructure. Then we prove that the statistics of the
tunnelling electrons is equivalent to the statistics of the emitted photons.
This represents a unification of the fields of photon counting statistics and
electron transport statistics. This correspondence empowers us to adapt several
tools previously used for detecting quantum behavior in electron transport
systems (e.g., super-Poissonian shot noise, and an extension of the
Leggett-Garg inequality) to single-photon-source experiments.

we construct two examples of non-polyhedral Okounkov bodies. In the first one,
the variety we deal with is Fano and the line bundle is ample. In the second

and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) using a H2O/D2O mixture matching the
silica, in order to highlight the structure of the surfactant aggregates. For
C12E5 strong aggregative adsorption onto the silica beads, with a high plateau
value of the adsorption isotherm above the CMC was found. SANS measurements
were made at a series of loadings, from zero surfactant up to maximum surface
coverage. It is found that the spherical core-shell model nicely reproduces the
SANS data up to and including the local maximum at q = 0.42 nm-1 but not in the
Porod region of high q, indicating that the surface area of the adsorbed
surfactant is underestimated by the model of a uniform adsorbed layer. A
satisfactory representation of the entire scattering profiles is obtained with
the model of micelle-decorated silica beads, indicating that C12E5 is adsorbed
as spherical micellar aggregates. This behaviour is attributed to the high
surface curvature of the silica which prevents an effective packing of the
hydrophobic chains of the amphiphile in a bilayer configuration. For the
maltoside surfactant {\ss}-C12G2 very weak adsorption on the silica beads was
found. The SANS profile indicates that this surfactant forms oblate ellipsoidal
micelles in the silica dispersion, as in the absence of the silica beads.

scalar field as $m_\phi=3.2\times 10^{-31}h$ ${\rm eV}$ such that the scalar
field model can account for the redshift spacings, and we constrain the other
basic parameters by comparing the model with accurate observational data. We
obtain the following constraints: $\Omega_{m,0}=0.28\pm 0.03$ (95% C.L.),
$\Omega_{\phi,0} < 0.035$ (95% C.L.), $\xi > -158$ (95% C.L.) (in the range
$\xi \le 0$). The best fit values of the energy density parameter of the scalar
field and the coupling constant are $\Omega_{\phi,0}= 0.01$ and $\xi= -25$,

Hence, in the scalar field model, the amplitude of the galaxy number count
cannot be large. However, because the best fit values of $\Omega_{\phi,0}$ and
$\xi$ are not $0$, the scalar field model has the possibility of accounting for
the periodic structure in the $N$--$z$ relation of galaxies. The variation of

simultaneously follow radiative transfer of hydrogen-ionizing photons, based on
the optically-thin variable Eddington tensor approximation as implemented in
the {\small GADGET} code. We consider only star-forming galaxies as sources and
examine to what extent they can yield a reasonable reionization history and
thermal state of the intergalactic medium at redshifts around $z\sim 3$. This
serves as an important benchmark for our self-consistent methodology to
simulate galaxy formation and reionization, and for future improvements through
accounting of other sources and other wavelength ranges. We find that star
formation alone is sufficient for reionizing the Universe by redshift $z\sim6$.
For a suitable choice of the escape fraction and the heating efficiency, our
models are approximately able to account at the same time for the one-point
function and the power spectrum of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. The radiation
field has an important impact on the star formation rate density in our
simulations and significantly lowers the gaseous and stellar fractions in
low-mass dark matter halos. Our results thus directly demonstrate the
importance of radiative feedback for galaxy formation. The spatial and temporal
importance of this effect can be studied accurately with the modelling
technique explored here, allowing more faithful simulations of galaxy
formation.

the same probability to transmit on the channel, it has been shown that unfair

Assuming that each node is rational and implements a best response strategy, we
show that efficient equilibria conditions can be reached when stations are
interested in both uploading and downloading traffic. More interesting, these
equilibria are reached when all the stations play the same strategy, thus
guaranteeing a fair resource sharing. When stations are interested in upload
traffic only, we also propose a mechanism design, based on an artificial
dropping of layer-2 acknowledgments, to force desired equilibria. Finally, we
propose and evaluate some simple DCF extensions for practically implementing

becoming important due to the fact that the angular velocity of the locally non

heated by either an intense burst of massive star formation, an active galactic
nucleus (AGN), or a combination of both. Disentangling the contribution of each
of those putative dust-heating agents is a challenging task, and direct imaging
of the innermost few pc can only be accomplished at radio wavelengths, using
very high-angular resolution observations. Aims: We observed the nucleus A of
the interacting starburst galaxy Arp 299, using very long baseline
interferometry (VLBI) radio observations at 1.7 and 5.0 GHz. Our aim was to
characterize the compact sources in the innermost few pc region of Arp 299-A,
as well as to detect recently exploded core-collapse supernovae. Methods: We
used the European VLBI Network (EVN) to image the 1.7 and 5.0 GHz compact radio
emission of the parsec-scale structure in the nucleus of Arp 299-A with
milliarcsecond resolution. Results: Our EVN observations show that one of the
compact VLBI sources, A1, previously detected at 5.0 GHz, has a flat spectrum
between 1.7 and 5.0 GHz and is the brightest source at both frequencies. Our
1.7 GHz EVN image shows also diffuse, low-surface brightness emission extending
westwards from A1 and displays a prominent core-jet structure. Conclusions: The
morphology, radio luminosity, spectral index and ratio of radio-to-X-ray
emission of the A1-A5 region is consistent with a low-luminosity AGN (LLAGN),
and rules out the possibility that it is a chain of young radio supernovae
(RSNe) and supernova remnants (SNRs). We therefore conclude that A1-A5 is the
long-sought AGN in Arp 299-A. This finding may suggest that both starburst and
AGN are frequently associated phenomena in mergers.

incidence of MgII absorbers towards a third class of objects: the Blazars. This
class includes the BL Lac object population for which a tentative excess of
MgII systems had already been reported. We observed with FORS1 at the ESO-VLT
42 Blazars with an emission redshift 0.8<z_em<1.9, to which we added the three
high z northern objects belonging to the 1Jy BL Lac sample. We detect 32 MgII
absorbers in the redshift range 0.35-1.45, leading to an excess in the
incidence of MgII absorbers compared to that measured towards QSOs by a factor
~2, detected at 3 sigma. The amplitude of the effect is similar to that found
along GRB sightlines. Our analysis provides a new piece of evidence that the
observed incidence of MgII absorbers might depend on the type of background
source. In front of Blazars, the excess is apparent for both 'strong' (w_
r(2796) > 1.0 A) and weaker (0.3 < w_r(2796) < 1.0 A) MgII systems. The
dependence on velocity separation with respect to the background Blazars
indicates, at the ~1.5 sigma level, a potential excess for beta = v/c ~0.1. We
show that biases involving dust extinction or gravitational amplification are
not likely to notably affect the incidence of MgII systems towards Blazars.
Finally we discuss the physical conditions required for these absorbers to be
gas entrained by the powerful Blazar jets. More realistic numerical modelling
of jet-ambient gas interaction is required to reach any firm conclusions as
well as repeat observations at high spectral resolution of strong MgII
absorbers towards Blazars in both high and low states.

more carefully. These claims have their root in a brief debate in the late
1990s about the standard calculation of the scalar and tensor spectra in
standard inflationary theory, where Grishchuk and collaborators claimed that
their amplitudes should be roughly equal. We give a brief summary of the debate
and our own reasons for why the standard calculation is correct.

and the phase of the complex visibility, may be corrupted by parasitic fringes
superimposed on the genuine fringe pattern. These fringes are due to an
interference phenomenon occurring from straylight effects inside an
interferometric instrument. We developed an analytical approach to better
understand this phenomenon when straylight causes crosstalk between beams.
  We deduced that the parasitic interference significantly affects the
interferometric phase and thus the associated observables including the
differential phase and the closure phase. The amount of parasitic flux coupled
to the piston between beams appears to be very influential in this degradation.
For instance, considering a point-like source and a piston ranging from
$\lambda/500$ to $\lambda/5$ in L band ($\lambda=3.5\:\mu$m), a parasitic flux
of about 1\% of the total flux produces a parasitic phase reaching at most one
third of the intrinsic phase. The piston, which can have different origins
(instrumental stability, atmospheric perturbations, ...), thus amplifies the
effect of parasitic interference.
  According to specifications of piston correction in space or at ground level
(respectively $\lambda/500\approx 2$nm and $\lambda/30\approx 100$nm), the
detection of hot Jupiter-like planets, one of the most challenging aims for
current ground-based interferometers, limits parasitic radiation to about 5\%
of the incident intensity. This was evaluated by considering different types of
hot Jupiter synthetic spectra.
  Otherwise, if no fringe tracking is used, the detection of a typical hot
Jupiter-like system with a solar-like star would admit a maximum level of
parasitic intensity of 0.01\% for piston errors equal to $\lambda$/15. If the
fringe tracking specifications are not precisely observed, it thus appears that
the allowed level of parasitic intensity dramatically decreases and may prevent
the detection. In parallel, the calibration of the parasitic phase by a
reference star, at this accuracy level, seems very difficult. Moreover, since
parasitic phase is an object-dependent quantity, the use of a hypothetical
phase abacus, directly giving the parasitic phase from a given parasitic flux
level, is also impossible. Some instrumental solutions, implemented at the
instrument design stage for limiting or preventing this parasitic interference,
appears to be crucial and are presented in this paper.

current which arises in a quantum point contact (QPC) with spin-orbit
interaction (SOI) upon a small voltage is applied. In the model, the QPC is
considered as a saddle point of two-dimensional potential landscape. The SOI
acts within a finite region and is absent deep in the reservoirs. The SOI
strength is not supposed to be strong. It is shown that the spin polarization
appears in the third order of the perturbation theory as a result of definite
combinations of electron transitions. They include two intersubband transitions
to nearest subbands and one intrasubband transition. The spin current is
proportional to the cube of the SOI strength and strongly depends on geometric
parameters of the saddle point. The spin is polarized in the plane of the QPC
and directed normally to the electron current if the SOI is of Rashba type. As
a function of the saddle-point potential (i.e., the height of the QPC barrier),
the spin conductance and especially the spin polarization have characteristic
features (specifically, peaks) correlated with the charge conductance
quantization steps. The peak shape depends on the length of the region where
the SOI acts. In QPCs with sharp potential landscape, this picture is distorted
by interference processes.

non-equilibrium theory of Markov chains, we introduce the net flux into
discussion and acquire an expression of product rate in NESS, which has clear
biophysical significance. Up till now, it is a general belief that being an
activator or an inhibitor is an intrinsic property of the modifier. However, we
reveal that this traditional point of view is based on the equilibrium
assumption. A modifier may no longer be an overall activator or inhibitor when
the reaction system is not in equilibrium. Based on the regulation of enzyme
activity by the modifier concentration, we classify the kinetic behavior of the
modifier into three categories, which are named hyperbolic behavior,
bell-shaped behavior, and switching behavior, respectively. We show that the
switching phenomenon, in which a modifier may convert between an activator and
an inhibitor when the modifier concentration varies, occurs only in NESS.
Effects of drugs on the Pgp ATPase activity, where drugs may convert from
activators to inhibitors with the increase of the drug concentration, are taken
as a typical example to demonstrate the occurrence of the switching phenomenon.

we could confirm common proper motion (>39 sigma) and detected orbital motion

companion is consistent with a brown dwarf with a mass of 24 to 40 MJup, at the

of critical solutions of spin-carrying atoms in closed carbon nanotubes (CNTs).
The total effective dipolar coupling of nuclear spin-carrying of 129^Xe atoms
is the sum of 2 terms i.e. g_0 of non-correlated 129^Xe atoms and g_1 depending
on density fluctuations of Xe atoms. The coupling g_0 falls off to 0 as 1/V
with increasing the volume V of CNTs, while the g_1 remains finite for long
CNTs containing critical solution of Xe atoms. The g_1 is derived within the
Landau-Ginzburg framework. When temperature T goes to critical temperature T_c,
the g_1 is about 10 Hz for 129^Xe fluid in closed long tubes. To achieve the
g_1>> g_0, 3 conditions should be met: (1) the large mobility of 129^Xe atoms,
(2) the maximal isothermal compressibility of Xe nanofluid within CNTs that
have to be (3) long and closed. We discuss 3 applications of such a behavior.
First, when T goes to T_c, the FID from N magnetically equivalent 129^Xe atoms
is broadened so wide that the FID splits into lattice of N equidistant
resonances with finite spacing G=3g_1. Second, the absorption line shape of
129^Xe atoms in spin state I=N/2, m=N/2 has a single delta peak at frequency
with the large shift N*G/2 from Larmor frequency W for N>>1. The dipolar field
of nanofluid in the spin state I=N/2, m=-N/2 inverts the total magnetic field
if N>1+2W/G. Third, we discuss the spontaneous superradiation of the nanofluid
in course of depolarization I_x(t) in low-field resonator. At CP of the
nanofluid, the I_x(t) causes the bursts of dissipated power ~(g_1)^2*N^3. In
the opposite limiting case of the strong field resonator, the depolarization
I_x(t) has the Dicke's power ~(W*N)^2. Far from the CP of Xe nanofluid, the
dissipated power scales linear with N for fixed density of 129^Xe atoms.

evolution and accretion luminosity at a numerical resolution down to 1.27 AU.
In the 2D approximation of axially symmetric simulations, it is possible for
the first time to simulate the whole accretion phase (up to the end of the
accretion disk epoch) for the forming massive star and to perform a broad scan
of the parameter space. Our simulation series show evidently the necessity to
incorporate the dust sublimation front to preserve the high shielding property
of massive accretion disks. While confirming the upper mass limit of
spherically symmetric accretion, our disk accretion models show a persistent
high anisotropy of the corresponding thermal radiation field. This yields to
the growth of the highest-mass stars ever formed in multi-dimensional radiation
hydrodynamics simulations, far beyond the upper mass limit of spherical
accretion. Non-axially symmetric effects are not necessary to sustain
accretion. The radiation pressure launches a stable bipolar outflow, which
grows in angle with time as presumed from observations. For an initial mass of
the pre-stellar host core of 60, 120, 240, and 480 Msun the masses of the final

flow equations for a Bose gas are derived in a scheme which treats the

correlations among three and more particles. These flow equations are solved
within a truncation which allows to extract the complete frequency and momentum
structure of the normal and anomalous self-energies. Both the asymptotic small
momentum regime, where perturbation regime fails, as well as the perturbative
regime at larger momenta are well described within a single unified approach.
The self-energies do not exhibit any infrared divergences, satisfy the U(1)
symmetry constraints, and are in accordance with the Nepomnyashchy relation
which states that the anomalous self-energy vanishes at zero momentum and zero
frequency. From the self-energies we extract the single-particle spectral
density of the two-dimensional Bose gas. The dispersion is found to be of the
Bogoliubov form and shows the crossover from linear Goldstone modes to the
quadratic behavior of quasi-free bosons. The damping of the quasiparticles is
found to be in accordance with the standard Beliaev damping. We furthermore
recover the exact asymptotic limit of the propagators derived by Gavoret and

the surprising form of X-ray/optical cross-correlation functions, a positive
correlation signal preceded by an anti-correlation signal, is seen in all the

than reprocessing as being the dominant driver of the short-term variability in
the optical emission. This behaviour appears more pronounced when the X-ray

up on the phenomenological approach suggested by Hillas et al. (1998), the
broad band spectral and spatial measurement (from radio to low-energy

While this model per construction provides an excellent description of the data
at energies < 1 GeV, the predicted inverse Compton component matches the
combined Fermi/LAT and IACT measurements remarkably well after including all
relevant seed photon fields and fitting the average magnetic field to B = (124

algorithms that achieve small regret (additional loss on the whole data)
compared to a reference scheme. In the simplest such scheme one compares to the
loss of the best expert in hindsight. A more ambitious goal is to split the
data into segments and compare to the best expert on each segment. This is
appropriate if the nature of the data changes between segments. The standard
fixed-share algorithm is fast and achieves small regret compared to this
scheme.
  Fixed share treats the experts as black boxes: there are no assumptions about
how they generate their predictions. But if the experts are learning, the
following question arises: should the experts learn from all data or only from
data in their own segment? The original algorithm naturally addresses the first
case. Here we consider the second option, which is more appropriate exactly
when the nature of the data changes between segments. In general extending
fixed share to this second case will slow it down by a factor of T on T

Restricted Isometry Property (RIP). Namely, for some c>0, large N and any n
satisfying N^{1-c} < n < N, we construct RIP matrices of order k^{1/2+c}. This
overcomes the natural barrier k=O(n^{1/2}) for proofs based on small coherence,
which are used in all previous explicit constructions of RIP matrices. Key
ingredients in our proof are new estimates for sumsets in product sets and for
exponential sums with the products of sets possessing special additive
structure. We also give a construction of sets of n complex numbers whose k-th
moments are uniformly small for 1\le k\le N (Turan's power sum problem), which
improves upon known explicit constructions when (\log N)^{1+o(1)} \le n\le
(\log N)^{4+o(1)}. This latter construction produces elementary explicit
examples of n by N matrices that satisfy RIP and whose columns constitute a new
spherical code; for those problems the parameters closely match those of
existing constructions in the range (\log N)^{1+o(1)} \le n\le (\log
N)^{5/2+o(1)}.

derivation of a linear time-varying (LTV) system that fully captures the
dynamics of the nonlinear system, allowing for the use of powerful linear
system analysis and filtering design tools that yield GAS filter error
dynamics. Simulation results reveal that the proposed filter is able to achieve
the same level of performance of more traditional solutions, such as the
Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), while providing, at the same time, GAS
guarantees, which are absent for the EKF.

represents the strength of electromagnetic coupling in the limit of
sufficiently low energy interactions, is the crucial fundamental physical
parameter that governs a nearly limitless range of phenomena involving the
interaction of radiation with materials. Ideally, the apparatus of physical
theory should be competent to provide a calculational procedure that yields a
quantitatively correct value for {\alpha} and the physical basis for its
computation. This study presents the first demonstration of an observationally
anchored theoretical procedure that predicts a unique value for {\alpha} that
stands in full agreement with the best (~370 ppt) high-precision experimental
determinations. In a directly connected cryptographic computation, the method
that gives these results also yields the magnitude of the cosmological constant
{\Omega}{\Lambda} in conformance with the observational data and the condition
of perfect flatness ({\Omega}{\Lambda} + {\Omega}m=1.0). Connecting
quantitatively the colossal with the tiny by exact statements, these findings
testify that the universe is a system of such astonishing perfection that an
epistemological limit is unavoidably encountered.

transport calculations based on density functional theory: Parametrized Bethe
lattices and quasi-one dimensional wires or nanowires. A detailed account of
implementation details in both cases is given. From the systematic study of
nanocontacts made of representative metallic elements, we can conclude that
parametrized electrode models represent an excellent compromise between
computational cost and electronic structure definition as long as the aim is to
compare with experiments where the precise atomic structure of the electrodes
is not relevant or defined with precision. The results obtained using
parametrized Bethe lattices are essentially similar to the ones obtained with
quasi one dimensional electrodes for large enough sections of these, adding a
natural smearing to the transmission curves that mimics the true nature of
polycrystalline electrodes. The latter are more demanding from the
computational point of view, but present the advantage of expanding the range
of applicability of transport calculations to situations where the electrodes
have a well-defined atomic structure, as is case for carbon nanotubes, graphene
nanoribbons or semiconducting nanowires. All the analysis is done with the help
of codes developed by the authors which can be found in the quantum transport
toolbox Alacant and are publicly available.

  and temperature effects","10 pages, 17 figures",,"10.1103/PhysRevB.83.134122",,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Mechanical shear deformations lead, in some cases, to effects similar to
those resulting from ion irradiation. Here we characterize the effects of shear
velocity and temperature on amorphous silicon (\aSi) modelled using classical
molecular dynamics simulations based on the empirical Environment Dependent
Inter-atomic Potential (EDIP). With increasing shear velocity at low
temperature, we find a systematic increase in the internal strain leading to
the rapid appearance of structural defects (5-fold coordinated atoms). The
impacts of externally applied strain can be almost fully compensated by
increasing the temperature, allowing the system to respond more rapidly to the
deformation. In particular, we find opposite power-law relations between the
temperature and the shear velocity and the deformation energy. The spatial
distribution of defects is also found to strongly depend on temperature and
strain velocity. For low temperature or high shear velocity, defects are
concentrated in a few atomic layers near the center of the cell while, with
increasing temperature or decreasing shear velocity, they spread slowly
throughout the full simulation cell. This complex behavior can be related to
the structure of the energy landscape and the existence of a continuous
energy-barrier distribution.

based on the idea of photonic portal, we consider a new possible astrophysical
process of weak photoproduction of sterile scalars from the cold dark matter
consisting of sterile Dirac fermions. Subsequently, these scalars weakly decay
into secondary couples of photons. Then, primary photons, if energetic enough
and interacting in sufficiently dense dark-matter configurations, may form
secondary-photon cascades appearing as a new astrophysical phenomenon. Primary
photons, probing the cold dark matter, may come e.g. from gamma bursts. We show
how the cross-section for the photoproduction and the rate for the decay can be
calculated (in the centre-of-mass frame and at rest, respectively, for
simplicity).

manganites, the Co content dependences of the structural, magnetic, and
transport properties were studied. Variation of lattice constant by the
substitution of Co ions is well reproduced considering that divalent and
trivalent Co ions substitute for Mn ions at the perovskite B-sites. For 0 <= y

increase with increasing Co content, retaining the insulating properties.
Detailed analyses of transport and magnetic properties indicate the
contribution of both double exchange and superexchange interactions to the
appearance of the ferromagnetic insulating phase.
