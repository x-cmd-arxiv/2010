ultrathin films with perpendicular anisotropy. The whole parameter space of
relevant coupling constants is studied in first order anisotropy approximation.
Because the ground state is known to be formed by perpendicular stripes
separated by Bloch walls, a standard variational approach is used, complemented
with specially designed Monte Carlo simulations. We can distinguish four
regimes according to the different nature of striped domains: a high anisotropy
Ising regime with sharp domain walls, a saturated stripe regime with thicker
walls inside which an in-plane component of the magnetization develops, a
narrow canted-like regime, characterized by a sinusoidal variation of both the
in-plane and the out of plane magnetization components, which upon further
decrease of the anisotropy leads to an in-plane ferromagnetic state via a spin
reorientation transition (SRT). The nature of domains and walls are described
in some detail together with the variation of domain width with anisotropy, for
any value of exchange and dipolar interactions. Our results, although strictly
valid at $T=0$, can be valuable for interpreting data on the evolution of
domain width at finite temperature, a still largely open problem.

application of control variates to estimation problems involving data from

as control variates, and we introduce a new, consistent estimator for the
values of the coefficients of the optimal linear combination of these
functions. The form and proposed construction of the control variates is
derived from our solution of the Poisson equation associated with a specific
MCMC scenario. The new estimator, which can be applied to the same MCMC sample,
is derived from a novel, finite-dimensional, explicit representation for the
optimal coefficients. The resulting variance-reduction methodology is primarily
applicable when the simulated data are generated by a conjugate random-scan
Gibbs sampler. MCMC examples of Bayesian inference problems demonstrate that
the corresponding reduction in the estimation variance is significant, and that
in some cases it can be quite dramatic. Extensions of this methodology in
several directions are given, including certain families of Metropolis-Hastings
samplers and hybrid Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithms. Corresponding
simulation examples are presented illustrating the utility of the proposed
methods. All methodological and asymptotic arguments are rigorously justified

The unprecedented resolution and sensitivity of the GALFA-HI survey have
resulted in the detection of numerous isolated, very compact HI clouds at low
Galactic velocities, which are distinctly separated from the HI disk emission.
In the limited area of ~4600 deg$^2$ surveyed so far, we have detected 96 of
such compact clouds. The detected clouds are cold with a median T$_{k,max}$
(the kinetic temperature in the case in which there is no non-thermal
broadening) of 300 K. Moreover, these clouds are quite compact and faint, with
median values of 5 arcmin in angular size, 0.75 K in peak brightness
temperature, and $5 \times 10^{18}$ cm$^{-2}$ in HI column density. Most of the
clouds deviate from Galactic rotation at the 20-30 km/s level, and a
significant fraction show evidence for a multiphase medium and velocity
gradients. No counterparts for these clouds were found in other wavebands. From
the modeling of spatial and velocity distributions of the whole compact cloud
population, we find that the bulk of the compact clouds are related to the
Galactic disk, and their distances are likely to be in the range of 0.1 to a
few kpc. We discuss various possible scenarios for the formation and
maintenance of this cloud population and its significance for Galactic ISM
studies.

textures are integral to the function of the system they enclose. They are
designed to yield a predetermined rubbing response. Developing such entities
relies on controlling the structure of the rubbing interface so that, not only
the surface is of optimized topography, but also is able to self-adjust its
behavior according to the evolution of sliding conditions. Inspirations for
such designs are frequently encountered in natural species. In particular, and
from a tribological point of view, Squamate Reptiles, offer diverse examples
where surface texturing, submicron and nano-scale features, achieves frictional
regulation. In this paper, we study the frictional response of shed skin
obtained from a Python regius snake. The study employed a specially designed
tribo-acoustic probe capable of measuring the coefficient of friction and
detecting the acoustical behavior of the skin in vivo. The results confirm the
anisotropy of the frictional response of snakes. It is found that the
coefficient of friction depends on the direction of sliding: the value in
forward motion is lower than that in the backward direction. Diagonal and side
winding motion induces a different value of the friction coefficient. We
discuss the origin of such a phenomenon in relation to surface texturing and
study the energy constraints, implied by anisotropic friction, on the motion of
the reptile and to establish a reference for comprehending the frictional
response we draw a comparison to the friction of human skin.

for a sequence of representations V_n of groups G_n. A central application of
the new viewpoint we introduce here is the importation of representation theory
into the study of homological stability. This makes it possible to extend
classical theorems of homological stability to a much broader variety of
examples. Representation stability also provides a framework in which to find
and to predict patterns, from classical representation theory
(Littlewood--Richardson and Murnaghan rules, stability of Schur functors), to
cohomology of groups (pure braid, Torelli and congruence groups), to Lie
algebras and their homology, to the (equivariant) cohomology of flag and
Schubert varieties, to combinatorics (the (n+1)^(n-1) conjecture). The majority
of this paper is devoted to exposing this phenomenon through examples. In doing
this we obtain applications, theorems and conjectures.
  Beyond the discovery of new phenomena, the viewpoint of representation
stability can be useful in solving problems outside the theory. In addition to
the applications given in this paper, it is applied in [CEF] to counting
problems in number theory and finite group theory. Representation stability is
also used in [C] to give broad generalizations and new proofs of classical
homological stability theorems for configuration spaces on oriented manifolds.

show here that the counting measure on the set of pivotal points of critical
site percolation on the triangular grid, normalized appropriately, has a
scaling limit, which is a function of the scaling limit of the percolation
configuration. We also show that this limit measure is conformally covariant,
with exponent 3/4. Similar results hold for the counting measure on macroscopic
open clusters (the area measure), and for the counting measure on interfaces
(length measure).
  Since the aforementioned processes are very much governed by pivotal sites,
the construction and properties of the ""local time""-like pivotal measure are
key results in this project. Another application is that the existence of the
limit length measure on the interface is a key step towards constructing the
so-called natural time-parametrization of the SLE(6) curve.
  The proofs make extensive use of coupling arguments, based on the separation
of interfaces phenomenon. This is a very useful tool in planar statistical
physics, on which we included a self-contained Appendix. Simple corollaries of
our methods include ratio limit theorems for arm probabilities and the
rotational invariance of the two-point function.

size. We use an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model of West Nile Virus
in birds to show that pathogen replication rates decline with host body size,
but natural immune system (NIS) response rates do not change systematically
with body size. This is surprising since the NIS has to search for small
quantities of pathogens through larger physical spaces in larger organisms, and
also respond by producing larger absolute quantities of antibody in larger
organisms. We call this scale-invariant detection and response. We hypothesize
that the NIS has evolved an architecture to efficiently neutralize pathogens.
We investigate a range of architectures using an Agent Based Model (ABM). We
find that a sub-modular NIS architecture, in which lymph node number and size
both increase sublinearly with body size, efficiently balances the tradeoff
between local pathogen detection and global response using antibodies. This
leads to nearly scale-invariant detection and response, consistent with
experimental data. Similar to the NIS, physical space and resources are also
important constraints on Artificial Immune Systems (AIS), especially
distributed systems applications used to connect low-powered sensors using
short-range wireless communication. We show that AIS problems, like distributed
robot control, will also require a sub-modular architecture to efficiently
balance the tradeoff between local search for a solution and global response or
proliferation of the solution between different components. This research has
wide applicability in other distributed systems AIS applications.

surfactant solutions, in which the various stages of aggregation are treated as
constrained paths on a single free-energy landscape. Three stages of
well-separated time scales are distinguished. The first and longest stage
involves homogeneous nucleation of micelles, for which we derive the size of
the critical nuclei, their concentration, and the nucleation rate.
Subsequently, a much faster growth stage takes place, which is found to be
diffusion-limited for surfactant concentrations slightly above the critical
micellar concentration ({\it cmc}), and either diffusion-limited or kinetically
limited for higher concentrations. The time evolution of the growth is derived
for both cases. At the end of the growth stage the micelle size may be either
larger or smaller than its equilibrium value, depending on concentration. A
final stage of equilibration follows, during which the micelles relax to their
equilibrium size through fission or fusion. Both cases of fixed surfactant
concentration (closed system) and contact with a reservoir of surfactant
monomers (open system) are addressed and found to exhibit very different
kinetics. In particular, we find that micelle formation in an open system

to free-ride cooperators or not to be exploited by defectors. To consider
opportunistic punisher, we make a change to the sequence of one-shot public
good game; instead of putting action choice first before punishment, the
commitment of punishment is declared first before choosing the action of each
participant. In this commitment-first setting, punisher may use information
about her team, and may defect to increase her fitness in the team. Reversing
sequence of public good game can induce different behavior of punisher, which
cannot be considered in standard setting where punisher always chooses
cooperation. Based on stochastic dynamics developed by evolutionary economists
and biologists, we show that opportunistic punisher can make cooperation evolve
where cooperative punisher fails. This alternative route for the evolution of
cooperation relies paradoxically on the players' selfishness to profit from
others' unconditional cooperation and defection.

cyclic algebra structure over a number field, as for perfect space-time codes,
an outer code can be designed via coset coding. More precisely, we take the
quotient of the algebra by a two-sided ideal which leads to a finite alphabet
for the outer code, with a cyclic algebra structure over a finite field or a
finite ring. We show that the determinant criterion induces various metrics on
the outer code, such as the Hamming and Bachoc distances. When n=2,
partitioning the 2x2 Golden code by using an ideal above the prime 2 leads to
consider codes over either M2(F_2) or M2(F_2[i]), both being non-commutative

context of classical General Relativity (with the addition of several
thermodynamic argumentations) led us to an equivalent statement: collapsing
bodies emit their complete amount of mass and energy as radiation before the
formation of any event horizon. In this paper, we submit the metric we rendered
to the test of Einstein Field Equations, and we propose some modifications to
extend our solutions to more general situations, as the initial moments of
collapse and electrically charged collapses, as well as we effectuate some
considerations about rotating collapses.

two representative models of diffuse neutrino flux from active galactic nuclei
(AGN): one by Koers & Tinyakov (KT) and another by Becker & Biermann (BB). Our
observable has been the number of upgoing muon-neutrinos expected in the
86-string IceCube detector, after 5 years of exposure, in the range 10^5 <
E/GeV < 10^8. We have used the latest estimated discovery potential of the
IceCube-86 array at the 5-sigma level to determine the lower boundary of the
regions, while for the upper boundary we have used either the AMANDA upper
bound on the neutrino flux or the more recent preliminary upper bound given by
the half-completed IceCube-40 array (IC40). We have varied the spectral index
of the proposed power-law fluxes, alpha, and two parameters of the BB model:
the ratio between the boost factors of neutrinos and cosmic rays,
Gamma_nu/Gamma_{CR}, and the maximum redshift of the sources that contribute to
the cosmic-ray flux, zCRmax. For the KT model, we have considered two
scenarios: one in which the number density of AGN does not evolve with redshift
and another in which it evolves strongly, following the star formation rate.
Using the IC40 upper bound, we have found that the models are visible in
IceCube-86 only inside very thin strips of parameter space and that both of
them are discarded at the preferred value of alpha = 2.7 obtained from fits to
cosmic-ray data. Lower values of alpha, notably the values 2.0 and 2.3 proposed
in the literature, fare better. In addition, we have analysed the capacity of
IceCube-86 to discriminate between the models within the small regions of
parameter space where both of them give testable predictions. Within these
regions, discrimination at the 5-sigma level or more is guaranteed.

demonstrating that this does not hold for all q.
  We conclude that the n-th Engel word map is surjective for the groups
PSL(2,q) when q>Q(n). By using the computer, we sharpen this result and show
that for any n<5, the corresponding map is surjective for all the groups
PSL(2,q). This provides evidence for a conjecture of Shalev regarding Engel
words in finite simple groups.
  In addition, we show that the n-th Engel word map is almost measure
preserving for the family of groups PSL(2,q), with q odd, answering another
question of Shalev.
  Our techniques are based on the method developed by Bandman, Grunewald and
Kunyavskii for verbal dynamical systems in the group SL(2,q).
