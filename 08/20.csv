Maxwell's equations as the starting point. It is well known that for dispersive
media this approach does not directly yield exact expressions for the energy
and momentum densities. Although Maxwell's equations fully describe
electromagnetic fields, the general approach to conserved quantities in field
theory is not based on the field equations, but rather on the action. Here an
action principle for macroscopic electromagnetism in dispersive, lossless media
is used to derive the exact conserved energy-momentum tensor. The time-averaged
energy density reduces to Brillouin's simple formula when the fields are
monochromatic. The momentum density is not given by the familiar Minkowski
expression $\mathbf{D}\times\mathbf{B}$, even for time-averaged monochromatic
fields. The results are unaffected by the debate over momentum balance in
light-matter interactions.

dust particle is dropped into the plasma sheath to interact with a second

without introducing any external perturbation. The resulting data is analyzed
using a method employing a polynomial fit to the particle displacement(s),
X(t), to reduce uncertainty in calculation. Employing this technique, the
horizontal confinement is shown to be parabolic over a wide range of pressures

measured and shown to be well-described by a screened Coulomb potential and to
decrease with increasing pressure. Finally, the charge on the particle and the

treat the mathematical behavior of the wavefunction also around and beyond the
horizon (r=2M). Classically, within the horizon, the time component of the
metric becomes spacelike and distance from the origin singularity becomes
timelike, suggesting an inevitable propagation of all matter within the horizon
to a total collapse at r=0. However, the quantum description of the wave
function provides a different understanding of the behavior of matter within
the horizon. We find that a test particle can almost never be found at the
origin and is more probable to be found at the horizon. Matter outside the
horizon has a very small wave length and therefore interference effects can be
found only on a very small atomic scale. However, within the horizon, matter
becomes totally ""tachionic"" and is potentially ""spread"" over all space. Small
location uncertainties on the atomic scale become large around the horizon, and
different mass components of the wave function can therefore interfere on a
stellar scale. This interference phenomenon, where the probability of finding
matter decreases as a function of the distance from the horizon, appears as an
effective gravitational repulsion.

cannot be used as objective distance metrics. Therefore one relies on measures
like the p- or log-det distances, or makes explicit, and often simplistic,
assumptions about sequence evolution. Information theory provides an
alternative, in the form of mutual information (MI) which is, in principle, an
objective and model independent similarity measure. MI can be estimated by
concatenating and zipping sequences, yielding thereby the ""normalized
compression distance"". So far this has produced promising results, but with
uncontrolled errors. We describe a simple approach to get robust estimates of
MI from global pairwise alignments. Using standard alignment algorithms, this
gives for animal mitochondrial DNA estimates that are strikingly close to
estimates obtained from the alignment free methods mentioned above. Our main
result uses algorithmic (Kolmogorov) information theory, but we show that
similar results can also be obtained from Shannon theory. Due to the fact that
it is not additive, normalized compression distance is not an optimal metric
for phylogenetics, but we propose a simple modification that overcomes the
issue of additivity. We test several versions of our MI based distance measures
on a large number of randomly chosen quartets and demonstrate that they all
perform better than traditional measures like the Kimura or log-det (resp.
paralinear) distances. Even a simplified version based on single letter Shannon
entropies, which can be easily incorporated in existing software packages, gave
superior results throughout the entire animal kingdom. But we see the main
virtue of our approach in a more general way. For example, it can also help to
judge the relative merits of different alignment algorithms, by estimating the
significance of specific alignments.

\modsurf. It is far more common to study \emph{sets} of such trajectories,
seeking some asymptotic behavior using an averaging process (see section
\ref{previous}). Our work is only marginally related to these efforts.
  We begin by examining horocycles defined using the pencil of circles whose
common point (in the words of the Nielsen-Fenchel manuscript \cite{wF}) is
$\infty$. The orbits involved in this case are closed and long --- judged by
arc length between two points compared to the hyperbolic distance between them.
Using Ford circles of Farey sequences we find their lifts to the Standard
Fundamental Region (SFR) and find points of these lifts making given angles
with a horizontal. Next, we offer two algorithms, both involving continued
fractions, of locating points whose angle with the horizontal is near any
target angle and whose lifts are near any given point in the SFR.
  Next, we study the homotopy classes of horizontal horocycles as we descend to
the real axis. We find these are stable during descent between encounters of
the horizontal horocycle with elliptic fixed points. Such encounters change ---
complicate --- the homotopy classes. We give these explicitly down to height
$1/(2\sqrt{3})$.
  Finally we do an initial study of the open (infinite length) horocycle path
with unit euclidean radius anchored at $\phi -1$, where $\phi$ is the Golden
Mean. Enough information is adduced to suggest that this single doubly infinite
path is transitive.

functional freedom of choice of the inflaton potential V = |f(\phi)|^2. The
simplest model of this type has a quadratic potential m^2\phi^2/2. Another
model describes an inflaton field with the standard symmetry breaking potential
\lambda^2 (\phi^2-v^2)^2. Depending on the value of v and on initial conditions
for inflation, the spectral index n_s may take any value from 0.97 to 0.93, and
the tensor-to-scalar ratio r may span the interval form 0.3 to 0.01. A
generalized version of this model has a potential \lambda^2
(\phi^\alpha-v^\alpha)^2. At large \phi and \alpha > 0, this model describes
chaotic inflation with the power law potential \phi^{2\alpha}. For \alpha < 0,
this potential describes chaotic inflation with a potential which becomes flat
in the large field limit. We further generalize these models by introducing a
nonminimal coupling of the inflaton field to gravity. The mechanism of moduli
stabilization used in these models allows to improve and generalize several
previously considered models of chaotic inflation in supergravity.

421 with the X-ray observatory Suzaku. The analysis in this paper uses fluxes
and hardness ratios in the broad energy range from 0.5 keV to 30 keV. During
the course of the observation, the 0.5 keV - 30 keV flux decreased by a factor
of $\sim$2 and was accompanied by several large flares occurring on timescales
of a few hours. We find that fitting a broken power model to spectra from
isolated epochs during the observation describes the data well. Different
flares exhibit different spectral and hardness ratio evolutions. The cumulative
observational evidence indicates that the particle acceleration mechanism in
the Mrk 421 jet produces electron energy distributions with a modest range of
spectral indices and maximum energies. We argue that the short-timescale X-ray
spectral variability in the flares can be attributed mostly to intrinsic
changes in the acceleration process, dominating other influences such as
fluctuations in the Doppler beaming factor, or radiative cooling in or outside
the acceleration zone.

developing a relativistic formalism, consistent with that used to define the

K(m_pi/2) is the sum of all irreducible contributions to nucleon-nucleon

O_1B for plane wave initial states. For distorted waves, we find that the usual
operator is replaced with a sum of two-body operators that are well
approximated by the operator O_2B. Our new formalism solves the (previously
ignored) problem of energy transfer forbidding a one-body impulse operator.
Using a purely one pion exchange deuteron, the net result is that the impulse
amplitude for np --> d pi^0 at threshold is enhanced by a factor of
approximately two. This amplitude is added to the larger ""rescattering""
amplitude and, although experimental data remain in disagreement, the
theoretical prediction of the threshold cross section is brought closer to (and

formation of a group of galaxies with sufficient resolution to track the
evolution of gas and stars inside about a dozen galaxy group members over
cosmic history. Galaxy groups, which harbor many elliptical galaxies in the
universe, are a particularly promising environment to investigate morphological
transformation and star formation quenching, due to their high galaxy density,
their relatively low velocity dispersion, and the presence of a hot intragroup
medium. Our simulation reproduces galaxies with different Hubble morphologies
and, consequently, enables us to study when and where the morphological
transformation of galaxies takes place. The simulation does not include
feedback from active galactic nuclei showing that it is not an essential
ingredient for producing quiescent, red elliptical galaxies in galaxy groups.
Ellipticals form, as suspected, through galaxy mergers. In contrast with what
has often been speculated, however, these mergers occur at z>1, before the
merging progenitors enter the virial radius of the group and before the group
is fully assembled. The simulation also shows that quenching of star formation
in the still star-forming elliptical galaxies lags behind their morphological
transformation, but, once started, is taking less than a billion years to
complete. As long envisaged the star formation quenching happens as the
galaxies approach and enter the finally assembled group, due to quenching of
gas accretion and (to a lesser degree) stripping. A similar sort is followed by
unmerged, disk galaxies, which, as they join the group, are turned into the
red-and-dead disks that abound in these environments.

supernova flash powering of the ORs. The electron density of the emitting gas

also the [N II] temperature remains fairly constant at ~ 1.2*10^4 K. We find no
obvious difference in density and temperature for the two ORs. The highest
density, as measured from the decay of H{\alpha}, could, however, be ~ 5*10^3
cm^-3, and since the decay is somewhat faster for the southern outer ring than
for the northern, the highest density in the ORs may be found in the southern
outer ring. For an assumed distance of 50 kpc to the supernova, the distance
between the supernova and the closest parts of the ORs could be as short as ~
1.7*10^18 cm. Interaction between the supernova ejecta and the outer rings
could therefore start in less than ~ 20 years. We do not expect the ORs to show
the same optical display as the equatorial ring when this happens.

the field of view ($5^{\circ}$ radius) of the 21 Centimeter Array (21CMA), by
carrying out Monte-Carlo simulations to model redshifted cosmological
reionization signals and strong contaminating foregrounds, including emissions
from our Galaxy, galaxy clusters, and extragalactic point sources. As an
improvement of previous works, we consider in detail not only random variations
of morphological and spectroscopic parameters within the ranges allowed by
multi-band observations, but also evolution of radio halos in galaxy clusters,
assuming that relativistic electrons are re-accelerated in the ICM in merger
events and lose energy via both synchrotron emission and inverse Compton
scattering with CMB photons. By introducing a new approach designed on the
basis of independent component analysis (ICA) and wavelet detection algorithm,
we prove that, with a cumulative observation of one month with the 21CMA array,
about $80\%$ of galaxy clusters with central brightness temperatures of $>
10~{\rm K}$ at 65 MHz can be safely identified and separated from the
overwhelmingly bright foreground. We find that the morphological and
spectroscopic distortions are extremely small as compared to the input
simulated clusters, and the reduced $\chi^2$ of brightness temperature profiles
and spectra are controlled to be $\lesssim 0.5$ and $\lesssim 1.3$,
respectively. These results robustly indicate that in the near future a sample
of dozens of bright galaxy clusters will be disentangled from the foreground in
21CMA observations, the study of which will greatly improve our knowledge about
cluster merger rates, electron acceleration mechanisms in cluster radio halos,
and magnetic field in the ICM.

been proposed, but no fundamental parameter set exists to describe them.
Similarly, no fundamental theory exists for dark energy to parameterize its
potential deviation from a cosmological constant. This motivates a
model-independent search for deviations from the concordance GR+LambdaCDM
cosmological model in large galaxy redshift surveys. We describe two
model-independent tests of the growth of cosmological structure, in the form of
quantities that must equal one if GR+LambdaCDM is correct. The first, epsilon,
was introduced previously as a scale-independent consistency check between the
expansion history and structure growth. The second, upsilon, is introduced here
as a test of scale-dependence in the linear evolution of matter density
perturbations. We show that the ongoing and near-future galaxy redshift surveys
WiggleZ, BOSS, and HETDEX will constrain these quantities at the 5-10% level,
representing a stringent test of concordance cosmology at different redshifts.
When redshift space distortions are used to probe the growth of cosmological
structure, galaxies at higher redshift with lower bias are found to be most
powerful in detecting deviations from the GR+LambdaCDM model.

transitions with Doppler shifts of -200 to -300 km/s, indicating a cool gas
outflow. Emission in MgII near and redward of systemic velocity, in concert
with the observed absorption, yields a P Cygni-like line profile similar to
those observed in the Ly alpha transition in Lyman Break Galaxies. Further, the
MgII emission is spatially resolved, and extends significantly beyond the
emission from stars and HII regions within the galaxy. Assuming the emission
has a simple, symmetric surface brightness profile, we find that the gas
extends to distances > ~7 kpc. We also detect several narrow FeII*
fine-structure lines in emission near the systemic velocity, arising from
energy levels which are radiatively excited directly from the ground state. We
suggest that the MgII and FeII* emission is generated by photon scattering in
the observed outflow, and emphasize that this emission is a generic prediction
of outflows. These observations provide the first direct constraints on the
minimum spatial extent and morphology of the wind from a distant galaxy.
Estimates of these parameters are crucial for understanding the impact of

the lack of data on the interaction and mobility patterns of people in the

construct a curve trading off productivity with epidemic potential. We are able
to take into account impacts on productivity that arise from social factors,

whom can commit for an infinitesimally small amount of time. We then define
policies as subgame perfect equilibrium strategies. Policies are characterized
by an integral equation which is shown to have a solution. Although we work on

preferences as long as the equations admit solutions. Numerical simulations
reveal that for the Merton problem with hyperbolic discounting, the consumption
increases up to a certain time, after which it decreases; this pattern does not

al. (2009) on helium ignition conditions on accreting neutron stars and on the
properties of the subsequent type I X-ray burst. We find that the new rate
leads to significantly lower ignition column density for accreting neutron
stars at low accretion rates. We compare the results of our ignition models for
a pure helium accretor to observations of bursts in ultra-compact X-ray binary
(UCXBs), which are believed to have nearly pure helium donors. For mdot > 0.001
mdot_Edd, the new triple-alpha reaction rate from Ogata et al. (2009) predicts
a maximum helium ignition column of ~ 3 x 10^9 g cm^{-2}, corresponding to a
burst energy of ~ 4 x 10^{40} ergs. For mdot ~ 0.01 mdot_Edd at which
intermediate long bursts occur, the predicted burst energies are at least a
factor of 10 too low to explain the observed energies of such bursts in UCXBs.
This finding adds to the doubts cast on the triple-alpha reaction rate of Ogata
et al. (2009) by the low-mass stellar evolution results of Dotter & Paxton
(2009).

be physically consistent with both data sets. The Keplerian orbit of a planet
is a highly nonlinear function of seven parameters. The astrometric orbit
problem can be partially linearized via transformation to four linear
parameters (related four Thiele-Innes constants) plus three nonlinear
parameters: eccentricity, period and periastron time. The RV orbit problem can
be partially linearized via transformation to two additional linear parameters
plus the same three nonlinear parameters. Unfortunately, the two linear
parameters from RV are not linearly related to the four linear parameters from
astrometry. Because of this difficulty, currently available algorithms for
fitting combined RV and astrometric data to multiple-planet systems employ at
least five nonlinear parameters per planet. We have developed a new algorithm
for fitting orbits of multiple planet systems from combined data sets of radial
velocity and astrometric measurements. The new algorithm satisfies the
RV-astrometry consistency requirement, while using three nonlinear parameters

  At the outset we consider spherically symmetric trees endowed with the usual
combinatorial metric (SSTs). Using a simple geometric argument we show how to
determine decent upper bounds on the generalized roundness of finite SSTs that
depend only on the downward degree sequence of the tree in question. By
considering limits it follows that if the downward degree sequence $(d_{0},
d_{1}, d_{2}...)$ of a SST $(T,\rho)$ satisfies $|\{j \, | \, d_{j} > 1 \}| =
\aleph_{0}$, then $(T,\rho)$ has generalized roundness one. Included among the
trees that satisfy this condition are all complete $n$-ary trees of depth
$\infty$ ($n \geq 2$), all $k$-regular trees ($k \geq 3$) and inductive limits
of Cantor trees.
  The remainder of the paper deals with two classes of countable metric trees
of generalized roundness one whose members are not, in general, spherically
symmetric. The first such class of trees are merely required to spread out at a
sufficient rate (with a restriction on the number of leaves) and the second
such class of trees resemble infinite combs.

a gross first approximation to configurations that follow from a suitable
smoothing out of the non-spherical part of the inhomogeneities on angular

inhomogeneous and anisotropic thus it also addresses the limitations of
spherical inhomogeneities. By using the thin-shell approximation (which means
that the Israel-Darmois continuity conditions are not fulfilled between the
shells) we construct a model of evolving cosmic structures, containing several
elongated supercluster-like structures with underdense regions between them,
which altogether provides a reasonable coarse-grained description of cosmic
structures. While this configuration is not spherically symmetric, its proper
volume average yields a spherical void profile of 250 Mpc that roughly agrees
with observations. Also, by considering a non-spherical inhomogeneity, the
definition of a ""center"" location becomes more nuanced, and thus the
constraints placed by fitting observations on our position with respect to this
location become less restrictive.

their fermionic partners. One possible choice, free of anomalies, include both
$45,\overline{45}$ representations to cancel anomalies. We review the necessary
conditions for the cancellation of anomalies and discuss the different
possibilities for supersymmetric SU(5) models. Alternative anomaly-free
combinations of Higgs representations, beyond the usual vectorlike choice, are
identified, and it is shown that their corresponding $\beta$ functions are not
equivalent. Although the unification of gauge couplings is not affected, the
introduction of multidimensional representations leads to different scenarios
for the perturbative validity of the theory up to the Planck scale. We study
the effect on the evolution of the gauge coupling up to the Planck scale due to
the different sets of fields and representations that can render an
anomaly-free model.

highly irregular and on-axisymmetric morphologies on scales $\sim$1000 AU, with
a quarter of the sample exhibiting filamentary or flattened dense structures.
Complex envelope structure is observed in regions spatially distinct from
outflow cavities, and the densest structures often show no systematic alignment

is the result of collapse from protostellar cores with initially
non-equilibrium structures. The striking non-axisymmetry in many envelopes

example, we show that the variation rate of the memristance of memristive

therefore it can change significantly with time during the learning phase. This
phenomenon can degrade the performance of learning methods like Spike
Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) and cause the corresponding neuromorphic

the topological string amplitudes. For some framed knots and links, we have
tabulated the BPS integer invariants for cross-cap $c=0$ and $c=2$ giving the
open-string topological amplitude on the orientifold of the resolved conifold.

galaxies in the Local Group via the tidal interaction of disky dwarf systems
with a larger host galaxy like the Milky Way. These progenitor disks are
embedded in extended dark halos and during the evolution both components suffer
strong mass loss. In addition, the disks undergo the morphological
transformation into spheroids and the transition from ordered to random motion
of their stars. Using collisionless N-body simulations we construct a model for
the nearby and highly elongated Sagittarius (Sgr) dSph galaxy within the
framework of the tidal stirring scenario. Constrained by the present known
orbit of the dwarf, the model suggests that in order to produce the majority of
tidal debris observed as the Sgr stream, but not yet transform the core of the
dwarf into a spherical shape, Sgr must have just passed the second pericenter
of its current orbit around the Milky Way. In the model, the stellar component
of Sgr is still very elongated after the second pericenter and morphologically
intermediate between the strong bar formed at the first pericenter and the
almost spherical shape existing after the third pericenter. This is thus the
first model of the evolution of the Sgr dwarf that accounts for its observed
very elliptical shape. At the present time there is very little intrinsic
rotation left and the velocity gradient detected along the major axis is almost
entirely of tidal origin. We model the recently measured velocity dispersion
profile for Sgr assuming that mass traces light and estimate its current total
mass within 5 kpc to be 5.2 x 10^8 M_sun. To have this mass at present, the
model requires that the initial virial mass of Sgr must have been as high as
1.6 x 10^10 M_sun, comparable to that of the Large Magellanic Cloud, which may
serve as a suitable analog for the pre-interaction, Sgr progenitor.

isochrones to the cluster sequence. Unfortunately, this parameter is often
ignored or assumed to be solar in most papers. Hence an unknown bias is
introduced in the estimation of the other three cluster parameters (age,
reddening and distance). Furthermore, studying the metallicity of open clusters
allows us not only to derive the Galactic abundance gradient on a global scale,
but also to trace the local solar environment in more detail. In a series of
three papers, we investigate the current status of published metallicities for
open clusters from widely different photometric and spectroscopic methods. A
detailed comparison of the results allows us to establish more reliable
photometric calibrations and corrections for isochrone fitting techniques. Well
established databases such as WEBDA help us to perform a homogeneous analysis
of available measurements for a significant number of open clusters. The
literature was searched for [Fe/H] estimates on the basis of photometric
calibrations in any available filter system. On the basis of results published
by Tadross, we demonstrate the caveats of the calibration choice and its
possible impact. In total, we find 406 individual metallicity values for 188
open clusters within 64 publications. The values were, finally, unweightedly
averaged. Our final sample includes [Fe/H] values for 188 open clusters.
Tracing the solar environment within 4000x4000 pc**2 we identify a patchy
metallicity distribution as an extension to the Local Bubble that significantly
influences the estimation of the Galactic metallicity gradient, even on a
global scale. In addition, further investigations of more distant open clusters
are clearly needed to obtain a more profound picture at Galactocentric
distances beyond 10 000 pc.

incorporates aging as a fundamental ingredient. The model is known to generate
earthquake sequences that quantitatively reproduce the spatial and temporal
clustering of events observed in actual seismic patterns. The aim of the
present work is to investigate if this model can give support to the empirical
evidence that earthquakes can be triggered by transient small perturbations,
particularly by the passing of seismic waves originated in events occurring in
far geographical locations. The effect of seismic waves is incorporated into
the model by assuming that they produce instantaneous small modifications in
the dynamical state of the system at the time they are applied. This change in
the dynamical state has two main effects. On one side, it induces earthquakes
that occur right at the application of the perturbation. These are called
immediate events. On the other side, after the application of the perturbation
there is a delayed effect: the seismic activity increases abruptly after the
perturbation, then falls down below the level of background activity, and
eventually recovers to the background value. The time scale of these variations
depends on the internal dynamics of the system, and is totally independent of
the duration of the perturbation. The number of delayed events in excess of the
background activity is typically observed to be around a factor of twenty
larger than the number of immediate events. The origin of the enhanced activity
period following the perturbation is associated to the existence of aging
relaxation, and it does not occur if relaxation is absent. These findings give
support to the experimental evidence that earthquake can be remotely triggered
by small transient perturbations as those produced by seismic waves.

alignments, which constitute a major astrophysical systematic in cosmological
weak lensing (cosmic shear) surveys, but also yield insight into the formation
and evolution of galaxies. We measure galaxy position-shape correlations in the
MegaZ-LRG sample for more than 800,000 luminous red galaxies, making the first
such measurement with a photometric redshift sample. In combination with a
re-analysis of several spectroscopic SDSS samples, we constrain an intrinsic
alignment model for early-type galaxies over long baselines in redshift (z ~
0.7) and luminosity (4mag). We develop and test the formalism to incorporate
photometric redshift scatter in the modelling. For r_p > 6 Mpc/h, the fits to
galaxy position-shape correlation functions are consistent with the scaling
with r_p and redshift of a revised, nonlinear version of the linear alignment
model for all samples. An extra redshift dependence proportional to (1+z)^n is
constrained to n=-0.3+/-0.8 (1sigma). To obtain consistent amplitudes for all
data, an additional dependence on galaxy luminosity proportional to L^b with
b=1.1+0.3-0.2 is required. The normalisation of the intrinsic alignment power
spectrum is found to be (0.077 +/- 0.008)/rho_{cr} for galaxies at redshift 0.3
and r band magnitude of -22 (k- and evolution-corrected to z=0). Assuming zero
intrinsic alignments for blue galaxies, we assess the bias on cosmological
parameters for a tomographic CFHTLS-like lensing survey. Both the resulting
mean bias and its uncertainty are smaller than the 1sigma statistical errors
when using the constraints from all samples combined. The addition of MegaZ-LRG
data reduces the uncertainty in intrinsic alignment bias on cosmological
parameters by factors of three to seven. (abridged)

classes in a communication network is established and investigated. Any
connection evolves in a way which depends only on its class and the state of
the network, in particular as to the route it uses among a subset of the
network nodes. It can be either active (ON) when it is transmitting data along
its route, or idle (OFF). The congestion of a given node is defined as a
functional of the transmission rates of all ON connections going through it,
and causes losses and delays to these connections. In order to control this,
the ON connections self-adaptively vary their transmission rate in TCP-like
fashion. The connections interact through this feedback loop. A Markovian model
is provided by the states (OFF, or ON with some transmission rate) of the
connections. The number of connections in each class being potentially huge, a
mean-field limit result is proved with an appropriate scaling so as to reduce
the dimensionality. In the limit, the evolution of the states of the
connections can be represented by a non-linear system of stochastic
differential equations, of dimension the number of classes. Additionally, it is
shown that the corresponding stationary distribution can be expressed by the

optimizing time averages in stochastic queueing networks subject to stability.
However, there are various definitions of queue stability in the literature,
and the most convenient Lyapunov drift conditions often provide stability and
performance bounds only in terms of a time average expectation, rather than a
pure time average. We extend the theory to show that for quadratic Lyapunov
functions, the basic drift condition, together with a mild bounded fourth
moment condition, implies all major forms of stability. Further, we show that
the basic drift-plus-penalty condition implies that the same bounds for queue
backlog and penalty expenditure that are known to hold for time average
expectations also hold for pure time averages with probability 1. Our analysis
combines Lyapunov drift theory with the Kolmogorov law of large numbers for
martingale differences with finite variance.

incompressible magnetohydrodynamic turbulence is investigated through
high-resolution direct numerical simulations and in the presence of an external
magnetic field at various intensities. For such a flow the 2D state (or slow
mode) and the 3D modes correspond respectively to spectral fluctuations in the
plan $k_\parallel=0$ and in the area $k_\parallel>0$. It is shown that if
initially the 2D state is set to zero it becomes non negligible in few turnover
times particularly when the external magnetic field is strong. The maintenance
of a large scale driving leads to a break for the energy spectra of 3D modes;
when the driving is stopped the previous break is removed and a decay phase
emerges with alfv\'enic fluctuations. For a strong external magnetic field the
energy at large perpendicular scales lies mainly in the 2D state and in all
situations a pinning effect is observed at small scales.

the low acceleration regime typical of galaxies, without the complications of
non-baryonic dark matter. Specifically, in absence of disturbing effects, e.g.
tidal heating, their velocity dispersion is expected to vanish at large radii.
If such behaviour is not observed, and in particular if, as observed in
elliptical galaxies, the dispersion is found constant at large radii below a
certain threshold acceleration, this might indicate a break down of Newtonian
dynamics.
  To minimise the effects of tidal heating in this paper we study the velocity
dispersion profile of two distant globular clusters, NGC 1851 and NGC 1904.
  The velocity dispersion profile is derived from accurate radial velocities
measurements, obtained at the ESO 8m VLT telescope. Reliable data for 184 and
146 bona fide cluster star members, respectively for NGC 1851 and NGC 1904,
were obtained.
  These data allow to trace the velocity dispersion profile up to ~2r0, where
r0 is the radius at which the cluster internal acceleration of gravity is a0 =
10e-8 cm/s/s. It is found that in both clusters the velocity dispersion becomes
constant beyond ~r0. These new results are fully in agreement with those found
for other five globular clusters previously investigated as part of this
project. Taken all together, these 7 clusters support the claim that the
velocity dispersion is constant beyond r0, irrespectively of the specific
physical properties of the clusters: mass, size, dynamical history, and
distance from the Milky Way. The strong similarly with the constant velocity
dispersion observed in elliptical galaxies beyond r0 is suggestive of a common
origin for this phenomenon in the two class of objects, and might indicate a
breakdown of Newtonian dynamics below a0.

scaling symmetry has remarkable consequences for both cosmology and elementary

Implications for the scalar field of a conformal Higgs model are considered
here. The energy-momentum tensor of a conformal Higgs scalar field determines a
cosmological constant. It has recently been shown that this accounts for the
observed magnitude of dark energy. The gravitational field equation forces the
energy density to be finite, which precludes spontaneous destabilization of the
vacuum state. Scalar field fluctuations would define a Higgs tachyon rather
than a massive particle, consistent with the ongoing failure to observe such a
particle.
