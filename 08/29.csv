typically $\sim 0.1$ ms and has a small dependence on the parameters of the

related to the rise of the maximum mass with increasing $\Delta$. As for
unpaired quark stars, the period of the fundamental mode becomes divergent at
the maximum mass but now the divergence is shifted to large masses for large

strongly affected by color superconductivity for stars with $M \gtrsim 1.5 \;

The objective is to find a preemptive schedule of minimum aggregate cost. This
problem formulation is general enough to include many natural scheduling
objectives, such as weighted flow, weighted tardiness, and sum of flow squared.
Our main result is a randomized polynomial-time algorithm with an approximation
ratio O(log log nP), where P is the maximum job size. We also give an O(1)
approximation in the special case when all jobs have identical release times.
The main idea is to reduce this scheduling problem to a particular geometric
set-cover problem which is then solved using the local ratio technique and
Varadarajan's quasi-uniform sampling technique. This general algorithmic
approach improves the best known approximation ratios by at least an
exponential factor (and much more in some cases) for essentially all of the

enables a significant performance gain over conventional shortest path routing.
Further, it outperforms cooperative communication techniques that are based on
energy accumulation. However, it requires complex and combinatorial networking
decisions concerning which nodes participate in transmission, and which decode
ordering to use. We formulate three problems of interest in this setting: (i)
minimum delay routing, (ii) minimum energy routing subject to delay constraint,
and (iii) minimum delay broadcast. All of these are hard combinatorial
optimization problems and we make use of several structural properties of their
optimal solutions to simplify the problems and derive optimal greedy
algorithms. Although the reduced problems still have exponential complexity,
unlike prior works on such problems, our greedy algorithms are simple to use
and do not require solving any linear programs. Further, using the insight

heuristics that can be implemented in polynomial time and in a distributed

both heuristics perform very close to the optimal solution over random network

gamma-ray bursts (GRB) may have internal origins, and the conventional external
shock (ES) cannot be the exclusive source of the afterglow emission. Aims: If
the central compact objects of some GRBs are millisecond magentars, the
magnetar winds could play an important role in the (internal) X-ray afterglow
emission, which is our focus here. Methods: The dynamics and the synchrotron
radiation of the termination shock (TS) of the magmnetar winds, as well as the
simultaneous GRB ES, are investigated by considering the magnetization of the
winds. Results: As a result of the competition between the emission of the wind
TS and the GRB ES, two basic types of X-ray afterglows are predicted, i.e., the
TS-dominated and the ES-dominated types. Moreover, our results also show that
both of the two types of afterglows have a shallow-decay phase and a
normal-decay one, as observed by the \textit{Swift} satellite. This indicates
that some observed X-ray afterglows could be (internally) produced by the
magnetar winds, but not necessarily GRB ESs.

to be carefully factored out, unless a special phase convention for neutrino

We choose this special flavor basis and establish some exact analytical

sub-mJy radio fields, as it results from the exploitation of multi-frequency
information available in two deep extra-galactic radio fields: the ATESP 5 GHz
sample and the First Look Survey. One of the key issues addressed here is
whether low-power AGNs are more related to efficiently accreting systems
(mostly radio-quiet) or to systems with very low accretion rates (mostly
radio-loud). The emerging picture is the following. Radio-loud jet-dominated
radio galaxies seem to be largely dominant down to flux densities of the order
of e.g. S>400 microJy. At lower flux densities (S(1.4 GHz) > 100 microJy)
radio-loud AGN are still present in significant numbers. However a population
of radio-emitting AGNs, whose properties are consistent with those expected
from existing radio-quiet AGN modeling, clearly shows up. This may indicate
that the bulk of the radio-quiet AGN population could emerge from studies of
deeper (S<100 microJy) radio samples. The radio-quiet AGN component could be
recognised thanks to the availability of IR colors which prove to be especially
useful to efficiently separate radio sources triggered by AGNs, from sources
triggered by star-formation.

lattice periodic Fano lineshape similar to what is observed in the case of
tunneling to a Kondo ion adsorbed at the surface. We show that the translation
symmetry of a clean surface in the case of \emph{weakly correlated} metals
leads to a tunneling spectrum given by the superposition of the local weighted
density of states of all energy bands involved, which does not have a Fano
lineshape. In particular the spectrum will show any hybridization gap present
in the band structure. By contrast, in a \emph{strongly correlated} heavy
fermion metal the heavy quasiparticle states will be broadened by interaction
effects. The broadening grows as one moves away from the Fermi surface, up to a
value of the order of $T_K$, the Kondo scale. We show that the hybridization
gap is completely filled in this way, and an ideal Fano lineshape of width
$T_K$ results, similar to the impurity case. We also discuss the possible
influence of the tunneling tip on the surface, in (i) leading to additional
broadening of the Fano line, and (ii) enhancing the hybridization locally,
hence adding to the impurity type behavior. The latter effects depend on the
tip-surface distance.

powerful tool for revealing the reionisation process. We study the 21 cm
cross-correlation with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature
anisotropies, focusing on the effect of the patchy reionisation. We calculate,
up to second order, the angular power spectrum of the cross-correlation between
21 cm fluctuations and the CMB kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (kSZ) from the
EoR, using an analytical reionisation model. We show that the kSZ and the 21 cm
fluctuations are anti-correlated on the scale corresponding to the typical size
of an ionised bubble at the observed redshift of the 21 cm fluctuations. The
amplitude of the angular power spectrum of the cross-correlation depends on the
fluctuations of the ionised fraction. Especially, in a highly inhomogeneous
reionisation model, the amplitude reaches the order of $100 \mu K^2$ at $\ell
\sim 3000$. We also show that second order terms may help in distinguishing
between reionisation histories.

initially depends on the probabilities of the possible inputs; however, real
time inverse arithmetic coding differs in that the user's actions are
interpreted not to navigate this probability distribution but rather to modify
it according to a learned update rule, which approximates the conditioning of
the probability distribution on the user's actions. Potential applications of

propose a new strategy, Sorting Reordered Packets with Interrupt Coalescing
(SRPIC), to reduce packet reordering in the receiver. SRPIC works in the
network device driver; it makes use of the interrupt coalescing mechanism to
sort the reordered packets belonging to the same TCP stream in a block of

Experiments have proven the effectiveness of SRPIC against forward-path
reordering.

essential role of the local cluster environment in assembling massive stars.
First we show that massive stars are formed from low mass pre-stellar cores and
become massive due to accretion. Proto-stars that benefit from this accretion
are those situated at the centre of a cluster's potential well, which is the
focal point of the contraction of the cluster gas. Given that most of the mass
which makes up a massive star in this model comes from the cluster environment
rather than the core, it is important to model the molecular cloud environment
accurately. Preliminary results of a simulation which accurately treats the
chemistry and time-dependent thermodynamics of a molecular cloud show
quantitatively similar star formation to previous models, but allow a true
comparison to be made between simulation and observations. This method can also
be applied to cases with varying metallicities allowing star formation in
primordial gas to be studied. In general, these numerical studies of clustered
star formation yield IMFs which are compatible with the Salpeter mass function.
The only possible exception to this is in low density unbound regions of
molecular clouds which lack very low and high mass stars.
