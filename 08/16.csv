our Galaxy and the only one in which hard X-ray emission has been detected. Eta
Carinae is therefore a primary candidate to search for particle acceleration by
probing its gamma-ray emission. We used the first 21 months of Fermi/LAT data
to extract gamma-ray (0.2-100 GeV) images, spectra and light-curves, then
combined them with multi-wavelength observations to model the non-thermal
spectral energy distribution. A bright gamma-ray source is detected at the
position of eta Carinae. Its flux at a few 100 MeV corresponds very well to the
extrapolation of the hard X-ray spectrum towards higher energies. The spectral
energy distribution features two distinct components. The first one extends
over the keV to GeV energy range, and features an exponential cutoff at ~ 1
GeV. It can be understood as inverse Compton scattering of ultraviolet photons
by electrons accelerated up to gamma~1E4 in the colliding wind region. The
expected synchrotron emission is compatible with the existing upper limit on
the non-thermal radio emission. The second component is a hard gamma-ray tail
detected above 20 GeV. It could be explained by pi0-decay of accelerated
hadrons interacting with the dense stellar wind. The ratio between the fluxes
of the pi0 and inverse Compton components is roughly as predicted by
simulations of colliding wind binaries. This hard gamma-ray tail can only be
understood if emitted close to the wind collision region. The energy
transferred to the accelerated particles (~5% of the collision mechanical
energy) is comparable to that of the thermal X-ray emission. We have measured
the electron spectrum responsible for the keV to GeV emission and detected an
evidence of hadronic acceleration in eta Carinae. These observations are thus
in good agreement with the colliding wind scenario suggested for eta Carinae.

Surveys high-resolution imaging campaign of 90 white dwarfs with known or

remain candidate and confirmed white dwarfs with near-infrared excess, 43 are
spatially resolved into two or more components, and a total of 12 systems are
potentially triples. There is a possible, slight deficit of earlier spectral
types (bluer colors) among the spatially unresolved companions, exactly the
opposite of expectations if significant mass is transferred to the companion
during the common envelope phase. Using the best available distance estimates,
the low mass companions to white dwarfs exhibit a bimodal distribution in
projected separation. This result supports the hypothesis that during the giant
phases of the white dwarf progenitor, any unevolved companions either migrate
inward to short periods of hours to days, or outward to periods of hundreds to
thousands of years. No intermediate projected separations of a few to several
AU are found among these pairs. However, a few double M dwarfs (within triples)
are spatially resolved in this range, empirically demonstrating that such
separations were readily detectable among the binaries with white dwarfs. A
straightforward and testable prediction emerges: all spatially unresolved, low
mass stellar and substellar companions to white dwarfs should be in short
period orbits. This result has implications for substellar companion and
planetary orbital evolution during the post-main sequence lifetime of their
stellar hosts.

scattered angular distribution will follow classical mechanics. The heavy mass
assures that the de Broglie wavelength of the incident particle in the
direction of the propagation of the particle (the parallel direction) will be
much shorter than the characteristic lattice length of the surface, thus
leading to a classical description. Recent work on molecular interferometry has
shown that by increasing the perpendicular coherence length, one may observe
interference of very heavy species passing through a grating. Here we show,
using quantum mechanical simulations, that the same effect will lead to quantum
diffraction of heavy particles colliding with a surface. We find that the
effect is robust with respect to the incident energy, the angle of incidence
and the mass of the particle. It may also be used to verify the quantum nature

many researches to obtain enough sequence reads to attempt the de novo assembly
of higher eukaryotes (including mammals). De novo assembly not only provides a
tool for understanding wide scale biological variation, but within human
bio-medicine, it offers a direct way of observing both large scale structural
variation and fine scale sequence variation. Unfortunately, improvements in the
computational feasibility for de novo assembly have not matched the
improvements in the gathering of sequence data. This is for two reasons: the
inherent computational complexity of the problem, and the in-practice memory
requirements of tools.
  Results: In this paper we use entropy compressed or succinct data structures
to create a practical representation of the de Bruijn assembly graph, which
requires at least a factor of 10 less storage than the kinds of structures used
by deployed methods. In particular we show that when stored succinctly, the de
Bruijn assembly graph for homo sapiens requires only 23 gigabytes of storage.
Moreover, because our representation is entropy compressed, in the presence of
sequencing errors it has better scaling behaviour asymptotically than
conventional approaches.

of our seemingly elective activity is actually driven by simple routines. While
the interleaving of shopping events creates randomness at the small scale, on
the whole consumer behavior is largely predictable. We also examine
income-dependent differences in how people shop, and find that wealthy
individuals are more likely to bundle shopping trips. These results validate
previous work on mobility from cell phone data, while describing the
unpredictability of behavior at higher resolution.

TeV emission has been attributed to the SNR shell, it is possibly centrally
peaked, and we hypothesize that this particularly young, energetic magnetar may
contribute to the HESS source. We also searched for pulsations from another

This has motivated experiments and observations that, so far, have been
consistent with the zero mass graviton of general relativity, but further tests
will be valuable. A basis for new tests may be the high sensitivity
gravitational wave experiments that are now being performed, and the higher
sensitivity experiments that are being planned. In these experiments it should
be feasible to detect low levels of dispersion due to nonzero graviton mass.
One of the most promising techniques for such a detection may be the pulsar
timing program that is sensitive to nano-Hertz gravitational waves.
  Here we present some details of such a detection scheme. The pulsar timing
response to a gravitational wave background with the massive graviton is
calculated, and the algorithm to detect the massive graviton is presented. We
conclude that, with 90% probability, massles gravitons can be distinguished
from gravitons heavier than $3\times 10^{-22}$ eV (Compton wave length
$\lambda_{\rm g}=4.1 \times 10^{12}$ km), if biweekly observation of 60 pulsars
are performed for 5 years with pulsar RMS timing accuracy of 100 ns. If 60
pulsars are observed for 10 years with the same accuracy, the detectable
graviton mass is reduced to $5\times 10^{-23}$ eV ($\lambda_{\rm g}=2.5 \times
10^{13}$ km); for 5-year observations of 100 or 300 pulsars, the sensitivity is
respectively $2.5\times 10^{-22}$ ($\lambda_{\rm g}=5.0\times 10^{12}$ km) and
$10^{-22}$ eV ($\lambda_{\rm g}=1.2\times 10^{13}$ km). Finally, a 10-year

switches smoothly the isotropic magnet to the easy-plane magnet. We demonstrate
that the quasielastic neutron scattering spectrum in the crossover regime
combines properties of both limiting cases. We also consider a quantum

light curves remains a mystery, especially those cases with a long-lived
plateau followed by an abrupt falloff. In this paper, we propose a mechanism to
understand the origin of the abrupt falloff after plateau by considering
solidification of newborn quark stars with latent heat released as energy
injection to GRB afterglow. We estimate the total latent heat released during
the phase transition of quark stars from liquid to solid states, to be order of
~ 10^{51}ergs, which is comparable to the emission energy in the shallow decay
segment. We also estimate the time scale of radiating the latent heat through
thermal photon emission, and find that the time scale agrees with observations.
Based on our estimation, we analyze the process of energy injection to GRB
afterglow. We show that the steady latent heat of quark star phase transition
would continuously inject into GRB afterglow in a form similar to that of a
Poyntingflux- dominated outflow and naturally produce the shallow decay phase
and the abrupt falloff after plateau. We conclude that the latent heat of quark
star phase transition would be an important contribution to the shallow decay
radiation in GRB afterglow, and would explain the general features of GRB light
curves (including the plateau), if pulsar-like stars are really (solid) quark
stars.

Recently, Menasche et al. has shown that bundling is a promising solution to
mitigate this availability problem; it improves the availability and reduces
download times for unpopular contents by combining multiple files into a single
swarm. There also have been studies on bundling strategies and performance
issues in bundled swarms. In spite of the recent surge of interest in the
benefits of and strategies for bundling, there are still little empirical
grounding for understanding, describing, and modeling it. This is the first
empirical study that measures and analyzes how prevalent contents bundling is
in BitTorrent and how peers access the bundled contents, in comparison to the
other non-bundled (i.e., single-filed) ones. To our surprise, we found that
around 70% of BitTorrent swarms contain multiple files, which indicate that
bundling has become widespread for contents sharing. We also show that the
amount of bytes shared in bundled swarms is estimated to be around 85% out of
all the BitTorrent contents logged in our datasets. Inspired from our findings,
we raise and discuss three important research questions in the field of file
sharing systems as well as future contents-oriented networking: i) bundling
strategies, ii) bundling-aware sharing systems in BitTorrent, and iii)
implications on content-oriented networking.

for drag reduction in turbulent wall flows recently introduced by Quadrio et
al. [J. Fluid Mech., v.627, 161, (2009)]. The technique consists in generating
streamwise-modulated waves of spanwise velocity at the wall, that travel in the
streamwise direction.
  A proof-of-principle experiment has been devised to measure the reduction of
turbulent friction in a pipe flow, in which the wall is subdivided into thin
slabs that rotate independently in the azimuthal direction. Different speeds of
nearby slabs provide, although in a discrete setting, the desired streamwise
variation of transverse velocity.
  Our experiment confirms the available DNS results, and in particular
demonstrates the possibility of achieving large reductions of friction in the
turbulent regime. Reductions up to 33% are obtained for slowly
forward-traveling waves; backward-traveling waves invariably yield drag
reduction, whereas a substantial drop of drag reduction occurs for waves
traveling forward with a phase speed comparable to the convection speed of
near-wall turbulent structures.
  A Fourier analysis is employed to show that the first harmonics introduced by
the discrete spatial waveform that approximates the sinusoidal wave are
responsible for significant effects that are indeed observed in the
experimental measurements. Practical issues related to the physical
implementation of this control scheme and its energetic efficiency are briefly
discussed.

formed under partial frequency redistribution (PRD) in two thermal models of

influence of several atmospheric parameters on the emergent fractional linear
polarization profiles. The shapes of these $Q/I$ profiles are interpreted in
terms of the anisotropy of the radiation field, which in turn depends on the
source function gradient that sets the angular variation of the specific
intensity. We define a suitable frequency integrated anisotropy factor for PRD
that can be directly related to the emergent linear polarization. We show that
complete frequency redistribution is a good approximation to model weak
resonance lines. We also show that the emergent linear polarization profiles
can be very sensitive to the thermal structure of the solar atmosphere and, in
particular, to spatial variations of the damping parameter.

shows that a Symmetric K-PPDR network and its equivalent Semi Symmetric K-PPDR

results are true for Cycle K-PPDR and Semi Cycle K-PPDR networks. Also the
obtained optimal transition probabilities have been compared with the

too long time, the average correlations are smeared out and no security can be
inferred. Therefore, finite-key analysis is necessary to find the maximal

approach to solve Maxwell's equations for the PCB power and ground plane
configuration. The simulation domain is terminated with a uniaxial perfectly
matched layer to prevent unwanted reflections. This approach calculates the
field values as a function of position and time and allows the evolution of the
field to be visualized. The propagation of a pulse over the ground plane was
observed demonstrating the establishment of a complex interference pattern
between source and reflected wave fronts and then between multiply reflected
wave fronts. This interference which affects the whole ground plane area could
adversely affect the operation of any device on the board. These resonant waves
persist for a significant time after the initial pulse. Examining the FFT of
the ground plane electric field response showed numerous resonant peaks at
frequencies consistent with the expected values assuming the PCB can be
modelled as a resonant cavity with two electric and four magnetic field

state of the accumulation wire from the edge state wavefunctions. At high
magnetic fields, the coupling between the three subsystems increases as a
function of the applied magnetic field, in contrast to coplanar

several authors in order to meet various observed binary characteristics better
than conservative evolution does. Since Algols are eclipsing binaries the
distribution of their orbital periods is precisely known. The distribution of
their mass ratios contains however more uncertainties. We try to reproduce
these two distributions theoretically using a liberal scenario in which the
gainer star can lose mass into interstellar space as a consequence of its rapid
rotation and the energy of a hot spot. In a recent paper (Van Rensbergen et al.
2010, A&A) we calculated the liberal evolution of binaries with a B-type
primary at birth where mass transfer starts during core hydrogen burning of the
donor. In this paper we include the cases where mass transfer starts during
hydrogen shell burning and it is our aim to reproduce the observed
distributions of the system parameters of Algol-type semi-detached systems. Our
calculations reveal the amount of time that an Algol binary lives with a well
defined value of mass ratio and orbital period. We use these data to simulate
the distribution of mass ratios and orbital periods of Algols. Binaries with a
late B-type initial primary hardly lose any mass whereas those with an early B
primary evolve in a non-conservative way. Conservative binary evolution
predicts only ~ 12 % of Algols with a mass ratio q above 0.4. This value is
raised up to ~ 17 % using our scenario of liberal evolution, which is still far
below the ~ 45 % that is observed. Observed orbital periods of Algol binaries
larger than one day are faithfully reproduced by our liberal scenario. Mass

new statistic, the curvature, and the conversion to temperature calibrated
using a suite of hydrodynamic simulations. At each redshift we focus on
obtaining the temperature at an optimal overdensity probed by the Lyman-alpha
forest, T(Delta), where the temperature is nearly a one-to-one function of the
curvature regardless of the slope of the temperature-density relation. The
median 2-sigma statistical uncertainty in these measurements is 8 per cent,
though there may be comparable systematic errors due to the unknown amount of
Jeans smoothing in the IGM. We use our T(Delta) results to infer the
temperature at the mean density, T0. Even for a maximally steep
temperature-density relation, T0 must increase from ~8000 K at z ~ 4.4 to
>~12000 K at z ~ 2.8. This increase is not consistent with the monotonic
decline in T0 expected in the absence of He II reionization. We therefore
interpret the observed rise in temperature as evidence of He II reionization
beginning at z >~ 4.4. The evolution of T0 is consistent with an end to He II
reionization at z ~ 3, as suggested by opacity measurements of the He II
Lyman-alpha forest, although the redshift at which T0 peaks will depend
somewhat on the evolution of the temperature-density relation. These new
temperature measurements suggest that the heat input due to the reionization of
He II dominates the thermal balance of the IGM over an extended period with
Delta_z >~ 1.

atomic impurities in nanotubes as well as for creating nanosized proton beams

extrasolar planets is markedly different from the solar system. Among other
scenarios considered, it has been proposed that eccentricity may grow through
planet-disc interaction. Recently, it has been noticed that the thermodynamical
state of the disc can significantly influence the migration properties of
growing protoplanets. However, the evolution of planetary eccentricity in
radiative discs has not been considered yet. In this paper we study the
evolution of planets on eccentric orbits that are embedded in a
three-dimensional viscous disc and analyse the disc's effect on the orbital
evolution of the planet. We use the three-dimensional hydrodynamical code
NIRVANA that includes full tensor viscosity and implicit radiation transport in
the flux-limited diffusion approximation. The code uses the FARGO-algorithm to
speed up the simulations. First we measure the torque and power exerted on the
planet by the disc for fixed orbits, and then we let the planet start with
initial eccentricity and evolve it in the disc. For locally isothermal we
confirm previous results and find eccentricity damping and inward migration for
planetary cores. In the case of radiative discs, the planets experience an
inward migration as long as its eccentricity lies above a certain threshold.
After the damping of eccentricity cores with masses below 33 Earthmasses begin
to migrate outward in radiative discs, while higher mass cores always migrate
inward. For all planetary masses studied (up to 200 Earthmasses) we find
eccentricity damping. In viscous discs the orbital eccentricity of embedded
planets is damped during the evolution independent of the mass. Hence,
planet-disc interaction does not seem to be a viable mechanism to explain the
observed high eccentricity of exoplanets.

of the Galaxy is still unknown. One intriguing possibility is that the
accretion flow onto the central supermassive black hole is responsible for
accelerating protons to TeV energies which then diffuse outward to interact
with molecular gas at distances of ~1 pc. Here, we build on our earlier
detailed calculations of the proton transport to consider the time and energy
dependence of the TeV signal following a burst of particle acceleration at Sgr
A*. We find that, due to the strong energy dependence of the proton diffusion,
any variability in the particle acceleration rate will only be visible in the
TeV signal after a delay of ~ 10 yrs, and only at energies >~ 10 TeV. If the
accelerator is long-lived it must have been running for at least 10^4 yrs and
have a hard proton injection spectrum of \alpha=0.7 (where dn/dE_inj \propto
E^{-\alpha}) in order to produce the correct amount of high energy gamma-ray
flux. This rapid diffusion of high energy protons also rules out the
possibility that the observed TeV source is directly related to the period of
increased activity of Sgr A* that ended ~ 100 yrs ago. However, a good fit to
the observed H.E.S.S. data was found with \alpha=2.7 for the scenario of a
brief (~few year long) burst of particle acceleration that occurred ~ 10 yrs
ago. If such bursts are common then they will keep the TeV source energised and
will likely produce spectral variability at >~ 10 TeV on <~ 5 yr timescales.
This model also implies that particle acceleration may be an important

extremely luminous optical transients. The initial discoveries of SN 2005ap by
the Texas Supernova Search and SCP-06F6 in a deep Hubble pencil beam survey
were followed by the Palomar Transient Factory confirmation of host redshifts
for other similar transients. The transients share the common properties of
high optical luminosities (peak magnitudes ~ -21 to -23), blue colors, and a
lack of H or He spectral features. The physical mechanism that produces the
luminosity is uncertain, with suggestions ranging from jet-driven explosion to
pulsational pair-instability. Here we report the most detailed photometric and
spectral coverage of an ultra-bright transient (SN 2010gx) detected in the
Pan-STARRS 1 sky survey. In common with other transients in this family,
early-time spectra show a blue continuum, and prominent broad absorption lines
of O II. However, about 25d after discovery, the spectra developed type Ic
supernova features, showing the characteristic broad Fe II and Si II absorption
lines. Detailed, post-maximum follow-up may show that all SN 2005ap and
SCP-06F6 type transients are linked to supernovae Ic. This poses problems in
understanding the physics of the explosions: there is no indication from
late-time photometry that the luminosity is powered by 56Ni, the broad
lightcurves suggest very large ejected masses, and the slow spectral evolution
is quite different from typical Ic timescales. The nature of the progenitor
stars and the origin of the luminosity are intriguing and open questions.

high-quality observations show for the first time that the overall majority of
PRGs at intermediate redshifts (78-85%) show peculiarities in their optical
morphologies at relatively high levels of surface brightness ($\mu$v=23.6 and
{\Delta}$\mu$v~[21,26] mag arcsec-2) including tails, fans, bridges, shells,
dust lanes, irregular features, amorphous haloes, and multiple nuclei. While
the results for many of the galaxies are consistent with them being observed
at, or after, the time of coalescence of the nuclei in a galaxy merger, we find
that more than 1/3 of the sample are observed in a pre-coalescence phase of the
merger, or following a close encounter between galaxies. By dividing the sample
into Weak-Line Radio Galaxies (WLRGs; 11 objects) and Strong-Line Radio
Galaxies (SLRGs; 35 objects) we find that only 27% of the former show clear
evidence for interactions in their optical morphologies, in contrast to the
SLRGs, of which at least 94% appear interacting. This is consistent with the
idea that many WLRGs are fuelled/triggered by Bondi accretion of hot gas. Of
the 28% of the sample that display evidence for significant starburst activity,
we find that 92% present disturbed morphologies, following the same general
trend as the total and SLRG samples. By comparing our PRGs with various samples
of quiescent ellipticals from the literature, we conclude that the percentage
of morphological disturbance that we find here exceeds that found for quiescent
ellipticals when similar surface brightnesses are considered. Overall, our
study indicates that galaxy interactions are likely to play a key role in the
triggering of AGN/jet activity.

weight of variable assignments for every complex-weighted Boolean constraint
satisfaction problem (or CSP) with any number of additional unary (i.e., arity
1) constraints, particularly, when degrees of input instances are bounded from
above by a fixed constant. All degree-1 counting CSPs are obviously solvable in
polynomial time. When the instance's degree is more than two, we present a
dichotomy theorem that classifies all counting CSPs admitting free unary
constraints into exactly two categories. This classification theorem extends,
to complex-weighted problems, an earlier result on the approximation complexity
of unweighted counting Boolean CSPs of bounded degree. The framework of the
proof of our theorem is based on a theory of signature developed from Valiant's
holographic algorithms that can efficiently solve seemingly intractable
counting CSPs. Despite the use of arbitrary complex weight, our proof of the
classification theorem is rather elementary and intuitive due to an extensive
use of a novel notion of limited T-constructibility. For the remaining degree-2
problems, in contrast, they are as hard to approximate as Holant problems,
which are a generalization of counting CSPs.

phenomenon lies in understanding the mechanism of the formation of electron
pairs. Paired electrons, however, cannot form a superconducting condensate
spontaneously. These paired electrons perform disorderly zero-point
oscillations and there are no force of attraction in their ensemble. In order
to create a unified ensemble of particles, the pairs must order their
zero-point fluctuations so that an attraction between the particles appears. As
a result of this ordering of zero-point oscillations in the electron gas,
superconductivity arises. This model of condensation of zero-point oscillations
creates the possibility of being able to obtain estimates for the critical
parameters of elementary superconductors, which are in satisfactory agreement
with the measured data. On the another hand, the phenomenon of superfluidity in
He-4 and He-3 can be similarly explained, due to the ordering of zero-point
fluctuations. It is therefore established that both related phenomena are based
on the same physical mechanism.

Since $\gamma$ is now scale and time dependent, both the amplitude and transfer

complicated than previously thought. Outflows are observed primarily in
emission lines from Fe XI - Fe XV. Observations at lower temperatures (Si VII),
in contrast, show bright fan-like structures that are dominated by downflows.
The morphology of the outflows is also different than that of the fans. This

exhibits a reasonable convergence. Our main emphasis is laid on the control
over the uncertainties in the decay constants, related both to the input QCD
parameters and to the limited accuracy of the method of sum-rules. This becomes
possible due to the application of our procedure of extracting hadron
observables that involves as novel feature dual thresholds depending on the

precise value of mb(mb). By requiring our sum-rule estimate to match the
average of the lattice results for f_B, a very accurate value mb(mb)=4.245\pm

computational problems have gained broad interest in disparate arenas. In the
current work, we focus on the ""community detection"" problem when cast in terms
of a general Potts spin glass type problem. As such, our results apply to
rather broad Potts spin glass type systems. Community detection describes the
general problem of partitioning a complex system involving many elements into
optimally decoupled ""communities"" of such elements. We report on phase
transitions between solvable and unsolvable regimes. Solvable region may
further split into ""easy"" and ""hard"" phases. Spin glass type phase transitions
appear at both low and high temperatures (or noise). Low temperature
transitions correspond to an ""order by disorder"" type effect wherein
fluctuations render the system ordered or solvable. Separate transitions appear
at higher temperatures into a disordered (or an unsolvable) phase. Different
sorts of randomness lead to disparate behaviors. We illustrate the spin glass
character of both transitions and report on memory effects. We further relate
Potts type spin systems to mechanical analogs and suggest how chaotic-type
behavior in general thermodynamic systems can indeed naturally arise in
hard-computational problems and spin-glasses. The correspondence between the
two types of transitions (spin glass and dynamic) is likely to extend across a
larger spectrum of spin glass type systems and hard computational problems. We
briefly discuss potential implications of these transitions in complex many
