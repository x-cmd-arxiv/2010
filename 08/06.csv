Arguably the most direct of these is to place stars on the H-R diagram and
compare their positions with stellar evolutionary models. Even so, the masses
one infers from this depend upon the exact methodology used. I briefly
discusssome of the caveats and go through a brief error analysis. I conclude
that the current data suggest that the IMF slopes are the same to within the
errors. Similarly the determination of the upper mass ""limit"" is dependent upon
how well one can determine the masses of the most massive stars within a
cluster. The recent finding by Crowther et al (2010) invalidates the claim that
there is a 150Mo upper limit to the IMF, but this is really not surprising
given the weakness of the previous evidence.

polymer matrix can be controlled by grafting polymer chains to the nanoparticle
surface. As a first step to study this situation, we have used molecular
dynamics simulations on a single nanoparticle of radius R ($4\sigma \le$R$\le
16\sigma$, where $\sigma$ is the diameter of a polymer monomer) grafted with
chains of length 500 in a polymer melt of chains of length 1000. The grafting
density $\Sigma$ was varied between $0.04$-$0.32$ chains/$\sigma^2$. To
facilitate equilibration a Monte Carlo double-bridging algorithm is applied -
new bonds are formed across a pair of chains, creating two new chains each
substantially different from the original. For the long brush chains studied
here, the structure of the brush assumes its large particle limit even for $R$
as small as 8$\sigma$, which is consistent with recent experimental findings.
We study autophobic dewetting of the melt from the brush as a function of
increasing $\Sigma$. Even these long brush and matrix chains of length $6$ and
$12$ $N_e$, respectively, (the entanglement length is $N_e \sim 85$) give
somewhat ambiguous results for the interfacial width, showing that studies of
two or more nanoparticles are necessary to properly understand these
miscibility issues. Entanglement between the brush and melt chains were
identified using the primitive path analysis. We find that the number of
entanglements between the brush and melt chains scale simply with the product
of the local monomer densities of brush and melt chains.

observing conditions (sky noise, point-spread function and atmospheric
transparency) based on years of recorded conditions at the DES site.
Simulations of non-Ia type SNe are based on spectroscopically confirmed light
curves that include unpublished non-Ia samples donated from the Carnegie
Supernova Project (CSP), the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS), and the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey-II (SDSS-II). A spectroscopically confirmed subset was
provided for training. We challenged scientists to run their classification
algorithms and report a type and photo-z for each SN. Participants from 10
groups contributed 13 entries for the sample that included a host-galaxy
photo-z for each SN, and 9 entries for the sample that had no redshift
information. Several different classification strategies resulted in similar
performance, and for all entries the performance was significantly better for
the training subset than for the unconfirmed sample. For the spectroscopically
unconfirmed subset, the entry with the highest average figure of merit for
classifying SNe~Ia has an efficiency of 0.96 and an SN~Ia purity of 0.79. As a
public resource for the future development of photometric SN classification and
photo-z estimators, we have released updated simulations with improvements
based on our experience from the SNPCC, added samples corresponding to the

an observed companion in a binary system has already been suggested almost four
decades ago. However, these predictions were made even before the first
observations of gravitational lensing, whereas nowadays gravitational
microlensing surveys towards the Galactic bulge yield almost 1000 events per
year where one star magnifies the light of a more distant one. With a specific
view on those experiments, we therefore carry out simulations to assess the
prospects for detection of the transient periodic magnification of the
companion star, which lasts typically only a few hours binaries involving a
main-sequence star. We find that detectability is given by the achievability of
dense monitoring with the required photometric accuracy. In sharp contrast to
earlier expectations by other authors, we find that main-sequence stars are not
substantially less favourable targets to observe this effect than white dwarfs.
The requirement of an almost edge-on orbit leads to a probability of the order
of $3 \times 10^{-4}$ for spotting the signature of an existing compact object
in a binary system with this technique. Assuming an abundance of such systems
about 0.4 per cent, a high-cadence monitoring every 15~min with 5 per cent
photometric accuracy would deliver a signal rate per target star of $\gamma
\sim 4 \times 10^{-7}~\mbox{yr}^{-1}$ at a recurrence period of about 6 months.
With microlensing surveys having demonstrated the capability to monitor about
$2 \times 10^{8}$ stars, one is therefore provided with the chance to detect
roughly semi-annually recurring self-lensing signals from several compact
compacts in a binary system. If the photometric accuracy was pushed down to 0.3
per cent, 10 times as many signals would become detectable.

complements, then they are fibered with the same genus and are chiral. A

the operation of CR nodes with transmission requests. The probability density

power and contention controls are jointly adopted by a CR node to govern its

two schemes by simulations. Then, the interference distributions under the
first two control schemes are fitted by log-normal distributions with greatly
reduced complexity. Moreover, the effect of a hidden primary receiver on the
interference experienced at the receiver is investigated. It is demonstrated
that both power and contention controls are effective approaches to alleviate
the interference caused by CR networks. Some in-depth analysis of the impact of

The break occurs at a scale around 100-200 pc. We interpret this break as the
scale height of the dust disk of the LMC. We perform high resolution
simulations with and without stellar feedback. Our AMR hydrodynamic simulations
of model galaxies using the LMC mass and rotation curve, confirm that they have
similar two-component power-laws for projected density and that the break does
indeed occur at the disk thickness. Power spectral analysis of velocities
betrays a single power law for in-plane components. The vertical component of
the velocity shows a flat behavior for large structures and a power law similar
to the in-plane velocities at small scales. The motions are highly anisotropic
at large scales, with in-plane velocities being much more important than
vertical ones. In contrast, at small scales, the motions become more isotropic.

estimate of the actual steering vector, which then is used for obtaining the
optimal beamforming weight vector. The objective for finding such an estimate
of the actual signal steering vector is the maximization of the beamformer
output power, while the constraints are the normalization condition and the
requirement that the estimate of the steering vector does not converge to an
interference steering vector. Our objective and constraints are free of any
design parameters of non-unique choice. The resulting optimization problem is a
non-convex quadratically constrained quadratic program, which is NP hard in
general. However, for our problem we show that an efficient solution can be
found using the semi-definite relaxation technique. Moreover, the strong
duality holds for the proposed problem and can also be used for finding the
optimal solution efficiently and at low complexity. In some special cases, the
solution can be even found in closed-form. Our simulation results demonstrate
the superiority of the proposed method over other previously developed robust
adaptive beamforming methods for several frequently encountered types of signal

for a derivation of the column density profile and total enclosed mass of

from these absorption profiles range from 0.2-4.5 solar masses. Millimeter
continuum emission indicates a mass of about 2 solar masses, both from a direct
calculation assuming isothermal dust and from dust radiative transfer models
constrained by the millimeter observations. We use dust radiative transfer
models to constrain the internal luminosity of L673-7, defined to be the
luminosity of the central source and excluding the luminosity from external
heating, to be 0.01-0.045 solar luminosities, with 0.04 solar luminosities the
most likely value. L673-7 is thus classified as a very low luminosity object
(VeLLO), and is among the lowest luminosity VeLLOs yet studied. We calculate
the kinematic and dynamic properties of the molecular outflow in the standard
manner, and we show that the expected accretion luminosity based on these
outflow properties is greater than or equal to 0.36 solar luminosities. The
discrepancy between this expected accretion luminosity and the internal
luminosity derived from dust radiative transfer models indicates that the

realized in the cold vacuum, i.e. at zero temperature and density -- is a
consequence of a nonminimal coupling of the $\rho$ mesons to the

that the shift in time, $\exp (Kt)$, is also a symmetric operator. This
generates the reciprocity relations between the kinetic curves. For example,
for the Master equation, if we start the process from the $i$th pure state and
measure the probability $p_j(t)$ of the $j$th state ($j\neq i$), and,
similarly, measure $p_i(t)$ for the process, which starts at the $j$th pure

similar and more general reciprocal relations between the kinetic curves. The
experimental evidence provided as an example is from the reversible water gas

thermal energy generation in AGNs originates off axis in regions that cannot be
axially symmetric. This off-axis model readily explains the varying degrees of
temporal correlation found in multi-wavelength variability studies, the strong,
variable asymmetry of BLR line profiles, the varying time delays in the
response of the BLR to different continuum events, how narrow velocity ranges
of line profiles will often appear to respond differently or not at all to
continuum variability, complex changes in the Balmer decrement with velocity,
inconsistent and variable inflow/outflow signatures found in velocity-resolved
reverberation mapping, the diversity of velocity-dependent polarizations
observed, and polarization variability. The fundamentally non-axisymmetric
nature of AGN continuum variability severely limits what can be learned from
reverberation mapping. In particular, high-fidelity reverberation mapping is
not possible. There will be systematic orientation-dependent errors in black

follow-up one to two months after detection. Using this survey data alone, we
have measured the luminosity function of the Kuiper belt, thus avoiding any
biases that might come from the inclusion of other observations. We have found
that the Cold population defined as having inclinations less than 5 degrees has
a luminosity function slope alpha=0.82+-0.23, and is different from the Hot
population, which has inclinations greater than 5 degrees and a luminosity
function slope alpha=0.35+-0.21. As well, we have found that those objects
closer than 38 AU have virtually the same luminosity function slope as the Hot

demonstrates that the dynamically cold Kuiper belt objects likely have a steep
size distribution, and are unique from all of the excited populations which
have much shallower distributions. This suggests that the dynamically excited
population underwent a different accretion history and achieved a more evolved
state of accretion than the cold population. As well, we discuss the
similarities of the Cold and Hot populations with the size distributions of
other planetesimal populations. We find that while the Jupiter family comets

extrapolation to small sizes for the scattered disk cannot account for the

emission from their cores is not accompanied by enough cold gas or star
formation. A continuous energy source is required to balance the cooling rate
over the whole core volume. We address the feasibility of a gravitational
heating mechanism, utilizing the gravitational energy released by the gas that
streams into the potential well of the cluster dark-matter halo. We focus here
on a specific form of gravitational heating in which the energy is transferred
to the medium thorough the drag exerted on inflowing gas clumps. Using
spheri-symmetric hydro simulations with a subgrid representation of these
clumps, we confirm our earlier estimates that in haloes >=10^13 solar masses
the gravitational heating is more efficient than the cooling everywhere. The
worry was that this could overheat the core and generate an instability that
might push it away from equilibrium. However, we find that the overheating does
not change the global halo properties, and that convection can stabilize the
cluster by carrying energy away from the overheated core. In a typical rich
cluster of 10^{14-15}solar masses, with ~5% of the accreted baryons in gas
clumps of ~10^8 solar masses, we derive upper and lower limits for the
temperature and entropy profiles and show that they are consistent with those
observed in cool-core clusters. We predict the density and mass of cold gas and
the level of turbulence driven by the clump accretion. We conclude that
gravitational heating is a feasible mechanism for preventing cooling flows in
clusters.

first departure of the redshift from the line-of-sight velocities. The
leading-order Schwarzschild terms curve space, and enter at order v^3. The
classical Keplerian phenomenology dominates the total redshift. Spectral
measurements of sufficient resolution will allow for the detection of these
post-Newtonian effects. We estimate the spectral resolution required to detect
each of these effects by fitting the redshift curve via the five keplerian
elements plus black hole mass to mock data. We play with an exaggerated S2
orbit - one with a semi-major axis a fraction of that of the real S2. This
amplifies the relativistic effects, and allows clear visual distinctions
between the relativistic terms. We argue that spectral data of S2 with a

recently been argued that when identical copies of a quantum measurement system
exist, the standard projection operators and Born rule method for calculating
probabilities must be supplemented by estimates of relative frequencies of
observers. We argue that an infinite space actually renders the Born rule
redundant, by physically realizing all outcomes of a quantum measurement in
different regions, with relative frequencies given by the square of the wave
function amplitudes. Our formal argument hinges on properties of what we term
the quantum confusion operator, which projects onto the Hilbert subspace where
the Born rule fails, and we comment on its relation to the oft-discussed
quantum frequency operator. This analysis unifies the classical and quantum
levels of parallel universes that have been discussed in the literature, and
has implications for several issues in quantum measurement theory. It also
shows how, even for a single measurement, probabilities may be interpreted as
relative frequencies in unitary (Everettian) quantum mechanics. We also argue
that after discarding a zero-norm part of the wavefunction, the remainder
consists of a superposition of indistinguishable terms, so that arguably
""collapse"" of the wavefunction is irrelevant, and the ""many worlds"" of
Everett's interpretation are unified into one. Finally, the analysis suggests a
""cosmological interpretation"" of quantum theory in which the wave function
describes the actual spatial collection of identical quantum systems, and
quantum uncertainty is attributable to the observer's inability to self-locate

derivative of the anomalous dimension matrix with respect to the coupling. We
use integrability techniques to compute the one-loop couplings a_LAB between
the Lagrangian and two distinct large operators built with Magnons, in the
SU(2) sector of the theory. Then we consider a_DAA at strong coupling, and show
how to compute it using the gauge/gravity duality, when D is a chiral operator
dual to any supergravity field and O_A is dual to a heavy string state. We
exemplify for the Lagrangian and operators O_A dual to heavy string states,
showing agreement with the prediction derived from the renormalization group
arguments.

ionising radiation in smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations that we
introduced in Pawlik & Schaye (2008). The new version keeps all advantages of
the original implementation: photons are transported at the speed of light, in
a photon-conserving manner, directly on the spatially adaptive, unstructured
grid traced out by the particles, in a computation time that is independent of
the number of radiation sources, and in parallel on distributed memory
machines. We extend the method to include multiple frequencies, both hydrogen
and helium, and to model the coupled evolution of the temperature and
ionisation balance. We test our methods by performing a set of simulations of
increasing complexity and including a small cosmological reionisation run. The
results are in excellent agreement with exact solutions, where available, and
also with results obtained with other codes if we make similar assumptions and
account for differences in the atomic rates used. We use the new implementation
to illustrate the differences between simulations that compute photoheating in
the grey approximation and those that use multiple frequency bins. We show that
close to ionising sources the grey approximation asymptotes to the
multi-frequency result if photoheating rates are computed in the optically thin
limit, but that the grey approximation breaks down everywhere if, as is often
done, the optically thick limit is assumed.

a member of a class of Galactic SNRs which feature X-ray spectra dominated by
non-thermal emission: in the cases of these SNRs, the emission is believed to
have a synchrotron origin and studies of the X-ray spectra of these SNRs can
lend insights into how SNRs accelerate cosmic-ray particles. The Chandra
observations have clearly revealed fine structure in this rim complex and the
spectra of these features are dominated by non-thermal emission. We have
measured the length scales of the upstream structures at eight positions along
the rim and derive lengths of 0.02-0.08 pc (assuming a distance of 750 pc to
G266.2-1.2). We have also extracted spectra from seven regions in the rim
complex and fit these spectra with such models as a simple power law as well as
the synchrotron models SRCUT and SRESC. We have constrained our fits to the
latter two models using estimates for the flux densities of these filaments at
1 GHz as determined from radio observations made with the Australia Telescope
Compact Array (ATCA). Statistically-acceptable fits to all seven regions are
derived using each model: differences in the fit parameters (such as photon
index and cutoff frequency) are seen in the different regions, which may
indicate variations in shock conditions and the maximum energies of the
cosmic-ray electrons accelerated at each region. Finally, we estimate the
maximum energy of cosmic-ray electrons accelerated along this rim complex to be
approximately 40 TeV. We include a summary of estimated maximum energies for

in seven Semi-Analytic Models (SAMs) of galaxy formation, including a new model
we propose in this paper. We use versions of the models without feedback and
apply them to dark matter haloes growing in a cosmological context, which have
final masses that range from 10^{11}Msun to 10^{14}Msun. First, using
simplified smoothly-growing halo models, we demonstrate that the different
algorithms predict cooling rates and final cold gas masses that differ by a
factor of ~5 for massive haloes (>10^{12}Msun). The algorithms are in better
agreement for less massive haloes because they cool efficiently and, therefore,
their cooling rates are largely limited by the halo accretion rate. However,
for less massive haloes, all the SAMs predict less cooling than corresponding
1D hydrodynamic models. Second, we study the gas accretion history of the
central galaxies of dark matter haloes using merger trees. The inclusion of
mergers alters the cooling history of haloes by locking up gas in galaxies
within small haloes at early times. For realistic halo models, the dispersion
in the cold gas mass predicted by the algorithms is 0.5 dex for high mass
haloes and 0.1 dex for low mass haloes, while the dispersion in the accretion
rate is about two times larger. Comparing to cosmological SPH simulations, we
find that most SAMs systematically under-predict the gas accretion rates for
low-mass haloes but over-predict the gas accretion rates for massive haloes.
Although the models all include both ""rapid"" and ""slow"" mode accretion, the
transition between the two accretion modes varies between models and also
differs from the simulations. Finally, we construct a new model that explicitly
incorporates cold halo gas to illustrate that such a class of models can better
match the results from cosmological hydrodynamic simulations.

a mathematically exact deconvolution of the moments of the apparent brightness
distribution of galaxies from the telescope's PSF. No assumptions on the shape
of the galaxy or the PSF are made. The (de)convolution equations are exact for
unweighted moments only, while in practice a compact weight function needs to
be applied to the noisy images to ensure that the moment measurement yields
significant results. We employ a Gaussian weight function, whose centroid and
ellipticity are iteratively adjusted to match the corresponding quantities of
the source. The change of the moments caused by the application of the weight
function can then be corrected by considering higher-order weighted moments of
the same source. Because of the form of the deconvolution equations, even an
incomplete weighting correction leads to an excellent shear estimation if
galaxies and PSF are measured with a weight function of identical size. We
demonstrate the accuracy and capabilities of this new method in the context of
weak gravitational lensing measurements with a set of specialized tests and
show its competitive performance on the GREAT08 challenge data. A complete C++
implementation of the method can be requested from the authors.

attains capacity when all the terminals seek to share a key, and, in general,
attains at least half the capacity. Third, when a single ``helper'' terminal
assists the remaining ``user'' terminals in generating a perfect secret key, we
give necessary and sufficient conditions for the optimality of the algorithm;

CO are a very robust diagnostic in the study of circumstellar envelopes (CSEs).
When sampling different layers of the CSE, observations of these molecular
lines lead to detailed profiles of kinetic temperature, expansion velocity, and
density. A state-of-the-art, nonlocal thermal equilibrium, and co-moving frame
radiative transfer code that predicts CO line intensities in the CSEs of
late-type stars is used in deriving relations between stellar and
molecular-line parameters, on the one hand, and mass-loss rate, on the other.
We present analytical expressions for estimating the mass-loss rates of evolved
stellar objects for 8 rotational transitions of the CO molecule, apply them to
our extensive CO data set covering 47 stars, and compare our results to those
of previous studies. Our expressions account for line saturation and resolving
of the envelope, thereby allowing accurate determination of very high mass-loss
rates. We argue that, for estimates based on a single rotational line, the
CO(2-1) transition provides the most reliable mass-loss rate. The mass-loss
rates calculated for the AGB stars range from 4x10^-8 Msun/yr up to 8x10^-5
Msun/yr. For RSGs they reach values between 2x10^-7 Msun/yr and 3x10^-4
Msun/yr. The estimates for the set of CO transitions allow time variability to
be identified in the mass-loss rate. Possible mass-loss-rate variability is
traced for 7 of the sample stars. We find a clear relation between the
pulsation periods of the AGB stars and their derived mass-loss rates, with a
levelling off at approx. 3x10^-5 Msun/yr for periods exceeding 850 days.

$\sim0.3\Re<{\rm R}_{pl}<12\Re$ and orbital periods $2{\rm h}<P<15{\rm d}$,
equivalent to orbital radii $0.003{\rm AU} < a < 0.1{\rm AU}$. For Gaussian
random noise WASP is sensitive to transits by companions as small as the Moon
orbiting a $\textrm{V}\simeq$12 white dwarf. For fainter white dwarfs WASP is
sensitive to increasingly larger radius bodies. However, in the presence of
correlated noise structure in the light-curves the sensitivity drops, although
Earth-sized companions remain detectable in principle even in low S/N data.
Mars-sized, and even Mercury-sized bodies yield reasonable detection rates in
high-quality light-curves with little residual noise. We searched for eclipses
and transit signals in long-term light-curves of a sample of 194 white dwarfs
resulting from a cross-correlation of the McCook $&$ Sion catalogue and the
WASP archive. No evidence for eclipsing or transiting sub-stellar and planetary
companions was found. We used this non-detection and results from our
simulations to place tentative upper limits to the frequency of such objects in
close orbits at white dwarfs. While only weak limits can be placed on the
likely frequency of Earth-sized or smaller companions, brown dwarfs and gas
giants (radius $\approx \Rjup$) with periods $<0.1-0.2$ days must certainly be
rare ($<10%$). More stringent constraints likely requires significantly larger
white dwarf samples, higher observing cadence and continuous coverage. The
short duration of eclipses and transits of white dwarfs compared to the cadence
of WASP observations appears to be one of the main factors limiting the
detection rate in a survey optimised for planetary transits of main sequence
stars.

period behavior than G dwarfs. The giants in the sample have distinctive
quasi-periodic behavior, but are not periodic in the way we define it. Not all
periodicities are due to rotation, and the most significant period is not
necessarily the rotation period. We discuss properties of the lightcurves, and
in particular look at a sample of very clearly periodic G dwarfs. It is clear
that a large number of them do vary because of rotation and starspots, but it
will take further analysis to fully exploit this.

density over five years of observations, culminating in the B pulsar's radio
disappearance in 2008 March. Over this time, the flux density decreases by
0.177 mJy/yr at the brightest orbital phases and the pulse profile evolves from
a single to a double peak, with a separation rate of 2.6 deg/yr. The pulse
profile changes are most likely caused by relativistic spin precession, but can
not be easily explained with a circular hollow-cone beam as in the model of
Clifton & Weisberg (2008). Relativistic spin precession, coupled with an
elliptical beam, can model the pulse profile evolution well. This particular
beam shape predicts geometrical parameters for the two bright orbital phases
which are consistent and similar to those derived by Breton et al. (2008).
However, the observed decrease in flux over time and B's eventual disappearance
cannot be easily explained by the model and may be due to the changing
influence of A on B.

deal of discussion in the literature regarding the role of quasars, both as
sources of reionization, and as probes of the ionization state of the IGM.
However the extreme ultra-violet (EUV) spectral index cannot be measured
directly for high redshift quasars owing to absorption at frequencies above the
Lyman limit, and as a result, studies of the impact of quasars on the
intergalactic medium during reionization must assume a spectral energy
distribution in the extreme ultra-violet based on observations at low redshift,
z<1. In this paper we use regions of high Ly-alpha transmission (near-zones)
around the highest redshift quasars to measure the quasar EUV spectral index at
z~6. We jointly fit the available observations for variation of near-zone size
with both redshift and luminosity, and propose that the observed relation
provides evidence for an EUV spectral index that varies with absolute magnitude
in the high redshift quasar sample, becoming softer at higher luminosity. Using
a large suite of detailed numerical simulations we find that the typical value
of spectral index for a luminous quasar at z~6 is constrained to be
alpha=1.3+/-0.4 for a specific luminosity of the form L\propto\nu^{-alpha}. We
find the scatter in spectral index among individual quasars to be in the range
~0.75-1.25. These values are in agreement with direct observations at low
redshift, and indicate that there has been no significant evolution in the EUV
spectral index of quasars over 90% of cosmic time.

Herbig-Haro objects (HH 54/211/212, L 1157/1448, BHR 71). Our analysis
includes: (1) comparisons in morphology between the four IRAC bands (3.6, 4.5,
5.8 and 8.0 um), and H2 1-0 S(1) at 2.12 um for three out of six objects; (2)
measurements of spectral energy distributions (SEDs) at selected positions; and
(3) comparisons of these results with calculations of thermal H2 emission at
LTE (207 lines in four bands) and non-LTE (32-45 lines, depending on particle
for collisions). We show that the morphologies observed at 3.6 and 4.5 um are
similar to each other, and to H2 1-0 S(1). This is well explained by thermal H2
emission at non-LTE if the dissociation rate is significantly larger than
0.002-0.02, allowing thermal collisions to be dominated by atomic hydrogen. In
contrast, the 5.8 and 8.0 um emission shows different morphologies from the
others in some regions. This emission appears to be more enhanced at the wakes
in bow shocks, or less enhanced in patchy structures in the jet. These
tendencies are explained by the fact that thermal H2 emission in the 5.8 and
8.0 um band is enhanced in regions at lower densities and temperatures.
Throughout, the observed similarities and differences in morphology between
four bands and 1-0 S(1) are well explained by thermal H2 emission. The observed
SEDs are categorized into:- (A) those in which the flux monotonically increases
with wavelength; and (B) those with excess emission at 4.5-um. The type-A SEDs
are explained by thermal H2 emission, in particular with simple shock models
with a power-law cooling function. Our calculations suggest that the type-B
SEDs require extra contaminating emission in the 4.5-um band. The CO
vibrational emission is the most promising candidate, and the other
contaminants discussed to date are not likely to explain the observed SEDs.

the storage times possible, and the small ensemble volumes would enable large

However, Nadai's analysis of stress distribution in a planar sand heap was

This raises a question about the validity of his observation in relation to the

found in Nadai's solution by analyzing a radially symmetric stress field for a
wedge-shaped sand heap with the purpose of satisfying both force balance and

qualitatively is of the utmost difficulty and importance. As time is
incorporated into the proper structure of the fabric of spacetime, it is
interesting to note that General Relativity is contaminated with non-trivial
geometries which generate closed timelike curves. A closed timelike curve (CTC)
allows time travel, in the sense that an observer that travels on a trajectory
in spacetime along this curve, may return to an event before his departure.
This fact apparently violates causality, therefore time travel and it's
associated paradoxes have to be treated with great caution. The paradoxes fall
into two broad groups, namely the consistency paradoxes and the causal loops. A
great variety of solutions to the Einstein field equations containing CTCs
exist and it seems that two particularly notorious features stand out.
Solutions with a tipping over of the light cones due to a rotation about a
cylindrically symmetric axis and solutions that violate the energy conditions.

  December 2010, Auckland, New Zealand",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In order to understand whether, and to what extent, spectral representation
can effectively highlight the nonlinear interaction among different scales, it
is necessary to consider the state that precedes the onset of instabilities and
turbulence in flows. In this condition, a system is still stable, but is
however subject to a swarming of arbitrary 3D small perturbations. These can
arrive any instant, and then undergo a transient evolution which is ruled out
by the initial-value problem associated to the Navier-Stokes linearized
formulation. The set of 3D small perturbations constitutes a system of multiple
spatial and temporal scales which are subject to all the processes included in
the perturbative Navier-Stokes equations: linearized convective transport,
linearized vortical stretching and tilting, and the molecular diffusion.
Leaving aside nonlinear interaction among the different scales, these features
are tantamount to the features of the turbulent state. We determine the
exponent of the inertial range of arbitrary longitudinal and transversal
perturbations acting on a typical shear flow, i.e. the bluff-body wake. Then,
we compare the present results with the exponent of the corresponding developed
turbulent state (notoriously equal to -5/3). For longitudinal perturbations, we
observe a decay rate of -3 in the inertial range, typically met in
two-dimensional turbulence. For purely 3D perturbations, instead, the energy
decreases with a factor of -5/3. If we consider a combination of longitudinal
and transversal perturbative waves, the energy spectrum seems to have a decay
of -3 for larger wavenumbers ([50, 100]), while for smaller wavenumbers
([3,50]) the decay is of the order -5/3. We can conclude that the value of the
exponent of the inertial range has a much higher level of universality, which
is not necessarily associated to the nonlinear interaction.

Heisenberg model, with an antiferromagnetic exchange coupling $J \approx 5$

$S=1/2$ doublets of opposite chirality. Due to lack of inversion symmetry in
the molecule these two states are coupled by an external electric field, even
when spin-orbit interaction is absent. The spin-electric coupling can be viewed
as originating from a modified exchange constant $\delta J$ induced by the
electric field. We find that the calculated transition rate between the chiral
states yields an effective electric dipole moment $d = 3.38\times 10^{-33} {\rm

which we suggest a simple method to adjust for growth when trying to recover a
juvenile's fingerprint in a database years later. Based on longitudinal data
sets in juveniles' criminal records, we show that growth essentially leads to
an isotropic rescaling, so that we can use the strong correlation between
growth in stature and limbs to model the growth of fingerprints proportional to
stature growth as documented in growth charts. The proposed rescaling leads to
a 72% reduction of the distances between corresponding minutiae for the data
set analyzed. These findings were corroborated by several verification tests.
In an identification test on a database containing 3.25 million right index
fingers at the Federal Criminal Police Office of Germany, the identification
error rate of 20.8% was reduced to 2.1% by rescaling. The presented method is
of striking simplicity and can easily be integrated into existing automated

modulation equation, for small amplitude nonlinear waves consisting of slow
modulations of time-periodic linear oscillations. The fully-nonlinear and
unilateral interactions between beads yield a nonstandard modulation equation
that we call the discrete p-Schroedinger (DpS) equation. It consists of a
spatial discretization of a generalized Schroedinger equation with p-Laplacian,
with fractional p>2 depending on the exponent of Hertz's contact force. We show
that the DpS equation admits explicit periodic travelling wave solutions, and
numerically find a plethora of standing wave solutions given by the orbits of a
discrete map, in particular spatially localized breather solutions. Using a
modified Lyapunov-Schmidt technique, we prove the existence of exact periodic
travelling waves in the chain of beads, close to the small amplitude modulated
waves given by the DpS equation. Using numerical simulations, we show that the
DpS equation captures several other important features of the dynamics in the
weakly nonlinear regime, namely modulational instabilities, the existence of
static and travelling breathers, and repulsive or attractive interactions of
these localized structures.

Microfluidic crystals, formed by the introduction of droplets of immiscible

develop models to describe non-equilibrium dynamics2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,

in which viscous dissipation of energy dominates inertial effects, vibrations
are expected to be over-damped and contribute little to their dynamics12, 13,

vibrational modes (equivalent to acoustic 'phonons') in a one-dimensional

propagate at an ultra-low sound velocity of approx100 mum s-1 and frequencies
of a few hertz, exhibit unusual dispersion relations markedly different to
those of harmonic crystals, and give rise to a variety of crystal instabilities
that could have implications for the design of commercial microfluidic systems.
First-principles theory shows that these phonons are an outcome of the
symmetry-breaking flow field that induces long-range inter-droplet
interactions, similar in nature to those observed in many other systems

For both systems, we find that about 25% of the Fe sites are reduced to Fe2+

This discrepancy is ascribed to the fact that the charge transfer occurs on the

intercalated atom or molecule is involved in the charge-transfer process, thus
making this process a prerequisite for intercalation. The Fe2+ fraction is
found to increase with pressure for polyaniline-FeOCl, hinting at an
enhancement of the conductivity in the FeOCl intercalation compounds under

of C*-algebras would imply a positive answer to this question for all bipartite
scenarios. This remains true also if one considers not only spatial
correlations, but also spatiotemporal correlations, where each party is allowed
to apply their measurements in temporal succession; we provide an example of a

local, while the spatiotemporal correlations reveal nonlocality. Moreover, we

scenario, is equivalent to the QWEP conjecture. This extended version can be
conveniently formulated in terms of steering the system of a third party.

cavity. A spherical model is simultaneously fit to STEREO EUVI and COR1 data of
an impulsively accelerated CME on 25 March 2008, which displays a well-defined
extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and white-light cavity of nearly circular shape
already at low heights ~ 0.2 Rs. The center height h(t) and radial expansion
r(t) of the cavity are obtained in the whole height range of the main
acceleration. We interpret them as the axis height and as a quantity
proportional to the minor radius of a flux rope, respectively. The
three-dimensional expansion of the CME exhibits two phases in the course of its
main upward acceleration. From the first h and r data points, taken shortly
after the onset of the main acceleration, the erupting flux shows an
overexpansion compared to its rise, as expressed by the decrease of the aspect
ratio from k=h/r ~ 3 to k ~ (1.5-2.0). This phase is approximately coincident
with the impulsive rise of the acceleration and is followed by a phase of very
gradual change of the aspect ratio (a nearly self-similar expansion) toward k ~
1.5 at h ~ 10 Rs. The initial overexpansion of the CME cavity can be caused by
flux conservation around a rising flux rope of decreasing axial current and by
the addition of flux to a growing, or even newly forming,flux rope by magnetic
reconnection. Further analysis will be required to decide which of these
contributions is dominant. The data also suggest that the horizontal component
of the impulsive cavity expansion (parallel to the solar surface) triggers the
associated EUV wave, which subsequently detaches from the CME volume.

discussed. We formulate a conjecture as to how the stress-energy tensor of the
underlying gauge theory couples to the string degrees of freedom. A consequence
of the conjecture is that the energy density and the longitudinal-stress
operators measure the distribution of the transverse position of the string, to
leading order in the string fluctuations, whereas the transverse-stress
operator does not. We interpret recent numerical measurements of the transverse
size of the confining string and show that the difference of the energy and
longitudinal-stress operators is the appropriate probe to use when comparing
with the next-to-leading order string prediction. Secondly we derive the
constraints imposed by open-closed string duality on the transverse structure
of the string. We show that a total of three independent `gravitational' form
factors characterize the transverse profile of the closed string, and obtain
the interpretation of recent effective string theory calculations: the square
radius of a closed string of length \beta, defined from the slope of its
gravitational form factor, is given by (d-1)/(2\pi\sigma)\log(\beta/(4r_0)) in
d space dimensions. This is to be compared with the well-known result that the
width of the open-string at mid-point grows as (d-1)/(2\pi\sigma) log(r/r_0).

of distorting the anisotropies at all scales, as shown by Challinor and Van

independently our local motion by using off-diagonal two-point correlation
functions for high multipoles. We study the observability of the signal for
temperature and polarization anisotropies. We point out that Planck can measure
the velocity $\beta$ with an error of about 30% and the direction with an error
of about 20 degrees. This method constitutes a cross-check, which can be useful
to verify that our CMB dipole is due mainly to our velocity or to disentangle
the velocity from other possible intrinsic sources. Although in this paper we
focus on our peculiar velocity, a similar effect would result also from other
intrinsic vectorial distortion of the CMB which would induce a dipolar lensing.
Measuring the off-diagonal correlation terms is therefore a test for a
preferred direction on the CMB sky.

there exists a continuous trend for political science to gradually become a

partial solutions is continuous and satisfies the boundary conditions, we have
to solve a system of linear equations. Our idea is to first solve a bidiagonal
system related to the original system of linear equations, and then update it
with the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury formula. We study the feasibility, the
numerical stability and the running time of this method. The results are: The
method described above has the same stability problems like the well known
Condensing method. The running time analysis shows that the new method is
slower than the Condensing method. Therefore we recommend not to use the method

Potts model in terms of the spin clusters (i.e., connected domains where the
spin takes a constant value). These clusters are different from the usual
Fortuin-Kasteleyn clusters, and are separated by domain walls that can cross
and branch. We develop a transfer matrix technique enabling the formulation and
numerical study of spin clusters even when Q is not an integer. We further
identify geometrically the crossing events which give rise to conformal
correlation functions. This leads to an infinite series of fundamental critical
exponents h_{l_1-l_2,2 l_1}, valid for 0 </- Q </- 4, that describe the
insertion of l_1 thin and l_2 thick domain walls.

characteristic zero. An element $x$ of $\g$ is said to have an \emph{abstract
Jordan-Chevalley decomposition} if there exist unique $s,n\in\g$ such that
$x=s+n$, $[s,n]=0$ and given any finite dimensional representation
$\pi:\g\to\gl(V)$ the Jordan-Chevalley decomposition of $\pi(x)$ in $\gl(V)$ is
$\pi(x)=\pi(s)+\pi(n)$.
  In this paper we prove that $x\in\g$ has an abstract Jordan-Chevalley
decomposition if and only if $x\in [\g,\g]$, in which case its semisimple and
nilpotent parts are also in $[\g,\g]$ and are explicitly determined. We derive
two immediate consequences: (1) every element of $\g$ has an abstract
Jordan-Chevalley decomposition if and only if $\g$ is perfect; (2) if $\g$ is a
Lie subalgebra of $\gl(n,k)$ then $[\g,\g]$ contains the semisimple and
nilpotent parts of all its elements. The last result was first proved by
Bourbaki using different methods.
  Our proof only uses elementary linear algebra and basic results on the
representation theory of Lie algebras, such as the Invariance Lemma and Lie's
Theorem, in addition to the fundamental theorems of Ado and Levi.

from cloud structure is investigated with fractal Brownian motion (fBm) clouds
that have power-law power spectra. An fBm cloud with a realistic projected
power spectrum slope of $\beta=2.8$ is found to have a mass function for clumps
exceeding a threshold density that is a power-law with a slope of
$\alpha=2.35$, the same as in the Salpeter IMF. Any hierarchically structured
cloud has a clump mass function with about the same slope. This result implies
that turbulent interstellar clouds produce dense substructure with the observed
pre-stellar core mass function built in from the start. Details of the clump
formation processes are not critical. The conversion of clumps into stars
involves a second step. A one-to-one correspondence between clump mass and star
mass is not necessary to convert the clump mass spectrum into an IMF with the
same power-law slope. As long as clumps have an internal stellar IMF from
sub-fragmentation, protostellar accretion, coalescence and other processes, and
the characteristic mass for this internal IMF scales with the clump mass, then
the IMF slope above the minimum characteristic mass will equal the clump mass
slope. A detailed review of IMF models illustrates the prominence of cloud
structure as a major component in a wide class of theories. Tests are proposed
to determine the relative importance of cloud structure and competitive
accretion in the IMF.

oxygen composition in the current galactic gas and in the solar atmosphere
(i.e., the former being appreciably lower by ~0.3 dex) apparently contradicting
the galactic chemical evolution, we carried out oxygen abundance determinations
for 64 mid- through late-B stars by using the O I 6156-8 lines while taking
into account the non-LTE effect, and compared them with the solar O abundance
established in the same manner. The resulting mean oxygen abundance was <A(O)>
= 8.71 (+/- 0.06), which means that [O/H] (star-Sun differential abundance) is
~-0.1, the difference being less significant than previously thought. Moreover,
since the 3D correction may further reduce the reference solar oxygen abundance
(8.81) by ~0.1 dex, we conclude that the photospheric O abundances of these B
stars are almost the same as that of the Sun. We also determined the non-LTE
abundances of neon for the sample B stars from Ne I 6143/6163 lines to be
<A(Ne)> = 8.02 (+/- 0.09), leading to the Ne-to-O ratio of ~0.2 consistent with
the recent studies. This excludes a possibility of considerably high Ne/O ratio

Young (1977) considers an ""absurdity"". Removing this absurdity results in a new
rule (Fishburn, 1977) for which we can compute the winner in polynomial time
(Rothe et al., 2003), unlike the traditional Dodgson rule. We call this rule DC
and introduce two new related rules (DR and D&). Dodgson did not explicitly
propose the ""Dodgson rule"" (Tideman, 1987); we argue that DC and DR are better
realizations of the principle behind the Dodgson rule than the traditional
Dodgson rule. These rules, especially D&, are also effective approximations to
the traditional Dodgson's rule. We show that, unlike the rules we have
considered previously, the DC, DR and D& scores differ from the Dodgson score
by no more than a fixed amount given a fixed number of alternatives, and thus
these new rules converge to Dodgson under any reasonable assumption on voter
behaviour, including the Impartial Anonymous Culture assumption.

theory, absorbs Joule heat precisely as a semi-infinite harmonic substrate
would. Simulating stick-slip friction of a slider over a 2D Lennard-Jones
solid, we compare our virtually exact frictional results with approximate ones
from commonly adopted empirical dissipation schemes. While the latter are
generally in serious error, we show that the exact results can be closely
reproduced by a viscous Langevin dissipation at the boundary layer, once the
back-reflected frictional energy is variationally optimized.
