persistent emission of magnetars within a self consistent, physical scenario.
We present the predictions of a synthetic model that we calculated with a new
Monte Carlo 3-D radiative code. The basic idea is that soft thermal photons
(e.g. emitted by the star surface) can experience resonant cyclotron
upscattering by a population of relativistic electrons threated in the twisted
magnetosphere. Our code is specifically tailored to work in the
ultra-magnetized regime; polarization and QED effects are consistently
accounted for, as well different configurations for the magnetosphere. We
discuss the predicted spectral properties in the 0.1-1000 keV range, the
polarization properties, and we present the model application to a sample of
magnetars soft X-ray spectra.

Standard Model of particle physics was developed from stringent constraints
imposed by flavour changing processes between quarks, the detailed structure of
any new physics is severely constrained by flavour processes. In order to
elucidate this structure it is necessary to perform a number of complementary
studies of a set of golden channels. With these measurements in hand, the
pattern of deviations from the Standard Model behavior can be used as a test of
the structure of new physics. If new physics is found at the LHC, then the many
golden measurements from SuperB will help decode the subtle nature of the new
physics. However if no new particles are found at the LHC, SuperB will be able
to search for new physics at energy scales up to 10-100 TeV. In either
scenario, flavour physics measurements that can be made at SuperB play a
pivotal role in understanding the nature of physics beyond the Standard Model.
Examples for using the interplay between measurements to discriminate New
Physics models are discussed in this document. SuperB is a Super Flavour
Factory, in addition to studying large samples of B_{u,d,s}, D and tau decays,
SuperB has a broad physics programme that includes spectroscopy both in terms
of the Standard Model and exotica, and precision measurements of sin^2theta_W.
In addition to performing CP violation measurements at the Y(4S) and phi(3770),
SuperB will test CPT in these systems, and lepton universality in a number of
different processes. The multitude of rare decay measurements possible at
SuperB can be used to constrain scenarios of physics beyond the Standard Model.

model on a honeycomb lattice with periodic boundary conditions; these layers
are stacked such that the links of the lattice intersect each other. A complex
Boltzmann weight $\lambda$ with unit modulus is assigned to each intersection
of two loops each from each layer. The model is reduced to an inhomogeneous
vertex model at a special point of parameters. The continuum partition function
is represented, based on the idea of the Coulomb gas, by a path integral over
two compact bosonic fields. The modular invariance of the partition function
follows naturally. Further, because of the topological nature of the interlayer

The existence of the latter leads to a sum over all the pairs of torus knots,
which can be Poisson ressummed by the M\""{o}bius inversion formula. This
reveals the operator content of the theory. The multiplicity of each operator

ago. We detect a weak nucleus with an SED typical of a low-luminosity AGN with
a bolometric luminosity of 2.4x10^42 erg/s. The Spitzer IRAC and MIPS images
show dust emission strongest in regions with little or no radio emission. The
large infrared luminosity relative to the galaxy's K-band luminosity implies an
external origin for the dust. The dust mass implies that the merger spiral

Chandra images show a small ~15""(1.6 kpc) cavity coincident with the radio jet,

east and west of the nucleus, each approximately 230""(25 kpc) in radius. The
radio lobes lie at radii of 14.3'(93 kpc) and 15.6'(101 kcp), more distant from
the nucleus than the detected X-ray cavities. The relative morphology of the
large scale 1.4 GHz and X-ray emission suggests they were products of two
distinct outbursts, an earlier one creating the radio lobes and a later one
producing the X-ray cavities. Alternatively, if a single outburst created both
the X-ray cavities and the radio lobes, this would require that the morphology
is not fully defined by the 1.4 GHz emission. For the more likely two outburst
scenario, we use the buoyancy rise times to estimate an age for the more recent
outburst of 0.1 Gyr and use the associated PV work done by the expanding plasma
to create the X-ray cavities to estimate the outburst's energy of 10^58 ergs.
The present size and location of the large radio lobes implies that the AGN
outburst that created them happened ~0.4 Gyr ago and released ~5x10^58 ergs.

momentum transport generated by the gravitational instability using the
phenomenology of viscosity. This allows the employment of the standard viscous
evolution equations, and gives promising results. It is, however, still not
clear when such an approximation is appropriate. This paper tests this
approximation using high resolution 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH)
simulations of self-gravitating protostellar discs with radiative transfer. The
nature of angular momentum transport associated with the gravitational
instability is characterised as a function of both the stellar mass and the
disc-to-star mass ratio. The effective viscosity is calculated from the
Reynolds and gravitational stresses in the disc. This is then compared to what
would be expected if the effective viscosity were determined by assuming local
thermodynamic equilibrium or, equivalently, that the local dissipation rate
matches the local cooling rate. In general, all the discs considered here
settle into a self-regulated state where the heating generated by the
gravitational instability is modulated by the local radiative cooling. It is
found that low-mass discs can indeed be represented by a local
""alpha-parametrisation"", provided that the disc aspect ratio is small (H/R <
0.1) which is generally the case when the disc-to-star mass ratio q <0.5.
However, this result does not extend to discs with masses approaching that of
the central object. These are subject to transient burst events and global wave
transport, and the effective viscosity is not well modelled by assuming local
thermodynamic equilibrium. In spite of these effects, it is shown that massive
(compact) discs can remain stable and not fragment, evolving rapidly to reduce
their disc-to-star mass ratios through stellar accretion and radial spreading.

closed field lines. In an attempt to understand the hard component better,
X-ray data were obtained at six roughly equally spaced phases within the same

We revisit this approach and show how far it can be transferred to hermitian

threshold. We study a game theoretic approach towards capacity maximization
introduced by Andrews and Dinitz (INFOCOM 2009) and Dinitz (INFOCOM 2010). We
prove vastly improved bounds for the game theoretic algorithm. In doing so, we
achieve the first distributed constant factor approximation algorithm for
capacity maximization for the uniform power assignment. When compared to the
optimum where links may use an arbitrary power assignment, we prove a $O(\log
\Delta)$ approximation, where $\Delta$ is the ratio between the largest and the
smallest link in the network. This is an exponential improvement of the
approximation factor compared to existing results for distributed algorithms.
All our results work for links located in any metric space. In addition, we
provide simulation studies clarifying the picture on distributed algorithms for
capacity maximization.

three schemes for channel identification: unentangled probes, probes maximally

the probe is circulated back through the channel before measurement. Compared
on the basis of (quantum Fisher) information gained per channel use, we find
broadly that entanglement with an ancilla dominates the other two schemes, but
only if entanglement is cheap relative to the cost per channel use and only if
the external ancilla is well shielded from depolarization. We arrive at these

following. (1) The time profile of the coronal helicity shows a good
correlation with that of the helicity accumulation by injection through the
surface. (2) The coronal helicity of the AR is estimated to be
-4.3$\times$10$^{43}$ Mx$^{2}$ just before the X3.4 flare. (3) This flare is
preceded not only by a large increase of negative helicity,
-3.2$\times$10$^{43}$ Mx$^{2}$, in the corona over ~1.5 days but also by
noticeable injections of positive helicity though the photospheric surface
around the flaring magnetic polarity inversion line during the time period of
the channel structure development. We conjecture that the occurrence of the

a generalized form of extensivity that can be defined for a number of

that the application of magnetic field destroys the d-wave superconducting gap
to uncover a Fermi surface that behaves like a conventional (i.e.Fermi Liquid)
metal (1). Another view is that an applied magnetic field destroys long range
superconducting phase coherence, but the superconducting gap amplitude survives

the conventional temperature dependence and quantum oscillations expected for a

quasi-particle density of states follows a \sqrt{H} behavior that persists
right through the zero-resistance transition, evidencing the fully developed

separating features in the data produced by astrophysical sources from features
produced by the detector. Matched filtering provides an optimal solution for
Gaussian noise, but in practice, transient noise excursions or ``glitches''
complicate the analysis. Detector diagnostics and coincidence tests can be used
to veto many glitches which may otherwise be misinterpreted as gravitational
wave signals. The glitches that remain can lead to long tails in the matched
filter search statistics and drive up the detection threshold. Here we describe
a Bayesian approach that incorporates a more realistic model for the instrument
noise allowing for fluctuating noise levels that vary independently across
frequency bands, and deterministic ``glitch fitting'' using wavelets as
``glitch templates'', the number of which is determined by a trans-dimensional
Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. We demonstrate the method's effectiveness
on simulated data containing low amplitude gravitational wave signals from
inspiraling binary black hole systems, and simulated non-stationary and
non-Gaussian noise comprised of a Gaussian component with the standard
LIGO/Virgo spectrum, and injected glitches of various amplitude, prevalence,
and variety. Glitch fitting allows us to detect significantly weaker signals
than standard techniques.

in the blue cloud migrate rapidly to the red sequence within around a Gyr,
passing through several phases of increasingly strong AGN activity in the
process (Schawinski et al. 2007, MNRAS, 382, 1415; S07 hereafter). We show that
natural depletion of the gas reservoir through star formation (i.e. in the
absence of any feedback from the AGN) induces a blue-to-red reddening rate that
is several factors lower than that observed in S07. This is because the gas
depletion rate due to star formation alone is too slow, implying that another
process needs to be invoked to remove gas from the system and accelerate the
reddening rate. We develop a simple phenomenological model, in which a fraction
of the AGN's luminosity couples to the gas reservoir over a certain 'feedback
timescale' and removes part of the gas mass from the galaxy, while the
remaining gas continues to contribute to star formation. We use the model to
investigate scenarios which yield migration times consistent with the results
of S07. We find that acceptable models have feedback timescales <0.2 Gyrs. The
mass fraction in young stars in the remnants is <5% and the residual gas
fractions are less than 0.6%, in good agreement with the recent literature. At
least half of the initial gas reservoir is removed as the galaxies evolve from
the blue cloud to the red sequence. If we restrict ourselves to feedback
timescales similar to the typical duty cycles of local AGN (a few hundred Myrs)
then a few tenths of a percent of the luminosity of an early-type Seyfert
(10^11 LSun) must couple to the gas reservoir in order to produce migration
times that are consistent with the observations.

binaries containing post-sdB WDs and helium WDs are predicted by one of the
major binary formation channels for sdB stars. In the majority of cases, mass
transfer is expected to lead to a dynamically unstable merger event, leaving a
single-star remnant. Calculations of the evolution of these stars show that
their properties are consistent with the observed He-rich sdO stars. The
luminosity of these stars is about an order of magnitude higher than that of
canonical sdB stars. We also suggest that binary systems such as PG 1544+488

two hot subdwarfs, could be the outcome of a double-core common-envelope phase.

form the superconducting condensate, here, we develop a numerically exact
method of creating a Cooper pair of composite fermions and explicitly compute

We adopt a star formation rate (SFR) threshold normalized to the average SFR of
the individual system as a metric for classifying starbursts in SFHs derived
from resolved stellar populations. This choice facilitates finding not only
currently bursting galaxies but also ""fossil"" bursts increasing the sample size
of starburst galaxies in the nearby (D<8 Mpc) universe. Thirteen of the
eighteen galaxies are experiencing ongoing bursts and five galaxies show fossil
bursts. From our reconstructed SFHs, it is evident that the elevated SFRs of a
burst are sustained for hundreds of Myr with variations on small timescales. A
long >100 Myr temporal baseline is thus fundamental to any starburst definition
or identification method. The longer lived bursts rule out rapid
""self-quenching"" of starbursts on global scales. The bursting galaxies' gas
consumption timescales are shorter than the Hubble time for all but one galaxy
confirming the short-lived nature of starbursts based on fuel limitations.
Additionally, we find the strength of the H{\alpha} emission usually correlates
with the CMD based SFR during the last 4-10 Myr. However, in four cases, the
H{\alpha} emission is significantly less than what is expected for models of
starbursts; the discrepancy is due to the SFR changing on timescales of a few
Myr. The inherently short timescale of the H{\alpha} emission limits
identifying galaxies as starbursts based on the current characteristics which

flavour-changing neutral currents in the quark sector in the light of recent
data on neutral-meson mixing. We parametrise generic New Physics contributions
to B_q-Bbar_q mixing (q=d,s), in terms of one complex quantity Delta_q, while
three parameters Delta_K^tt, Delta_K^ct and Delta_K^cc are needed to describe
K-Kbar mixing. In Scenario I, we consider uncorrelated New Physics
contributions in the B_d, B_s, and K sectors. In this scenario, it is only
possible to constrain the parameters Delta_d and Delta_s whereas there are no
non-trivial constraints on the kaon parameters. In Scenario II, we study the
case of Minimal Flavour Violation (MFV) and small bottom Yukawa coupling and
Scenario III is the generic MFV case with large bottom Yukawa couplings. Our
quantitative analyses consist of global CKM fits within the Rfit frequentist
statistical approach, determining the Standard Model parameters and the new
physics parameters of the studied scenarios simultaneously. We find that the
recent measurements indicating discrepancies with the Standard Model are well
accomodated in Scenarios I and III with new mixing phases, with a slight
preference for Scenario I that permits different new CP phases in the B_d and
B_s systems. Within our statistical framework, we find evidence of New Physics
in both B_d and B_s systems. The Standard-Model hypothesis Delta_d=Delta_s=1 is
disfavoured with p-values of 3.6 sigma and 3.3 sigma in Scenarios I and III,
respectively. We also present an exhaustive list of numerical predictions in
each scenario. In particular, we predict the CP phase in B_s -> J psi phi and
the difference between the B_s and B_d semileptonic asymmetries, which will be
both measured by the LHCb experiment.

tightly confined polymer, the average length of the channel $<R_\parallel>$
occupied by the polymer and the mean square deviation from the average vary as
$<R_\parallel>=[1-\alpha_\circ(D/P)^{2/3}]L$ and $<\Delta
R_\parallel^{\thinspace 2}\thinspace>=\beta_\circ(D^2/P)L$, respectively, where
$\alpha_\circ$ and $\beta_\circ$ are dimensionless amplitudes. In earlier work
we determined $\alpha_\circ$ and the analogous amplitude $\alpha_\Box$ for a
channel with a rectangular cross section from simulations of very long chains.
In this paper we estimate $\beta_\circ$ and $\beta_\Box$ from the simulations.
The estimates are compared with exact analytical results for a semiflexible
polymer confined in the transverse direction by a parabolic potential instead
of a channel and with a recent experiment. For the parabolic confining
potential we also obtain a simple analytic result for the distribution of
$R_\parallel$ or radial distribution function, which is asymptotically exact
for large $L$ and has the skewed shape seen experimentally.

very young stars.
  Aims: To perform a detailed abundance study of the Herbig Ae star HD 101412,
taking advantage of its unusually sharp spectral lines.
  Methods: High-resolution spectra are measured for accurate wavelengths and
equivalent widths. Balmer-line fits and ionization equlibria give a relation
between Teff, and log(g). Abundance anomalies and uncertain reddening preclude
the use of spectral type or photometry to fix Teff. Excitation temperatures are
used to break the degeneracy between Teff and log(g).
  Results: Strong lines are subject to an anomalous saturation that cannot be
removed by assuming a low microturbulence. By restricting the analysis to weak
(<= 20 m[A]) lines, we find consistent results for neutral and ionized species,
based on a model with Teff = 8300K, and log(g)=3.8. The photosphere is depleted
in the most refractory elements, while volatiles are normal or, in the case of
nitrogen, overabundant with respect to the sun. The anomalies are unlike those
of Ap or Am stars.
  Conclusions: We suggest the anomalous saturation of strong lines arises from
heating of the upper atmospheric layers by infalling material from a disk. The
overall abundance pattern may be related to those found for the Lambda Boo
stars, though the depletions of the refractory elements are milder, more like
those of Vega. However, the intermediate volatile zinc is depleted, precluding
a straightforward interpretation of the abundance pattern in terms of gas-grain
separation.

related to the focal expression of a generalized thermodynamic structure. This
structure is obtained from a deformed type of statistical mechanics that arises
when configurational phase space is incompletely visited in a severe way.
Specifically, the restriction is that the accessible fraction of this space has
fractal properties. The focal expression is an (incomplete) Legendre transform
between two entropy (or Massieu) potentials that when particularized to first
digits leads to a previously existing generalization of Benford's law. The
inverse functional of this expression leads to Zipf's law; but it naturally
includes the bends or tails observed in real data for small and large rank.
Remarkably, we find that the entire problem is analogous to the transition to
chaos via intermittency exhibited by low-dimensional nonlinear maps. Our

sequential posted-pricing mechanisms (SPM)} in $K$-unit auctions, in a standard
Bayesian model. A seller has $K$ copies of an item to sell, and there are $n$
buyers, each interested in only one copy, who have some value for the item. The
seller must post a price for each buyer, the buyers arrive in a sequence
enforced by the seller, and a buyer buys the item if its value exceeds the
price posted to it. The seller does not know the values of the buyers, but have
Bayesian information about them. An SPM specifies the ordering of buyers and
the posted prices, and may be {\em adaptive} or {\em non-adaptive} in its
behavior.
  The goal is to design SPM in polynomial time to maximize expected revenue. We
compare against the expected revenue of optimal SPM, and provide a polynomial
time approximation scheme (PTAS) for both non-adaptive and adaptive SPMs. This
is achieved by two algorithms: an efficient algorithm that gives a
$(1-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi K}})$-approximation (and hence a PTAS for sufficiently
large $K$), and another that is a PTAS for constant $K$. The first algorithm
yields a non-adaptive SPM that yields its approximation guarantees against an
optimal adaptive SPM -- this implies that the {\em adaptivity gap} in SPMs
vanishes as $K$ becomes larger.

for a decentralized Markov Decision Process, with links characterized by
locally known packet drop probabilities that either remain constant on average
or change slowly. The equivalence of this optimization problem to that of
performance maximization of an explicitly constructed probabilistic automata
allows us to effectively apply the theory of quantitative measures of
probabilistic regular languages, and design a distributed highly efficient
solution approach that attempts to minimize source-to-sink drop probabilities
across the network. Theoretical results provide rigorous guarantees on global
performance, showing that the algorithm achieves near-global optimality, in
polynomial time. It is also argued that GODDeS is significantly
congestion-aware, and exploits multi-path routes optimally. Theoretical
development is supported by high-fidelity network simulations.

interacts with the RHNs via a very heavy field exchange and then we can explain
the cosmic ray anomalies. With the second right-handed neutrino N_2 dominant

obtain the vacuum expectation values around the TeV scale, and then the
lightest state from \phi_{1,2} is the decay DM with lifetime around \sim
10^{26}s. In particular, the DM very long lifetime is related to the tiny
neutrino masses, and the dominant DM decay channels to \mu and \tau are related
to the approximate \mu-\tau symmetry. Furthermore, the correct DM relic density
can be obtained via the freeze-in mechanism, the small-scale problem for power

Syst. 26(2), 125-146, 2011",,,"math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It has long been known that complex balanced mass-action systems exhibit a
restrictive form of behaviour known as locally stable dynamics. This means that
within each compatibility class $\mathcal{C}_{\mathbf{x}_0}$---the forward
invariant space where solutions lies---there is exactly one equilibrium
concentration and that this concentration is locally asymptotically stable. It
has also been conjectured that this stability extends globally to
$\mathcal{C}_{\mathbf{x}_0}$. That is to say, all solutions originating in
$\mathcal{C}_{\mathbf{x}_0}$ approach the unique positive equilibrium
concentration rather than $\partial \mathcal{C}_{\mathbf{x}_0}$ or $\infty$. To
date, however, no general proof of this conjecture has been found.
  In this paper, we approach the problem of global stability for complex
balanced systems through the methodology of dividing the positive orthant into
regions called strata. This methodology has been previously applied to detailed
balanced systems---a proper subset of complex balanced systems---to show that,
within a stratum, trajectories are repelled from any face of $\mathbb{R}_{\geq
0}^m$ adjacent to the stratum. Several known global stability results for
detailed balanced systems are generalized to complex balanced systems.

the limiting vectors of average displacements per time on trajectory segments.
The billard trajectories, being curves, oftentimes getting very close to closed
loops, quite naturally define elements of the fundamental group of the billiard
table. The simplest non-trivial fundamental group obtained this way belongs to
the classical Sinai billiard, i.e., the billiard flow on the 2-torus with a
single, convex obstacle removed. This fundamental group is known to be the
group $\textbf{F}_2$ freely generated by two elements, which is a heavily
noncommutative, hyperbolic group in Gromov's sense. We define the homotopical
rotation number and the homotopical rotation set for this model, and provide
lower and upper estimates for the latter one, along with checking the validity
of classically expected properties, like the density (in the homotopical
rotation set) of the homotopical rotation numbers of periodic orbits.
  The natural habitat for these objects is the infinite cone erected upon the
Cantor set $\text{Ends}(\textbf{F}_2)$ of all ""ends"" of the hyperbolic group
$\textbf{F}_2$. An element of $\text{Ends}(\textbf{F}_2)$ describes the
direction in (the Cayley graph of) the group $\textbf{F}_2$ in which the
considered trajectory escapes to infinity, whereas the height function $t$ ($t
\ge 0$) of the cone gives us the average speed at which this escape takes
place.
  The main results of this paper claim that the orbits can only escape to
infinity at a speed not exceeding $\sqrt{2}$, and any direction
$e\in\text{Ends}(F_2)$ for the escape is feasible with any prescribed speed
$s$, $0\leq s\leq \sqrt{2}/2$. This means that the radial upper and lower
bounds for the rotation set $R$ are actually pretty close to each other.

small spin gap \Delta ~ J_\perp \exp(-J_|| / J_\perp), and the bandwidth of the

developing new measure for object oriented system development is getting

software measure that is attracting the software developers, designers and
researchers. In this paper a new interactions are defined for object oriented
system. Using these interactions, a parser is developed to analyze the existing
architecture of the software. Within the design model, it is necessary for
design classes to collaborate with one another. However, collaboration should
be kept to an acceptable minimum i.e. better designing practice will introduce
low coupling. If a design model is highly coupled, the system is difficult to
implement, to test and to maintain overtime. In case of enhancing software, we
need to introduce or remove module and in that case coupling is the most
important factor to be considered because unnecessary coupling may make the
system unstable and may cause reduction in the system's performance. So
coupling is thought to be a desirable goal in software construction, leading to
better values for external software qualities such as maintainability,
reusability and so on. To test this hypothesis, a good measure of class
coupling is needed. In this paper, based on the developed tool called Design
Analyzer we propose a methodology to reuse an existing system with the
objective of enhancing an existing Object oriented system keeping the coupling

dimensional black objects with a cosmological constant. We present solitonic
braneworld models where the brane are inflating and with the presence of a

although slightly different exhibit common features which are pointed out. We
also consider $1+1$ dimensional toy models for coupling fermionic matter fields
to braneworld. In particular, we focus on a kink or kink/anti-kink solution of
the Sine-Gordon model, which can be seen as modeling a brane in the dimensions
transverse to our four dimensional spacetime. We also analyze the stability of
three particular models admitting kink or anti-kink like solutions and show
that the stability equations are Poschl-Teller equations. In the second part
after quickly reviewing available analytically known solutions, we present the
numerical construction of the higher dimensional charged rotating black hole
with a cosmological constant. Then, we present the black string solution and
review the stability problem of the latter before investigating the existence
of a de Sitter black string, which turns out not to be regular. Finally, we
present the AdS counterpart of the black string solution and study its
stability. Then, we construct numerically non uniform black strings, first in a
perturbative approach, then in the full non linear regime. Our result suggest
the existence of a thermodynamically stable phase of non uniform black string
and point to the presence of a phase of AdS localized black hole. Moreover, we
argue that the phase transition from uniform to non uniform black strings can
be of order larger than one in any number of dimensions, which is not the case

study the statistics of ensembles of hyperstatic frictionless force networks,
which are composed of more forces than can be determined uniquely from force
balance. Hyperstatic force networks possess degrees of freedom that rearrange
one balanced network into another. We construct these rearrangements, count
them, identify their elementary building blocks, and show that in two
dimensions they are related via duality to so-called floppy modes, which play
an important role in many other aspects of granular physics. We demonstrate
that the number of rearrangements governs the macroscopic statistical
properties of the ensemble, in particular the macroscopic fluctuations of
stress, which scale with distance to the isostatic point. We then show that a
maximum entropy postulate allows one to quantitatively capture many features of
the microscopic statistics. Boundaries are shown to influence the statistics
strongly: the probability distribution of large forces can have a qualitatively
different form on the boundary and in the bulk. Finally, we consider the role

presence of dynamical dark energy, and revisit the issue of dark energy
perturbations. For a generally parameterized equation of state (EoS) such as
w_D(z) = w_0+w_1\frac{z}{1+z}, (for a single fluid or a single scalar field )
the dark energy perturbation diverges when its EoS crosses the cosmological
constant boundary w_D=-1. In this paper we present a method of treating the
dark energy perturbations during the crossing of the $w_D=-1$ surface by
imposing matching conditions which require the induced 3-metric on the
hypersurface of w_D=-1 and its extrinsic curvature to be continuous. These
matching conditions have been used widely in the literature to study
perturbations in various models of early universe physics, such as Inflation,
the Pre-Big-Bang and Ekpyrotic scenarios, and bouncing cosmologies. In all of
these cases the EoS undergoes a sudden change. Through a detailed analysis of
the matching conditions, we show that \delta_D and \theta_D are continuous on
the matching hypersurface. This justifies the method used[1-4] in the numerical
calculation and data fitting for the determination of cosmological parameters.
We discuss the conditions under which our analysis is applicable.

in the afterglows of some gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Unlike X-ray flares, these
rebrightenings usually last for a relatively long period. The continuous energy
injection mechanism usually can only produce a plateau in the afterglow light
curve, but not a rebrightening. Also, a sudden energy injection can give birth
to a rebrightening, but the rebrightening is a bit too rapid. Here we argued
that the early rebrightenings can be produced by the ring-shaped jet model. In
this scenario, the GRB outflow is not a full cone, but a centrally hollowed
ring. Assuming that the line of sight is on the central symmetry axis of the
hollow cone, we calculate the overall dynamical evolution of the outflows and
educe the multiband afterglow light curves. It is found that the early
rebrightenings observed in the afterglows of a few GRBs, such as GRBs 051016B,
060109, 070103 and 070208 etc, can be well explained in this framework. It is
suggested that these long-lasted early rebrightenings in GRB afterglows should
be resulted from ring-shaped jets.

Destabilization of polaronic order in the ferromagnetic insulating state due to

monodisperse crystal. In bidisperse systems, a fraction f_+ = 40% up to 80% of
the total number of particles have their radii increased by \Delta R, while the
rest has their radii decreased by the same amount. Polydisperse packings are
prepared by changing all particle radii according to a uniform distribution in
the range [-\Delta R,\Delta R]. The results indicate that the critical packing
fraction is never larger than the value for the initial monodisperse crystal,
\phi = \pi/12, and that the lowest value achieved is approximately the one for
random close packing. These results are seen as a consequence of the interplay
between the increase in small-small particle contacts and the local crystalline
order provided by the large-large particle contacts.

the Fermi surface (FS) of the heavy quasiparticles changes from a hole-like
circle to four kidney-like pockets centered around $(\pi ,\pi)$. In-between
these two limiting cases, a first-order quantum phase transition is identified
at $J_{H}/J_{K}=0.1055$ where a small circle begins to emerge within the large

second-order quantum phase transition. As $J_{H}/J_{K}$ increases further, the
Fermi pockets are shifted along the direction ($\pi,\pi$) to ($\pi/2,\pi/2$),

motion, used particularly when long-range dependence is required. Its explicit
introduction is due to B.B. Mandelbrot and J.W. van Ness (1968) as a
self-similar Gaussian process $\WH (t)$ with stationary increments. Here
self-similarity means that $(a^{-H}\WH(at): t \ge 0) \stackrel{d}{=} (\WH(t): t
\ge 0)$, where $H\in (0, 1)$ is the Hurst parameter of fractional Brownian
motion.
  F.B. Knight gave a construction of ordinary Brownian motion as a limit of
simple random walks in 1961. Later his method was simplified by P. R\'ev\'esz
(1990) and then by the present author (1996). This approach is quite natural
and elementary, and as such, can be extended to more general situations. Based
on this, here we use moving averages of a suitable nested sequence of simple
random walks that almost surely uniformly converge to fractional Brownian
motion on compacts when $H \in (\quart , 1)$. The rate of convergence proved in
this case is $O(N^{-\min(H-\quart,\quart)}\log N)$, where $N$ is the number of
steps used for the approximation.
  If the more accurate (but also more intricate) Koml\'os, Major, Tusn\'ady
(1975, 1976) approximation is used instead to embed random walks into ordinary
Brownian motion, then the same type of moving averages almost surely uniformly
converge to fractional Brownian motion on compacts for any $H \in (0, 1)$.
Moreover, the convergence rate is conjectured to be the best possible
$O(N^{-H}\log N)$, though only $O(N^{-\min(H,\half)}\log N)$ is proved here.

a notion of solution to a class of nonlinear stochastic PDEs of Burgers type
that exhibit too high spatial roughness for classical analytical methods to
apply. In fact, the class of SPDEs that we consider is genuinely ill-posed in
the sense that different approximations to the nonlinearity may converge to
different limits. Using rough paths theory, a pathwise notion of solution to
these SPDEs is formulated, and we show that this yields a well-posed problem,
which is stable under a large class of perturbations, including the
approximation of the rough driving noise by a mollified version and the
addition of hyperviscosity.
  We also show that under certain structural assumptions on the coefficients,
the SPDEs under consideration generate a reversible Markov semigroup with

challenge was that `no amount of staring at the low dimensional cocycle

up this challenge, presenting a natural inductive construction of explicit
cubical cocyle conditions, and gives three ways in which the simplicial ones

rise to a Pascal's triangle of diagrams for cocycle conditions, has been

Yang-Baxter equation, the `pentagon of pentagons', and higher simplex
equations, are in essence different manifestations of the same underlying
abstract structure. There has been recent interest in higher-categories, by
computer scientists investigating concurrency theory, as well as by physicists,

stability of unprecedented precision (3mrad at K=5mag, which represents 3uas on
sky or a centroiding precision of 10^-3). The scientific potential of this mode
is demonstrated by the presented observations of the circumstellar disk of the
evolved Be-star 48Lib. In addition to indirect methods such as multi-wavelength
spectroscopy and polaritmetry, the here described spectro-interferometric
astrometry provides a new tool to directly constrain the radial density
structure in the disk. We resolve for the first time several Pfund emission
lines, in addition to BrGam, in a single interferometric spectrum, and with
adequate spatial and spectral resolution and precision to analyze the radial
disk structure in 48Lib. The data suggest that the continuum and Pf-emission
originates in significantly more compact regions, inside of the BrGam emission
zone. Thus, spectro-interferometric astrometry opens the opportunity to
directly connect the different observed line profiles of BrGam and Pfund in the
total and correlated flux to different disk radii. The gravitational potential
of a rotationally flattened Be star is expected to induce a one-armed density
perturbation in the circumstellar disk. Such a slowly rotating disk oscillation
has been used to explain the well known periodic V/R spectral profile
variability in these stars, as well as the observed V/R cycle phase shifts
between different disk emission lines. The differential line properties and
linear constraints set by our data lend support to the existence of a

which converges rapidly (with $n_\textrm{max}={\cal{O}}(30)$ terms). With an
effective grid resolution $l_\textrm{max}$ (number of particles/grid points
$N=l_\textrm{max}^3$), we present a bispectrum estimator which requires only
${\cal O}(n_\textrm{max} \times l_\textrm{max}^3)$ operations, along with a
corresponding method for direct bispectrum reconstruction. This method is
extended to the trispectrum revealing an estimator which requires only ${\cal
O}(n_\textrm{max}^{4/3} \times l_\textrm{max}^3)$ operations. The complexity in
calculating the trispectrum in this method is now involved in the original
decomposition and orthogonalisation process which need only be performed once
for each model. However, for non-diagonal trispectra these processes present
little extra difficulty and may be performed in ${\cal O}(l_\textrm{max}^4)$
operations. A discussion of how the methodology may be applied to the
quadspectrum is also given. An efficient algorithm for the generation of
arbitrary nonGaussian initial conditions for use in N-body codes using this
separable approach is described. This prescription allows for the production of
nonGaussian initial conditions for arbitrary bispectra and trispectra. A brief
outline of the key issues involved in parameter estimation, particularly in the
non-linear regime, is also given.

erupting flux rope in CME models. Observationally, white light observations
have recorded many occurrences of a thin ray appearing behind a CME eruption
that closely resembles a post-CME CS in its spatial correspondence and
morphology. UV and X-ray observations further strengthen this interpretation by
the observations of high temperature emission at locations consistent with
model predictions. The next question then becomes whether the properties inside
a post-CME CS predicted by a model agree with observed properties. In this
work, we assume that the post-CME CS is a consequence of Petschek-like
reconnection and that the observed ray-like structure is bounded by a pair of
slow mode shocks developed from the reconnection site. We perform
time-dependent ionization calculations and model the UV line emission. We find
that such a model is consistent with SOHO/UVCS observations of the post-CME CS.
The change of Fe XVIII emission in one event implies an inflow speed of ~10
km/s and a corresponding reconnection rate of M_A ~ 0.01. We calculate the
expected X-ray emission for comparison with X-ray observations by Hinode/XRT,
as well as the ionic charge states as would be measured in-situ at 1 AU. We
find that the predicted count rate for Hinode/XRT agree with what was observed
in a post-CME CS on April 9, 2008, and the predicted ionic charge states are
consistent with high ionization states commonly measured in the interplanetary
CMEs. The model results depend strongly on the physical parameters in the
ambient corona, namely the coronal magnetic field, the electron density and
temperature during the CME event. It is crucial to obtain these ambient coronal
parameters and as many facets of the CS properties as possible by observational
means so that the post-CME current sheet models can be scrutinized more
effectively.

  Local rings (R,m) with m^3=0 are commonly regarded as the structurally
simplest rings to admit diverse categorical and homological characteristics.
For such rings we obtain conclusive results about the category of totally

non-free cyclic totally reflexive module, we construct a family of
indecomposable totally reflexive R-modules that contains, for every n in N, a

well as a nominal cooling rate (in the absence of heating) of

can supply enough fuel to support the growth of the supermassive black hole and
to power the luminous quasar. The radiative power of the quasar exceeds by a
factor of 10 the kinematic power of the central radio source, suggesting that

a circular boundary. On the boundary the fermionic field obeys MIT bag boundary
condition. For irregular modes, a special case of boundary conditions at the
cone apex is considered, when the MIT bag boundary condition is imposed at a
finite radius, which is then taken to zero. We observe that the vacuum
expectation values for both charge density and azimuthal current are periodic
functions of the magnetic flux with the period equal to the flux quantum
whereas the expectation value of the radial component vanishes. For both
exterior and interior regions, the expectation values of the current are
decomposed into boundary-free and boundary-induced parts. For a massless field
the boundary-free part in the vacuum expectation value of the charge density
vanishes, whereas the presence of the boundary induces nonzero charge density.
Two integral representations are given for the boundary-free part in the case
of a massive fermionic field for arbitrary values of the opening angle of the
cone and magnetic flux. The behavior of the induced fermionic current is
investigated in various asymptotic regions of the parameters. At distances from
the boundary larger than the Compton wavelength of the fermion particle, the
