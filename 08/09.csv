validate each link of the projected network against a null hypothesis taking
into account the heterogeneity of the system. We apply our method to three
different systems, namely the set of clusters of orthologous genes (COG) in

our method is able to detect network structures which are informative about the

method (i) identifies the preferential relationships between the elements, (ii)
naturally highlights the clustered structure of investigated systems, and (iii)
allows to classify links according to the type of statistically validated

reduces the problem of verification of qualitative temporal properties on

two-step process comprising of digitization and canonical finitary reduction.
This technique enables us to verify safety invariants for real-time systems
using finite state model-checking avoiding the complexity of infinite state
(bounded) model checking and scale up models without applying techniques from
induction based proof methodology. Moreover, we can verify liveness properties
for real-time systems, which is not possible by using induction with infinite

collisions is the study of the jet quenching phenomenon whereby hard partons
lose their energy as they traverse the hot, dense matter created in such

nucleus-nucleus collisions as evidenced by the a large suppression of the yield
of high pT hadrons as compared to the expected yield based on measurements in
p+p collisions. Moreover, measurements of back-to-back correlations of charged
hadrons suggest that jet shapes are strongly modified modified by the medium.
The quantitative interpretation of single and di-hadron measurements is,
however, complicated by the fact that the initial parton energy is unknown. A
more informative measurement would be one in which the initial parton energy is
known, allowing the determination of the fragmentation function, which may be
effectively modified from its vacuum form by the presence of the medium. Two
measurements in which the initial parton energy may be estimated are discussed
in these proceedings: jet reconstruction and two- particle correlations using
direct photons. Jet reconstruction in nuclear collisions is challenging due to
the large background of soft particles, fluctuations of which give rise to fake
jets. Direct photons can be used to estimate the initial parton energy of the
recoil jet without recourse to jet reconstruction algorithms. However, such
studies suffer from a smaller rate and the direct photon signal must be
disentangled from a large background of decay photons. We present jet
reconstruction results which use an algorithm suitable for a high multiplicity
environment. We also present results of two-particle correlations using direct
photons. These results are discussed in the context of medium modification to
the fragmentation function.

In our approach we do not assume any specific form of a potential function for
the scalar field and we are looking for generic scenarios of evolution. We show
that dynamics of universe can be reduced to a 3-dimensional dynamical system.
We have found the set of fixed points and established their character. These
critical points represent all important epochs in evolution of the universe :
(a) a finite scale factor singularity, (b) an inflation (rapid-roll and
slow-roll), (c) a radiation domination, (d) a matter domination and (e) a
quintessence era. We have shown that the inflation, the radiation and matter
domination epochs are transient ones and last for a finite amount of time. The
existence of the radiation domination epoch is purely the effect of a
non-minimal coupling constant. We show the existence of a twister type solution
wandering between all these critical points.

domains on which f, Kf define respectively. Does this signal f vanish if
|{\Sigma}(f)|<|{\Omega}1|and|{\Sigma}(Kf)|<|{\Omega}2|? The excesses and
deficiencies of integral kernel K({\omega}, t) are found to be greatly related
to this general formulation of QUP. The complete point theory of integral
kernel is so established to deal with the QUP. This theory addresses the
density and linear independence of integral kernels. Some algebraic and
geometric properties of complete points are presented. It is shown that the
satisfaction of QUP depends on the existence of some complete points. By
recognizing complete points of their corresponding integral kernels, the QUP
with Fourier transform, Wigner-Ville distribution, Gabor transform and wavelet
are studied. It is shown the QUP only holds for good behaved integral
operators. An investigation of full violation of QUP shows that L2 space is
large for high resolution harmonic analysis. And the invertible linear integral
transforms whose kernels are complete in L2 probably lead to the satisfaction
of QUP. It indicates the performance limitation of linear integral transforms
in harmonic analysis. Two possible ways bypassing uncertainty principle,
nonlinear method and sparse representation, are thus suggested. The notion of
operator family is developed and is applied to understand remarkable
performances of recent sparse representation.

projectile release are propagated by flight dynamics. To address the question
of what governs the choice of throwing strategy, we use a simple model of
throwing with an arm modelled as a hinged bar of fixed length that can release
a projectile at any angle and angular velocity. We show that the amplification
of deviations in launch parameters from a one parameter family of solution
curves is quantified by the largest singular value of an appropriate Jacobian.
This allows us to predict a preferred throwing style in terms of this singular
value, which itself depends on target location and the target shape. Our
analysis also allows us to characterize the trade-off between speed and
accuracy despite not including any effects of signal-dependent noise. Using
nonlinear calculations for propagating finite input-noise, we find that an
underarm throw to a target leads to an undershoot, but an overarm throw does
not. Finally, we consider the limit of the arm-length vanishing, i.e. shooting
a projectile, and find that the most accurate shooting angle bifurcates as the
ratio of the relative noisiness of the initial conditions crosses a threshold.

matter by a factor of about 5 in the $\Lambda$CDM universe. Therefore, the
gravity on large scales should be dominant by the distribution of dark matter
in the universe. However, a series of observations incontrovertibly show that
the velocity and density fields of baryonic matter are decoupling from
underlying dark matter field. This paper shows our attemps to unveil the
physics behind this puzzle. In linear approximation, the dynamics of the baryon
fluid is completely governed by the gravity of the dark matter. Consequently,
the mass density field of baryon matter $\rho_b({\bf r},t)$ will be
proportional to that of dark matter $\rho_{\rm dm}({\bf r},t)$, even though
they are different from each other initially. In weak and moderate nonlinear
regime, the dynamics of the baryon fluid can be sketched by Burgers equation. A
basic feature of the Burgers dynamics is to yield shocks. When the Reynolds
number is large, the Burgers fluid will be in the state of Burgers turbulence,
which consists of shocks and complex structures. On the other hand, the
collisionless dark matter may not show such shock, but a multivalued velocity
field. Therefore, the weak and moderate nonlinear evolution leads to the
IGM-dark matter deviation. Yet, the velocity field of Burgers fluid is still
irrotational, as gravity is curl-free. In fully nonlinear regime, the vorticity
of velocity field developed, and the cosmic baryonic fluid will no longer be
potential, as the dynamics of vorticity is independent of gravity and can be
self maintained by the nonlinearity of hydrodynamics. In this case, the cosmic
baryon fluid is in the state of fully developed turbulence, which is
statistically and dynamically decoupling from dark matter. This scenario
provides a mechanism of cohenent explanation of observations.

propagation in a locally curved background, such as described by Fermi or
Riemann normal co-ordinates, this approach requires use of a constructed
operator to rotate the initial, intermediate, and final position ket vectors
onto their respective local tangent spaces, defined at each local time step
along some arbitrary classical reference worldline. Local time translation is
described using a quantum mechanical representation of Lie transport, that
while strictly non-unitary in operator form, nevertheless correctly recovers
the free-particle Lagrangian in curved space-time, along with new
contributions. This propagator yields the prediction that all probability
violating terms due to curvature contribute to a quantum violation of the weak
equivalence principle, while the remaining terms that conserve probability also
correspondingly satisfy the weak equivalence principle, at least to
leading-order in the particle's Compton wavelength. Furthermore, this
propagator possesses an overall curvature-dependent and gauge-invariant phase
factor that can be interpreted as the gravitational Aharonov-Bohm effect and

  Protocol on a MIMO Half-Duplex Relay Channel","37 pages and 7 figures",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The diversity-multiplexing tradeoff of the dynamic decode-and-forward
protocol is characterized for the half-duplex three-terminal (m,k,n)-relay
channel where the source, relay and the destination terminals have m, k and n
antennas, respectively. It is obtained as a solution to a simple, two-variable,
convex optimization problem and this problem is solved in closed form for
special classes of relay channels, namely, the (1,k,1) relay channel, the
(n,1,n) relay channel and the (2,k,2) relay channel. Moreover, the tradeoff
curves for a certain class of relay channels, such as the (m,k,n>k) channels,
are identical to those for the decode-and-forward protocol for the full duplex
channel while for other classes of channels they are marginally lower at high
multiplexing gains. Our results also show that for some classes of relay
channels and at low multiplexing gains the diversity orders of the dynamic
decode-and-forward protocol protocol are greater than those of the static
compress-and-forward protocol which in turn is known to be tradeoff optimal
over all {\em static} half duplex protocols. In general, the dynamic
decode-and-forward protocol has a performance that is comparable to that of the
static compress-and-forward protocol which, unlike the dynamic
decode-and-forward protocol, requires global channel state information at the
relay node. Its performance is also close to that of the decode-and-forward
protocol over the full-duplex relay channel thereby indicating that the
half-duplex constraint can be compensated for by the dynamic operation of the
relay wherein the relay switches from the receive to the transmit mode based on
the source-relay channel quality.

magnetograms derived using Hinode SOT/SP observations and study the
relationship between the vector magnetic field and power absorption and (ii)
study the variation of power absorption in sunspot penumbrae due to the
presence of spine-like radial structures. It is found that (i) both potential

center of the sunspot, and (ii) the magnitude of the transverse field, derived
from Hinode observations, is much larger than the potential transverse field
derived from SOHO/MDI longitudinal field observations. In the penumbra, the
radial structures called spines (intra-spines) have stronger (weaker) field
strength and are more vertical (horizontal). The absorption of acoustic power
in the spine and intra-spine shows different behaviour with the absorption

universal primitives of concurrent digital computation. The model has been used
both as a framework for a theoretical understanding of concurrency, and as the
theoretical basis for several practical implementations of concurrent systems.
Unlike previous models of computation, the Actor model was inspired by physical
laws. It was also influenced by the programming languages Lisp, Simula 67 and
Smalltalk-72, as well as ideas for Petri Nets, capability-based systems and
packet switching. The advent of massive concurrency through client-cloud
computing and many-core computer architectures has galvanized interest in the
Actor model.
  Actor technology will see significant application for integrating all kinds
of digital information for individuals, groups, and organizations so their
information usefully links together. Information integration needs to make use
of the following information system principles:
  * Persistence. Information is collected and indexed.
  * Concurrency: Work proceeds interactively and concurrently, overlapping in
time.
  * Quasi-commutativity: Information can be used regardless of whether it
initiates new work or become relevant to ongoing work.
  * Sponsorship: Sponsors provide resources for computation, i.e., processing,
storage, and communications.
  * Pluralism: Information is heterogeneous, overlapping and often
inconsistent.
  * Provenance: The provenance of information is carefully tracked and recorded
  The Actor Model is intended to provide a foundation for inconsistency robust
information integration

black hole-neutron star binary with a variety of equations of state (EOSs)
modeled by piecewise polytropes. We focus in particular on the dependence of
the gravitational waveform at the merger stage on the EOSs. The initial
conditions are computed in the moving-puncture framework, assuming that the
black hole is nonspinning and the neutron star has an irrotational velocity
field. For a small mass ratio of the binaries (e.g., MBH/MNS = 2 where MBH and
MNS are the masses of the black hole and neutron star, respectively), the
neutron star is tidally disrupted before it is swallowed by the black hole
irrespective of the EOS. Especially for less-compact neutron stars, the tidal
disruption occurs at a more distant orbit. The tidal disruption is reflected in
a cutoff frequency of the gravitational-wave spectrum, above which the spectrum
amplitude exponentially decreases. A clear relation is found between the cutoff
frequency of the gravitational-wave spectrum and the compactness of the neutron
star. This relation also depends weakly on the stiffness of the EOS in the core
region of the neutron star, suggesting that not only the compactness but also
the EOS at high density is reflected in gravitational waveforms. The mass of
the disk formed after the merger shows a similar correlation with the EOS,
whereas the spin of the remnant black hole depends primarily on the mass ratio
of the binary, and only weakly on the EOS. Properties of the remnant disks are
also analyzed.

that the electromagnetic response consists of two parts, the diamagnetic
current and the paramagnetic current, which exactly cancels the diamagnetic
term in the normal state, and then the Meissner effect is obtained for all the
temperature $T\leq T_{c}$ throughout the superconducting dome. By considering
the two-dimensional geometry of cuprate superconductors within the specular

entropies. Then we compare these with FPT distributions calculated from a

density-functional theory (DFT) for the ground-state energy and density of a
system of $N$ interacting electrons, albeit limited at the time by certain
troubling representability questions. As no practical exact form of the
exchange-correlation (xc) energy functional was known, the xc-functional had to
be approximated, ideally by a local or semilocal functional. Nowadays however
the realization that Nature is not always so nearsighted has driven us up
Perdew's Jacob's ladder to find increasingly nonlocal density/wavefunction
hybrid functionals. Time-dependent (TD-) DFT is a younger development which
allows DFT concepts to be used to describe the temporal evolution of the
density in the presence of a perturbing field. Linear response (LR) theory then
allows spectra and other information about excited states to be extracted from
TD-DFT. Once again the exact TD-DFT xc-functional must be approximated in
practical calculations and this has historically been done using the TD-DFT
adiabatic approximation (AA) which is to TD-DFT very much like what the local
density approximation (LDA) is to conventional ground-state DFT. While some of
the recent advances in TD-DFT focus on what can be done within the AA, others
explore ways around the AA. After giving an overview of DFT, TD-DFT, and
LR-TD-DFT, this article will focus on many-body corrections to LR-TD-DFT as one
way to building hybrid density-functional/wavefunction methodology for
incorporating aspects of nonlocality in time not present in the AA.

large softening of C66. So, we have checked our data through careful
measurements by using ultrasonic frequency higher than 60 MHz, so far. Then, it

have accumulated reliable data now. They will be reported in near future.

magnetometry measurements of exchange-bias characterizations including the EB
field, training effect, uncompensated spin density, and coercivity. Variations
of these parameters were found to be related to the surface oxidation of the
bottom electrode, among them the change of coercivity is most sensitive.

which strategies are not directly related to edge choices, but instead
correspond more generally to the exertion of social effort. The observed social
network is thus a byproduct of an expressive strategic interaction, which can
more naturally explain the emergence of complex social structures. Within this
framework, we present a natural network formation game in which agent utilities
are locally defined and that, despite its simplicity, produces a rich class of
equilibria that exhibit structural properties commonly observed in social
networks - such as triadic closure - that have proved elusive in most existing
models.
  Specifically, we consider a game in which players organize networking events
at a cost that grows with the number of attendees. An event's cost is assumed
by the organizer but the benefit accrues equally to all attendees: a link is
formed between any two players who see each other at more than a certain number
r of events per time period. The graph of connections so obtained is the social
network of the model.
  We analyze the Nash equilibria of this game when each player derives a
benefit a>0 from all her neighbors in the network and when the costs are
linear, i.e., when the cost of an event with L invitees is b+cL, with b>0 and
c>0. For a/cr > 1 and b sufficiently small, all Nash equilibria have the
complete graph as their social network; for a/cr < 1 the Nash equilibria
correspond to a rich class of social networks, all of which have substantial
clustering in the sense that the clustering coefficient is bounded below by the
inverse of the average degree. Additionally, for any degree sequence with
finite mean, and not too many vertices of degree one or two, we can construct a
Nash equilibrium producing a social network with the given degree sequence.

experimental and theoretical study of single unit cell superlattices of the
correlated metal LaNiO$_3$ and the band insulator LaAlO$_3$. Polarized x-ray
absorption spectra show a distinct asymmetry in the orbital response under
strain. A splitting of orbital energies consistent with octahedral distortions
is found for the case of compressive strain. In sharp contrast, for tensile
strain, no splitting is found although a strong orbital polarization is
present. Density functional theory calculations including a Hubbard U term
reveal that this asymmetry is a result of the interplay of strain and
confinement induces octahedral rotations and distortions and altered covalency
in the bonding across the interfacial Ni-O-Al apical oxygen, leading to a
charge disporportionation at the Ni sites for tensile strain.

Adams et al. (2007 Phys. Rev. Lett. 99 020601), we introduce a single slow site

time-correlation information of the particle occupancy of the system, we are
particularly interested in how the defect affects fluctuation in particle

Exploiting Monte Carlo simulations, we observe the disappearance of
oscillations when the defect is located at the center of the system. When the
defect is off center, oscillations are restored. To explore the origin of such
phenomenon, we use a linearized Langevin equation to calculate the power
spectrum for the sublattices and the whole lattice. We provide insights into
the interactions between the sublattices coupled through the defect site for
both simulation and analytical results.

generated from known potentials using a factorization that involves
superpotentials defined in terms of excited states of a potential. For these

defining such operators for its isospectral partners. The generality of the

increases the transverse HBT radii. The results of the longitudinal HBT radius
