of the sky-projected angle beta between the stellar rotation axis and a
planet's orbital axis. Using the HARPS spectrograph, we observed the
Rossiter-McLaughlin effect for six transiting hot Jupiters found by the WASP
consortium. We combine these with long term radial velocity measurements
obtained with CORALIE. We found that three of our targets have a projected
spin-orbit angle above 90 degrees: WASP-2b: beta = 153 (+11 -15), WASP-15b:
beta = 139.6 (+5.2 -4.3) and WASP-17b: beta = 148.5 (+5.1 -4.2); the other
three (WASP-4b, WASP-5b and WASP-18b) have angles compatible with 0 degrees.
There is no dependence between the misaligned angle and planet mass nor with
any other planetary parameter. All orbits are close to circular, with only one
firm detection of eccentricity on WASP-18b with e = 0.00848 (+0.00085
-0.00095). No long term radial acceleration was detected for any of the
targets. Combining all previous 20 measurements of beta and our six, we attempt
to statistically determine the distribution of the real spin-orbit angle psi
and find that between about 45 and 85 % of hot Jupiters have psi > 30 degrees.
Observations and predictions using the Kozai mechanism match well. If these
observational facts are confirmed in the future, we may then conclude that most
hot Jupiters are formed from a dynamical and tidal origin without the necessity
to use type I or II migration. At present, standard disc migration cannot
explain the observations without invoking at least another additional process.

Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS DR7). We statistically study the connection
between the internal colour variation and global galactic properties, looking
for hints of the recent galactic evolution. Considering only galaxies with good
photometry and spectral measurements, we define four luminosity-threshold
samples within the redshift range 0.01<z<0.17, each containing more than 48000
galaxies. Colour gradients are calculated for these galaxies from the surface
brightness measurements provided by the SDSS DR7. Possible systematic effects
in their determination have been analysed. We find that, on average, galaxies
have redder cores than their external parts. We also find that it is more
likely to find steep colour gradients among late-type galaxies. This result
holds for a range of classifications based on both morphological and spectral
characteristics. In fact, our results relate, on average, steep colour
gradients to a higher presence of young stars within a galaxy. Our results also
suggest that nuclear activity is a marginal driver for creating steep colour
gradients in massive galaxies. We have selected pairs of interacting galaxies,
with a separation of 5 arcsec, in projected radius, and a difference in
redshift of 100 km/s, finding that they present steeper gradients than the
average population, skewed towards bluer cores. Our analysis implies that
colour gradients can be useful for selecting galaxies that have suffered a
recent (minor) burst of star formation.

the well-behaved noise properties allow us to explore the stability of the

different than that for uniformly rotating stars, making the mode splitting a

its Levy measure is absolutely continuous, having completely monotone density.

signatures in these two remote-sensing techniques, the magnetohydrodynamics of
the macro-scale interplanetary disturbance and the radio-wave scattering of the
micro-scale electron-density fluctuation are coupled and investigated using a
newly-constructed multi-scale numerical model. This model is then applied to a
case of an interplanetary shock propagation within the ecliptic plane. The
shock could be nearly invisible to an HI, once entering the Thomson-scattering
sphere of the HI. The asymmetry in the optical images between the western and
eastern HIs suggests the shock propagation off the Sun-Earth line. Meanwhile,
an IPS signal, strongly dependent on the local electron density, is insensitive
to the density cavity far downstream of the shock front. When this cavity (or
the shock nose) is cut through by an IPS ray-path, a single speed component at
the flank (or the nose) of the shock can be recorded; when an IPS ray-path
penetrates the sheath between the shock nose and this cavity, two speed
components at the sheath and flank can be detected. Moreover, once a shock
front touches an IPS ray-path, the derived position and speed at the
irregularity source of this IPS signal, together with an assumption of a radial
and constant propagation of the shock, can be used to estimate the later
appearance of the shock front in the elongation of the HI field of view. The
results of synthetic measurements from forward modelling are helpful in
inferring the in-situ properties of coronal mass ejection from real

of manybody quantum systems. In this review, we focus on the electronic
structure QMC, i.e., methods relevant for systems described by the electron-ion
Hamiltonians. Some of the key QMC achievements include direct treatment of
electron correlation, accuracy in predicting energy differences and favorable
scaling in the system size. Calculations of atoms, molecules, clusters and
solids have demonstrated QMC applicability to real systems with hundreds of
electrons while providing 90-95% of the correlation energy and energy
differences typically within a few percent of experiments. Advances in accuracy
beyond these limits are hampered by the so-called fixed-node approximation
which is used to circumvent the notorious fermion sign problem. Many-body nodes
of fermion states and their properties have therefore become one of the
important topics for further progress in predictive power and efficiency of QMC
calculations. Some of our recent results on the wave function nodes and related
nodal domain topologies will be briefly reviewed. This includes analysis of
few-electron systems and descriptions of exact and approximate nodes using
transformations and projections of the highly-dimensional nodal hypersurfaces
into the 3D space. Studies of fermion nodes offer new insights into topological
properties of eigenstates such as explicit demonstrations that generic
fermionic ground states exhibit the minimal number of two nodal domains.
Recently proposed trial wave functions based on Pfaffians with pairing orbitals
are presented and their nodal properties are tested in calculations of first
row atoms and molecules. Finally, backflow ""dressed"" coordinates are introduced
as another possibility for capturing correlation effects and for decreasing the
fixed-node bias.

detectable by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). This possibility was
investigated extensively in a series of phenomenological papers during
1984-1985 in connection with the Superconducting Super Collider (SSC). The work
was mainly based on a model independent systematic parametrization of
scattering amplitudes and cross sections, for Standard Model particles, quarks
and leptons, that were assumed to behave like strings, while gluons, photons,
$W^{\pm},Z$ were taken as elementary. By using Veneziano type beta functions
consistent with crossing symmetry, duality and Regge behavior, bosonic or
fermionic resonances in each channel were included, while the low energy
behavior was matched to effective field theory non-renormalizable interactions
consistent with the Standard Model SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1) gauge symmetry as well as
global flavor and family symmetries. The motivation for this approach at that
time was the possible compositeness of quarks and leptons but the same
phenomenological approach would apply effectively with the modern additional
motivations for TeV scale strings, such as the hypothesis of D-branes with
large extra dimensions. Because some of the main theoretical and
phenomenological work of that time appeared only in the 1984 Snowmass and other
proceedings, the results of the investigations have been inaccessible to most
researchers and consequently have been largely forgotten. Meanwhile similar
approaches are being explored by other researchers. Given the renewed interest
in the old results, the purpose of the current paper is to make them readily
available.

This result can be attributed to the injection of energy and momentum by stars

stellar feedback is debated theoretically: possible sources of pressure include
the classical warm HII gas, the hot gas generated by shock-heating from stellar
winds and supernovae, direct radiation of stars, and the dust-processed
radiation field trapped inside the HII shell. In this paper, we measure
observationally the pressures associated with each component listed above
across the giant HII region 30 Doradus in the Large Magellanic Cloud. We
exploit high-resolution, multi-wavelengh images (radio, infrared, optical, and
X-ray) to map these pressures as a function of position. We find that radiation
pressure dominates within 75 pc of the central star cluster, R136, while the
HII gas pressure dominates at larger radii. By contrast, the dust-processed
radiation pressure and hot gas pressure are generally weak and not dynamically
important, although the hot gas pressure may have played a more significant
role at early times. Based on the low X-ray gas pressures, we demonstrate that
the hot gas is only partially confined and must be leaking out the HII shell.
Additionally, we consider the implications of a dominant radiation pressure on
the early dynamics of 30 Doradus.

least as well as zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming. All base stations share channel
state information, but each user's message is only routed to those that
participate in the user's coordination cluster. SIN precoding is particularly
useful when clusters of limited sizes overlap in the network, in which case
traditional techniques such as dirty paper coding or ZF do not directly apply.
The SIN precoder is computed by solving a sequence of convex optimization
problems. SIN under partial network coordination can outperform ZF under full
network coordination at moderate SNRs. Under overlapping coordination clusters,
SIN precoding achieves considerably higher throughput compared to myopic ZF,
especially when the clusters are large.

(hole)-phonon correlations via the deformation potential. We obtained the great

since they can factor integers and extract discrete logarithms. If we believe
that quantum computers will someday become a reality, we would like to have
\emph{post-quantum} cryptosystems which can be implemented today with classical
computers, but which will remain secure even in the presence of quantum
attacks.
  In this article we show that the McEliece cryptosystem over
\emph{well-permuted, well-scrambled} linear codes resists precisely the attacks
to which the RSA and El Gamal cryptosystems are vulnerable---namely, those
based on generating and measuring coset states. This eliminates the approach of
strong Fourier sampling on which almost all known exponential speedups by
quantum algorithms are based. Specifically, we show that the natural case of
the Hidden Subgroup Problem to which the McEliece cryptosystem reduces cannot
be solved by strong Fourier sampling, or by any measurement of a coset state.
We start with recent negative results on quantum algorithms for Graph
Isomorphism, which are based on particular subgroups of size two, and extend
them to subgroups of arbitrary structure, including the automorphism groups of
linear codes. This allows us to obtain the first rigorous results on the
security of the McEliece cryptosystem in the face of quantum adversaries,
strengthening its candidacy for post-quantum cryptography.

clusters of galaxies. Treating the distribution of gravitating matter as
piecewise constant and the cluster atmosphere as piecewise isothermal, X-ray
spectra of a hydrostatic atmosphere are determined up to a single overall
normalizing factor. In contrast to more conventional approaches, this method
relies on the minimum of assumptions, apart from the conditions of hydrostatic
equilibrium and spherical symmetry. The method has been implemented as an XSPEC
mixing model called CLMASS, which was used to determine masses for a sample of
nine relaxed X-ray clusters. Compared to conventional mass determinations,
CLMASS provides weak constraints on values of M_500, reflecting the quality of
current X-ray data for cluster regions beyond r_500. At smaller radii, where
there are high quality X-ray spectra inside and outside the radius of interest
to constrain the mass, CLMASS gives confidence ranges for M_2500 that are only
moderately less restrictive than those from more familiar mass determination
methods. The CLMASS model provides some advantages over other methods and
should prove useful for mass determinations in regions where there are high
quality X-ray data.

bulge-dominated, massive Sa galaxy, Sombrero (M104), based on new and archival
Chandra observations with a total exposure of ~200 ks. With a detection limit
of L_X = 1E37 erg/s and a field of view covering a galactocentric radius of ~30
kpc (11.5 arcminute), 383 sources are detected. Cross-correlation with Spitler
et al.'s catalogue of Sombrero globular clusters (GCs) identified from HST/ACS
observations reveals 41 X-rays sources in GCs, presumably low-mass X-ray
binaries (LMXBs). We quantify the differential luminosity functions (LFs) for
both the detected GC and field LMXBs, whose power-low indices (~1.1 for the
GC-LF and ~1.6 for field-LF) are consistent with previous studies for
elliptical galaxies. With precise sky positions of the GCs without a detected
X-ray source, we further quantify, through a fluctuation analysis, the GC LF at
fainter luminosities down to 1E35 erg/s. The derived index rules out a
faint-end slope flatter than 1.1 at a 2 sigma significance, contrary to recent
findings in several elliptical galaxies and the bulge of M31. On the other
hand, the 2-6 keV unresolved emission places a tight constraint on the field
LF, implying a flattened index of ~1.0 below 1E37 erg/s. We also detect 101
sources in the halo of Sombrero. The presence of these sources cannot be
interpreted as galactic LMXBs whose spatial distribution empirically follows
the starlight. Their number is also higher than the expected number of cosmic
AGNs (52+/-11 [1 sigma]) whose surface density is constrained by deep X-ray
surveys. We suggest that either the cosmic X-ray background is unusually high
in the direction of Sombrero, or a distinct population of X-ray sources is

different filtering methods: we evaluate our method beside the previously
explored Wiener filter approaches. Our method yields near-optimal angular
resolution of the lensing reconstruction and allows cluster sized halos to be
de-blended robustly. It allows for mass reconstructions which are 2-3
orders-of-magnitude faster than the Wiener filter approach; in particular, we
estimate that an all-sky reconstruction with arcminute resolution could be
performed on a time-scale of hours. We find however that linear, non-parametric
reconstructions have a fundamental limitation in the resolution achieved in the

Hulse and Taylor, there are currently 8 confirmed DNS in our galaxy. For every
system, the masses of both neutron stars, the orbital semi- major axis and
eccentricity are measured, and proper motion is known for half of the systems.
Using the orbital parameters and kinematic information, if available, as
constraints for all system, we investigate the immediate progenitor mass of the
second-born neutron star and the magnitude of the supernova kick it received at
birth, with the primary goal to understand the core collapse mechanism leading
to neutron star formation. Compared to earlier studies, we use a novel method
to address the uncertainty related to the unknown radial velocity of the
observed systems. For PSR B1534+12 and PSR B1913+16, the kick magnitudes are
150 - 270 km/s and 190 - 450 km/s (with 95% confidence) respectively, and the
progenitor masses of the 2nd born neutron stars are 1.3 - 3.4 Msun and 1.4 -
5.0 Msun (95%), respectively. These suggest that the 2nd born neutron star was
formed by an iron core collapse supernova in both systems. For PSR J0737-3039,
on the other hand, the kick magnitude is only 5 - 120 km/s (95%), and the
progenitor mass of the 2nd born neutron star is 1.3 - 1.9 Msun (95%). Because
of the relatively low progenitor mass and kick magnitude, the formation of the
2nd born neutron star in PSR J0737-3039 is potentially connected to an electron
capture supernova of a massive O - Ne - Mg white dwarf. For the remaining 5
Galactic DNS, the kick magnitude ranges from several tens to several hundreds
of km/s, and the progenitor mass of the 2nd formed neutron star can be as low
as ~1.5 Msun, or as high as ~8 Msun. Therefore in these systems, it is not
clear which type of supernova is more likely to form the 2nd neutron star.

account for FeII(4570)/FeII(UV) by a factor of 10, which may suggest anisotropy

techniques which work by comparing response signals of the scattering region,
by means of cross correlation and mutual information of signals. The
performance of the sensing techniques is compared for various perturbations
induced experimentally in an acoustic resonant cavity. The acoustic signals are
parametrically processed to mitigate the effect of dissipation and to vary the
spatial diversity of the sensing schemes. In addition to static boundary
condition perturbations at specified locations, perturbations to the medium of
wave propagation are shown to be detectable, opening up various real world
sensing applications in which a false negative cannot be tolerated.

photometrically-selected candidate cold disks (disks with large inner dust
holes). The infrared spectra are supplemented with optical spectra to determine
stellar and accretion properties and 1.3mm photometry to measure disk masses.
Based on detailed SED modeling, we identify 15 new cold disks. The remaining 20
objects have IRS spectra that are consistent with disks without holes, disks
that are observed close to edge-on, or stars with background emission. Based on
these results, we determine reliable criteria for identifying disks with inner
holes from Spitzer photometry and examine criteria already in the literature.
Applying these criteria to the c2d surveyed star-forming regions gives a
frequency of such objects of at least 4% and most likely of order 12% of the
YSO population identified by Spitzer.
  We also examine the properties of these new cold disks in combination with
cold disks from the literature. Hole sizes in this sample are generally smaller
than for previously discovered disks and reflect a distribution in better
agreement with exoplanet orbit radii. We find correlations between hole size
and both disk and stellar masses. Silicate features, including crystalline
features, are present in the overwhelming majority of the sample although 10
micron feature strength above the continuum declines for holes with radii
larger than ~7 AU. In contrast, PAHs are only detected in 2 out of 15 sources.
Only a quarter of the cold disk sample shows no signs of accretion, making it
unlikely that photoevaporation is the dominant hole forming process in most
cases.

new arena for exploring the nature of BEC, a long-term quest to confirm BEC of
excitons, quasi-Bose particles formed as a bound state of an electron-hole
pair, has been underway since its theoretical prediction in the 1960s.
Ensembles of electrons and holes are complex quantum systems with strong
Coulomb correlations; thus, it is non-trivial whether nature chooses a form of
exciton BEC. Various systems have been examined in bulk and two-dimensional
semiconductors and also exciton-photon hybrid systems. Among them, the 1s
paraexciton state in a single crystal of Cu2O has been a prime candidate for
realizing three-dimensional BEC. The large binding energy and long lifetime
enable preparation of cold excitons in thermal equilibrium with the lattice and
decoupled from the radiation field. However, collisional loss severely limits
the conditions for reaching BEC. Such a system with a large inelastic cross
section is excluded in atomic BEC experiments, where a small inelastic
scattering rate and efficient elastic scattering are necessary for evaporative
cooling. Here we demonstrate that it is nevertheless possible to achieve BEC by
cooling paraexcitons to sub-Kelvin temperatures in a cold phonon bath. Emission
spectra from paraexcitons in a three-dimensional trap show an anomalous
distribution in a threshold-like manner at the critical number of BEC expected
for ideal bosons. Bosonic stimulated scattering into the condensate and
collisional loss compete and limit the condensate to a fraction of about 1%.
This observation adds a new class of experimentally accessible BEC for
exploring a rich variety of matter phases of electron-hole ensembles.

investigate how peer effects operate in a real work setting. Workers were hired
from an online labor market to perform an image-labeling task and, in some
cases, to evaluate the work product of other workers. These evaluations had
financial consequences for both the evaluating worker and the evaluated worker.
The experiments showed that on average, evaluating high-output work raised an
evaluator's subsequent productivity, with larger effects for evaluators that
are themselves highly productive. The content of the subject evaluations
themselves suggest one mechanism for peer effects: workers readily punished
other workers whose work product exhibited low output/effort. However,
non-compliance with employer expectations did not, by itself, trigger
punishment: workers would not punish non-complying workers so long as the
evaluated worker still exhibited high effort. A worker's willingness to punish
was strongly correlated with their own productivity, yet this relationship was
not the result of innate differences---productivity-reducing manipulations also
resulted in reduced punishment. Peer effects proved hard to stamp out: although
most workers complied with clearly communicated maximum expectations for
output, some workers still raised their production beyond the output ceiling
after evaluating highly productive yet non-complying work products.

constructing a singular stationnary solution that will gain some regularity
when it serves as initial data in the heat equation. The Orlicz space appears
to be appropriate for this result since, in this case, the potential term is

techniques, namely k nearest neighbour classification, kernel density
estimation and a support vector machine (SVM). We discuss the performance of
the methods in terms of both completeness and contamination. We discuss the
prospect of trading off these values, achieving lower contamination at the
expense of lower completeness, by adjusting probability thresholds for the
classification. We also discuss the role of prior probabilities in the
classification performance, and we assess via simulations the reliability of
the dataset used for training. Overall it seems that no-prior gives the best
completeness, but adopting a prior lowers the contamination. We find that the
SVM generally delivers the lowest contamination for a given level of
completeness, and so is our method of choice. Finally, we classify a large
sample of SDSS DR7 photometry using the SVM trained on the spectroscopic
sample. We identify 27,074 probable BHB stars out of a sample of 294,652 stars.
We derive photometric parallaxes and demonstrate that our results are
reasonable by comparing to known distances for a selection of globular
clusters. We attach our classifications, including probabilities, as an
electronic table, so that they can be used either directly as a BHB star
catalogue, or as priors to a spectroscopic or other classification method. We

reconnection scales as the cube of an appropriately weighted magnetic field
strength divided by the square root of an appropriately weighted density. With
this functional dependence, the energy release in flares on the Sun, the large

classes of contact 3-manifolds which are symplectically cobordant to something
overtwisted, or to the tight 3-sphere, or which admit symplectic caps
containing symplectically embedded spheres with vanishing self-intersection.
These constructions imply new and simplified proofs of several recent results
involving fillability, planarity and non-separating contact type embeddings.
The cobordisms are built from generalized symplectic handles which have cores
that are arbitrary symplectic surfaces with boundary and co-cores that are
symplectic disks or annuli; these can be attached to contact 3-manifolds along
sufficiently large neighborhoods of transverse links or pre-Lagrangian tori. We
also sketch a construction of J-holomorphic foliations in these cobordisms and
formulate a conjecture regarding maps induced on Embedded Contact Homology with
twisted coefficients.

gauge group generators) is given which maintains compatibility with General
Relativity. It generates the dynamics for Electromagnetism and other Gauge
Fields along with Gravitation, at the time it gives a geometric foundation for
the stress-energy tensor of continuous matter. The geometric-invariance
principle under this integration is exposed and the resulting field equations
are obtained. The theory is developed over the tangent space of a
four-dimensional real manifold and the generators become those from the
Homogenous Lorentz group.
