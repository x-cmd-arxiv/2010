energy stored inside a nondispersive magnetic isotropic cylinder which is
obliquely irradiated by an electromagnetic plane wave. An expression for the
optical-absorption efficiency in terms of the magnetic internal coefficients is
also obtained. In the low absorption limit, we derive a relation between the
normalized internal energy and the optical-absorption efficiency which is not
affected by the magnetism and the incidence angle. This mentioned relation,
indeed, seems to be independent on the shape of the scatterer. This universal
aspect of the internal energy is connected to the transport velocity and
consequently to the diffusion coefficient in the multiple scattering regime.
Magnetism favors high internal energy for low size parameter cylinders, which
leads to a low diffusion coefficient for electromagnetic propagation in 2D
random media.

of the binding mechanism. The study presents a systematic large-scale analysis
of such conformational changes in the side chains. The results indicate that
short and long side chains have different propensities for the conformational
changes. Long side chains with three or more dihedral angles are often subject
to large conformational transition. Shorter residues with one or two dihedral
angles typically undergo local conformational changes not leading to a
conformational transition. The relationship between the local readjustments and
the equilibrium fluctuations of a side chain around its unbound conformation is
suggested. Most of the side chains undergo larger changes in the dihedral angle
most distant from the backbone. The amino acids with symmetric aromatic (Phe
and Tyr) and charged (Asp and Glu) groups show the opposite trend where the
near-backbone dihedral angles change the most. The frequencies of the
core-to-surface interface transitions of six nonpolar residues and Tyr exceed
the frequencies of the opposite, surface-to-core transitions. The binding
increases both polar and nonpolar interface areas. However, the increase of the
nonpolar area is larger for all considered classes of protein complexes. The
results suggest that the protein association perturbs the unbound interfaces to
increase the hydrophobic forces. The results facilitate better understanding of
the conformational changes in proteins and suggest directions for efficient
conformational sampling in docking protocols.

dwarf spheroidal galaxy. High quality, deep HST/ACS data, allowed us to obtain
the deepest color-magnitude diagram to date, reaching the old main sequence
turnoff (F814 ~ 29) with good photometric accuracy. Our analysis, based on
three different SFH codes, shows that Tucana is an old and metal-poor stellar
system, which experienced a strong initial burst of star formation at a very
early epoch (~ 13 Gyr ago) which lasted a maximum of 1 Gyr (sigma value). We
are not able to unambiguously answer the question of whether most star
formation in Tucana occurred before or after the end of the reionization era,
and we analyze alternative scenarios that may explain the transformation of
Tucana from a gas-rich galaxy into a dSph. Current measurements of its radial
velocity do not preclude that Tucana may have crossed the inner regions of the
Local Group once, and so gas stripping by ram pressure and tides due to a close
interaction cannot be ruled out. On the other hand, the high star formation
rate measured at early times may have injected enough energy into the
interstellar medium to blow out a significant fraction of the initial gas
content. Gas that is heated but not blown out would also be more easily
stripped via ram pressure. We compare the SFH inferred for Tucana with that of
Cetus, the other isolated LG dSph galaxy in the LCID sample. We show that the
formation time of the bulk of star formation in Cetus is clearly delayed with
respect to that of Tucana. This reinforces the conclusion of Monelli et al.
(2010) that Cetus formed the vast majority of its stars after the end of the
reionization era implying, therefore, that small dwarf galaxies are not
necessarily strongly affected by reionization, in agreement with many
state-of-the-art cosmological models. [abridged]

model pollen limitation through different relationships between mate
availability and fertilization success. After deriving a general stochastic
model, we focus on the simple case of distylous plant species where only two
classes of individuals exist. We first study the dynamics of such a species in
a large population limit and then, we look for an approximation of the
extinction probability in small populations. This leads us to consider
inhomogeneous random walks on the positive quadrant. We compare the dynamics of
distylous species to self-fertile species with and without inbreeding
depression, to obtain the conditions under which self-incompatible species
could be less sensitive to extinction while they can suffer more pollen

sinusoidal, primarily axial vibration conditions that can produce dramatic
disturbances at the gas-liquid free surface. Large-amplitude vibrations produce
liquid jets into the gas, droplets pinching off from the jets, gas cavities in
the liquid from droplet impact, and bubble transport below the interface, all
of which can be seen in the videos. Experiments were performed using several
different PDMS silicone oils covering a range of viscosity (1-50 cSt, i.e.,
1-50 times nominal water) and relatively low surface tension (e.g., 0.25 times

some classically impossible cryptographic primitives become possible when
quantum communication is allowed. One direct operational manifestation of these
uncertainty relations is a purely quantum effect referred to as information
locking. A locking scheme can be viewed as a cryptographic protocol in which a
uniformly random n-bit message is encoded in a quantum system using a classical
key of size much smaller than n. Without the key, no measurement of this
quantum state can extract more than a negligible amount of information about
the message, in which case the message is said to be ""locked"". Furthermore,
knowing the key, it is possible to recover, that is ""unlock"", the message. In
this paper, we make the following contributions by exploiting a connection
between uncertainty relations and low-distortion embeddings of L2 into L1. We
introduce the notion of metric uncertainty relations and connect it to
low-distortion embeddings of L2 into L1. A metric uncertainty relation also
implies an entropic uncertainty relation. We prove that random bases satisfy
uncertainty relations with a stronger definition and better parameters than
previously known. Our proof is also considerably simpler than earlier proofs.
We apply this result to show the existence of locking schemes with key size
independent of the message length. We give efficient constructions of metric
uncertainty relations. The bases defining these metric uncertainty relations
are computable by quantum circuits of almost linear size. This leads to the
first explicit construction of a strong information locking scheme. Moreover,
we present a locking scheme that is close to being implementable with current
technology. We apply our metric uncertainty relations to exhibit communication
protocols that perform quantum equality testing.

the description of differential invariants of the selected subalgebra. Given no

Within this framework, the algebraic method or direct integration of

the dust emission peaks at an orbital radius of about 100 AU, while the CO

the observation with theoretical disk models, we derive that the disk surface
density Sigma(r) steeply increases from 40 to 100 AU, and decreases
exponentially outward. Within 40 AU, the disk has to be optically thin in the
continuum emission at millimeter wavelengths to explain the observed dust
morphology, though our observations lack the angular resolution and sensitivity
required to constrain the surface density on these spatial scales. The surface
density distribution in MWC 758 disk is similar to that of ``transition''
disks, though no disk clearing has been previously inferred from the analysis
of the spectral energy distribution (SED). Moreover, the asymmetries observed
in the dust and CO emission suggest that the disk may be gravitationally
perturbed by a low mass companion orbiting within a radius of 30 AU. Our
results emphasize that SEDs alone do not provide a complete picture of disk
structure and that high resolution millimeter-wave images are essential to

scattered light of the central source to emission from clustered sources, while
the outer scale marks the spatial extent of scattered emission from these
clustered sources. Both scales tend to increase with halo mass, UV luminosity,

Methods. For this purpose, we present a grid of photoionization models that
covers metallicities from Z = 0.001 to Z = 0.040, ages from 0.1 to 10 Ma (with
a time step of 0.1 Ma), and cluster initial masses from 1 to 107 Mo. The
stellar masses follow a Salpeter initial mass function (IMF) in an
instantaneous burst mode of star formation. We obtain power-law scale-relations
between emission-line luminosities and ionizing cluster masses from the grids
and we evaluate the dependences on the ionizing cluster mass for some line
luminosities, equivalent widths and line ratios. Results. Power-law
scale-relations are shown to be useful tools to obtain robust diagnostics, as
examples: (a) H?/H? ratio varies from the usually assumed value of 2.86, these
variations imply the existence of a lower limit to the attainable precision in
extinction estimations of ?E(B - V) ~ 0.1.; (b) EW(H?) is a good age indicator
with a small dependence on cluster mass, while EW([O iii] 5007) shows a
noteworthy mass dependence; (c) abundance estimations from R23 are practically
unaffected by variations of the cluster mass; (d) estimations from S 23 and ?'
would improve if the cluster mass dependences were considered and (e) [Oii]
3727/H? is a good star formation rate indicator for ages older than -4.5 Ma. We
also show that the ionizing cluster mass dependence explains why empirical
calibrations produce more reliable diagnostics of some emission lines than
photoionization models grids. Finally, we show preliminary results about the
contribution of low mass clusters (M < 104 Mo) to the integrated emission line
spectra of galaxies, which can be as high as 80% for some relevant lines.

two-field model to an effectively single-field description. However, the strong
coupling sets a new scale in the system, and affects the evolution of the
perturbations as well as the beginning of the regime of validity of the
effective field theory. In particular, the predictions of the model are
sensitive to the relative hierarchy between the coupling and the mass of the
heavy mode. As a result, observables are not given unambiguously in terms of
the parameters of an effectively single field model with non-trivial sound
speed. Finally, the requirement that the sound horizon crossing occurs within
the regime of validity of the effective theory leads to a lower bound on the

been confirmed in the twice as distant Hydra I and Centaurus clusters. Having
(nearly) complete samples of UCDs in some of these clusters allows the study of
the bulk properties with respect to the environment they are living in.
Moreover, the relation of UCDs to other stellar systems in galaxy clusters,
like globular clusters and dwarf ellipticals, can be investigated in detail
with the present data sets. The general finding is that UCDs seem to be a
heterogenous class of objects. Their spatial distribution within the clusters
is in between those of globular clusters and dwarf ellipticals. In the
colour-magnitude diagram, blue/metal-poor UCDs coincide with the sequence of
nuclear star clusters, whereas red/metal-rich UCDs reach to higher masses and
might have originated from the amalgamation of massive star cluster complexes
in merger or starburst galaxies.

starburst galaxies is a long-standing problem. We suggest that synchrotron
emission of 10 - 100 TeV electrons and positrons (e+/-) can contribute to this
emission, because starbursts have strong magnetic fields. We consider three
sources of e+/- at these energies: (1) primary electrons directly accelerated
by supernova remnants; (2) pionic secondary e+/- created by inelastic
collisions between CR protons and gas nuclei in the dense ISMs of starbursts;
(3) pair e+/- produced between the interactions between 10 - 100 TeV gamma-rays
and the intense far-infrared (FIR) radiation fields of starbursts. We create
one-zone steady-state models of the CR population in the Galactic Center (R <=
112 pc), NGC 253, M82, and Arp 220's nuclei, assuming a power law injection
spectrum for electrons and protons. We compare these models to extant radio and
GeV and TeV gamma-ray data for these starbursts, and calculate the diffuse
synchrotron X-ray and Inverse Compton (IC) luminosities of these starbursts. If
the primary electron spectrum extends to ~PeV energies and has a
proton/electron injection ratio similar to the Galactic value, we find that
synchrotron contributes 2 - 20% of their unresolved, diffuse hard X-ray
emission. Inverse Compton emission is likewise a minority of the unresolved
X-ray emission in these starbursts, from 0.1% in the Galactic Center to 10% in
Arp 220's nuclei. We also model generic starbursts, including submillimeter
galaxies, in the context of the FIR--X-ray relation, finding that up to 2% in
the densest starbursts with our fiducial assumptions. Neutrino and TeV
gamma-ray data can further constrain the synchrotron X-ray emission of
starbursts. Our models do not constrain hard synchrotron X-ray emission from
any additional hard components of primary e+/- from sources like pulsars in
starbursts.

spectra of low mass stellar clusters. Methods. We performed 2 x 10^6 Monte
Carlo simulations of zero-age solar-metallicity stellar clusters covering the
20 - 10^6 Mo mass range. We study the distribution of cluster stellar masses,
Mclus, ionizing fluxes, Q(H0), and effective temperatures, Tclus. We compute
photoionization models that broadly describe the results of the simulations and
compare them with photoionization grids. Results. Our main results are: (a) A
large number of low mass clusters (80% for Mclus = 100 Mo) are unable to form
an H ii region. (b) There are a few overluminous stellar clusters that form H
ii regions. These overluminous clusters preserve statistically the mean value
of <Q(H0)> obtained by synthesis models, but the mean value cannot be used as a
description of particular clusters. (c) The ionizing continuum of clusters with
Mclus < 10^4 Mo is more accurately described by an individual star with
self-consistent effective temperature(T*) and Q(H0) than by the ensemble of
stars (or a cluster Tclus) produced by synthesis models. (d)Photoionization
grids of stellar clusters can not be used to derive the global properties of
low mass clusters. Conclusions. Although variations in the upper mass limit,
mup, of the IMF would reproduce the effects of IMF sampling, we find that an ad
hoc law that relates mup to Mclus in the modelling of stellar clusters is
useless, since: (a) it does not cover the whole range of possible cases, and
(b) the modelling of stellar clusters with an IMF is motivated by the need to
derive the global properties of the cluster: however, in clusters affected by
sampling effects we have no access to global information of the cluster but
only particular information about a few individual stars.

that the growth of density fluctuations is scale-dependent even in the linear
regime in some modified gravity theories, which opens a new possibility of
testing the theories observationally. We propose to use the genus of the
iso-density contours, an intrinsic measure of the topology of large scale
structure, as a statistic to be used in such tests. In Einstein's general
theory of relativity, density fluctuations are growing at the same rate on all
scales in the linear regime, and the genus per comoving volume is almost
conserved as structures are growing homologously, so we expect that the
genus-smoothing scale relation is basically time-independent. However, in some
modified gravity models where structures grow with different rates on different
scales, the genus-smoothing scale relation should change over time. This can be
used to test the gravity models with large scale structure observations. We
studied the case of the f(R) theory, DGP braneworld theory as well as the
parameterized post-Friedmann (PPF) models. We also forecast how the modified

in complex chemical systems as variational principle in formalism of recently
developed discrete thermodynamics (DTD) of chemical equilibria. In classical
approach the problem of complex equilibrium is solved by minimization of the
system Gibbs' free energy subject to logistic constraints. DTD demands any
isolated system to comprise smaller subentities, which individual equilibria
are based on the balance of internal and external thermodynamic forces, acting
against them. The internal forces are equal to the subsystems thermodynamic
affinities, while external forces originate from subsystems mutual
interactions. Those interactions impose additional constraints on the mother
system Gibbs' free energy minimum. Basic expression of discrete thermodynamics,
being multiplied by subsystems deviations from their ""true"" thermodynamic
equilibria, is naturally identical to d'Alembert's principle. A thermodynamic
version of d'Alembert's principle in combination with derived from it
thermodynamic version of the principle of virtual work, allowed us to express
the interactive constraints as a condition, that the sum of all subsystems
thermodynamic affinities, multiplied by their deviations from their ""true""
equilibria, must be equal to zero. The revised formula of global equilibrium
condition in complex chemical systems contains three terms - system Gibbs' free
energy, logistic constraints, identical to their classical version, and
interactive constraints, originated from the subsystems mutual interactions.

in low applied magnetic fields (H < 100 Oe) in a single crystal of
Ca(3)Rh(4)Sn(13) near its superconducting transition temperature (T(c) approx
8.35 K). For 30 Oe < H < 100 Oe, the PMFC response crosses over to a
diamagnetic response as the temperature is lowered below 8 K. For 100 Oe < H <
300 Oe, the diamagnetic response undergoes an unexpected reversal in its field
dependence above a characteristic temperature (designated as T*(VL) = 7.9 K),
where the field-cooled cool-down magnetization curves intersect. The in-phase
and out-of-phase ac susceptibility data confirm the change in the
superconducting state across T*(VL). We ascribe the PMFC response to a
compression of magnetic flux caused by the nucleation of superconductivity at
the surface of the sample. In very low fields (H < 20 Oe), the PMFC response
has an interesting oscillatory behaviour which persists up to about 7 K. The
oscillatory nature underlines the interplay between competing responses
contributing to the magnetization signal in PMFC regime. We believe that the
(i) counterintuitive field dependence of the diamagnetic response for H > 100
Oe and above T*(VL) (lasting up to T(c), (ii) the oscillatory character in PMFC
response at low fields and (iii) the PMFC peaks near 8.2 K in 30 Oe <= H <= 100
Oe provide support in favour of a theoretical scenario based on the
Ginzburg-Landau equations. The scenario predicts the possibility of complex
magnetic fluctuations associated with transformation between different
metastable giant vortex states prior to transforming into the conventional
vortex state as the sample is cooled below T*(VL).

high-resolution monitoring campaigns had not previously targetted outbursts in
which the compact object was either a neutron star or a white dwarf. To address
this issue, we have embarked on the Jet Acceleration and Collimation Probe Of
Transient X-Ray Binaries (JACPOT XRB) project, which aims to use high angular
resolution observations to compare disk-jet coupling across the stellar mass
scale, with the goal of probing the importance of the depth of the
gravitational potential well, the stellar surface and the stellar magnetic
field, on jet formation. Our team has recently concluded its first monitoring
series, including (E)VLA, VLBA, X-ray, optical, and near-infrared observations
of entire outbursts of the black hole candidate H1743-322, the neutron star
system Aquila X-1, and the white dwarf system SS Cyg. Here we present
preliminary results from this work, largely confirming the current paradigm,
but highlighting some intriguing new behavior, and suggesting a possible
difference in the jet formation process between neutron star and black hole
systems.

the droplet deforms differently depending on the non-dimensional rotation rate,

biconvex, convex-concave and biconcave. While the biconvex and convex-concave
families are due to the compression by the combined vortex ring (the lee side
of the interface). The biconcave family is formed because of the huge surface
tension at the droplet edge that restrains further deformation there. In a
special case, the biconcave family releases the combined vortex ring from the
droplet. The release of the vortex ring is observed to be at $Re$ one order of

unknown even in the most well studied species (e.g. fruit fly). Here, in the
fluid dynamics video, we demonstrate in-vivo imaging and microsurgery to
elucidate the design principles of feeding structures of the common house fly.
Using high-resolution X-ray absorption microscopy, we record in-vivo flow of
sucrose solutions through the body over many hours during fly feeding.
Borrowing from microsurgery techniques common in neurophysiology, we are able
to perturb the pump to a stall position and thus evaluate function under load
conditions. Furthermore, fluid viscosity-dependent feedback is observed for
optimal pump performance. As the gut of the fly starts to fill up, feedback
from the stretch receptors in the cuticle dictates the effective flow rate.
Finally, via comparative analysis between the housefly, blow fly, fruit fly and
bumble bees, we highlight the common design principles and the role of
interfacial phenomena in feeding.

develop EC2, a novel, greedy active learning algorithm and prove that it is

guarantees for Bayesian active learning with noisy observations. Our bounds
rely on a recently discovered diminishing returns property called adaptive
submodularity, generalizing the classical notion of submodular set functions to
adaptive policies. Our results hold even if the tests have non-uniform cost and
their noise is correlated. We also propose EffECXtive, a particularly fast
approximation of EC2, and evaluate it on a Bayesian experimental design problem
involving human subjects, intended to tease apart competing economic theories

the motion of a dielectric object inside a high finesse optical cavity. In
particular, we derive the total Hamiltonian of the system as well as a master
equation describing the state of the center of mass mode of the dielectric and
the cavity field mode. In addition, a quantum theory of elasticity is used in
order to study the coupling of the center of mass motion with internal
vibrational excitations of the dielectric. This general theory is applied to
the recent proposal of using an optically levitating nanodielectric as a cavity
optomechanical system [Romero-Isart et al. NJP 12, 033015 (2010), Chang et al.

quantum superpositions of Fock states. Finally, we introduce a direct
mechanical tomography scheme to probe these genuine quantum states by time of

The focus of these Monte Carlo simulations is to study the competing effects of
the homeotropic anchoring due to the surface inducing orientational ordering in
the radial direction and the inherent uniaxial order promoted by the
intermolecular interactions. By adopting entropic sampling procedure, we could
investigate this transition with a high temperature precision, and we studied
the effect of the surface anchoring strength on the phase diagram for a
specifically chosen geometry. We find that there is a threshold anchoring
strength of the surface below which uniaxial nematic phase results, and above
which the isotropic fluid cools to a radially ordered nematic phase, besides of
course expected changes in the phase transition temperature with the anchoring
strength. In the vicinity of the threshold anchoring strength we observe a
bistable region between these two structures, clearly brought out by the
characteristics of the corresponding microstates constituting the entropic

plasma by the classical as well as the spin-induced ponderomotive force (CPF

dynamics of the whistlers and the wakefields is shown to be governed by a
coupled set of nonlinear Schr\""{o}dinger (NLS) and driven Boussinesq-like
equations. It is found that the quantum force associated with the Bohm
potential introduces two characteristic length scales, which lead to the
excitation of multiple wakefields in a strongly magnetized dense plasma (with a
typical magnetic field strength $B_{0}\gtrsim10^{9}$ T and particle density
$n_{0}\gtrsim10^{36}$ m$^{-3}$), where the SPF strongly dominates over the CPF.
In other regimes, namely $B_{0}\lesssim10^{8}$ T and $\ n_{0}\lesssim10^{35}$
m$^{-3}$, where the SPF is comparable to the CPF, a plasma wakefield can also
be excited self-consistently with one characteristic length scale. Numerical
results reveal that the wakefield amplitude is enhanced by the quantum
tunneling effect, however it is lowered by the external magnetic field. Under
appropriate conditions, the wakefields can maintain high coherence over
multiple plasma wavelengths and thereby accelerate electrons to extremely high
energies. The results could be useful for particle acceleration at short
scales, i.e. at nano- and micrometer scales, in magnetized dense plasmas where
the driver is the whistler wave instead of a laser or a particle beam.

confined in a Cd$_{0.997}$Mn$_{0.003}$Te quantum well structure under
conditions of vanishing Zeeman energy. The electron Zeeman energy has been
tuned via the $s-d$ exchange interaction in order to probe different quantum
Hall states associated with metallic and insulating phases. We have observed
that reducing Zeeman energy to zero does not necessary imply the disappearing
of quantum Hall states, i.e. a closing of the spin gap. The spin gap value
under vanishing Zeeman energy conditions is shown to be dependent on the
filling factor. Numerical simulations support a qualitative description of the
experimental data presented in terms of a crossing or an avoided-crossing of
spin split Landau levels with same orbital quantum number $N$.

the Spitzer telescope as part of the ``Surveying the Agents of a Galaxy's

extinction (Av) maps of the LMC. A total of 272 molecular clouds have been
detected in the LMC in a previous molecular survey, accounting for 230 giant
molecular clouds and 42 smaller clouds. We perform correlations between the IR
emission/extinction, and atomic and molecular gas tracers. We compare the
atomic gas that surrounds the molecular cloud with the molecular gas in the
cloud. Using a dust emission model, we derive the physical properties of dust
in and outside the clouds: equilibrium temperature, emissivity and extinction.
We also determine the luminosity of the interstellar radiation field
intercepted by the cloud, and the total IR luminosity. Statistically, we do not
find any significant difference in the dust properties between the atomic and
the molecular phases. In particular we do not find evidence for a systematic
decrease of the dust temperature in the molecular phase, with respect to the
surrounding, presumably atomic gas. This is probably because giant molecular
clouds are the sites of star formation, which heat the dust, while the smallest
clouds are unresolved. The ratio between the IR luminosity and the cloud mass
(LDust/Mgas) does not seem to correlate with Mgas. The highest value of the
ratio we derived is 18.1 Lsol/Msol in the 30 Doradus region, which is known to
be the most prominent star formation region of the LMC, while the most likely
value is 0.5 and is representative of quiescent clouds. We provide a
prescription to associate the various stages of star formation with its
LDust/Mgas.

of Slepian-Wolf Coding (SWC), especially for short data blocks. To study the
property of DAC codewords, the author has proposed the concept of DAC codeword
spectrum. For equiprobable binary sources, the problem was formatted as solving
a system of functional equations. Then, to calculate DAC codeword spectrum in
general cases, three approximation methods have been proposed. In this paper,
the author makes use of DAC codeword spectrum as a tool to answer an important
question: how many (including proper and wrong) paths will be created during
the DAC decoding, if no path is pruned? The author introduces the concept of
another kind of DAC codeword spectrum, i.e. time spectrum, while the
originally-proposed DAC codeword spectrum is called path spectrum from now on.
To measure how fast the number of decoding paths increases, the author
introduces the concept of expansion factor which is defined as the ratio of
path numbers between two consecutive decoding stages. The author reveals the
relation between expansion factor and path/time spectrum, and proves that the
number of decoding paths of any DAC codeword increases exponentially as the
decoding proceeds. Specifically, when symbols `0' and `1' are mapped onto
intervals [0, q) and [(1-q), 1), where 0.5<q<1, the author proves that
expansion factor converges to 2q as the decoding proceeds.

Asteroseismology is an effcient tool not only for testing stellar
structure and evolutionary theory but also constraining the parameters of stars
for which solar-like oscillations are detected, presently. As an important
southern asteroseismic target, Tau Ceti, is a metal-poor star. The main
features of the oscillations and some frequencies of ? Ceti have been
identified. Many scientists propose to comprehensively observe this star as
part of the Stellar Observations Network Group. Aims. Our goal is to obtain the
optimal model and reliable fundamental parameters for the metal-poor star Tau
Ceti by combining all non-asteroseismic observations with these seismological
data. Methods. Using the Yale stellar evolution code (YREC), a grid of stellar
model candidates that fall within all the error boxes in the HR diagram have
been constructed, and both the model frequencies and large- and small-
frequency separations are calculated using the Guenther's stellar pulsation
code. The \chi2c minimization is performed to identify the optimal modelling
parameters that reproduce the observations within their errors. The frequency
corrections of near-surface effects to the calculated frequencies using the
empirical law, as proposed by Kjeldsen and coworkers, are applied to the
models. Results. We derive optimal models, corresponding to masses of about
0.775 - 0.785 M? and ages of about 8 - 10 Gyr. Furthermore, we find that the
quantities derived from the non-asteroseismic observations (effective
temperature and luminosity) acquired spectroscopically are more accurate than
those inferred from interferometry for ? Ceti, because our optimal models are
in the error boxes B and C, which are derived from spectroscopy results.

pseudo-spin of two atomic ensembles) and the possibility to perform passive
optical operations (typically beam-splitters) on the optical modes before or
after the storage, two possible scenarios arise resulting in generally
different degrees of final entanglement. Namely, one could either store an
entangled state and retrieve it directly from the memory, or rather store two
separate single-mode squeezed states and then combine them with a beam-splitter
to generate the final entangled state. In this paper, we address the question
of which of these two options yields the higher entanglement. By adopting a
well established descrip- tion of QND feedback memories, and a simple but
realistic noise model, we analytically determine the optimal choice for several
regions of noise parameters and quantify the advantage it entails, not only in
terms of final entanglement but also in terms of the capability of the final
state to act as a shared resource for quantum teleportation. We will see that,
for 'ideal' or 'nearly ideal' memories, the more efficient of the two options
is the one that better protects the quadrature subject to the largest noise in
the memory (by increasing it and making it more robust).

energy loss in the QGP via gluon radiation and elastic collisions along their

the energy loss on the jet structure and energy profile. A data-driven

Electromagnetic Calorimeter allows measurements of fully reconstructed di-jets,
defined by jets that match the online trigger and recoil jets on the away side.
A tight selection of the trigger jets allows for a selection of those coming
from the surface. Hence, the population of jets on the recoil side is biased
towards a maximal energy loss because of the extreme in-medium pathlength. We
present measurements of di-jets, exploring their structure and properties in

condenses onto the domain walls, providing a resistive force to the otherwise

entropy to Kolmogorov complexity. Two of the main applications of Kolmogorov
complexity are presented: randomness and classification. The survey is divided
in two parts in the same volume. Part I is dedicated to information theory and
the mathematical formalization of randomness based on Kolmogorov complexity.
This last application goes back to the 60's and 70's with the work of
Martin-L\""of, Schnorr, Chaitin, Levin, and has gained new impetus in the last
years.

\mathcal{P},p|n}(1+1/p)$ be the Dedekind psi function. We show that the Riemann
hypothesis is satisfied if and only if $f(n)=\psi(n)/n-e^{\gamma} \log \log n
<0$ for all integers $n>n_0=30$ (D), where $\gamma \approx 0.577$ is Euler's
constant. This inequality is equivalent to Robin's inequality that is recovered
from (D) by replacing $\psi(n)$ with the sum of divisor function $\sigma(n)\ge
\psi(n)$ and the lower bound by $n_0=5040$. For a square free number, both
arithmetical functions $\sigma$ and $\psi$ are the same. We also prove that any
exception to (D) may only occur at a positive integer $n$ satisfying
$\psi(m)/m<\psi(n)/n$, for any $m

  computing service","22 pages",,,,"cs.DC math.PR math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cloud-computing shares a common pool of resources across customers at a scale
that is orders of magnitude larger than traditional multi-user systems.
Constituent physical compute servers are allocated multiple ""virtual machines""
(VM) to serve simultaneously. Each VM user should ideally be unaffected by
others' demand. Naturally, this environment produces new challenges for the
service providers in meeting customer expectations while extracting an
efficient utilization from server resources. We study a new cloud service
metric that measures prolonged latency or delay suffered by customers. We model
the workload process of a cloud server and analyze the process as the customer
population grows. The capacity required to ensure that average workload does
not exceed a threshold over long segments is characterized. This can be used by
cloud operators to provide service guarantees on avoiding long durations of
latency. As part of the analysis, we provide a uniform large-deviation
principle for collections of random variables that is of independent interest.

  Analytical Mechanics","26 pages",,,,"physics.gen-ph math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There are two very important subjects in physics: Symmetry of dynamical
models and nonlinearity. All really fundamental models are invariant under some
particular symmetry groups. There is also no true physics, no our Universe and
life at all, without nonlinearity. Particularly interesting are essential,
non-perturbative nonlinearities which are not described by correction terms
imposed on some well-defined linear background. Our idea in this paper is that
there exists some mysterious, not yet understood link between essential,
physically relevant nonlinearity and dynamical symmetry, first of all, large
symmetry groups. In some sense the problem is known even in soliton theory,
where the essential nonlinearity is often accompanied by the infinite system of
integrals of motion, thus, by infinite-dimensional symmetry groups. Here we
discuss some more familiar problems from the realm of field theory, condensed
matter physics, and analytical mechanics, where the link between essential
nonlinearity and high symmetry is obvious, even if not yet fully understood.
