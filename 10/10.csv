of matter distribution has been considered. It is shown that the non-zero
off-diagonal component of Einstein tensor implies some severe restriction on
the choice of matter distribution. In particular for a locally rotationally
symmetric Bianchi type-II (LRS BII) space-time it is proved that the matter
distribution should be strictly isotropic if the corresponding matter field
possesses only non-zero diagonal components of the energy-momentum tensor.

``push'' queue levels towards non-zero values (avoiding underflows). We show
that when the perturbations are carefully chosen, PMW is able to achieve a
utility that is within $O(1/V)$ of the optimal value for any $V\geq1$, while

is developed in a formal thermodynamic setting, which provides guidance on
admissible constitutive relationships and on the coupling of the numerous
physical processes that are active. Phase changes are driven by
temperature-dependent free-energy functions that become non-convex below a
transition temperature. Higher-order spatial gradients are present in the model
to account for phase boundary energy, and these terms necessitate the
introduction of non-standard terms in the energy balance equation in order to
satisfy the classical entropy inequality point-wise. To solve the resulting
balance equations, a Galerkin finite element scheme is elaborated. To deal
rigorously with the presence of high-order spatial derivatives associated with
surface energies at phase boundaries in both the momentum and mass balance
equations, some novel numerical approaches are used. Numerical examples are
presented that consider boundary cooling of a domain at different rates, and
these results demonstrate that the model can qualitatively reproduce the
evolution of microstructural features that are observed in some alloys,
especially steels. The proposed model opens a number of interesting

estimation, cloning and finite de Finetti theorems. First, we consider the
measure-and-prepare channel that uses optimal estimation to convert M copies
into k approximate copies of an unknown pure state and we show that this
channel is equal to a random loss of all but s particles followed by cloning
from s to k copies. When the number k of output copies is large with respect to
the number M of input copies the measure-and-prepare channel converges in
diamond norm to the optimal universal cloning. In the opposite case, when M is
large compared to k, the estimation becomes almost perfect and the
measure-and-prepare channel converges in diamond norm to the partial trace over
all but k systems. This result is then used to derive de Finetti-type results
for quantum states and for symmetric broadcast channels, that is, channels that
distribute quantum information to many receivers in a permutationally invariant
fashion. Applications of the finite de Finetti theorem for symmetric broadcast
channels include the derivation of diamond-norm bounds on the asymptotic
convergence of quantum cloning to state estimation and the derivation of bounds
on the amount of quantum information that can be jointly decoded by a group of
k receivers at the output of a symmetric broadcast channel.

characterize the triangularity $<r^3 \cos3(\phi - \psi_{3,3})>$ and the dipole
asymmetry $<r^3 \cos(\phi- \psi_{1,3})>$ of the initial entropy distribution.
We show that for mid-peripheral collisions the orientation angle of the dipole

small net $v_1$ out of plane. In peripheral and mid-central collisions the
orientation angles $\psi_{1,3}$ and $\psi_{3,3}$ are strongly correlated. We
study the ideal hydrodynamic response to these cumulants and determine the
associated $v_1/\epsilon_1$ and $v_3/\epsilon_3$ for a massless ideal gas

freezeout. The hydrodynamic calculations for $v_3$ are compared to Alver and
Roland fit of two particle correlation functions. Finally, we propose to
measure the $v_1$ associated with the dipole asymmetry and the correlations
between $\psi_{1,3}$ and $\psi_{3,3}$ by measuring a two particle correlation
with respect to the participant plane, $<\cos(\phi_a - 3\phi_b + 2\Psi_{PP})>$.
The hydrodynamic prediction for this correlation function is several times
larger than a correlation currently measured by the STAR collaboration,
$<\cos(\phi_a + \phi_\b - 2\Psi_{PP})>$.

Our goal is to design local policies that achieve a good price of anarchy in
the resulting equilibria for unrelated machine scheduling. To obtain the
approximation bounds, we introduce a new technique that while conceptually
simple, seems to be quite powerful. With this method we are able to prove the
following results.
  First, we consider Smith's Rule, which orders the jobs on a machine in
ascending processing time to weight ratio, and show that it achieves an
approximation ratio of 4. We also demonstrate that this is the best possible
for deterministic non-preemptive strongly local policies. Since Smith's Rule is
always optimal for a given assignment, this may seem unsurprising, but we then
show that better approximation ratios can be obtained if either preemption or
randomization is allowed.
  We prove that ProportionalSharing, a preemptive strongly local policy,
achieves an approximation ratio of 2.618 for the weighted sum of completion
times, and an approximation ratio of 2.5 in the unweighted case. Again, we
observe that these bounds are tight. Next, we consider Rand, a natural
non-preemptive but randomized policy. We show that it achieves an approximation
ratio of at most 2.13; moreover, if the sum of the weighted completion times is
negligible compared to the cost of the optimal solution, this improves to \pi
/2.
  Finally, we show that both ProportionalSharing and Rand induce potential
games, and thus always have a pure Nash equilibrium (unlike Smith's Rule). This
also allows us to design the first \emph{combinatorial} constant-factor
approximation algorithm minimizing weighted completion time for unrelated
machine scheduling that achieves a factor of 2+ \epsilon for any \epsilon > 0.

theorem, the number of samples needed for a classification task increases
exponentially as the number of dimensions (variables, features) increases. On
the other hand, it is costly to collect, store and process data. Moreover,
irrelevant and redundant features might hinder classifier performance. In
exploratory analysis settings, high dimensionality prevents the users from
exploring the data visually. Feature extraction is a two-step process: feature
construction and feature selection. Feature construction creates new features
based on the original features and feature selection is the process of
selecting the best features as in filter, wrapper and embedded methods.
  In this work, we focus on feature construction methods that aim to decrease
data dimensionality for visualization tasks. Various linear (such as principal
components analysis (PCA), multiple discriminants analysis (MDA), exploratory
projection pursuit) and non-linear (such as multidimensional scaling (MDS),
manifold learning, kernel PCA/LDA, evolutionary constructive induction)

adaptive feature extraction method which consists of evolutionary constructive
induction for feature construction and a hybrid filter/wrapper method for

aims to investigate the impact of several stochastic modeling methods on
GPS-derived ZTD estimations using Australian IGS data. The results show that
the accuracy of GPS-derived ZTD can be improved using a suitable stochastic

However, a lot of the energy consumption is wasted due to the lack of global
link power coordination in these complex systems. This paper proposes several
link power coordination schemes to achieve energy-efficient routing by
progressively putting some links into energy saving mode and hence aggregating
traffic during periods of low traffic load. We show that the achievable energy
savings not only depend on the link power coordination schemes, but also on the
network topologies. In the random network, there is no scheme that can
significantly outperform others. In the scale-free network, when the largest
betweenness first (LBF) scheme is used, phase transition of the networks'
transmission capacities during the traffic cooling down phase is observed.
Motivated by this, a hybrid link power coordination scheme is proposed to
significantly reduce the energy consumption in the scale-free network. In a
real Internet Service Provider (ISP)'s router-level Internet topology, however,
the smallest betweenness first (SBF) scheme significantly outperforms other
schemes.

gave a geometric measure of quantum discord in a bipartite quantum state as the
distance of the state from the closest classical quantum (or zero discord)
state and derived an explicit formula for a two qubit state. Further, S.Luo and
S.Fu [Physical Review A \tf{82}, 034302 (2010)] obtained a generic form of this
geometric measure for a general bipartite state and established a lower bound.

by S.Luo and S.Fu.

Math. 275(1), 2011, 15-46",,,"math.CO math.AT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Let P be a convex polytope not simple in general. In the focus of this paper
lies a simplicial complex K_P which carries complete information about the
combinatorial type of P. In the case when P is simple, K_P is the same as dP*,
where P* is a polar dual polytope. Using the canonical embedding of a polytope
P into nonnegative orthant, we introduce a moment-angle space Z_P for a
polytope P. It is known, that in the case when P is simple the space Z_P is
homeomorphic to the polyhedral product (D^2,S^1)^{K_P}. When P is not simple,
we prove that the space Z_P is homotopically equivalent to the space
(D^2,S^1)^{K_P}. This allows to introduce bigraded Betti numbers for any convex
polytope. A Stanley-Reisner ring of a polytope P can be defined as a
Stanley-Reisner ring of a simplicial complex K_P. All these considerations lead
to a natural question: which simplicial complexes arise as K_P for some
polytope P? We have proceeded in this direction by introducing a notion of a
polytopic simplicial complex. It has the following property: link of each
simplex in a polytopic complex is either contractible, or retractible to a
subcomplex, homeomorphic to a sphere. The complex K_P is a polytopic simplicial
complex for any polytope P. Links of so called face simplices in a polytopic
complex are polytopic complexes as well. This fact is sufficient enough to
connect face polynomial of a simplicial complex K_P to the face polynomial of a
polytope P, giving a series of inequalities on certain combinatorial
characteristics of P. Two of these inequalities are equalities for each P and
represent Euler-Poincare formula and one of Bayer-Billera relations for flag
f-numbers. In the case when P is simple all inequalities turn out to be
classical Dehn-Sommerville relations.

the 5-dimensional Anti-de Sitter universe. When the mass $\mu$ is larger than
$-{1}{4}$, the Cauchy problem is well posed despite the loss of global
hyperbolicity due to the time-like horizon. We express the finite energy
solutions in the form of a continuous Kaluza-Klein tower and we deduce a
uniform decay as $\mid t\mid^{-{3}{2}}$. We investigate the case
$\mu={\nu^2-1}{2}$, $\nu\in\NN^*$, which encompasses the gravitational
fluctuations, $\nu=4$, and the electromagnetic waves, $\nu=2$. The propagation
of the wave front set shows that the horizon acts like a perfect mirror. We
establish that the smooth solutions decay as $\mid
t\mid^{-2-\sqrt{\mu+{1}{4}}}$, and we get global $L^p$ estimates of Strichartz
type. When $\nu$ is even, there appears a lacuna and the equipartition of the
energy occurs at finite time for the compactly supported initial data, although
the Huygens principle fails. We adress the cosmological model of the negative
tension Minkowski brane, on which a Robin boundary condition is imposed. We
prove the hyperbolic mixed problem is well-posed and the normalizable solutions
can be expanded into a discrete Kaluza-Klein tower. We establish some
$L^2-L^{\infty}$ estimates in suitable weighted Sobolev spaces.

spectroscopy. It is revealed that the Ge-Ge and Si-Ge vibrational modes are
considerably enhanced upon excitation of excitons between the valence band
$\Lambda_3$ and the conduction band $\Lambda_1$ (the E1 and E1 + $\Delta_1$
transitions). This makes it possible to observe the Raman spectrum of very
small amounts of germanium, such as one layer of quantum dots with a germanium
layer thickness of 10 \r{A}. The enhancement of these modes suggests a strong
electron-phonon interaction of the vibrational modes with the E1 and E1 +
$\Delta_1$ excitons in the quantum dot. It is demonstrated that the frequency
of the Ge-Ge mode decreases by 10 cm^-1 with a decrease in the thickness of the
Ge layer from 10 to 6 \r{A} due to the spatial-confinement effect. The optimum
thickness of the Ge layer, for which the size dispersion of quantum dots is
minimum, is determined.

that with no electric field, the nucleus of an atom is at the centre of the
electron cloud, atoms do not have permanent electric dipole moment (EDM), so
that there is no polar atom in nature. In the fact, the idea is untested
hypothesis. After ten years of intense research, our experiments showed that
atoms can be divided into three categories: polar, non-polar and hydrogen atom.
Alkali atoms are all polar atoms. The EDM of a Sodium, Potassium, Rubidium and
Cesium atom in the ground state have been obtained as follows: d(Na)=1.28*10
to-8 power e.cm; d(K)=1.58*10 to-8 power e.cm; d(Rb)=1.70 *10 to-8 power e.cm;
d(Cs)=1.86*10 to-8 power e.cm. All kind of atoms are non-polar atoms except for
alkali and hydrogen atoms. Hydrogen atom is quite distinct from the others. The
ground state in hydrogen is non-polar atom(d=0) but the excited state is polar
