exchange information through a cluster of relay nodes. The relay nodes receive
the sum signal from S1 and S2 in the first time slot. In the second time slot,
each relay node multiplies its received signal by a complex coefficient and
retransmits the signal to the two source nodes, which leads to a collaborative
two-way beamforming system. By applying the principle of analog network coding,
each receiver at S1 and S2 cancels the ""self-interference"" in the received
signal from the relay cluster and decodes the message. This paper studies the
2-dimensional achievable rate region for such a two-way relay network with
collaborative beamforming. With different assumptions of channel reciprocity
between the source-relay and relay-source channels, the achievable rate region
is characterized under two setups. First, with reciprocal channels, we
investigate the achievable rate regions when the relay cluster is subject to a
sum-power constraint or individual-power constraints. We show that the optimal
beamforming vectors obtained from solving the weighted sum inverse-SNR
minimization (WSISMin) problems are sufficient to characterize the
corresponding achievable rate region. Furthermore, we derive the closed form
solutions for those optimal beamforming vectors and consequently propose the
partially distributed algorithms to implement the optimal beamforming, where
each relay node only needs the local channel information and one global
parameter. Second, with the non-reciprocal channels, the achievable rate
regions are also characterized for both the sum-power constraint case and the
individual-power constraint case. Although no closed-form solutions are
available under this setup, we present efficient numerical algorithms.

is available. There are many situations where these requirements are not
fulfilled such as; developing nations, rural areas, natural disasters, and
military conflicts to name but a few. A practical solution is to use mobile
devices interconnected via a wireless medium to form a network, known as a
Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET), and provide the services normally found in wired
networks. Security in MANETs is an issue of paramount importance due to the
wireless nature of the communication links. Additionally due to the lack of
central administration security issues are different from conventional
networks. For the purposes of this article we have used the ""WMN test-bed"" to
enable secure routing in MANETs. The use of cryptography is an efficient proven
way of securing data in communications, but some cryptographic algorithms are
not as efficient as others and require more processing power, which is
detrimental to MANETs. In this article we have assessed different cryptographic
approaches to securing the OLSR (Optimised Link State Routing) protocol to
provide a basis for research. We conclude the paper with a series of
performance evaluation results regarding different cryptographic and hashing
schemes. Our findings clearly show that the most efficient combination of
algorithms used for authentication and encryption are SHA-1 and AES
respectively. Using this combination over their counterparts will lead to a
considerable reduction in processing time and delay on the network, creating an
efficient transaction moving towards satisfying resource constraints and
security requirements.

Imager covering the energy range of 5-80 keV. The SGD achieves low background
by combining a Compton camera scheme with a narrow field-of-view active shield
where Compton kinematics is utilized to reject backgrounds. The Compton camera
in the SGD is realized as a hybrid semiconductor detector system which consists
of silicon and CdTe (cadmium telluride) sensors. Good energy resolution is
afforded by semiconductor sensors, and it results in good background rejection
capability due to better constraints on Compton kinematics. Utilization of
Compton kinematics also makes the SGD sensitive to the gamma-ray polarization,
opening up a new window to study properties of gamma-ray emission processes.

physically motivated supernova feedback prescription we show that the standard
cold dark matter model can account for extant observed properties of damped
Lyman alpha systems (DLAs). We then examine the properties of DLA host
galaxies. We find: (1) While DLA hosts roughly trace the overall population of
galaxies at all redshifts, they are always gas rich. (2) The history of DLA
evolution reflects primarily the evolution of the underlying cosmic density,
galaxy size and galaxy interactions. With higher density and more interactions
at high redshift DLAs are larger in both absolute terms and in relative terms
with respect to virial radii of halos. (3) The variety of DLAs at high redshift
is richer with a large contribution coming from galactic filaments, created
through close galaxy interactions. The portion of gaseous disks of galaxies
where most stars reside makes relatively small contribution to DLA incidence at
z=3-4. (4) The vast majority of DLAs arise in halos of mass M_h=10^10-10^12
Msun at z=1.6-4. At z=3-4, 20-30% of DLA hosts are Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs).
(5) Galactic winds play an indispensable role in shaping the kinematic
properties of DLAs. Specifically, the high velocity width DLAs are a mixture of
those arising in high mass, high velocity dispersion halos and those arising in
smaller mass systems where cold gas clouds are entrained to high velocities by
galactic winds. (6) In agreement with observations, we see a weak but
noticeable evolution in DLA metallicity. The metallicity distribution centers
at [Z/H]=-1.5 to -1 at z=3-4, with the peak moving to [Z/H]=-0.75 at z=1.6 and
[Z/H]=-0.5 by z=0. (7) The star formation rate of DLA hosts is concentrated in
the range 0.3-30Msun/yr at z=3-4, gradually shifting lower to peak at ~0.5-1
Msun/yr by z=0.

functions and the invariances acting on their domain which preserve the
property was initiated by Kaufman and Sudan (STOC 2008). Invariance with
respect to F_2-linear transformations is arguably the most common symmetry
exhibited by natural properties of Boolean functions on the hypercube. Hence,
an important goal in Property Testing is to describe necessary and sufficient
conditions for the testability of linear-invariant properties. This direction
was explicitly proposed for investigation in a recent survey of Sudan.
  We obtain the following results:
  1. We show that every linear-invariant property that can be characterized by
forbidding induced solutions to a (possibly infinite) set of linear equations
can be tested with one-sided error.
  2. We show that every linear-invariant property that can be tested with
one-sided error can be characterized by forbidding induced solutions to a
(possibly infinite) set of systems of linear equations.
  We conjecture that our result from item (1) can be extended to cover systems
of linear equations. We further show that the validity of this conjecture would
have the following implications:
  1. It would imply that every linear-invariant property that is closed under
restrictions to linear subspaces is testable with one-sided error. Such a
result would unify several previous results on testing Boolean functions, such
as the testability of low-degree polynomials and of Fourier dimensionality.
  2. It would imply that a linear-invariant property P is testable with
one-sided error if and only if P is closed under restrictions to linear
subspaces, thus resolving Sudan's problem.

complexity of systems consisting of many simultaneously moving entities. As
such, these models allow the establishing of a few fundamental principles of
flocking. In particular, it is demonstrated, that in spite of considerable

circuit as a result of increasing the voltage-dependent charge carrier density

the bulk heterojunction materials and the measured open circuit voltage at room

quantum error correction. In doing so, we propose a new quantum computer
architecture based on optical control of quantum dots. The timescales of
physical hardware operations and logical, error-corrected quantum gates differ
by several orders of magnitude. By dividing functionality into layers, we can
design and analyze subsystems independently, demonstrating the value of our
layered architectural approach. Using this concrete hardware platform, we
provide resource analysis for executing fault-tolerant quantum algorithms for
integer factoring and quantum simulation, finding that the quantum dot

well-posedness results established recently by R. Danchin and M. Paicu for the
Boussinesq system with anisotropic viscosity and zero diffusion. Although we
follow some of their ideas, in proving the uniqueness result, we have used an
alternative approach by writing the transported temperature (density) as
$\theta = \Delta\xi$ and adapting the techniques of V. Yudovich for the 2D
incompressible Euler equations. This new idea allows us to establish uniqueness
results with fewer assumptions on the initial data for the transported quantity
$\theta$. Furthermore, this new technique allows us to establish uniqueness
results without having to resort to the paraproduct calculus of J. Bony.
  We also propose an inviscid $\alpha$-regularization for the two-dimensional
inviscid, non-diffusive Boussinesq system of equations, which we call the
Boussinesq-Voigt equations. Global regularity of this system is established.
Moreover, we establish the convergence of solutions of the Boussinesq-Voigt
model to the corresponding solutions of the two-dimensional Boussinesq system
of equations for inviscid flow without heat (density) diffusion on the interval
of existence of the latter. Furthermore, we derive a criterion for finite-time
blow-up of the solutions to the inviscid, non-diffusive 2D Boussinesq system

Voigt-$\alpha$ regularization for the inviscid 3D Boussinesq equations with

Their utilization ratio is only 5 to 10 percent. This paper focuses on the use
of an emerging technology called virtualization to achieve energy efficient

test CNVs along with SNPs, after inferring copy number status from the data

a related quantity called quantumness. We find that the classicality of an

that the quantumness of an ensemble is essentially responsible for the security

then emit luminescence with high quantum efficiency, which finally be collected
by a small photovoltaic (PV) system. The light-harvesting area of the PV system
is much smaller than that of the LSC system, potentially improving the
efficiency and reducing the cost of solar cells. Here, based on Fermi-golden
rule, we present a theoretical description of the luminescent process in
nanoscale LSCs where the conventional ray-optics model is no longer applicable.
As an example calculated with this new model, we demonstrate that a slot
waveguide consisting of a nanometer-sized low-index slot region sandwiched by
two high-index regions provides a broadband enhancement of light harvesting by
the luminescent centers in the slot region. This is because the slot waveguide
can (1) greatly enhance the spontaneous emission due to the Purcell effect, (2)
dramatically increase the effective absorption cross-section of luminescent
centers, and (3) strongly improve the quantum efficiency of luminescent
centers. It is found that about 80% solar photons can be ultimately converted
to waveguide-coupled luminescent photons even for a low luminescent quantum
efficiency of 0.5. This LSC is potential to construct a tandem structure which
can absorb nearly full-spectrum solar photons, and also may be of special
interest for building integrated nano-PV applications.

by vortex shedding (VIV), which cause fatigue damage and other problems. VIV
models in engineering use today tend to operate in the frequency domain. A time
domain model would allow to capture the chaotic nature of VIV and to model
interactions with other loads and non-linearities. Such a model was developed
in the present work: for each cross section, recent velocity history is
compressed using Laguerre polynomials. The compressed information is used to
enter an interpolation function to predict the instantaneous force, allowing to
step the dynamic analysis. An offshore riser was modeled in this way: Some
analyses provided an unusually fine level of realism, while in other analyses,
the riser fell into an unphysical pattern of vibration. It is concluded that
the concept is promissing, yet that more work is needed to understand orbit

Density Functional. Assuming that the many-nucleon driven dynamics of nuclear
surface deformation can be simulated by effective bosonic degrees of freedom,
the Gogny-D1S potential energy surface (PES) with quadrupole degrees of freedom
is mapped onto the corresponding PES of the IBM. Using this mapping procedure,
the parameters of the IBM Hamiltonian, relevant to the low-lying quadrupole

Merits of both Gogny-HFB and IBM approaches are utilized so that the spectra

charmed and unflavored hadron decay, and photon conversion into a muon pair).
We pay special attention to the contribution from unflavored mesons (eta, eta',
rho0, omega and phi). These mesons are abundant in air showers, their lifetimes
are much shorter than those of charged pions or kaons, and they have decay
branching ratios of order 10^-4 into final states containing a muon pair. We
show that they may be the dominant source of muons at E_mu >10^3 TeV.

emission (ARPES) tremendously during the last one or two decades. In particular
improved momentum and energy resolution as well as the use of photon energies
from few eV up to several keV makes ARPES a rather unique tool to investigate
the electronic properties of solids and surfaces. Obviously, this rises the
need for a corresponding theoretical formalism that allows to accompany
experimental ARPES studies in an adequate way. As will be demonstrated by
several examples this goal could be achieved by various recent developments on
the basis of the one-step model of photo emission: The spin-orbit induced
Rashba-splitting of Shockley-type surface states is discussed using a fully
relativistic description. The impact of chemical disorder within surface layers
can be handled by means of the Coherent Potential Approximation (CPA) alloy
theory. Calculating phonon properties together with the corresponding
electron-phonon self-energy allows a direct comparison with features in the
ARPES spectra caused by electron-phonon interaction. The same holds for the
influence of electronic correlation effects. These are accounted for by means
of the dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) that removes the most serious short
comings of standard calculations based on the standard LDA. The combination of
this approach with the CPA allows the investigation of correlated transition
metal alloys. Finally, accounting for the photon momentum and going beyond the
single scatter approximation for the final state allows to deal quantitatively
with ARPES in the HAXPES regime that reduces the influence of the surface on
the spectra and probing primarily the bulk electronic structure this way.
Corresponding calculations of ARPES spectra, however, have to deal with thermal
vibrations in an adequate way.

The cooling sequences provide a link between the white dwarf chemical structure
and the age of the supernova progenitor system. The cooling sequence of a 1
M_sun white dwarf was computed until freezing using an up-to-date stellar
evolutionary code. We computed explosions of both Chandrasekhar mass and
sub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs, assuming spherical symmetry and neglecting
convective mixing during the pre-supernova carbon simmering phase to maximize
the effects of chemical separation. Neither gravitational settling of 22Ne nor
chemical differentiation of 12C and 16O have an appreciable impact on the
properties of Type Ia supernovae, unless there is a direct dependence of the
flame properties (density of transition from deflagration to detonation) on the
chemical composition. At a fixed transition density, the maximum variation in
the supernova magnitude obtained from progenitors of different ages is ~0.06
magnitudes, and even assuming an unrealistically large diffusion coefficient of
22Ne it would be less than ~0.09 mag. However, if the transition density
depends on the chemical composition (all other things being equal) the oldest
SNIa can be as much as 0.4 magnitudes brighter than the youngest ones (in our
models the age difference is 7.4 Gyr). In addition, our results show that 22Ne

system of two spin-1/2 particles moving in the curved spacetime is discussed.
The system is described by a two-particle Gaussian wave packet represented in
the momentum space and both the acceleration of the system and the curvature of
the spacetime cause to produce a Wigner rotation acting on the wave packet as
it moves along a path in the curved spacetime. By calculating the reduced
density operator at a final point, we focus on the spin entanglement of the
system. In a spherically symmetric and static gravitational field, for example
a charged black hole, there can be particular paths on which the Wigner
rotation is trivial and so the initial reduced density matrix remains intact.
This causes the spin entanglement to be invariant during the motion. The spin
entanglement descends to zero by increasing the angular velocity of the mean
centroid of the system as well increasing the proper time during which the
centroid moves on its circular path around the center.

unambiguous statistical recipe to derive the sensitivity to a putative Majorana
neutrino mass, m_bb. In order to make sense of how the different experimental
approaches compare, we apply this recipe to a selection of proposals, comparing
the resulting sensitivities. We also propose a ""physics-motivated range"" (PMR)
of the nuclear matrix elements as a unifying criterium between the different
nuclear models. The expected performance of the proposals is parametrized in
terms of only four numbers: energy resolution, background rate (per unit time,
isotope mass and energy), detection efficiency, and bb isotope mass. For each
proposal, both a reference and an optimistic scenario for the experimental
performance are studied. In the reference scenario we find that all the
proposals will be able to partially explore the degenerate spectrum, without
fully covering it, although four of them (KamLAND-Zen, CUORE, NEXT and EXO)
will approach the 50 meV boundary. In the optimistic scenario, we find that
CUORE and the xenon-based proposals (KamLAND-Zen, EXO and NEXT) will explore a
significant fraction of the inverse hierarchy, with NEXT covering it almost
fully. For the long term future, we argue that Xe-based experiments may provide
the best case for a 1-ton scale experiment, given the potentially very low
backgrounds achievable and the expected scalability to large isotope masses.

least once through the newspapers, TV and Internet that a new asteroid has been
discovered with non-zero (sometimes ""high"") probability of collision with the
Earth in the near future. Since early 2000's, such probabilities are routinely
calculated by two impact monitoring systems (one in the US, the other in
Europe) on preliminary orbits of newly discovered Near Earth Asteroids (NEAs),
and are regularly updated whenever additional new astrometric observations for
each threatening object become available. A typical pattern is that as the
orbit becomes more precisely determined, impact probability often increases
initially, but then turns around and decreases until it falls to zero, or some
very low number.
  In the present study we define a probability measure which provides a simple
tool to evaluate from the very beginning the chance that the impact probability
calculated by monitoring systems for a threatening object will reach unity at
the end of the overall process of orbit refinement. We stress that this chance
is independent of the specific (fluctuating) value of the probability
calculated by the monitoring systems. In a precise sense, which should be clear
throughout the paper, the concrete impact probability of a newly discovered
asteroid is not that given by the monitoring systems.

linear transform followed by a componentwise, probabilistic (possibly
nonlinear) measurement channel. A novel algorithm, called generalized
approximate message passing (GAMP), is presented that provides computationally
efficient approximate implementations of max-sum and sum-problem loopy belief
propagation for such problems. The algorithm extends earlier approximate
message passing methods to incorporate arbitrary distributions on both the
input and output of the transform and can be applied to a wide range of
problems in nonlinear compressed sensing and learning.
  Extending an analysis by Bayati and Montanari, we argue that the asymptotic
componentwise behavior of the GAMP method under large, i.i.d. Gaussian
transforms is described by a simple set of state evolution (SE) equations. From
the SE equations, one can \emph{exactly} predict the asymptotic value of
virtually any componentwise performance metric including mean-squared error or
detection accuracy. Moreover, the analysis is valid for arbitrary input and
output distributions, even when the corresponding optimization problems are
non-convex. The results match predictions by Guo and Wang for relaxed belief
propagation on large sparse matrices and, in certain instances, also agree with
the optimal performance predicted by the replica method. The GAMP methodology
thus provides a computationally efficient methodology, applicable to a large
class of non-Gaussian estimation problems with precise asymptotic performance
guarantees.

and zirconium. After calculating oscillator strengths (for Ge, Y and Zr), the
photospheric abundances of these elements were established to range from 3 dex
(Ge) to 4 dex (Sr, Y and Zr) above solar. The most likely explanation is that
these overabundances are caused by radiatively-driven diffusion forming a
chemical cloud layer in the photosphere. It is conjectured that this cloud
formation could be mediated by a strong magnetic field.

category-type arguments, we exhibit an analogue to Geometric Langlands Theory
in an entirely model-independent, non-perturbative,purely smooth topological

Theory, as a whole, is already, ab initio, a universal canonical 2D
sigma-model, targeting smooth, compact, simply-connected 4-manifolds with a
connected boundary, and its topological Planckian quantum starting point, as
well as its cone-like, infinitely-generated at each stage, graded group of
homology-preserving, but topology-changing transitions/interactions, exhibit
the most general qualitative S-duality. We first point out the numerous
mathematically rigorous, model-free, (i.e., intrinsic), topological AP
analogues with the heuristic Kapustin-Witten version of Geometric Langlands
theory, as well as the crucial differences between the two theories. The latter
have to exist since AP Theory deals, a priori, essentially only with discrete
group-theoretic presentation theory, not Lie group representation theory, not
with category nor moduli theory, does not need classical SUSY, nor Feynman
integrals, lattice models, etc., and furthermore is model-independent and
characteristic of real dimension four. It will become clear that AP Langlands
theory is a model-independent, cone-like, graded, compact completion and
topological 'envelope' of 4D N=4 SUSY YM theory, their starting point,
anchored, kept in place, so to speak, by a purely discrete group-theoretic
analogue of Donaldson/Seiberg-Witten theory. Due to its discrete
group-theoretic conceptual simplicity and universality, the AP Langlands

and high-mass cluster stars into their gasoeus environment. The main
conclusions are that i) outflow driving appears capable of maintaing the
turbulence in parsec-sized clumps and retarding their collapse from the
free-fall rate, although there exist regions within molecular clouds, and even
some examples of whole clouds, which are not actively forming stars, yet are
just as turbulent, so that a more universal turbulence-driving mechanism is
needed; ii) outflow-driven turbulence exhibits specific spectral features that
can be tested observationally; iii) feedback plays an important role in
reducing the star formation rate; iv) nevertheless, numerical simulations
suggest that feedback cannot completely prevent a net contracting motion of
clouds and clumps. Therefore, an appealing source for driving the turbulence
everywhere in GMCs is the accretion from the environment, at all scales. In
this case, feedback's most important role may be to prevent a fraction of the
gas nearest to newly formed stars from actually reaching them, thus reducing
the star formation efficiency.

antiferromagnetic system, namely the Union Jack model, are studied using the

quantum number $s=1$ and $s=3/2$. The system is defined on a square lattice and
the spins interact via isotropic Heisenberg interactions such that all
nearest-neighbour (NN) exchange bonds are present with identical strength
$J_{1}>0$, and only half of the next-nearest-neighbour (NNN) exchange bonds are
present with identical strength $J_{2} \equiv \kappa J_{1} > 0$. The bonds are
arranged such that on the $2 \times 2$ unit cell they form the pattern of the
Union Jack flag. Clearly, the NN bonds by themselves (viz., with $J_{2}=0$)
produce an antiferromagnetic N\'{e}el-ordered phase, but as the relative
strength $\kappa$ of the frustrating NNN bonds is increased a phase transition
occurs in the classical case ($s \rightarrow \infty$) at $\kappa^{\rm
cl}_{c}=0.5$ to a canted ferrimagnetic phase. In the quantum cases considered
here we also find strong evidence for a corresponding phase transition between
a N\'{e}el-ordered phase and a quantum canted ferrimagnetic phase at a critical

example of helical Fermi liquids, i.e. quantum liquids in which spin (or
pseudospin) and momentum degrees-of-freedom at the Fermi surface have a
well-defined correlation. Here we study the long-wavelength plasmon dispersion
and the Drude weight of archetypical spin-orbit-coupled 2DEGs. We first show
that these measurable quantities are sensitive to electron-electron
interactions due to broken Galileian invariance and then discuss in detail why
the popular random phase approximation is not capable of describing the
collective dynamics of these systems even at very long wavelengths. This work
is focussed on presenting approximate microscopic calculations of these
quantities based on the minimal theoretical scheme that captures the basic
physics correctly, i.e. the time-dependent Hartree-Fock approximation. We find
that interactions enhance the ""plasmon mass"" and suppress the Drude weight. Our
findings can be tested by inelastic light scattering, electron energy loss, and
far-infrared optical-absorption measurements.

information about the physical characteristics of hot optically thin plasma
sources from their EUV and X-ray spectra. We describe and test an iterative
method developed within the framework of a probabilistic approach to the
spectral inverse problem for determining the thermal structures of the emitting
plasma. We also demonstrate applications of this method to both high resolution
line spectra and broadband imaging data. Our so-called Bayesian iterative
method (BIM) is an iterative procedure based on Bayes' theorem and is used to
reconstruct differential emission measure (DEM) distributions. To demonstrate
the abilities of the BIM, we performed various numerical tests and model
simulations establishing its robustness and usefulness. We then applied the BIM
to observable data for several active regions (AR) previously analyzed with
other DEM diagnostic techniques: both SUMER/SOHO (Landi and Feldman, 2008) and
SPIRIT/CORONAS-F (Shestov et al., 2010) line spectra data, and XRT/Hinode
(Reale et al., 2009) broadband imaging data. The BIM results show that this
method is an effective tool for determining the thermal structure of emitting
plasma and can be successfully used for the DEM analysis of both line spectra
and broadband imaging data. The BIM calculations correlate with recent studies
confirming the existence of hot plasma in solar ARs. The BIM results also
indicate that the coronal plasma may have the continuous distributions
predicted by the nanoflare paradigm.

stochastic risk models with respect to extreme portfolio losses. In the
framework of multivariate regular variation comparison criteria are derived in
terms of ordering conditions on the spectral measures, which allows for
analytical or numerical verification in practical applications. Additional
comparison criteria in terms of further stochastic orderings are derived. The
application examples include worst case and best case scenarios, elliptically
contoured distributions, and multivariate regularly varying models with Gumbel,
Archimedean, and Galambos copulas.
