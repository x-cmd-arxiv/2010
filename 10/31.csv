general scenario. It is found that, in an appropriate parameter domain, the
ground state may or may not respect PT-symmetry. Interestingly, in the domain
where PT-symmetry is not respected, two superpotentials give rise to one
potential; whereas when the ground state respects PT, this correspondence is
unique. In both scenarios, supersymmetry and shape-invariance are intact,
through which one can obtain eigenfunctions and eigenstates exactly. Our
procedure enables one to generate a host of complex potentials which are not
PT-symmetric, and can be exactly solved.

at lower temperatures. We show for the first time that the temperature
dependence of the coherent phonon frequency is anomalous (i.e, increasing with

electron-phonon interaction. At the highest photoexcited carrier density of

absorption and carrier diffusion reveal that the diffusion of carriers
dominates the non-oscillatory electronic part of the time-resolved

a long-standing open problem that has led to development of many heuristics but
no provable results for our particular problem. Given a set $V$ of $n$
elements, we wish to linearly order them given pairwise preference labels. A
pairwise preference label is obtained as a response, typically from a human, to
the question ""which if preferred, u or v?$ for two elements $u,v\in V$. We
assume possible non-transitivity paradoxes which may arise naturally due to
human mistakes or irrationality. The goal is to linearly order the elements
from the most preferred to the least preferred, while disagreeing with as few
pairwise preference labels as possible. Our performance is measured by two
parameters: The loss and the query complexity (number of pairwise preference
labels we obtain). This is a typical learning problem, with the exception that
the space from which the pairwise preferences is drawn is finite, consisting of
${n\choose 2}$ possibilities only. We present an active learning algorithm for
this problem, with query bounds significantly beating general (non active)
bounds for the same error guarantee, while almost achieving the information
theoretical lower bound. Our main construct is a decomposition of the input
s.t. (i) each block incurs high loss at optimum, and (ii) the optimal solution
respecting the decomposition is not much worse than the true opt. The
decomposition is done by adapting a recent result by Kenyon and Schudy for a
related combinatorial optimization problem to the query efficient setting. We
thus settle an open problem posed by learning-to-rank theoreticians and
practitioners: What is a provably correct way to sample preference labels? To
further show the power and practicality of our solution, we show how to use it
in concert with an SVM relaxation.

related eigenfrequencies of a disordered photonic crystal, characterized by
small fluctuations of the otherwise periodic dielectric profile. The field
eigenmodes are expanded on the basis of Bloch modes of the corresponding
periodic structure, and the resulting eigenvalue problem is diagonalized on a
truncated basis including a finite number of Bloch bands. The Bloch-mode
expansion is very effective for modeling modes of very extended disordered
structures in a given frequency range, as only spectrally close bands must be
included in the basis set. The convergence can be easily verified by repeating
the diagonalization for an increased band set. As illustrations, we apply the
method to the W1 line-defect waveguide and to the L3 coupled-cavity waveguide,
both based on a photonic crystal slab with a triangular lattice of circular
holes. We compute and characterize the eigenfrequencies, spatial field profiles
and radiation loss rates of the localized modes induced by disorder. For the W1
waveguide, we demonstrate that radiation losses, at the bottom of the
spatially-even guided band, are determined by a small hybridization with Bloch
modes of the spatially-odd band, induced by disorder in spite of their
frequency separation. The Bloch-mode expansion method has a very broad range of
applications: it can be also used to accurately compute the modes of structures
with systematic modulations of the periodic dielectric constant, as in several
designs of high-Q cavities.

X-ray light curve. Despite extensive studies, however, the optical light curve
has never been discussed and its redshift is unconstrained. Possible
correlations between optical and X-ray data are analysed. Methods: Photometric
data from TNG in the R and I bands were used to compare the optical afterglow
with the X-ray light curve. The HyperZ package and a late time VLT host
observation were used to derive redshift estimates. Results: The I-band
afterglow decay followed a power-law of index {\alpha} = 2.1 $\pm$ 0.6, after a
late break at ~ $1.3 \times 10^5$ s. The R - I color is remarkably red and the
broadband spectral index {\beta}_OX = $0.9 \pm 0.1$ is consistent with the
X-ray spectral slope {\beta}_X. Although a photometric redshift of z > 4 is the
most conservative result to consider, a photometric redshift of z = 5.2 $\pm$
0.3 is suggested with no extinction in the host, based on which an isotropic
energy E_{\gamma},iso = $(3.8 \pm 0.7) \times 10^52$ erg and a jet opening
angle {\theta} ~ $3.7^{\circ}$ are subsequently derived.
  Conclusions: The combined X-ray and optical data suggest an achromatic break,
which we interpret as a jet break. The post jet break slope obeys roughly the
closure relation for the jet slow cooling model. Because of the afterglow's
very red color, in order for the redshift to be low (z < 1), extinction, if
present in the host, must be significantly high. Since the optical-to-X-ray
index is consistent with the X-ray spectrum, and there is no XRT evidence for
excess N_H, GRB 050502B was likely at high redshift.

self-unitarizes at high-energies via creation of classical configurations

derivatively-self-coupled scalar that serves as a prototype for a
Nambu-Goldstone-St\""uckelberg field. We prepare the initial state in form of a
collapsing wave-packet of a small occupation number but of very high energy,
and observe that the classical configuration indeed develops. Our results
confirm the previous estimates, showing that because of self-sourcing the
wave-packet forms a classicalon configuration with radius that increases with
center of mass energy. Thanks to self-sourcing by energy, unlike solitons, the
production of classicalons dominates the high-energy scattering. In order to
confront classicalizing and non-classicalizing theories, we use a language in
which the scattering cross section can be universally understood as a geometric
cross section set by a classical radius down to which waves can propagate
freely. The difference is, that in non-classicalizing examples this radius
shrinks with increasing energy, whereas in classicalizing theories expands and
becomes macroscopic. We study analogous scattering in a Galileon system and
discover that classicalization is less efficient there. We thus observe, that
classicalization is source-sensitive and that Goldstones pass the first test.

Aims. In order to provide further insights into its origin, we present the

Methods. We obtained high resolution (R=30000) spectra for one red giant star
in Pal\,1 using the High Dispersion Spectrograph (HDS) mounted at the SUBARU
telescope. We used ATLAS-9 model atmospheres coupled with the SYNTHE and WIDTH
calculation codes to derive chemical abundances from the measured line
equivalent widths of 18 among $\alpha$, Iron-peak, light and heavy elements.
Results. The Palomar~1 chemical pattern is broadly compatible to that of the MW
open clusters population and similar to disk stars. It is, instead, remarkably
different from that of the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf spheroidal galaxy.
Conclusions. If Pal\,1 association with either CMa or GASS will be confirmed,
this will imply that these systems had a chemical evolution similar to that of

radiation is investigated to find information on molecular outflows based on
magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) and radiation transfer simulations. There are two
major proposed models for the driving of molecular outflows: (1) molecular gas
is accelerated by a magnetic pressure gradient or magnetocentrifugal wind
mechanism before the magnetic field and molecular gas are decoupled, (2) the
linear momentum of a highly collimated jet is transferred to the ambient
molecular gas. In order to distinguish between these two models, it is crucial
to observe the configuration of the magnetic field. An observation of a
toroidal magnetic field is strong evidence that the first of the models is
appropriate. In this paper, we calculated the polarization distribution of
thermal dust radiation due to the alignment of dust grains along the magnetic
field using molecular outflow data calculated by two-dimensional axisymmetric
MHD simulations. An asymmetric distribution around the z-axis is characteristic
for magnetic fields composed of both poloidal and toroidal components. We
determined that the outflow has a low polarization degree compared with the
envelope and that the envelope and outflow have different polarization
directions (B-vector), namely, the magnetic field within the envelope is
parallel to the global magnetic field lines while the magnetic field of the
outflow is perpendicular to it. Thus we have demonstrated that the
point-symmetric (rather than axisymmetric) distributions of low polarization
regions indicate that molecular outflows are likely to be magnetically driven.
Observations of this polarization distribution with tools such as ALMA would
confirm the origin of the molecular outflow.

  be misleading","15 pags, 7 figures, submitted to Phys. A",,,,"cs.NI stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Graphical models are frequently used to represent topological structures of
various complex networks. Current criteria to assess different models of a
network mainly rely on how close a model matches the network in terms of
topological characteristics. Typical topological metrics are clustering
coefficient, distance distribution, the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency
matrix, and the gap between the first and the second largest eigenvalues, which
are widely used to evaluate and compare different models of a network. In this
paper, we show that evaluating complex network models based on the current
topological metrics can be quite misleading. Taking several models of the
AS-level Internet as examples, we show that although a model seems to be good
to describe the Internet in terms of the aforementioned topological
characteristics, it is far from being realistic to represent the real Internet
in performances such as robustness in resisting intentional attacks and traffic
load distributions. We further show that it is not useful to assess network
models by examining some topological characteristics such as clustering
coefficient and distance distribution, if robustness of the Internet against
random node removals is the only concern. Our findings shed new lights on how

prove that an algorithm based on a set of conditional mutual information tests

n), and has a computational complexity of O(n^4). A simpler algorithm based on
correlation thresholding outputs a graph with a constant edit distance to the

required is \Omega(\log n). Under a more stringent condition, correlation
thresholding is consistent for structure estimation. We finally prove a lower
bound that \Omega(c\log n) samples are also needed for consistent
reconstruction of random graphs by any algorithm with positive probability,

are studied with multi-wavelength observational data from radio, X-ray, GeV
$\gamma$-ray to TeV $\gamma$-ray band. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo method is
employed to explore the high-dimensional model parameter space systematically.
Three scenarios for the $\gamma$-ray emission are investigated: the leptonic,
the hadronic and a hybrid one. Thermal emission from the background plasma is
also included to constrain the gas density, assuming ionization equilibrium,
and a 2$\sigma$ upper limit of about 0.03 cm$^{-3}$ is obtained as far as
thermal energies account for a significant fraction of the dissipated kinetic
energy of the SNR shock. Although systematic errors dominate the $\chi^2$ of
the spectral fit of all models, we find that 1) the leptonic model has the best
constrained model parameters, whose values can be easily accommodated with a
typical supernova, but gives relatively poor fit to the TeV $\gamma$-ray data;
2) The hybrid scenario has one more parameter than the leptonic one and
improves the overall spectral fit significantly; 3) The hadronic one, which has
three more parameters than the leptonic model, gives the best fit to the
overall spectrum with relatively not-well-constrained model parameters and very
hard spectra of accelerated particles. The uncertainties of the model
parameters decrease significantly if the spectral indices of accelerated
electrons and protons are the same. The hybrid and hadronic models also require
an energy input into high-energy protons, which seems to be too high compared
with typical values of a supernova explosion. Further investigations are
required to reconcile these observations with SNR theories.

above those characteristic of smectic A phases, reentrant nematic phases form
that are characterized by a large value of the nematic order parameter
$S\simeq1$. Along the nematic director these ""supernematic"" phases exhibit a
remarkably high self-diffusivity which exceeds that for ordinary, lower-density
nematic phases by an order of magnitude. Enhancement of self-diffusivity is
attributed to a decrease of rotational configurational entropy in confinement.
Recent developments in the pulsed field gradient NMR technique are shown to
provide favorable conditions for an experimental confirmation of our

invariant mass operator in the point form of Poincar\'e-invariant relativistic
dynamics. The quark-quark interaction is furnished by a linear confinement,
consistent with the QCD string tension, and a hyperfine interaction derived
from Goldstone-boson exchange. The main advantage of the point-form approach is
the possibility of calculating manifestly covariant observables, since the
generators of Lorentz transformations remain interaction-free. We discuss the
static properties of the mass-operator eigenstates, such as the invariant mass
spectra of light- and heavy-flavor baryons, the characteristics of the
eigenstates in terms of their spin, flavor, and spatial dependences as well as
their classification into spin-flavor multiplets. Regarding dynamical
observables we address the electroweak structures of the nucleon and hyperon
ground states, including their electric radii, magnetic moments as well as
axial charges, and in addition a recently derived microscopic description of
the $\pi NN$ as well as $\pi N\Delta$ interaction vertices. Except for hadronic
resonance decays, which are not addressed here due to space limitations, all of
these observables are obtained in good agreement with existing phenomenology.
Relativistic (boost) effects are generally sizable. We conclude that low-energy
hadrons can be well described by an effective theory with a finite number of
degrees of freedom, as long as the symmetries of low-energy quantum
chromodynamics (spontaneously broken chiral symmetry) as well as special
relativity (Poincar\'e invariance) are properly taken into account. The latter
requirement is particularly well and efficiently met in the point-form
approach.

main results: The ultraviolet singular structure of the bulk-to-bulk
propagators for higher spin gauge fields in AdS4 space is analyzed in details.
One loop mass renormalization is studied on a simple example. The conformal
invariant Lagrangian with the k-th power of Laplacian for the hierarchy of
conformally coupled scalars with increasing scaling dimensions connected with
the k-th Euler density is rederived using the Fefferman-Graham ambient space
approach. The corresponding gauged ambient metric, Fefferman- Graham expansion
and extended Penrose-Brown-Henneaux transformations are proposed and analyzed.
Linearized gauge invariant interactions of scalar and general higher even spin
fields in the AdSD space are obtained. A generalized Weyl transformation is
proposed and the corresponding Weyl invariant action for cubic coupling of a
scalar to a spin \ell field is constructed. Using Noether's procedure several
cubic interactions between different HS gauge fields are derived, including
cubic selfinteraction of even spin gauge fields in a flat background. Then the
main result - the complete off-shell gauge invariant Lagrangian for the
trilinear interactions of Higher Spin Fields with arbitrary spins s1, s2, s3 in
a flat background is presented. All possibilities with different numbers of
derivatives are discussed. Restrictions on the number of derivatives are
obtained. For any possible number of derivatives this interaction is uniquely
fixed by gauge invariance up to partial integration and field redefinition.
Finally an off-shell generating function for all cubic interactions of Higher
Spin gauge fields is presented. It is written in a compact way, and turns out
to have a remarkable structure.

  Research""",,,,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Parker instability arises from the presence of magnetic fields in a plasma in
a gravitational field such as the interstellar medium (ISM), wherein the
magnetic buoyant pressure expels the gas and causes the gas to move along the
field lines. The process of mixing of this instability in the ISM near the
Galactic plane is investigated. The initial ISM is assumed to consist of two
fluids: plasma gas and cosmic-ray particles, in hydrostatic equilibrium,
coupled with a uniform, azimuthally-aligned magnetic field. The evolution of
the instability is explored in two models: an isothermal exponential-declining
density model and a two-layered, hyperbolic tangent temperature model. After a
small perturbation, the unstable gas aggregates at the bottom of the magnetic
loops and forms dense blobs. The growth rate of the instability decreases as
the coupling between the cosmic rays and the plasma becomes stronger (meaning a
smaller CR diffusion coefficient). The mixing is enhanced by the cosmic-ray
diffusion, while the shape of the condensed gas depends sensitively on the
initial equilibrium conditions. The hyperbolic tangent temperature model
produces a more concentrated and round shape of clumps at the foot points of
rising magnetic arches, like the observed giant molecular cloud, whereas the
exponential density model gives rise to a filamentary morphology of the clumpy
structure. When considering a minimum perpendicular or cross field diffusion of
cosmic rays, which is often substantially smaller than the parallel coefficient
$\kappa_{\|}$, around $2%-4%$ of $\kappa_{\|}$, the flow speed is significantly
increased such that the magnetic loops extend to a greater altitude. We
speculate that the galactic wind flow perpendicular to the galactic disk may be
facilitated by Parker instabilities through the cross field diffusion of cosmic
rays.

based on feedback proposed by Pao-Lo Liu [ J. Lightwave Techology 27 (2009) pp.
5230-34]. The crack is ultimate and absolute because it works under idealized
conditions, and produces much higher data visibility for the eavesdropper than
the protocol provides for Alice and Bob. Even with the most idealistic driving
noise spectrum stated by Liu, during the most secure phase of the protocol, far
away from the transients, where the system is already in its most secure
steady-state, the eavesdropper has 100% success rate in identifying the key
bits, at the same time when Alice and Bob have less than 100% success rate
while using the Liu protocol. No statistics is needed, Eve can extract the
secure bit from two samples of the signal in the two direction. Thus the
Liu-protocol offers no security against the attack described in this paper.

the point-form of relativistic quantum mechanics. Electromagnetic scattering of
an electron by a 2-body bound state is treated as a 2-channel problem for a
Bakamjian-Thomas-type mass operator. In this way retardation effects in the
photon-exchange interaction are fully taken into account. The electromagnetic
current of the 2-body bound state is then extracted from the
one-photon-exchange optical potential. As an application we calculate
electromagnetic pion and deuteron form factors. Wrong cluster properties,
inherent in the Bakamjian-Thomas framework, are seen to cause spurious
(unphysical) contributions in the current. These are separated and eliminated
in an unambiguous way such that one is left with a current that has all the
desired properties.

of active scalar equations with fractional dissipation. Each component of the
velocity field $u$ is determined by the active scalar $\theta$ through
$\mathcal{R} \Lambda^{-1} P(\Lambda) \theta$ where $\mathcal{R}$ denotes a
Riesz transform, $\Lambda=(-\Delta)^{1/2}$ and $P(\Lambda)$ represents a family
of Fourier multiplier operators. The 2D Navier-Stokes vorticity equations
correspond to the special case $P(\Lambda)=I$ while the surface
quasi-geostrophic (SQG) equation to $P(\Lambda) =\Lambda$. We obtain the global
regularity for a class of equations for which $P(\Lambda)$ and the fractional
power of the dissipative Laplacian are required to satisfy an explicit
condition. In particular, the active scalar equations with any fractional
dissipation and with $P(\Lambda)= (\log(I-\Delta))^\gamma$ for any $\gamma>0$
are globally regular.

diagnosis of melanoma and other pigmented skin lesions. Due to the difficulty
and subjectivity of human interpretation, computerized analysis of dermoscopy
images has become an important research area. One of the most important steps
in dermoscopy image analysis is the automated detection of lesion borders.
Methods: In this article, we present a systematic overview of the recent border
detection methods in the literature paying particular attention to
computational issues and evaluation aspects. Conclusion: Common problems with
the existing approaches include the acquisition, size, and diagnostic
distribution of the test image set, the evaluation of the results, and the
inadequate description of the employed methods. Border determination by
dermatologists appears to depend upon higher-level knowledge, therefore it is
likely that the incorporation of domain knowledge in automated methods will
enable them to perform better, especially in sets of images with a variety of
diagnoses.
