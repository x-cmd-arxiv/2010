deformed Poisson commutation relations, on the evolution of a Bianchi type I
cosmological model with a positive cosmological constant. The phase space
variables turn out to correspond to the scale factors of this model in $x$, $y$
and $z$ directions. According to the conditions that the structure constants
(deformation parameters) should satisfy, we argue that there are two types of
noncommutative phase space with Lie-algebraic structure. The exact classical
solutions in commutative and type I noncommutative cases are presented. In the
framework of this type of deformed phase space, we investigate the possibility
of building a Bianchi I model with cyclic scale factors in which the size of
the universe in each direction experiences an endless sequence of contractions
and re-expansions. We also obtain some approximate solutions for the type II
noncommutative structure by numerical methods and show that the cyclic behavior
is repeated as well. These results are compared with the standard commutative
case, and similarities and differences of these solutions are discussed.

dependent (TMD) parton distribution functions (PDF)s arguing that in the
light-cone gauge the overlapping ultraviolet and rapidity divergences cannot be
solely controlled by (dimensional) regularization, but necessitate their
renormalization. In doing so, we show that at the one-loop order this
additional divergence entails an anomalous dimension which can be attributed to
a cusp in the gauge contour at light-cone infinity. Then, we present a recent
analysis of TMD PDFs which incorporates in the gauge links the Pauli term $\sim
F^{\mu\nu}[\gamma_\mu,\gamma_\nu]$. This generalized treatment of gauge
invariance is shown to be justified, in the sense that it does not modify the
behavior of the leading-twist contribution, though it contributes to the
anomalous dimension of that of twist-three. An important consequence of the
inclusion of the spin-dependent Pauli term is the appearance of a constant
phase---the same for the leading twist-two and subleading distribution
functions---that ensues from the interaction of the Pauli term in the
transverse gauge link with the gauge field accompanying the fermion.
Remarkably, this phase has opposite sign for the Drell-Yan process as compared
to the semi-inclusive DIS.

comprises the most complete optical stellar catalog of the galaxy from imaging
with the Suprime-Cam at the 8.2-m SUBARU Telescope. We identify 47 distinct
star clusters with the application of the nearest-neighbor density method to
this catalog for a detection threshold of 3sigma above the average stellar
density. The size distribution of the detected clusters can be very well
approximated by a Gaussian with a peak at ~ 68 pc. Their cluster mass function
is fitted very well by a power-law with index alpha ~ 1.5 +/- 0.7, consistent
with other Local Group galaxies and the cluster initial mass function. The
application of the nearest-neighbor density method for various density
thresholds, other than 3sigma, enabled the identification of stellar
concentrations in various length-scales. The stellar density maps constructed
with this technique provide a direct proof of hierarchically structured stellar
concentrations in NGC 6822. We illustrate this hierarchy by the so-called
""dendrogram"" of the detected stellar structures, which demonstrates that most
of the detected structures split up into several substructures over at least
three levels. We quantify the hierarchy of these structures with the use of the
minimum spanning tree method. The morphological hierarchy in stellar
clustering, which we observe in NGC 6822 resembles that of the turbulent
interstellar matter, suggesting that turbulence on pc- and kpc-scales has been
probably the major agent that regulated clustered star formation in NGC 6822.

problem defined here. This framework includes the problems: SM-vertex cover;
SM-2SAT; SM-min satisfiability; SM-edge deletion for clique, SM-node deletion
for biclique and others. We also introduce here the submodular closure problem

primordial non-Gaussianity using the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
bispectrum from both the temperature and the polarization anisotropies. For
temperature systematics we consider gain fluctuation and beam distortions. For
polarization we consider effects related to known instrumental systematics:
calibration, pixel rotation, differential gain, pointing, and ellipticity of
the instrument beam. We consider these effects at next to leading order, which
we refer to as non-linear systematic effects. We find that if the instrumental
response is linearly proportional to the received CMB intensity, then only the
shape of the primordial CMB bispectrum, if there is any, will be distorted. We
show that the nonlinear response of the instrument can in general result in
spurious non-Gaussian features on both the CMB temperature and polarization
anisotropies, even if the primordial CMB is completely Gaussian. We determine
the level for both the linear and non-linear systematics parameters for which
they would cause no significant degradation of our ability to constrain the
primordial non-Gaussianity amplitude f_{nl}. We find that the non-linear
systematics are potentially bigger worry for extracting the primordial
non-Gaussianity than the linear systematics. Especially because the current and
near future CMB probes are optimized for CMB power-spectrum measurements which
are not particularly sensitive to the non-linear instrument response. We find
that if instrumental non-linearities are not controlled by dedicated
calibration, the effective local non-Gaussianity can be as large as f_{nl} ~
O(10) before the corresponding non-linearities show up in the CMB dipole
measurements. The higher order multipoles are even less sensitive to
instrumental non-linearities.

oxygen atoms swells the chain molecule globule. This supports the view that the
chain molecule globule might have a secondary effect on the hydrophobic
interaction which is of first interest here. The volume of the chain molecule
globule is important for comparing the probabilities with and without solvent
because it characterizes the local concentration of capping groups. Study of
other capping groups to enable X-ray and neutron diffraction measurements of
P(r) is discussed.

discounted by a riskless asset is considered. The numeraire portfolio is the
unique strictly positive wealth process that, when used as a benchmark to
denominate all other wealth, makes all wealth processes local martingales. It
is assumed that the numeraire portfolio exists and that its wealth increases to
infinity as time goes to infinity. Under this setting, an initial enlargement
of the filtration is performed, by including the overall minimum of the
numeraire portfolio. It is established that all nonnegative wealth processes,
when stopped at the time of the overall minimum of the numeraire portfolio,
become local martingales in the enlarged filtration. This implies that
risk-averse insider traders would refrain from investing in the risky assets
before that time. A partial converse to the previous result is also established
in the case of complete markets, showing that the time of the overall minimum

undesirable the act of undertaking risky positions before it. The

free-free component was measured in 40 of the 42 detections, and the inferred
disk masses range from 0.003-0.07 Msolar. We find that disks located within 0.3
pc of theta^1 Ori C have a truncated mass distribution, while disks located
beyond 0.3 pc have masses more comparable to those found in low-mass star
forming regions. The disk mass distribution in Orion has a distance dependence,
with a derived relationship max(M_(disk)) = 0.046Msolar(d/0.3pc)^0.33 for the
maximum disk masses. We found evidence of grain growth in disk 197-427, the
only disk detected at both 880 microns and 1330 microns with the SMA. Despite
the rapid erosion of the outer parts of the Orion disks by photoevaporation,
the potential for planet formation remains high in this massive star forming

very general) algorithmic procedure for computing the spectrum of physical
scalar fluctuations of the fully back-reacted system. Focusing in particular on
the conditions under which the spectrum of scalar excitations (glueballs)
contains parametrically light states, we apply the formalism to some especially
simple toy models, which can be thought of as the gauge/gravity duals of
strongly-coupled, non-conformal four-dimensional gauge theories. Our examples
are chosen both within the context of phenomenological effective field theory
constructions (bottom-up approach), and within the context of consistent
truncations of ten-dimensional string theories in the supergravity limit
(top-down approach). In one of the examples, a light dilaton is present in the
spectrum in spite of the presence of a bad naked singularity in the deep IR,
near which the RG flow of the dual theory is certainly very far away from any
fixed point. If this feature were to persist in a complete model in which the
singularity is resolved, this would prove that a light dilaton is to be
expected in at least certain walking technicolor theories. We provide here all
the technical details for testing this statement, once such a complete model is

stellar population ages from broadband photometry of high redshift star-forming
galaxies. We use synthetic spectral templates with a variety of simple
parametric star formation histories to fit broadband spectral energy
distributions. These parametric models are used to infer ages, star formation
rates and stellar masses for a mock data set drawn from a hierarchical
semi-analytic model of galaxy evolution. Traditional parametric models
generally assume an exponentially declining rate of star-formation after an
initial instantaneous rise. Our results show that star formation histories with
a much more gradual rise in the star formation rate are likely to be better
templates, and are likely to give better overall estimates of the age
distribution and star formation rate distribution of Lyman break galaxies. For
B- and V-dropouts, we find the best simple parametric model to be one where the
star formation rate increases linearly with time. The exponentially-declining
model overpredicts the age by 100 % and 120 % for B- and V-dropouts, on
average, while for a linearly-increasing model, the age is overpredicted by 9 %
and 16 %, respectively. Similarly, the exponential model underpredicts
star-formation rates by 56 % and 60 %, while the linearly-increasing model
underpredicts by 15 % 22 %, respectively. For U-dropouts, the models where the
star-formation rate has a peak (near z ~ 3) provide the best match for age --
overprediction is reduced from 110 % to 26 % -- and star-formation rate --
underprediction is reduced from 58 % to 22 %. We classify different types of
star-formation histories in the semi-analytic models and show how the biases
behave for the different classes. We also provide two-band calibration formulae

discussion of the Hanle effect for magnetized disks in which the
magnetorotational instability (MRI) is operating is also presented. Given that
the MRI has a tendency to mix the vector field orientation, it may be difficult
to detect the disk fields with the longitudinal Zeeman effect, since the

associated to the vertices, arrows and faces of a quiver, and the concepts of a
connected matrix and boundary matrix are introduced to study the relations
among these derivations, concluding that the space of edge derivations is the
direct sum of the spaces of the vertex derivations and the face derivations,
while the dimensions of the latter spaces are the largest possible. By taking
dimensions, this relation among spaces of derivations recovers Euler's

this paper introduces an asymptotically sum-capacity-achieving

propose a three-stage dirty paper coding strategy, along with receiver

Sun experience an ingestion of protons into the hot core during the core helium
flash phase at the end of their red giant branch evolution. This produces a
concurrent secondary flash powered by hydrogen burning that gives rise to
further nucleosynthesis in the core. We perform post-process nucleosynthesis
calculations on a one-dimensional stellar evolution calculation of a star of 1
solar mass and metallicity [Fe/H] = -6.5 that suffers a proton ingestion
episode. Our network includes 320 nuclear species and 2,366 reactions and
treats mixing and burning simultaneously. The mixing and burning of protons
into the hot convective core leads to the production of 13C, which then burns
via the 13C(alpha,n)16O reaction releasing a large number of free neutrons.
During the first two years of neutron production the neutron poison 14N
abundance is low, allowing the prodigious production of heavy elements such as
strontium, barium, and lead via slow neutron captures (the s process). These
nucleosynthetic products are later mixed to the stellar surface and ejected via
stellar winds. We compare our results with observations of the hyper-metal-poor
halo star HE 1327-2326, which shows a strong Sr overabundance. Our model
provides the possibility of self-consistently explaining the Sr overabundance
in HE 1327-2326 together with its C, N, and O overabundances (all within a
factor of ~4) if the material were heavily diluted, for example, via mass
transfer in a wide binary system. The model produces at least 18 times too much
Ba than observed, but this may be within the large modelling uncertainties. In
this scenario, binary systems of low mass must have formed in the early

which admit interpretations in terms a dual field theory, and compute
properties such as effective potentials and spectra, using both holographic and
field theoretic methods. First, we study the phase structure of beta-deformed
N=4 SYM on S3 at weak and strong 't Hooft coupling. We compute the one-loop
effective potential, and find that at near critical chemical potential and
small finite temperature, there is a metastable state at the origin of moduli
space. We derive the gravitational background describing the theory at strong
coupling, and by performing a probe-brane calculation, we find qualitative
agreement between the weak and strong coupling results. Next, we study
gravitational backgrounds obtained by wrapping Nc D5 color branes on an S2
inside a CY3-fold, and Nf D5 backreacting flavor branes on a non-compact
two-cycle inside the same CY3-fold. These backgrounds are believed to be dual
to certain SQCD-like theories. We compute how the spectrum depends on the
number of flavors, and find that the mass of the lightest scalar glueball
increases with the number of flavors until the point Nf=2Nc is reached after
which the opposite behaviour is observed. Finally, we consider a class of
backgrounds that exhibit walking behaviour, i.e. a suitably defined
four-dimensional gauge coupling stays nearly constant in an intermediate energy
regime. The breaking of approximate scale invariance has been conjectured to
lead to the existence of a light scalar in the spectrum. This so-called dilaton
would be the pseudo-Goldstone boson of dilatations. Using holographic
techniques, we compute the spectrum and find a light state whose mass is
suppressed by the length of the walking region, suggesting that this might be
the dilaton.

nonlinear gravitational responses of gas to, and the resulting drag forces on,
very massive perturbers moving on circular orbits. This work extends our
previous studies that explored the cases of low-mass perturbers on circular
orbits and massive perturbers on straight-line trajectories. The background
medium is assumed to be non-rotating, adiabatic with index 5/3, and uniform
with density rho0 and sound speed a0. We model the gravitating perturber using
a Plummer sphere with mass Mp and softening radius rs in a uniform circular
motion at speed Vp and orbital radius Rp, and run various models with differing
R=rs/Rp, Mach=Vp/a0, and B=G*Mp/(a0^2*Rp). A quasi-steady density wake of a
supersonic model consists of a hydrostatic envelope surrounding the perturber,
an upstream bow shock, and a trailing low-density region. The continuous change
in the direction of the perturber motion makes the detached shock distance
reduced compared to the linear-trajectory cases, while the orbit-averaged
gravity of the perturber gathers the gas toward the center of the orbit,
modifying the background preshock density to rho1=(1 + 0.46B)*rho0 depending
weakly on Mach. For sufficiently massive perturbers, the presence of a
hydrostatic envelope makes the drag force smaller than the prediction of the
linear perturbation theory, resulting in F = 4*pi*rho1*(G*Mp/Vp)^2 * (0.7/etaB)
for etaB = B/(Mach^2 -1) > 0.1; the drag force for low-mass perturbers with
etaB < 0.1 agrees well with the linear prediction. The nonlinear drag force
becomes independent of R as long as R < etaB/2, which places an upper limit on
the perturber size for accurate evaluation of the drag force in numerical
simulations.

cluster are estimated to be 0.76 - 1.00 mag and 6.0 +/- 0.8 kpc, respectively.
Present analysis yields a spectral class of O6.5V for the main ionizing source
of the region. The distribution of YSOs in (J-H)/ (H-K) NIR colour-colour
diagram shows that a majority of them have A_V $\le$ 4 mag. Based on the NIR
excess characteristics, we identified 120 probable candidate YSOs in this
region which yield a disk frequency of ~ 20%. These YSOs are found to have an
age spread of ~ 5 Myr with a median age of ~ 2-3 Myr and a mass range of ~ 0.1
- 3.0 $M_\odot$. A significant number of YSOs are located close to the cluster
centre and we detect an enhanced density of reddened YSOs located/projected
close to the molecular clumps at the periphery of NGC 1624. This indicates that
the YSOs located within the cluster core are relatively older in comparison to
those located/projected near the clumps. From the radio continuum flux,
spectral class of the ionizing source of the ultra-compact H II region at the
periphery of Sh2-212 is estimated to be ~ B0.5V. From optical data, slope of
the mass function (MF) $\Gamma$, in the mass range $1.2 \le M/M_{\odot}<27$ can
be represented by a single power law with a slope -1.18 +/- 0.10, whereas the
NIR data in the mass range $0.65 \le M/M_{\odot}<27$ yields $\Gamma$ = -1.31
+/- 0.15. The slope of the K-band luminosity function (KLF) for the cluster is
found to be 0.30 +/- 0.06 which is in agreement with the values obtained for
other young clusters.

quantum mechanics that may be found in the literature to date. The first
approach, which we will call the contravariant approach, was originally
proposed by Isham and Butterfield, and was later extended by Doering and Isham.
The second approach, which we will call the covariant approach, was developed
by Heunen, Landsman and Spitters. Motivated by coarse-graining and the
Kochen-Specker theorem, the contravariant approach uses the topos of presheaves
on a specific context category, defined as the poset of commutative von Neumann
subalgebras of some given von Neumann algebra. In particular, the approach uses
the spectral presheaf. The intuitionistic logic of this approach is given by
the (complete) Heyting algebra of closed open subob jects of the spectral
presheaf. We show that this Heyting algebra is, in a natural way, a locale in
the ambient topos, and compare this locale with the internal Gelfand spectrum
of the covariant approach. In the covariant approach, a non-commutative
C*-algebra (in the topos Set) defines a commutative C*-algebra internal to the
topos of covariant functors from the context category to the category of sets.
We give an explicit description of the internal Gelfand spectrum of this
commutative C*-algebra, from which it follows that the external spectrum is
spatial. Using the daseinisation of self-adjoint operators from the
contravariant approach, we give a new definition of the daseinisation arrow in
the covariant approach and compare it with the original version. States and
state-proposition pairing in both approaches are compared. We also investigate
the physical interpretation of the covariant approach.

regularity condition and a certain rather technical curvature bound. The
regularity condition is conjectured to be always satisfied, while the curvature
bound has recently been shown to fail in some concrete examples. As a step
towards a better understanding of its meaning, we discuss several equivalent
formulations of the curvature bound condition and also a very natural
technically simpler condition which turns out to be stronger. These
reformulations show that the validity this condition does not depend on the
choice of the open set and the constant $R$ appearing in the condition and
allow to discuss some concrete examples of self-similar sets. In particular, it
is shown that the class of sets satisfying the curvature bound condition is
strictly larger than the class of sets satisfying the assumption of
polyconvexity used in earlier results.

that inferred from optical (rest frame UV) as measured along gamma-ray burst

optical absorption line spectroscopy. We explore this ""missing gas problem"" by
using X-ray and optical measurements in a sample of 29 z=0.7-6.3 GRBs from both
spectroscopic data and the afterglow broadband spectral energy distributions.
The low ionisation species detected in the UV are associated with the neutral
interstellar medium in the GRB host galaxy, while soft X-ray absorption, which
is weakly dependent on the ionisation state of the gas, provides a probe of the
total column of gas along the sight line. After careful consideration of any
systematic effects, we find that the neutral gas consists of less than ~10% of
the total gas, and this limit decreases with the more ionised that the X-ray
absorbing gas is, which in our spectral fits is assumed to be neutral. Only a
very small fraction of this ionised gas, however, is detected in UV absorption
lines with ionisation potentials up to ~200eV (i.e. SiIV, CIV, NV, OVI), which
leaves us to postulate that the X-ray excess is due to ultra-highly-ionised,
dense gas in the GRB vicinity.

theta between the disc axis and the line of sight. Based on this, the
equivalent width (EW) of [OIII] should provide a direct measure of theta. Here
we analyze the distribution of EW([OIII]) in a sample of ~6,000 SDSS quasars,
and find that it can be accurately reproduced assuming a relatively small
intrinsic scatter and a random distribution of inclination angles. This result
has several implications: 1) it is a direct proof of the disc-like emission of
the optical continuum of quasars; 2) the value of EW([OIII]) can be used as a
proxy of the inclination, to correct the measured continuum emission and then
estimate the bolometric luminosity of quasars; 3) the presence of almost
edge-on discs among broad line quasars implies that the accretion disc is not
aligned with the circumnuclear absorber, and/or that the covering fraction of
the latter is rather small. Finally, we show that a similar analysis of EW
distributions of broad lines (Hbeta, Mg II, C IV) provides no evidence of
inclination effects, suggesting a disc-like geometry of the broad emission line
region.

video illustrates the complexity of the interaction between a Mach 2.3
supersonic turbulent boundary layer and an oblique shock wave generated by a
8-degree wedge angle. The first part of the video highlights the propagation of
disturbances along the reflected shock due to the direct perturbation of the
shock foot by turbulence structures from the upstream boundary layer. The
second part of the video describes the observed block-like back-and-forth
motions of the reflected shock, focusing on timescales about two orders of
magnitude longer than the ones shown in the first part of video. This gives a
visual impression of the broadband and energetically-significant peak in the
wall-pressure spectrum at low frequencies. The background blue-white colouring
represents the temperature field (with white corresponding to hot) and one can
clearly appreciate why such low-frequency shock motions can lead to reduced
fatigue lifetimes and is detrimental to aeronautical applications.

The first, inspired by Gelfand duality, states that the category of
'noncommutative spaces' is the opposite of the category of C*-algebras. The
second, loosely generalizing Stone duality, maintains that the category of
'pointfree spaces' is the opposite of the category of frames (i.e., complete
lattices in which the meet distributes over arbitrary joins). One possible
relationship between these two notions of space was unearthed by Banaschewski
and Mulvey, who proved a constructive version of Gelfand duality in which the
Gelfand spectrum of a commutative C*-algebra comes out as a pointfree space.
Being constructive, this result applies in arbitrary toposes (with natural
numbers objects, so that internal C*-algebras can be defined). Earlier work by
the first three authors, shows how a noncommutative C*-algebra gives rise to a
commutative one internal to a certain sheaf topos. The latter, then, has a
constructive Gelfand spectrum, also internal to the topos in question. After a
brief review of this work, we compute the so-called external description of
this internal spectrum, which in principle is a fibered pointfree space in the
familiar topos Sets of sets and functions. However, we obtain the external
spectrum as a fibered topological space in the usual sense. This leads to an
explicit Gelfand transform, as well as to a topological reinterpretation of the
Kochen-Specker Theorem of quantum mechanics, which supplements the remarkable
topos-theoretic version of this theorem due to Butterfield and Isham.

X as a set of 'microstates', and treat any function on X as an 'observable'.
For any collection of observables, we can study the Gibbs ensemble that
maximizes entropy subject to constraints on expected values of these
observables. We illustrate this by taking the log runtime, length, and output
of a program as observables analogous to the energy E, volume V and number of
molecules N in a container of gas. The conjugate variables of these observables
allow us to define quantities which we call the 'algorithmic temperature' T,
'algorithmic pressure' P and algorithmic potential' mu, since they are
analogous to the temperature, pressure and chemical potential. We derive an
analogue of the fundamental thermodynamic relation dE = T dS - P d V + mu dN,
and use it to study thermodynamic cycles analogous to those for heat engines.
We also investigate the values of T, P and mu for which the partition function
converges. At some points on the boundary of this domain of convergence, the
partition function becomes uncomputable. Indeed, at these points the partition
function itself has nontrivial algorithmic entropy.

of the black brane equilibrium states and derive the phase structures. For the
zero charge case we find an analog of Hawking-Page phase transition for these
black branes in arbitrary dimensions. When the charge is non-zero, we find that
below a critical value of the charge, the phase diagram has a line of
first-order phase transition in a certain range of temperatures which ends up
at a second order phase transition point (critical point) as the charge attains
the critical value. We calculate the critical exponents at that critical point.
Although our discussion is mainly concerned with the non-dilatonic branes, we
show how it easily carries over to the dilatonic branes as well.

We find that this longevity of the spiral arms is mainly due to the phenomenon
of stickiness of chaotic orbits close to the unstable asymptotic manifolds
originated from the main unstable periodic orbits, both inside and outside
corotation. The stickiness along the manifolds corresponding to different
energy levels supports parts of the spiral structure. The loci of the disc
velocity minima (where the particles spend most of their time, in the

morphological structures of the system. We study the relation of these loci

diffusion of the sticky chaotic orbits outwards is slow and depends on the

tens of Rg, rather than within <6Rg of the black hole. Results obtained with

intrinsic absorption (NH) and thus the intrinsic luminosity. To this end we

present here the results of this broad-band (0.4-100 keV) spectral analysis. We
found that the broad-band X-ray emission of IRAS 04507+0358 requires a large
amount of absorption (larger than 1e24 cm^-2) to be well reproduced, thus
confirming the Compton-thick nature of this source. In particular, the most

spectra of five photospheric lines with a model that mimicked vertically
interlaced magnetic fields with two components, labeled background field and
flow channels. The flow channels were modeled as a perturbation of the
background field with a Gaussian shape using the SIRGAUS code. The location and
extension of the Gaussian perturbation in the optical depth scale was then
converted to a geometrical height scale. I investigated the relative amount of
magnetic flux in the flow channels and the background field atmosphere. The
uncombed model is able to reproduce the NCP well on the limb side of the spot
and worse on the center side; the VIS lines are better reproduced than the
near-IR lines. The Evershed flow happens along nearly horizontal field lines
close to the solar surface. The magnetic flux that is related to the flow
channels makes up about 20-50% of the total magnetic flux in the penumbra. The
gradients obtainable by a Gaussian perturbation are too small for a perfect
reproduction of the NCP in the IR lines with their small formation height
range. Two peculiarities of the observed NCP, a sign change of the NCP of the
VIS lines on the center side and a ring structure around the umbra in the Ti
line at 630.37nm and the FeI line at 1565.2nm deserve closer attention. The
large fraction of magnetic flux related to the flow channel component could

another, is an important limiting case in evolutionary biology. Recently it has
been introduced into evolutionary game theory. In evolutionary game dynamics,
the probability to be imitated or to reproduce depends on the performance in a
game. The influence of the game on the stochastic dynamics in finite
populations is governed by the intensity of selection. In many models of both
unstructured and structured populations, a key assumption allowing analytical
calculations is weak selection, which means that all individuals perform
approximately equally well. In the weak selection limit many different
microscopic evolutionary models have the same or similar properties. How
universal is weak selection for those microscopic evolutionary processes? We
answer this question by investigating the fixation probability and the average
fixation time not only up to linear, but also up to higher orders in selection
intensity. We find universal higher order expansions, which allow a rescaling
of the selection intensity. With this, we can identify specific models which
violate (linear) weak selection results, such as the one--third rule of
coordination games in finite but large populations.

sources, we propose to use correlation measurements at a quantum point contact
with the different sources connected via chiral edge states to the two inputs.
In particular we consider the case of an on-demand single-electron emitter
correlated with the carriers incident from a biased normal reservoir, a contact
subject to an alternating voltage and a stochastic single electron emitter. The
correlation can be viewed as a spectroscopic tool to compare the states of
injected particles of different sources. If at the quantum point contact the
amplitude profiles of electrons overlap, the noise correlation is suppressed.
In the absence of an overlap the noise is roughly the sum of the noise powers
due to the electron streams in each input. We show that the electron state
emitted from a (dc or ac) biased metallic contact is different from a
Lorentzian amplitude electron state emitted by the single electron emitter (a
quantum capacitor driven with slow harmonic potential), since with these inputs
the noise correlation is not suppressed. In contrast, if quantized voltage
pulses are applied to a metallic contact instead of a dc (ac) bias then the
noise can be suppressed. We find a noise suppression for multi-electron pulses
and for the case of stochastic electron emitters for which the appearance of an
electron at the quantum point contact is probabilistic.

components of a binary fluid mixture, with the `self' component having only one
particle, the `distinct' component consisting of all the other particles, and
using DDFT to calculate the time evolution of the density profiles for the two
components. We apply this approach to a bulk fluid of Brownian hard spheres and
compare to results for the van Hove function and the intermediate scattering
function from Brownian dynamics computer simulations. We find good agreement at
low and intermediate densities using the very simple Ramakrishnan-Yussouff
[Phys. Rev. B 19, 2775 (1979)] approximation for the excess free energy
functional. Since the DDFT is based on the equilibrium Helmholtz free energy
functional, we can probe a free energy landscape that underlies the dynamics.
Within the mean-field approximation we find that as the particle density
increases, this landscape develops a minimum, while an exact treatment of a
model confined situation shows that for an ergodic fluid this landscape should
be monotonic. We discuss possible implications for slow, glassy and arrested

on the perturbations that the walls of expanding bubbles originate in the
plasma. Several of the formation mechanisms occur when bubbles collide and lose
their spherical symmetry. However, spherical bubbles are often considered in
the literature, in particular for the calculation of gravitational waves. We
study the steady state motion of bubble walls for different bubble symmetries.
Using the bag equation of state, we discuss the propagation of phase transition
fronts as detonations and subsonic or supersonic deflagrations. We consider the
cases of spherical, cylindrical and planar walls, and compare the energy
transferred to bulk motions of the relativistic fluid. We find that the
different wall geometries give similar perturbations of the plasma. For the
case of planar walls, we obtain analytical expressions for the kinetic energy
in the bulk motions. As an application, we discuss the generation of
gravitational waves.

the LBV star GR290 (Romano's Star) in M33 in order to investigate possible
links between the LBV and WNL stages of very massive stars. We use intermediate
resolution spectra, obtained with WHT in December 2008, when GR290 was at
minimum (V = 18.6), as well as new low resolution spectra and B V R I
photometry obtained with the Loiano and Cima Ekar telescopes during 2007-2010.
We identify more than 80 emission lines in the 3100-10000 A range, belonging to
different species and to forbidden transitions. Many lines, especially the HeI
triplets, show a P Cygni profile with an a-e radial velocity difference from
-300 to -500 km/s. The shape of the 4630-4713 A emission blend and of other
emission lines resembles that of WN9 stars; the blend deconvolution shows that
the HeII 4686 A has a strong broad component with FWHM \simeq 1700 km/s. During
2003-2010 the star underwent large spectral variations, best seen in the
4630-4686 A emission feature. Using the late-WN spectral types of Crowther &
Smith (1997), GR290 apparently varied between the WN11 and WN8-9 spectral
types, the hotter being the star the fainter its visual magnitude. This
spectrum-visual luminosity anticorrelation of GR290 is reminiscent of the
behaviour of the best studied LBVs. During the 2008 minimum we find a
significant decrease in bolometric luminosity, which could be attributed to
absorption by newly formed circumstellar matter. We suggest that, presently,
the broad 4686 A line and the optical continuum are formed in a central WR
region, while the narrow emission line spectrum originate in an extended,
slowly expanding envelope, that is composed by matter ejected during previous
high luminosity phases, and ionized by the central nucleus. GR290 could have
just entered in a phase preceeding the transition from the LBV state to late WN
type.

comparison to traditional learning, this type of learning relies on

principal actors of their learning. These trainings rest on rich and complex
organizations, particularly for tutors, and it is difficult to apply innovative
educational strategies. Our aim, in a bottom-up approach, is (1) to observe,
according to Knowledge Management methods, a course characterized by these
three criteria. The observed course concerns project management learning. Its
observation allows us (2) to highlight and to analyze the problems encountered
by the actors (students, tutors, designers) and (3) to propose tools to solve

wavelengths of electromagnetic waves to change as they propagate, and do so
even in otherwise field-free space. This produces an ambiguity in
interpretations of stellar red shifts. Experiments that will determine the
value of the group parameter, and thereby remove the ambiguity, are proposed.
They are based on an analysis of the anomalous frequency shifts uncovered in
the Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft studies, and physical interpretation of an
isomorphism discovered by E. L. Hill. If the group parameter is found to be
non-zero, Hubble's relations will have to be reinterpreted and space-time
metrics will have to be altered. The cosmological consequences of the
transformations are even more extensive because, though they change
frequencies, they do not alter the energy and momentum conservations laws of
classical and quantum-electrodynamical fields established by Cunningham and by
Bialynicki-Birula.

We consider the situation where it is of interest to estimate an average

analysis and to interpolate between covariance matrices. There are many choices
of metric available, each with its advantages. The particular choice of what is
best will depend on the particular application. The use of the Procrustes
size-and-shape metric is particularly appropriate when the covariance matrices
are close to being deficient in rank. We discuss the use of different metrics
for diffusion tensor analysis, and we also introduce certain types of
regularization for tensors.
