resistance minima and transverse resistance plateaus are seen corresponding to

physical model and an optimization algorithm for analysis, we measure the 10
unique nearest-neighbor base-pair free energies with 0.1 kcal mol-1 precision
over two orders of magnitude of monovalent salt concentration. We find an
improved set of standard energy values compared with Unified Oligonucleotide

latter are found to be strongest for AA/TT and weakest for CC/GG. Our new
energy values and salt corrections improve predictions of DNA unzipping forces
and are fully compatible with melting temperatures for oligos. The method
should make it possible to obtain free energies, enthalpies and entropies in
conditions not accessible by bulk methodologies.

  instabilities:Oblique shock","25 pages,6 figures",,,,"physics.plasm-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","  The nonlinear evolution of two fluid interfacial structures like bubbles and
spikes arising due to the combined action of Rayleigh-Taylor and
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability or due to that of Richtmyer-Meshkov and
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability resulting from oblique shock is investigated.
Using Layzer's model analytic expressions for the asymptotic value of the
combined growth rate are obtained in both cases for spikes and bubbles.
However, if the overlying fluid is of lower density the interface perturbation
behaves in different ways. Depending on the magnitude of the velocity shear
associated with Kelvin-Helmholtz instability both the bubble and spike
amplitude may simultaneously grow monotonically (instability) or oscillate with
time or it may so happen that while this spike steepens the bubble tends to
undulate. In case of an oblique shock which causes combined action of
Richtmyer-Meshkov instability arising due to the normal component of the shock
and Kelvin Helmholtz instability through creation of velocity shear at the two
fluid interface due to its parallel component, the instability growth
rate-instead of behaving as $1/t$ as $t \rightarrow \infty$ for normal shock,
tends asymptotically to a spike peak height growth velocity $\sim
\sqrt{\frac{5(1+A_{T})}{16(1-A_{T})}(\Delta v)^2}$ where $\Delta v $ is the
velocity shear and $A_T$ is the Atwood number. Implication of such result in
connection with generation of spiky fluid jets in astrophysical context is
discussed.

homogeneous approximations to interaction, growth and death. More recently,
spatial interaction and dispersal have also been considered. While these leads
to certain changes in community dynamics, their effect is sometimes fairly
minimal, and demographic scenarios in which this difference is important have
not been systematically investigated.
  We take a simple mean-field model which simulates birth, growth and death
processes, and rewrite it with spatially distributed discrete individuals. Each
individual's growth and mortality is determined by a competition measure which
captures the effects of neighbours in a way which retains the conceptual
simplicity of a generic, analytically-solvable model. Although the model is
generic, we here parameterise it using data from Caledonian Scots Pine stands.
The dynamics of simulated populations, starting from a plantation lattice
configuration, mirror those of well-established qualitative descriptions of
natural forest stand behaviour; an analogy which assists in understanding the
transition from artificial to old-growth structure.
  When parameterised for Scots Pine populations, the signature of spatial
processes is evident, but they do not have a large effect on first-order
statistics such as density and biomass. The sensitivity of this result to
variation in each individual rate parameter is investigated; distinct
differences between spatial and mean-field models are seen only upon alteration
of the interaction strength parameters, and in low density populations. Under
the Scots Pine parameterisation, dispersal also has an effect of spatial
structure, but not first-order properties. Only in more intense competitive
scenarios does altering the relative scales of dispersal and interaction lead
to a clear signal in first order behaviour.

whether a quantum computer can solve NP-complete problems more efficiently than

2001) proposed the adiabatic quantum optimization (AQO), a paradigm that
directly attacks NP-hard optimization problems. How powerful is AQO? Early on,
van Dam and Vazirani claimed that AQO failed (i.e. would take exponential time)

failed also for random instances of the NP-complete Exact Cover problem. In
this paper, we make clear that all these negative results are only for a
specific AQO algorithm. We do so by demonstrating different AQO algorithms for

of a luminous (L_{IR}\approx 4.6x10^43 erg/s) and extended component of
infrared dust emission, not connected with the main bodies of the galaxies, but
roughly coincident with the X-ray halo of the group. We fitted the inferred
dust emission spectral energy distribution of this extended source and the
other main infrared emission components of SQ, including the intergalactic
shock, to elucidate the mechanisms powering the dust and PAH emission, taking
into account collisional heating by the plasma and heating through UV and
optical photons. Combining the inferred direct and dust-processed UV emission
to estimate the star formation rate (SFR) for each source we obtain a total SFR
for SQ of 7.5 M(sun)/yr, similar to that expected for non-interacting galaxies
with stellar mass comparable to the SQ galaxies. Although star formation in SQ
is mainly occurring at, or external to the periphery of the galaxies, the
relation of SFR per unit physical area to gas column density for the brightest
sources is similar to that seen for star-formation regions in galactic disks.
We also show that available sources of dust in the group halo can provide
enough dust to produce up to L_{IR}\approx 10^42 erg/s powered by collisional
heating. Though a minority of the total infrared emission (which we infer to
trace distributed star-formation), this is several times higher than the X-ray
luminosity of the halo, so could indicate an important cooling mechanism for
the hot IGM and account for the overall correspondence between FIR and X-ray
emission.

as in stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP), wherein the pulse coupling
the intermediate state to the continuum precedes and partly overlaps the pulse
coupling the initial and intermediate states, greatly increases the ionization
signal and strongly reduces the population loss due to spontaneous emission
through the lossy state. For strong spontaneous emission from that state,
however, the ionization is never complete because the dark state required for
STIRAP does not exist. We demonstrate that this drawback can be eliminated
almost completely by creating a laser-induced continuum structure (LICS) by
embedding a third discrete state into the continuum with a third control laser.
This LICS introduces some coherence into the continuum, which enables a
STIRAP-like population transfer into the continuum. A highly accurate analytic
description is developed and numerical results are presented for Gaussian pulse

radius of ~500 kpc, ten of which are spectroscopically confirmed cluster
members. Sixteen galaxies are identified as excess line-emitters. Among just
the excess line-emitting galaxies we find an average SFR of 3.6 +/- 1.3

between H broad-band magnitude and SFR such that brighter galaxies have lower
SFRs. The probability that SFR and magnitude of confirmed members are
uncorrelated is 0.7%. We also find a correlation between SFR and distance from
the cluster centre for both confirmed and excess line-emitting candidate
members, with a probability of 5% for there to be no correlation among
confirmed members. All excess line-emitting candidate cluster members are

cross-correlating narrow strips of data from line-of-sight magnetograms
obtained at a 96-minute cadence by the MDI instrument on the ESA/NASA SOHO
spacecraft and then averaging the flow measurements over each synodic rotation
of the Sun. Our measurements indicate that the axisymmetric flows vary
systematically over the solar cycle. The differential rotation is weaker at
maximum than at minimum. The meridional flow is faster at minimum and slower at
maximum. The meridional flow speed on the approach to the Cycle 23/24 minimum
was substantially faster than it was at the Cycle 22/23 minimum. The average
latitudinal profile is largely a simple sinusoid that extends to the poles and
peaks at about $35\degr$ latitude. As the cycle progresses a pattern of
in-flows toward the sunspot zones develops and moves equatorward in step with
the sunspot zones. These in-flows are accompanied by the torsional
oscillations. This association is consistent with the effects of the Coriolis
force acting on the in-flows. The equatorward motions associated with these
in-flows are identified as the source of the decrease in net poleward flow at
cycle maxima. We also find polar counter-cells (equatorward flow at high
latitudes) in the south from 1996 to 2000 and in the north from 2002 to 2010.
We show that these measurements of the flows are not affected by the
non-axisymmetric diffusive motions produced by supergranulation.

all galaxies show a negative metallicity gradient from the center out, with an
average value of Delta[Z/H]/Delta(log(r/Re)) = -0.6. An age increase, decrease,

14 out of 59 galaxies, the light-weighted age of the outer region is greater

have younger light-weighted ages and lower light-weighted metallicities. This
mass-metallicity relation extends into the outer regions of our S0 galaxies.
Our results are consistent with the formation of S0 galaxies through the
transformation of spiral galaxy disks. Determining the structural component

rotationally affected convection play a key role in determining differential
rotation of stars. Here we perform a systematic comparison between Cartesian
and spherical geometries as a function of the rotation rate. Aims. We extend
the earlier studies by using spherical wedges to obtain turbulent angular
momentum and heat transport as functions of the rotation rate from stratified
convection. We compare results from spherical and Cartesian models in the same
parameter regime. In particular, we want to clarify whether the sharp
equatorial profile of the horizontal Reynolds stress found in earlier Cartesian
models is reproduced in spherical models. Methods. We employ direct numerical
simulations of turbulent convection. In order to reach as high spatial
resolution as possible in the spherical runs, we model only parts of the
latitude and longitude. The rotational influence, measured by the Coriolis
number, is varied from zero to roughly seven, which is the regime that is
likely to be realised in the solar convection zone. Cartesian simulations are
performed in overlapping parameter regimes. Results. For slow rotation we find
that the radial and latitudinal turbulent angular momentum fluxes are directed
inward and equatorward, respectively. In the rapid rotation regime the radial
flux changes sign in contradiction with theory. The latitudinal flux remains
mostly equatorward and develops a maximum close to the equator. In Cartesian
simulations this peak can be explained by the strong `banana cells'. The
latitudinal heat flux is mostly equatorward for slow rotation but changes sign
for rapid rotation. The rotation profiles vary from anti-solar (slow equator)
for slow and intermediate rotation to solar-like (fast equator) for rapid
rotation. The solar-like profiles are dominated by the Taylor--Proudman
balance.

Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling as a means to derive realizations of the

computationally expensive, this approach allows us to exactly construct the
full target posterior probability distribution. When compared to the
frequentist estimator, applying the Bayesian method to Gaussian CMB maps
provides consistent results. For the analysis of non-Gaussian maps, however,
the error bars on f_nl do not show excess variance within the Bayesian
framework. This finding is of particular relevance in the light of upcoming

analogues of the Held-Suarez test for tidally-locked exoplanets with the
GFDL-Princeton Flexible Modeling System (FMS) by subjecting both the spectral
and finite difference dynamical cores to a suite of tests, including the
standard benchmark for Earth, a hypothetical tidally-locked Earth, a ""shallow""

quantitative agreement between the solvers for the Earth, tidally-locked Earth
and shallow hot Jupiter benchmarks, but the agreement is less than satisfactory
for the deep model of HD 209458b. Further investigation reveals that closer
agreement may be attained by arbitrarily adjusting the values of the horizontal
dissipation parameters in the two solvers, but it remains the case that the
magnitude of the horizontal dissipation is not easily specified from first
principles. Irrespective of radiative transfer or chemical composition
considerations, our study points to limitations in our ability to accurately
model hot Jupiter atmospheres with meteorological solvers at the level of ten
percent for the temperature field and several tens of percent for the velocity

spacetime in a relaxed sense as compared with the one of Brown and Henneaux.
Nevertheless, the asymptotic symmetry group remains to be the conformal group,

implemented in the Fortran90 version. We also present performance comparisons
of a single CPU plus GPU unit with the S2HAT code running on either a single or
4 processors. In particular we find that use of the latest generation of GPUs,
such as NVIDIA GF100 (Fermi), can accelerate the spherical harmonic transforms
by as much as 18 times with respect to S2HAT executed on one core, and by as
much as 5.5 with respect to S2HAT on 4 cores, with the overall performance
being limited by the Fast Fourier transforms. The work presented here has been
performed in the context of the Cosmic Microwave Background simulations and
analysis. However, we expect that the developed software will be of more
general interest and applicability.

L_tot < 10^5 L_sun) to empirically constrain the formation process of the first
galaxies. Since UFDs have much simpler star formation histories than the halo
of the Milky Way, their stellar populations should preserve the fossil record
of the first supernova (SN) explosions in their long-lived, low-mass stars.
Guided by recent hydrodynamical simulations of first galaxy formation, we
develop a set of stellar abundance signatures that characterize the
nucleosynthetic history of such an early system if it was observed in the
present-day universe. Specifically, we argue that the first galaxies are the
product of chemical ""one-shot"" events, where only one (long-lived) stellar
generation forms after the first, Population III, SN explosions. Our abundance
criteria thus constrain the strength of negative feedback effects inside the
first galaxies. We compare the stellar content of UFDs with these one-shot
criteria. Several systems (Ursa Major II, and also Coma Berenices, Bootes I,
Leo IV, Segue 1) largely fulfill the requirements, indicating that their
high-redshift predecessors did experience strong feedback effects that shut off
star formation. We term the study of the entire stellar population of a dwarf
galaxy for the purpose of inferring details about the nature and origin of the
first galaxies ""dwarf galaxy archaeology"". This will provide clues to the
connection of the first galaxies, the surviving, metal-poor dwarf galaxies, and
the building blocks of the Milky Way.

gravitationally-unstable, gas-rich disks in the early Universe are fuelled by
cold, dense accreting gas flowing along cosmic filaments and penetrating hot
galactic gas halos. However these accreting flows have not been observed, and
cosmic accretion cannot power the observed level of turbulence. Here we report
on a new sample of rare high-velocity-dispersion disk galaxies we have
discovered in the nearby Universe where cold accretion is unlikely to drive
their high star-formation rates. We find that the velocity dispersion is most
fundamentally correlated with their star-formation rates, and not their mass

the energetic driver of galaxy disk turbulence at all cosmic epochs.

to yield a high speed and accurate likelihood computation, using grid

characterise the strength of parameter covariance in Sersic model, which
increases with S/N and $n$, and the results strongly motivate the need for the
full posterior probability distribution in galaxy morphology analyses and later
inferences.
  The test results for simulated galaxies successfully demonstrate that, with a

large extinction (A_V \approx 3.4 mag) of starlight from a stellar component

luminosity of the host galaxy, and therefore the star-formation activity likely
dominates the submillimeter emission. It is possible that SSA22-AzTEC1 is the
first example of a protoquasar growing at the bottom of the gravitational
potential underlying the SSA22 protocluster.

the effective interaction between them is induced by the projection of the

nonclassical correlations which he dramatized using a parable about a seer who
sets an impossible prediction task to his daughter's suitors. We revisit this
example here, using it as an entree to three central concepts in quantum
foundations: contextuality, Bell-nonlocality, and complementarity.
Specifically, we show that Specker's parable offers a narrative thread that
weaves together a large number of results, including: the impossibility of
measurement-noncontextual and outcome-deterministic ontological models of
quantum theory (the Kochen-Specker theorem), in particular the proof of
Klyachko; the impossibility of Bell-local models of quantum theory (Bell's
theorem), especially the proofs by Mermin and Hardy; the impossibility of a
preparation-noncontextual ontological model of quantum theory; and the
existence of triples of positive operator valued measures (POVMs) that can be
measured jointly pairwise but not triplewise. Along the way, several novel
results are presented, including: a generalization of a theorem by Fine
connecting the existence of a joint distribution over outcomes of
counterfactual measurements to the existence of a noncontextual model; a
generalization of Klyachko's proof of the Kochen-Specker theorem; a proof of
the Kochen-Specker theorem in the style of Hardy's proof of Bell's theorem; a
categorization of contextual and Bell-nonlocal correlations in terms of
frustrated networks; a new inequality testing preparation noncontextuality; and
lastly, some results on the joint measurability of POVMs and the question of
whether these can be modeled noncontextually. Finally, we emphasize that
Specker's parable provides a novel type of foil to quantum theory, challenging
us to explain why the particular sort of contextuality and complementarity
embodied therein does not arise in a quantum world.

total VLBI flux density of Sgr\,A* varies from day to day. The variability is
correlated at the 3 observing frequencies with higher variability amplitudes
appearing at the higher frequencies. For the modulation indices, we find 8.4\,%

inverted between 22 and 86\,GHz, suggesting inhomogeneous synchrotron
self-absorption with a turnover frequency at or above 86\,GHz. The radio
spectral index correlates with the flux density, which is harder (more inverted
spectrum) when the source is brighter. The average source size does not appear
to be variable over the 10-day observing interval. However, we see a tendency
for the sizes of the minor axis to increase with increasing total flux, whereas
the major axis remains constant. Towards higher frequencies, the position angle
of the elliptical Gaussian increases, indicative of intrinsic structure, which
begins to dominate the scatter broadening. At cm-wavelength, the source size
varies with wavelength as $\lambda^{2.12\pm0.12}$, which is interpreted as the
result of interstellar scatter broadening. After removal of this scatter
broadening, the intrinsic source size varies as $\lambda^{1.4 ... 1.5}$. The
VLBI closure phases at 22, 43, and 86\,GHz are zero within a few degrees,
indicating a symmetric or point-like source structure. In the context of an
expanding plasmon model, we obtain an upper limit of the expansion velocity of
about 0.1\,c from the non-variable VLBI structure. This agrees with the

Sandeep Pradhan","Error Exponent for Multiple-Access Channels:Lower Bounds","46 pages, 2 figures",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A unified framework to obtain all known lower bounds (random coding, typical
random coding and expurgated bound) on the reliability function of a
point-to-point discrete memoryless channel (DMC) is presented. By using a
similar idea for a two-user discrete memoryless (DM) multiple-access channel
(MAC), three lower bounds on the reliability function are derived. The first
one (random coding) is identical to the best known lower bound on the
reliability function of DM-MAC. It is shown that the random coding bound is the
performance of the average code in the constant composition code ensemble. The
second bound (Typical random coding) is the typical performance of the constant
composition code ensemble. To derive the third bound (expurgated), we eliminate
some of the codewords from the codebook with larger rate. This is the first
bound of this type that explicitly uses the method of expurgation for MACs. It
is shown that the exponent of the typical random coding and the expurgated
bounds are greater than or equal to the exponent of the known random coding
bounds for all rate pairs. Moreover, an example is given where the exponent of
the expurgated bound is strictly larger. All these bounds can be universally
obtained for all discrete memoryless MACs with given input and output
alphabets.

produce radioactive nuclei. When stable nuclei are irradiated by a flux of
protons or neutrons, capture reactions push stable matter out of stability into
the regime of unstable species. The ongoing production of radioactive nuclei in
the deep interior of the Sun via proton-capture reactions is recorded by
neutrinos emitted during radioactive decay and detected on Earth. Radioactive
nuclei that have relatively long half lives may also be detected in stars via
spectroscopic observations and in stardust recovered from primitive meteorites
via laboratory analysis. The vast majority of these stardust grains originated
from Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars. This is the final phase in the
evolution of stars initially less massive than ~10 solar masses, during which
nuclear energy is produced by alternate hydrogen and helium burning in shells
above the core. The long-lived radioactive nucleus 26Al is produced in massive
AGB stars (>4:5 solar masses), where the base of the convective envelope
reaches high temperatures. Several other long-lived radioactive nuclei,
including 60Fe, 87Rb, and 99Tc, are produced in AGB stars when matter is
exposed to a significant neutron flux leading to the synthesis of elements
heavier than iron. Here, neutron captures occur on a timescale that is
typically slower than beta-decay timescales, resulting slow neutron captures
(the s-process). However, when radioactive nuclei with half lives greater than
a few days are produced they may either decay or capture a neutron, thus
branching up the path of neutron captures and defining the final s-process
abundance distribution. This nucleosynthesis in AGB stars could produce some
long-living radioactive nuclei in relative abundances that resemble those
observed in the early solar system.

matrices and their permutations, using certain entries in their primitive
idempotents. Our main result is summarized as follows. Let $d$ denote a
nonnegative integer. Let $A$ denote a matrix in $\matR$ and let
$\{\th_i\}_{i=0}^d$ denote the roots of the characteristic polynomial of $A$.
We say $A$ is multiplicity-free whenever these roots are mutually distinct and
contained in $\R$. In this case $E_i$ will denote the primitive idempotent of
$A$ associated with $\th_i$ $(0 \leq i \leq d)$. We say $A$ is symmetrizable
whenever there exists an invertible diagonal matrix $\Delta \in \matR$ such
that $\Delta A \Delta^{-1}$ is symmetric. Let $\Gamma(A)$ denote the directed
graph with vertex set $\{0,1,...,d\}$, where $i \rightarrow j$ whenever $i \neq
j$ and $A_{ij} \neq 0$. Theorem: Assume that each entry of $A$ is nonnegative.
Then the following are equivalent for $0 \leq s,t \leq d$: (i) The graph
$\Gamma(A)$ is a bidirected path with endpoints $s$, $t$: (ii) The matrix $A$

times $(\th_i-\th_0)...(\th_i-\th_{i-1})(\th_i-\th_{i+1})...(\th_i-\th_d)$ is
independent of $i$ for $0 \leq i \leq d$, and this common value is nonzero.
Recently Kurihara and Nozaki obtained a theorem that characterizes the
$Q$-polynomial property for symmetric association schemes. We view the above
result as a linear algebraic generalization of their theorem.

""radial BAO size method"". Starting with fundamental cosmological notions such
as the spacetime coordinates in an expanding universe, we present the basic
principles behind the two methods. We further review the two methods in greater

presents itself as a useful tool in the study of cosmological models and

applications. Finally, we point the reader to a future prospect of upcoming
observation programs that will lead to some major improvements in the quality

multi-wavelength observations of this source that took place in 2004, 2005 and
2006. We present evidence for dimming of submm and radio flux during the peak
of near-IR flares. This suggests that the variability of Sgr A* across its
wavelength spectrum is phenomenologically related. The model explaining this
new behavior of flare activity could be consistent with adiabatically cooling
plasma blobs that are expanding but also partially eclipsing the background
quiescent emission from Sgr A*. When a flare is launched, the plasma blob is
most compact and is brightest in the optically thin regime whereas the emission
in radio/submm wavelengths has a higher opacity. Absorption in the observed
light curve of Sgr A* at radio/submm flux is due to the combined effects of
lower brightness temperature of plasma blobs with respect to the quiescent
brightness temperature and high opacity of plasma blobs. This implies that
plasma blobs are mainly placed in the magnetosphere of a disk-like flow or
further out in the flow. The depth of the absorption being larger in submm than
in radio wavelengths implies that the intrinsic size of the quiescent emission
increases with increasing wavelength which is consistent with previous size
measurements of Sgr A*. Lastly, we believe that occultation of the quiescent
emission of Sgr A* at radio/submm by IR flares can be used as a powerful tool
to identify flare activity at its earliest phase of its evolution.

transmitter and receiver for maximizing rate of reliable communication. The
channel is discrete memoryless (DMC) with i.i.d. states. The encoder takes
probing actions dependent on the message. It then uses the state information
obtained from probing causally or non-causally to generate channel input
symbols. The decoder may also take channel probing actions as a function of the
observed channel output and use the channel state information thus acquired,
along with the channel output, to estimate the message. We refer to the maximum
achievable rate for reliable communication for such systems as the 'Probing
Capacity'. We characterize this capacity when the encoder and decoder actions
are cost constrained. To motivate the problem, we begin by characterizing the
trade-off between the capacity and fraction of channel states the encoder is
allowed to observe, while the decoder is aware of channel states. In this
setting of 'to observe or not to observe' state at the encoder, we compute
certain numerical examples and note a pleasing phenomenon, where encoder can
observe a relatively small fraction of states and yet communicate at maximum
rate, i.e. rate when observing states at encoder is not cost constrained.

for the first time how a rotationally supported disk can be formed inside an
infalling envelope. The 1.33 mm continuum emission is seen arisen from both
sources, likely tracing the dusty putative disks around them. In particular,
the emission around the VLA 1 source is elongated in the equatorial plane with
a radius of ~ 300 AU. The envelope is well seen in C18O, extending to ~ 7000 AU
out from the VLA 1 source, with the innermost part overlapping with the dusty
disk. It has a differential rotation, with the outer part (~ 2000-7000 AU)
better described by a rotation that has constant specific angular momentum and
the inner part (~ 60-2000 AU) by a Keplerian rotation. The envelope seems to
also have some infall motion that is smaller than the rotation motion. Thus,
the material in the outer part of the envelope seems to be slowly spiraling
inward with its angular momentum and the rotation can indeed become Keplerian
in the inner part. A compact SO emission is seen around the VLA 1 source with a
radius of ~ 400 AU and it may trace a shock such as an (inner) accretion shock
around the disk.

Branch method. This distance puts UGC4879 beyond the radius of first turnaround
of the Local Group and ~700 kpc from its nearest neighbor Leo A. This isolation
makes this galaxy an ideal laboratory for studying pristine star formation
uncomplicated by interactions with other galaxies. We present the star
formation history of UGC4879 derived from simulated color-magnitude diagrams.

investigation proceeds by an exhaustive exploration and systematic study of the
functions computed by a large set of small Turing machines with 2 and 3 states
with particular attention to runtimes, space-usages and patterns corresponding
to the computed functions when the machines have access to larger resources

  We report that the average runtime of Turing machines computing a function
increases as a function of the number of states, indicating that non-trivial
machines tend to occupy all the resources at hand. General slow-down was
witnessed and some incidental cases of (linear) speed-up were found. Throughout
our study various interesting structures were encountered. We unveil a study of

present in Gamma_12^s, the absorptive part of the mixing. In this paper, we

therefore it is useful to study full subcategories. For instance, Bernstein,
Gelfand and Gelfand introduced a category of modules which provides a natural
setting for highest weight modules. In this paper, we define a family of

of the Poisson equation for the Newtonian gravitational field. This theory
generically predicts a violation of the strong version of the equivalence
principle, and as a result the gravitational dynamics of a system depends on
the external gravitational field in which the system is embedded. This
so-called external field effect has been recently shown to imply the existence
of an anomalous quadrupolar correction, along the direction of the external
Galactic field, in the gravitational potential felt by planets in the Solar
System. In this paper we confirm the existence of this effect by a numerical
integration of the MOND equation in the presence of an external field, and
compute the secular precession of the perihelion of planets induced by this
effect. We find that the precession effect is rather large for outer gaseous
planets, and in the case of Saturn is comparable to published residuals of
precession obtained by Saturn range tracking data. The effect is much smaller
for inner planets, but in the case of the Earth it appears to be in conflict
for most of the MOND functions $\mu(y)$ with the very good constraint on the
perihelion precession obtained from Jupiter VLBI data. The MOND functions that
are compatible with this constraint appear to have a very rapid transition from
the MONDian regime to the Newtonian one.

process of dust formation is one of the most probable. The complete dynamic

redshift technique, which can be applied to spectral data of very low

the dangers posed by the usual extraction techniques. GRB afterglows have
generally very simple optical spectra over which the separate effects of
absorption and reddening in the GRB host, the intergalactic medium, and our own
Galaxy are superimposed. We model all these effects over a series of template
afterglow spectra to produce a set of clean spectra that reproduce what would
reach our telescope. We also model carefully the effects of the
telescope-spectrograph combination and the properties of noise in the data,
which are then applied on the template spectra. The final templates are
compared to the two-dimensional spectral data, and the basic parameters
(redshift, spectral index, Hydrogen absorption column) are estimated using
statistical tools. We show how our method works by applying it to our data of
the NIR afterglow of GRB090423. At z ~ 8.2, this was the most distant object
ever observed. We use the spectrum taken by our team with the Telescopio
Nazionale Galileo to derive the GRB redshift and its intrinsic neutral Hydrogen
column density. Our best fit yields z=8.4^+0.05/-0.03 and N(HI)<5x10^20 cm^-2,
but with a highly non-Gaussian uncertainty including the redshift range z [6.7,
8.5] at the 2-sigma confidence level. Our method will be useful to maximise the
recovered information from low-quality spectra, particularly when the set of
possible spectra is limited or easily parameterisable while at the same time
ensuring an adequate confidence analysis.

the analysis of cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. Usually, such analyses
are performed in real space as well as in its dual domain, the harmonic one.

is easier to deal with partial sky coverage and experimental noise; in harmonic

effective. During the last decade, however, wavelets have emerged as a useful
tool for CMB data analysis, since they allow to combine most of the advantages

achieve high thermal-to-electric energy conversion efficiency. A key measure of
performance is the efficiency when the device is operated under maximum power
conditions. Here we study the efficiency at maximum power of three
low-dimensional, thermoelectric systems: a zero-dimensional quantum dot (QD)
with a Lorentzian transmission resonance of finite width, a one-dimensional
(1D) ballistic conductor, and a thermionic (TI) power generator formed by a
two-dimensional energy barrier. In all three systems, the efficiency at maximum
power is independent of temperature, and in each case a careful tuning of
relevant energies is required to achieve maximal performance. We find that
quantum dots perform relatively poorly under maximum power conditions, with
relatively low efficiency and small power throughput. Ideal one-dimensional
conductors offer the highest efficiency at maximum power (36% of the Carnot
efficiency). Whether 1D or TI systems achieve the larger maximum power output
depends on temperature and area filling factor. These results are also
discussed in the context of the traditional figure of merit $ZT$.

only through an intimate knowledge of perovskite oxides which have been
synthesized and characterized for decades at the IBM in the Z\""urich
laboratoty. Especially SrTiO3 and LaAlO3 have been in the focus at IBM as was
presented in Volume 1 of a series [1]. Probably for the first time detailed
microscopic investigations of the local properties of these compounds have been
obtained by studying by means of EPR the surroundings of transition metal
impurities in these materials. These experiments enabled the identification of
the order parameter of the structural instability observed in these oxides.
However, the idea to search for superconductivity came later motivated by
theoretical considerations that metallic hydrogen could become superconducting
at high temperatures. Since SrTiO3 is an insulator it was thought that the
implantation of hydrogen would render it metallic and eventually also
superconducting. This approach failed since the carrier density remained always
too small. In sequence it was then tried to achieve a metallic state in oxide
perovskites by varying their composition which was in so far promising as
reduced SrTiO3 exhibits superconductivity at 0.3K [2]. Furthermore it was
subsequently shown [3] that Tc can be enhanced to 1.2K by doping SrTiO3 with
Nb. In spite of the fact that Tc was far below values achieved in A15
compounds, a remarkable observation was connected with the Nb doped perovskite,
namely for the first time long before predicted two-gap superconductivity was
realized here.

character with a rapid early phase at z>2 during which in-situ stars are formed
within the galaxy from infalling cold gas followed by an extended phase since
z<3 during which ex-situ stars are primarily accreted. In the latter phase
massive systems grow considerably in mass and radius by accretion of smaller
satellite stellar systems formed at quite early times (z>3) outside of the
virial radius of the forming central galaxy. These tentative conclusions are
obtained from high resolution re-simulations of 39 individual galaxies in a
full cosmological context with present-day virial halo masses ranging from 7e11
M_sun h^-1 < M_vir < 2.7e13 M_sun h^-1 and central galaxy masses between 4.5e10
M_sun h^-1 < M_* < 3.6e11 M_sun h^-1. The simulations include the effects of a
uniform UV background, radiative cooling, star formation and energetic feedback
from SNII. The importance of stellar accretion increases with galaxy mass and
towards lower redshift. In our simulations lower mass galaxies ($M_* < 9e10
M_sun h^-1) accrete about 60 per cent of their present-day stellar mass. High
mass galaxy ($M_* > 1.7e11 M_sun h^-1) assembly is dominated by accretion and
merging with about 80 per cent of the stars added by the present-day. In
general the simulated galaxies approximately double their mass since z=1. For
massive systems this mass growth is not accompanied by significant star
formation. The majority of the in-situ created stars is formed at z>2,
primarily out of cold gas flows. We recover the observational result of
archaeological downsizing, where the most massive galaxies harbor the oldest
stars. We find that this is not in contradiction with hierarchical structure
formation. Most stars in the massive galaxies are formed early on in smaller
structures, the galaxies themselves are assembled late.

electron-proton and hadron collider experiments, provide tight constraints on
the parton distribution function (PDF) in the proton. The extension of these
analyses to nuclear parton distributions (nPDF) has attracted much interest in
recent years. nPDFs are needed as benchmarks for the characterization of hot
QCD matter in nucleus-nucleus collisions, and attract further interest since
they may show novel signatures of non- linear density-dependent QCD evolution.
However, it is not known from first principles whether the factorization of
long-range phenomena into process-independent parton distribution, which
underlies global PDF extractions for the proton, extends to nuclear effects. As
a consequence, assessing the reliability of nPDFs for benchmark calculations
goes beyond testing the numerical accuracy of their extraction and requires
phenomenological tests of the factorization assumption. Here we argue that a
proton-nucleus collision program at the LHC would provide a set of measurements
allowing for unprecedented tests of the factorization assumption underlying
global nPDF fits.

stellar population in 46 sources and hot dust emission associated with the
active nucleus in 59. Using a new restframe S_3um/S_1.6um versus S_um/S_3um
criterion, we identify 42 sources where the restframe 1.6um emission from the
stellar population can be measured. For these radio galaxies, the median
stellar mass is high, 2x10^11 M_sun, and remarkably constant within the range
1<z<3. At z>3, there is tentative evidence for a factor of two decrease in
stellar mass. This suggests that radio galaxies have assembled the bulk of
their stellar mass by z~3, but confirmation by more detailed decomposition of
stellar and AGN emission is needed.
  The restframe 500 MHz radio luminosities are only marginally correlated with
stellar mass but are strongly correlated with the restframe 5um hot dust
luminosity. This suggests that the radio galaxies have a large range of
Eddington ratios. We also present new Very Large Array 4.86 and 8.46 GHz

indicator of jet orientation --- is strongly correlated with hot dust
luminosity. While all of our targets were selected as narrow-lined, type 2
AGNs, this result can be understood in the context of orientation-dependent
models if there is a continuous distribution of orientations from obscured type
2 to unobscured type 1 AGNs rather than a clear dichotomy. Finally, four radio
galaxies have nearby (<6"") companions whose mid-IR colors are suggestive of
their being AGNs. This may indicate an association between radio galaxy
activity and major mergers.

  Eliminating the Usual Drawbacks","16 pages with appendix, 1 figure, submitted to ALENEX 2010",,,,"cs.MS cs.SC math.AC math.AG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present an exact and complete algorithm to isolate the real solutions of a
zero-dimensional bivariate polynomial system. The proposed algorithm
constitutes an elimination method which improves upon existing approaches in a
number of points. First, the amount of purely symbolic operations is
significantly reduced, that is, only resultant computation and square-free
factorization is still needed. Second, our algorithm neither assumes generic
position of the input system nor demands for any change of the coordinate
system. The latter is due to a novel inclusion predicate to certify that a
certain region is isolating for a solution. Our implementation exploits
graphics hardware to expedite the resultant computation. Furthermore, we
integrate a number of filtering techniques to improve the overall performance.
Efficiency of the proposed method is proven by a comparison of our
implementation with two state-of-the-art implementations, that is, LPG and
Maple's isolate. For a series of challenging benchmark instances, experiments
show that our implementation outperforms both contestants.

induced as well. Instabilities of the large scale flows and shocks could
generate a large scale turbulence whose size is comparable to the galactic disk
dimensions. We develop expressions relating underlying turbulence spectral
function to the observational power spectrum of the residual of the rotation

a given galaxy. The method is applied to the regular spiral galaxy NGC3198 with
the conclusion that it underwent a minor merger about 7 Gyr ago.

Starting from an antiferro-orbital pattern, for the easy axis case an orbital
ordered phase is induced, having strong next nearest neighbors ferro-orbital

regard to the phenotype network structure. In this paper we develop a
QTL-driven phenotype network method (QTLnet) to jointly infer a causal
phenotype network and associated genetic architecture for sets of correlated
phenotypes. Randomization of alleles during meiosis and the unidirectional
influence of genotype on phenotype allow the inference of QTLs causal to
phenotypes. Causal relationships among phenotypes can be inferred using these
QTL nodes, enabling us to distinguish among phenotype networks that would
otherwise be distribution equivalent. We jointly model phenotypes and QTLs
using homogeneous conditional Gaussian regression models, and we derive a
graphical criterion for distribution equivalence. We validate the QTLnet
approach in a simulation study. Finally, we illustrate with simulated data and
a real example how QTLnet can be used to infer both direct and indirect effects

strong increase in bias with luminosity for the most luminous galaxies, an
intermediate regime where bias does not evolve strongly over a range of two
magnitudes in galaxy luminosity, and no evidence for an upturn in bias for
fainter red galaxies. Previous work has found an increase in bias to low
luminosities that has been widely interpreted as being caused by a strong
preference for red dwarf galaxies to be satellites in the most massive halos.
We can recover such an upturn in bias to faint luminosities if we push our
measurements to small scales, and include galaxy clustering measurements along
the line-of-sight, where we expect non-linear effects to be the strongest. The

In this paper we propose a ""Multivariate Adaptive Stochastic Search"" (MASS)

standard classification method to the reduced space. One key advantage of MASS
is that it automatically adjusts to mimic variable selection type methods, such
as the Lasso, variable combination methods, such as PCA, or methods that
combine these two approaches. The adaptivity of MASS allows it to perform well
in situations where pure variable selection or variable combination methods
fail. Another major advantage of our approach is that MASS can accurately
project the data into very low-dimensional non-linear, as well as linear,
spaces. MASS uses a stochastic search algorithm to select a handful of optimal
projection directions from a large number of random directions in each
iteration. We provide some theoretical justification for MASS and demonstrate
its strengths on an extensive range of simulation studies and real world data
sets by comparing it to many classical and modern classification methods.

intensively studied. However, little is known about expressions driven by
trans-acting DNA hotspots. DNA hotspots harboring copy number aberrations are
recognized to be important in cancer as they influence multiple genes on a
global scale. The challenge in detecting trans-effects is mainly due to the
computational difficulty in detecting weak and sparse trans-acting signals
amidst co-occuring passenger events. We propose an integrative approach to
learn a sparse interaction network of DNA copy-number regions with their
downstream targets in a breast cancer dataset. Information from this network
helps distinguish copy-number driven from copy-number independent expression
changes on a global scale. Our result further delineates cis- and trans-effects
in a breast cancer dataset, for which important oncogenes such as ESR1 and
ERBB2 appear to be highly copy-number dependent. Further, our model is shown to
be efficient and in terms of goodness of fit no worse than other state-of the
art predictors and network reconstruction models using both simulated and real

of interest is the number of alcoholic drinks consumed by each subject each
day, or an ordinal version of this response, with levels corresponding to
abstinence, light drinking and heavy drinking. In these trials, within-subject
drinking patterns are often characterized by alternating periods of heavy
drinking and abstinence. For this reason, many statistical models for time
series that assume steady behavior over time and white noise errors do not fit
alcohol data well. In this paper we propose to describe subjects' drinking
behavior using Markov models and hidden Markov models (HMMs), which are better
suited to describe processes that make sudden, rather than gradual, changes
over time. We incorporate random effects into these models using a hierarchical
Bayes structure to account for correlated responses within subjects over time,
and we estimate the effects of covariates, including a randomized treatment, on
the outcome in a novel way. We illustrate the models by fitting them to a large
data set from a clinical trial of the drug Naltrexone. The HMM, in particular,
fits this data well and also contains unique features that allow for useful
clinical interpretations of alcohol consumption behavior.

We present a
model of long-run competitive markets to show that the multiplicity of
behaviors in an economic system, over a long time scale, emerge as statistical
regularities (perfectly competitive markets obey Bose-Einstein statistics and
purely monopolistic-competitive markets obey Boltzmann statistics) and that how
interaction among firms influences the evolutionary of competitive markets. It
has been widely accepted that perfect competition is most efficient. Our study
shows that the perfectly competitive system, as an extreme case of competitive
markets, is most efficient but not stable, and gives rise to economic crises as
society reaches full employment. In the economic crisis revealed by our model,
many firms condense (collapse) into the lowest supply level (zero supply,
namely bankruptcy status), in analogy to Bose-Einstein condensation. This
curious phenomenon arises because perfect competition (homogeneous
competitions) equals symmetric (indistinguishable) investment direction, a fact
abhorred by nature. Therefore, we urge the promotion of monopolistic
competition (heterogeneous competitions) rather than perfect competition. To
provide early warning of economic crises, we introduce a resolving index of
investment, which approaches zero in the run-up to an economic crisis. On the
other hand, our model discloses, as a profound conclusion, that the
technological level for a long-run social or economic system is proportional to
the freedom (disorder) of this system; in other words, technology equals the
entropy of system. As an application of this new concept, we give a possible
answer to the Needham question: ""Why was it that despite the immense
achievements of traditional China it had been in Europe and not in China that
the scientific and industrial revolutions occurred?""

theories, according to which the high-energy scattering amplitudes get
unitarized by production of extended classical objects (classicalons), playing
a role analogous to black holes, in the case of non-gravitational theories. The
key property of classicalization is the existence of a classicalizer field that
couples to energy-momentum sources. Such localized sources are excited in
high-energy scattering processes and lead to the formation of classicalons. Two
kinds of natural classicalizers are Nambu-Goldstone bosons (or, equivalently,
longitudinal polarizations of massive gauge fields) and scalars coupled to
energy-momentum type sources. Classicalization has interesting phenomenological
applications for the UV-completion of the Standard Model both with or without
the Higgs. In the Higgless Standard Model the high-energy scattering amplitudes
of longitudinal $W$-bosons self-unitarize via classicalization, without the
help of any new weakly-coupled physics. Alternatively, in the presence of a
Higgs boson, classicalization could explain the stabilization of the hierarchy.
In both scenarios the high-energy scatterings are dominated by the formation of
classicalons, which subsequently decay into many particle states. The
experimental signatures at the LHC are quite distinctive, with sharp
differences in the two cases.

that the Hubble rate during inflation depends not only on the Higgs
self-coupling, but also on the unknown couplings of the sigma field.

face-on spiral galaxy, M81, by analyzing its imaging data at 65, 90, and 140
{\mu}m taken by AKARI. Basic products are the dust temperature map, the dust
optical depth map, and the colour-colour diagram. The main features are as
follows. (i) The dust temperature derived from the total fluxes at 90 {\mu}m
and 140 {\mu}m reflects the relatively low temperatures seen in the interarm
and spiral arms excluding the warm spots, rather than the high temperatures in
warm spots and the centre. This indicates that the total FIR luminosity is
dominated by the dust heated by the general interstellar radiation field. (ii)
The galaxy is more extended at 140 {\mu}m than at the other shorter
wavelengths, which reflects the radial dust temperature gradient. (iii) The
dust optical depth derived from the FIR mapping is broadly consistent with that
estimated from the FIR-to-ultraviolet luminosity ratio. (iv) The FIR
colour-colour diagramis useful to identify a 'contamination' of warm dust. The
existence of small-scale warm star-forming regions is supported in the bright
spots along the spiral arms. This contamination also leads to an underestimate
of dust optical depth (or dust column density).

generated by a second-order inhomogeneous linear recurrence with polynomial
coefficients. This leads to a continued fraction (though not a simple continued
fraction) for Euler's constant. It seems to be the first non-trivial continued
fraction expansion convergent to Euler's constant sub-exponentially, the
elements of which can be expressed as a general pattern. It is interesting to
note that the same homogeneous recurrence generates a continued fraction for
the Euler-Gompertz constant found by Stieltjes in 1895.

intrinsic Riemannian geometric nature of Gaussian fluctuations arising from the
Hessian of the coarse graining entropy, defined over an ensemble of brane
microstates. It has been shown that the state-space geometry spanned by the set
of invariant parameters is non-degenerate, regular and has a negative scalar
curvature for the rotating Myers-Perry black holes, Kaluza-Klein black holes,
supersymmetric $AdS_5$ black holes, $D_1$-$D_5$ configurations and the
associated BMPV black holes. Interestingly, these solutions demonstrate that
the principal components of the state-space metric tensor admit a positive
definite form, while the off diagonal components do not. Furthermore, the ratio
of diagonal components weakens relatively faster than the off diagonal
components, and thus they swiftly come into an equilibrium statistical
configuration. Novel aspects of the scaling property suggest that the
brane-brane statistical pair correlation functions divulge an asymmetric
nature, in comparison with the others. This approach indicates that all above
configurations are effectively attractive and stable, on an arbitrary
hyper-surface of the state-space manifolds. It is nevertheless noticed that
there exists an intriguing relationship between non-ideal inter-brane
statistical interactions and phase transitions. The ramifications thus
described are consistent with the existing picture of the microscopic CFTs. We
conclude with an extended discussion of the implications of this work for the

The interaction of the constituents is a confining gauge interaction. The
standard electroweak model is a low energy approximation. The mixing of the
neutral weak boson with the photon is a dynamical mechanism, similar to the
mixing between the photon and the rho-meson in QCD. This mixing provides
information about the energy scale of the confining gauge force. It must be
less than 1 TeV. At and above this energy many narrow resonances should exist,
which decay into weak bosons and into lepton and quark pairs. Above 1 TeV
excited leptons should exist, which decay into leptons under emission of a weak
boson or a photon. These new states can be observed with the detectors at the
Large Hadron Collider in CERN.

understanding of pathogenesis of HIV infection from which novel antiviral
treatment guidance and strategies have been derived. Viral dynamics models
based on nonlinear differential equations have been proposed and well developed
over the past few decades. However, it is quite challenging to use experimental
or clinical data to estimate the unknown parameters (both constant and
time-varying parameters) in complex nonlinear differential equation models.
Therefore, investigators usually fix some parameter values, from the literature
or by experience, to obtain only parameter estimates of interest from clinical
or experimental data. However, when such prior information is not available, it
is desirable to determine all the parameter estimates from data. In this paper
we intend to combine the newly developed approaches, a multi-stage
smoothing-based (MSSB) method and the spline-enhanced nonlinear least squares
(SNLS) approach, to estimate all HIV viral dynamic parameters in a nonlinear
differential equation model. In particular, to the best of our knowledge, this
is the first attempt to propose a comparatively thorough procedure, accounting
for both efficiency and accuracy, to rigorously estimate all key kinetic
parameters in a nonlinear differential equation model of HIV dynamics from
clinical data. These parameters include the proliferation rate and death rate
of uninfected HIV-targeted cells, the average number of virions produced by an
infected cell, and the infection rate which is related to the antiviral
treatment effect and is time-varying. To validate the estimation methods, we
verified the identifiability of the HIV viral dynamic model and performed
simulation studies.

localizations provided by the NASA Swift mission or other satellites. Imposing
selection cuts to exclude low Galactic latitudes and high zenith angles reduces
the sample size to 41. Using matched filter techniques, the Fermi/LAT photon
data for these fields have been examined for evidence of bursts that have so
far evaded detection at energies above 100 MeV. Following comparisons with
similar random background fields, two events, GRB 080905A and GRB 091208B,
stand out as excellent candidates for such an identification. After excluding
the six bright bursts previously reported by the LAT team, the remaining 35
events exhibit an excess of LAT ""diffuse"" photons with a statistical
significance greater than 2 sigma, independent of the matched filter analysis.
After accounting for the total number of photons in the well-localized fields
and including estimates of detection efficiency, one concludes that somewhere
in the range of 11% to 19% of all GRBs within the LAT field of view illuminate
the detector with two or more energetic photons. These are the most stringent
estimates of the high energy photon content of GRBs to date. The two new events
associated with high energy photon emission have similar ratios of high to low
energy fluences as observed previously. This separates them from bursts with
similar low energy fluences by a factor of ten, suggesting a distinct class of
events rather than a smooth continuum.

as a coalition formation game with transferable utility and we propose an
algorithm for forming coalitions among the RSUs. For coalition formation, each
RSU can take an individual decision to join or leave a coalition, depending on
its utility which accounts for the generated revenues and the costs for
coalition coordination. We show that the RSUs can self-organize into a
Nash-stable partition and adapt this partition to environmental changes.
Simulation results show that, depending on different scenarios, coalition
formation presents a performance improvement, in terms of the average payoff
per RSU, ranging between 20.5% and 33.2%, relative to the non-cooperative case.

problem with an elegant geometric interpretation: the possible parameter values
of a model induce a manifold in the space of data predictions. The minimization
problem is then to find the point on the manifold closest to the data. We show
that the model manifolds of a large class of models, known as sloppy models,
have many universal features; they are characterized by a geometric series of
widths, extrinsic curvatures, and parameter-effects curvatures. A number of
common difficulties in optimizing least squares problems are due to this common
structure. First, algorithms tend to run into the boundaries of the model
manifold, causing parameters to diverge or become unphysical. We introduce the
model graph as an extension of the model manifold to remedy this problem. We
argue that appropriate priors can remove the boundaries and improve convergence
rates. We show that typical fits will have many evaporated parameters. Second,
bare model parameters are usually ill-suited to describing model behavior; cost
contours in parameter space tend to form hierarchies of plateaus and canyons.
Geometrically, we understand this inconvenient parametrization as an extremely
skewed coordinate basis and show that it induces a large parameter-effects
curvature on the manifold. Using coordinates based on geodesic motion, these
narrow canyons are transformed in many cases into a single quadratic, isotropic
basin. We interpret the modified Gauss-Newton and Levenberg-Marquardt fitting
algorithms as an Euler approximation to geodesic motion in these natural
coordinates on the model manifold and the model graph respectively. By adding a
geodesic acceleration adjustment to these algorithms, we alleviate the
difficulties from parameter-effects curvature, improving both efficiency and
success rates at finding good fits.

the bulk that is influenced by the radiation and (indirectly) by the prescribed
mass accretion rate. The obtained disk configurations are typical for

\bar t$ resonances at the LHC, in the possible case where the dynamics implies
a non-zero top polarization. As a probe of top polarization we construct an
asymmetry in the decay-lepton azimuthal angle distribution (corresponding to
the sign of $\cos\phi_\ell$) in the laboratory. The asymmetry is non-vanishing
even for a symmetric collider like the LHC, where a positive $z$ axis is not
uniquely defined. The angular distribution of the leptons has the advantage of
being a faithful top-spin analyzer, unaffected by possible anomalous $tbW$
couplings, to linear order. We study, for purposes of demonstration, the case
of a $Z'$ as might exist in the little Higgs models. We identify kinematic cuts
which ensure that our asymmetry reflects the polarization in sign and
magnitude. We investigate possibilities at the LHC with two energy options:
$\sqrt{s} = 14$ TeV and $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV, as well as at the Tevatron. At the
LHC the model predicts net top quark polarization of the order of a few per
cent for $M_{Z'} \simeq 1200 $ GeV, being as high as $10 %$ for a smaller mass
of the $Z'$ of $700$ GeV and for the largest allowed coupling in the model, the
values being higher for the $7$ TeV option. These polarizations translate to a
deviation from the standard-model value of azimuthal asymmetry of up to about
$4%$ ($7%$) for $14$ ($7$) TeV LHC, whereas for the Tevatron, values as high as
$12%$ are attained. For the $14$ TeV LHC with an integrated luminosity of 10
fb$^{-1}$, these numbers translate into a $3 \sigma$ sensitivity over a large

counterparts of CNe in M 31, only four of which were known previously. These
latter sources are still active 12.5, 11.0, 7.4 and 4.8 years after the optical

displayed short SSS phases (< 100 d). Based on these results and previous
studies we compiled a catalogue of all novae with SSS counterparts in M 31
known so far. We used this catalogue to derive correlations between the
following X-ray and optical nova parameters: turn-on time, turn-off time,
effective temperature (X-ray), t2 decay time and expansion velocity of the
ejected envelope (optical). Furthermore, we found a first hint for the
existence of a difference between SSS parameters of novae associated with the
stellar populations of the M 31 bulge and disk. Additionally, we conducted a
Monte Carlo Markov Chain simulation on the intrinsic fraction of novae with SSS
phase. This simulation showed that the relatively high fraction of novae
without detected SSS emission might be explained by the inevitably incomplete
coverage with X-ray observations in combination with a large fraction of novae
with short SSS states, as expected from the WD mass distribution. In order to
verify our results with an increased sample further monitoring observations are
needed.

Bianchi-II cosmological models representing massive strings in normal gauge for
Lyra's manifold by applying the variation law for generalized Hubble's
parameter that yields a constant value of deceleration parameter. The variation
law for Hubble's parameter generates two types of solutions for the average
scale factor, one is of power-law type and other is of the exponential form.
Using these two forms, Einstein's modified field equations are solved
separately that correspond to expanding singular and non-singular models of the
universe respectively. The energy-momentum tensor for such string as formulated
by Letelier (1983) is used to construct massive string cosmological models for
which we assume that the expansion ($\theta$) in the model is proportional to
the component $\sigma^{1}_{~1}$ of the shear tensor $\sigma^{j}_{i}$. This
condition leads to $A = (BC)^{m}$, where A, B and C are the metric coefficients
and m is proportionality constant. Our models are in accelerating phase which
is consistent to the recent observations. It has been found that the
displacement vector $\beta$ behaves like cosmological term $\Lambda$ in the
normal gauge treatment and the solutions are consistent with recent
observations of SNe Ia. It has been found that massive strings dominate in the

Some physical and geometric behaviour of these models are also discussed.

  Determine the Direction of Coronal Mass Ejections from Heliospheric Imagers
  Observations","17 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, accepted to Solar Physics","Solar Physics, 267, 411-429 (2010)","10.1007/s11207-010-9654-9",,"astro-ph.SR physics.space-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Using data from the Heliospheric Imagers (HIs) onboard STEREO, it is possible
to derive the direction of propagation of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in
addition to their speed with a variety of methods. For CMEs observed by both
STEREO spacecraft, it is possible to derive their direction using simultaneous
observations from the twin spacecraft and also, using observations from only
one spacecraft with fitting methods. This makes it possible to test and compare
different analyses techniques. In this article, we propose a new fitting method
based on observations from one spacecraft, which we compare to the commonly
used fitting method of Sheeley et al. (1999). We also compare the results from
these two fitting methods with those from two stereoscopic methods, focusing on
12 CMEs observed simultaneously by the two STEREO spacecraft in 2008 and 2009.
We find evidence that the fitting method of Sheeley et al. (1999) can result in
significant errors in the determination of the CME direction when the CME
propagates outside of 60deg \pm 20 deg from the Sun-spacecraft line. We expect
our new fitting method to be better adapted to the analysis of halo or limb
CMEs with respect to the observing spacecraft. We also find some evidence that
direct triangulation in the HI fields-of-view should only be applied to CMEs
propagating approximatively towards Earth (\pm 20deg from the Sun-Earth line).
Last, we address one of the possible sources of errors of fitting methods: the
assumption of radial propagation. Using stereoscopic methods, we find that at
least seven of the 12 studied CMEs had an heliospheric deflection of less than
20deg as they propagated in the HI fields-of-view, which, we believe, validates
this approximation.

point set. In this note we prove lower bounds for the L_2 discrepancy of
arbitrary N-point sets. Our main focus is on the two-dimensional case.
Asymptotic upper and lower estimates of the L_2-discrepancy in dimension 2 are
well-known and are of the sharp order sqrt(log N). Nevertheless the gap in the
constants between the best known lower and upper bounds is unsatisfactory large
for a two-dimensional problem. Our lower bound improves upon this situation
considerably. The main method is an adaption of the method of K. F. Roth using
the Fourier coefficients of the discrepancy function with respect to the Haar
basis.
