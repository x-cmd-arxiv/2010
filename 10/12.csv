contact angle $\theta_0$ that a sessile drop adopts on it, and the value of the
liquid pressure threshold the surface can withstand without being impaled by
the liquid, hence keeping a low-friction condition. We designed surfaces
covered with nano-wires obtained by the vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) growth
technique, that are able to repel most of the existing non-polar liquids
including those of very low surface tension, as well as many polar liquids of
moderate to high surface tension. These super-omniphobic surfaces exhibit
apparent contact angles ranging from 125 to 160$^{\circ}$ depending on the
liquid. We tested the robustness of the surfaces against impalement by carrying
out drop impact experiments. Our results show how this robustness depends on
the Young's contact angle $\theta_0$ related to the surface tension of the
liquid, and that the orientational growth of NWs is a favorable factor for
robustness.

While research into the diagnostic potential and general medical relevance of
these trace gases is conducted on a considerable scale, little focus has been
given so far to a sound analysis of the quantitative relationships between
breath levels and the underlying systemic concentrations. This paper is devoted
to a thorough modeling study of the end-tidal breath dynamics associated with
isoprene, which serves as a paradigmatic example for the class of low-soluble,
blood-borne VOCs.
  Real-time measurements of exhaled breath under an ergometer challenge reveal
characteristic changes of isoprene output in response to variations in
ventilation and perfusion. Here, a valid compartmental description of these
profiles is developed. By comparison with experimental data it is inferred that
the major part of breath isoprene variability during exercise conditions can be
attributed to an increased fractional perfusion of potential storage and
production sites, leading to higher levels of mixed venous blood concentrations
at the onset of physical activity. In this context, various lines of supportive
evidence for an extrahepatic tissue source of isoprene are presented.
  Our model is a first step towards new guidelines for the breath gas analysis
of isoprene and is expected to aid further investigations regarding the
exhalation, storage, transport and biotransformation processes associated with
this important compound.

characterize their close environment. In 1974, a close companion was discovered
around the pulsating star beta Cep using the speckle interferometry technique
and features at the limit of resolution (20 milli-arcsecond or mas) of the
instrument were mentioned that may be due to circumstellar material. Beta Cep
has a magnetic field that might be responsible for a spherical shell or
ring-like structure around the star as described by the MHD models. Using the
visible recombiner VEGA installed on the CHARA long-baseline interferometer at
Mt. Wilson, we aim to determine the angular diameter of beta Cep and resolve
its close environment with a spatial resolution up to 1 mas level. Medium
spectral resolution (R=6000) observations of beta Cep were secured with the
VEGA instrument over the years 2008 and 2009. These observations were performed
with the S1S2 (30m) and W1W2 (100m) baselines of the array. We investigated
several models to reproduce our observations. A large-scale structure of a few
mas is clearly detected around the star with a typical flux relative
contribution of 0.23 +- 0.02. Our best model is a co-rotational geometrical
thin ring around the star as predicted by magnetically-confined wind shock
models. The ring inner diameter is 8.2 +- 0.8 mas and the width is 0.6 +- 0.7
mas. The orientation of the rotation axis on the plane of the sky is PA = 60 +-
1 deg, while the best fit of the mean angular diameter of beta Cep gives UD[V]
= 0.22 +- 0.05 mas. Our data are compatible with the predicted position of the
close companion of beta Cep. These results bring additional constraints on the
fundamental parameters and on the future MHD and asteroseismological models of
the star.

of challenges, being inspired by such scenarios. A key challenge is that of
presenting the results to the users in an understandable and clear-cut fashion
in order to facilitate the analysis of the results. Indeed, such scenarios
evoke the opportunity to rank and group the results according to specific
criteria. A further challenge consists of presenting the results to the user in
an asynchronous fashion, i.e. the 'push' mode, along with the 'pull' mode, in
which the user explicitly issues a query, and displays the results. Moreover,
an important issue to consider in real-life cases is the possibility of
submitting a query to multiple providers, and collecting the various results.

suitably addresses the above challenges. We have conducted a comprehensive
experimental study, in order to investigate the usability of the system, the

transition driven by Josephson coupling among these nanoscale grains. This
approach reproduces the well known critical temperature transition $T_c(p)$ as

reproduces the main features measured by several experiments. Furthermore, the

activity in fast-rotating M-dwarfs using deep XMM-Newton observations of 97
low-mass stars of known rotation period in the young open cluster NGC 2547, and
combine these with published X-ray surveys of low-mass field and cluster stars
of known rotation period. Like G- and K-dwarfs, we find that M-dwarfs exhibit
increasing coronal activity with decreasing Rossby number N_R, the ratio of
period to convective turnover time, and that activity saturates at L_x/L_bol ~
10^-3 for log N_R < -0.8. However, super-saturation is not convincingly
displayed by M-dwarfs, despite the presence of many objects in our sample with
log N_R < -1.8, where super-saturation is observed to occur in higher mass
stars. Instead, it appears that a short rotation period is the primary
predictor of super-saturation; P <=0.3d for K-dwarfs and perhaps P <=0.2d for
M-dwarfs. These observations favour the ""centrifugal stripping"" model for
super-saturation, where coronal structures are forced open or become
radiatively unstable as the Keplerian co-rotation radius moves inside the X-ray

communication systems. To accommodate high operating rates while retaining low
computational cost, efficient analog-to digital (ADC) converters must be
developed. Many of limitations encountered in current converters are due to a
traditional assumption that the sampling state needs to acquire the data at the
Nyquist rate, corresponding to twice the signal bandwidth. In this thesis a
method of sampling far below the Nyquist rate for sparse spectrum multiband
signals is investigated. The method is called periodic non-uniform sampling,
and it is useful in a variety of applications such as data converters, sensor
array imaging and image compression. Firstly, a model for the sampling system
in the frequency domain is prepared. It relates the Fourier transform of
observed compressed samples with the unknown spectrum of the signal. Next, the
reconstruction process based on the topic of compressed sensing is provided. We
show that the sampling parameters play an important role on the average sample
ratio and the quality of the reconstructed signal. The concept of condition
number and its effect on the reconstructed signal in the presence of noise is
introduced, and a feasible approach for choosing a sample pattern with a low
condition number is given. We distinguish between the cases of known spectrum
and unknown spectrum signals respectively. One of the model parameters is
determined by the signal band locations that in case of unknown spectrum
signals should be estimated from sampled data. Therefore, we applied both
subspace methods and non-linear least square methods for estimation of this
parameter. We also used the information theoretic criteria (Akaike and MDL) and
the exponential fitting test techniques for model order selection in this case.

Markov shifts with respect to a non-negative scaling function and an arbitrary
subset of finite words. Firstly, the scaling function allows a direct access to
important thermodynamical quantities, which are usually given only implicitly
by certain identities involving the classically defined pressure. In this
context we generalise Savchenko's definition of entropy for special flows to a
corresponding notion of topological pressure and show that this new notion
coincides with the induced pressure for a large class of H\""older continuous
height functions not necessarily bounded away from zero. Secondly, the
dependence on the subset of words gives rise to interesting new results
connecting the Gurevi{\vc} and the classical pressure with exhausting
principles for a large class of Markov shifts. In this context we consider
dynamical group extentions to demonstrate that our new approach provides a
useful tool to characterise amenability of the underlying group structure.

originally proposed as an upper bound on its Shannon capacity. Furthermore,
probabilistic theories beyond quantum mechanics may have an even larger

discuss in detail, and compare, the sets of probability distributions
attainable by noncontextual, quantum, and generalized models; the latter two

carbon atoms) than SB galaxies. The ratio between the ionized (7.7) and the

depend on the hardness of the radiation field. The equivalent width of both PAH

ratios which are clearly caused solely by UV excitation, but the H2 emission of
several objects may be caused by UV or X-ray excitation in the presence of
circumstellar dust. There are several objects in the sample whose observed

is now considered as one of the main parameters, alongside mass and metallicity

mixing processes induced by rotation may be so efficient that helium produced
in the center is mixed throughout the envelope. Such stars evolve almost
chemically homogeneously. At low metallicity they remain blue and compact,
while they gradually evolve into Wolf-Rayet stars and possibly into progenitors
of long gamma-ray bursts.
  In binaries this type of evolution may occur because of (I) tides in very
close binaries, as a result of (II) spin up by mass transfer, as result of
(III) a merger of the two stars and (IV) when one of the components in the
binary was born with a very high initial rotation rate. As these stars stay
compact, the evolutionary channels are very different from what classical
binary evolutionary models predict. In this contribution we discuss examples of
nearly chemically homogeneous evolution in very close tidally-locked binaries.
Even in such very close massive binaries, the stars may remain compact and
avoid mass transfer, while Roche lobe overflow and a merger would be inevitable
in the classical picture. This type of evolution may provide an alternative
path to form tight Wolf-Rayet binaries and massive black hole binaries.

color based quests of blue massive stars are relatively successful, they must

the key points of the method is the photometric criterion to choose candidate
OB stars from the reddening-free Q parameter, that could be easily extended to
include from GALEX to near-IR photometry. While not a new idea, one of our

for the members, enabling a quick and more insightful choice of candidates for
spectroscopy, and the identification of potential advanced evolutionary stages.

integrable Euclidean $CP^{N-1}$ sigma model in two dimension and their
associated surfaces immersed in the $su(N)$ Lie algebra. We reinterpret and
generalize the proof of A.M. Din and W.J. Zakzrewski [1980] that any solution
for the $CP^{N-1}$$ sigma model defined on the Riemann sphere with finite
action can be written as a raising operator acting on a holomorphic one, or a
lowering operator acting on a antiholomorphic one. Our proof is formulated in
terms of rank-1 Hermitian projectors so it is explicitly gauge invariant and
gives new results on the structure of the corresponding sequence of rank-1
projectors. Next, we analyze surfaces associated with the $CP^{N-1}$ models
defined using the Generalized Weierstrass Formula for immersion, introduced by
B. Konopelchenko [1996]. We show that the surfaces are conformally
parameterized by the Lagrangian density with finite area equal to the action of
the model and express several other geometrical characteristics of the surface
in terms of the Lagrangian density and topological charge density of the model.
We demonstrate that any such surface must be orthogonal to the sequence of
projectors defined by repeated application of the raising and lowering
operators. Finally, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions that a
surface be related to a $CP^{N-1}$ sigma model.

dark energy. The Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect is sensitive to dark
energy and presents an independent signature of dark energy in the absence of
modified gravity and curvature. The ISW effect occurs on large scales, where
cosmic variance is high and where there are large amounts of missing data in
the CMB and large scale structure maps due to Galactic confusion. Moreover,
existing methods in the literature often make strong assumptions about the
statistics of the underlying fields or estimators. Together these effects can
severely limit signal extraction. We review literature on the ISW effect,
comparing statistical subtleties between existing methods, and identifying
several limitations. We propose a novel method to detect and measure the ISW
signal. This method assumes only that the primordial CMB field is Gaussian. It
is based on a sparse inpainting method to reconstruct missing data and uses a
bootstrap technique to avoid assumptions about the statistics of the estimator.
It is a complete method, using three complementary statistical methods. We
apply our method to Euclid-like simulations and show we can expect a \sim
7\sigma model-independent detection of the ISW signal with WMAP7-like data,
even with missing data. Other tests return \sim 4.7\sigma detection levels for
a Euclid-like survey, with levels independent from whether the galaxy field is
normally or lognormally distributed. We apply our method to the 2 Micron All
Sky Survey (2MASS) and WMAP7 CMB data and find detections in the 1.1 -
2.0\sigma range, as expected from simulations. As a by-product, we reconstruct
the full-sky temperature ISW field due to 2MASS data. We have presented a novel
technique, based on sparse inpainting and bootstrapping, which accurately
detects and reconstructs the ISW effect.

  Coll., 12-16 July 2010",,,,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Stellar models of massive single stars are still plagued by major
uncertainties. Testing and calibrating against observations is essential for
their reliability. For this purpose one preferably uses observed stars that
have never experienced strong binary interaction, i.e. ""true single stars"".
However, the binary fraction among massive stars is high and identifying ""true
single stars"" is not straight forward. Binary interaction affects systems in
such a way that the initially less massive star becomes, or appears to be,
single. For example, mass transfer results in a widening of the orbit and a
decrease of the luminosity of the donor star, which makes it very hard to
detect. After a merger or disruption of the system by the supernova explosion,
no companion will be present.
  The only unambiguous identification of ""true single stars"" is possible in
detached binaries, which contain two main-sequence stars. For these systems we
can exclude the occurrence of mass transfer since their birth. A further
advantage is that binaries can often provide us with direct measurements of the
fundamental stellar parameters. Therefore, we argue these binaries are worth
the effort needed to observe and analyze them. They may provide the most
stringent test cases for single stellar models.

interesting laboratories to study star formation. After having investigated
their star-forming properties, we use photospheric, nebular and dust modeling
to analyze here their spectral energy distribution (SED) from the
far-ultraviolet to the mid-infrared regime for a sample of 7 star-forming
regions. Our analysis confirms that the intergalactic star forming regions in
Stephan's Quintet, around Arp 105, and NGC 5291, appear devoid of stellar
populations older than 10^9 years. We also find an excess of light in the
near-infrared regime (from 2 to 4.5 microns) which cannot be attributed to
stellar photospheric or nebular contributions. This excess is correlated with
the star formation rate intensity suggesting that it is probably due to
emission by very small grains fluctuating in temperature as well as the
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) line at 3.3 micron. Comparing the
attenuation via the Balmer decrement to the mid-infrared emission allows us to
check the reliability of the attenuation estimate. It suggests the presence of
embedded star forming regions in NGC 5291 and NGC 7252. Overall the SED of
star-forming regions in collision debris (and Tidal Dwarf Galaxies) resemble
more that of dusty star-forming regions in galactic disks than to that of

observations were motivated by the system's high mass ratio and low luminosity
ratio, leading to a large beaming-induced variability amplitude at the orbital
period of 5.6 hr. We observed the system during 3 nights at the 2.0m Faulkes
Telescope North with the SDSS-g' filter, and fitted the data simultaneously for
the beaming, ellipsoidal and reflection effects. Our fitted relative beaming
amplitude is (3.0 +/- 0.4) x 10^(-3), consistent with the expected amplitude
from a blackbody spectrum given the photometric primary radial velocity
amplitude and effective temperature. This result is a first step in testing the
relation between the photometric beaming amplitude and the spectroscopic radial
velocity amplitude in NLTT 11748 and similar systems. We did not identify any
variability due to the ellipsoidal or reflection effects, consistent with their
expected undetectable amplitude for this system. Low-mass, helium-core WDs are
expected to reside in binary systems where in some of those systems the binary
companion is a faint C/O WD and the two stars are detached and non-interacting,

The ""mass discrepancy"" in massive O stars represents a long-standing
problem in stellar astrophysics with far-reaching implications for the chemical
and dynamical feedback in galaxies. Aims. Our goal is to investigate this mass
discrepancy by comparing state-of-the-art model masses with model-independent
masses determined from eclipsing binaries. Methods. Using stellar evolution
models and a recent calibration of stellar parameters for O-star spectral
sub-classes, we present a convenient way to convert observed solar metallicity
O star spectral types into model masses, which we subsequently compare to our
dynamical mass compilation. We also derive similar conversions for LMC and SMC
metallcities. Results. We obtain good agreement between model and dynamical
masses, suggesting the long-standing problem of a systematic mass discrepancy
problem might have been solved. We also provide error ranges for the model
masses, as well as minimal and maximal age estimates for when the model stars
are in a given spectral type box.

globular cluster over its entire life time on a star-by-star basis. Using
recent GPU hardware at Bonn University, we have performed a comprehensive set
of $N$-body calculations to model the distant outer halo globular cluster
Palomar 14 (Pal 14). By varying the initial conditions we aim at finding an
initial $N$-body model which reproduces the observational data best in terms of
its basic parameters, i.e. half-light radius, mass and velocity dispersion. We
furthermore focus on reproducing the stellar mass function slope of Pal 14
which was found to be significantly shallower than in most globular clusters.
While some of our models can reproduce Pal 14's basic parameters reasonably
well, we find that dynamical mass segregation alone cannot explain the mass
function slope of Pal 14 when starting from the canonical Kroupa initial mass
function (IMF). In order to seek for an explanation for this discrepancy, we
compute additional initial models with varying degrees of primordial mass
segregation as well as with a flattened IMF. The necessary degree of primordial
mass segregation turns out to be very high. This modelling has shown that the
initial conditions of Pal 14 after gas expulsion must have been a half-mass
radius of about 20 pc, a mass of about 50000 M$_{\odot}$, and possibly some
mass segregation or an already established non-canonical IMF depleted in
low-mass stars. Such conditions might be obtained by a violent early
gas-expulsion phase from an embedded cluster born with mass segregation. Only
at large Galactocentric radii are clusters likely to survive as bound entities
the destructive gas-expulsion process we seem to have uncovered for Pal 14. In
addition we compute a model with a 5% primordial binary fraction to test if
such a population has an effect on the cluster's evolution.

Ia). Using events identified by the Palomar Transient Factory and subsequently
verified by ground-based spectroscopy, we demonstrate the ability to locate and
classify SNe Ia as early as 16 days prior to maximum light. This enables us to
trigger HST in a non-disruptive mode to obtain near UV spectra within a few
days of maximum light for comparison with earlier equivalent ground-based
spectroscopic campaigns conducted at intermediate redshifts, z ~ 0.5. We
analyze the spectra of 12 Type Ia supernovae located in the Hubble flow with
0.01 < z < 0.08. Although a fraction of our eventual sample, these data,
together with archival data, already provide a substantial advance over that
previously available. Restricting samples to those of similar phase and
stretch, the mean UV spectrum agrees reasonably closely with that at
intermediate redshift, although some differences are found in the metallic
absorption features. A larger sample will determine whether these differences
reflect possible sample biases or are a genuine evolutionary effect.
Significantly, the wavelength-dependent dispersion, which is larger in the UV,
follows similar trends to that observed at intermediate redshift and is driven,
in part, by differences in the various metallic features. While the origin of
the UV dispersion remains uncertain, our comparison suggests that it may
reflect compositional variations amongst our sample rather than being
predominantly an evolutionary effect.

Aharonov-Bohm scattering due to the Berry phase acquired by a quasiparticle
upon circling a vortex, and effective potential scattering due to the superflow
swirling about the vortices. In this paper, we consider the Berry phase
contribution in the absence of superflow, which results in branch cuts between
neighboring vortices across which the quasiparticle wave function changes sign.
Here, the simplest problem that captures the physics is that of scattering from
a single finite branch cut that stretches between two vortices. Elliptical
coordinates are natural for this two-center problem, and we proceed by
separating the massless Dirac equation in elliptical coordinates. The separated
equations take the form of the Whittaker-Hill equations, which we solve to
obtain radial and angular eigenfunctions. With these eigenfunctions in hand, we
construct the scattering cross section via partial wave analysis. We discuss
the scattering effect of Berry phase in the absence of superflow, having
considered the superflow effect in the absence of Berry phase in a separate
paper. We also provide qualitative comparison of transport cross sections for
the Berry phase and the Superflow effects. The important issue of interference

evidence that might be indicative of a process involving solar rotation.
Smoothing of the power spectrum by weighted-running-mean analysis leads to a
significant peak at frequency 11.18/yr, which is lower than the equatorial
synodic rotation rates of the convection and radiative zones. This article
concerns measurements of the decay rates of Ra-226 acquired at the

(but not identical) analysis yields a significant peak in the PTB dataset at
frequency 11.21/yr, and a peak in the BNL dataset at 11.25/yr. The change in
the BNL result is not significant since the uncertainties in the BNL and PTB
analyses are estimated to be 0.13/yr and 0.07/yr, respectively. Combining the
two running means by forming the joint power statistic leads to a highly
significant peak at frequency 11.23/yr. We comment briefly on the possible

investigate the distribution of fossils of primordial dwarf galaxies within,

agreement between the observed stellar properties of a subset of the
ultra-faint dwarfs and our simulated fossils. Here, we show that fossils of the
first galaxies have galactocentric distributions and cumulative luminosity
functions consistent with observations. In our model there are ~ 300 luminous
satellites orbiting the Milky Way, ~50-70% of which are well preserved fossils,
with this fraction decreasing with galactocentric distance. Within the Milky
Way virial radius, the majority of these fossils have luminosities L_V<10^5
L_solar. This work produces an overabundance of bright dwarf satellites (L_V >
10^4 L_solar) with respect to observations where observations are nearly
complete. The ""bright satellite problem"" is most evident in the outer parts of
the Milky Way. We estimate that, although relatively bright, the primordial
stellar populations are very diffuse, producing a population with surface
brightnesses below surveys` detection limits and are easily stripped by tidal
forces. Although we cannot yet present unmistakable evidence for the existence
of the fossils of first galaxies in the Local Group, the results of our studies
suggest observational strategies that may demonstrate their existence.
Primarily, the detection of ""ghost halos"" of primordial stars around isolated
dwarfs would prove that stars formed in minihalos (M<10^8 M_solar) before
reionization, and strongly suggest that at least a fraction of the ultra-faint
dwarfs are fossils of the first galaxies.

signals from compressed linear measurements. In fact, exact thresholds on the
sparsity (the size of the support set), under which with high probability a
sparse signal can be recovered from i.i.d. Gaussian measurements, have been
computed and are referred to as ""weak thresholds"" \cite{D}. It was also known
that there is a tradeoff between the sparsity and the $\ell_1$ minimization
recovery stability. In this paper, we give a \emph{closed-form}
characterization for this tradeoff which we call the scaling law for
compressive sensing recovery stability. In a nutshell, we are able to show that
as the sparsity backs off $\varpi$ ($0<\varpi<1$) from the weak threshold of
$\ell_1$ recovery, the parameter for the recovery stability will scale as
$\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\varpi}}$. Our result is based on a careful analysis through
the Grassmann angle framework for the Gaussian measurement matrix. We will
further discuss how this scaling law helps in analyzing the iterative

signal support follow an amplitude probability density function (pdf)
$f(\cdot)$ whose $t$-th derivative $f^{t}(0) \neq 0$ for some integer $t \geq

analytically shown to lift the phase transition thresholds (weak thresholds) of

~1/4 of the sky at the distance resolution permitted by the absolute magnitude
distribution of MSTO stars. We find large variations of BHB/MSTO star ratio in
the stellar halo. Previously identified, stream-like halo structures have
distinctive BHB/MSTO ratios, indicating different ages/metallicities. Some halo
features, e.g., the low-latitude structure, appear to be almost completely

The Sagittarius tidal stream shows an apparent variation in BHB/MSTO ratio

variations between different stellar halo substructures provides yet more

velocity also obeys a power-law relationship with binary separation, but the

majority of the results obtained, thus far, in this field and reviewed in this
article are theoretical. Nevertheless, relevant experimental settings are
surveyed too, with emphasis on perspectives for implementation of the
theoretical predictions in the experiment. Physical systems discussed in the
review belong to the realms of nonlinear optics (including artificial optical
media, such as photonic crystals, and plasmonics) and Bose-Einstein
condensation (BEC). The solitons are considered in one, two, and three
dimensions (1D, 2D, and 3D). Basic properties of the solitons presented in the
review are their existence, stability, and mobility. Although the field is
still far from completion, general conclusions can be drawn. In particular, a
novel fundamental property of 1D solitons, which does not occur in the absence
of NLs, is a finite threshold value of the soliton norm, necessary for their
existence. In multidimensional settings, the stability of solitons supported by
the spatial modulation of the nonlinearity is a truly challenging problem, for
the theoretical and experimental studies alike. In both the 1D and 2D cases,
the mechanism which creates solitons in NLs is principally different from its
counterpart in linear lattices, as the solitons are created directly, rather
than bifurcating from Bloch modes of linear lattices.

and Lyapunov exponents. The stretching and folding motion exemplified by the
baker's map is shown to give rise to a dynamical system with a positive
Lyapunov exponent, the hallmark of chaotic mixing. On the other hand, cutting
and shuffling does not stretch. When an interval exchange transformation is
used as the basis for cutting and shuffling, we establish that all of the map's
Lyapunov exponents are zero. Mixing, as quantified by the interfacial area per
unit volume, is shown to be exponentially fast when there is stretching and
folding, but linear when there is only cutting and shuffling. We also discuss
how a simple computational approach can discern stretching in discrete data.

method to solve a Sensor Network Localization problem, which attempts to
determine the locations of a group of sensors given the distances between some
of them [11]. In this paper, we analyze and determine new sufficient conditions
and formulations that guarantee that the SDP relaxation is exact, i.e., gives
the correct solution. These conditions can be useful for designing sensor
networks and managing connectivities in practice.
  Our main contribution is twofold: We present the first non-asymptotic bound
on the connectivity or radio range requirement of the sensors in order to
ensure the network is uniquely localizable. Determining this range is a key
component in the design of sensor networks, and we provide a result that leads
to a correct localization of each sensor, for any number of sensors. Second, we
introduce a new class of graphs that can always be correctly localized by an
SDP relaxation. Specifically, we show that adding a simple objective function
to the SDP relaxation model will ensure that the solution is correct when
applied to a triangulation graph. Since triangulation graphs are very sparse,
this is informationally efficient, requiring an almost minimal amount of
distance information. We also analyze a number objective functions for the SDP
relaxation to solve the localization problem for a general graph.

systematic classification of probability distributions. Here, we unify the
disparate forms of common distributions into a single system based on two

and the CO(3-2) line with the Submillimeter Array. Combining these data allows
us to compare the emission in the three lines and to map the line ratios,
R21=I_{CO(2-1)}/I_{CO(1-0)} and R32=I_{CO(3-2)}/I_{CO(1-0)} at a resolution of
~2"", i.e., a linear resolution of 160 pc for NGC4569 and 40 pc for NGC4826. In
both galaxies the emission in the three lines is similarly distributed
spatially and in velocity, and CO is less excited (R32<0.6) than in the
Galactic Center or the centers of other active galaxies studied so far.
According to a pseudo-LTE model the molecular gas in NGC4569 is cold and mainly
optically thick in the CO(1-0) and (2-1) lines; less than 50% of the gas is
optically thin in the CO(3-2) line. LVG modeling suggests the presence of an
elongated ring of cold and dense gas coinciding with the ILR of the stellar
bar. More excited gas is resolved in the circumnuclear disk of NGC4826.
According to our pseudo-LTE model this corresponds to warmer gas with a ~50% of
the CO(3-2) emission being optically thin. LVG modeling indicates the presence
of a semicircular arc of dense and cold gas centered on the dynamical center
and ~70 pc in radius. The gas temperature increases and its density decreases
toward the center. A near side/far side asymmetry noticeable in the CO, R32 and
Pa-alpha maps suggests that opacity effects play a role. Examining published CO
maps of nearby active galaxies we find similar asymmetries suggesting that this
could be a common phenomenon in active galaxies. These mainly qualitative
results open new perspectives for the study of active galaxies with the future
Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array.

another has many applications in quantum information science. To this mapping
there corresponds an affine map which provides a geometric description of the
density matrix in terms of the polarization vector representation. This has
been thoroughly explored for qubits since the components of the polarization
vector are measurable quantities (corresponding to expectation values of
Hermitian operators) and also because it enables the description of map domains
geometrically. Here we extend the OS-affine map correspondence to qudits,
briefly discuss general properties of the map, the form for particular
important cases, and provide several explicit results for qutrit maps. We use
the affine map and a singular-value-like decomposition, to find positivity
constraints that provide a symmetry for small polarization vector magnitudes
(states which are closer to the maximally mixed state) which is broken as the
polarization vector increases in magnitude (a state becomes more pure). The
dependence of this symmetry on the magnitude of the polarization vector implies
the polar decomposition of the map can not be used as it can for the qubit
case. However, it still leads us to a connection between positivity and purity
for general d-state systems.

presence of magnetic field and anisotropic thermal conduction. We perform first
cosmological simulations of galaxy cluster formation that simultaneously
include magnetic fields, radiative cooling and anisotropic thermal conduction.
In isolated and idealized cluster models, the magnetothermal instability (MTI)
tends to reorient the magnetic fields radially. Using cosmological simulations
of the Santa Barbara cluster we detect radial bias in the velocity and magnetic
fields. Such radial bias is consistent with either the inhomogeneous radial gas
flows due to substructures or residual MTI-driven field rearangements that are
expected even in the presence of turbulence. Although disentangling the two
scenarios is challenging, we do not detect excess bias in the runs that include
anisotropic thermal conduction. The anisotropy effect is potentially detectable
via radio polarization measurements with LOFAR and SKA and future X-ray
spectroscopic studies with the IXO. We demonstrate that radiative cooling
boosts the amplification of the magnetic field by about two orders of magnitude
beyond what is expected in the non-radiative cases. At z=0 the field is
amplified by a factor of about 10^6 compared to the uniform magnetic field
evolved due to the universal expansion alone. Interestingly, the runs that
include both radiative cooling and anisotropic thermal conduction exhibit
stronger magnetic field amplification than purely radiative runs at the
off-center locations. In these runs, shallow temperature gradients away from
the cluster center make the ICM neutrally buoyant. The ICM is more easily mixed
in these regions and the winding up of the frozen-in magnetic field is more
efficient resulting in stronger magnetic field amplification.

early-type (elliptical and lenticular) galaxies is that tidally-induced
asymmetric structure should correlate with signatures of a relatively young
stellar population. Such a signature was found by Schweizer and Seitzer (1992;
AJ, 104, 1039) at roughly 4sigma confidence. In this paper, we revisit this
issue with a nearly ten-fold larger sample of 0.01<z<0.03 galaxies selected
from the Two Micron All-Sky Survey and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We
parameterize tidal structure using a repeatable algorithmic measure of
asymmetry, and correlate this with color offset from the early-type galaxy
color-magnitude relation. We recover the color offset-asymmetry correlation;
furthermore, we demonstrate observationally for the first time that this effect
is driven by a highly-significant trend towards younger ages at higher
asymmetry values. We present a simple model for the evolution of early-type
galaxies through gas-rich major and minor mergers that reproduces their
observed build-up from z=1 to the present day and the distribution of
present-day colors and ages. We show using this model that if both stellar
populations and asymmetry were ideal `clocks' measuring the time since last
major or minor gas-rich interaction, then we would expect a rather tight
correlation between age and asymmetry. We suggest that the source of extra
scatter is natural diversity in progenitor star formation history, gas content,
and merger mass ratio, but quantitative confirmation of this conjecture will
require sophisticated modeling. We conclude that the asymmetry-age correlation
is in basic accord with the merger hypothesis, and indicates that an important
fraction of the early-type galaxy population is affected by major or minor
mergers at cosmologically-recent times.

contains both walls. Moreover, the BPS mass of the black hole composite (in its

The Newtonian three-body problem admits Euler's collinear solution, where three
bodies move around the common center of mass with the same orbital period and
always line up. The solution is unstable. Hence it is unlikely that such a
simple configuration would exist owing to general relativistic forces dependent
not only on the masses but also on the velocity of each body. However, we show

  programming","final version; to appear in IEEE Transactions on Information Theory",,,,"cs.IT cs.SY math.IT math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the intrinsic limitations of sequential convex optimization through
the lens of feedback information theory. In the oracle model of optimization,
an algorithm queries an {\em oracle} for noisy information about the unknown
objective function, and the goal is to (approximately) minimize every function
in a given class using as few queries as possible. We show that, in order for a
function to be optimized, the algorithm must be able to accumulate enough
information about the objective. This, in turn, puts limits on the speed of
optimization under specific assumptions on the oracle and the type of feedback.
Our techniques are akin to the ones used in statistical literature to obtain
minimax lower bounds on the risks of estimation procedures; the notable
difference is that, unlike in the case of i.i.d. data, a sequential
optimization algorithm can gather observations in a {\em controlled} manner, so
that the amount of information at each step is allowed to change in time. In
particular, we show that optimization algorithms often obey the law of
diminishing returns: the signal-to-noise ratio drops as the optimization
algorithm approaches the optimum. To underscore the generality of the tools, we
use our approach to derive fundamental lower bounds for a certain active
learning problem. Overall, the present work connects the intuitive notions of
information in optimization, experimental design, estimation, and active
learning to the quantitative notion of Shannon information.

optimization, control, communications, signal processing, and machine learning.
A precise characterization of their fundamental limitations is therefore of
paramount importance. In this paper, we consider the general problem of
adaptively controlling and/or identifying a stochastic dynamical system, where
our {\em a priori} knowledge allows us to place the system in a subset of a
metric space (the uncertainty set). We present an information-theoretic
meta-theorem that captures the trade-off between the metric complexity (or
richness) of the uncertainty set, the amount of information acquired online in
the process of controlling and observing the system, and the residual
uncertainty remaining after the observations have been collected. Following the
approach of Zames, we quantify {\em a priori} information by the Kolmogorov
(metric) entropy of the uncertainty set, while the information acquired online
is expressed as a sum of information divergences. The general theory is used to
derive new minimax lower bounds on the metric identification error, as well as
to give a simple derivation of the minimum time needed to stabilize an
uncertain stochastic linear system.

this paper we show that for every connected graph G, with minimum degree at

where {\gamma}_c(G) is the connected domination number of G. Bounds of the form
diameter(G) \leq rc(G) \leq diameter(G) + c, 1 \leq c \leq 4, for many special
graph classes follow as easy corollaries from this result. This includes
interval graphs, AT-free graphs, circular arc graphs, threshold graphs, and
chain graphs all with minimum degree at least 2 and connected. We also show
that every bridge-less chordal graph G has rc(G) \leq 3.radius(G). In most of

have been described as products of a dynamic balance between Kerr self-focusing
and defocusing by free electric charges that are generated via multi-photon
ionization on the beam axis. This established paradigm has been recently
challenged by a suggestion that the Kerr effect saturates and even changes sign
at high intensity of light, and that this sign reversal, not free-charge
defocusing, is the dominant mechanism responsible for the extended propagation
of laser filaments. We report qualitative tests of the new theory based on
electrical and optical measurements of plasma density in femtosecond laser
filaments in air and argon. Our results consistently support the established
paradigm.

Population (SSP) models are unable to describe or explain the colours of
Galactic open clusters both in the visible and in the NIR spectral range. (...)
We construct a numerical SSP-model, with an underlying Salpeter IMF, valid
within an upper $m_u$ and lower $m_l$ stellar mass range, and with total masses
$M_c=10^2...10^4\,m_\odot$ typical of open clusters. We assume that the mass
loss from a cluster is provided by mass loss from evolved stars and by the
dynamical evaporation of low-mass members due to two-body relaxation. The data
for the latter process were scaled to the models from high-resolution N-body
calculations. We also investigate how a change of the $m_l$-limit influences
magnitudes and colours of clusters of a given mass and derive a necessary
condition for a luminosity and colour flash. The discreteness of the IMF leads
to bursts in magnitude and colour of model clusters at moments when red
supergiants or giants appear and then die. The amplitude of the burst depends
on the cluster mass and on the spectral range; it is strongly increased in the
NIR compared to optical passbands. In the discrete case, variations of the
parameter $m_l$ are able to substantially change the magnitude-age and
$M/L$-age relations. For the colours, the lowering of $m_l$ considerably
amplifies the discreteness effect. The influence of dynamical mass loss on
colour and magnitude is weak, although it provides a change of the slopes of
the considered relations, improving their agreement with observations. For the
Galactic open clusters we determined luminosity and tidal mass independent of
each other. The derived mass-to-luminosity ratio shows, on average, an increase
with cluster age in the optical, but gradually declines with age in the NIR.
The observed flash statistics can be used to constrain $m_l$ in open clusters.

of particular interest for fusion reactor design due to the presence of WC in

calculations to study the hydrogen behavior in WC. The most stable interstitial
site for the hydrogen atom is the projection of the octahedral interstitial
site on tungsten basal plane, followed by the site near the projection of the
octahedral interstitial site on carbon basal plane. The binding energy between
two interstitial hydrogen atoms is negative, suggesting that hydrogen itself is
not capable of trapping other hydrogen atoms to form a hydrogen molecule. The
calculated results on the interaction between hydrogen and vacancy indicate
that the hydrogen atom is energetically trapped by vacancy and the hydrogen
molecule can not be formed in mono-vacancy. In addition, the hydrogen atom
bound to carbon is only found in tungsten vacancy. We also study the migrations
of hydrogen in WC and find that the interstitial hydrogen atom prefers to
diffusion along the c axis. Our studies on the hydrogen behavior in WC provide
some explanations for the experimental results of the thermal desorption
process of energetic hydrogen ion implanted into WC.

properties of the entropy production, are studied using various approaches. We
begin by deriving a tight lower bound on the variance of the entropy production
for a given mean of this random variable. It is shown that the Evans-Searles
fluctuation theorem alone imposes a significant lower bound on the variance
only when the mean entropy production is very small. It is then nonetheless
demonstrated that upon incorporating additional information concerning the
entropy production, this lower bound can be significantly improved, so as to
capture extensivity properties. Another important aspect of the fluctuation
properties of the entropy production is the relationship between the mean and
the variance, on the one hand, and the probability of the event where the
entropy production is negative, on the other hand. Accordingly, we derive upper
and lower bounds on this probability in terms of the mean and the variance.
These bounds are tighter than previous bounds that can be found in the
literature. Moreover, they are tight in the sense that there exist probability
distributions, satisfying the Evans-Searles fluctuation theorem, that achieve
them with equality. Finally, we present a general method for generating a wide
class of inequalities that must be satisfied by the entropy production. We use
this method to derive several new inequalities which go beyond the standard
derivation of the second law.

parabolic subgroups. Interestingly, the above geometry finds its natural
counterparts in the representation theory as the branching rules and transfer
principle in the context of the reciprocity algebra. The last half of the paper
establishes this connection.

statistics in the context of meta-analysis aimed to estimate the number of
unpublished studies in meta-analyses required to bring the meta-analytic mean
effect size down to a statistically insignificant level. Already before
Scargle's (2000) and Schonemann & Scargle's (2008) fundamental critique on the
claimed stability of the basic rationale of the FSN approach, objections
focusing on the basic assumption of the FSN which treats the number of studies
as unbiased with averaging null were expressed throughout the history of the
FSN by different authors (Elashoff, 1978; Iyengar & Greenhouse, 1988a; 1988b;
see also Scargle, 2000). In particular, Elashoff's objection appears to be
important because it was the very first critique pointing directly to the
central problem of the FSN: ""R & R claim that the number of studies hidden in
the drawers would have to be 65,000 to achieve a mean effect size of zero when
combined with the 345 studies reviewed here. But surely, if we allowed the
hidden studies to be negative, on the average no more than 345 hidden studies
would be necessary to obtain a zero mean effect size"" (p. 392). Thus, users of
meta-analysis could have been aware right from the beginning that something was
wrong with the statistical reasoning of the FSN. In particular, from an applied
research perspective, it is therefore of interest whether any of the
fundamental objections on the FSN are reflected in standard handbooks on
meta-analysis as well as -and of course even more importantly- in meta-analytic
studies itself.

symmetry can form long-lived loops called kinky vortons from random initial
conditions in the broken field and a uniform charged background in (2+1)
dimensions. In this paper we investigate a similar model with a hyper-cubic
symmetry coupled to an unbroken U(1) in which the domain walls can form
junctions and hence a lattice. We call this model the charge-coupled
cubic-anisotropy (CCCA) model. First, we present a detailed parametric study of
the U(1) x Z2 model; features which we vary include the nature of the initial
conditions and the coupling constants. This allows us to identify interesting
parameters to vary in the more complicated, and hence more computationally
intensive, CCCA models. In particular we find that the coefficient of the
interaction term can be used to engineer three separate regimes: phase mixing,
condensation and phase separation with the condensation regime corresponding to
a single value of the coupling constant defined by the determinant of the
quartic interaction terms being zero. We then identify the condensation regime
in the CCCA model and show that, in this regime, the number of domain walls
does not scale in the standard way if the initial conditions have a
sufficiently high background charge. Instead of forming loops of domain wall,
we find that, within the constraints of dynamic range, the network appears to
be moving toward a glass-like configuration. We find that the results are
independent of the dimension of the hyper-cube.

that they are all equivalent to the axiomatic definition. This is achieved by
defining generalised n-dimensional intrinsic simulation, which brings the

shortlived particles, $D^\pm$, $D^0$, $\bar{D}{}^0$, $D_s^\pm$, $\Lambda^+_c$,

because of poor explored processes of the charm production. Besides, an
ambiguity in high-energy behavior of pion and especially kaon production cross
sections for nucleon-nucleus collisions may affect essentially the calculated
neutrino flux. There is the energy region where above flux uncertainties
superimpose. A new calculation presented here reveals sizable differences, up
to the factor of 1.8 above 1 TeV, in muon neutrino flux predictions obtained
with usage of known hadronic models, SIBYLL 2.1 and QGSJET-II. The atmospheric
neutrino flux in the energy range $10-10^7$ GeV was computed within the 1D
approach to solve nuclear cascade equations in the atmosphere, which takes into
account non-scaling behavior of the inclusive cross-sections for the particle
production, the rise of total inelastic hadron-nucleus cross-sections and
nonpower-law character of the primary cosmic ray spectrum. This approach was
recently tested in the atmospheric muon flux calculations [1]. The results of

linked to the fermion number transformation. Under the condition that the
definition of this symmetry in arbitrary weak basis does not depend upon Higgs
parameters such as ratio of vacuum expectation values, a class of two Higgs
doublet models (2HDM) can be identified in which tree level flavor changing
neutral currents normally present in 2HDM are absent. However unlike the type I
or type II Higgs doublet models, the charged Higgs couplings in these models
contain additional flavor dependent CP violating phases. These phases can
account for the recent hints of the beyond standard model CP violation in the
$B_d$ and $B_s$ mixing. In particular, there is a range of parameters in which
new phases do not contribute to the $K$ meson CP violation but give identical
new physics phases in the $B_d$ and $B_s$ meson mixing.

carried out using both the Gim2D and Galfit codes. We provide the following
parameters: Galaxy ID, RA, DEC, the total corrected automatic magnitude from

geometric mean effective radius Re, the mean surface brightness within the
effective radius <{\mu}>_e, the S\'ersic index n, the ellipticity and the
source position angle. The selection limits of the catalogue and the errors
listed for the S\'ersic parameters come from extensive simulations of the

covered in the catalogue. We define and present two goodness-of-fit indices

explained by a spherical expansion in a non-homogeneous medium. Two models are
analyzed: an exponential and an inverse power law dependence for the density as
a function of distance from the equatorial plane. The presence of a medium with
variable density along the polar direction progressively converts the original
spherical shell into a bipolar nebula. In the case of the nebula around
$\eta$-Carinae, we know the time elapsed since the great outburst in 1840. An
exact match between observed radii and velocities can be obtained by fine
tuning the parameters involved, such as initial radius, initial velocity and
the typical scale that characterizes the gradient in density. The observed
radius and velocity of the Homunculus as a function of the polar angle in
spherical coordinates can be compared with the corresponding simulated data by
introducing the efficiency in a single or multiple directions. Once the 3D
spatial structure of the Homunculus is obtained, we can compose the image by
integrating along the line of sight. In order to simulate the observed image,
we have considered a bipolar nebula with constant thickness and an optically
thin emitting layer. Some simulated cuts of the relative intensity are reported

transaction data streams, none of these solve the problem of finding similar
pairs according to standard similarity measures. This paper is a first attempt
at dealing with this, arguably more important, problem. We start out with a
negative result that also explains the lack of theoretical upper bounds on the
space usage of data mining algorithms for finding frequent itemsets: Any
algorithm that (even only approximately and with a chance of error) finds the
most frequent k-itemset must use space Omega(min{mb,n^k,(mb/phi)^k}) bits,
where mb is the number of items in the stream so far, n is the number of
distinct items and phi is a support threshold. To achieve any non-trivial space
upper bound we must thus abandon a worst-case assumption on the data stream. We
work under the model that the transactions come in random order, and show that
surprisingly, not only is small-space similarity mining possible for the most
common similarity measures, but the mining accuracy improves with the length of
the stream for any fixed support threshold.

pion, the eta and eta-prime) which are governed by the chiral anomaly. Some of
these decays are of special interest because their study permits a deep insight
into aspects of modern physics. The decays can be classified according to the
type of the anomaly (triangle or box) that governs the corresponding amplitude
when it is extrapolated to the chiral point. In order to take the momentum
dependencies of the form factors into account, the actual calculations are
performed in the frame work of vector meson dominance (VMD) models, namely in
terms of the original hidden gauge model and modern generalized models. The
results of the triangle-anomaly sector show that the hidden gauge model and the
modern modifications can describe the data equally well. In the box-anomaly
sector the data have a slight preference to the modern modified VMD
formulation. The results of the latter also agree very well with the
predictions of unitarized chiral perturbation theory. In the case of the
box-anomaly decays, we especially analyze the contributions of an
unconventional untested CP-violating electric dipole form factor that is
sensitive to the strange-quark/antiquark-content of the eta and eta-prime
mesons. We verify the claim that it could still be of natural size by comparing
with the new KLOE data for eta-> pi+ pi- e+ e-.

detected as point-like sources with gamma-ray telescopes at TeV energies [1]
[2]. It has been claimed that these detections show that the cosmic ray
intensity in the starburst galaxies is three orders of magnitude higher than in
the Milky Way galaxy, assuming that the observed gamma rays arise due to pion
production of cosmic rays interacting with the ambient gas. The observed
spectrum is flatter than the cosmic ray spectrum in the Milky Way galaxy, and
this could be due to the much higher gas density in the starburst galaxies [3].
The interpretation seems to be in line with the Ginzburg-model of the origin of
cosmic rays according to which the cosmic rays are accelerated in the shells of
supernova remnants. As an immediate corollary it follows that the cosmic ray
driven gamma ray luminosity should scale with the gas density and supernova
rate. At lower energies, gamma-ray measurements with the Fermi LAT instrument
could provide support for this scaling [4]. However, there are nagging doubts
about the interpretation of the observations at very high energies. At the
distance of the observed galaxies, point-like sources cannot be discriminated
from diffuse emission for an angular resolution of the order of 0.1 deg. Hence,
the question about the contribution of unresolved point-like sources to the
gamma-ray luminosity arises.

steps: the metrizable case, and the passage from the metrizable case to the

metrizable locally equiconnected spaces are algebraic ANRs is rather difficult,
we give here a detaled sketch of it in the case of a compact convex subset of a

of the Broad-Line Radio Galaxy (BLRG), 3C 445. A 200ks Chandra LETG observation
of 3C 445 reveals the presence of several highly ionized emission lines in the
soft X-ray spectrum, primarily from the He and H-like ions of O, Ne, Mg and Si.
Radiative recombination emission is detected from O VII and O VIII, indicating
that the emitting gas is photoionized. The He-like emission appears to be
resolved into forbidden and intercombination line components, which implies a
high density of >10^{10} cm^{-3}, while the Oxygen lines are velocity broadened
with a mean width of ~2600 km s^{-1} (FWHM). The density and widths of the
ionized lines indicate an origin of the gas on sub-parsec scales in the Broad
Line Region (BLR).The X-ray continuum of 3C 445 is heavily obscured either by a
partial coverer or by a photoionized absorber of column density N_{H}=2x10^{23}
cm^{-2} and ionization parameter log(xi)=1.4 erg cm s^{-1}. However the view of
the X-ray line emission is unobscured, which requires the absorber to be
located at radii well within any parsec scale molecular torus. Instead, we
suggest that the X-ray absorber in 3C 445 may be associated with an outflowing,
but clumpy, accretion disk wind with an observed outflow velocity of ~10000
km/s.

wide variety of physical, chemical, biological and engineering systems. These
mixed-mode oscillations (MMOs) are often found in systems with multiple time
scales. Previous differential equation modeling and analysis of MMOs has mainly
focused on local mechanisms to explain the small oscillations. Numerical
continuation studies reported different MMO patterns based on parameter
variation. This paper aims at improving the link between local analysis and
numerical simulation. Our starting point is a numerical study of a singular
return map for the Koper model which is a prototypical example for MMOs that
also relates to local normal form theory. We demonstrate that many MMO patterns
can be understood geometrically by approximating the singular maps with affine
and quadratic maps. Motivated by our numerical analysis we use abstract affine
and quadratic return map models in combination with two local normal forms that
generate small oscillations. Using this decomposition approach we can reproduce
many classical MMO patterns and effectively decouple bifurcation parameters for
local and global parts of the flow. The overall strategy we employ provides an
alternative technique for understanding MMOs.

the quantisation of Parametrised Field Theory (PFT) in the kind of
discontinuous representations that are employed in Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG).
In one spatial dimension (circle) PFT is very similar to the closed bosonic
string and the constraint algebra is isomorphic to two mutually commuting Witt
algebras. Its quantisation is therefore straightforward in LQG like
representations which by design lead to non anomalous, unitary, albeit
discontinuous representations of the spatial diffeomorphism group. In
particular, the complete set of (distributional) solutions to the quantum
constraints, a preferred and complete algebra of Dirac observables and the
associated physical inner product has been constructed. On the other hand, the
two copies of Witt algebras are classically isomorphic to the Dirac or
hypersurface deformation algebra of General Relativity (although without
structure functions). The question we address in this paper, also raised by
Laddha and Varadarajan in their paper, is whether we can quantise the Dirac
algebra in such a way that its space of distributional solutions coincides with
the one just described. This potentially teaches us something about LQG where a
classically equivalent formulation of the Dirac algebra in terms of spatial
diffeomorphism Lie algebras is not at our disposal. We find that, in order to
achieve this, the Hamiltonian constraint has to be quantised by methods that
extend those previously considered. The amount of quantisation ambiguities is
somewhat reduced but not eliminated. We also show that the algebra of
Hamiltonian constraints closes in a precise sense, with soft anomalies, that
is, anomalies that do not cause inconsistencies. We elaborate on the relevance
of these findings for full LQG.
