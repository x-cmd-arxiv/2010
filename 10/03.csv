space-time foam (D-foam) may induce oscillations and mixing among flavoured
particles. As a result, rather than the mass-eigenstate vacuum, the correct
ground state to describe the underlying dynamics is the flavour vacuum,
proposed some time ago by Blasone and Vitiello as a description of quantum
field theories with mixing. At the microscopic level, the breaking of
target-space supersymmetry is induced in our space-time foam model by the
relative transverse motion of brane defects. Motivated by these results, we
show that the flavour vacuum, introduced through an inequivalent representation
of the canonical (anti-) commutation relations, provides a vehicle for the
breaking of supersymmetry (SUSY) at a low-energy effective field theory level;
on considering the flavour-vacuum expectation value of the energy-momentum
tensor and comparing with the form of a perfect relativistic fluid, it is found
that the bosonic sector contributes as dark energy while the fermion
contribution is like dust. This indicates a strong and novel breaking of SUSY,
of a non-perturbative nature, which may characterize the low energy field
theory of certain quantum gravity models.

further construct projective k-subvarieties of the multigraded Hilbert scheme

for any reduced k-algebra R these morphisms induce bijective maps between the

high-mass X-ray binaries -- consisting of an OB star plus compact companion --
that have recently been observed by Fermi and ground-based Cerenkov telescopes
like HESS to be sources of very high energy (VHE; up to 30 TeV) gamma-rays.
This paper focuses on the prominent gamma-ray source, LS5039, which consists of
a massive O6.5V star in a 3.9-day-period, mildly elliptical (e = 0.24) orbit
with its companion, assumed here to be a black-hole or unmagnetized neutron
star. Using 3-D SPH simulations of the Bondi-Hoyle accretion of the O-star wind
onto the companion, we find that the orbital phase variation of the accretion
follows very closely the simple Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) rate for the local
radius and wind speed. Moreover, a simple model, wherein intrinsic emission of
gamma-rays is assumed to track this accretion rate, reproduces quite well Fermi
observations of the phase variation of gamma-rays in the energy range 0.1-10
GeV. However for the VHE (0.1-30 TeV) radiation observed by the HESS Cerenkov
telescope, it is important to account also for photon-photon interactions
between the gamma-rays and the stellar optical/UV radiation, which effectively
attenuates much of the strong emission near periastron. When this is included,
we find that this simple BHL accretion model also quite naturally fits the HESS
light curve, thus making it a strong alternative to the pulsar-wind-shock
models commonly invoked to explain such VHE gamma-ray emission in massive-star
binaries.

analysis on the magnitude, redshift, and colour distributions of galaxies, as
well as their clustering properties. We constructed 100 quasi-independent mock
catalogues, using the output of the semi-analytical model presented in De Lucia
& Blaizot (2007).We then applied the same observational selection function of
the VVDS-Deep survey, so as to carry out a fair comparison between models and
observations. We find that the semi-analytical model reproduces well the
magnitude counts in the optical bands. It tends, however, to overpredict the
abundance of faint red galaxies, in particular in the i' and z' bands. Model
galaxies exhibit a colour bimodality that is only in qualitative agreement with
the data. In particular, we find that the model tends to overpredict the number
of red galaxies at low redshift and of blue galaxies at all redshifts probed by
VVDS-Deep observations, although a large fraction of the bluest observed
galaxies is absent from the model. In addition, the model overpredicts by about
14 per cent the number of galaxies observed at 0.2<z<1 with I_AB<24. When
comparing the galaxy clustering properties, we find that model galaxies are
more strongly clustered than observed ones at all redshift from z=0.2 to z=2,
with the difference being less significant above z~1. When splitting the
samples into red and blue galaxies, we find that the observed clustering of
blue galaxies is well reproduced by the model, while red model galaxies are
much more clustered than observed ones, being principally responsible for the
strong global clustering found in the model. [abridged]

importance for nanotechnology, but has not yet been measured experimentally.
Theoretical estimates based on simplified (1D) models predict anomalously high

we have developed a 3D coarse-grained (CG) model that retains the realism of
the full all-atom description, but is significantly more efficient. Within the
proposed model each nucleotide is represented by 6 particles or grains; the
grains interact via effective potentials inferred from classical molecular
dynamics (MD) trajectories based on a well-established all-atom potential
function. Comparisons of 10 ns long MD trajectories between the CG and the
corresponding all-atom model show similar root-mean-square deviations from the
canonical B-form DNA, and similar structural fluctuations. At the same time,
the CG model is 10 to 100 times faster depending on the length of the DNA
fragment in the simulation. Analysis of dispersion curves derived from the CG
model yields longitudinal sound velocity and torsional stiffness in close
agreement with existing experiments. The computational efficiency of the CG
model makes it possible to calculate thermal conductivity of a single DNA
molecule not yet available experimentally. For a uniform (polyG-polyC) DNA, the
estimated conductivity coefficient is 0.3 W/mK which is half the value of
thermal conductivity for water. This result is in stark contrast with estimates
of thermal conductivity for simplified, effectively 1D chains (""beads on a
spring"") that predict anomalous (infinite) thermal conductivity. Thus, full 3D
character of DNA double-helix retained in the proposed model appears to be
essential for describing its thermal properties at a single molecule level.

All Landau levels but N=0 are four times degenerate counting spin and valley

fact that orbitals $n=0$ and $n=1$ both have zero kinetic energies. At integer
filling factors, Coulomb interactions produce a set of broken-symmetry states
with partial or full alignement in space of the valley and orbital pseudospins.
These quantum Hall pseudo-ferromagnetic states support topological charged
excitations in the form of orbital and valley Skyrmions. Away from integer
fillings, these topological excitations can condense to form a rich variety of
Skyrme crystals with interesting properties. We study in this paper different
crystal phases that occur when an electric field is applied between the layers.
We show that orbital Skyrmions, in analogy with spin Skyrmions, have a texture

reconnections enhance energy loss from the moving vortex by a factor of up to
100 beyond that with no mesh. The enhancement occurs through two different
mechanisms, both involving the Kelvin oscillations generated along the vortex
by the reconnections. At relatively high temperatures the Kelvin waves increase
the vortex motion, leading to more energy loss through mutual friction. As the
temperature decreases, the vortex oscillations generate additional reconnection
events between the moving vortex and the wall, which decrease the energy of the
moving vortex by transfering portions of its length to the pinned mesh on the
wall.

the SU(2) singlet neutrinos of $10^5-10^8$ GeV. However, conventional SL
(unflavoured) requires an unnaturally small soft supersymmetry(SUSY)-breaking
bilinear $B \ll \mathcal{O}({\rm TeV})$ coupling for successful leptogenesis.
On the other hand, in this regime, the interactions mediated by $\tau$, $\mu$
(and even $e$) charged lepton Yukawa interactions are in equilibrium, making
the lepton number asymmetries and the washouts flavour dependent. Hence, it is
crucial to take into account the flavour effects. Considering a general soft
SUSY-breaking trilinear $A$ couplings, it is possible to enhance the efficiency
up to $\mathcal{O}(1000)$ compared to the unflavoured case. With the enhanced
efficiency, we can raise the $B$ up to TeV scale for successful leptogenesis.
Taking into account the low energy constraints, we verify that the fast lepton
flavour violation processes induced by the soft SUSY-breaking slepton masses
would not destroy the enhancement.

noise, can induce novel phenotypes. If an induced phenotype confers a fitness
advantage, selection may promote its genetic stabilization. Non-genetic
perturbations can thus initiate evolutionary innovation. Genetic variation that
is not usually phenotypically visible may play an important role in this
process. Populations under stabilizing selection on a phenotype that is robust
to mutations can accumulate such variation. After non-genetic perturbations,
this variation can become a source of new phenotypes. We here study the
relationship between a phenotype's robustness to mutations and a population's
potential to generate novel phenotypic variation. To this end, we use a
well-studied model of transcriptional regulation circuits. Such circuits are
important in many evolutionary innovations. We find that phenotypic robustness
promotes phenotypic variability in response to non-genetic perturbations, but
not in response to mutation. Our work suggests that non-genetic perturbations
may initiate innovation more frequently in mutationally robust gene expression
traits.

absorption, emissivity reduction, and local suppression. The coefficients of
these power-reduction mechanisms can be determined by comparing time-distance
cross-covariances obtained from sunspots and from the quiet Sun. By analyzing
47 active regions observed by SOHO/MDI without using signal filters, we have
determined the coefficients of surface absorption, deep absorption, emissivity
reduction, and local suppression. The dissipation in the quiet Sun is derived
as well. All of the cross-covariances are width corrected to offset the effect
of dispersion. We find that absorption is the dominant mechanism of the power
deficit in sunspots for short travel distances, but gradually drops to zero at
travel distances longer than about 6 degrees. The absorption in sunspot
interiors is also significant. The emissivity-reduction coefficient ranges from
about 0.44 to 1.00 within the umbra and 0.29 to 0.72 in the sunspot, and
accounts for only about 21.5% of the umbra's and 16.5% of the sunspot's total
power reduction. Local suppression is nearly constant as a function of travel
distance with values of 0.80 and 0.665 for umbrae and whole sunspots

attracted interest since SIP is being widely deployed in the Next Generation
Networks (NGN) as a core signaling protocol. Yet all existing SIP overload
control work is focused on SIP-over-UDP, despite the fact that TCP is
increasingly seen as the more viable choice of SIP transport. This paper
answers the following questions: is the existing TCP flow control capable of
handling the SIP overload problem? If not, why and how can we make it work? We
provide a comprehensive explanation of the default SIP-over-TCP overload
behavior through server instrumentation. We also propose and implement novel
but simple overload control algorithms without any kernel or protocol level
modification. Experimental evaluation shows that with our mechanism the
overload performance improves from its original zero throughput to nearly full
capacity. Our work leads to the important general insight that the traditional
notion of TCP flow control alone is incapable of managing overload for
time-critical session-based applications, which would be applicable not only to
SIP, but also to a wide range of other common applications such as database
servers.

classical optics theory from the research in quantum optics, or vice-versa. We
can not only find some new quantum mechanical unitary operators which
correspond to the known optical transformations, deriving a new theorem for
calculating quantum tomogram of density operators, but also can reveal some new
classical optical transformations. We derive GFO's normal product form and its
canonical coherent state representation and find that GFO is the loyal

wavelet are studied in the context of quantum optics too. Throughout our

its inherent sensitivity to proton resonance frequency offset. We have recently

measurement which is found to be insensitive to proton offsets over wide range.
In this presentation, we report the first implementation of the sequence on
rigid systems. Experiments were done on a single crystal of N-Acetyl DL-Valine
(NAV). Dipolar couplings measured from the 2D DAPT spectrum is used for
identifying the orientations of the magnetically in-equivalent molecules in the
unit cell. SLF spectrum of NAV is complicated due to the presence of two
magnetically in-equivalent molecules in the unit cell and with pairs of
splitting for each C(alpha) - 1H and C(beta) - 1H. The molecular orientation
has been identified by incorporating the crystal coordinates and constructing a
three dimensional rotation matrix about an arbitrary axis using Rodrigues'
rotation formula with the aid of a MATLAB program. Dipolar couplings measured
from the spectrum is used for all the calculations. The algorithm proposed here
is simple and hence can be easily accessible for various other studies aimed

that the real additive de Rham cohomology structure of the manifold in question
is completely determined by $\Lambda$. This shows that the DN map $\Lambda$
inscribes into the list of objects of algebraic topology. In this paper, we
suppose $G$ is a torus acting by isometries on $M$. Given $X$ in the Lie
algebra of $G$ and the corresponding vector field $X_M$ on $M$, one defines
Witten's inhomogeneous coboundary operator $d_{X_M} = d+\iota_{X_M}$ on
invariant forms on $M$. The main purpose is to adapt Belishev and
Sharafutdinov's boundary data to invariant forms in terms of the operator
$d_{X_M}$ and its adjoint $\delta_{X_M}$. In other words, we define an operator
$\Lambda_{X_M}$ on invariant forms on the boundary which we call the $X_M$-DN
map and using this we recover the long exact $X_M$-cohomology sequence of the
topological pair $(M,\partial M)$ from an isomorphism with the long exact
sequence formed from our boundary data. We then show that $\Lambda_{X_M}$
completely determines the free part of the relative and absolute equivariant
cohomology groups of $M$ when the set of zeros of the corresponding vector
field $X_M$ is equal to the fixed point set $F$ for the $G$-action. In
addition, we partially determine the mixed cup product (the ring structure) of
$X_M$-cohomology groups from $\Lambda_{X_M}$. These results explain to what
extent the equivariant topology of the manifold in question is determined by
the $X_M$-DN map $\Lambda_{X_M}$. Finally, we illustrate the connection between

high energies, the energetic particles must be able to interact with magnetic
turbulence over a broad wavelength range. The weakly anisotropic distribution
of accelerated particles, i.e., cosmic rays (CRs), is believed capable of
producing this turbulence in a symbiotic relationship where the magnetic
turbulence required to accelerate the CRs is created by the accelerated CRs
themselves. In efficient DSA, this wave-particle interaction can be strongly
nonlinear where CRs modify the plasma flow and the specific mechanisms of
magnetic field amplification. Resonant interactions have long been known to
amplify magnetic fluctuations on the scale of the CR gyroradius, and Bell
(2004) showed that the CR current can efficiently amplify magnetic fluctuations
with scales smaller than the CR gyroradius. Here, we show with a multi-scale,
quasi-linear analysis that the presence of turbulence with scales shorter than
the CR gyroradius enhances the growth of modes with scales longer than the
gyroradius, at least for particular polarizations. We use a mean-field approach
to average the equation of motion and the induction equation over the ensemble
of magnetic field oscillations accounting for the anisotropy of relativistic
particles on the background plasma. We derive the response of the magnetized CR
current on magnetic field fluctuations and show that, in the presence of
short-scale, Bell-type turbulence, long wavelength modes are amplified. The
polarization, helicity, and angular dependence of the growth rates are
calculated for obliquely propagating modes for wavelengths both below and above
the CR mean free path. The long wavelength growth rates we estimate for typical
supernova remnant parameters are sufficiently fast to suggest a fundamental

to a too large average velocity probably due to the biased choice of the CME
events. In order to estimate the overall influence of the projection effects on
the kinematic properties of the CMEs, we perform a forward modeling of the real
distributions of the CME properties, such as the velocity, the angular width,
and the latitude, by requiring their projected distributions to best match the
observations. Such a matching is conducted by Monte Carlo simulations.
According to the derived real distributions, it is found that (1) the average
real velocity of all non-full-halo CMEs is about 514 km s$^{-1}$, and the
average real angular width is about 33$^\circ$, in contrast to the
corresponding apparent values of 418 km s$^{-1}$ and 42.7$^\circ$ in
observations; (2) For the CMEs with the angular width in the range of
$20^\circ- 120^\circ$, the average real velocity is 510 km s$^{-1}$ and the
average real angular width is 43.4$^\circ$, in contrast to the corresponding
apparent values of 392 km s$^{-1}$ and 52$^\circ$ in observations.

globalization and recessions over the last 40 years. We show that by treating
the world trade network as an evolving system, theory predicts the trade
network is more sensitive to evolutionary shocks and recovers more slowly from
them now than it did 40 years ago, due to structural changes in the world trade
network induced by globalization. We also show that recession-induced change to
the world trade network leads to an \emph{increased} hierarchical structure of
the global trade network for a few years after the recession.

with a function and understanding the associated norm, and in the inverse
sense, starting with the norm and deducing properties of the function. Instead
of focusing on the norms themselves, we study associated dual norms and dual
functions. Combining this study with a variant of the Szemeredi Regularity
Lemma, we give a decomposition theorem for dual functions, linking the dual
norms to classical norms and indicating that the dual norm is easier to
understand than the norm itself. Using the dual functions, we introduce higher
order algebras that are analogs of the classical Fourier algebra, which in turn
can be used to further characterize the dual functions.

large excesses of r-process elements. This star is one of two newly discovered
cool subdwarfs (effective temperatures of 5000 K) with extremely low
metallicity ([Fe/H]<-3) identified from follow-up high-resolution spectroscopy
of metal-poor candidates from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. SDSS J2357-0052 has
[Fe/H]=-3.4 and [Eu/Fe]=+1.9, and exhibits a scaled solar r-process abundance
pattern of heavy neutron-capture elements. This is the first example of an
extremely metal-poor, main-sequence star showing large excesses of r-process
elements; all previous examples of the large r-process-enhancement phenomena
have been associated with metal-poor giants. The metallicity of this object is
the lowest, and the excess of Eu ([Eu/Fe]) is the highest, among the
r-process-enhanced stars found so far. We consider possible scenarios to
account for the detection of such a star, and discuss techniques to enable
searches for similar stars in the future.

area. Currently, most of the image segmentation algorithms are designed based
on the idea that images are partitioned into a set of regions preserving
homogeneous intra-regions and inhomogeneous inter-regions. However, human
visual intuition does not always follow this pattern. A new image segmentation
method named Visual-Hint Boundary to Segment (VHBS) is introduced, which is
more consistent with human perceptions. VHBS abides by two visual hint rules
based on human perceptions: (i) the global scale boundaries tend to be the real
boundaries of the objects; (ii) two adjacent regions with quite different
colors or textures tend to result in the real boundaries between them. It has
been demonstrated by experiments that, compared with traditional image
segmentation method, VHBS has better performance and also preserves higher
computational efficiency.
