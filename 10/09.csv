  SO(3)",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper provides new results for a tracking control of the attitude
dynamics of a rigid body. Both of the attitude dynamics and the proposed
control system are globally expressed on the special orthogonal group, to avoid
complexities and ambiguities associated with other attitude representations
such as Euler angles or quaternions. By selecting an attitude error function
carefully, we show that the proposed control system guarantees a desirable
tracking performance uniformly for nontrivial rotational maneuvers involving a
large initial attitude error. In a special case where the desired attitude
command is fixed, we also show that the attitude dynamics can be stabilized
without the knowledge of an inertia matrix. These are illustrated by numerical
examples.

calculated using the hyperspherical quantum reactive scattering method
developed by Launay et al. [Chem. Phys. Lett. 169, 473 (1990)]. Short-range
interactions, described using the {\em ab initio} potential energy surface by
Ho et al. were complemented with an accurate description of the long-range
interactions, where the main electrostatic (~R^{-5}) and dispersion (~ R^{-6})
contributions were considered. This allows the comparison with recent
experimental measurements of rate constants and excitation functions for the
title reaction at low temperatures [Berteloite et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 2010].
The agreement is fairly good. The behavior in the considered energy range can
be understood on the average in terms of a classical Langevin (capture) model,
where the centrifugal barriers determine the amount of reactive flux which
reaches the barrierless transition state. Additionally, the structure of the
van der Waals well provides temporal trapping at short distances thus allowing
the system to find its way to the reaction at some classically-forbidden
energies. Interestingly, the cross-section for para-hydrogen shows clearly
oscillating features associated to the opening of new partial waves and to
shape resonances which may be amenable to experimental detection.

performing new two-dimensional and general-relativistic simulations onto a

oscillations (QPOs) are naturally produced in the shock cone that develops in
the downstream part of the flow. Because the shock cone in the downstream part
of the flow acts as a cavity trapping pressure perturbations, modes with
frequencies in the integer ratios 2:1 and 3:1 are easily produced. The
frequencies of these modes depend on the black-hole spin and on the properties
of the flow, and scale linearly with the inverse of the black-hole mass. Our
results may be relevant for explaining the detection of QPOs in Sagittarius A*,
once such detection is confirmed by further observations. Finally, we report on
the development of the flip-flop instability, which can affect the shock cone
under suitable conditions; such an instability has been discussed before in
Newtonian simulations but was never found in a relativistic regime.

states. In this paper we present a lower bound for squashed entanglement in
terms of a distance to the set of separable states. This implies that squashed
entanglement is faithful, that is, strictly positive if and only if the state
is entangled. We derive the bound on squashed entanglement from a bound on
quantum conditional mutual information, which is used to define squashed
entanglement and corresponds to the amount by which strong subadditivity of von
Neumann entropy fails to be saturated. Our result therefore sheds light on the
structure of states that almost satisfy strong subadditivity with equality. The
proof is based on two recent results from quantum information theory: the
operational interpretation of the quantum mutual information as the optimal
rate for state redistribution and the interpretation of the regularised
relative entropy of entanglement as an error exponent in hypothesis testing.
The distance to the set of separable states is measured by the one-way LOCC
norm, an operationally-motivated norm giving the optimal probability of
distinguishing two bipartite quantum states, each shared by two parties, using
any protocol formed by local quantum operations and one-directional classical
communication between the parties. A similar result for the Frobenius or
Euclidean norm follows immediately. The result has two applications in
complexity theory. The first is a quasipolynomial-time algorithm solving the
weak membership problem for the set of separable states in one-way LOCC or
Euclidean norm. The second concerns quantum Merlin-Arthur games. Here we show
that multiple provers are not more powerful than a single prover when the
verifier is restricted to one-way LOCC operations thereby providing a new
characterisation of the complexity class QMA.

  Path","40 pages",,,,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Semimartingale reflecting Brownian motions (SRBMs) are diffusion processes
with state space the d-dimensional nonnegative orthant, in the interior of
which the processes evolve according to a Brownian motion, and that reflect
against the boundary in a specified manner. The data for such a process are a
drift vector {\theta}, a nonsingular d \times d covariance matrix {\Sigma}, and
a d \times d reflection matrix R. A standard problem is to determine under what
conditions the process is positive recurrent. Necessary and sufficient
conditions for positive recurrence are easy to formulate for d = 2, but not for
d > 2.
  Associated with the pair ({\theta}, R) are fluid paths, which are solutions
of deterministic equations corresponding to the random equations of the SRBM. A
standard result of Dupuis and Williams [6] states that when every fluid path
associated with the SRBM is attracted to the origin, the SRBM is positive
recurrent. Employing this result, El Kharroubi et al. [7, 8] gave sufficient
conditions on ({\theta},{\Sigma},R) for positive recurrence for d = 3; Bramson
et al. [2] showed that these conditions are, in fact, necessary.
  Relatively little is known about the recurrence behavior of SRBMs for d > 3.
This pertains, in particular, to necessary conditions for positive recurrence.
Here, we provide a family of examples, in d = 6, with {\theta} = (-1, -1, . >.
., -1)T, {\Sigma} = I and appropriate R, that are positive recurrent, but for
which a linear fluid path diverges to infinity. These examples show in
particular that, for d >= 6, the converse of the Dupuis-Williams result does
not hold.

transit. After extracting light curves in independent wavelength channels, we
use a linear decorrelation technique account for instrumental systematics
(which is becoming standard in the field), and measure the planet-to-star
radius ratio as a function of wavelength. For HD 189733, the uncertainties in
the transmission spectrum are significantly larger than those previously
reported. We also find the transmission spectrum is considerably altered when
using different out-of-transit orbits to remove the systematics, when some
parameters are left out of the decorrelation procedure, or when we perform the
decorrelation with quadratic functions rather than linear functions. Given that
there is no physical reason to believe the baseline flux should be modelled as
a linear function of any particular set of parameters, we interpret this as
evidence that the linear decorrelation technique is not a robust method to
remove systematic effects from the light curves for each wavelength channel.
For XO-1, the parameters measured to decorrelate the light curves would require
extrapolation to the in-transit orbit to remove the systematics, and we cannot
reproduce the previously reported results. We conclude that the resulting
NICMOS transmission spectra are too dependent on the method used to remove
systematics to be considered robust detections of molecular species in
planetary atmospheres, although the presence of these molecules is not ruled
out.

coordinates and morphology of the torus-like pulsar wind nebula in X-rays. The
source is not visible in 24 and 70 micron images, which are dominated by bright
emission from the remnant shell and filaments. We compiled the infrared fluxes
of the nebula, which probably contains a contribution from an unresolved pulsar
in its center, with the optical and X-ray data. The resulting unabsorbed
multiwavelength spectrum is described by power laws of significantly steeper
slope in the infrared-optical than in X-rays, implying a double-knee spectral
break between the optical and X-rays. The 24 and 70 microns flux upper limits
suggest a second break and a flatter spectrum at the long wavelength limit.

functions parametrized by a single shape parameter beta that takes the
Euclidean distance, the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the Itakura-Saito
divergence as special cases (beta = 2,1,0, respectively). The proposed
algorithms are based on a surrogate auxiliary function (a local majorization of
the criterion function). We first describe a majorization-minimization (MM)
algorithm that leads to multiplicative updates, which differ from standard
heuristic multiplicative updates by a beta-dependent power exponent. The
monotonicity of the heuristic algorithm can however be proven for beta in (0,1)
using the proposed auxiliary function. Then we introduce the concept of
majorization-equalization (ME) algorithm which produces updates that move along
constant level sets of the auxiliary function and lead to larger steps than MM.
Simulations on synthetic and real data illustrate the faster convergence of the
ME approach. The paper also describes how the proposed algorithms can be
adapted to two common variants of NMF : penalized NMF (i.e., when a penalty
function of the factors is added to the criterion function) and convex-NMF
(when the dictionary is assumed to belong to a known subspace).

polynomial with integer coefficients using (variants of) the continued fraction
algorithm (CF). We introduce a novel way to compute a lower bound on the
positive real roots of univariate polynomials. This allows us to derive a worst
case bound of $\sOB(d^6 + d^4\tau^2 + d^3\tau^2)$ for isolating the real roots
of a polynomial with integer coefficients using the classic variant of CF,
where $d$ is the degree of the polynomial and $\tau$ the maximum bitsize of its
coefficients. This improves the previous bound by Sharma \cite{sharma-tcs-2008}
by a factor of $d^3$ and matches the bound derived by Mehlhorn and Ray
\cite{mr-jsc-2009} for another variant of CF; it also matches the worst case
bound of the subdivision-based solvers. We present a new variant of CF, we call
it iCF, that isolates the real roots of a polynomial with integer coefficients
in $\sOB(d^5+d^4\tau)$, thus improving the current known bound for the problem
by a factor of $d$. If the polynomial has only real roots, then our bound
becomes $\sOB(d^4+d^3\tau+ d^2\tau^2)$, thus matching the bound of the
numerical algorithms by Reif \cite{r-focs-1993} and by Ben-Or and Tiwari
\cite{bt-joc-1990}. Actually the latter bound holds in a more general setting,
that is under the rather mild assumption that $\Omega(d/\lg^c{d})$, where
$c\geq 0$ is a constant, roots contribute to the sign variations of the
coefficient list of the polynomial. This is the only bound on exact algorithms
that matches the one of the numerical algorithms by Pan \cite{Pan02jsc} and

estimate that for gas-phase compounds these values increase one order of

demonstrated that the excess free energy density of the inhomogeneous SHS fluid
$\Phi_{\text{SHS}}$ is uniquely defined when (a) it is solely a function of the
weighted densities from Kierlik and Rosinberg's version of FMT [Phys. Rev. A

generalized Percus-Yevick closures introduced by Gazzillo and Giacometti [J.

good agreement with simulation data. In particular, this FMT yields the correct
contact value of the density profiles with no adjustable parameters. Rather
than requiring higher order DCFs, such as perturbative DFTs, our SHS FMT
produces them. Interestingly, although equivalent to Kierlik and Rosinberg's
FMT in the case of hard spheres, the set of weighted densities used for
Rosenfeld's original FMT is insufficient for constructing a DFT which yields
the SHS DCF.

The dependence of spin torque on bias is important for understanding

previous techniques have provided only indirect measures of the torque and
their results to date for the bias dependence are qualitatively and
quantitatively inconsistent. Here we demonstrate that spin torque in MTJs can
be measured directly by using time-domain techniques to detect resonant
magnetic precession in response to an oscillating spin torque. The technique is
accurate in the high-bias regime relevant for applications, and because it
detects directly small-angle linear-response magnetic dynamics caused by spin
torque it is relatively immune to artifacts affecting competing techniques. At
high bias we find that the spin torque vector differs markedly from the simple
lowest-order Taylor series approximations commonly assumed.

extension of Fierz-Pauli massive gravity obtained recently in arXiv:1007.0443.
In this limit the theory is a scalar-tensor model of a unique form defined by
symmetries. We find that it admits a self-accelerated solution, with the Hubble
parameter set by the graviton mass. The negative pressure causing the
acceleration is due to a condensate of the helicity-0 component of the massive
graviton, and the background evolution, in the approximation used, is
indistinguishable from the \Lambda CDM model. Fluctuations about the
self-accelerated background are stable for a certain range of parameters
involved. Most surprisingly, the fluctuation of the helicity-0 field above its
background decouples from an arbitrary source in the linearized theory. We also
show how massive gravity can remarkably screen an arbitrarily large
cosmological constant in the decoupling limit, while evading issues with
ghosts. The obtained static solution is stable against small perturbations,
suggesting that the degravitation of the vacuum energy is possible in the full
theory. Interestingly, however, this mechanism postpones the Vainshtein effect
to shorter distance scales. Hence, fifth force measurements severely constrain
the value of the cosmological constant that can be neutralized, making this
scheme phenomenologically not viable for solving the old cosmological constant
problem. We briefly speculate on a possible way out of this issue.

high-ionisation fine structure line emission indicative of a hard radiation

young stellar population. The selection of HG031203 via the presence of a GRB

demonstrated recently, and provides a suitable system to characterize, model
and control Ge crystal growth on non-crystalline substrates. Direct observation
of Ge transfer to the surface of Al through an interposed GeOx interfacial
layer allows independent measurement of the density and average area of
crystalline Ge islands formed on the surface. Based on these experimental
observations, the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kologoromov phase transformation theory
is extended to model nanoscale nucleation and growth of Ge islands in two
dimensions. The Ge island growth mechanism switches from
atomic-attachment-limited to surface diffusion-limited kinetics with increasing
time. The transition point between these regimes depends on the Ge nucleation
site density and the annealing temperature. Finally, we show that local
bias-voltage stressing of the interfacial layer controls the areal density of
nucleated Ge islands on the film surface.

larger than that of previous studies based on classical HII regions. The
distance ambiguity of the kinematic distances, when it exists, is solved by
different procedures, including the latitude distribution and an analysis of
the longitude-velocity diagram. The well defined spiral arms are seen to be
confined inside the co-rotation radius, as is often the case in spiral
galaxies. We identify a square-shaped sub-structure in the CS map with that
predicted by stellar orbits at the 4:1 resonance (4 epicycle oscillations in
one turn around the galactic center). The sub-structure is found at the
expected radius, based on the known pattern rotation speed and epicycle
frequency curve. An inner arm presents an end with strong inward curvature and
intense star formation that we tentatively associate with the region where this
arm surrounds the extremity of the bar, as seen in many barred galaxies.
Finally, a new arm with concave curvature is found in the Sagitta to Cepheus

fact is that black holes in four and higher dimensions always possess a set

important class of microwave components employed in applications like the
measurement of mesoscopic circuits at cryogenic temperatures. The measurement
protocols usually involve an amplification chain which relies on circulators to
separate input and output channels and to suppress backaction from different
stages on the sample under test. In these devices the usual reciprocal symmetry
of circuits is broken by the phenomenon of Faraday rotation based on magnetic
materials and fields. However, magnets are averse to on-chip integration, and
magnetic fields are deleterious to delicate superconducting devices. Here we
present a new proposal combining two stages of parametric modulation emulating
the action of a circulator. It is devoid of magnetic components and suitable
for on-chip integration. As the design is free of any dissipative elements and
based on reversible operation, the device operates noiselessly, giving it an
important advantage over other nonreciprocal active devices for quantum
information processing applications.

from large deviation theory, we quantify the resulting prediction diversity
gain to establish that the decay rate of the outage event probabilities
increases linearly with the prediction duration T. This model is then
generalized to incorporate the effect of prediction errors and the randomness
in the prediction lookahead time T. Remarkably, we also show that, in the
cognitive networking scenario, the appropriate use of proactive resource
allocation by the primary users results in more spectral opportunities for the
secondary users at a marginal, or no, cost in the primary network outage.
Finally, we conclude by a discussion of the new research questions posed under

conditions, nature of the ionization, and chemical abundances of the ionized

of some regions within [HL90] 111. Two contiguous spaxels show an unambiguous
detection of the broad He II 4686 emission line, this feature seems to be
produced by a single WNL star. We also report a probable N and He enrichment in
the precise spaxels where the WR features are detected. The enrichment pattern
is roughly consistent with that expected for the pollution of the ejecta of a
single or a very small number of WR stars. Furthermore, this chemical pollution
is very localized (~2""~7.8 pc) and it should be difficult to detect in
star-forming galaxies beyond the Local Volume. We also discuss the use of the
most-common empirical calibrations to estimate the oxygen abundances of the
ionized gas in nearby galaxies from 2D spectroscopic data. The ionization
degree of the gas plays an important role when applying these empirical
methods, as they tend to give lower oxygen abundances with increasing

heterogeneous nucleation, for example, around suspended colloids. In the latter

result, the planetary signal at the peak of this light curve was observed by 20

the dynamical system dX/dt = X^2 where X is a matrix of the friendliness or

suggested that only two types of behavior were possible for this system: either
all relationships become friendly, or two hostile factions emerge. Here we
prove that for generic initial conditions, these are indeed the only possible
outcomes. Our analysis yields a closed-form expression for faction membership
as a function of the initial conditions, and implies that the initial amount of
friendliness in large social networks (started from random initial conditions)
determines whether they will end up in intractable conflict or global harmony.

presence of constants of motion for the covariance matrix elements. In the case

describing a transition between the shape of a yield surface typical of a class

fundamental key to model the behaviour of materials which become cohesive
during hardening (so that the shape of the yield surface evolves from that
typical of a granular material to that typical of a dense material), or which
decrease cohesion due to damage accumulation. The proposed yield function is
shown to agree with a variety of experimental data relative to soil, concrete,
rock, metallic and composite powders, metallic foams, porous metals, and
polymers. The yield function represents a single, convex and smooth surface in
stress space approaching as limit situations well-known criteria and the
extreme limits of convexity in the deviatoric plane. The yield function is
therefore a generalization of several criteria, including von Mises,
Drucker-Prager, Tresca, modified Tresca, Coulomb-Mohr, modified Cam-clay, and
--concerning the deviatoric section-- Rankine and Ottosen. Convexity of the
function is proved by developing two general propositions relating convexity of

propositions are general and therefore may be employed to generate other convex

Top-down parsers have the great advantage of having a certain predictive power
during the parsing, which takes place in a left-to-right reading of the
sentence. Such parsers have already been well-implemented and studied in the
case of Context-Free Grammars, which are already top-down, but these are
difficult to adapt to Minimalist Grammars, which generate sentences bottom-up.
I propose here a way of rewriting Minimalist Grammars as Linear Context-Free
Rewriting Systems, allowing to easily create a top-down parser. This rewriting
allows also to put a probabilistic field on these grammars, which can be used
to accelerate the parser. Finally, I propose a method of refining the
probabilistic field by using algorithms used in data compression.

material becomes increasingly cohesive as the applied pressure increases. A
constitutive description of this process faces the formidable problem that
granular and dense materials have completely different mechanical behaviours
(nonlinear elastic properties, yield limit, plastic flow and hardening laws),
which must both be, in a sense, included in the formulation. A treatment of
this problem is provided here, so that a new phenomenological, elastoplastic
constitutive model is formulated, calibrated by experimental data, implemented
and tested, that is capable of describing the transition between granular and
fully dense states of a given material. The formulation involves a novel use of
elastoplastic coupling to describe the dependence of cohesion and elastic
properties on the plastic strain. The treatment falls within small strain
theory, which is thought to be appropriate in several situations; however, a
generalization of the model to large strain is provided in Part II of this

are the progressive gain in cohesion and the increase of elastic stiffness,
both related to the development of plastic deformation. The latter effect is an
example of `elastoplastic coupling', in which the plastic flow affects the
elastic properties of the material, and has been so far considered only within
the framework of small strain assumption (mainly to describe elastic
degradation in rock-like materials), so that it remains completely unexplored
for large strain. Therefore, a new finite strain generalization of
elastoplastic coupling theory is given to describe the mechanical behaviour of
materials evolving from a granular to a dense state. The correct account of
elastoplastic coupling and of the specific characteristics of materials
evolving from a loose to a dense state (for instance, nonlinear --or linear--
dependence of the elastic part of the deformation on the forming pressure in
the granular --or dense-- state) makes the use of existing large strain
formulations awkward, if even possible. Therfore, first, we have resorted to a
very general setting allowing general transformations between work-conjugate
stress and strain measures; second, we have introduced the multiplicative
decomposition of the deformation gradient and, third, employing isotropy and
hyperelasticity of elastic response, we have obtained a relation between the
Biot stress and its `total' and `plastic' work-conjugate strain measure. This
is a key result, since it allows an immediate achievement of the rate
elastoplastic constitutive equations. Knowing the general form of these
equations, all the specific laws governing the behaviour of ceramic powders are
finally introduced as generalizations of the small strain counterparts given in
Part I of this paper.

some dynamically growing disturbance, its mechanical meaning has to date still
eluded a precise interpretation. This is provided here by constructing the
infinite-body, time-harmonic Green's function for the loading branch of an
elastoplastic material in flutter conditions. Used as a perturbation, it
reveals that flutter corresponds to a spatially blowing-up disturbance,
exhibiting well-defined directional properties, determined by the wave
directions for which the eigenvalues become complex conjugate. Flutter is shown
to be connected to the formation of localized deformations, a dynamical
phenomenon sharing geometrical similarities with the well-known mechanism of
shear banding occurring under quasi-static loading. Flutter may occur much
earlier than shear banding in a process of continued plastic deformation.

deep Hubble Space Telescope/Advanced Camera for Surveys imaging of nearby dwarf

select Blue Helium Burning stars (BHeBs), which can be unambiguously age-dated
by comparing the absolute magnitude of individual stars with stellar
isochrones. Additionally, we select a very young (<10 Myr) population of OB
stars for a subset of the galaxies based on the tip of the young main-sequence.
By selecting stars in different age ranges we can then study how the spatial
distribution of these stars evolves with time. We find, in agreement with
previous studies, that stars are born within galaxies with a high degree of
substructure which is made up of a continuous distribution of clusters, groups
and associations from parsec to hundreds of parsec scales. These structures
disperse on timescales of tens to hundreds of Myr, which we quantify using the
two-point correlation function and the Q-parameter developed by Cartwright &
Whitworth (2004). On galactic scales, we can place lower limits on the time it
takes to remove the original structure (i.e., structure survives for at least
this long), tevo, which varies between ~100~Myr (NGC~2366) and ~350 Myr
(DDO~165). This is similar to what we have found previously for the SMC

growing through competitive accretion. MCs are formed by the turbulent cascade
in the interstellar medium at scales L from 100 down to ~0.1 pc. Their internal
turbulence is essentially supersonic and creates clumps with a lognormal
distribution of densities n. Our model is based on the assumption of a
power-law relationship between clump mass and clump density: n~m^x, where x is
a scale-free parameter. Gravitationally unstable clumps are assumed to undergo
isothermal fragmentation and produce protostellar cores with a lognormal mass
distribution, centred around the clump Jeans mass. Masses of individual cores
are then assumed to grow further through competitive accretion until the rest
of the gas within the clump is being exhausted. The observed IMF is best
reproduced for a choice of x=0.25, for a characteristic star formation
timescale of ~5 Myr, and for a low star formation efficiency of ~10 %.

a standard tool for studying how efficiently a measurement matrix acquires
information about sparse and compressible signals. Many recovery algorithms are
known to succeed when the restricted isometry constants of the sampling matrix
are small. Many potential applications of compressed sensing involve a
data-acquisition process that proceeds by convolution with a random pulse
followed by (nonrandom) subsampling. At present, the theoretical analysis of
this measurement technique is lacking. This paper demonstrates that the $s$th
order restricted isometry constant is small when the number $m$ of samples
satisfies $m \gtrsim (s \log n)^{3/2}$, where $n$ is the length of the pulse.
This bound improves on previous estimates, which exhibit quadratic scaling.

a very natural way. This paper studies the weighted norm convergence of the

the weights, in terms of the $A_p$ classes of Muckenhoupt, which ensure the
convergence. Necessary conditions are also proved, which for a wide class of
weights coincide with the sufficient conditions.

microscope. It is designed as a compact cold-finger that fits inside the bore
of a superconducting magnet, and which is a modular unit that can be easily
swapped between use in a dilution refrigerator and other cryostats. We aimed at
application in quantum optical experiments with electron spins in
semiconductors and the design has been optimized for driving with, and
detection of optical fields with well-defined polarizations. This was
implemented with optical access via a polarization maintaining fiber together
with Voigt geometry at the cold finger, which circumvents Faraday rotations in
the optical components in high magnetic fields. Our unit is versatile for use
in experiments that measure photoluminescence, reflection, or transmission, as
we demonstrate with a quantum optical experiment with an ensemble of
donor-bound electrons in a thin GaAs film.

with an ordered set of non-negative reals. HVGs realize a methodology in the
analysis of time series, their degree distribution being a good discriminator
between randomness and chaos [B. Luque, et al., Phys. Rev. E 80 (2009),
046103]. We prove that a graph is an HVG if and only if outerplanar and has a
Hamilton path. Therefore, an HVG is a noncrossing graph, as defined in
algebraic combinatorics [P. Flajolet and M. Noy, Discrete Math., 204 (1999)
203-229]. Our characterization of HVGs implies a linear time recognition
algorithm. Treating ordered sets as words, we characterize subfamilies of HVGs
highlighting various connections with combinatorial statistics and introducing
the notion of a visible pair. With this technique we determine asymptotically
the average number of edges of HVGs.

effective equations of motion for a string with two particles attached to its
ends, along with appropriate boundary conditions. The equations of motion are
the usual Nambu-Goto-like equations, while boundary conditions turn out to be
equations of motion for the particles at the string ends. The form of those
equations is discussed, and they are explicitly solved for a particular case of
a straight-line string rotating around its center. From this solution we obtain
the correction terms to the $J\propto E^2$ law describing Regge trajectories,
due to nonzero angular momenta of the particles.
