repeated cold rolling. By X-ray diffraction it is shown that this leads to
amorphization. TEM investigations reveal that a homogeneously distributed
debris of very small nanocrystals is present in the amorphous matrix that is
not resolved by X-ray diffraction. After heating to 773 K, the crystallization
of the amorphous structure leads to a fully nanocrystalline structure of small
grains (10 - 20 nm in diameter) of the non-equilibrium Zr2Al phase. It is
concluded that the debris retained in the amorphous phase acts as nuclei. After
heating to 973 K the grains grow to about 100 nm in diameter and the compound
Zr3Al starts to form, that is corresponding to the alloy composition.

known from published IUE and optical photometric observations, was modeled by a
steady-state accretion \alpha-disc around a white dwarf. Parameters of the
system were derived from time-resolved optical spectral observations in the
bright state that we obtained in Sep. 1998. The radial velocity semi-amplitude
of the white dwarf (33.8 +/- 2.5 km/s) and corresponding mass function (f(M) =
5.5 +/- 1.2 *10^{-4}~ M_sun) were derived from the motion of the emission
components of Balmer lines. The mass ratio q (\approx 0.315) was evaluated from
the fractional period excess of the superhump period over the orbital period
\epsilon (\approx 0.085), and a secondary mass range (0.18 - 0.38 M_sun) was
estimated from the orbital period. Therefore, the white dwarf mass range is
0.57 - 1.2 M_sun and the inclination angle of the system to the line of sight
is 17 - 22.5 degrees. The adopted distance to the system is 335 +/- 50 pc. To
fit the observed SED it is necessary to add a thermal spectrum with T \approx
11600 K and luminosity \approx 0.4 L_disk to the accretion disc spectrum. This
combined spectrum successfully describes the observed Balmer lines absorption
components. Formally the best fit of the HeI 4471 line gives minimum masses of
the components (M_RD = 0.18 M_sun and M_WD = 0.57 M_sun), with the
corresponding inclination angle i = 22.1 deg and mass-accretion rate \dot M =
2.6 * 10^{17} g/s.

coronagraph measurements have provided some insight into their kinematics near
the Sun ($<$32~R$_\odot$), it is still unclear what forces govern their
evolution during both their early acceleration and later propagation. Here, we
use the dual perspectives of the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory
(STEREO) spacecrafts to derive the three-dimensional kinematics of CMEs over a
range of heliocentric distances ($\sim$2--250\,R$_{\odot}$). We find evidence
for solar wind (SW) drag-forces acting in interplanetary space, with a fast CME
decelerated and a slow CME accelerated towards typical SW velocities. We also
find that the fast CME showed linear ($\delta=1$) dependence on the velocity
difference between the CME and the SW, while the slow CME showed a quadratic
($\delta=2$) dependence. The differing forms of drag for the two CMEs indicate
the forces and thus mechanism responsible for there acceleration may be
different.

applied field. The field required to form SNW decreases rapidly within a few
cycles, or by annealing at 600 C in even fewer cycles, and is stable to 700C.
Here we describe the intrinsic evolution of Si NC and SNW in terms of the
competition between internal stresses and electro-osmosis. The analysis relies
heavily on experimental data from a wide range of thin film studies, and it
explains why a vertical edge across the planar Si-SiOx interface is necessary
to form SNW. The discussion also shows that the formation mechanisms of Si NC

Unfortunately, this benefit of using optical lattices to study Hubbard models

typically nanoKelvin compared with Kelvin in solids, with a correspondingly
miniscule temperature scale required to observe exotic phases such as d-wave
superconductivity. The ultra-low temperatures necessary to reach the regime in

to a so called ratio selection method disclosed in the literature, although
ratio selection has been shown to be optimal, when impractically, the secondary

precursor to possible methods for the nonperturbative solution of quantum
chromodynamics. The electron state is truncated to include at most two photons
and no positrons in the Fock basis, and the wave functions of the dressed state
are used to compute the electrons's anomalous magnetic moment. A choice of
regularization that preserves the chiral symmetry of the massless limit is
critical for the success of the calculation.

observability of Caputo fractional differential linear systems of any real

powers of the matrix of dynamics are first obtained. Sets of linearly
independent continuous functions or matrix functions, which are also Chebyshev

such functions, the controllability and observability of the Caputo fractional
differential system of real order {\alpha} are discussed as related to their
counterpart properties in the corresponding standard system defined for
{\alpha} = 1. Extensions are given to the fulfilment of those properties under
non- uniform sampling. It is proved that the choice of the appropriate sampling

sunspot, in a regime where the wavelength is comparable to the size of the
sunspot. Spatial maps of wave traveltimes and amplitudes are measured from the
cross-covariance function of the random wave field. The averaging procedure is
such that incoming wave packets are plane wave packets. Observations show that
the magnitude of the traveltime perturbation caused by the sunspot diminishes
as waves propagate away from the sunspot -- a finite-wavelength phenomenon
known as wavefront healing. Observations also show a reduction of the amplitude
of the waves after their passage through the sunspot. A significant fraction of
this amplitude reduction is due to the defocusing of wave energy by the fast
wave-speed perturbation introduced by the sunspot. This ``geometrical
attenuation'' will contribute to the wave amplitude reduction in addition to
the physical absorption of waves. In addition, we observe an enhancement of
wave amplitude away from the central path: diffracted rays intersect with
unperturbed rays (caustics) and wavefronts fold and triplicate. Thus we find
that ray tracing is useful to interpret these phenomena, although it cannot
explain wavefront healing.

produced by the feeble interaction mediating between the two sectors, while the

building blocks of rocky planets and gas giant cores. Self-gravity competes
against the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI): gradients in dust content drive
a vertical shear which risks overturning the dusty subdisk and forestalling GI.
To understand the conditions under which the disk can resist the KHI, we
perform 3D simulations of stratified subdisks in the limit that dust particles
are small and aerodynamically well coupled to gas. This limit screens out the
streaming instability and isolates the KHI. Each subdisk is assumed to have a
vertical density profile given by a spatially constant Richardson number Ri. We
vary Ri and the midplane dust-to-gas ratio mu and find that the critical
Richardson number dividing KH-unstable from KH-stable flows is not unique;
rather Ri_crit grows nearly linearly with mu for mu=0.3-10. Only for disks of
bulk solar metallicity is Ri_crit ~ 0.2, close to the classical value. Our
results suggest that a dusty sublayer can gravitationally fragment and
presumably spawn planetesimals if embedded within a solar metallicity gas disk
~4x more massive than the minimum-mass solar nebula; or a minimum-mass disk
having ~3x solar metallicity; or some intermediate combination of these two
possibilities. Gravitational instability seems possible without resorting to
the streaming instability or to turbulent concentration of particles.

scatter about the mean Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) flux-mass relation using a
hydrodynamical simulation of galaxy cluster formation. We examine the
assumption of lognormal scatter and detect non-negligible positive skewness and
kurtosis (> 0.5) for a wide range of limiting masses and redshifts. These
higher-order moments should be included in the parametrization of scatter in
order not to bias cosmological constraints. We investigate the sources of the
scatter by correlating it with measures of cluster morphology, halo
concentration, and dynamical state, and we quantify the individual contribution
from each source. We find that statistically the impact of dynamical state is
weak, so the selection bias due to mergers is negligible. On the other hand,
there is a strong correlation between the scatter and halo concentration, which
can be used to reduce the scatter significantly (from 12.07% to 7.34% or by
~40% for clusters at z = 0). We also show that a cross-calibration by combining
information from X-ray followups can be used to reduce the scatter in the

unstable and fragment into planetesimals if the local dust-to-gas density ratio
mu is sufficiently high. We simulate how dust settles in passive disks and ask
how high mu can become. We settle the dust using a 1D code and test for
dynamical stability using a 3D shearing box code. This scheme allows us to
explore the behavior of small particles having short but non-zero stopping
times in gas: 0 < t_stop << the orbital period. The streaming instability is
thereby filtered out. Dust settles until shearing instabilities in the edges of
the dust layer threaten to overturn the entire layer. In this state of marginal
stability, mu=2.9 for a disk whose bulk (height-integrated) metallicity is
solar. For a disk whose bulk metallicity is 4x solar, mu reaches 26.4. These
maximum values of mu, which depend on the background radial pressure gradient,
are so large that gravitational instability of small particles is viable in
disks whose bulk metallicities are just a few (<4) times solar. Earlier studies
assumed that dust settles until the Richardson number Ri is spatially constant.
Our simulations are free of this assumption but provide support for it within
the dust layer's edges, with the proviso that Ri increases with bulk
metallicity in the same way that we found in Paper I. Only modest enhancements
in bulk metallicity are needed to spawn planetesimals directly from small
particles.

discovered, with an equivalent mass cooling rate within the central 50 kpc is
approximately 700 solar masses/yr. Unique features observed in the central core
of MACSJ1931.8-2634 hint to a wealth of past activity that has greatly
disrupted the original cool core. We observe a spiral of relatively cool,
dense, X-ray emitting gas connected to the cool core, as well as highly
elongated intracluster light (ICL) surrounding the cD galaxy. Extended radio
emission is observed surrounding the central AGN, elongated in the east-west
direction, spatially coincident with X-ray cavities. The power input required
to inflate these `bubbles' is estimated from both the X-ray and radio emission
to reside between 4 and 14e45 erg/s, putting it among the most powerful jets
ever observed. This combination of a powerful AGN outburst and bulk motion of
the cool core have resulted in two X-ray bright ridges to form to the north and
south of the central AGN at a distance of approximately 25 kpc. The northern
ridge has spectral characteristics typical of cool cores and is consistent with
being a remnant of the cool core after it was disrupted by the AGN and bulk
motions. It is also the site of H-alpha filaments and young stars. The X-ray
spectroscopic cooling rate associated with this ridge is approximately 165
solar masses/yr, which agrees with the estimate of the star formation rate from
broad-band optical imaging (170 solar masses/yr). MACS J1931.8-2634 appears to

relations in general 4-dimensional local field theories with any type of
particles, both massless and massive. Our analysis applies to renormalizable as
well as non-renormalizable interactions, with or without supersymmetry. We
focus on recursion relations that arise from complex deformations of all
external momenta. Under certain conditions, these ""all-line shift recursion
relations"" imply the MHV vertex expansion. We derive a simple sufficient
criterion for the validity of the all-line shift recursion relations. It
depends only on the mass dimensions of the coupling constants and on the sum of
helicities of the external particles. Our proof is strikingly simple since it
just relies on dimensional analysis and little-group transformation properties.
In particular, the results demonstrate that all tree amplitudes with n>4
external states are constructible in any power-counting renormalizable theory.
Aspects of all-line shift constructibility are illustrated in numerous
examples, ranging from pure scalar theory and the massless Wess-Zumino model to
theories with higher-derivative interactions, gluon-Higgs fusion, and Z-boson
scattering. We propose a sharp physical interpretation of our constructibility
criterion: the all-line shift fails precisely for those classes of n-point
amplitudes that can receive local contributions from independent
gauge-invariant n-field operators.

to study bioconvection and cell dispersion in tubes subject to imposed flow. To
optimize light and nutrient uptake, many microorganisms swim in directions
biased by environmental cues (e.g. phototaxis in algae and chemotaxis in
bacteria). Such taxes inevitably lead to accumulations of cells, which, as many
microorganisms have a density different to the fluid, can induce hydrodynamic
instabilites. The large-scale fluid flow and spectacular patterns that arise
are termed bioconvection. However, the extent to which bioconvection is
affected or suppressed by an imposed fluid flow, and how bioconvection
influences the mean flow profile and cell transport are open questions. This
experimental study is the first to address these issues by quantifying the
patterns due to suspensions of the gravitactic and gyrotactic green
biflagellate alga Chlamydomonas in horizontal tubes subject to an imposed flow.
With no flow, the dependence of the dominant pattern wavelength at pattern
onset on cell concentration is established for three different tube diameters.
For small imposed flows, the vertical plumes of cells are observed merely to
bow in the direction of flow. For sufficiently high flow rates, the plumes
progressively fragment into piecewise linear diagonal plumes, unexpectedly
inclined at constant angles and translating at fixed speeds. The pattern
wavelength generally grows with flow rate, with transitions at critical rates
that depend on concentration. Even at high imposed flow rates, bioconvection is
not wholly suppressed and perturbs the flow field.

the entropy increases or stays constant in time in any isolated system, and,
finally, the third law (or Nernst postulate), which states that the entropy of

of the direct consequences of the third law is that the specific heat of any

we show that the third law is violated in a wide class of fermionic systems, by

innovative and large-scale signal processing algorithms, complemented by
collaborative and adaptive sensing platforms to accomplish the objectives of
layered sensing and control. Towards this goal, the present paper develops a
spline-based approach to field estimation, which relies on a basis expansion
model of the field of interest. The model entails known bases, weighted by
generic functions estimated from the field's noisy samples. A novel field
estimator is developed based on a regularized variational least-squares (LS)
criterion that yields finitely-parameterized (function) estimates spanned by
thin-plate splines. Robustness considerations motivate well the adoption of an
overcomplete set of (possibly overlapping) basis functions, while a sparsifying
regularizer augmenting the LS cost endows the estimator with the ability to
select a few of these bases that ``better'' explain the data. This parsimonious
field representation becomes possible, because the sparsity-aware spline-based
method of this paper induces a group-Lasso estimator for the coefficients of
the thin-plate spline expansions per basis. A distributed algorithm is also
developed to obtain the group-Lasso estimator using a network of wireless
sensors, or, using multiple processors to balance the load of a single
computational unit. The novel spline-based approach is motivated by a spectrum
cartography application, in which a set of sensing cognitive radios collaborate
to estimate the distribution of RF power in space and frequency. Simulated
tests corroborate that the estimated power spectrum density atlas yields the
desired RF state awareness, since the maps reveal spatial locations where idle
frequency bands can be reused for transmission, even when fading and shadowing
effects are pronounced.

mixture of H/He and H2O. Within this framework we perform models of the thermal
evolution and contraction of the planet. We discuss possible compositions that
are consistent with Mp=6.55 ME, Rp=2.678 RE, an age tau=3-10 Gyr, and the
irradiation level of the atmosphere. These conditions require that if water
exists in the interior, it must remain in a fluid state, with important
consequences for magnetic field generation. These conditions also require the
atmosphere to have a deep isothermal region extending down to 80-800 bar,
depending on composition. Our results bolster the suggestion of a
metal-enriched H/He atmosphere for the planet, as we find water-world models
that lack an H/He atmosphere to require an implausibly large water-to-rock
ratio of more than 6:1. We instead favor a H/He/H2O envelope with high water
mass fraction (~0.5-0.85), similar to recent models of the deep envelope of
Uranus and Neptune. Even with these high water mass fractions in the H/He
envelope, generally the bulk composition of the planet can have subsolar
water:rock ratios. Dry, water-enriched, and pure water envelope models differ
to an observationally significant level in their tidal Love numbers k2 of
respectively ~0.018, 0.15, and 0.7.

affected by its interactions with other networks. Motivated by failures
cascading among electrical grids, we study the Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld sandpile
model on two sparsely-coupled random regular graphs. By approximating
avalanches (cascades) as a multi-type branching process and using a
generalization of Lagrange's expansion to multiple variables, we calculate the
distribution of avalanche sizes within each network. Due to coupling, large
avalanches in the individual networks are mitigated--in contrast to the
conclusion for a simpler model [36]. Yet when compared to uncoupled networks,
interdependent networks more frequently suffer avalanches that are large in
both networks. Thus sparse connections between networks stabilize them
individually but destabilize them jointly, as coupling introduces reservoirs
for extra load yet also inflicts new stresses. These results suggest that in
practice, to greedily mitigate large avalanches in one network, add connections
between networks; conversely, to mitigate avalanches that are large in both
networks, remove connections between networks. We also show that when only one
network receives load, the largest avalanches in the second network increase in
size and in frequency, an effect that is amplified with increased coupling
between networks and with increased disparity in total capacity. Our framework
is applicable to modular networks as well as to interacting networks and
provides building blocks for better prediction of cascading processes on
networks in general.

plume. The flux can be provided by either heat, a compositional difference
between the fluid comprising the plume and its surroundings, or a combination
of both. For autocatalytic plumes produced by the iodate-arsenous acid
reaction, however, buoyancy is produced along the entire reacting interface
between the plume and its surroundings. Buoyancy production at the moving
interface drives fluid motion, which in turn generates flow that advects the
reaction front. As a consequence of this interplay between fluid flow and
chemical reaction, autocatalytic plumes exhibit a rich dynamics during their
ascent through the reactant medium. One of the more interesting dynamical
features is the production of an accelerating vortical plume head that in
certain cases pinches-off and detaches from the upwelling conduit. After
pinch-off, a new plume head forms in the conduit below, and this can lead to
multiple generations of plume heads for a single plume initiation. We
investigated the pinch-off process using both experimentation and simulation.
Experiments were performed using various concentrations of glycerol, in which
it was found that repeated pinch-off occurs exclusively in a specific
concentration range. Autocatalytic plume simulations revealed that pinch-off is
triggered by the appearance of accelerating flow in the plume conduit.

centralized control with huge complexity. To obtain a distributive and low

value function of the associated Bellman equation by the sum of per-node value
functions. We derive a distributive two-stage two-winner auction-based control
policy which is a function of the local CSI and local QSI only. Furthermore, to
estimate the best fit approximation parameter, we propose a distributive online
stochastic learning algorithm using stochastic approximation theory. Finally,
we establish technical conditions for almost-sure convergence and show that
under heavy traffic, the proposed low complexity distributive control is global

for next-generation experiments trying to detect H I signals from the Epoch of
Reionization and Dark Ages (""21-cm cosmology""). We summarize existing
decametre-wavelength observations of RRLs, which have detected only carbon
RRLs. We then show that, for an interferometric array, the primary instrumental
factor limiting detection and study of the RRLs is the areal filling factor of
the array. We consider the Long Wavelength Array (LWA-1), the LOw Frequency
ARray (LOFAR), the low-frequency component of the Square Kilometre Array
(SKA-lo), and a future Lunar Radio Array (LRA), all of which will operate at
decametre wavelengths. These arrays offer digital signal processing, which
should produce more stable and better defined spectral bandpasses; larger
frequency tuning ranges; and better angular resolution than that of the
previous generation of instruments that have been used in the past for RRL
observations. Detecting Galactic carbon RRLs, with optical depths at the level
of 10^-3, appears feasible for all of these arrays, with integration times of
no more than 100 hr. The SKA-lo and LRA, and the LWA-1 and LOFAR at the lowest
frequencies, should have a high enough filling factor to detect lines with much
lower optical depths, of order 10^-4 in a few hundred hours. The amount of
RRL-hosting gas present in the Galaxy at the high Galactic latitudes likely to
be targeted in 21-cm cosmology studies is currently unknown. If present,
however, the spectral fluctuations from RRLs could be comparable to or exceed

applicable to random vectors of arbitrary and not necessarily equal dimension.
Distance covariance and distance correlation are analogous to product-moment
covariance and correlation, but generalize and extend these classical bivariate
measures of dependence. Distance correlation characterizes independence: it is
zero if and only if the random vectors are independent. The notion of
covariance with respect to a stochastic process is introduced, and it is shown
that population distance covariance coincides with the covariance with respect
to Brownian motion; thus, both can be called Brownian distance covariance. In
the bivariate case, Brownian covariance is the natural extension of
product-moment covariance, as we obtain Pearson product-moment covariance by
replacing the Brownian motion in the definition with identity. The
corresponding statistic has an elegantly simple computing formula. Advantages
of applying Brownian covariance and correlation vs the classical Pearson
covariance and correlation are discussed and illustrated.

should analyze model adequacy from that point of view. We investigate this

designed to serve as a one-number summary measure of model adequacy. We define
the index to be the maximum sample size at which samples from the model and

use standard notions from hypothesis testing to make this definition precise.
We use data subsampling to estimate the index. We show that the definition
leads us to some new ways of viewing models as flawed but useful. The concept

variances of $k$ samples are equal. There are a substantial number of tests for
this problem. Many of them rely on the assumption of normality and are not
robust to its violation. In 1960 Professor Howard Levene proposed a new
approach to this problem by applying the $F$-test to the absolute deviations of
the observations from their group means. Levene's approach is powerful and
robust to nonnormality and became a very popular tool for checking the
homogeneity of variances. This paper reviews the original method proposed by
Levene and subsequent robust modifications. A modification of Levene-type tests

  and FDMA","12 pages, 10 figures",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the two-user Gaussian Strong Interference Channel (GSIC) with finite
constellation inputs, it is known that relative rotation between the
constellations of the two users enlarges the Constellation Constrained (CC)
capacity region. In this paper, a metric for finding the approximate angle of
rotation (with negligibly small error) to maximally enlarge the CC capacity for
the two-user GSIC is presented. In the case of Gaussian input alphabets with
equal powers for both the users and the modulus of both the cross-channel gains
being equal to unity, it is known that the FDMA rate curve touches the capacity
curve of the GSIC. It is shown that, with unequal powers for both the users
also, when the modulus of one of the cross-channel gains being equal to one and
the modulus of the other cross-channel gain being greater than or equal to one,
the FDMA rate curve touches the capacity curve of the GSIC. On the contrary, it
is shown that, under finite constellation inputs, with both the users using the
same constellation, the FDMA rate curve strictly lies within (never touches)
the enlarged CC capacity region throughout the strong-interference regime. This
means that using FDMA it is impossible to go close to the CC capacity. It is
well known that for the Gaussian input alphabets, the FDMA inner-bound, at the
optimum sum-rate point, is always better than the simultaneous-decoding
inner-bound throughout the weak-interference regime. For a portion of the weak
interference regime, it is shown that with identical finite constellation
inputs for both the users, the simultaneous-decoding inner-bound, enlarged by
relative rotation between the constellations, is strictly better than the FDMA
inner-bound.

spacetime with \emph{light-like} noncommutativity. To tackle the issues arising
from noncommuting and hence nonlocal time, we argue that for this case
light-front quantization procedure should be employed. In this appropriate
quantization scheme we perform the non-planar loop analysis for the light-like
noncommutative field theories. One of the important and peculiar features of
light-front quantization is that the UV cutoff of the light-cone Hamiltonian
manifests itself as an IR cutoff for the light-cone momentum, $p^+$. Due to
this feature, the naive results of covariant quantization for the light-like
case allude to the absence of the UV/IR mixing in the light-front quantization.
However, by a careful analysis of non-planar loop integrals we show that this
is not the case and the UV/IR mixing persists. In addition, we argue in favour
of the perturbative unitarity of light-like noncommutative field theories in
the light-front quantization scheme.

Ejections (CMEs) are sometimes interpreted as the white light counterparts of
current sheets (CSs) produced by the eruption. The 3D geometry of these
ray-like features is largely unknown and its knowledge should clarify their
association to the CS and place constraints on CME physics and coronal
conditions. With this study we test these important implications for the first
time. An example of such a post-CME ray was observed by various coronagraphs,
including these of the SECCHI instrument suite of the STEREO twin spacecraft
and the Large Angle Spectrometric Coronagraph LASCO onboard the Solar and
Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). The ray was observed in the aftermath of a CME
which occurred on 9 April 2008. The twin STEREO spacecraft were separated by
about degrees on that day. This significant separation combined with a third
""eye"" view supplied by LASCO allow for a truly multi-viewpoint observation of
the ray and of the CME. We applied 3D forward geometrical modeling to the CME
and to the ray as simultaneously viewed by SECCHI-A and B and by SECCHI-A and
LASCO, respectively. We found that the ray can be approximated by a rectangular
slab, nearly aligned with the CME axis, and much smaller than the CME in both
terms of thickness and depth (~ 0.05 and 0.15 Rsun respectively). We found that
the ray and CME are significantly displaced from the associated post-CME
flaring loops. The properties and location of the ray are fully consistent with
the expectations of the standard CME theories for post-CME current sheets.
Therefore, our multi-viewpoint observations supply strong evidence that the
observed post-CME ray is indeed related to a post-CME current sheet.

Hubble Space Telescope images. The region contains both field stars and cluster
members. Using a classical synthetic CMD procedure applied to the field around
NGC 346 we find that there the star formation pace has been rising from a quite
low rate 13 Gyr ago to \approx 1.4 \times 10^{-8} Mo yr^{-1}pc^{-2} in the last
100 Myr. This value is significantly higher than in other star forming regions
of the SMC. For NGC 346 itself, we compare theoretical and observed
Color-Magnitude Diagrams (CMDs) of several stellar sub-clusters identified in
the region, and we derive their basic evolution parameters. We find that NGC
346 experienced different star formation regimes, including a dominant and
focused ""high density mode"", with the sub-clusters hosting both pre-main
sequence (PMS) and upper main sequence (UMS) stars, and a diffuse ""low density
mode"", as indicated by the presence of low-mass PMS sub-clusters.
Quantitatively, the star formation in the oldest sub-clusters started about 6
Myr ago with remarkable synchronization, it continued at high rate (up to 2
\times 10^{-5} Mo yr^{-1} pc^{-2}) for about 3 Myr and is now progressing at a
lower rate. Interestingly, sub-clusters mainly composed by low mass PMS stars
seem to experience now the first episode of star formation, following
multi-seeded spatial patterns instead of resulting from a coherent trigger. Two
speculative scenarios are put forth to explain the deficiency of UMS stars: the
first invokes under-threshold conditions of the parent gas; the second
speculates that the initial mass function (IMF) is a function of time, with the
youngest sub-clusters not having had sufficient time to form more massive
stars.

far are As-based, by the Hund's rule correlation picture, then examine the
P-based and Sb-based cases, respectively. Consequently, we propose that CaClFeP
with ZrCuSiAs-type structure is an As-free high $T_c$ iron-pnictide. The
subsequent density functional theory calculations show that the ground state of
CaClFeP is of a collinearly antiferromagnetic order on Fe moments with
structural distortion, resulting from the interplay between the strong nearest
and next-nearest neighbor antiferromagnetic superexchange interactions bridged
by P atoms, similar as the As-based pnictides. The other P-based pnictides are
either nonmagnetic or magnetic but with weak exchange interactions. The
Sb-based pnictides unlikely show high $T_c$ superconductivity because of the
existence of robust ferromagnetic order.

$FH$ with kernel $F$ and complement $H$ such that the fixed-point subgroup of
$F$ is trivial: $C_G(F)=1$. In this situation various properties of $G$ are
shown to be close to the corresponding properties of $C_G(H)$. By using
Clifford's theorem it is proved that the order $|G|$ is bounded in terms of
$|H|$ and $|C_G(H)|$, the rank of $G$ is bounded in terms of $|H|$ and the rank
of $C_G(H)$, and that $G$ is nilpotent if $C_G(H)$ is nilpotent. Lie ring
methods are used for bounding the exponent and the nilpotency class of $G$ in
the case of metacyclic $FH$. The exponent of $G$ is bounded in terms of $|FH|$
and the exponent of $C_G(H)$ by using Lazard's Lie algebra associated with the
Jennings--Zassenhaus filtration and its connection with powerful subgroups. The
nilpotency class of $G$ is bounded in terms of $|H|$ and the nilpotency class
of $C_G(H)$ by considering Lie rings with a finite cyclic grading satisfying a
certain `selective nilpotency' condition. The latter technique also yields
similar results bounding the nilpotency class of Lie rings and algebras with a
metacyclic Frobenius group of automorphisms, with corollaries for connected Lie
groups and torsion-free locally nilpotent groups with such groups of
automorphisms. Examples show that such nilpotency results are no longer true
for non-metacyclic Frobenius groups of automorphisms.

operating point in the achievable rate region of a two-user Gaussian
interference channel through bargaining. In previous work, incentive conditions
for two users to cooperate using a simple version of Han-Kobayashi scheme was
studied and the Nash bargaining solution (NBS) was used to obtain a fair
operating point. Here a noncooperative bargaining game of alternating offers is
adopted to model the bargaining process and rates resulting from the
equilibrium outcome are analyzed. In particular, it is shown that the operating
point resulting from the formulated bargaining game depends on the cost of
delay in bargaining and how bargaining proceeds. If the associated bargaining
problem is regular, a unique perfect equilibrium exists and lies on the
individual rational efficient frontier of the achievable rate region. Besides,
the equilibrium outcome approaches the NBS if the bargaining costs of both
users are negligible.

important psychophysical and experimental similarities between the
neurologically different motion parallax and stereopsis cues. Their
quantitative analysis relied primarily on the ""disparity equivalence""
approximation. In this article we show that retinal motion from lateral
translation satisfies a strong (""asymptotic"") approximation to binocular
disparity. This precise mathematical similarity is also practical in the sense
that it applies at normal viewing distances. The approximation is an extension
to peripheral vision of (Cormac & Fox's 1985) well-known non-trig central
vision approximation for binocular disparity. We hope our simple algebraic
formula will be useful in analyzing experiments outside central vision where
less precise approximations have led to a number of quantitative errors in the
vision literature.
