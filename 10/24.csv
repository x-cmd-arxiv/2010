possible by space-borne telescopes. During the half-century history of x-ray
astronomy, the sensitivity of focusing x-ray telescopes-through finer angular
resolution and increased effective area-has improved by a factor of a 100
million. This technological advance has enabled numerous exciting discoveries
and increasingly detailed study of the high-energy universe-including accreting
(stellar-mass and super-massive) black holes, accreting and isolated neutron
stars, pulsar-wind nebulae, shocked plasma in supernova remnants, and hot
thermal plasma in clusters of galaxies. As the largest structures in the
universe, galaxy clusters constitute a unique laboratory for measuring the
gravitational effects of dark matter and of dark energy. Here, we review the
history of high-resolution x-ray telescopes and highlight some of the
scientific results enabled by these telescopes. Next, we describe the planned
next-generation x-ray-astronomy facility-the International X-ray Observatory

very large areas (about 10000 m2) of highly-nested lightweight
grazing-incidence mirrors with exceptional (about 0.1-arcsecond) angular
resolution. Achieving this angular resolution with lightweight mirrors will
likely require on-orbit adjustment of alignment and figure.

  Sparse Modeling","4 pages, 3 figures, submitted to ICASSP 2011",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A collaborative framework for detecting the different sources in mixed
signals is presented in this paper. The approach is based on C-HiLasso, a
convex collaborative hierarchical sparse model, and proceeds as follows. First,
we build a structured dictionary for mixed signals by concatenating a set of
sub-dictionaries, each one of them learned to sparsely model one of a set of
possible classes. Then, the coding of the mixed signal is performed by
efficiently solving a convex optimization problem that combines standard
sparsity with group and collaborative sparsity. The present sources are
identified by looking at the sub-dictionaries automatically selected in the
coding. The collaborative filtering in C-HiLasso takes advantage of the
temporal/spatial redundancy in the mixed signals, letting collections of
samples collaborate in identifying the classes, while allowing individual
samples to have different internal sparse representations. This collaboration
is critical to further stabilize the sparse representation of signals, in
particular the class/sub-dictionary selection. The internal sparsity inside the
sub-dictionaries, as naturally incorporated by the hierarchical aspects of
C-HiLasso, is critical to make the model consistent with the essence of the
sub-dictionaries that have been trained for sparse representation of each
individual class. We present applications from speaker and instrument
identification and texture separation. In the case of audio signals, we use
sparse modeling to describe the short-term power spectrum envelopes of harmonic
sounds. The proposed pitch independent method automatically detects the number
of sources on a recording.

jets from the cores of halo-centered galaxies drive out into the surrounding
cluster gas, forming hotspots of shocked and compressed cluster gas at the jet
extremities. The moving hotspots are sandwiched between two shocks. An
inner-facing shock receives momentum and cosmic rays from the jet and creates
additional cosmic rays that form a radio lobe elongated along the jet axis. An
outer-facing bow shock moves directly into the undisturbed group or cluster
gas, creating a cocoon of shocked gas enclosing the radio lobe. We describe
computations that follow the self-consistent dynamical evolution of the shocked
cluster gas and the relativistic synchrotron-emitting gas inside the lobes.
Relativistic and non-relativistic components exchange momentum by interacting
with small magnetic fields having dynamically negligible energy densities. The
evolution of Cygnus A is governed almost entirely by cosmic ray energy flowing
from the hotspots. Mass flowing into hotspots from the jets is assumed to be
small, greatly reducing the mass of gas flowing back along the jet, common in
previous calculations, that would disrupt the spatial segregation of
synchrotron-loss ages observed inside FR II radio lobes. We compute the
evolution of the cocoon when the velocity and cosmic ray luminosity of the
hotspots are constant and when they vary with time. If cosmic rays mix with
cluster gas in hotspots before flowing into the radio lobe, the thermal gas is
heated to mildly relativistic temperatures, producing an unobserved pressure
inside the lobe.

lattice, we explore how energy transfer efficiency along with the photon
capturing ability depends on network connectivity, on transfer rates, and on
volume fractions - the numbers and relative ratio of fluorescence chromophore
components, e.g., donor (D), acceptor (A), and bridge (B) chromophores. For a
one-dimensional AD array, the exact analytical expression for efficiency shows
a steep increase with a D-to-A transfer rate when a spontaneous decay is
sufficiently slow. This result implies that the introduction of B chromophores
can be a useful method for improving efficiency for a two-component AD system
with inefficient D-to-A transfer and slow spontaneous decay. Analysis of this
one-dimensional system can be extended to higher-dimensional systems with
chromophores arranged in structures such as a helical or stacked-disk rod,
which models the self-assembling monomers of the tobacco mosaic virus coat
protein. For the stacked-disk rod, we observe the following: (1) With spacings
between sites fixed, a staggered conformation is more efficient than an
eclipsed conformation. (2) For a given ratio of A and D chromophores, the
uniform distribution of acceptors that minimizes the mean first passage time to
acceptors is a key point to designing the optimal network for a donor-acceptor
system with a relatively small D-to-A transfer rate. (3) For a three-component
ABD system with a large B-to-A transfer rate, a key design strategy is to
increase the number of the pathways in accordance with the directional energy
flow from D to B to A chromophores.

this difference in behavior is result of the origin of the panic-inducing
volatility shock: the more correlated across stocks the shock is, the more the
kurtosis will decrease; the more idiosyncratic the shock, the lesser this
effect and kurtosis is positively correlated with dispersion. We also find that
there is a leverage effect for correlations: negative returns tend to precede
an increase in correlations. A stock price feed-back model with skew in

amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) relaying strategies are

pairing over multiple hops can be decomposed into independent pairing problems
at each relay, and a sorted-SNR channel pairing strategy is sum-rate optimal,
where each relay pairs its incoming and outgoing channels by their SNR order.
For the joint optimization of channel pairing and power allocation under both
total and individual power constraints, we show that the problem can be
decoupled into two subproblems solved separately. This separation principle is
established by observing the equivalence between sorting SNRs and sorting
channel gains in the jointly optimal solution. It significantly reduces the
computational complexity in finding the jointly optimal solution. It follows
that the channel pairing problem in joint optimization can be again decomposed
into independent pairing problems at each relay based on sorted channel gains.
The solution for optimizing power allocation for DF relaying is also provided,
as well as an asymptotically optimal solution for AF relaying. Numerical
results are provided to demonstrate substantial performance gain of the jointly
optimal solution over some suboptimal alternatives. It is also observed that
more gain is obtained from optimal channel pairing than optimal power
allocation through judiciously exploiting the variation among multiple
channels. Impact of the variation of channel gain, the number of channels, and
the number of hops on the performance gain is also studied through numerical
examples.

  figures and some discussion removed from previous version for brevity",,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many densely packed suspensions and colloids exhibit a behavior known as
Discontinuous Shear Thickening in which the shear stress jumps dramatically and
reversibly as the shear rate is increased. We performed rheometry and video
microscopy measurements on a variety of suspensions to determine the mechanism
for this behavior. Shear profiles and normal stress measurements indicate that,
in the shear thickening regime, stresses are transmitted through frictional
rather than viscous interactions, and come to the surprising conclusion that
the local constitutive relation between stress and shear rate is not
necessarily shear thickening. If the suspended particles are heavy enough to
settle we find the onset stress of shear thickening tau_min corresponds to a
hydrostatic pressure from the weight of the particle packing where neighboring
particles begin to shear relative to each other. Above tau_min, dilation is
seen to cause particles to penetrate the liquid-air interface of the sheared
sample. The upper stress boundary tau_max of the shear thickening regime is
shown to roughly match the ratio of surface tension divided by a radius of
curvature on the order of the particle size. These results suggest a new model
in which the increased dissipation in the shear thickening regime comes from
frictional stresses that emerge as dilation is frustrated by a confining stress
from surface tension at the liquid-air interface. When instead the suspensions
are confined by solid walls and have no liquid-air interface, we find tau_max
is set by the stiffness of the most compliant boundary which frustrates
dilation. This rheology can be described by a non-local constitutive relation
in which the local relation between stress and shear rate is shear thinning,
but where the stress increase comes from a normal stress term which depends on
the global dilation.

longest-standing and intriguing puzzles of solar physics and astrophysics.
Sunspots are controlled by subsurface dynamics hidden from direct observations.
Recently, substantial progress in our understanding of the physics of the
turbulent magnetized plasma in strong-field regions has been made by using
numerical simulations and local helioseismology. Both the simulations and
helioseismic measurements are extremely challenging, but it becomes clear that
the key to understanding the enigma of sunspots is a synergy between models and
observations. Recent observations and radiative MHD numerical models have
provided a convincing explanation to the Evershed flows in sunspot penumbrae.
Also, they lead to the understanding of sunspots as self-organized magnetic
structures in the turbulent plasma of the upper convection zone, which are
maintained by a large-scale dynamics. Local helioseismic diagnostics of
sunspots still have many uncertainties, some of which are discussed in this
review. However, there have been significant achievements in resolving these
uncertainties, verifying the basic results by new high-resolution observations,
testing the helioseismic techniques by numerical simulations, and comparing
results obtained by different methods. For instance, a recent analysis of
helioseismology data from the Hinode space mission has successfully resolved
several uncertainties and concerns (such as the inclined-field and phase-speed
filtering effects) that might affect the inferences of the subsurface
wave-speed structure of sunspots and the flow pattern. It becomes clear that
for the understanding of the phenomenon of sunspots it is important to further
improve the helioseismology methods and investigate the whole life cycle of
active regions, from magnetic-flux emergence to dissipation.

within MCs depends on the ambient physical conditions. MCs, over a free-fall
time are exposed to numerous dynamical phenomena, of which, the interaction
with a thin, dense shell of gas is but one. Below we present results from
self-gravitating, 3-D smoothed particle hydrodynamics ({\small SPH})
simulations of the problem; seven realisations of the problem have been
performed by varying the precollision density within the cloud, the nature of
the post-collision shock, and the spatial resolution in the computational
domain. Irrespective of the type of shock, a complex network of dense
filaments, seeded by numerical noise, readily appears in the shocked cloud.
Segregation of the dense and rarefied gas phases also manifests itself in a
bimodal distribution of gas density. We demonstrate that the power-spectrum for
rarefied gas is Kolomogorov like, while that for the denser gas is considerably
steeper. As a corollary to the main problem, we also look into the possibly
degenerative effect of the {\small SPH} artificial viscosity on the impact of
the incident shell. It is observed that stronger viscosity leads to greater
post-shock dissipation, that strongly decelerates the incident shock-front and
promotes formation of contiguous structure, albeit on a much longer timescale.
We conclude that too much viscosity is likely to enhance the proclivity towards
gravitational boundedness of structure, leading to unphysical fragmentation.On
the other hand, insufficient resolution appears to suppress fragmentation.
Convergence of results is tested at both extremes, first by repeating the test
case with more than a million particles and then with only half the number of
particles in the original test case.

theoretical computer science to economy, from marketing hype to educational
curriculum and from R&D lab to enterprise IT infrastructure. Yet, the currently
developing state of cloud computing leaves several issues to address and also
affects cloud computing adoption by organizations. In this paper, we explain
how the transition into the cloud can occur in an organization and describe the
mechanism for transforming legacy infrastructure into a virtual
infrastructure-based cloud. We describe the state of the art of infrastructural
cloud, which is essential in the decision making on cloud adoption, and
highlight the challenges that can limit the scale and speed of the adoption. We
then suggest a strategic framework for designing a high performance cloud
system. This framework is applicable when transformation cloudbased deployment
model collides with some constraints. We give an example of the implementation
of the framework in a design of a budget-constrained high availability cloud
system.

  report",,,,"cs.LO cs.FL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we focus on some aspects related to modeling and formal
verification of embedded systems. Many models have been proposed to represent
embedded systems. These models encompass a broad range of styles,
characteristics, and application domains and include the extensions of finite
state machines, data flow graphs, communication processes and Petri nets. In
this report, we have used a PRES+ model (Petri net based Representation for
Embedded Systems) as an extension of classical Petri net model that captures
concurrency, timing behaviour of embedded systems; it allows systems to be
representative in different levels of abstraction and improves expressiveness
by allowing the token to carry information. Modeling using PRES+, as discussed
above, may be convenient for specifying the input behaviour because it supports
concurrency. However, there is no equivalence checking method reported in the
literature for PRES+ models to the best of our knowledge. In contrast,
equivalence checking of FSMD models exist. As a first step, therefore, we seek
to devise an algorithm to translate PRES+ models to FSMD models and we seek to
hand execute our algorithm on a real life example and we have to translate two
versions of PRES+ models to FSMD models. Then using existing equivalence
checker we have checked the equivalence between two FSMD models.

binary system. We particularly aimed at detecting periodic variability which
might be associated with pulsations or interactions between both components. We
also searched for variations related to the orbital cycle which could help to
constrain the inclination and the morphology of the binary system. A
Fourier-based prewhitening and a multiperiodic fitting procedure were applied
to analyse the time series and extract the frequencies of variations. We
describe the noise properties to tentatively define an appropriate significance
criterion, to only point out the peaks at a certain significance level. We also
detect the variations related to the orbital motion and study them by using the
NIGHTFALL program. The periodogram exhibits a majority of peaks at low
frequencies. Among these peaks, we highlight a list of about 43 values,
including notably two different sets of harmonic frequencies whose fundamental
peaks are located at about 0.07 and 0.82d-1. The former represents the orbital
frequency of the binary system whilst the latter could probably be associated
with non-radial pulsations. The study of the 0.07d-1 variations reveals the
presence of a hot spot most probably situated on the primary star and facing
the secondary. The investigation of this unique dataset constitutes a further
step in the understanding of Plaskett's Star. These results provide a first
basis for future seismic modelling. The existence of a hot region between both
components renders the determination of the inclination ambiguous.

five-dimensional anti-de Sitter space and confining field theories in physical
space-time, provides a remarkable semiclassical model for hadron physics.
Light-front holography allows hadronic amplitudes in the AdS fifth dimension to
be mapped to frame-independent light-front wavefunctions of hadrons in physical
space-time. The result is a single-variable light-front Schrodinger equation
which determines the eigenspectrum and the light-front wavefunctions of hadrons
for general spin and orbital angular momentum. The coordinate z in AdS space is
uniquely identified with a Lorentz-invariant coordinate zeta which measures the
separation of the constituents within a hadron at equal light-front time and
determines the off-shell dynamics of the bound state wavefunctions as a
function of the invariant mass of the constituents. The hadron eigenstates
generally have components with different orbital angular momentum; e.g., the
proton eigenstate in AdS/QCD with massless quarks has L=0 and L=1 light-front
Fock components with equal probability. Higher Fock states with extra
quark-anti quark pairs also arise. The soft-wall model also predicts the form
of the non-perturbative effective coupling and its beta-function. The AdS/QCD
model can be systematically improved by using its complete orthonormal
solutions to diagonalize the full QCD light-front Hamiltonian or by applying
the Lippmann-Schwinger method to systematically include QCD interaction terms.
Some novel features of QCD are discussed, including the consequences of
confinement for quark and gluon condensates. A method for computing the
hadronization of quark and gluon jets at the amplitude level is outlined.

could be avoidable by considering that the flavon is not the dominant component

relic density. This relates reheating temperature of the universe with seesaw
mass scale. If we assume this flavon is a particle decaying into positron (or

we find an interesting result that the allowed region is around O(10^12) GeV,

successful X-ray missions initiated by the Institute of Space and Astronautical
Science (ISAS). ASTRO-H will investigate the physics of the high-energy
universe by performing high-resolution, high-throughput spectroscopy with
moderate angular resolution. ASTRO-H covers very wide energy range from 0.3 keV
to 600 keV. ASTRO-H allows a combination of wide band X-ray spectroscopy (5-80
keV) provided by multilayer coating, focusing hard X-ray mirrors and hard X-ray
imaging detectors, and high energy-resolution soft X-ray spectroscopy (0.3-12
keV) provided by thin-foil X-ray optics and a micro-calorimeter array. The
mission will also carry an X-ray CCD camera as a focal plane detector for a
soft X-ray telescope (0.4-12 keV) and a non-focusing soft gamma-ray detector
(40-600 keV) . The micro-calorimeter system is developed by an international
collaboration led by ISAS/JAXA and NASA. The simultaneous broad bandpass,
coupled with high spectral resolution of Delta E ~7 eV provided by the
micro-calorimeter will enable a wide variety of important science themes to be
pursued.
