random graphs, i.e. how this heterogeneity affects the cooperative behavior of
model systems. It is not intended as a review on it, rather it is showed how
this question emerges naturally and can give useful insights to specific
instances. The first chapter is about the statistical mechanics of congestion
in queuing networks. The second is devoted to the study of the glassy dynamics
of facilitated spin models on disordered structures. In the third chapter, the
presence of inverse phase transitions in tri-critical spin systems on
heterogeneous random graphs is pointed out. Finally, the last chapter is on the
role of volatility in the evolution of social networks. In the conclusions, a
general insight about the interplay between structure and dynamics on
heterogeneous random graphs is given. It is based on the different scaling of
the transition point with the moments of the degree distribution for continuous
and discontinuous transitions, respectively.

study the Brownian motion of a ""quark"" represented by a string stretching from
the boundary to the horizon of an AdS_3-Vaidya spacetime. Surprisingly, we find
that the two-point function also thermalizes instantly. Since Brownian motion
is a 1/N effect, our result shows that, at least in certain cases, the rapid
thermalization property of holographic plasmas persists beyond leading order in
1/N.

gravity constructed from the Plebanski-Holst action. The reason for there being
several models currently under consideration is that no consensus has been
reached for how to implement the simplicity constraints. Indeed, none of these
models strictly follows from the original path integral with commuting B
fields, rather, by some non standard manipulations one always ends up with non
commuting B fields and the simplicity constraints become in fact anomalous
which is the source for there being several inequivalent strategies to
circumvent the associated problems. In this article, we construct a new
Euclidian Spin Foam Model which is constructed by standard methods from the
Plebanski-Holst path integral with commuting B fields discretised on a 4D
simplicial complex. The resulting model differs from the current ones in
several aspects, one of them being that the closure constraint needs special
care. Only when dropping the closure constraint by hand and only in the large
spin limit can the vertex amplitudes of this model be related to those of the
FK Model but even then the face and edge amplitude differ. Curiously, an ad hoc
non-commutative deformation of the $B^{IJ}$ variables leads from our new model
to the Barrett-Crane Model in the case of Barbero-Immirzi parameter goes to
infinity.

junctions (JJs) from interlayer migration of impurities, improve JJ critical
current (Ic) targeting and reproducibility, eliminate aging, and eliminate
pattern-dependent effects in Ic and tunneling characteristics of Nb/Al/AlOx/Nb
junctions in integrated circuits. The latter effects were recently found in
Nb-based JJs integrated into multilayered digital circuits. E.g., it was found
that Josephson critical current density (Jc) may depend on the JJ's
environment, on the type and size of metal layers making contact to niobium
base (BE) and counter electrodes (CE) of the junction, and also change with
time. Such Jc variations within a circuit reduce circuit performance and yield,
and restrict integration scale. This variability of JJs is explained as caused
by hydrogen contamination of Nb layers during wafer processing, which changes
the height and structural properties of AlOx tunnel barrier. Redistribution of
hydrogen impurities between JJ electrodes and other circuit layers by diffusion
along Nb wires and through contacts between layers causes long-term drift of
Jc. At least two DSLs are required to completely protect JJs from impurity
diffusion effects - right below the junction BE and right above the junction
CE. The simplest and the most technologically convenient DSLs we have found are
thin (from 3 nm to 10 nm) layers of Al. They were deposited in-situ under the
BE layer, thus forming an Al/Nb/Al/AlOx/Nb penta-layer, and under the first
wiring layer to junctions' CE, thus forming an Al/Nb wiring bi-layer. A
significant improvement of Jc uniformity on 150-mm wafer has also been obtained
along with large improvements in Jc targeting and run-to-run reproducibility.

method for the analysis of dynamical systems. In this approach one describes
the evolution of a dynamical system in geometric terms, by considering it as a
geodesic in a Finsler space. By associating a non-linear connection and a
Berwald type connection to the dynamical system, five geometrical invariants
are obtained, with the second invariant giving the Jacobi stability of the
system. The Jacobi (in)stability is a natural generalization of the
(in)stability of the geodesic flow on a differentiable manifold endowed with a
metric (Riemannian or Finslerian) to the non-metric setting. In the present
paper we review the basic mathematical formalism of the KCC theory, and present
some specific applications of this method in general relativity, cosmology and
astrophysics. In particular we investigate the Jacobi stability of the general
relativistic static fluid sphere with a linear barotropic equation of state, of
the vacuum in the brane world models, of a dynamical dark energy model, and of
the Lane-Emden equation, respectively. It is shown that the Jacobi stability
analysis offers a powerful and simple method for constraining the physical
properties of different systems, described by second order differential
equations.

behavior, including when large non-spherical deformations are involved, have
since been developed and have been shown to be accurate. The situation is
however different and common knowledge less advanced when the compressibility
of the medium surrounding the bubble is provided mainly by the presence of a
bubbly mixture. In one of the present works being carried out at DYNAFLOW,
INC., the dynamics of a primary relatively large bubble in a water mixture
including very fine bubbles is being investigated experimentally and the
results are being provided to several parallel on-going analytical and
numerical approaches. The main/primary bubble is produced by an underwater
spark discharge from two concentric electrodes placed in the bubbly medium,
which is generated using electrolysis. A grid of thin perpendicular wires is
used to generate bubble distributions of varying intensities. The size of the
main bubble is controlled by the discharge voltage, the capacitors size, and
the pressure imposed in the container. The size and concentration of the fine
bubbles can be controlled by the electrolysis voltage, the length, diameter,
and type of the wires, and also by the pressure imposed in the container. This
enables parametric study of the factors controlling the dynamics of the primary
bubble and development of relationships between the bubble characteristic
quantities such as maximum bubble radius and bubble period and the
characteristics of the surrounding two-phase medium: micro bubble sizes and
void fraction.

the well-known prisoner's dilemma, in which players choose between two pure
strategies: cooperation and defection. Increasingly, however, cooperation is
being studied in continuous games that feature a continuum of strategies
determining the level of cooperative investment. For the continuous snowdrift
game, it has been shown that a gradually evolving monomorphic population may
undergo evolutionary branching, resulting in the emergence of a defector
strategy that coexists with a cooperator strategy. This phenomenon has been
dubbed the 'tragedy of the commune'. Here we study the effects of fluctuating
group size on the tragedy of the commune and derive analytical conditions for
evolutionary branching. Our results show that the effects of fluctuating group
size on evolutionary dynamics critically depend on the structure of payoff
functions. For games with additively separable benefits and costs, fluctuations
in group size make evolutionary branching less likely, and sufficiently large
fluctuations in group size can always turn an evolutionary branching point into
a locally evolutionarily stable strategy. For games with multiplicatively
separable benefits and costs, fluctuations in group size can either prevent or
induce the tragedy of the commune. For games with general interactions between
benefits and costs, we derive a general classification scheme based on second
derivatives of the payoff function, to elucidate when fluctuations in group
size help or hinder cooperation.

This is because the 60 micron LF can not be fitted by a Schechter function with
a sharp exponential cutoff. We then seek the parameters in the CLFs that best
fit the LF and power spectrum. We find that the predicted galaxy bias as a
function of L60 from the best-fit model agrees well with the clustering
measurements. At the faint end of the LF where quiescent star-forming galaxies
dominate, most IRAS galaxies are central galaxies in halos of M >~ 10^{10}
h^{-1} M_sun but a non-negligible fraction are satellites typically hosted in
more massive halos. The majority of IRAS galaxies with L60 >~ 10^{10} h^{-2}
L_sun are M82 type starbursts which are central galaxies hosted in halos of M
>~ 10^{12.5} h^{-1} M_sun. In comparison, optical galaxies generally reside in
much more massive halos. The rate of change in L60 (an indicator of recent star
formation) as a function of halo mass at M >~ 10^{12.5} h^{-1} M_sun is much
larger that d L_optical / dM or d L_NIR / dM indicating the existence of
physical mechanisms which are very efficient in converting cold gas into stars,
possibly dynamical effects arising from interactions or mergers. We further
calculate the space density of major mergers for halos massive enough to host
ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) using the mean merger rate derived
from the Millennium simulations. Compared to the space density of local ULIRGs,
it implies that either the majority of major mergers at z~0 do not lead to
ULIRGs or the ULIRG phase is relatively short.

to the CCFs between the RASS Broad-line AGNs with SDSS Luminous Red Galaxies
(LRGs) in the redshift range 0.16<z<0.36 that was calculated in paper I. In our
HOD modeling approach, we use the known HOD of LRGs and constrain the HOD of
the AGNs by a model fit to the CCF. For the first time, we are able to go
beyond quoting merely a `typical' AGN host halo mass, M_h, and model the full
distribution function of AGN host dark matter halos. In addition, we are able
to determine the large-scale bias and the mean M_h more accurately. We explore
the behavior of three simple HOD models. Our first model (Model A) is a
truncated power-law HOD model in which all AGNs are satellites. With this
model, we find an upper limit to the slope (\alpha) of the AGN HOD that is far
below unity. The other two models have a central component, which has a step
function form, where the HOD is constant above a minimum mass, without (Model
B) or with (Model C) an upper mass cutoff, in addition to the truncated
power-law satellite component, similar to the HOD that is found for galaxies.
In these two models we find the upper limits of \alpha < 0.95 and \alpha < 0.84
for Model B and C respectively. Our analysis suggests that the satellite AGN
occupation increases slower than, or may even decrease with, M_h, in contrast
to the satellite's HODs of luminosity-threshold samples of galaxies, which, in
contrast, grow approximately as \propto M_h^\alpha with \alpha\approx 1. These
results are consistent with observations that the AGN fraction in groups and
clusters decreases with richness.

of some non-inflaton particles during inflation, for example via parametric
resonance or a phase transition. Such models have attracted interest recently
for a variety of reasons, including the possibility of slowing the motion of
the inflaton on a steep potential. In this review we show that interactions
between the produced particles and the inflaton condensate can lead to a
qualitatively new mechanism for generating cosmological fluctuations from
inflation. We illustrate this effect using a simple prototype model g^2
(\phi-\phi_0)^2\chi^2 for the interaction between the inflaton, \phi, and
iso-inflaton, \chi. Such interactions are quite natural in a variety of
inflation models from supersymmetry and string theory. Using both lattice field
theory simulations and analytical calculations, we study the quantum production
of \chi particles and their subsequent rescatterings off the condensate
\phi(t), which generates bremsstrahlung radiation of light inflaton
fluctuations \delta\phi. This mechanism leads to observable features in the
primordial power spectrum. We derive observational constraints on such features
and discuss their implications for popular models of inflation, including
brane/axion monodromy. Inflationary particle production also leads to a very
novel kind of nongaussian signature which may be observable in future missions.
We argue that this mechanism provides a simple and well-motivated option to
generate large nongaussianity, without fine-tuning the inflationary trajectory
or appealing to re-summation of an infinite series of high dimension operators.

enhanced Sp(2k) gauge symmetry for k small instantons, besides the allowed
SO(32) gauge symmetry. An interesting question now is to ask what happens when
we take the large k limit. In this paper we argue that in some special cases,
where Gauss' law allows the large k limit, the dynamics of the large k small
instantons can be captured by a dual gravitational description. For the cases
that we elaborate in this paper, the gravity duals are non-Kahler manifolds
although in general they could be non-geometric. These small instantons are
heterotic five-branes and the duality allows us to study the strongly coupled
field theories on these five-branes. We review and elaborate on some of the
recent observations pointing towards this duality, and argue that in certain
cases the gauge/gravity duality may be understood as small instanton
transitions under which the instantons smoothen out and consequently lose the
Sp(2k) gauge symmetry. This may explain how branes disappear on the dual side
and are replaced by fluxes. We analyse the torsion classes before and after the
transitions, and discuss briefly how the ADHM sigma model and related vector
bundles could be studied for these scenarios.

generalizing the notion of a trapped surface to quantum situations. Like
Penrose's original singularity theorem, it implies that spacetime is null
geodesically incomplete inside black holes, and to the past of spatially

the generalized second law requires that there only be a finite amount of

also rules out traversable wormholes, negative masses, and other forms of

become independent of the mother universe, or to restart inflation. Since the

argued that the results may hold in full quantum gravity. An introductory
section describes the second law and its time-reverse, in ordinary and

events are represented by elements of a causal set---a locally finite,
partially ordered set in which the partial order represents the causal
relationships between events. The work presented here describes a model for
matter on a causal set, specifically a theory of quantum scalar fields on a
causal set spacetime background.
  The work starts with a discrete path integral model for particles on a causal
set. Here quantum mechanical amplitudes are assigned to trajectories within the
causal set. By summing these over all trajectories between two spacetime events
we obtain a causal set particle propagator. With a suitable choice of
amplitudes this is shown to agree (in an appropriate sense) with the retarded
propagator for the Klein-Gordon equation in Minkowski spacetime.
  This causal set propagator is then used to define a causal set analogue of
the Pauli-Jordan function that appears in continuum quantum field theories. A
quantum scalar field is then modelled by an algebra of operators which satisfy
three simple conditions (including a bosonic commutation rule). Defining
time-ordering through a linear extension of the causal set these field
operators are used to define a causal set Feynman propagator. Evidence is
presented which shows agreement (in a suitable sense) between the causal set
Feynman propagator and the continuum Feynman propagator for the Klein-Gordon
equation in Minkowski spacetime. The Feynman propagator is obtained using the
eigendecomposition of the Pauli-Jordan function, a method which can also be
applied in continuum-based theories.
  The free field theory is extended to include interacting scalar fields. This
leads to a suggestion for a non-perturbative S-matrix on a causal set. Models
for continuum-based phenomenology and spin-half particles on a causal set are
also presented.

theory. We achieve this through a double- trace deformation of toroidally
compactified Yang-Mills theory on R2 \times S1_L \times S1_{\beta}. At large N,
fixed-L, and arbitrary {\beta}, the thermodynamics of the deformed theory is
equivalent to that of ordinary Yang-Mills theory at leading order in the large
N expansion. At fixed-N, small L and a range of {\beta}, the deformed theory
maps to a two-dimensional theory with electric and magnetic (order and
disorder) perturbations, analogs of which appear in planar spin-systems and
statistical physics. We show that in this regime the deconfinement transition
is driven by the competition between electric and magnetic perturbations in
this two-dimensional theory. This appears to support the scenario proposed by
Liao and Shuryak regarding the magnetic component of the quark-gluon plasma at

redshift interval. Galaxy distributions with the same two-point correlation
functions do not necessarily have the same companion count distributions. We
use this statistic to examine the environments of galaxies in the Sloan Digital

for the spatial distributions of galaxies, based on N-body simulations, and
data from SDSS DR4 to study the utility of the counts-in-cylinders statistic.
There is a very large scatter between the number of companions a galaxy has and
the mass of its parent dark matter halo and the halo occupation, limiting the
utility of this statistic for certain kinds of environmental studies. We also
show that prevalent, empirical models of galaxy clustering that match observed
two- and three-point clustering statistics well fail to reproduce some aspects
of the observed distribution of counts-in-cylinders on 1, 3 and 6-Mpc/h scales.

extensively analyzed the unquantized linear vector channel using graphical

proposed. In addition, we study the impact of finite receiver resolution in

Efforts to describe SN 2006gy have pushed the boundaries of current supernova

considers the supernova explosion of a massive star followed days later by the

tetragonal/orthorhombic, cubic/tetragonal, cubic/trigonal and
cubic/orthorhombic unit-cell distortions, with respectively, $N_{OP} = 1, 2, 3
$ and 2; and $N_V = 2, 3, 4$ and 6. Five 2D transitions are also considered, as
simpler examples. Following Barsch and Krumhansl, we scale the free energy to
absorb most material-dependent elastic coefficients into an overall prefactor,
by scaling in an overall elastic energy density; a dimensionless temperature
variable; and the spontaneous-strain magnitude at transition $\lambda <<1$.
  To leading order in $\lambda$ the scaled Landau minima become
material-independent, in a kind of 'quasi-universality'. The scaled minima in
$N_{OP}$-dimensional order-parameter space, fall at the centre and at the $N_V$
corners, of a transition-specific polyhedron inscribed in a sphere, whose
radius is unity at transition. The `polyhedra' for the four 3D transitions are
respectively, a line, a triangle, a tetrahedron, and a hexagon. We minimize the
$n$ terms harmonic in the non-order-parameter strains, by substituting
solutions of the 'no dislocation' St Venant compatibility constraints, and
explicitly obtain powerlaw anisotropic, order-parameter interactions, for all
transitions. In a reduced discrete-variable description, the competing minima
of the Landau free energies induce unit-magnitude pseudospin vectors, with $N_V
+1$ values, pointing to the polyhedra corners and the (zero-value) center.

spin relaxation of electrons in these materials is controlled by electron-hole
scattering, with small corrections from electron-electron scattering and
virtually none from electron-impurity scattering. We derive simple expressions
(one-dimensional and two-dimensional integrals respectively) for the effective
electron-hole and electron-electron scattering rates which enter the spin

comparable to the scattering rates from impurities in the electron liquid - a
common model for n-type doped semiconductors. As the density of electron-hole
pairs decreases (within the degenerate regime), a strong enhancement of the
scattering rates and a corresponding slowing down of spin relaxation is
predicted due to exchange and correlation effects in the electron-hole liquid.
In the opposite limit of high density, the original D'yakonov-Perel' model
fails due to decreasing scattering rates and is eventually superseded by free
precession of individual quasiparticle spins.

leakage/heating scheme and over 100 presupernova models, we study the effects
of the choice of nuclear equation of state (EOS), zero-age main sequence (ZAMS)
mass and metallicity, rotation, and mass-loss prescription on BH formation. We
find that the outcome, for a given EOS, can be estimated, to first order, by a
single parameter, the compactness of the stellar core at bounce. By comparing
protoneutron star (PNS) structure at the onset of gravitational instability
with solutions of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkof equations, we find that thermal
pressure support in the outer PNS core is responsible for raising the maximum
PNS mass by up to 25% above the cold NS value. By artificially increasing
neutrino heating, we find the critical neutrino heating efficiency required for
exploding a given progenitor structure and connect these findings with ZAMS
conditions, establishing, albeit approximately, for the first time based on
actual collapse simulations, the mapping between ZAMS parameters and the
outcome of core collapse. We also study the effect of progenitor rotation and
find that the dimensionless spin of nascent BHs may be robustly limited below

instabilities.

terms of the two-dimensional frustrated Heisenberg $J_1$-$J_2$ model has been
actively discussed recently. However, recent neutron scattering data has shown
that the pnictides have a relatively large spin wave dispersion in the
direction perpendicular to the planes. This indicates that the third dimension
is very important. Motivated by this observation we study the $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_c$
model that is the three dimensional generalization of the $J_1$-$J_2$
Heisenberg model for $S = 1/2$ and S = 1. Using self-consistent spin wave
theory we present a detailed description of the staggered magnetization and
magnetic excitations in the collinear state. We find that the introduction of
the interlayer coupling $J_c$ suppresses the quantum fluctuations and
strengthens the long range ordering. In the $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_c$ model, we find
two qualitatively distinct scenarios for how the collinear phase becomes
unstable upon increasing $J_1$. Either the magnetization or one of the spin
wave velocities vanishes. For $S = 1/2$ renormalization due to quantum
fluctuations is significantly stronger than for S=1, in particular close to the
quantum phase transition. Our findings for the $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_c$ model are of
general theoretical interest, however, the results show that it is unlikely
that the model is relevant to undoped pnictides.

quantum (statistical) variables (X$^i$) and one {\it Euclidean time} variable

expressions of the free energy are shown to be the ordinary ones (such as N
harmonic oscillators) or their simple variation. When we take a {\it

in techniques envisioned to speed up VLSI design. To ensure correct printing of
the constantly shrinking transistors and simultaneously handle their
increasingly large number, ever more computationally intensive techniques are
needed. Therefore, efficient algorithms for the Haar and Fourier transforms are
vital. We derive the complexity of both algorithms and compare it to that of
discrete transforms traditionally used in VLSI. We find a significant reduction
in complexity when the number of vertices of the polygons is small, as is the
case in VLSI layouts. This analysis is completed by an implementation and a
benchmark of the continuous algorithms and their discrete counterpart. We show
that on tested VLSI layouts the pruned continuous Haar transform is 5 to 25

luminosity class V-III, wich exhibit Balmer emission lines and often a near
infrared excess originating in an equatorially concentrated circumstellar
envelope, both produced by sporadic mass ejection episodes. The causes of the
abnormal mass loss (the so-called Be phenomenon) are as yet unknown. For the
first time, we can now study in detail Be stars outside the Earth's atmosphere
with sufficient temporal resolution. We investigate the variability of the Be
Star CoRoT-ID 102761769 observed with the CoRoT satellite in the exoplanet
field during the initial run. One low-resolution spectrum of the star was
obtained with the INT telescope at the Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos.
A time series analysis was performed using both cleanest and singular spectrum
analysis algorithms to the CoRoT light curve. To identify the pulsation modes
of the observed frequencies, we computed a set of models representative of
CoRoT-ID 102761769 by varying its main physical parameters inside the
uncertainties discussed. We found two close frequencies related to the star.
They are 2.465 $\rm c\,d^{-1}$ (28.5 $\mathrm{\mu Hz}$) and 2.441 $\rm
c\,d^{-1}$ (28.2 $\mathrm{\mu Hz}$). The precision to which those frequencies
were found is 0.018 $\rm c\,d^{-1}$ (0.2 $\mathrm{\mu Hz}$). The projected
stellar rotation was estimated to be 120 $\rm km\,s^{-1}$ from the Fourier
transform of spectral lines. If CoRoT-ID 102761769 is a typical Galactic Be
star it rotates near the critical velocity. The critical rotation frequency of
a typical B5-6 star is about 3.5 $\rm c\,d^{-1}$(40.5 $\mathrm{\mu Hz}$), which
implies that the above frequencies are really caused by stellar pulsations
rather than star's rotation.

of more than one planet, and the multiple planet system with a large mass
planet has more chance of detailed follow-up observations, the multiple planet
system may be an efficient way to search for sub-Jovian planets. We compare the
magnification pattern of the triple lens system with that of a best-fitted
binary system composed of a star and a Jovian mass planet, and check the
probability in detecting the low-mass secondary planet whose signature will be
superposed on that of the primary Jovian mass planet. Detection probabilities
of the low-mass planet in the triple lens system are quite similar to the
probability in detecting such a low-mass planet in a binary system with a star
and only a low-mass planet, which shows that the signature of a low-mass planet
can be effectively detected even when it is concurrent with the signature of
the more massive planet, implying that the binary superposition approximation
works over a relatively broad range of planet mass ratio and separations, and
the inaccuracies thereof do not significantly affect the detection probability
of the lower mass secondary planet. Since the signature of the Jovian mass
planet will be larger and lasts longer, thereby warranting more intensive
follow-up observations, the actual detection rate of the low-mass planet in a
triple system with a Jovian mass can be significantly higher than that in a
binary system with a low-mass planet only. We conclude that it may be
worthwhile to develop an efficient algorithm to search for `super-Earth'
planets in the paradigm of the triple lens model for high-magnification
microlensing events.

achieved by choosing well-matched samples of the original treated and control

accretion provides valuable insights about the nature of the phase trajectories
corresponding to the transonic accretion in the steady state, without taking
recourse to the explicit numerical solution commonly performed in the
literature to study the multi-transonic black hole accretion disc and related
astrophysical phenomena. Investigation of the accretion flow around a non
rotating black hole under the influence of various pseudo-Schwarzschild
potentials and forming different geometric configurations of the flow structure
manifests that the general profile of the parameter space divisions describing
the multi-critical accretion is roughly equivalent for various flow geometries.
However, a mere variation of the polytropic index of the flow cannot map a
critical solution from one flow geometry to the another, since the numerical
domain of the parameter space responsible to produce multi-critical accretion
does not undergo a continuous transformation in multi-dimensional parameter
space. The stationary configuration used to demonstrate the aforementioned
findings is shown to be stable under linear perturbation for all kind of flow
geometries, black hole potentials, and the corresponding equations of state
used to obtain the critical transonic solutions. Finally, the structure of the
acoustic metric corresponding to the propagation of the linear perturbation
studied are discussed for various flow geometries used.

Our aim in this paper is to propose a definition for the mappings E_i and F_i

operators only when both halves are isomorphic, which, on the level of the
Grothendieck group, corresponds to working with paired simples as pairs, and
crossing over between the symmetric and alternating groups, in order to send
paired simples to paired simples.This is equivalent to working with the
irreducible supermodules, as in the work of Brundan and Kleshchev, though we
don't introduce the supermodule language into this paper. The main difference
between our approach and theirs is the crossovers, which occasionally force
extra halving of modules.The definition is based on the method of permutation m
odules from Kessar-Schaps. We apply it to short strings and show that, at least
on the individual strings, it is compatible with the form of the tilting

Methods. Radiative MHD simulations of magnetoconvection are used to produce
photospheric models. Our starting point is a non-magnetic model of solar
convection, where we introduce a uniform magnetic field and follow the
evolution of the field in the simulated photosphere. We find two different
types of photospheric vortices, and provide a link between the vorticity
generation and the presence of the intergranular magnetic field. A detailed
analysis of the vorticity equation, combined with the G-band radiative
diagnostics, allows us to identify the sources and observational signatures of
photospheric vorticity in the simulated photosphere. Results. Two different
types of photospheric vorticity, magnetic and non-magnetic, are generated in
the domain. Nonmagnetic vortices are generated by the baroclinic motions of the
plasma in the photosphere, while magnetic vortices are produced by the magnetic
tension in the intergranular magnetic flux concentrations. The two types of
vortices have different shapes. We find that the vorticity is generated more
efficiently in the magnetised model. Simulated G-band images show a direct
connection between magnetic vortices and rotary motions of photospheric bright
points, and suggest that there may be a connection between the magnetic bright
point rotation and small-scale swirl motions observed higher in the atmosphere.

fascinated researchers and found numerous applications in areas such as
economics, insurance, reliability, and, more generally, decision making under
uncertainly. Gruss-type bounds for covariances have been established mainly
under most general dependence structures, meaning no restrictions on the
dependence structure between the two underlying random variables. Recent work
in the area has revealed a potential for improving Gruss-type bounds, including
the original Gruss's bound, assuming dependence structures such as quadrant
dependence (QD). In this paper we demonstrate that the relatively little
explored notion of `quadrant dependence in expectation' (QDE) is ideally suited
in the context of bounding covariances, especially those that appear in the
aforementioned areas of application. We explore this research avenue in detail,
establish general Gruss-type bounds, and illustrate them with newly constructed
examples of bivariate distributions, which are not QD but, nevertheless, are
QDE. The examples rely on specially devised copulas. We supplement the examples
with results concerning general copulas and their convex combinations. In the

Oph, V4745 Sgr, V5113 Sgr, V458 Vul, and V378 Ser, based on the low-resolution
spectra obtained at the Fujii-Bisei Observatory and the Bisei Astronomical
Observatory, Japan. In the light curves, these 6 novae show several
rebrightenings during the early phase lasting ~10 days after the first maximum
in fast novae, and ~100 days in slow novae. The early spectra of all of these
novae had emission lines with a P-Cygni profile at the maximum brightness. The
absorption component of the P-Cygni profiles then disappeared after the
maximum, and reappeared when the novae brightened to the next maximum. We
suggest that the re-appearance of the absorption component at the rebrightening
is attributable to re-expansion of the photosphere after it once shifts
sufficiently inside. From the light curves, we found that the time intervals of
the rebrightenings of these 6 novae show a similar systematic trend, which is
applicable to all types of novae: fast and slow, and Fe II type and hybrid
type. Moreover, we note the difference between the spectra at the
rebrightenings during the early phase and at the rebrightening in V2362 Cyg,
and at the oscillation during the transition phase in V1494 Aql, which means
difference of the physical mechanism of the rebrightening during the early
phase and the later oscillations.

general stellar spectral reference in the mid-infrared. It includes stars from
all luminosity classes, as well as Wolf-Rayet (WR) objects. Furthermore, it
includes some objects of intrinsic interest, like blue stragglers and certain
pulsating variables. All the spectra have been uniformly reduced, and all are
available online. For dwarfs and giants, the spectra of early-type objects are
relatively featureless, dominated by Hydrogen lines around A spectral types.
Besides these, the most noticeable photospheric features correspond to water
vapor and silicon monoxide in late-type objects and methane and ammonia
features at the latest spectral types. Most supergiant spectra in the Atlas
present evidence of circumstellar gas. The sample includes five M supergiant
spectra, which show strong dust excesses and in some cases PAH features.
Sequences of WR stars present the well-known pattern of lines of HeI and HeII,
as well as forbidden lines of ionized metals. The characteristic flat-top shape
of the [Ne III] line is evident even at these low spectral resolutions. Several
Luminous Blue Variables and other transition stars are present in the Atlas and
show very diverse spectra, dominated by circumstellar gas and dust features. We
show that the [8]-[24] Spitzer colors (IRAC and MIPS) are poor predictors of

coupling strengths with two electrodes are interchanged, which can be observed
experimentally just by reversing the bias-voltages. Moreover, we find that the
effect of finite $U$ on shot noise depends on the internal level structure of
the SMM and the coupling asymmetry of the SMM with two electrodes as well. When
the coupling of the SMM with the incident-electrode is stronger than that with
the outgoing-electrode, the super-Poissonian shot noise in the sequential
tunneling regime appears under relatively small gate-voltage and relatively
large finite $U$, and dose not for $U\rightarrow \infty $; while it occurs at
relatively large gate-voltage for the opposite coupling case. The formation
mechanism of super-Poissonian shot noise can be qualitatively attributed to the
competition between fast and slow transport channels.

congestion control protocol for data exchange. The protocol design starts from
the assumption that network bottlenecks are at the access of the network, and
that thus user traffic competes creating self-inducing congestion. To relieve
from this phenomenon, LEDBAT is designed to quickly infer that self-induced
congestion is approaching (by detecting relative changes of the one-way delay
in the transmission path), and to react by reducing the sending rate prior that
congestion occurs. Prior work has however shown LEDBAT to be affected by a
latecomer advantage, where newly arriving connections can starve already
existing flows. In this work, we propose modifications to the congestion window
update mechanism of the LEDBAT protocol that aim at solving this issue,
guaranteeing thus intra-protocol fairness and efficiency. Closed-form
expressions for the stationary throughput and queue occupancy are provided via
a fluid model, whose accuracy is confirmed by means of ns2 packet level
simulations. Our results show that the proposed change can effective solve the

string fields"" (PSF's). In an introduction we present the necessary definitions
and derive propagators and currents of these PDF's on flat space. Their
off-shell cubic interaction can be derived after all off-shell cubic
interactions of triplets of higher spin fields have become known [2],[3]. Then
we discuss four-point functions of any quartet of PSF's. In subsequent sections
we exploit the fact that higher spin field theories in $AdS_{d+1}$ are
determined by AdS/CFT correspondence from universality classes of critical
systems in $d$ dimensional flat spaces. The O(N) invariant sectors of the O(N)
vector models for $1\leq N \leq \infty$ play for us the role of ""standard
models"", for varying $N$, they contain e.g. the Ising model for N=1 and the
spherical model for $N=\infty$. A formula for the masses squared that break
gauge symmetry for these O(N) classes is presented for d = 3. For the PSF on
$AdS$ space it is shown that it can be derived by lifting the PSF on flat space
by a simple kernel which contains the sum over all spins. Finally we use an
algorithm to derive all symmetric tensor higher spin fields. They arise from
monomials of scalar fields by derivation and selection of conformal
(quasiprimary) fields. Typically one monomial produces a multiplet of spin $s$
conformal higher spin fields for all $s \geq 4$, they are distinguished by
their anomalous dimensions (in $CFT_3$) or by their mass (in $AdS_4$). We sum
over these multiplets and the spins to obtain ""string type fields"", one for
each such monomial.

explicit chiral symmetry breaking by the lattice regularisation of the Dirac

almost all observables if the residual mass of the Dirac operator is much
smaller than the quark mass. However, maintaining a small residual mass becomes
increasingly expensive as the quark mass decreases towards the physical value
and the continuum limit is approached. We investigate the feasibility of using
a new approximately chiral Dirac operator with a small residual mass as an
alternative to overlap and domain wall fermions for lattice simulations. Our
Dirac operator is constructed from a Zolotarev rational approximation for the
matrix sign function that is optimal for bulk modes of the Hermitian kernel
Dirac operator but not for the low-lying parts of its spectrum. We test our
operator on various 32^3\times64 lattices, comparing the residual mass and the
performance of the Hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm at a similar lattice spacing
and pion mass with a hyperbolic tangent operator as used by domain wall
fermions. We find that our approximations have a significantly smaller residual
mass than domain wall fermions at a similar computational cost, and still admit
topological charge change.

low temperatures data show excitations over an energy gap (2DS/kBTc \approx
2.1) much smaller than the BCS value. The overall temperature dependence of the
electronic specific heat Ce can be explained either by the existence of a
strongly anisotropic single-energy gap or within a two-gap scenario with the
large gap about twice bigger than the small one. The field dependence of the
Sommerfeld coefficient shows a strong curvature for both principal-field

system revolves in an eccentric orbit with a periodicity of 140.7 days. The
secondary has a similar temperature but is less evolved and fainter than the
primary. It is also rotating more rapidly. Since the composite spectra are
heavily blended, the direct extraction of radial velocities over the orbit of
component B was hitherto unsuccessful. Using high-resolution spectroscopic data
recently obtained with the Elodie (OHP, France) and Hermes (ORM, La Palma,
Spain) spectrographs, and applying a spectra disentangling algorithm to three
independent data sets including spectra from the Oak Ridge Observatory (USA),
we derived an improved spectroscopic orbit and refined the solution by
performing a combined astrometric-spectroscopic analysis based on the new
spectroscopy and the long-baseline data from the Mark III optical
interferometer. As a result, the velocity amplitude of the fainter component is
obtained in a direct and objective way. Major progress based on this new
determination includes an improved computation of the orbital parallax. Our
mass ratio is in good agreement with the older estimates of Peterson et al.
(1991, 1993), but the mass of the primary is 15-25% higher than the more recent
estimates by Torres et al. (1997) and Armstrong et al. (2006). Due to the

these new determinations imply stricter constraints for the age and the
metallicity of the Hyades cluster. The location of component B can be explained

projections restricted to a compact set \Omega \subset \R^{2}, the problem
dates back to a 1954 paper by Marstrand: he proved that for almost every
\lambda there exist positively many $t \in \R$ such that \dim
\pi_{\lambda}^{-1}{t} = \dim \Omega - 1. For generalized projections, the same
result was obtained 50 years later by J\""arvenp\""a\""a, J\""arvenp\""a\""a and
Niemel\""a. In this paper, we improve the previously existing estimates by
replacing the phrase 'almost all \lambda' with a sharp bound for the dimension
of the exceptional parameters.

annihilation or decay), but due to an instrumental problem. In the present
paper, however, we focus our interest rather conservatively upon the internal
relation between these three components, using {\it common} galactic

a mean and a turbulent component). It constitutes a frothy medium that is
mostly out of equilibrium and is ram pressure dominated on most of the
temperature ranges, except for T< 200 K and T> 1E6 K, where magnetic and
thermal pressures dominate, respectively. Such lack of equilibrium is also
imposed by the feedback of the radiative processes into the ISM flow. Many
models of the ISM or isolated phenomena, such as bubbles, superbubbles, clouds
evolution, etc., take for granted that the flow is in the so-called collisional
ionization equilibrium (CIE). However, recombination time scales of most of the
ions below 1E6 K are longer than the cooling time scale. This implies that the
recombination lags behind and the plasma is overionized while it cools. As a
consequence cooling deviates from CIE. This has severe implications on the
evolution of the ISM flow and its ionization structure. Here, besides reviewing
several models of the ISM, including bubbles and superbubbles, the validity of
the CIE approximation is discussed, and a presentation of recent developments
in modeling the ISM by taking into account the time-dependent ionization
structure of the flow in a full-blown numerical 3D high resolution simulation

coupling two hyperfine ground state levels using a pair of far-detuned Raman
laser beams. Resonant light for Doppler cooling and detection is derived from
the same laser source by means of an electro-optic modulator, generating a
sideband which is resonant with the atomic transition. We demonstrate
ground-state cooling of one of the vibrational modes of the ion in the trap

discussed by observing the temporal evolution of Raman-stimulated sideband
transitions. The setup is a major simplification over existing state-of-the-art
systems, typically involving up to three separate laser sources.

difficult problem due to the different modeling abstractions used for control
components and for software components. A recent trend to address this
difficulty is to reduce the need for verification by adopting correct-by-design
methodologies. According to the correct-by-design paradigm, one seeks to
automatically synthesize a controller that can be refined into code and that
enforces temporal specifications on the cyber-physical system. In this paper we
consider an instance of this problem where the specifications are given by a
fragment of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) and the physical environment is
described by a smooth differential equation. The contribution of this paper is
to show that synthesis for cyber-physical systems is viable by considering a
fragment of LTL that is expressive enough to describe interesting properties
but simple enough to avoid Safra's construction. We report on two examples
illustrating a preliminary implementation of these techniques on the tool
PESSOALTL.

calibration for semi-empirical correction of ab initio harmonic properties

is devoted to the evaluation of scaling factor uncertainty, and to its effect
on the accuracy of scaled properties. We argue that in most cases of interest
the standard calibration model is not statistically valid, in the sense that it
is not able to fit experimental calibration data within their uncertainty

is used to evaluate a possible `spurious' contribution to the recently measured
nonlinear susceptibility of an archetypical glassforming liquid (Glycerol).
Those measurements have been shown to give a direct evaluation of the number of

the relaxation frequency of the liquid. In the high frequency range, when
f/f_{\alpha} >= 1, we find that the heating contribution is damped because the
dipoles cannot follow instantaneously the temperature modulation due to the
heating phenomenon. An estimate of the magnitude of this damping is given.

Physics beyond the Standard Model can modify the relations between electroweak

in terms of effective, so-called oblique parameters. A global fit of the
electroweak SM, as performed with the Gfitter package, allows the determination
of the oblique parameters and to probe physics models and to set constraints on

Through the formalism of oblique parameters we obtain constraints on BSM models

$E_7(a_i)$ and $E_7$; resp. $D_n(a_i)$ and $D_n$), the linkage system has,
respectively, 2, 1, 1 components, each of which contains, respectively, 27, 56,
$2n$ elements. Numbers 27, 56 and $2n$ are well-known dimensions of the
smallest fundamental representations of semisimple Lie algebras, respectively,
for $E_6$, $E_7$ and $D_n$. The 8-cell ""spindle-like"" linkage subsystems called
loctets play the essential role in describing the linkage systems. It turns
that weight systems also can be described by means of loctets.

accounted for by particles which were in thermal equilibrium and decoupled
before the big bang nucleosynthesis. Broadly speaking, there are two
possibilities: 1) there are about 10 particles which have very weak couplings
to the standard model particles and decoupled much before the QCD phase
transition; 2) there is one or a few light particles with a reasonably strong
coupling to the plasma and it decouples after the QCD phase transition.

candidate, which evades astrophysical constraints. Interestingly, such a

absorbed power-law with indication for a soft excess. Depending on the
modelling of the soft X-ray spectrum, the photon index ranges between 0.53 and
0.66. We identify the optical counterpart as a B = 14.9mag star which was
monitored during the MACHO and OGLE-III projects. The optical light curves show
regular outbursts by ~0.5 mag in B and R and up to 0.9 mag in I which repeat
with a time scale of about 1000 days. The OGLE-III optical colours of the star
are consistent with an early B spectral type. An optical spectrum obtained at

2009 shows H_alpha emission with an equivalent width of 3.5 +/- 0.6 A. The

the Planck spectrum is continuous, while the stationary modes of radiation in a

process of surface accommodation. The experimentally observed non-integer

study the population of X-ray sources in this neighbouring galaxy. During one
of the observations, the symbiotic binary SMC3 was found at its highest X-ray
luminosity observed until now. In SMC3 wind accretion from a giant donor star
onto a white dwarf is believed to cause steady hydrogen burning on the white
dwarf surface, making such systems candidates for supernova type Ia
progenitors. It was suggested that the X-ray source is eclipsed every ~4.5
years by the companion star and its stellar wind to explain the large X-ray
variability seen in ROSAT data. We use the available X-ray data to test this
scenario. We present the ~20 year X-ray light curve of SMC3 and study the
spectral evolution as seen with XMM-Newton/EPIC-pn to investigate possible
scenarios which can reproduce the high X-ray variability. We did not find
significant variations in the photo-electric absorption, as it would be
expected during eclipse ingress and egress. Instead, the X-ray spectra from
different intensity levels, when modelled by black-body emission, can be better
explained by variations either in normalisation (by a factor of ~50) or in
temperature (kT between 24 eV and 34 eV). The light curve shows maxima and
minima with slow transitions between them. To explain the gradual variations in
the X-ray light curve and to avoid changes in absorption by neutral gas, a
predominant part of the stellar wind must be ionised by the X-ray source.
Compton scattering with variable electron column density (of the order of 5 x
10^24 cm^-2) along the line of sight could then be responsible for the
intensity changes. The X-ray variability of SMC3 could also be caused by
temperature changes in the hydrogen burning envelope of the white dwarf, an
effect which could even dominate if the stellar wind density is not
sufficiently high.

the H$\beta$ broad emission line (BEL) gas is arranged in a predominantly
planar orientation, and this result may well also apply to radio-quiet quasars.
This would imply that the observed full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the
H$\beta$ BELs is dependent on the orientation of the line of sight to the gas.
If this view is correct then we propose that the FWHM can be used as a
surrogate, in large samples, to determine the line of sight to the H$\beta$
BELs in broad absorption line quasars (BALQSOs).... It is determined that there
is a statistically significant excess of narrow line profiles in the SDSS DR7
archival spectra of low ionization broad absorption line quasars (LoBALQSOs),
indicating that BAL gas flowing close to the equatorial plane does not commonly
occur in these sources. We also find that the data is not well represented by
random lines of sight to the BAL gas. Our best fit indicates two classes of
LoBALQSOs, the majority ($\approx 2/3$) are polar outflows, that are
responsible for the enhanced frequency of narrow line profiles, and the
remainder are equatorial outflows. We further motivated the line of sight
explanation of the narrow line excess in LoBALQSOs by considering the notion
that the skewed distribution of line profiles is driven by an elevated
Eddington ratio in BALQSOs. We constructed a variety of control samples
comprised of nonLoBALQSOs matched to a de-reddened LoBALQSO sample in redshift,
luminosity, black hole mass and Eddington ratio. It is demonstrated that the
excess of narrow profiles persists within the LoBALQSO sample relative to each
of the control samples with no reduction of the statistical significance. Thus,
we eliminate the possibility that the excess narrow lines seen in the LoBALQSOs
arise from an enhanced Eddington ratio.

short-ranged, nonnegative pair potential with a single local minimum of height
$H$ at unit distance and vanishes cubically at a distance of $\rt$. We have
developed this potential to produce ground states with the symmetry of the
triangular lattice while favoring the presence of vacancies. After an
exhaustive search using various optimization and simulation methods, we believe
that we have determined the ground states for all pressures, densities, and $0

""quintic potential"" include high-density and low-density triangular lattices,
kagom\'{e} and honeycomb crystals, and stripes. We find that these ground
states are mechanically stable but are difficult to self-assemble in computer
simulations without defects. For specific areas above $3\rt/2$, these systems
have a ground-state phase diagram that corresponds to hard disks with radius
$\rt$. For the special case of H=0, a broad range of ground states is
available. Analysis of this case suggests that among many ground states, a
high-density triangular lattice, low-density triangular lattice, and striped
phases have the highest entropy for certain densities. The simplicity of this
potential makes it an attractive candidate for experimental realization with
application to the development of novel colloidal crystals or photonic
materials.

continuum towards the low energies ($E<3$ keV observer frame). This behaviour
is well reproduced both with an absorbed power-law model
($N_H\sim10^{20}$-$10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$ in the rest-frame of the sources) or a
broken power-law continuum model (with an energy break below 3 keV in the
observer-frame). No Compton reflection features, Fe $K\alpha$ line and hump at
high energies, have been detected, with the exception of the source IGR
J22517+2218 that shows the presence of a weak iron line. In this work we also
investigate a possible correlation between the absorption column density $N_H$

absorption at z$>$2 for a larger sample compared to previous results. The
