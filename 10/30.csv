the problem in the regime where diffusion theory (the Torrey equation is

the same regime using a slightly more general formulation using Redfield theory
formulated in terms of the auto-correlation function of the fluctuating field

Heisenberg model with a spatially staggered anisotropy on the square lattice as
suggested in \cite{Wenzel08}, we re-investigate the phase transition of this
model induced by dimerization using first principle Monte Carlo simulations. We
focus on studying the finite-size scaling of $\rho_{s1} L$ and $\rho_{s2} L$,
where $L$ stands for the spatial box size used in the simulations and
$\rho_{si}$ with $i \in \{1,2\}$ is the spin-stiffness in $i$-direction. From
our Monte Carlo data, we find that $\rho_{s2} L$ suffers a much less severe
correction compared to that of $\rho_{s1} L$. Therefore $\rho_{s2} L$ is a
better quantity than $\rho_{s1} L$ for finite-size scaling analysis concerning
the limitation of the availability of large volumes data in our study. Further,
motivated by the so-called cubical regime in magnon chiral perturbation theory,
we additionally perform a finite-size scaling analysis on our Monte Carlo data
with the assumption that the ratio of spatial winding numbers squared is fixed
through all simulations. As a result, the physical shape of the system remains
fixed in our calculations. The validity of this new idea is confirmed by
studying the phase transition driven by spatial anisotropy for the ladder
anisotropic Heisenberg model. With this new strategy, even from $\rho_{s1} L$
which receives the most serious correction among the observables considered in
this study, we arrive at a value for the critical exponent $\nu$ which is
consistent with the expected $O(3)$ value by using only up to $L = 64$ data
points.

general effective Lagrangian for pions and nucleons consistent with the chiral
symmetry of QCD. For energies below the pion-production threshold it is
possible to eliminate the pionic degrees of freedom and derive nuclear
potentials and nuclear current operators solely in terms of the nucleonic
degrees of freedom. This is very important because, despite a lot of experience
gained in the past, the consistency between two-nucleon forces, many-nucleon
forces and the corresponding current operators has not been achieved yet. In
this presentation we consider the recently derived long-range two-pion exchange
(TPE) contributions to the nuclear current operator which appear at next-to
leading order of the chiral expansion. These operators do not contain any free
parameters. We study their role in the deuteron photodisintegration reaction

states are calculated using five different chiral N2LO nucleon-nucleon (NN)
potentials which allows to estimate the theoretical uncertainty at a given

to the reference predictions based on the AV18 NN potential and the current

database (Suda et al. 2008, PASJ, 60, 1159).The analyses of carbon-enhanced
stars in our sample suggest that the nucleosynthesis in AGB stars can
contribute to the carbon enrichment in a different way depending on whether the
metallicity is above or below [Fe/H] ~ -2.5, which is consistent with the
current models of stellar evolution at low metallicity. We find the transition
of the initial mass function at [Fe/H] ~ -2 in the viewpoint of the
distribution of carbon abundance and the frequency of carbon-enhanced stars.
For observed EMP stars, we confirmed that some, not all, of observed stars
might have undergone at least two types of extra mixing to change their surface
abundances. One is to deplete the lithium abundance during the early phase of
red giant branch. Another is to decrease the C/N ratio by one order of
magnitude during the red giant branch phase. Observed small scatters of
abundances for alpha-elements and iron-group elements suggest that the chemical
enrichment of our Galaxy takes place in a well-mixed interstellar medium. We
find that the abundance trends of alpha-elements are highly correlated with
each other, while the abundances of iron-group elements are subject to
different slopes relative to the iron abundance. This implies that the
supernova yields of alpha-elements are almost independent of mass and
metallicity, while those of iron-group elements have a metallicity dependence
or mass dependence with the variable initial mass function.The occurrence of
the hot bottom burning in the mass range of 5 <~ M / Msun <~ 6 is consistent
with the initial mass function of the Galaxy peaked at ~ 10 - 12 Msun to be

emerging as a viable option for future wireless networks with extended
lifetime. Equally important to their counterpart in the design of energy
harvesting radios are the design principles that this new networking paradigm
calls for. In particular, unlike wireless networks considered up to date, the
energy replenishment process and the storage constraints of the rechargeable
batteries need to be taken into account in designing efficient transmission
strategies. In this work, we consider such transmission policies for
rechargeable nodes, and identify the optimum solution for two related problems.
Specifically, the transmission policy that maximizes the short term throughput,
i.e., the amount of data transmitted in a finite time horizon is found. In
addition, we show the relation of this optimization problem to another, namely,
the minimization of the transmission completion time for a given amount of
data, and solve that as well. The transmission policies are identified under
the constraints on energy causality, i.e., energy replenishment process, as
well as the energy storage, i.e., battery capacity. The power-rate relationship
for this problem is assumed to be an increasing concave function, as dictated
by information theory. For battery replenishment, a model with discrete packets
of energy arrivals is considered. We derive the necessary conditions that the
throughput-optimal allocation satisfies, and then provide the algorithm that
finds the optimal transmission policy with respect to the short-term throughput
and the minimum transmission completion time. Numerical results are presented
to confirm the analytical findings.

review resarch work that we have done toward the development of an ""Ising

four-dimensional (three in space and one in time) cellular automaton (CA) model
of cancer in which healthy cells transition between states (proliferative,
hypoxic, and necrotic) according to simple local rules and their present
states, which can viewed as a stripped-down Ising model of cancer. This model
is applied to model the growth of glioblastoma multiforme, the most malignant
of brain cancers. This is followed by a discussion of the extension of the
model to study the effect on the tumor dynamics and geometry of a mutated
subpopulation. A discussion of how tumor growth is affected by chemotherapeutic
treatment is then described. How angiogenesis as well as the heterogeneous and
confined environment in which a tumor grows is incorporated in the CA model is
discussed. The characterization of the level of organization of the invasive
network around a solid tumor using spanning trees is subsequently described.
Then, we describe open problems and future promising avenues for future
research, including the need to develop better molecular-based models that
incorporate the true heterogeneous environment over wide range of length and
time scales (via imaging data), cell motility, oncogenes, tumor suppressor
genes and cell-cell communication. The need to bring to bear the powerful
machinery of the theory of heterogeneous media to better understand the
behavior of cancer in its microenvironment is presented.

transmits and receives in a band that is orthogonal to the IC. The channel
associated with the relay is thus an out-of-band relay channel (OBRC). The
focus is on a symmetric channel model, in order to assess the fundamental
impact of the OBRC on the signal interaction of the IC, in the simplest
possible setting. First, the linear deterministic model is investigated and the
sum capacity of this channel is established for all possible channel
parameters. In particular, it is observed that the impact of OBRC, as its links
get stronger, is similar to that of output feedback for the IC. The insights
obtained from the deterministic model are then used to design achievable
schemes for the Gaussian model. The interference links are classified as
extremely strong, very strong, strong, moderate, weak, and very weak. For
strong and moderate interference, separate encoding is near optimal. For very
strong and extremely strong interference, the interference links provide side
information to the destinations, which can help the transmission through the
OBRC. For weak or very weak interference, an extension of the Han-Kobayashi
scheme for the IC is utilized, where the messages are split into common and
private. To achieve higher rates, it is beneficial to further split the common
message into two parts, and the OBRC plays an important role in decoding the
common message. It is shown that our strategy achieves the symmetric capacity
to within 1.14625 bits per channel use with duplexing factor 0.5, and 1.27125
bits per channel use for arbitrary duplexing factors, for all channel
parameters. An important observation from the constant gap result is that
strong interference can be beneficial with the presence of an OBR.

at low redshift z in different cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, have
been studied through a detailed follow-up backwards in time of their
constituent mass elements (sampled by particles) of different types. Then, the
configurations they depict at progressively higher zs have been analysed.
  The analyses show that these histories share common generic patterns,
irrespective of particular circumstances. In any case, the results we have
found are different depending on the particle type. The most outstanding
differences follow. We have found that by z ~ 3.5 - 6, mass elements identified
as stellar particles at z=0 exhibit a gaseous cosmic-web-like morphology with
scales of ~ 1 physical Mpc, where the densest mass elements have already turned
into stars by z ~ 6. These settings are in fact the densest pieces of the
cosmic web, where no hot particles show up, and dynamically organized as a
hierarchy of flow convergence regions, that is, attraction basins for mass
flows. On the other hand, mass elements identified at the diffuse hot coronae
surrounding massive galaxies at z = 0, do not display a clear web-like
morphology at any z. Diffuse gas is heated when flow convergence regions go
through contractive deformations, and most of it keeps hot and with low density
along the evolution.
  To shed light on the physical foundations of the behaviour our analyses show
up, as well as on their possible observational implications, these patterns
have been confronted with some generic properties of singular flows as
described by the adhesion model. We have found that these common patterns
simulations show can be interpreted as a consequence of flow properties, that,
moreover, could explain different generic observational results on massive
galaxies or their samples. We briefly discuss some of them.[Abridged]

defined by Barbasch and Vogan. According to predictions of Arthur (established
by Adams, Barbasch, and Vogan), this set is an overlapping union of Arthur
packets. Each packet gives rise to a canonical virtual representation whose
character is stable in the sense of Langlands and Shelstad. But these stable
characters seldom span the space of all stable characters of virtual special
unipotent representations. Under natural hypotheses, we give a canonical basis
of this latter space in terms of rational forms of special pieces of the
nilpotent cone of the Langlands dual Lie algebra. (This basis extends the
stable characters arising from set of Arthur packets.) Some consequences of our
results have nothing to do with real groups; for example, we are able to define
a partial section of the Springer-Steinberg map from the Weyl group to
nilpotent adjoint orbits.

can create a gap in the disk near the orbital radius. At late times, when the
binary inspiral timescale due to gravitational wave emission becomes shorter
than the viscous timescale in the disk, the binary decouples from the disk and
eventually merges. Prior to decoupling the balance between tidal and viscous
torques drives the disk to a quasistationary equilibrium state, perturbed
slightly by small amplitude, spiral density waves emanating from the edges of
the gap. We consider a black hole binary with a companion of smaller mass and
construct a simple Newtonian model for a geometrically thin, Keplerian disk in
the orbital plane of the binary. We solve the disk evolution equations in
steady state to determine the quasistationary, (orbit-averaged) surface density
profile prior to decoupling. We use our solution, which is analytic up to
simple quadratures, to compute the electromagnetic flux and approximate
radiation spectrum during this epoch. A single nondimensional parameter
Td/Tvis, equal to the ratio of the tidal to viscous torque at the orbital
radius, determines the disk structure, including the surface density profile,
the extent of the gap, the existence of an inner disk, and the accretion rate.
The solution reduces to the Shakura-Sunyaev profile for a stationary accretion
disk around a single black hole in the limit of small Td/Tvis. Our solution may
be useful for choosing physical parameters and setting up quasistationary disk
initial data for detailed numerical simulations that begin prior to decoupling

of a cluster of mass M at redshift z can falsify LCDM and quintessence given
cosmological parameter uncertainties and sample variance, as well as for the
expected number of such clusters in the light cone and the Eddington bias
factor that must be applied to observed masses. By our conservative confidence
criteria, which equivalently require masses 3 times larger than typically

known clusters falsify these models. Various systematic errors, including
uncertainties in the form of the mass function and differences between
supernova light curve fitters, typically shift the exclusion curves by less

wind. We examine, in detail, the topology of such magnetic configurations using
an analytical source surface model that allows for analysis of the field with
arbitrary resolution. Our analysis reveals three important new results: First,
a coronal hole boundary can join stably to the separatrix boundary of a
parasitic polarity region. Second, a single parasitic polarity region can
produce multiple null points in the corona and, more important, separator lines
connecting these points. It is known that such topologies are extremely
favorable for magnetic reconnection, because they allow this process to occur
over the entire length of the separators rather than being confined to a small
region around the nulls. Finally, the coronal holes are not connected by an
open-field corridor of finite width, but instead are linked by a singular line
that coincides with the separatrix footprint of the parasitic polarity. We
investigate how the topological features described above evolve in response to
the motion of the parasitic polarity region. The implications of our results
for the sources of the slow solar wind and for coronal and heliospheric

clouds cataloged at the tail of the Magellanic Stream to provide insight into
the origin and destruction mechanism of Complex C. Magellanic Stream and
Complex C clouds show similarities in their mass distributions (slope = -0.7
and -0.6, respectively) and have a common linewidth of 20 - 30 km/s (indicative
of a warm component), which may indicate a common origin and/or physical
process breaking down the clouds. The clouds cataloged at the tail of Complex C
extend over a mass range of 10^1.1 to 10^4.8 solar masses, sizes of 10^1.2 to
10^2.6 pc, and have a median volume density of 0.065 cm^(-3) and median
pressure of (P/k) = 580 K cm^{-3}. We do not see a prominent two-phase
structure in Complex C, possibly due to its low metallicity and inefficient
cooling compared to other halo clouds. From assuming the Complex C clouds are
in pressure equilibrium with a hot halo medium, we find a median halo density
of 5.8 x 10^(-4) cm^(-3), which given a constant distance of 10 kpc, is at a
z-height of ~3 kpc. Using the same argument for the Stream results in a median
halo density of 8.4 x 10^(-5) x (60kpc/d) cm^(-3). These densities are
consistent with previous observational constraints and cosmological

subjected to intense heating/tidal forces from their parent stars.
Atomic/ionized hydrogen (H) layers are sufficiently rarefied that magnetic
pressure may dominate gas pressure for expected planetary magnetic field
strength. We examine the magnetospheric structure using a 3D isothermal
magnetohydrodynamic model that includes: a static ""dead zone"" near the magnetic
equator containing magnetically confined gas; a ""wind zone"" outside the
magnetic equator in which thermal pressure gradients and the
magneto-centrifugal-tidal effect give rise to transonic outflow; and a region
near the poles where sufficiently strong tidal forces may suppress transonic
outflow. Using dipole field geometry, we estimate the size of the dead zone to
be ~1-10 planetary radii for a range of parameters. To understand appropriate
base conditions for the 3D isothermal model, we compute a 1D thermal model in
which photoelectric heating from the stellar Lyman continuum is balanced by
collisionally-excited Lyman {\alpha} cooling. This 1D model exhibits a H layer
with temperatures T=5000-10000K down to pressures of 10-100 nbar. Using the 3D
isothermal model, we compute H column densities and Lyman {\alpha} transmission
spectra for parameters appropriate to HD 209458b. Line-integrated transit
depths of 5-10% can be achieved for the above base conditions. Strong magnetic
fields increase the transit signal while decreasing the mass loss, due to
higher covering fraction and density of the dead zone. In our model, most of
the transit signal arises from magnetically confined gas, some of which may be
outside the L1 equipotential. Hence the presence of gas outside the L1
equipotential does not directly imply mass loss. Lastly, we discuss the domain
of applicability for the magnetic wind model described in this paper and in the
Roche-lobe overflow model.

sum-utility under a sum-power constraint. In doing so, we consider a family of
generic goodput-based utilities that facilitate, e.g., throughput-based
pricing, quality-of-service enforcement, and/or the treatment of practical
modulation-and-coding schemes (MCS). Since perfect knowledge of channel state
information (CSI) may be difficult to maintain at the base-station, especially
when the number of users and/or subchannels is large, we consider scheduling
and resource allocation under imperfect CSI, where the channel state is
described by a generic probability distribution. First, we consider the
""continuous"" case where multiple users and/or code rates can time-share a
single OFDMA subchannel and time slot. This yields a non-convex optimization
problem that we convert into a convex optimization problem and solve exactly
using a dual optimization approach. Second, we consider the ""discrete"" case
where only a single user and code rate is allowed per OFDMA subchannel per time
slot. For the mixed-integer optimization problem that arises, we discuss the
connections it has with the continuous case and show that it can solved exactly
in some situations. For the other situations, we present a bound on the
optimality gap. For both cases, we provide algorithmic implementations of the
obtained solution. Finally, we study, numerically, the performance of the
proposed algorithms under various degrees of CSI uncertainty, utilities, and
OFDMA system configurations. In addition, we demonstrate advantages relative to
existing state-of-the-art algorithms.

one-sided Brownian motion without drift can be characterized by a jump process
with independent increments, which is the inverse of the process of slopes of
the least concave majorant. This result can be used to prove the result of
Sparre Andersen (1954) that the number of vertices of the smallest concave
majorant of the empirical distribution function of a sample of size n from the
uniform distribution on [0,1] is asymptotically normal, with an asymptotic
expectation and variance which are both of order log n. A similar (Markovian)
inverse jump process was introduced in Groeneboom (1989), in an analysis of the
least concave majorant of two-sided Brownian motion with a parabolic drift.
This process is quite different from the process for one-sided Brownian motion
without drift: the number of vertices in a (corresponding slopes) interval has
an expectation proportional to the length of the interval and the variance of
the number of vertices in such an interval is about half the size of the
expectation, if the length of the interval tends to infinity. We prove an
asymptotic normality result for the number of vertices in an increasing
interval, which translates into a corresponding result for the least concave
majorant of an empirical distribution function of a sample of size n, generated
by a strictly concave distribution function. In this case the number of
vertices is of order cube root n, and the variance is again about half the size
of the asymptotic expectation. As a side result we obtain some interesting
relations between the first moments of the number of vertices, the square of
the location of the maximum of Brownian motion minus a parabola, the value of
the maximum itself, the squared slope of the least concave majorant at zero,
and the value of the least concave majorant at zero.

investigate the influence of both the epoch of AGN (z $\sim$ 3-0.5) and the AGN
energy ($\sim$ 3 $\times$ 10$^{57}$ - 2 $\times$ 10$^{60}$ ergs)on the final
magnetic field distribution in a relatively massive cluster (M$_{vir}$
$\sim$10$^{15}$ M$_\odot$). We find that as long as the AGN magnetic fields are
ejected before the major mergers in the cluster formation history, magnetic
fields can be transported throughout the cluster and can be further amplified
by the intra-cluster medium (ICM) turbulence cause by hierarchical mergers
during the cluster formation process. The total magnetic energy in the cluster
can reach $\sim$ $10^{61}$ ergs, with micro Gauss fields distributed over
$\sim$ Mpc scale. The amplification of the total magnetic energy by the ICM
turbulence can be significant, up to $\sim$1000 times in some cases. Therefore
even weak magnetic fields from AGNs can be used to magnetize the cluster to the
observed level. The final magnetic energy in the ICM is determined by the ICM
turbulent energy, with a weak dependence on the AGN injection energy. We
discuss the properties of magnetic fields throughout the cluster and the
synthetic Faraday rotation measure maps they produce. We also show that high
spatial resolution over most of the magnetic regions of the cluster is very
important to capture the small scale dynamo process and maintain the magnetic

particular the definition of temperature and the equivalence of ensemble, which
are much more difficult to show numerically even though we believe they are
essential to the discussion of thermalization. These remarks could be of

s-wave scattering length assuming a harmonic confinement potential. We also
compute the low-energy scattering parameters in the p-wave channel (scattering
volume and effective momentum) that are necessary for the low-energy effective
theory of the p-wave resonance. We point out that some of the resonances
observed in the Florence group experiment [Phys. Rev. Lett. 104, 153202 (2010)]

matter waves under p-wave resonant scatterers.

dark matter and particle acceleration in SNR shocks, rely heavily on studies of
cosmic rays (CRs) and associated diffuse emissions (radio, microwave, X-rays,
gamma rays). While very detailed numerical models of CR propagation exist, a
quantitative statistical analysis of such models has been so far hampered by
the large computational effort that those models require. Although statistical
analyses have been carried out before using semi-analytical models (where the
computation is much faster), the evaluation of the results obtained from such
models is difficult, as they necessarily suffer from many simplifying
assumptions, The main objective of this paper is to present a working method
for a full Bayesian parameter estimation for a numerical CR propagation model.
For this study, we use the GALPROP code, the most advanced of its kind, that
uses astrophysical information, nuclear and particle data as input to
self-consistently predict CRs, gamma rays, synchrotron and other observables.
We demonstrate that a full Bayesian analysis is possible using nested sampling
and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods (implemented in the SuperBayeS code)
despite the heavy computational demands of a numerical propagation code. The
best-fit values of parameters found in this analysis are in agreement with
previous, significantly simpler, studies also based on GALPROP.

linear temporal difference reinforcement learning with subspace identification.
In practical applications, reinforcement learning (RL) is complicated by the
fact that state is either high-dimensional or partially observable. Therefore,
RL methods are designed to work with features of state rather than state
itself, and the success or failure of learning is often determined by the
suitability of the selected features. By comparison, subspace identification
(SSID) methods are designed to select a feature set which preserves as much
information as possible about state. In this paper we connect the two
approaches, looking at the problem of reinforcement learning with a large set
of features, each of which may only be marginally useful for value function
approximation. We introduce a new algorithm for this situation, called
Predictive State Temporal Difference (PSTD) learning. As in SSID for predictive
state representations, PSTD finds a linear compression operator that projects a
large set of features down to a small set that preserves the maximum amount of
predictive information. As in RL, PSTD then uses a Bellman recursion to
estimate a value function. We discuss the connection between PSTD and prior
approaches in RL and SSID. We prove that PSTD is statistically consistent,
perform several experiments that illustrate its properties, and demonstrate its
potential on a difficult optimal stopping problem.

superconductors exhibit a tetragonal to orthorhombic structural transition
(i.e. a broken C4 symmetry) that either precedes or is coincident with a
collinear spin density wave (SDW) transition in undoped parent compounds, and
superconductivity arises when both transitions are suppressed via doping.
Evidence for strong in-plane anisotropy in the SDW state in this family of
compounds has been reported by neutron scattering, scanning tunneling
microscopy, and transport measurements. Here we present an angle resolved
photoemission spectroscopy study of detwinned single crystals of a
representative family of electron-doped iron-arsenide superconductors,
Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2 in the underdoped region. The crystals were detwinned via
application of in-plane uniaxial stress, enabling measurements of single domain
electronic structure in the orthorhombic state. At low temperatures, our
results clearly demonstrate an in-plane electronic anisotropy characterized by
a large energy splitting of two orthogonal bands with dominant dxz and dyz
character, which is consistent with anisotropy observed by other probes. For
compositions x>0, for which the structural transition (TS) precedes the
magnetic transition (TSDW), an anisotropic splitting is observed to develop
above TSDW, indicating that it is specifically associated with TS. For
unstressed crystals, the band splitting is observed close to TS, whereas for
stressed crystals the splitting is observed to considerably higher
temperatures, revealing the presence of a surprisingly large in-plane nematic

introduced as a class of distributed parallel computing devices inspired by the
observation that any biological system is a complex hierarchical structure,
with a flow of biochemical substances and information that underlies their
functioning. The modeling and analysis of biological systems has also attracted
considerable interest of the process algebra research community. Thus the
notions of membranes and compartments have been explicitly represented in a
family of calculi, such as ambients and brane calculi. A cross fertilization of
these two research areas has recently started. A deeper investigation of the
relationships between these related formalisms is interesting, as it is
important to understand the crucial similarities and the differences. The main

physical conditions within the observed areas are inferred from spectroscopic
data obtained from IRS and from SWS and LWS onboard ISO, together with
photometric data from Spitzer's Infrared Array Camera (IRAC). Adopting a
power-law distribution for the gas temperature in the observed region, the H2

gas density, yielding estimated n(H2) in the range 2-4*10^3 cm^-3. The
excitation of H2 S(9) to S(12) and high-J CO pure rotational lines, however,
require environments several times denser. The inconsistency among the best-fit
densities estimated from different species can be explained by density
fluctuations within the observed regions. The best-fit power-law index b is
smaller than the value 3.8 predicted for a paraboloidal C-type bow shock,
suggesting that the shock front has a ""flatter"" shape than that of a

differ significantly between the two classes of sources, except that for the

trace the hot component of the gas, while the intensities of S(6) and S(7) are

invariant theory as an intermediate result, where the conformal anomalies must
be constrained to cancel out. When the residual metric is treated as a

lagrangian should have a vanishing beta function. The zeros of this beta
function are isolated points in the landscape of quantum field theories, and so
we arrive at a denumerable, or perhaps even finite, set of quantum theories for

active regions. Richardson has described the interplay between large and small
scales and the phenomena so described are known as the Richardson cascade. This

we use the explicit map method to analyze the nonlinear dynamical behavior for
cascade in isotropic turbulence. This deductive scale analysis is shown to
provide the first visual evidence of the celebrated Richardson cascade, and
reveals in particular its multiscale character. The results also indicate that
the energy cascading process has remarkable similarities with the deterministic
construction rules of the logistic map. Cascade of period-doubling bifurcations
have been seen in this isotropic turbulent systems that exhibit chaotic
behavior. The `cascade' appears as an infinite sequence of period-doubling
bifurcations.

called spin-orbit interaction. This interaction provides a way to electrically
control spins and as such lies at the foundation of spintronics. Even at the
level of single electrons, spin-orbit interaction has proven promising for
coherent spin rotations. Here we report a spin-orbit quantum bit implemented in
an InAs nanowire, where spin-orbit interaction is so strong that spin and
motion can no longer be separated. In this regime we realize fast qubit
rotations and universal single qubit control using only electric fields. We
enhance coherence by dynamically decoupling the qubit from the environment. Our
qubits are individually addressable: they are hosted in single-electron quantum
dots, each of which has a different Land\'e g-factor. The demonstration of a
nanowire qubit opens ways to harness the advantages of nanowires for use in
quantum computing. Nanowires can serve as one-dimensional templates for
scalable qubit registers. Unique to nanowires is the possibility to easily vary
the material even during wire growth. Such flexibility can be used to design
wires with suppressed decoherence and push semiconductor qubit fidelities
towards error-correction levels. Furthermore, electrical dots can be integrated
with optical dots in p-n junction nanowires. The coherence times achieved here
are sufficient for the conversion of an electronic qubit into a photon, the

positioning method based on the use of pulsed signals from sources at infinity,
we present an application example reconstructing the world-line of an idealized
Earth in the reference frame of distant pulsars. The method considers the null
four-vectors built from the period of the pulses and the direction cosines of
the propagation from each source. Starting from a simplified problem (a
receiver at rest) we have been able to calibrate our procedure, evidencing the
influence of the uncertainty on the arrival times of the pulses as measured by
the receiver, and of the numerical treatment of the data. The most relevant
parameter turns out to be the accuracy of the clock used by the receiver.
Actually the uncertainty used in the simulations combines both the accuracy of
the clock and the fluctuations in the sources. As an evocative example the
method has then been applied to the case of an ideal observer moving as a point
on the surface of the Earth. The input have been the simulated arrival times of
the signals from four pulsars at the location of the Parkes radiotelescope in
Australia. Some substantial simplifications have been made both excluding the
problems of visibility due to the actual size of the planet, and the behaviour
of the sources. A rough application of the method to a three days run gives a
correct result with a poor accuracy. The accuracy is then enhanced to the order
of a few hundred meters if a continuous set of data is assumed. The method
could actually be used for navigation across the solar system and be based on
artificial sources, rather than pulsars. The viability of the method, whose
additional value is in the self-sufficiency, i.e. independence from any control
from other operators, has been confirmed.

mechanism for exhibiting accelerating universe. Chameleon field has several
interesting aspects, such as field dependence on the local matter density. For
this model we introduce a new kind of potential which has run away form and
satisfies chameleon constraints. The results are acceptable in comparison with
the other potentials which studied up to now.

otherwise. We survey the main ingredients in several known proofs. Then we give
an elementary proof, using an identity for power sums proven by Pascal in 1654.
An application is a simple proof of a congruence for certain sums of binomial
coefficients, due to Hermite and Bachmann.

analysis of the preferred regions of the Minimal supersymmetric extension of
the Standard Model with universal soft supersymmetry breaking (the CMSSM) and a
model with equal but non-universal supersymmetry-breaking contributions to the
Higgs masses (the NUHM1). LHC searches may have good chances to observe
supersymmetry in the near future - and so may direct searches for astrophysical

friction between two solids and the statistic characterization of vibrating
granular media. Here we analyze the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation
including both velocity and spatial components, exhibiting a formal connection
to a quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator in the presence of a delta
potential. Numerical solutions for the resulting spatial displacement
statistics show a crossover from exponential to Gaussian displacement
statistics. We identify a transient intermediate regime that exhibits
multiscaling properties arising from the contribution of Coulombic friction.
The possible role of these effects during observations in diffusion experiments
is shortly discussed.

in the context of coupled Dark Energy cosmologies where a component of massive
neutrinos is also present. We focus on the effects of both the coupling between
Dark Matter and Dark Energy and of the neutrino mass on the cross-correlation
between galaxy/quasar distributions and ISW effect. We provide a simple
expression to appropriately rescale the galaxy bias when comparing different
cosmologies. Theoretical predictions of the cross-correlation function are then
compared with observational data. We find that, while it is not possible to
distinguish among the models at low redshifts, discrepancies between coupled
models and $\Lambda$CDM increase with $z$. In spite of this, current data alone
seems not able to distinguish between coupled models and $\Lambda$CDM. However,
we show that upcoming galaxy surveys will permit tomographic analysis which
allow to better discriminate among the models. We discuss the effects on
cross-correlation measurements of ignoring galaxy bias evolution, b(z), and
magnification bias correction and provide fitting formulae for b(z) for the
cosmologies considered. We compare three different tomographic schemes and
investigate how the expected signal to noise ratio, snr, of the ISW-LSS
cross-correlation changes when increasing the number of tomographic bins. The
dependence of snr on the area of the survey and the survey shot noise is also
discussed.
