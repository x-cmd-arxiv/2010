dynamic treatment strategies on the basis of observational data. We formulate
this within a probabilistic decision-theoretic framework. Our approach is
compared with related work by Robins and others: in particular, we show how
Robins's 'G-computation' algorithm arises naturally from this
decision-theoretic perspective. Careful attention is paid to the mathematical
and substantive conditions required to justify the use of this formula. These
conditions revolve around a property we term stability, which relates the
probabilistic behaviours of observational and interventional regimes. We show
how an assumption of 'sequential randomization' (or 'no unmeasured
confounders'), or an alternative assumption of 'sequential irrelevance', can be
used to infer stability. Probabilistic influence diagrams are used to simplify
manipulations, and their power and limitations are discussed. We compare our
approach with alternative formulations based on causal DAGs or potential
response models. We aim to show that formulating the problem of assessing
dynamic treatment strategies as a problem of decision analysis brings clarity,
simplicity and generality.

of interference to minimize the time for satisfying all requests. We study here
the combined problem of scheduling and power control, where we seek both an
assignment of power settings and a partition of the links so that each set
satisfies the signal-to-interference-plus-noise (SINR) constraints.
  We give an algorithm that attains an approximation ratio of $O(\log n \cdot
\log\log \Delta)$, where $n$ is the number of links and $\Delta$ is the ratio
between the longest and the shortest link length. Under the natural assumption
that lengths are represented in binary, this gives the first approximation
ratio that is polylogarithmic in the size of the input. The algorithm has the
desirable property of using an oblivious power assignment, where the power
assigned to a sender depends only on the length of the link. We give evidence
that this dependence on $\Delta$ is unavoidable, showing that any
reasonably-behaving oblivious power assignment results in a $\Omega(\log\log
\Delta)$-approximation.
  These results hold also for the (weighted) capacity problem of finding a
maximum (weighted) subset of links that can be scheduled in a single time slot.
In addition, we obtain improved approximation for a bidirectional variant of
the scheduling problem, give partial answers to questions about the utility of
graphs for modeling physical interference, and generalize the setting from the
standard 2-dimensional Euclidean plane to doubling metrics. Finally, we explore
the utility of graph models in capturing wireless interference.

  comments by referee in version 3","Seminaire Lotharingien de Combinatoire, B64d (2011), 44 pp",,,"math.RT math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In 1979, Norton showed that the representation theory of the 0-Hecke algebra
admits a rich combinatorial description. Her constructions rely heavily on some
triangularity property of the product, but do not use explicitly that the
0-Hecke algebra is a monoid algebra.
  The thesis of this paper is that considering the general setting of monoids
admitting such a triangularity, namely J-trivial monoids, sheds further light
on the topic. This is a step to use representation theory to automatically
extract combinatorial structures from (monoid) algebras, often in the form of
posets and lattices, both from a theoretical and computational point of view,
and with an implementation in Sage.
  Motivated by ongoing work on related monoids associated to Coxeter systems,
and building on well-known results in the semi-group community (such as the
description of the simple modules or the radical), we describe how most of the
data associated to the representation theory (Cartan matrix, quiver) of the
algebra of any J-trivial monoid M can be expressed combinatorially by counting
appropriate elements in M itself. As a consequence, this data does not depend
on the ground field and can be calculated in O(n^2), if not O(nm), where n=|M|
and m is the number of generators. Along the way, we construct a triangular
decomposition of the identity into orthogonal idempotents, using the usual
M\""obius inversion formula in the semi-simple quotient (a lattice), followed by
an algorithmic lifting step.
  Applying our results to the 0-Hecke algebra (in all finite types), we recover
previously known results and additionally provide an explicit labeling of the
edges of the quiver. We further explore special classes of J-trivial monoids,
and in particular monoids of order preserving regressive functions on a poset,
generalizing known results on the monoids of nondecreasing parking functions.

crucial observation that the S-parameter can be computed exactly near the upper

Minimal Walking Technicolor (MWT) models. In the second part of this review we
consider the interesting possibility to marry supersymmetry and technicolor.
The reason is to provide a unification of different extensions of the standard
model. For example, this means that one can recover, according to the
parameters and spectrum of the theory distinct extensions of the standard
model, from supersymmetry to technicolor and unparticle physiscs. A surprising
result is that a minimal (in terms of the smallest number of fields)

be infalling to the cluster for the first time, or have already visited the
cluster core and are coming back out again. This latter population of galaxies
is known as the backsplash population. Differentiating them from the infalling
population presents an interesting challenge for observational studies of
galaxy evolution. To attempt to do this, we assemble a sample of 14 redshift-
and spatially-isolated galaxy clusters from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We
clean this sample of cluster-cluster mergers to ensure that the galaxies
contained within them are (to an approximation) only backsplashing from the
centre of their parent clusters and are not being processed in sub-clumps. By
stacking them together to form a composite cluster, we find evidence for both
categories of galaxies at intermediate radii from the cluster centre.
Application of mixture modelling to this sample then serves to differentiate
the infalling galaxies (which we model on galaxies from the cluster outskirts)
from the backsplash ones (which we model on galaxies in the high density core
with low velocity offsets from the cluster mean). We find that the fraction of
galaxies with populations similar to the low velocity cluster core galaxies is
f = -0.052R/R_virial + 0.612 +/- 0.06 which we interpret as being the
backsplash population fraction at 1<R/R_virial<2. Although some interlopers may
be affecting our results, the results are demonstrated to be in concordance
with earlier studies in this area that support density-related mechanisms as
being the prime factor in determining the star formation rate of a galaxy.

of ~42%. While our observations are sensitive to the WNM with a spin
temperature T_s<3000 K, we detected only two wide absorption lines with
T_s=400-900 K. These temperatures lie above the range allowed for the cold
neutral medium (CNM) by the thermal equilbrium models and signify the thermally

where the temperatures are cool enough for their cores to condense. They then
migrate inwards to their current observed orbital separations. Different
theories of how this migration occurs lead to varying distributions of orbital
eccentricity and the alignment between the rotation axis of the star and the
orbital axis of the planet. The spin-orbit alignment of a transiting system is
revealed via the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, which is the anomaly present in
the radial velocity measurements of the rotating star during transit due to the
planet blocking some of the starlight. In this paper we aim to measure the
spin-orbit alignment of the WASP-3 system via a new way of analysing the
Rossiter-McLaughlin observations. We apply a new tomographic method for
analysing the time variable asymmetry of stellar line profiles caused by the
Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. This new method eliminates the systematic error
inherent in previous methods used to analyse the effect. We find a value for
the projected stellar spin rate of v sin i = 13.9 \pm 0.03 km/s which is in
agreement with previous measurements but has a much higher precision. The
system is found to be well aligned which favours an evolutionary history for
WASP-3b involving migration through tidal interactions with a protoplanetary
disc. Using gyrochronology we estimate the age of the star to be ~300 Myr with
an upper limit of 2 Gyr from comparison with isochrones.

especially written for the community of mathematicians, physicists and
engineers who do research on J. F. Colombeau' theory of new generalized
functions and its applications. The main purpose of our non-standard approach
to Colombeau' theory is the improvement of the properties of the scalars of the
varieties of spaces of generalized functions: in our non-standard approach the
sets of scalars of the functional spaces always form algebraically closed
non-archimedean Cantor complete fields. In contrast, the scalars of the
functional spaces in Colombeau's theory are rings with zero divisors. The
improvement of the scalars leads to other improvements and simplifications of
Colombeau's theory such as reducing the number of quantifiers and possibilities
for an axiomatization of the theory. Some of the algebras we construct in these
notes have already counterparts in Colombeau's theory, other seems to be
without counterpart. We present applications of the theory to PDE and
mathematical physics. Although our approach is directed mostly to Colombeau's
community, the readers who are already familiar with non-standard methods might
also find a short and comfortable way to learn about Colombeau's theory: a new
branch of functional analysis which naturally generalizes the Schwartz theory
of distributions with numerous applications to partial differential equations,
differential geometry, relativity theory and other areas of mathematics and
physics.

matter action is invariant under global scale transformations in arbitrary
dimensions. However the gravitational action breaks scale invariance
explicitly. The scale symmetry is broken spontaneously in the matter sector of
the theory. We show that the contribution to the vacuum energy and hence the
cosmological constant is identically zero from the matter sector within the
full quantum theory. However the gravitational sector may give non-zero
contributions to the cosmological constant at loop orders. No fine tuning may
be required at loop orders since the matter sector gives zero contribution to
the cosmological constant. We also show that we do not require full scale
invariance in order to constrain the vacuum energy from the matter sector. We
only require invariance under pseudoscale transformations. Using this idea and
motivated by the concept of unimodular gravity we propose an alternative model.
In this case also we show that matter sector gives exactly zero contribution to

depends on the ration between the peak voltage and the maximum coupling

investigated and it is shown that there is a relatively large tolerance range

analysis of two particle collision as dictated by the formulation, as well as
the case of a particle rebouncing from an insurmountable potential barrier in

creation and annihilation as interpreted in a the usual time evolution picture
can be obtained, in the simple classical mechanics setting. We consider that a
nontrivial success of the theory, giving confidence that the whole background
approach is sensible and plausibly on the right track. We also sketch the
quantum mechanics formulation, direct from the familiar canoincal quantization,
matching to a relativity group geometric quantization formulation in a previous

are obtained on both a sphere and a finite lattice, in each case enabling a
more fundamental description of pure spin states than that previously given by
Wigner functions. In each case the Wigner function can be expressed as the star

interpretation of amplitudes that emphasizes their more fundamental status. The
ordinary product of the amplitude and its conjugate produces a (generalized)

shown that phase space amplitudes on the sphere transform correctly as spinors
under under rotations, despite their expression in terms of spherical

by hypodermic needles, at an altitude of 3.61 m above a still freshwater
surface. High resolution high speed videos (0.13 mm/pixel, 500 frames/second)

the usually observed cavity, canopy and coronet (Prosperetti et al. 1993),
drops of diameters typically greater than 3.8 mm consistently generated
toroidal (donut-shaped) air bubbles upon impact at the water surface. Videos of
the dynamics of the impingement were successively taken from different angles,
and with a 105 mm lens focused on different regions of the event. These allowed
for a qualitative description and hypothetical explanation of the observed
phenomena, which are presented alongside the actual video footage, in the
hereby displayed fluid dynamics video. The video displays a cartoon of the
experimental setup, followed by two simultaneously running videoclips of the
drop impact upon the water surface, from 2 different viewpoints (front and
top). As the event occurs over less than 1 second, the videos were slowed down
to a frame rate of 12 frames/sec. The footage suggests that the air is trapped
by the converging rim (or coronet) of the closing canopy. The very bottom of
the cavity then rises rapidly, and collides with the falling water mass
provided by the fully converged canopy rim. This incidentally prevents the
formation of a secondary jet. The center (or donut hole) of the unstable
toroidal air bubble eventually moves outward, thus yielding a hemispherical air
bubble.

find 14 sources with significant X-ray detections. For most of these there are
only photometric redshifts available, with their median redshift being ~2.3.
Taking into account only the CDFS area which has the deepest X-ray

X-ray spectral properties of the majority of the X-ray AGN which are associated
with SMGs are consistent with high obscuration, 10^23 cm-2, but there is no
unambiguous evidence for the presence of Compton-thick sources. Detailed
Spectral Energy Distribution fittings show that the bulk of total IR luminosity
originates in star-forming processes, although a torus component is usually
present. Finally, stacking analysis of the X-ray undetected SMGs reveals a
signal in the soft (0.5-2 keV) and marginally in the hard (2-5 keV) X-ray band.
The hardness ratio of the stacked signal is relatively soft (-0.40+/-0.10)

the same numerical grid, the Einstein elliptic equations are treated by
resorting to spherical harmonics decomposition and solved, for each harmonic,

different from other extreme HI disks in the local universe, it is a luminous
infrared galaxy (LIRG) with an actively star forming disk (>50 kpc), central to
its ~ 130 kpc gas disk, with a total star formation rate (SFR) of ~20.5 Msun
yr^{-1}. Spitzer spectroscopy reveals an unusual combination of powerful
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission coupled to a relatively weak
warm dust continuum, suggesting photodissociation region (PDR)-dominated
emission. Compared to a typical LIRG with similar total infrared luminosity
(L_TIR=10^11 Lsun), the PAHs in HIZOA J0836-43 are more than twice as strong,
whereas the warm dust continuum (lambda > 20micron) is best fit by a star
forming galaxy with L_TIR=10^10 Lsun. Mopra CO observations suggest an extended
molecular gas component (H_2 + He > 3.7x10^9 Msun) and a lower limit of ~ 64%
for the gas mass fraction; this is above average compared to local disk
systems, but similar to that of z~1.5 BzK galaxies (~57%). However, the star
formation efficiency (SFE = L_IR/L'_CO) for HIZOA J0836-43 of 140 Lsun (K km
s^{-1} pc^2)^{-1} is similar to that of local spirals and other disk galaxies
at high redshift, in strong contrast to the increased SFE seen in merging and
strongly interacting systems. HIZOA J0836-43 is actively forming stars and
building a massive stellar disk. Its evolutionary phase of star formation
(M_stellar, SFR, gas fraction) compared to more distant systems suggests that
it would be considered typical at redshift z~1. This galaxy provides a rare
opportunity in the nearby universe for studying (at z~0.036) how disks were
building and galaxies evolving at z~1, when similarly large gas fractions were
likely more common.

job describing the UE data at 900 GeV and 7 TeV. However, the modeling of
""min-bias"" at the LHC (i.e. the overall inelastic cross section) is a very
different story. No model describes all the features of ""min-bias"" collisions

homeomorphism of the annulus $\mathbb{A}=\mathbb{S}^1 \times [-1,1]$ isotopic
to the identity and with at most one fixed point. This generalizes the
classical Poincar\'e-Birkhoff theorem because this property certainly does not
hold for an area preserving homeomorphism of $\mathbb{A}$ with the usual
boundary twist condition. We also have two corollaries of this result. The
first one shows in particular that the boundary twist assumption may be
weakened by demanding that the homeomorphism $h$ has a lift $H$ to the strip
$\widetilde{\mathbb{A}} = \mathbb{R} \times [-1,1]$ possessing both a forward
orbit unbounded on the right and a forward orbit unbounded on the the left. As
a second corollary we get a new proof of a version of the Conley-Zehnder
theorem in $\mathbb{A}$: if a homeomorphism of $\mathbb{A}$ isotopic to the
identity preserves the area and has mean rotation zero, then it possesses two
fixed points.

Way disk is surrounded by an extended halo of neutral gas with a vertical
scale-height of 1.6[+0.6/-0.4] kpc and an HI mass of 3.2[+1.0/-0.9]x10^8 solar

contraction. The lattice constant of the Ce compound reveals the presence of
Ce$^{4+}$ leading to the composition Ce$_{1/2}$Cu$_3$Ti$_4$O$_{12}$. From
magnetic susceptibility and electron-spin resonance experiments it can be
concluded that the copper ions always carry a spin $S=1/2$ and order
antiferromagnetically close to 25\,K. The Curie-Weiss temperatures can
approximately be calculated assuming a two-sublattice model corresponding to
the copper and lanthanide ions, respectively. It seems that the magnetic
moments of the heavy rare earths are weakly coupled to the copper spins, while
for the light lanthanides no such coupling was found. The $4f$ moments remain
paramagnetic down to the lowest temperatures, with the exception of the Tm
compound, which indicates enhanced Van-Vleck magnetism due to a non-magnetic
singlet ground state of the crystal-field split $4f$ manifold. From
specific-heat measurements we accurately determined the antiferromagnetic
ordering temperature and obtained information on the crystal-field states of
the rare-earth ions. The heat-capacity results also revealed the presence of a
small fraction of Ce$^{3+}$ in a magnetic $4f^1$ state.

location of the critical point and the critical exponents. For Ising-like
systems without quenched disorder, $P_L(m)$ becomes scale invariant at the
critical point, where it assumes a characteristic bimodal shape featuring two
overlapping peaks. In particular, the ratio between the value of $P_L(m)$ at
the peaks ($P_{L, max}$) and the value at the minimum in-between ($P_{L, min}$)
becomes $L$-independent at criticality. However, for Ising-like systems with

the scaling of $\Delta F_L$ with system size should be easily detectable in

evidence that fluids with quenched disorder belong to the universality class of

single direction by the presence of an anisotropic bulk cosmological constant.
The Einstein equations are solved, giving rise to a range of possible spaces in
which the $\delta$ additional spaces are warped. Here we consider models in
which the gauge fields are free to propagate into such spaces. After carrying
out the Kaluza Klein (KK) decomposition of such fields it is found that the KK
mass spectrum changes significantly depending on how the $\delta$ additional
dimensions are warped. We proceed to compute the lower bound on the KK mass
scale from electroweak observables for models with a bulk $SU(2)\times U(1)$
gauge symmetry and models with a bulk $SU(2)_R\times SU(2)_L\times U(1)$ gauge
symmetry. It is found that in both cases the most favourable bounds are
approximately $M_{KK}\gtrsim 2$ TeV, corresponding to a mass of the first gauge
boson excitation of about 4-6 TeV. Hence additional warped dimensions offer a
new way of reducing the constraints on the KK scale.

introduced as a simple but effective improvement to slotted ALOHA. It relies on
MAC burst repetitions and on interference cancellation to increase the
normalized throughput of a classic slotted ALOHA access scheme. CRDSA allows
achieving a larger throughput than slotted ALOHA, at the price of an increased
average transmitted power. A way to trade-off the increment of the average
transmitted power and the improvement of the throughput is presented in this
paper. Specifically, it is proposed to divide each MAC burst in k sub-bursts,
and to encode them via a (n,k) erasure correcting code. The n encoded
sub-bursts are transmitted over the MAC channel, according to specific
time/frequency-hopping patterns. Whenever n-e>=k sub-bursts (of the same burst)
are received without collisions, erasure decoding allows recovering the
remaining e sub-bursts (which were lost due to collisions). An interference
cancellation process can then take place, removing in e slots the interference
caused by the e recovered sub-bursts, possibly allowing the correct decoding of
sub-bursts related to other bursts. The process is thus iterated as for the
CRDSA case.

regularity behavior of the empirical process based on scalar diffusions as
compared to the classical empirical process, due to the existence of diffusion

Ossiander's bracketing CLT and the general Gin\'e-Zinn CLT for uniformly
bounded families of functions, we find increased regularity also for
multivariate ergodic diffusions, assuming that the invariant measure is finite

place with even exponentially small bandwidth in dimension $d=2$, and with
strongly undersmoothing bandwidth choice for parameters $\beta > d/2$ in case

infrared dark cloud (IRDC).
  By observing the spatial distribution of the [CI] emission in an IRDC,
comparing it with the 13CO emission and the known distribution of internal
heating sources, we can quantify the role of internal and external UV
irradiation in the production of atomic carbon.
  We used the 2x4 pixel SMART receiver of the KOSMA observatory on Gornergrat
to map the [CI] 3P1 - 3P0 line in the IRDC G48.65-0.29 and compared the
resulting spectra with data from the BU-FCRAO 13CO 1-0 Galactic Ring Survey.
  The [CI]/13CO effective beam temperature ratio falls at about 0.3 with local
deviations by less than a factor two. All velocity components seen in 13CO are
also detected in[CI]. We find, however, significant differences in the
morphology of the brightest regions seen in the two tracers. While 13CO
basically follows the column density distribution derived from the
near-infrared (NIR) extinction and the submm continuum, the [CI] emission peaks
at the locations of the two known NIR point sources. We find CI/CO abundance
ratios between 0.07 and 0.13, matching the lower end of the range previously
measured in star-forming regions.
  Evaluating the relative importance of the irradiation by embedded sources and
by the Galactic interstellar UV field, we find that in G48.65-0.29 most [CI]
emission can be attributed to externally illuminated surfaces. Embedded sources
have a significant impact on the overall abundance distribution of atomic
carbon as soon as they are found in an evolved state with noticeable NIR flux.

We find that for large anisotropy parameter the quantum phase transition can be
indicated by the dynamics of classical correlation between the nearest neighbor
sites. We find that the dynamics of entanglement for both the nearest and
next-nearest neighbor sites show significantly different behaviors with
different values of magnetic field. We also find that the evolution of quantum
correlation and classical correlation of the nearest neighbor sites are
obviously different from those of the next-nearest neighbor sites.

wide range of oscillation frequencies. The behavior of the quantum transmission
coefficient is affected by tunneling phenomena, resonances and kinematic
effects emanating from the time dependence of the potential. We show that when
kinematic effects dominate (mainly in intermediate frequencies), classical
mechanics provides very good approximation of quantum results. Moreover, in the
frequency region of optimal agreement between classical and quantum
transmission coefficient, the transmission threshold, i.e. the energy above
which the transmission coefficient becomes larger than a specific small
threshold value, is found to exhibit a minimum. We also consider the form of
the transmitted wave packet and we find that for low values of the frequency
the incoming classical and quantum wave packet can be split into a train of
well separated coherent pulses, a phenomenon which can admit purely classical
kinematic interpretation.

recombination problem for hydrogen is described using an effective 400-shell

to a delay in recombination by DN_e/N_e~0.9% at z~920. Two-photon decay and
Raman scattering from higher levels (n>3) result in a small additional

Whitney-Nedelec-Bossavit-Kotiuga interpolation. All coarse-grained fields are
defined via Whitney forms and satisfy Maxwell's equations exactly. The new

agrees well with the established results (e.g. the Maxwell-Garnett formula and
the zero cell-size limit) within the range of applicability of the latter. The

the polar regions of the gravitating body in question. This places the ASTG on
an interesting pedestal to infer the origins of outflows as a repulsive
gravitational phenomenon. Outflows are a ubiquitous phenomenon found in star
forming systems and their true origin is a question yet to be settled. Given
the current thinking on their origin, the direction that the present paper
takes is nothing short of an asymptotic break from conventional wisdom; at the
very least, it is a complete paradigm shift because gravitation is not at all
associated with this process, but rather it is thought to be an all-attractive
force that only tries to squash matter together onto a single point.
Additionally, we show that the emergent Azimuthally Symmetric Gravitational
Field from the ASTG strongly suggests a solution to the supposed Radiation
Problem that is thought to be faced by massive stars in their process of
formation. That is, at about 8-10Msun radiation from the nascent star is
expected to halt the accretion of matter. We show that in-falling material will
fall onto the equatorial disk and from there, this material will be channeled
onto the forming star via the equatorial plane, thus accretion of mass
continues well past the value of about 8-10Msun, albeit via the disk. Along the
equatorial plane, the net force (with the radiation force included) on any
material there-on right up to the surface of the star is directed toward the
forming star, hence accretion of mass by the nascent star is un-hampered.

  determination from experimental data",,,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The aim of the paper is to propose another tool for phenomenological analyses
of experimental data from superallowed nuclear and neutron $\beta$ decays, and
from leptonic and semileptonic decays, that allows the finding of the most
probable numerical form of the CKM matrix, as well as the determination of
decay constants, $f_{P}$, and of various form factors $f_+(q^2)$, by using
another implementation of unitarity constraints. In particular this approach
allows the determination of semileptonic form factors that is illustrated on
the existing data from $D\rightarrow \pi l \nu$ and $D\rightarrow K l\nu$
decays.

of quantum field theory with maximal mass M, developed by V.G.Kadyshevsky et
al. within the pseudo-Hermitian quantum electrodynamics in the second order of
the perturbation theory. In theory, there is the natural cut-off of large
transmitted momentum in intermediate states because of presence of the
universal mass M. As a result, the electron self-mass is finite and depends on
the transmitted maximum momentum. Two interpretations of the obtained results
are possible at defined M and A. The first interpretation allows confirming
quantitatively the old concept of elementary particle mass sources defined by
interaction of particles with self-gauge fields. The second interpretation
results in the possibility not to renormalize the mass (at least in the second
order of perturbation theory) owing to the zero mass operator.
