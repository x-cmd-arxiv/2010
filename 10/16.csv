  environment","Videos Included",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This sequence of fluid dynamics videos illustrates the behavior of a
suspension of noncolloidal particles flowing past various bluff body obstacles
within a microfluidic device. The polystyrene particles, of 7 {\mu}m diameter
and volume fraction of 8.4%, are carefully made neutrally buoyant with the
suspending liquid composed of a mixture of water and a small fraction of
glycerol. The channel depth is 60 {\mu}m and the typical length of the
obstacles normal to the flow direction is 200 {\mu}m. The flow rate is varied
to generate Reynolds numbers based on the scale of the obstacle in the
approximate range 60 < Re < 500; the narrow dimension in the depth direction
suppresses onset of unsteadiness and vortex shedding, so that the flows studied
are found to be steady (aside from particle-scale fluctuations). Particles are
observed to be depleted in the wake region of the obstacle. In certain cases,
the entire wake is clear of particles; in other cases there is a portion of the
wake in which particles recirculate while a portion of the wake is completely
devoid of particles. Experimental observations reveal that if particles are
forced into an initially particle-depleted region, they will eventually leave
and will bring the wake to its original state, implying these are steady-state
distributions.

disentangling allows a time-series of composite spectra to be decomposed into

detailed abundance studies for 14 stars in eight eclipsing binary systems. Of

theoretical predictions of rotating single-star evolutionary models, both of
these stars show no abundance changes relative to unevolved main sequence stars
of the same mass. It is obvious that other effects are important in the

the homogeneous and alternating-kink states in zero magnetic field and the
homogeneous state in the magnetic field near the value corresponding to half
flux quantum per junction. We found two possible instabilities related to the
short-scale and long-scale perturbations. The homogeneous state in modulated
junction is typically unstable with respect to the short-scale alternating
phase deformations unless the Josephson current is completely suppressed in one

and homogeneous state in the magnetic field is only stable within a certain

deformations is controlled by resonance excitations of fast modes at finite

range near the resonance increases with decreasing the height.

terms of boundedness and decay assumptions on appropriate spacetime-norms of
the Ricci-coefficients and spacetime curvature. Given such assumptions at the
level of $k$ derivatives of the Ricci-coefficients (and hence $k-1$ derivatives
of curvature), we prove boundedness and decay estimates for $k$ derivatives of
\emph{curvature}. The proof employs the framework of vectorfield multipliers
and commutators for the Bel-Robinson tensor, pioneered by
Christodoulou-Klainerman in the context of the stability of the Minkowski

(which have been identified previously for the scalar wave equation on black

the redshift-effect near the horizon is obtained. Morever, we identify a
certain hierarchy in the Bianchi equations, which leads to the control of
strongly $r$-weighted spacetime curvature-norms near infinity. This allows to
avoid the use the classical conformal Morawetz multiplier $K$, therby
generalizing recent work of Dafermos and Rodnianski in the context of the wave
equation. Finally, the proof requires a detailed understanding of the structure
of the error-terms in the interior. This is particularly intricate in view of
both the phenomenon of trapped orbits and the fact that, unlike in the
stability of Minkowski space, not all curvature components decay to zero.

these forces depend non-trivially on geometry, and existing formulae and
approximations cannot deal with realistic micro-machinery components with sharp
edges and tips. Here, we employ a novel approach to electromagnetic scattering,
appropriate to perfect conductors with sharp edges and tips, specifically to
wedges and cones. The interaction of these objects with a metal plate (and
among themselves) is then computed systematically by a multiple-scattering
series. For the wedge, we obtain analytical expressions for the interaction
with a plate, as functions of opening angle and tilt, which should provide a
particularly useful tool for the design of MEMs. Our result for the Casimir
interactions between conducting cones and plates applies directly to the force
on the tip of a scanning tunneling probe; the unexpectedly large temperature
dependence of the force in these configurations should attract immediate
experimental interest.

understand the processes occurring inside a living cell. In his physical theory
of the cell, American physiologist Gilbert Ling introduced an important notion
of the resting state of the cell. He describes this state as an independent
stable thermodynamic state of a living substance in which it has stored all the
energy it needs to perform all kinds of biological work. This state is
characterised by lower entropy of the system than in an active state. However,
Ling's approach is primarily qualitative in terms of thermodynamics and it
needs to be characterised more specifically. To this end, we propose a new
thermodynamic approach to studying Ling's model of the living cell (Ling's
cell), the center piece of which is the non-ergodicity property which has
recently been proved for a wide range of systems in statistical mechanics [7].
These approach allowed us to develop general thermodynamic approaches to
explaining some of the well-known physiological phenomena, which can be used
for further physical analysis of these phenomena using specific physical
models.

stable state is vapour. For moderately large evaporation rates (moderately
large initial to ambient pressure ratios), the initially flat vapour-liquid

downwards into the liquid with a well defined mean velocity. This mean velocity
turns out to be a function of the ratio between the initial and the ambient

knots and links of 8 or fewer crossings. The standard symmetry group for a link
is the mapping class group $\MCG(S^3,L)$ or $\Sym(L)$ of the pair $(S^3,L)$.
Elements in this symmetry group can (and often do) fix the link and act
nontrivially only on its complement. We ignore such elements and focus on the
""intrinsic"" symmetry group of a link, defined to be the image $\Sigma(L)$ of
the natural homomorphism $\MCG(S^3,L) \rightarrow \MCG(S^3) \cross \MCG(L)$.
This different symmetry group, first defined by Whitten in 1969, records
directly whether $L$ is isotopic to a link $L'$ obtained from $L$ by permuting
components or reversing orientations.
  For hyperbolic links both $\Sym(L)$ and $\Sigma(L)$ can be obtained using the
output of \texttt{SnapPea}, but this proof does not give any hints about how to
actually construct isotopies realizing $\Sigma(L)$. We show that standard
invariants are enough to rule out all the isotopies outside $\Sigma(L)$ for all
links except $7^2_6$, $8^2_{13}$ and $8^3_5$ where an additional construction
is needed to use the Jones polynomial to rule out ""component exchange""
symmetries. On the other hand, we present explicit isotopies starting with the
positions in Cerf's table of oriented links which generate $\Sigma(L)$ for each

neutron densities that are free from most strong interaction uncertainties. In
this paper we present statistical error estimates for a variety of experiments.
The neutron radius $R_n$ can be measured in several nuclei, as long as the
nuclear excited states are not too low in energy. We present error estimates
for $R_n$ measurements in $^{40}$Ca, $^{48}$Ca, $^{112}$Sn, $^{120}$Sn,
$^{124}$Sn, and $^{208}$Pb. In general, we find that the smaller the nucleus,
the easier the measurement. This is because smaller nuclei can be measured at
higher momentum transfers where the parity violating asymmetry $A_{pv}$ is
larger. Also in general, the more neutron rich the isotope, the easier the
measurement, because neutron rich isotopes have larger weak charges and larger
$A_{pv}$. Measuring $R_n$ in $^{48}$Ca appears very promising because it has a
higher figure of merit than $^{208}$Pb. In addition, $R_n(^{48}$Ca) may be more
easily related to two nucleon and three nucleon interactions, including very
interesting three neutron forces, than $R_n(^{208}$Pb). After measuring $R_n$,
one can constrain the surface thickness of the neutron density $a_n$ with a
second measurement at somewhat higher momentum transfers. We present
statistical error estimates for measuring $a_n$ in $^{48}$Ca, $^{120}$Sn, and
$^{208}$Pb. Again, we find that $a_n$ is easier to measure in smaller nuclei.

  videos included",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Shock wave surfing is investigated experimentally in GALCIT's Mach 4.0
Ludwieg Tube. Shock wave surfing occurs when a secondary free-body follows the
bow shock formed by a primary free-body; an example of shock wave surfing
occurs during meteorite breakup. The free-bodies in the current investigation
are nylon spheres. During each run in the Ludwieg tube a high speed camera is
used to capture a series of schlieren images; edge tracking software is used to
measure the position of each sphere. Velocity and acceleration are had from
processing the position data. The radius ratio and initial orientation of the
two spheres are varied in the test matrix. The variation of sphere radius ratio
and initial angle between the centers of gravity are shown to have a
significant effect on the dynamics of the system.
  The air flow in each fluid dynamics video is from left to right. The Mach
number is 4.0 with total pressure in each run of roughly 200kPa. Each run
begins with the spheres tethered and no flow. Flow arrives and the tethers are
quickly broken. The spheres are then free-bodies with the dominant force being
the pressure distribution around the surface of the sphere, which, in the case
of the secondary sphere, is strongly manipulated by the shock wave interaction.
Gravity is not a considerable body force because of the short test times in
these experiments. The secondary spheres are visibly seen to be affected by the
bow shock wave of the primary bodies in the form of quite beautiful
trajectories. Computational images were obtained from a simulation using the
AMROC code. A fully three-dimensional simulation of two free-flying bodies was
performed, assuming inviscid flow, whereby the trajectory of each sphere was
calculated according to the instantaneous aerodynamic forces experienced.

cosmic rays are primarily accelerated by supernova remnants. If also true for
low-energy cosmic rays, the ionization rate near a supernova remnant should be
higher than in the general Galactic interstellar medium (ISM). We have searched
for H3+ absorption features in 6 sight lines which pass through molecular
material near IC 443---a well-studied case of a supernova remnant interacting
with its surrounding molecular material---for the purpose of inferring the
cosmic-ray ionization rate in the region. In 2 of the sight lines (toward ALS
8828 and HD 254577) we find large H3+ column densities, N(H3+)~3*10^14 cm^-2,
and deduce ionization rates of zeta_2~2*10^-15 s^-1, about 5 times larger than
inferred toward average diffuse molecular cloud sight lines. However, the 3
sigma upper limits found for the other 4 sight lines are consistent with
typical Galactic values. This wide range of ionization rates is likely the
result of particle acceleration and propagation effects, which predict that the
cosmic-ray spectrum and thus ionization rate should vary in and around the
remnant. While we cannot determine if the H3+ absorption arises in post-shock
(interior) or pre-shock (exterior) gas, the large inferred ionization rates
suggest that IC 443 is in fact accelerating a large population of low-energy
cosmic rays. Still, it is unclear whether this population can propagate far
enough into the ISM to account for the ionization rate inferred in diffuse
Galactic sight lines.

0.3-8.0 keV X-ray observations and spectroscopic-like temperature maps. We have
searched these maps with a new automated algorithm to identify the presence of
cold fronts in projection. Using a threshold of a minimum of 10 cold front
pixels in our images, corresponding to a total comoving length L_cf > 156h^-1
kpc, we find that roughly 10-12% of all projections in a mass-limited sample
would be classified as cold front clusters. Interestingly, the fraction of
clusters with extended cold front features in our synthetic maps of a
mass-limited sample trends only weakly with redshift out to z=1.0. However,
when using different selection functions, including a simulated flux limit, the
trending with redshift changes significantly. The likelihood of finding cold
fronts in the simulated clusters in our sample is a strong function of cluster
mass. In clusters with M>7.5x10^14 M_sun the cold front fraction is 40-50%. We
also show that the presence of cold fronts is strongly correlated with
disturbed morphology as measured by quantitative structure measures. Finally,
we find that the incidence of cold fronts in the simulated cluster images is
strongly dependent on baryonic physics.

and optically thick to He I 10830 and H alpha, but optically thin to He I 5876,
Pa gamma, and the Ca II infrared triplet. The optically thick He I 5876
emission occurs mostly in regions of density greater than or equal to 10^11
cm^-3 and temperature greater than or equal to 1.5x10^4 K, while the optically
thick H alpha and Pa gamma emission occur mostly in regions of density around
10^11 cm^-3 and temperature between 8750 and 1.25x10^4 K. In producing the
observed line fluxes at a given v_obs, the covering factor of these emission
clumps is sufficiently small not to incur significant absorption of the stellar
and veiling continua in either He I or H lines. The strong Ca II broad line
emission likely arises in both the magnetospheric accretion flow and the disk
boundary layer, where the gases dissipate part of their rotational energies
before infalling along magnetic field lines. The needed density and temperature
are ~10^12 cm^-3 and less than or equal to 7500 K.

analyze genome-wide histone acetylation patterns and gene expression profiles
measured over the first five days of cell differentiation triggered by
silencing Nanog, a key transcription factor in ESC regulation. We explore the
temporal and spatial dynamics of histone acetylation data and its correlation
with gene expression using supervised and unsupervised statistical models. On a
genome-wide scale, changes in acetylation are significantly correlated to
changes in mRNA expression and, surprisingly, this coherence increases over
time. We quantify the predictive power of histone acetylation for gene
expression changes in a balanced cross-validation procedure. In an in-depth
study we focus on genes central to the regulatory network of Mouse ESC,
including those identified in a recent genome-wide RNAi screen and in the
PluriNet, a computationally derived stem cell signature. We find that compared
to the rest of the genome, ESC-specific genes show significantly more
acetylation signal and a much stronger decrease in acetylation over time, which
is often not reflected in an concordant expression change. These results shed
light on the complexity of the relationship between histone acetylation and
gene expression and are a step forward to dissect the multilayer regulatory
mechanisms that determine stem cell fate.

However, these imaging tools cannot readily be used to observe processes

thickness and sample evaporation in the high vacuum microscope chamber. To
address these challenges, we have developed a nano-Hele-Shaw cell, dubbed the

The second solution contains 5 nm gold particles in water. The imaging was

prominently decorate the clusters and are clearly distinguished. In the footage

Individual particles and small clusters are seen diffusing throughout the field

structure. The rate of aggregation and the fractal dimension of the aggregates
are consistent with light scattering measurements, indicating that the electron

many inconsistencies, fallacies and misconceptions. One of such misconceptions
is related to arithmetic of natural numbers, which is extremely important both
for science and everyday life. People think their counting is governed by the
rules of the conventional arithmetic and thus other kinds of arithmetics of
natural numbers do not exist and cannot exist. However, this popular image of
the situation with the natural numbers is wrong. In many situations, people
have to utilize and do implicitly utilize rules of counting and operating
different from rules and operations in the conventional arithmetic. This is a
consequence of the existing diversity in nature and society. To correctly
represent this diversity, people have to explicitly employ different
arithmetics. To make a distinction, we call the conventional arithmetic by the
name Diophantine arithmetic, while other arithmetics are called
non-Diophantine. There are two big families of non-Diophantine arithmetics:
projective arithmetics and dual arithmetics (Burgin, 1997). In this work, we
give an exposition of projective arithmetics, presenting their properties and
considering also a more general mathematical structure called a projective
prearithmetic. The Diophantine arithmetic is a member of this parametric
family: its parameter is equal to the identity function f(x) = x. In
conclusion, it is demonstrated how non-Diophantine arithmetics may be utilized
beyond mathematics and how they allow one to eliminate inconsistencies and

generally covariant way arXiv:hep-th/0210184. Using this formalism, it has been
found recently that there exists a class of massive nonlinear theories that are
free of the Boulware-Deser ghosts, at least in the decoupling limit
arXiv:1007.0443. In this work we study other recently proposed models that go
under the name of ""gravitational Higgs theories"" arXiv:1002.3877,
arXiv:1008.5132. We show that these models, although seemingly different from
the effective field theories of massive gravity, are in fact equivalent to
them. Furthermore, based on the results obtained in the effective field theory
approach, we conclude that the gravitational Higgs theories need the same
adjustment of the Lagrangian to avoid the ghosts. We also show the equivalence
between the noncovariant mode decomposition used in the Higgs theories, and the
covariant St\""uckelbergization adopted in the effective field theories, thus,
proving that the presence or absence of the ghost is independent of the
parametrization used in either theory.

cores. Many companions are ejected into unbound orbits and quickly escape, but
others are ejected with insufficient momentum to climb out of the potential
well of the cloud core and associated binary. These loosely bound companions
reach distances of many thousands of AU before falling back and eventually
being ejected into escapes as the cloud cores gradually disappear. We use the
term orphans to denote protostellar objects that are dynamically ejected from
their placental cloud cores, either escaping or for a time being tenuously
bound at large separations. Half of all triple systems are found to
disintegrate during the protostellar stage, so if multiple systems are a
frequent outcome of the collapse of a cloud core, then orphans should be
common. Bound orphans are associated with embedded close protostellar binaries,
but escaping orphans can travel as far as ~0.2 pc during the protostellar
phase. The steep climb out of a potential well ensures that orphans are not
kinematically distinct from young stars born with a less violent pre-history.
The identification of orphans outside their heavily extincted cloud cores will
allow the detailed study of protostars high up on their Hayashi tracks at
near-infrared and in some cases even at optical wavelengths.

state are studied within the framework of QCD factorization (QCDF). Due to the
G-parity of the tensor meson, both the chiral-even and chiral-odd two-parton
light-cone distribution amplitudes of the tensor meson are antisymmetric under
the interchange of momentum fractions of the quark and anti-quark in the SU(3)
limit. Our main results are: (i) In the naive factorization approach, the
decays such as $B^-\to \bar K_2^{*0}\pi^-$ and $\bar B^0\to K_2^{*-}\pi^+$ with
a tensor meson emitted are prohibited owing to the fact that a tensor meson
cannot be created from the local V-A or tensor current. Nevertheless, they
receive nonfactorizable contributions in QCDF from vertex, penguin and hard
spectator corrections. The experimental observation of $B^-\to \bar
K_2^{*0}\pi^-$ indicates the importance of nonfactorizable effects. (ii) For
penguin-dominated $B\to TP$ and $TV$ decays, the predicted rates in naive
factorization are usually too small by one to two orders of magnitude. In QCDF,
they are enhanced by power corrections from penguin annihilation and
nonfactorizable contributions.(iii) The dominant penguin contributions to $B\to
K_2^*\eta^{(')}$ arise from the processes: (a) $b\to ss\bar s\to s\eta_s$ and
(b) $b\to s q\bar q\to q \bar K_2^*$ with $\eta_q=(u\bar u+d\bar d)/\sqrt{2}$

measure the photometry of the hosts in Spitzer Space Telescope and ground-based

induces a phenomenon known as `electrohydraulic discharge'. The electric field
causes the water to break down, generating either a corona (at lower field
strengths) or a pulsed arc (at higher field strengths). The discharge typically
results in a complex combination of physical processes (e.g., cavitation and
light emission) and chemical reactions (e.g., generation of free radicals and
nonthermal plasmas). The combination of physical and chemical processes tends
to destroy any organic molecules present, and accordingly electrohydraulic
discharges are currently being investigated as a potentially inexpensive and
environmentally friendly means for purifying drinking water and removing
contaminants from wastewater.
  Two types of electrode configurations have been the main focus of research to
date: (i) a `one-phase' system with both electrodes immersed in water, or (ii)
a `two-phase' system with one electrode in air and the other submerged in
water. In this fluid dynamics video, we demonstrate the striking consequences
of triggering an electrohydraulic discharge in a two-phase system comprised of
water and a viscous, insulating oil. An air/water interface typically remains
stationary until the discharge occurs; in contrast, the oil/water interface
deforms into a conical shape (i.e., a Taylor cone) stretching from the water
phase toward the oil-immersed electrode. The behavior after the cone contacts
the electrode depends sensitively on the properties of the water and oil, and
we demonstrate that, under appropriate conditions, destructive explosions
occur.

Hence, the barrier modification effects in $\ell$-summed Wong expression
depends on the choice of Skyrme force in extended ETF method.

as an instantaneous mixture of contributions (waves, emissions, ...) of

becomes one of the key objectives. However, unless the underlying mixing
processes are well known, these situations lead to heavily underdetermined
problems. Blind source separation aims at disentangling such mixtures with the
least possible prior information on the sources and their mixing processes.
Several powerful approaches have recently been developed, which can often
provide new or deeper insight into the underlying physics. This tutorial paper
briefly discusses some possible applications of blind source separation to the
field of plasma physics, in which this concept is still barely known. Two
examples are given. The first one shows how concurrent processes in the
dynamical response of the electron temperature in a tokamak can be separated.
The second example deals with solar spectral imaging in the Extreme UV and
shows how empirical temperature maps can be built.

of initially 'infected' vertices spreads by infecting (at each time step)
vertices with at least r already-infected neighbours. This process may be
viewed as a monotone version of the Glauber dynamics of the Ising model, and
has been extensively studied on the d-dimensional grid $[n]^d$. The elements of
the set A are usually chosen independently, with some density p, and the main
question is to determine $p_c([n]^d,r)$, the density at which percolation
(infection of the entire vertex set) becomes likely.
  In this paper we prove, for every pair $d \ge r \ge 2$, that there is a
constant L(d,r) such that $p_c([n]^d,r) = [(L(d,r) + o(1)) / log_(r-1)

invariant under this group (left and right acting). The concept of relative

understanding of this class of stars. With high-technology techniques

spectropolarimetry, high-resolution photometry, etc) from different instruments
and space mission such as the VLTI, CHARA, FLAMES, ESPADONS-NARVAL, COROT,

modelling of the Be stars stellar evolution but also their circumstellar
decretion disks. In particular, the confrontation between theory and
observations about the effects of the stellar formation and evolution on the
main sequence, the metallicity, the magnetic fields, the stellar pulsations,
the rotational velocity, and the binarity (including the X-rays binaries) on
the Be phenomenon appearance is discussed. The disks observations and the
efforts made on their modelling is mentioned. As the life of a star does not

the existence of $\Lambda$ (in particular $\Omega_{\Lambda}$) which could be

spp.) is capitalized upon to explore the fluids dynamics of feeding uncoupled
from swimming. A mathematical model is developed to capture the fundamental
characteristics of the motion of the unique concave bell shape. Given the
prominence of the oral arms, this structure is included and modeled as a porous
layer that perturbs the flow generated by bell contractions. The immersed
boundary method is used to solve the fluid-structure interaction problem.
Velocity fields obtained from live organisms using digital particle image
velocimetry were used to validate the numerical simulations. Parameter sweeps
were used to numerically explore the effects of changes in pulse dynamics and
the properties of the oral arms independently. Numerical experiments allow the
opportunity to examine physical effects and limits within and beyond the
biologically relevant range to develop a better understanding of the system.
The presence of the prominent oral arm structure in the field of flow increased
the flux of new fluid from along the substrate to the bell. The numerical
simulations also showed that the presence of pauses between bell expansion and
the next contraction alters the flow of the fluid over the bell and through the
oral arms.

propulsion or paddling, will not work in Stokes flow (Reynolds number = 0). In
nature the effective limit of jet propulsion is still in the range where
inertial forces are significant. It appears that almost all animals that use
jet propulsion swim at Reynolds numbers (Re) of about 5 or more. Juvenile squid
and octopods hatch from the egg already swimming in this inertial regime. The
limitations of jet propulsion at intermediate Re is explored here using the
immersed boundary method to solve the two-dimensional Navier Stokes equations
coupled to the motion of a simplified jellyfish. The contraction and expansion
kinematics are prescribed, but the forward and backward swimming motions of the
idealized jellyfish are emergent properties determined by the resulting fluid
dynamics. Simulations are performed for both an oblate bell shape using a
paddling mode of swimming and a prolate bell shape using jet propulsion.
Average forward velocities and work put into the system are calculated for
Reynolds numbers between 1 and 320. The results show that forward velocities
rapidly decay with decreasing Re for all bell shapes when Re < 10. Similarly,
the work required to generate the pulsing motion increases significantly for Re
< 10. When compared actual organisms, the swimming velocities and vortex
separation patterns for the model prolate agree with those observed in Nemopsis
bachei. The forward swimming velocities of the model oblate jellyfish after two
pulse cycles are comparable to those reported for Aurelia aurita, but
discrepancies are observed in the vortex dynamics between when the 2D model
oblate jellyfish and the organism.

$H=T+U={p^2}/{2(1+\lambda q^2)}+{{\omega}^2 q^2}/{2(1+\lambda q^2)}$, where U
is known to be the ""intrinsic"" oscillator potential on the Darboux spaces of
nonconstant curvature determined by the kinetic energy term T and parametrized
by {\lambda}. We show that H is Stackel equivalent to the free Euclidean
motion, a fact that directly provides a curved Fradkin tensor of constants of
motion for H. Furthermore, we analyze in terms of {\lambda} the three different
underlying manifolds whose geodesic motion is provided by T. As a consequence,
we find that H comprises three different nonlinear physical models that, by
constructing their radial effective potentials, are shown to be two different
nonlinear oscillators and an infinite barrier potential. The quantization of
these two oscillators and its connection with spherical confinement models is
briefly discussed.

critical behaviour of mass deformed N=4 SU(N) supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory
at strong coupling, also known as N=2* gauge theory. For certain range of the
mass parameters, N=2* plasma undergoes a second-order phase transition. We
compute all the static critical exponents of the model and demonstrate that the
transition is of the mean-field theory type. We show that the dynamical
critical exponent of the model is z=0, with multiple hydrodynamic relaxation
rates at criticality. We point out that the dynamical critical phenomena in
N=2* plasma is outside the dynamical universality classes established by
Hohenberg and Halperin.

interspecies interaction. Here, we include intraspecific competition to the
Lotka-Volterra model and solve it analytically. Despite being simple and
thoroughly studied, this model presents a very rich behavior and some
characteristics not so well explored, which are unveiled. The forbidden region
in the mutualism regime and the dependence on initial conditions in the
competition regime are some examples of these characteristics. From the
stability of the steady state solutions, three phases are obtained: (i)
extinction of one species (Gause transition), (ii) their coexistence and (iii)
a forbidden region. Full analytical solutions have been obtained for the
considered ecological regimes. The time transient allows one to defined time
scales for the system evolution, which can be relevant for the study of tumor
growth by theoretical or computer simulation models.

results in the conventional quantum mechanical formalism at a larger atomic
scale and Newton's gravitational law at a macroscopic scale.

and non-coding (introns) regions of a DNA sequence is one of the central
problems of genomics. The introns are estimated to be nearly 95% of the DNA and
since they do not seem to participate in the process of transcription of
amino-acids, they have been termed ""junk DNA."" Although it is believed that the
non-coding regions in genomes have no role in cell growth and evolution,
demonstration that these regions carry useful information would tend to falsify
this belief. In this paper, we consider entropy as a measure of information by
modifying the entropy expression to take into account the varying length of
these sequences. Exons are usually much shorter in length than introns;
therefore the comparison of the entropy values needs to be normalized. A length
correction strategy was employed using randomly generated nucleonic base
strings built out of the alphabet of the same size as the exons under question.
Our analysis shows that introns carry nearly as much of information as exons,
disproving the notion that they do not carry any information. The entropy
findings of this paper are likely to be of use in further study of other
challenging works like the analysis of symmetry models of the genetic code.

  2010",,,,"physics.flu-dyn physics.bio-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Long distance wind dispersal requires small spores with low terminal
velocities, which can be held aloft by turbulent air currents until they are
deposited in suitable habitats for colonization. The inherent difficulty in
dispersing spores by wind is that spores easily carried by wind are also
rapidly decelerated when moving through still air. Thus the height of spore
release is critical in determining their range of dispersal. Vascular plants
with wind dispersed spores use the height of the plant to lift spores into
sufficient wind currents for dispersal, however non-vascular plants such as
Sphagnum cannot grow sufficiently tall. These fluid dynamics videos show how
exploding capsules of {\em Sphagnum} moss generate vortex rings to carry spores
to heights above 10 cm with an initial velocity of 16 m s$^{-1}$. In contrast
spores launched ballistically at these speeds through still air would travel
only 2-7 mm.
