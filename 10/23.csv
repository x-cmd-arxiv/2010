by means of 3D magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) numerical simulations. For the first
time, an observationally derived surface magnetic field map is implemented in
MHD models of stellar winds for a low mass star. We show that the wind of
V374Peg deviates greatly from a low-velocity, low-mass-loss rate solar-type
wind. We find general scaling relations for the terminal velocities, mass-loss
rates, and spin-down times of highly magnetized M dwarfs. In particular, for
V374Peg, our models show that terminal velocities across a range of stellar
latitudes reach ~(1500-2300) n_{12}^{-1/2} km/s, where n_{12} is the coronal
wind base density in units of 10^{12} cm^{-3}, while the mass-loss rates are
about 4 x 10^{-10} n_{12}^{1/2} Msun/yr. We also evaluate the angular-momentum
loss of V374Peg, which presents a rotational braking timescale ~28
n_{12}^{-1/2} Myr. Compared to observationally derived values from period
distributions of stars in open clusters, this suggests that V374Peg may have
low coronal base densities (< 10^{11} cm^{-3}). We show that the wind ram
pressure of V374Peg is about 5 orders of magnitude larger than for the solar
wind. Nevertheless, a small planetary magnetic field intensity (~ 0.1G) is able
to shield a planet orbiting at 1 AU against the erosive effects of the stellar
wind. However, planets orbiting inside the habitable zone of V374Peg, where the
wind ram pressure is higher, might be facing a more significant atmospheric
erosion. In that case, higher planetary magnetic fields of, at least, about
half the magnetic field intensity of Jupiter, are required to protect the
planet's atmosphere.

extragalactic observations. Separating this emission from that associated with
extragalactic objects is both important and difficult. In this paper we discuss
a particular case, the M81 group, and the identification of diffuse structures
prominent in the infrared, but also detected at optical wavelengths. The origin
of these structures has previously been controversial, ranging from them being
the result of a past interaction between M81 and M82 or due to more local
Galactic emission. We show that over of order a few arcminute scales the
far-infrared (Herschel 250 &\mu&m) emission correlates spatially very well with
a particular narrow velocity (2-3 km/s) component of the Galactic HI. We find
no evidence that any of the far-infrared emission associated with these
features actually originates in the M81 group. Thus we infer that the
associated diffuse optical emission must be due to galactic light back
scattered off dust in our galaxy. Ultra-violet observations pick out young
stellar associations around M81, but no detectable far-infrared emission. We
consider in detail one of the Galactic cirrus features, finding that the
far-infrared HI relation breaks down below arc minute scales and that at

specialist plants are pollinated by generalist animals, while generalist plants
are pollinated by a broad involving specialists and generalists. It has been
suggested that this asymmetric ---or disassortative--- assemblage could play an
important role in determining the equal susceptibility of specialist and
generalist plants under habitat destruction. At the core of the argument lies
the observation that specialist plants, otherwise candidates to extinction,
could cope with the disruption thanks to their interaction with generalist
pollinators. We present a theoretical framework that supports this thesis. We
analyze a dynamical model of a system of mutualistic plants and pollinators,
subject to the destruction of their habitat. We analyze and compare two
families of interaction topologies, ranging from highly assortative to highly
disassortative ones, as well as real pollination networks. We found that
several features observed in natural systems are predicted by the mathematical
model. First, there is a tendency to increase the asymmetry of the network as a
result of the extinctions. Second, an entropy measure of the differential
susceptibility to extinction of specialist and generalist species show that
they tend to balance when the network is disassortative. Finally, the
disappearance of links in the network, as a result of extinctions, shows that
specialist plants preserve more connections than the corresponding plants in an
assortative system, enabling them to resist the disruption.

We define operator spin foams, that is foams labelled by group representations
and operators, as the main tool. An equivalence relation we impose in the set
of the operator spin foams allows to split the faces and the edges of the
foams. The consistency with that relation requires introduction of the
(familiar for the BF theory) face amplitude. The operator spin foam models are
defined quite generally. Imposing a maximal symmetry leads to a family we call
natural operator spin foam models. This symmetry, combined with demanding
consistency with splitting the edges, determines a complete characterization of
a general natural model. It can be obtained by applying arbitrary (quantum)
constraints on an arbitrary BF spin foam model. In particular, imposing
suitable constraints on Spin(4) BF spin foam model is exactly the way we tend
to view 4d quantum gravity, starting with the BC model and continuing with the
EPRL or FK models. That makes our framework directly applicable to those
models. Specifically, our operator spin foam framework can be translated into
the language of spin foams and partition functions. We discuss the examples: BF
spin foam model, the BC model, and the model obtained by application of our
framework to the EPRL intertwiners.

dynamical processes of polymer chain initiation, extension, and merger. The
ratio $G=D/F$ is found to have a strong influence on the polymer film
morphology. Spatial and temporal behavior of kinetic roughening has been
extensively studied using finite-length scaling and height-height correlations
$H(r,t)$. The scaling analysis has been performed within the no-overhang
approximation and the scaling behaviors at local and global length scales were
found to be very different. The global and local scaling exponents for
morphological evolution have been evaluated for varying free-monomer diffusion
by growing the films at $G$ = $10$, $10^2$, $10^3$, and $10^4$ and fixing the
deposition flux $F$. With an increase in $G$ from $10$ to $10^4$, the average
growth exponent $\beta \approx 0.50$ was found to be invariant, where as the
global roughness exponent $\alpha_{g}$ decreased from $0.87(1)$ to $0.73(1)$
along with a corresponding decrease in the global dynamic exponent $z_g$ from
$1.71(1)$ to $1.38(2)$. The global scaling exponents were observed to follow
the dynamic scaling hypothesis, $z_g=\alpha_{g}/\beta$. With a similar increase

vortex dynamics in metallic nanopillars with in-plane magnetized layers. We
study nanopillars with a diameter of 150 nm, containing two Fe layers with a
thickness of 15 nm and 30 nm respectively, separated by a 6 nm Ag spacer. The
sample geometry is such that it allows for the formation of magnetic vortices
in the Fe disks. As confirmed by micromagnetic simulations, we are able to
prepare states where one magnetic layer is homogeneously magnetized while the
other contains a vortex. We experimentally show that in this configuration
spin-transfer torque can excite vortex dynamics and analyze their dependence on
a magnetic field applied in the sample plane. The center of gyration is
continuously dislocated from the disk center, and the potential changes its
shape with field strength. The latter is reflected in the field dependence of
the excitation frequency. In the second part we propose a novel mechanism for
the excitation of the gyrotropic mode in nanopillars with a perfectly
homogeneously magnetized in-plane polarizing layer. We analytically show that
in this configuration the vortex can absorb energy from the spin-polarized
electric current if the angular spin-transfer efficiency function is
asymmetric. This effect is supported by micromagnetic simulations.

the correlation between field strength and brightness. The data show that
magnetic flux density contains a significant amount of intrinsically weak
fields that contribute little to brightness. We show that with data of high
spatial resolution a calibration of magnetic flux density as a proxy for
brightness excess is possible. In the SST data, the magnetic brightening of a
quiet region with an average (unsigned) flux density of 10 G is about 0.15%. In
the Hinode data, and in SST data reduced to Hinode resolution, the measured
brightening is some 40% lower. With appropriate correction for resolution,
magnetic flux density can be used as a reliable proxy in regions of small scale
mixed polarity. The measured brightness effect is larger than the variation of
irradiance over a solar cycle. It is not clear, however, if this quiet Sun

Particular attention is placed on quantifying the strength and non-stationarity
of timing noise in millisecond pulsars because the long-term stability of these
objects is required to detect nanohertz gravitational radiation. We show that a
single scaling law is sufficient to characterize timing noise in millisecond
and canonical pulsars while the same scaling law underestimates the levels of
timing noise in magnetars. The scaling law, along with a detailed study of the
millisecond pulsar B1937+21, leads us to conclude that timing noise is latent
in most millisecond pulsars and will be measurable in many objects when better
arrival time estimates are obtained over long data spans. The sensitivity of a
pulsar timing array to gravitational radiation is strongly affected by any
timing noise. We conclude that detection of proposed gravitational wave
backgrounds will require the analysis of more objects than previously suggested
over data spans that depend on the spectra of both the gravitational wave
background and of the timing noise. It is imperative to find additional
millisecond pulsars in current and future surveys in order to reduce the
effects of timing noise.

evolving galaxies at the highest redshifts. However, in order to use Lya as a
physical probe of galaxies, it becomes vital to know the Lya escape fraction
(fescLya). Unfortunately, due to the resonant nature of Lya, fescLya may vary
unpredictably and requires empirical measurement. Here we compile Lya
luminosity functions between redshift z=0 and 8 and, combined with H-alpha and
ultraviolet data, assess how fescLya evolves with redshift. We find a strong
upwards evolution in fescLya over the range z=0.3-6, which is well-fit by the
power-law fescLya \propto (1+z)^\xi, with \xi =(2.57_-0.12^+0.19). This
predicts that fescLya should reach unity at z=11.1. By comparing fescLya and
E(B-V) in individual galaxies we derive an empirical relationship between
fescLya and E(B-V), which includes resonance scattering and can explain the
redshift evolution of fescLya between z=0 and 6 purely as a function of the
evolution in the dust content of galaxies. Beyond z~6.5, fescLya drops more
substantially; an effect attributed to either ionizing photon leakage, or an
increase in the neutral gas fraction of the intergalactic medium. While
distinguishing between those two scenarios may be extremely challenging, by
framing the problem this way we remove the uncertainty of the halo mass from
Lya-based tests of reionization. We finally derive a new method by which to
estimate the dust content of galaxies based purely upon the observed Lya and UV
LFs. These data are characterized by an exponential with an e-folding redshift
of ~3.5.

accreted at early times and survive to the present have orbital properties that
are discrepant with those observed for the LMC. The high velocity of the LMC,
coupled with the dearth of unbound orbits seen in the simulation, argues that
the mass of the MW's halo is unlikely to be less than 2 x 10^12 Msun. This
conclusion is further supported by statistics of halos hosting satellites with
masses, velocities, and separations comparable to those of the LMC. We further
show that: (1) LMC and SMC-mass objects are not particularly uncommon in
MW-mass halos; (2) the apparently high angular momentum of the LMC is not
cosmologically unusual; and (3) it is rare for a MW halo to host a LMC-SMC
binary system at z=0, but high speed binary pairs accreted at late times are
possible. Based on these results, we conclude that the LMC was accreted within
the past four Gyr and is currently making its first pericentric passage about
the MW.

upper end of the conformal window. If the change in sign is interpreted as

higher number of critical flavors. These are universal properties, i.e. they

We carry out a differential comparison of the (g-z) vs. (g-K) two-colour
diagrams for GC systems in the different galaxies in order to see whether there
are indications of age differences. We also compare the different GC systems
with a few simple stellar population models. Results: No significant difference
is detected in the mean ages of GCs among elliptical galaxies. S0 galaxies on
the other hand, show evidence for younger GCs. Surprisingly, this appears to be
driven by the more metal-poor clusters. The age distribution of GCs in NGC4365
seems to be similar to that of other large ellipticals (e.g. NGC4486, NGC4649).
Padova SSPs with recently released isochrones for old ages (14 Gyrs) show less
of an offset with respect to the photometry than previously published models.
Conclusions: We suggest that E type galaxies assembled most of their GCs in a
shorter and earlier period than S0 type galaxies. The latter galaxy type, seems
to have a more extended period of GC formation/assembly.

a rapidly spinning 15.65 Msun black hole orbiting an underluminous 70 Msun Main
Sequence companion in a slightly eccentric 3.45 day orbit. Although
post-main-sequence mass transfer explains the masses and tight orbit, it leaves
unexplained the observed X-Ray luminosity, star's underluminosity, black hole's
spin, and eccentricity. A common envelope phase, or rotational mixing, could
explain the orbit, but the former would lead to a merger and the latter to an
overluminous companion. A merger would also ensue if mass transfer to the black
hole were invoked for its spin-up. Here we report that, if M33 X-7 started as a
primary of 85-99 Msun and a secondary of 28-32 Msun, in a 2.8-3.1 day orbit,
its observed properties can be consistently explained. In this model, the Main
Sequence primary transferred part of its envelope to the secondary and lost the
rest in a wind; it ended its life as a ~16 Msun He star with a Fe-Ni core which
collapsed to a black hole (with or without an accompanying supernova). The
release of binding energy and, possibly, collapse asymmetries ""kicked"" the
nascent black hole into an eccentric orbit. Wind accretion explains the X-Ray
luminosity, while the black hole spin can be natal.

well as the information shared, between the macroscopic and local levels as
functions of the strength of a coupling parameter in the system. Our results
show that the emergence of nontrivial collective behavior is associated to
higher values of complexity. Little transference of information from the global
to the local level occurs when the system settles into nontrivial collective
behavior while no information at all flows between these two scales in a
synchronized collective state. As the parameter values for the onset of
nontrivial collective behavior or chaos synchronization are approached, the
information transfer from the macroscopic level to the local level is higher,
in comparison to the situation where those collective states are already
established in the system. Our results add support to the view of complexity as
an emergent collective property that is absent at the local level in systems of

determined by the worst congestion of any resource. These games directly relate
to network routing problems and also job-shop scheduling problems. In typical
bottleneck congestion games, the utility costs of the players are determined by
the worst congested resources that they use. However, the resulting Nash
equilibria are inefficient, since the price of anarchy is proportional on the
number of resources which can be high. Here we show that we can get smaller
price of anarchy with the bottleneck social cost metric. We introduce the {\em
polynomial bottleneck games} where the utility costs of the players are
polynomial functions of the congestion of the resources that they use. In
particular, the delay function for any resource $r$ is $C_{r}^\M$, where $C_r$
is the congestion measured as the number of players that use $r$, and $\M \geq
1$ is an integer constant that defines the degree of the polynomial. The
utility cost of a player is the sum of the individual delays of the resources
that it uses. The social cost of the game remains the same, namely, it is the
worst bottleneck resource congestion: $\max_{r} C_r$. We show that polynomial
bottleneck games are very efficient and give price of anarchy
$O(|R|^{1/(\M+1)})$, where $R$ is the set of resources. This price of anarchy
is tight, since we demonstrate a game with price of anarchy
$\Omega(|R|^{1/(\M+1)})$, for any $\M \geq 1$. We obtain our tight bounds by
using two proof techniques: {\em transformation}, which we use to convert
arbitrary games to simpler games, and {\em expansion}, which we use to bound
the price of anarchy in a simpler game.

saturated, with the absorbing gas covering ~25% of the emitting region. We
explore different scenarios for the emergence of this outflow, and find an

to be dominated by nitrogen ice. Our analysis also suggests, unlike previous

constant with depth into the surface of Eris. Finally, we point out that our
Eris spectrum is also consistent with a laboratory ice mixture consisting of

already-formed disk is one proposed mechanism for producing the short-lived
radionuclides, such as 26Al and 41Ca, inferred from isotopic studies of
meteorites to have existed in the solar nebula. This hypothesis has recently
been challenged on the basis that the injection of enough supernova material to
match the meteoritic abundances of 26Al and 41Ca would produce large,
measureable, and unobserved collateral effects on oxygen isotopes. Here we
calculate again the shifts in oxygen isotopes due to injection of supernova
material in the solar nebula, using a variety of nucleosynthetic conditions of
our own progenitor explosions. Unlike previous studies of this type, we also
consider the effect of non-homogeneity in abundance distribution of the
nucleosynthesis products after the explosion. We calculate the shifts in oxygen
isotopes due to injection of sufficient supernova material to produce the
meteoritic abundances of 26Al and 41Ca, and analyze the predicted shifts in
detail for compatibility with meteoritic data. We find that the range in
possible isotopic shifts is considerable and sensitive to parameters such as
progenitor mass and anisotropy of the explosion; however, a small number of
compatible scenarios do exist. Because of the wide range of outcomes and the
sensitivity of isotopic yields to assumed conditions, it is difficult to
constrain the supernova that may have led to injection of 26Al in the solar
nebula. Conversely, we argue that the existence of viable counterexamples
demonstrates that it is premature to use oxygen isotopes to rule out injection
of 26Al and 41Ca into the solar nebula protoplanetary disk by a nearby
supernova.

free charge carriers. Theoretical results for the thermal Casimir force acting
between metallic, dielectric and semiconductor materials are presented and
compared with available experimental data. Main attention is concentrated on
the possibility to control the magnitude and sign of the Casimir force for
applications in nanotechnology. In this respect we consider experiments on the
optical modulation of the Casimir force between metal and semiconductor test
bodies with laser light. Another option is the use of ferromagnetic materials,
specifically, ferromagnetic dielectrics. Under some conditions this allows to
get Casimir repulsion. The lateral Casimir force acting between sinusoidally
corrugated surfaces can be considered as some kind of noncontact friction
caused by zero-point oscillations of the electromagnetic field. Recent
experiments and computations using the exact theory have demonstrated the role
of diffraction-type effects in this phenomenon and the possibility to get
asymmetric force profiles. Conclusion is made that the Casimir force may play
important role in the operation of different devices on the nanoscale.

to introduce a new approach to dimensionality reduction based on L1

mesoscale dynamics of large ODE systems. The underlying microscale model
consists of classical Newton equations of particle dynamics. As a mesoscale
model we use the balance equations for spatial averages obtained earlier by a
number of authors: Murdoch and Bedeaux, Hardy, Noll and others. The momentum
balance equation contains a flux (stress), which is given by an exact function
of particle positions and velocities. We propose a method for approximating
this function by a sequence of operators applied to average density and
momentum. The resulting approximate mesoscopic models are systems in closed
form. The closed from property allows one to work directly with the mesoscale
equaitons without the need to calculate underlying particle trajectories, which
is useful for modeling and simulation of large particle systems. The proposed
closure method utilizes the theory of ill-posed problems, in particular
iterative regularization methods for solving first order linear integral
equations. The closed from approximations are obtained in two steps. First, we
use Landweber regularization to (approximately) reconstruct the interpolants of
relevant microscale quantitites from the average density and momentum. Second,
these reconstructions are substituted into the exact formulas for stress. The
developed general theory is then applied to non-linear oscillator chains. We
conduct a detailed study of the simplest zero-order approximation, and show
numerically that it works well as long as fluctuations of velocity are nearly

out that a variety of mechanisms may contribute to the mid-infrared (MIR)

transitions, and appreciable emission by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons

warmer grains, and the possible contribution of H2 transitions. It is suggested
that an apparent jet-like structure to the NE of the halo represents one of the
many emission spokes that permeate the shell. The spokes are likely to be
caused by the percolation of UV photons through a clumpy interior shell, whilst
the jet-like feature is enhanced due to locally elevated electron densities; a
result of interaction between NGC 40 and the interstellar medium. It is finally
noted that the presence of the PAH, 21 microns and 30 microns spectral features

we obtain a new classification of p-adic representations of G_K = Gal(Kbar/K)
by some (phi, \tau)-modules. We then make a link between the theory of
(phi,tau)-modules discussed above and the so-called theory of
(phi,N_nabla)$-modules developped by Kisin. As a corollary, we answer a
question of Tong Liu: we prove that, if K is a finite extension of Q_p, every
representation of G_K of E(u)-finite height is potentially semi-stable.

theories arising in fluid dynamics, magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), and the
dynamics of complex fluids. A central role in these discretizations is played
by the geometric formulation of fluid dynamics, which views solutions to the
governing equations for perfect fluid flow as geodesics on the group of
volume-preserving diffeomorphisms of the fluid domain. Inspired by this
framework, we construct a finite-dimensional approximation to the
diffeomorphism group and its Lie algebra, thereby permitting a variational
temporal discretization of geodesics on the spatially discretized
diffeomorphism group. The extension to MHD and complex fluid flow is then made
through an appeal to the theory of Euler-Poincar\'{e} systems with advection,
which provides a generalization of the variational formulation of ideal fluid
flow to fluids with one or more advected parameters. Upon deriving a family of
structured integrators for these systems, we test their performance via a
numerical implementation of the update schemes on a cartesian grid. Among the
hallmarks of these new numerical methods are exact preservation of momenta
arising from symmetries, automatic satisfaction of solenoidal constraints on
vector fields, good long-term energy behavior, robustness with respect to the
spatial and temporal resolution of the discretization, and applicability to
irregular meshes.

However, communication links are increasingly operating at shorter ranges where
transmit power can be significantly smaller than the power consumed in

minimization of total system power from two complementary perspectives.
  First, an isolated point-to-point link is considered. Using new lower bounds
on the complexity of message-passing decoding, lower bounds are derived on
decoding power. These bounds show that 1) there is a fundamental tradeoff
between transmit and decoding power; 2) unlike the implications of the
traditional ""waterfall"" curve which focuses on transmit power, the total power
must diverge to infinity as error probability goes to zero; 3) Regular LDPCs,
and not their known capacity-achieving irregular counterparts, can be shown to
be power order optimal in some cases; and 4) the optimizing transmit power is
bounded away from the Shannon limit.
  Second, we consider a collection of links. When systems both generate and
face interference, coding allows a system to support a higher density of
transmitter-receiver pairs (assuming interference is treated as noise).
However, at low densities, uncoded transmission may be more power-efficient in
some cases.

(SAR). The thesis is structured as follows: The first chapter explains what SAR
is, and the physical and mathematical background is illuminated. The following
chapter points out a problem with a divergent integral in a common approach and
proposes an improvement. Numerical comparisons are shown that indicate that the
improvements allow for a superior image quality. Thereafter the problem of
limited data is analyzed. In a realistic SAR-measurement the data gathered from
the electromagnetic waves reflected from the surface can only be collected from
a limited area. However the reconstruction formula requires data from an
infinite distance. The chapter gives an analysis of the artifacts which can
obscure the reconstructed images due to this problem. Additionally, some
numerical examples are shown that point to the severity of the problem. In
chapter 4 the fact that data is available only from a limited area is used to
propose a new inversion formula. This inversion formula has the potential to
make it easier to suppress artifacts due to limited data and, depending on the
application, can be refined to a fast reconstruction formula. In the
penultimate chapter a solution to the problem of left-right ambiguity is
presented. This problem exists since the invention of SAR and is caused by the
geometry of the measurements. This leads to the fact that only symmetric images
can be obtained. With the solution from this chapter it is possible to
reconstruct not only the even part of the reflectivity function, but also the
odd part, thus making it possible to reconstruct asymmetric images. Numerical
simulations are shown to demonstrate that this solution is not affected by
stability problems as other approaches have been. The final chapter develops
some continuative ideas that could be pursued in the future.

this constant. ($H_p$ is full penetration field.) This different value of the
Kim constant for the same hysteresis loop has been made a base for a different

$H_0$ corresponds to the original Kim model and the value 0.3424$H_p$, denoted
by a different notation $H_{0,hys}$, corresponds to the hysteretic Kim model.
The two versions of the Kim model are interrelated so that $H_{0,hys}$ is a
function of $H_0$. An empirical relation,
$H_{0,hys}$=0.3424$H_p$exp(1.4$^{0.5}$($H_0$/$H_p$)), has been worked out on
the basis of the theoretical $H_0$>0 hysteresis loops. The hysteretic Kim model
has been cast in a practically useful form by obtaining an expression of $H_p$
in terms of the hysteretic magnetization. The importance of the hysteretic Kim
model has been illustrated by applying it to the YBa$-2$Cu$_3$O$_7$,
Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ and Ba$_0.72$K$_0.28$Fe$_2$As$_2$
superconductors by taking hysteresis loops of these systems from literature. It
has been found that in these superconductors the dependence of $H_p$ on the
sample width is mainly like $^{0.5}$(2$a$), and not like 2$a$ (Bean model).
(2$a$ is the sample width.) The empirical relation of $H_{0,hys}$ and $H_0$ has

predominant association of extragalactic gamma-ray emitters to active galaxies,

from active galaxies to their highly relativistic outflows. We investigate the
Caltech-Jodrell Bank flat-spectrum (CJF) sample to study the connection between
AGN jet kinematics and their gamma-ray properties. The high number of sources
included in the sample, in addition to the excellent kinematic data available,
allows us to investigate the origin of gamma-ray emission in AGN. We identify
the CJF sources detected in gamma-rays (by Fermi-LAT and EGRET). We use
gamma-ray luminosities and the available VLBI kinematic data to look for
correlations between gamma-ray and kinematic properties, as well as for
differences between AGN classes (quasars, BL Lacs, radio galaxies). We also
check the kinematics of the TeV sources in the CJF. 21.8% of the CJF has been
detected in the gamma-rays. We find the detectability of BL Lacs significantly
higher compared to quasars. gamma-detected sources show a wider apparent jet
velocity distribution compared to the non-detected ones, but the maxima of both
distributions are at similar values. No strong link between gamma-ray
detectability and fast apparent jet speeds is found. A tentative correlation is
found between gamma-ray luminosity and maximum apparent jet speeds, stronger
for BL Lac and gamma-variable sources. We find non-radial jet motions to be
important to gamma-ray emission. We suggest two-zone, spine-sheath, models as a
possible explanation to our results. We find 2 out of 4 CJF TeV sources show
superluminal jet speeds, in contrast to previous studies.
