elliptical galaxies, mostly members of small groups. The galaxies under
consideration have a typical absolute magnitude of -18 (B-band), and at the
Kormendy's relation they settle within a transition zone between the main cloud
of giant ellipticals and the sequence of diffuse ellipticals. By measuring Lick
indices and investigating radial profiles of the SSP-equivalent ages and
metallicities of the stellar populations in their central parts, I have found
evolutionary distinct cores in all of them. Typically, the ages of these cores
are 2-4 Gyr, and the metallicities are higher than the solar one. Outside the
cores, the stellar populations are always old, T>12 Gyr, and the metallicities
are subsolar. This finding implies that the well-known correlation between the
stellar age and the total mass (luminosity) of field ellipticals (Trager et al.
2000, Caldwell et al. 2003, Howell 2005) may be in fact a direct consequence of
a larger contribution of nuclear starbursts into the integrated stellar
population in dwarfs with respect to giants, and does not relate to
`downsizing'.

doping for Ru reduces the temperature of the orthorhombic distortion at TMI and

total volume expansion {\Delta}V/V {\simeq} 1 %, which sharply contrasts the
smooth temperature dependence of the few known examples of negative volume
thermal expansion driven by anharmonic phonon modes. In addition, the near
absence of volume thermal expansion between TC and TMI represents an Invar

extraordinary coupling between spin, orbit and lattice degrees of freedom.

$f(\mathbf{v},\bm{\omega})$ of linear ($\mathbf{v}$) and angular

translational ($T^\text{tr}$) and rotational ($T^\text{rot}$) temperatures. The
deviation of $f$ from the Maxwellian distribution parameterized by
$T^\text{tr}$ and $T^\text{rot}$ can be measured by the cumulants associated
with the fourth-degree velocity moments. The main objective of this paper is
the evaluation of the collisional rates of change of these second- and
fourth-degree moments by means of a Sonine approximation. The results are
subsequently applied to the computation of the temperature ratio
$T^\text{rot}/T^\text{tr}$ and the cumulants of two paradigmatic states: the
homogeneous cooling state and the homogeneous steady state driven by a
white-noise stochastic thermostat. It is found in both cases that the
Maxwellian approximation for the temperature ratio does not deviate much from
the Sonine prediction. On the other hand, non-Maxwellian properties measured by
the cumulants cannot be ignored, especially in the homogeneous cooling state
for medium and small roughness. In that state, moreover, the cumulant directly
related to the translational velocity differs in the quasi-smooth limit
$\beta\to -1$ from that of pure smooth spheres ($\beta=-1$). This singular
behavior is directly related to the unsteady character of the homogeneous
cooling state and thus it is absent in the stochastic thermostat case.

minimization is low in case of circuits with lesser input leads in gates
compared to greater input leads in gates for the boolean expression with same

large number of tests find the same faults. The new approach is implemented for
simple circuits. The results show potential for both smaller test sets and

Schwarzschild background a scheme in accordance with quantum unitarity. In this
scheme the semi-classical approximation of the unitary quantum - horizonless -
black hole S-matrix leads to the conventional description of the Hawking
radiation from a classical black hole endowed with an event horizon. Unitarity
is borne out by the detailed exclusive S-matrix amplitudes. There, the fixing
of generic out-states, in addition to the in-state, yields in asymptotic
Minkowski space-time saddle-point contributions which are dominated by
Planckian metric fluctuations when approaching the Schwarzschild radius. We
argue that these prevent the corresponding macroscopic ""exclusive backgrounds""
to develop an event horizon. However, if no out-state is selected, a distinct
saddle-point geometry can be defined, in which Planckian fluctuations are
tamed. Such ""inclusive background"" presents an event horizon and constitutes a
coarse-grained average over the aforementioned exclusive ones. The classical
event horizon appears as a coarse-grained structure, sustaining the
thermodynamic significance of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. This is
reminiscent of the tentative fuzzball description of extremal black holes: the
role of microstates is played here by a complete set of out-states. Although
the computations of unitary amplitudes would require a detailed theory of
quantum gravity, the proposed scheme itself, which appeals to the metric
description of gravity only in the vicinity of stationary points, does not.

respectively. We derive estimates of black hole masses via stellar velocity
dispersion and bulge luminosity. We find that masses delivered by both methods
are consistent within errors. There is no difference between the black hole
mass ranges for high-synchrotron peaked BL Lacs (HBL) and low-synchrotron
peaked BL Lacs (LBL). A correlation between the black-hole mass and radio,
optical and X-ray luminosity has been found at a high significance level. The
optical-continuum emission correlates with the jet luminosity as well. Besides,
X-ray and radio emission are correlated when HBLs and LBLs are considered
separately. Results presented in this work: (i) show that the black hole mass
does not decide the SED shapes of BL Lacs, (ii) confirm that X-ray and optical
emission is associated to the relativistic jet, and (iii) present evidence of a
relation between MBH and Doppler boosted emission, which among BL Lacs may be
understood as a close relation between faster jets and more massive black
holes.

is the appearance of relatively cloud-free regions across the disk of brown
dwarfs as they cool. The existence of partly cloudy regions has been supported
by evidence for variability in dwarfs in the late L to early T spectral range,
but no self-consistent atmosphere models of such partly cloudy objects have yet
been constructed. Here we present a new approach for consistently modeling
partly cloudy brown dwarfs and giant planets. We find that even a small
fraction of cloud holes dramatically alter the atmospheric thermal profile,
spectra, and photometric colors of a given object. With decreasing cloudiness
objects briskly become bluer in J - K and brighten in J band, as is observed at
the L/T transition. Model spectra of partly cloudy objects are similar to our
models with globally homogenous, but thinner, clouds. Hence spectra alone may
not be sufficient to distinguish partial cloudiness although variability and
polarization measurements are potential observational signatures. Finally we
note that partial cloud cover may be an alternative explanation for the blue L
dwarfs.

continuous one, with no underlying thermodynamic singularity. Similar results
are obtained for facilitated spin models on a diluted Bethe lattice. The

bootstrap and standard percolation and corresponds to a crossover from a
compact to a fractal structure of the incipient spanning cluster of frozen

full swing. The ATLAS trigger system is divided into three levels: the
hardware-based first level trigger, and the software-based second level trigger
and Event Filter, collectively referred to as the High Level Trigger (HLT).
Initially, events have been selected online based on the Level-1 selections
with the HLT algorithms run but not rejecting any events. This has been an
important step in the commissioning of these triggers to ensure their correct
functioning and subsequently to enable the HLT selections. Due to increasing
LHC luminosity and the large QCD cross section, this has been a vital step to
select leptons from J/$\Psi$, bottom, charm, W and Z decays.
  This presentation gives an overview of the trigger performance of the
electron and photon selection. Comparisons of the online selection variables
with the offline reconstruction are shown as well as comparisons of data with
MC simulations on which the current selection tuning is performed.

of finite groups: functions f:G -> U_d such that Pr[f(xy) = f(x) f(y)] is
large, or more generally Exp_{x,y} ||f(xy) - f(x)f(y)||^2$ is small, where x
and y are uniformly random elements of the group G and U_d denotes the unitary
group of degree d. We bound these quantities in terms of the ratio d / d_min
where d_min is the dimension of the smallest nontrivial representation of G. As
an application, we bound the extent to which a function f : G -> H can be an
approximate homomorphism where H is another finite group. We show that if H's
representations are significantly smaller than G's, no such f can be much more
homomorphic than a random function.
  We interpret these results as showing that if G is quasirandom, that is, if
d_min is large, then G cannot be embedded in a small number of dimensions, or
in a less-quasirandom group, without significant distortion of G's
multiplicative structure. We also prove that our bounds are tight by showing

at different redshifts. The locations of lensed images can be used to constrain
cosmological parameters due to their dependence on the ratio of angular
diameter distances. We employ Monte-Carlo simulations of cluster lenses,
including the contribution from substructures, to assess the feasibility of
this potentially powerful technique. At the present, parametric lens models use
well motivated scaling relations between mass and light to incorporate cluster
member galaxies, and do not explicitly model line-of-sight structure. Here, we
quantify modeling errors due to scatter in the cluster galaxy scaling relations
and un-modeled line-of-sight halos. These errors are of the order of a few
arcseconds on average for clusters located at typical redshifts (z ~ 0.2 -
0.3). Using Bayesian Markov Chain Monte-Carlo techniques, we show that the
inclusion of these modeling errors is critical to deriving unbiased constraints
on dark energy. However, when the uncertainties are properly quantified, we
show that constraints competitive with other methods may be obtained by
combining results from a sample of just 10 simulated clusters with 20 families
each. Cosmography with a set of well studied cluster lenses may provide a
powerful complementary probe of the dark energy equation of state. Our
simulations provide a convenient method of quantifying modeling errors and
assessing future strong lensing survey strategies.

series of unstratified simulations to calibrate physical dissipation as a
function of resolution and background field strength; the effect of the
magnetic Prandtl number, Pm = viscosity/resistivity, on the turbulence is
captured by ~32 grid zones per disk scale height, H. In agreement with previous
results, our stratified disk calculations are characterized by a subthermal,
predominately toroidal magnetic field that produces MRI-driven turbulence for
|z| < 2 H. Above |z| = 2 H, magnetic pressure dominates and the field is
buoyantly unstable. Large scale radial and toroidal fields are also generated
near the mid-plane and subsequently rise through the disk. The polarity of this
mean field switches on a roughly 10 orbit period in a process that is
well-modeled by an alpha-omega dynamo. Turbulent stress increases with Pm but
with a shallower dependence compared to unstratified simulations. For
sufficiently large resistivity, on the order of cs H/1000, where cs is the
sound speed, MRI turbulence within 2 H of the mid-plane undergoes periods of
resistive decay followed by regrowth. This regrowth is caused by amplification
of toroidal field via the dynamo. This process results in large amplitude
variability in the stress on 10 to 100 orbital timescales, which may have
relevance for partially ionized disks that are observed to have high and low
accretion states.

commonly done in MRF models with robust potentials (such as stereo) that impose
an upper bound on the penalty assigned to discontinuities; for each of the $M$

a neighboring node are assigned milder penalties. The computational complexity
of our method is $O(mM)$, compared with $O(M^2)$ for standard BP, and we

Unlike some previous work on speeding up BP, our method applies both to
sum-product and max-product BP, which makes it useful in any applications where
marginal probabilities are required, such as maximum likelihood estimation. We
demonstrate the technique on a stereo MRF example, confirming that the

the hidden sector and is charged under a stabilizing symmetry shared by both

broad framework. We show that DM can arise only through a handful of
mechanisms, lending particular focus to Freeze-Out and Decay and Freeze-In, as
well as their variations involving late time re-annihilations of DM and DM
particle anti-particle asymmetries. Much like standard Freeze-Out, where the
abundance of DM depends only on the annihilation cross-section of the DM
particle, these mechanisms depend only on a very small subset of physical
parameters, many of which may be measured directly at the LHC. In particular,
we show that each DM production mechanism is associated with a distinctive
window in lifetimes and cross-sections for particles which may be produced in

weakly to visible sector fields. Portal interactions connecting visible and

into the LSP, allowing the LHC to function as a spectacular probe of the origin
of hidden sector DM. As shown in a companion paper, this general two-sector

maps to a distinctive window in lifetimes and cross-sections for the LOSP. In
the present work we perform a systematic collider study of LOSP candidates and
portal interactions, and for each case evaluate the prospects for successfully
reconstructing the origin of DM at the LHC. If, for instance, DM arises from
Freeze-Out and Decay, this may be verified if the LOSP is a bino or
right-handed slepton decaying to the LSP through a variety of portal
interactions, and with an annihilation cross-section within a narrow range. On
the other hand, the Freeze-In mechanism may be verified for a complimentary set
of LOSP candidates, and within a narrow range of LOSP lifetimes. In all cases,
the LOSP is relatively long-lived on collider time scales, leading to events
with displaced vertices. Furthermore, scenarios with a charged or colored LOSP

isolated mathematical objects --- most often defined by very strong simplifying
assumptions concerning rationality, efficiency and the existence of
disequilibrium adjustment mechanisms. This raises the important question of how
sensitive such models might be to real-world effects that violate the
assumptions. We show how the consequences of rational behavior caused by
perverse incentives, as well as various irrational tendencies identified by
behavioral economists, can be systematically and consistently introduced into
an agent-based model for a financial asset. This generates a class of models
which, in the special case where such effects are absent, reduces to geometric
Brownian motion --- the usual equilibrium pricing model. Thus we are able to
numerically perturb a widely-used equilibrium pricing model market and
investigate its stability. The magnitude of such perturbations in real markets
can be estimated and the simulations imply that this is far outside the
stability region of the equilibrium solution, which is no longer observed.
Indeed the price fluctuations generated by endogenous dynamics, are in good
general agreement with the excess kurtosis and heteroskedasticity of actual
asset prices. The methodology is presented within the context of a financial
market. However, there are close links to concepts and theories from both
micro- and macro-economics including rational expectations, Soros' theory of
reflexivity, and Minsky's theory of financial instability.

related to the behavior of many dynamical processes run over the network. In

robots. In this paper, we propose a continuous-time control scheme that
modifies the structure of a position-dependent network of mobile robots so that
it achieves a desired set of adjacency eigenvalues. For this, we employ a novel
abstraction of the eigenvalue spectrum by means of the adjacency matrix
spectral moments. Since the eigenvalue spectrum is uniquely determined by its
spectral moments, this abstraction provides a way to indirectly control the
eigenvalues of the network. Our construction is based on artificial potentials
that capture the distance of the network's spectral moments to their desired
values. Minimization of these potentials is via a gradient descent closed-loop
system that, under certain convexity assumptions, ensures convergence of the
network topology to one with the desired set of moments and, therefore,
eigenvalues. We illustrate our approach in nontrivial computer simulations.

Since the ratio of electric charge and baryon asymmetries is proportional to
$R_{EB}$, the measurement of baryon and electric charge asymmetry fluctuations
should allow to separate clearly the CME and CVE contributions. In both cases,
there has to be a positive correlation between the charge and baryon number

So far, the impact of multi-stage sensing on network throughput and collision
probability for a realistic network model is relatively unexplored. Therefore,
we present the first analytical framework which enables performance evaluation
of different multi-channel multi-stage spectrum sensing algorithms for
Opportunistic Spectrum Access networks. The contribution of our work lies in
studying the effect of the following parameters on performance: number of
sensing stages, physical layer sensing techniques and durations per each stage,
single and parallel channel sensing and access, number of available channels,
primary and secondary user traffic, buffering of incoming secondary user
traffic, as well as MAC layer sensing algorithms. Analyzed performance metrics
include the average secondary user throughput and the average collision
probability between primary and secondary users. Our results show that when the
probability of primary user mis-detection is constrained, the performance of
multi-stage sensing is, in most cases, superior to the single stage sensing
counterpart. Besides, prolonged channel observation at the first stage of
sensing decreases the collision probability considerably, while keeping the
throughput at an acceptable level. Finally, in realistic primary user traffic
scenarios, using two stages of sensing provides a good balance between
secondary users throughput and collision probability while meeting successful
detection constraints subjected by Opportunistic Spectrum Access communication.

reduced to a matrix equation expanded by a set of orthogonal molecular states,
describing external center-of-mass motions of pairs of interacting particles;
while each matrix element is guaranteed to be finite by a proper
renormalization for internal relative motions. This approach is able to
incorporate various scattering problems and the calculations of related
physical quantities in a single framework, and also provides a physically
transparent way to understand the mechanism of resonance scattering. For
applications, we study two-body effective scattering in 2D-3D mixed dimensions,
where the resonance position and width are determined with high precision from
only a few number of matrix elements. We also study three fermions in a
(rotating) harmonic trap, where exotic scattering properties in terms of mass
ratios and angular momenta are uniquely identified in the framework of
T-matrix.

emerged as one of the best observational probes of primordial non-Gaussianity
of the local type (i.e. f_{NL}^{local}). This type of non-Gaussianity can be
generated in multifield models of inflation such as the curvaton model.
Recently, Tseliakhovich, Hirata, and Slosar showed that the clustering
statistics depend qualitatively on the ratio of inflaton to curvaton power \xi
after reheating, a free parameter of the model. If \xi is significantly
different from zero, so that the inflaton makes a non-negligible contribution
to the primordial adiabatic curvature, then the peak-background split ansatz
predicts that the halo bias will be stochastic on large scales. In this paper,
we test this prediction in N-body simulations. We find that large-scale
stochasticity is generated, in qualitative agreement with the prediction, but
that the level of stochasticity is overpredicted by ~30%. Other predictions,
such as \xi independence of the halo bias, are confirmed by the simulations.
Surprisingly, even in the Gaussian case we do not find that halo model
predictions for stochasticity agree consistently with simulations, suggesting
that semi-analytic modeling of stochasticity is generally more difficult than
modeling halo bias.

time-varying condition of each channel (e.g., as a result of random fading or
certain primary users' activities) is modeled as an arbitrary finite-state
Markov chain. At each instance of time, a (secondary) user probes a channel and
collects a certain reward as a function of the state of the channel (e.g., good
channel condition results in higher data rate for the user). Each channel has
potentially different state space and statistics, both unknown to the user, who
tries to learn which one is the best as it goes and maximizes its usage of the
best channel. The objective is to construct a good online learning algorithm so
as to minimize the difference between the user's performance in total rewards
and that of using the best channel (on average) had it known which one is the
best from a priori knowledge of the channel statistics (also known as the
regret). This is a classic exploration and exploitation problem and results
abound when the reward processes are assumed to be iid. Compared to prior work,
the biggest difference is that in our case the reward process is assumed to be
Markovian, of which iid is a special case. In addition, the reward processes
are restless in that the channel conditions will continue to evolve independent
of the user's actions. This leads to a restless bandit problem, for which there
exists little result on either algorithms or performance bounds in this
learning context to the best of our knowledge. In this paper we introduce an
algorithm that utilizes regenerative cycles of a Markov chain and computes a
sample-mean based index policy, and show that under mild conditions on the
state transition probabilities of the Markov chains this algorithm achieves
logarithmic regret uniformly over time, and that this regret bound is also
optimal.

constitutes a fundamental process in astronomy and astrophysics. The diffusion
of cosmic-rays through these magnetically turbulent environments is often
studied through the use of energy-dependent diffusion coefficients, although
these are not always well motivated theoretically. Now, however, it is feasible
to perform detailed numerical simulations of the diffusion process
computationally. While the general problem depends upon both the field
structure and particle energy, the analysis may be greatly simplified by
dimensionless analysis. That is, for a specified purely turbulent field, the
analysis depends almost exclusively on a single parameter -- the ratio of the
maximum wavelength of the turbulent field cells to the particle gyration
radius. For turbulent magnetic fluctuations superimposed over an underlying
uniform magnetic field, particle diffusion depends on a second dimensionless
parameter that characterizes the ratio of the turbulent to uniform magnetic
field energy densities. We consider both of these possibilities and parametrize
our results to provide simple quantitative expressions that suitably
characterize the diffusion process within molecular cloud environments. Doing
so, we find that the simple scaling laws often invoked by the high-energy
astrophysics community to model cosmic-ray diffusion through such regions
appear to be fairly robust for the case of a uniform magnetic field with a
strong turbulent component, but are only valid up to $\sim 50$ TeV particle
energies for a purely turbulent field. These results have important
consequences for the analysis of cosmic-ray processes based on TeV emission
spectra associated with dense molecular clouds.

from on-sky measurements, and is made available to the public. When applied to
widely dithered images, it produces residuals in the separations of stars that
are a factor of ~3 smaller compared to the outcome using previous models. By
applying this new model, along with corrections for differential atmospheric
refraction, to widely dithered images of SiO masers at the Galactic center, we
improve our ability to tie into the precisely measured radio Sgr A*-rest frame.
The resulting infrared reference frame is ~2-3 times more accurate and stable
than earlier published efforts. In this reference frame, Sgr A* is localized to
within a position of 0.6 mas and a velocity of 0.09 mas/yr, or ~3.4 km/s at 8
kpc (1 sigma). While earlier proper motion studies defined a reference frame by
assuming no net motion of the stellar cluster, this approach is fundamentally
limited by the cluster's intrinsic dispersion and therefore will not improve
with time. We define a reference frame with SiO masers and this reference
frame's stability should improve steadily with future measurements of the SiO
masers in this region. This is essential for achieving the necessary reference
frame stability required to detect the effects of general relativity and
extended mass on short-period stars at the Galactic center.

Starting from the Schr\""{o}dinger equation for a single particle it is

Wigner-Moyal type of equation also exists in the classical field theory. As an
example, from the Maxwell equations the Wigner-Moyal type of equation is
obtained for a dense photon gas, which is classical, concluding that the
Wigner-Moyal type of equation can be derived for any system, classical or
quantum. A new type of quantum kinetic equations are presented. These novel
kinetic equations allow to obtain a set of quantum hydrodynamic equations,
which is impossible to derive by the Wigner-Moyal equation. The propagation of
small perturbations and instabilities of these perturbations are then
discussed, presenting new modes of quantum plasma waves. In the case of low
frequency oscillations with ions, a new Bogolyubov type of spectrum is found.
Furthermore, the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation is derived and the

of sin(2beta) from the well-known B_d^0 -> J/psi K_S mode with the help of the

enter a territory of precision which makes the control of doubly

enhanced through new physics, is a key parameter for these analyses. We find
that the mixing-induced CP violation S(B_s^0 -> J/psi K_S) shows an interesting

studied as an anti-Copernican universe model to explain the acceleration of
cosmic volume expansion without introducing the concept of dark energy. One of
decisive differences between LTB universe models and Copernican universe models
with dark energy is believed to be the redshift drift. The redshift drift is
negative in all known LTB universe models, whereas it is positive in the
redshift domain $z \lesssim 2$ in Copernican models with dark energy. However,
there have been no detailed studies on this subject. In the present paper, we
prove that the redshift drift of an off-center source is always negative in the

disappear as a prelude to final thermalization and their annihilation is
related to the contraction of vortex rings due to mutual friction. Increasing
the amount of dispersion at truncation wavenumber is shown to slowdown
thermalization and vortex annihilation. A bottleneck that produces spontaneous
effective self truncation with partial thermalization is characterized in the
limit of large dispersive effects. Metastable counter-flow states are generated
using the SGLE algorithm. Spontaneous nucleation of vortex ring is observed and
the corresponding Arrhenius law is characterized. Dynamical counter-flow

The vortex ring longitudinal velocity has a strong dependence on temperature,
an effect that is related to the presence of finite-amplitude Kelvin waves.

results are also combined with the results of other solar neutrino experiments.

are of first importance for the modeling of gas phase interstellar chemistry.
Despite experimental and theoretical efforts that have been done during the
last two decades there is still a strong lack of detailed information on those
quantities for many molecules such as Cn, CnH or C3H2. Our aim is to provide
astrochemical databases with more realistic branching ratios for Cn (n=2 to
10), CnH (n=2 to 4), and C3H2 molecules that are electronically excited either
by dissociative recombination, photodissociation, or cosmic ray processes, when
no detailed calculations or measurements exist in literature. High velocity
collision in an inverse kinematics scheme was used to measure the complete
fragmentation pattern of electronically excited Cn (n=2 to 10), CnH (n=2 to 4),
and C3H2 molecules. Branching ratios of dissociation where deduced from those
experiments. The full set of branching ratios was used as a new input in
chemical models and branching ratio modification effects observed in
astrochemical networks that describe the dense cold Taurus Molecular Cloud-1
and the photon dominated Horse Head region. The comparison between the
branching ratios obtained in this work and other types of experiments showed a
good agreement. It was interpreted as the signature of a statistical behavior
of the fragmentation. The branching ratios we obtained lead to an increase of
the C3 production together with a larger dispersion of the daughter fragments.
The introduction of these new values in the photon dominated region model of
the Horse Head nebula increases the abundance of C3 and C3H, but reduces the
abundances of the larger Cn and hydrocarbons at a visual extinction Av smaller
than 4.

far, statistical analysis was performed by testing markers individually. In
this article we present some elementary statistical considerations which
clearly show that in case of complex traits the approach based on multiple
regression or generalized linear models is preferable to multiple testing. We
introduce a model selection approach to GWAS based on modifications of Bayesian
Information Criterion (BIC) and develop some simple search strategies to deal
with the huge number of potential models. Comprehensive simulations based on
real SNP data confirm that model selection has larger power than multiple
testing to detect causal SNPs in complex models. On the other hand multiple
testing has substantial problems with proper ranking of causal SNPs and tends
to detect a certain number of false positive SNPs, which are not linked to any
of the causal mutations. We show that this behavior is typical in GWAS for
complex traits and can be explained by an aggregated influence of many small
random sample correlations between genotypes of a SNP under investigation and
other causal SNPs. We believe that our findings at least partially explain
problems with low power and nonreplicability of results in many real data GWAS.
Finally, we discuss the advantages of our model selection approach in the
context of real data analysis, where we consider publicly available gene
expression data as traits for individuals from the HapMap project.

absorption features with equivalent widths (EWs) of 50 - 200 eV, whose nature
is not yet well known. To explain the prominent absorption features in the soft
X-ray spectra of the highly magnetized (B ~ 10^{14} G) X-ray dim isolated NSs
(XDINSs), we theoretically investigate different NS local surface models,
including naked condensed iron surfaces and partially ionized hydrogen model
atmospheres, with semi-infinite and thin atmospheres above the condensed
surface. We also developed a code for computing light curves and integral
emergent spectra of magnetized neutron stars with various temperature and
magnetic field distributions over the NS surface. We compare the general
properties of the computed and observed light curves and integral spectra for
XDINS RBS\,1223 and conclude that the observations can be explained by a thin
hydrogen atmosphere above the condensed iron surface, while the presence of a
strong toroidal magnetic field component on the XDINS surface is unlikely. We
suggest that the harmonically spaced absorption features in the soft X-ray
spectrum of the central compact object (CCO) 1E 1207.4-5209 (hereafter 1E 1207)
correspond to peaks in the energy dependence of the free-free opacity in a

classical simulations} of physical processes are programs running on Turing

complexity theory is applied to classical simulations of systems performing an
adiabatic quantum computation (AQC), based on an annealed extension of the
density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). We conjecture that the
computational time required for those classical simulations is controlled
solely by the {\em maximal entanglement} found during the process. Thus, lower
bounds on the growth of entanglement with the system size can be provided. In
some cases, quantum phase transitions can be predicted to take place in certain
inhomogeneous systems. Concretely, physical conclusions are drawn from the
assumption that the complexity classes {\bf P} and {\bf NP} differ. As a
by-product, an alternative measure of entanglement is proposed which, via
Chebyshev's inequality, allows to establish strict bounds on the required

[4].
In [17] a connection to topological properties of (a box complex of) the graph
was established and in [18] it was shown that if a graph is strongly
topologically 4-chromatic then its local chromatic number is at least four. As
a consequence one obtains a generalization of the following theorem of Youngs:
If a quadrangulation of the projective plane is not bipartite it has chromatic
number four. The generalization states that in this case the local chromatic
number is also four. Both papers [1] and [13] generalize Youngs's result to
arbitrary non-orientable surfaces replacing the condition of the graph being
not bipartite by a more technical condition of an odd quadrangulation. This
paper investigates when these general results are true for the local chromatic
number instead of the chromatic number. Surprisingly, we find out that (unlike
in the case of the chromatic number) this depends on the genus of the surface.
For the non-orientable surfaces of genus at most four, the local chromatic
number of any odd quadrangulation is at least four, but this is not true for
non-orientable surfaces of genus 5 or higher. We also prove that face
subdivisions of odd quadrangulations and Fisk triangulations of arbitrary
surfaces exhibit the same behavior for the local chromatic number as they do
for the usual chromatic number.

nobody wins. In particular, Mephisto cannot win himself, he can only prevent
Dido from winning.
  We show that Dido always possesses a winning strategy, regardless of the
initial shape of the graph and of the moves of Mephisto. This implies --
translating back to algebraic geometry -- that there is a choice of centers for
the blowup of singular varieties in characteristic zero which eventually leads
to their resolution. The algebra needed for this implication is elementary. The
transcription from varieties to graphs and from blowups to modifications of the
graph thus axiomatizes the proof of the resolution of singularities. In
principle, the same logic could also work in positive characteristic, once an
appropriate descent in dimension is settled.

spherical, standing accretion-shock and convective instabilities lead to a
globally asymmetric mass and energy distribution in the postshock layer. An
anisotropic momentum distribution of the ejecta is built up only after the

accretion downdrafts and the anisotropic gravitational pull of large
inhomogeneities in the ejecta. In a limited set of 15 solar-mass models with an
explosion energy of about 10^51 erg this stochastic mechanism is found to
produce kicks from <100 km/s to >500 km/s, and >1000 km/s seem possible. Strong
rotational flows around the accreting NS do not develop in our collapsing,

$e^\pm$ extra-component. In that case, we show that the predicted CRE
anisotropy is compatible with Fermi-LAT constraints and that a positive
detection should be at hand of that observatory. Models assuming that only
nearby supernova remnants contribute to the high energy tail of the observed

global two dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. The large positive corotation
torque is exerted on a planet by an adiabatic disk at early times when the disk
has the steep negative entropy gradient. The gas on the horseshoe orbit of the
planet is compressed adiabatically during the change of the orbit from the slow
orbit to the fast orbit, increasing its density and exerting the positive
torque on the planet. The planet would migrate outward in the adiabatic disk
before saturation sets in. We further study the effect of energy dissipation by
radiation on Type I migration of the planet. The corotation torque decreases
when the energy dissipates effectively because the density of the gas on the
horseshoe orbit does not increase by the compression compared with the gas of
the adiabatic disk. The total torque is mainly determined by the negative
Lindblad torque and becomes negative. The planet migrates inward toward the
central star in the radiatively efficient disk. The migration velocity is
dependent on the radiative efficiency and greatly reduced if the radiative
cooling works inefficiently.

code-division multiple access (MC-CDMA) communication systems. In a coded
MC-CDMA system, the information data multiplexed from users is encoded by a
Reed-Muller subcode and the codeword is fully-loaded to Walsh-Hadamard
spreading sequences. The polynomial representation of a coded MC-CDMA signal is
established for theoretical analysis of the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR).
The Reed-Muller subcodes are defined in a recursive way by the Boolean
functions providing the transmitted MC-CDMA signals with the bounded PAPR as
well as the error correction capability. A connection between the code rates
and the maximum PAPR is theoretically investigated in the coded MC-CDMA.
Simulation results present the statistical evidence that the PAPR of the coded
MC-CDMA signal is not only theoretically bounded, but also statistically
reduced. In particular, the coded MC-CDMA solves the major PAPR problem of
uncoded MC-CDMA by dramatically reducing its PAPR for the small number of
users. Finally, the theoretical and statistical studies show that the
Reed-Muller subcodes are effective coding schemes for peak power control in
MC-CDMA with small and moderate numbers of users, subcarriers, and spreading
factors.
