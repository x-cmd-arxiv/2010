most widely used techniques for dimensionality reduction: successful and
efficiently computable, it is nevertheless plagued by a well-known,
well-documented sensitivity to outliers. Recent work has considered the setting
where each point has a few arbitrarily corrupted components. Yet, in
applications of SVD or PCA such as robust collaborative filtering or
bioinformatics, malicious agents, defective genes, or simply corrupted or
contaminated experiments may effectively yield entire points that are
completely corrupted.
  We present an efficient convex optimization-based algorithm we call Outlier
Pursuit, that under some mild assumptions on the uncorrupted points (satisfied,
e.g., by the standard generative assumption in PCA problems) recovers the exact
optimal low-dimensional subspace, and identifies the corrupted points. Such
identification of corrupted points that do not conform to the low-dimensional
approximation, is of paramount interest in bioinformatics and financial
applications, and beyond. Our techniques involve matrix decomposition using
nuclear norm minimization, however, our results, setup, and approach,
necessarily differ considerably from the existing line of work in matrix
completion and matrix decomposition, since we develop an approach to recover
the correct column space of the uncorrupted matrix, rather than the exact
matrix itself. In any problem where one seeks to recover a structure rather
than the exact initial matrices, techniques developed thus far relying on
certificates of optimality, will fail. We present an important extension of
these methods, that allows the treatment of such problems.

the transition between hadronic and quark matter. Calculations within a
Ginzburg-Landau approach show that the axial anomaly can induce a critical
point in this transition region. This is possible because in three-flavor quark
matter with instanton effects a chiral condensate can be added to the
color-flavor locked (CFL) phase without changing the symmetries of the ground
state. In (massless) two-flavor quark matter such a critical point is not
possible since the corresponding color superconductor (2SC) does not break
chiral symmetry. We study the effects of a nonzero but finite strange quark
mass which interpolates between these two cases. Since at ultra-high density
the first reaction of CFL to a nonzero strange quark mass is to develop a kaon
condensate, we extend previous Ginzburg-Landau studies by including such a
condensate. We discuss the fate of the critical point systematically and show
that the continuity between hadronic and quark matter can be disrupted by the
onset of a kaon condensate. Moreover, we identify the mass terms in the
Ginzburg-Landau potential which are needed for the 2SC phase to occur in the
phase diagram.

Specifically, we extend the modularity-maximization method [Newman and Girvan,

analysis, since it contains a tunable parameter that sets the length scale of

nodes and structures. We apply the proposed method to several benchmark

problems in which the observed value of the CC, $\Lambda$, is linked to other
observable properties of the universe. This is achieved by promoting the CC
from a parameter which must to specified, to a field which can take many
possible values. The observed value of Lambda ~ 1/(9.3 Gyrs)^2$ (approximately
10^(-120) in Planck units) is determined by a new constraint equation which
follows from the application of a causally restricted variation principle. When
applied to our visible universe, the model makes a testable prediction for the
dimensionless spatial curvature of Omega_k0 = -0.0056 s_b/0.5; where s_b ~ 1/2
is a QCD parameter. Requiring that a classical history exist, our model
determines the probability of observing a given Lambda. The observed CC value,
which we successfully predict, is typical within our model even before the
effects of anthropic selection are included. When anthropic selection effects
are accounted for, we find that the observed coincidence between t_Lambda =
Lambda^(-1/2) and the age of the universe, t_U, is a typical occurrence in our
model. In contrast to multiverse explanations of the CC problems, our solution
is independent of the choice of a prior weighting of different $\Lambda$-values
and does not rely on anthropic selection effects. Our model includes no
unnatural small parameters and does not require the introduction of new
dynamical scalar fields or modifications to general relativity, and it can be
tested by astronomical observations in the near future.

the relative velocity (hereafter the tilted velocity) between the two frames,

the magnitude of the tilted velocity $u$ is around 400 km/s, and its direction
is close to what is found from previous bulk flow analyses; for most catalogs
analysed, u=0 is excluded at about the $2.5 \sigma$ level;(2) constraints on
the magnitude of the tilted velocity can result in constraints on the duration
of inflation, due to the fact that inflation can neither be too long (no dipole
effect) nor too short (very large dipole effect); (3) Under the assumption of a
super-horizon isocurvature fluctuation, the constraints on the tilted velocity
require that inflation lasts at least 6 e-folds longer (at the 95% confidence
interval) than that required to solve the horizon problem. This opens a new
window for testing inflation and models of the early Universe from observations

electron temperature Te and emission measure EM are found using the Geometric
mean Emission Measure (GEM) method. The EM derived from the elements Fe, Si, S,

abundance enhancement factors. We also studied the ion temperature Ti and the
non-thermal velocity Vnt using the line profiles. All these measurements are
compared to polar coronal hole observations from the previous (1996-1997) solar
minimum and to model predictions for relative abundances. There are many
similarities in the physical properties of the polar coronal holes between the
two minima at these low heights. We find that Te, electron density Ne, and Ti
are comparable in both minima. Te shows a comparable gradient with height. Both
minima show a decreasing Ti with increasing charge-to-mass ratio q/M. A
previously observed upturn of Ti for ions above q/M > 0.25 was not found here.
We also compared relative coronal-to-photospheric elemental abundance
enhancement factors for a number of elements. These ratios were about 1 for
both the low first ionization potential (FIP) elements Si and Al and the
marginally high FIP element S relative to the low FIP element Fe, as is
expected based on earlier observations and models for a polar coronal hole.
These results are consistent with no FIP effect in a polar coronal hole.

the analog of chiral symmetry breaking of relativistic fermion theories and
produces an insulating gap in the electronic spectrum. Condensed matter systems
with such competing interactions display phenomena that are analogous to the
onset of the chiral condensate and of color superconductivity in dense quark
matter. Evaluation of the free-energy (effective potential) allows us to map
the phases of the system for different values of the couplings of each

coexist if the superconducting and excitonic interactions strengths are equal

interactions is stronger than the other, then only the corresponding order
parameter is non-vanishing and we do not have coexistence. For nonzero values
of chemical potential, the phase diagram for each interaction is obtained
independently. Taking into account only the excitonic interaction, a critical
chemical potential, as a function of the interaction strength, is obtained. If
only the superconducting interaction is considered, the superconducting gap
displays a characteristic dome as charge carriers are doped into the system and
our results qualitatively reproduce the superconducting phase diagram of
several compounds, like 122 pnictides and cuprate superconductors. We also
analyze the possibility of coexistence between Cooper pairs and excitons and we
show that, even if the excitonic interaction strength is greater than the
superconducting interaction, as the chemical potential increases,
superconductivity tends to suppress the excitonic order parameter.

  Bargaining Game",,,,,"cs.GT cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Over the last decade, combinatorial algorithms have been obtained for exactly
solving several nonlinear convex programs. We first provide a formal context to
this activity by introducing the notion of {\em rational convex programs} --
this also enables us to identify a number of questions for further study. So
far, such algorithms were obtained for total problems only. Our main
contribution is developing the methodology for handling non-total problems,
i.e., their associated convex programs may be infeasible for certain settings
of the parameters.
  The specific problem we study pertains to a Nash bargaining game, called
ADNB, which is derived from the linear case of the Arrow-Debreu market model.
We reduce this game to computing an equilibrium in a new market model called
{\em flexible budget market}, and we obtain primal-dual algorithms for
determining feasibility, as well as giving a proof of infeasibility and finding
an equilibrium. We give an application of our combinatorial algorithm for ADNB
to an important ""fair"" throughput allocation problem on a wireless channel.

  The main point of this paper is to show that even non-separable, quasiconcave

natural, realistic and useful, market model; our model allows for perfect price
discrimination. Our model supports unique equilibrium prices and, for the
restriction to concave utilities, satisfies both welfare theorems.

emission peak. The gas masses, gas fractions, moderate CO line excitation, and
star formation efficiencies in these galaxies are consistent with what is found
in nearby luminous infrared galaxies. These observations thus currently
represent the best constraints on the molecular gas content of `ordinary'

rates, the gas properties of these young LBGs seem to be different from the
recently identified optical/infrared-selected high-z massive, gas-rich
star-forming galaxies, which are more gas-rich and massive, but have lower star
formation efficiencies, and presumably trace a different galaxy population.

This ad hoc model is based on the modification of the output of standard
hadronic interaction event generators within the air shower simulation process

shower development. In a systematic study we demonstrate the resulting changes

J102347.6+003841, at a significance of 7 standard deviations, using data
obtained by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. The gamma-ray spectrum can be
described by a power law (PL) with a photon index of 2.9+-0.2, resulting in an
energy flux above 200 MeV of (5.5+-0.9)x10^{-12} erg cm^{-2}s^{-1}. The
gamma-rays likely originate from the MSP PSR J1023+0038, but also possibly from
an intrabinary shock between the pulsar and its companion star. To complement
the gamma-ray study, we also re-investigate the XMM-Newton data taken in 2004

Non-Gaussian infinitely divisible (ID) distributions turn out to be natural
candidates for the initial distribution and then the process $ (X_{t})$ is ID.
We prove a functional large and moderate deviation principle for the partial

induces long memory in the process $ (X_{t})$ and that is reflected in the
large deviation principle. It has been observed in certain short memory
processes that the large deviation principle is very similar to that of an
i.i.d. sequence. Whereas, if the process is long range dependent the large
deviations change dramatically. We show that a similar phenomenon is observed
for infinitely divisible processes driven by Markov chains. Processes of the

the usual stated benefits over other experimental tools is that changes induced
by thermophoresis neither directly depend on, nor directly influence, the
plasma parameters. From electronic data, plasma emission profiles in the
sheath, and Langmuir probe data in the plasma bulk, we conclude that this
assumption does not hold. An important effect on the levitation of dust
particles in argon plasma is observed as well. The reason behind the changes in
plasma parameters seems to be the change in neutral atom density accompanying
the increased gas temperature while running at constant pressure.

spectroscopic data from 814 confirmed supercluster members to produce the first
study of a local rich cluster including both ultraviolet and infrared

the local field population, due largely to the contribution of massive,
quiescent galaxies at M_FUV>-16. The 24um and 70um galaxy LFs for the Shapley
supercluster instead have shapes fully consistent with those obtained for the
Coma cluster and for the local field galaxy population. This apparent lack of
environmental dependence for the shape of the FIR luminosity function suggests
that the bulk of the star-forming galaxies that make up the observed cluster
infrared LF have been recently accreted from the field and have yet to have
their star formation activity significantly affected by the cluster

supercluster core, of which just ~20% is visible directly in the UV continuum

take advantage of this comprehensive panchromatic dataset to perform a detailed

quite independent diagnostics of the quantity and intensity of star formation
to develop a coherent view of the types of star formation within cluster
galaxies. We observe a robust bimodality in the infrared (f_24/f_K) galaxy
colours, which we are able to identify as another manifestation of the broad
split into star-forming spiral and passive elliptical galaxy populations seen
in UV-optical surveys. This diagnostic also allows the identification of
galaxies in the process of having their star formation quenched as the infrared
analogue to the UV ""green valley"" population. The bulk of supercluster galaxies
on the star-forming sequence have specific-SFRs consistent with local field
specific-SFR-M* relations, and form a tight FIR-radio correlation confirming
that their FIR emission is due to star formation. We show that 85% of the
global SFR is quiescent star formation within spiral disks, as manifest by the
observed sequence in the IRX-beta relation being significantly offset from the
starburst relation of Kong et al. (2004), while their FIR-radio colours
indicate dust heated by low-intensity star formation. Just 15% of the global
SFR is due to nuclear starbursts. The vast majority of star formation seen in
cluster galaxies comes from normal infalling spirals who have yet to be
affected by the cluster environment.

11026764 with a precision near 1%, and an accuracy near 2% for the radius and
15% for the age. Continued observations of this star promise to reveal
additional oscillation frequencies that will further improve the determination

increasing interaction of intrinsic states through common decay channels; in
the limit of perfect coupling this process leads to the super-radiance phase
transition. The width distribution depends also on the intrinsic dynamics
(chaotic vs regular). The results presented here are important for
understanding the recent experimental data concerning the width distribution

efficient when the structural error is homoscedastic. Notably our results allow
for imperfect model selection, and do not rely upon the unrealistic ""beta-min""

model selection. In simulation experiments, the Lasso-based IV estimator with a
data-driven penalty performs well compared to recently advocated
many-instrument-robust procedures. In an empirical example dealing with the
effect of judicial eminent domain decisions on economic outcomes, the
Lasso-based IV estimator outperforms an intuitive benchmark.
  In developing the IV results, we establish a series of new results for Lasso

modification of Lasso designed to deal with non-Gaussian, heteroscedastic
disturbances which uses a data-weighted $\ell_1$-penalty function. Using
moderate deviation theory for self-normalized sums, we provide convergence
rates for the resulting Lasso and Post-Lasso estimators that are as sharp as
the corresponding rates in the homoscedastic Gaussian case under the condition

  When W is a well-generated complex reflection group, the noncrossing
partition lattice NCP_W of type W is a very rich combinatorial object,
extending the notion of noncrossing partitions of an n-gon. This structure
appears in several algebraic setups (dual braid monoid, cluster algebras...).
Many combinatorial properties of NCP_W are proved case-by-case, using the
classification of reflection groups. It is the case for Chapoton's formula,
expressing the number of multichains of a given length in the lattice NCP_W, in
terms of the invariant degrees of W. This thesis work is motivated by the
search for a geometric explanation of this formula, which could lead to a
uniform understanding of the connections between the combinatorics of NCP_W and
the invariant theory of W.
  The starting point is to use the Lyashko-Looijenga covering (LL), based on
the geometry of the discriminant of W. In the first chapter, some topological
constructions of Bessis are refined, allowing to relate the fibers of LL with
block factorisations of a Coxeter element. Then we prove a transitivity
property for the Hurwitz action of the braid group B_n on certain
factorisations. Chapter 2 is devoted to certain finite polynomial extensions,
and to properties about their Jacobians and discriminants. In Chapter 3, these
results are applied to the extension defined by the covering LL. We deduce ---
with a case-free proof --- formulas for the number of submaximal factorisations
of a Coxeter element in W, in terms of the homogeneous degrees of the
irreducible components of the discriminant and Jacobian for LL.

theory: of any bandlimited signal it suffices to record discrete samples to be
able to perfectly reconstruct it everywhere, if the samples are taken at a rate
of at least twice the bandlimit. It is known that physical fields on generic

Most recently, methods of spectral geometry have been employed to show that
also the very shape of a curved space (i.e., of a Riemannian manifold) can be

develop these results further, and we here also consider the generalization to

developed using techniques from optimization and statistical estimation. Given
a set of resolved variables that define a model reduction, the
quasi-equilibrium ensembles associated with the resolved variables are employed
as a family of trial probability densities on phase space. The residual that
results from submitting these trial densities to the Liouville equation is
quantified by an ensemble-averaged cost function related to the information
loss rate of the reduction. From an initial nonequilibrium state, the
statistical state of the system at any later time is estimated by minimizing
the time integral of the cost function over paths of trial densities.
Statistical closure of the underresolved dynamics is obtained at the level of
the value function, which equals the optimal cost of reduction with respect to
the resolved variables, and the evolution of the estimated statistical state is
deduced from the Hamilton-Jacobi equation satisfied by the value function. In
the near-equilibrium regime, or under a local quadratic approximation in the
far-from-equilibrium regime, this best-fit closure is governed by a
differential equation for the estimated state vector coupled to a Riccati
differential equation for the Hessian matrix of the value function. Since
memory effects are not explicitly included in the trial densities, a single
adjustable parameter is introduced into the cost function to capture a
time-scale ratio between resolved and unresolved motions. Apart from this
parameter, the closed equations for the resolved variables are completely
determined by the underlying deterministic dynamics.

whether there are some kind of dynamics in irregular fluctuations and if so
whether these dynamics are linear or not, even if this fluctuations are
modulated by long term trends. This situation is theoretically incompatible
with the assumption underlying previously proposed surrogate methods. We apply
the SSS and TFTS methods to microelectrode recording (MER) signals from

Through our methodology we conclude that the irregular fluctuations in MER

interaction between a giant star and a more compact companion. The {\alpha}
parameter describes the fraction of orbital energy released by the companion
that is available to eject the giant star's envelope. By using new, detailed
stellar evolutionary calculations we derive a user-friendly prescription for
the {\lambda} parameter and an improved approximation for the envelope binding
energy, thus revising the {\alpha} equation. We then determine {\alpha} both

gain a deeper understanding of the uncertainties. We find that systems with
very low values of q (the ratio of the companion's mass to the mass of the
primary at the time of the common envelope interaction) have higher values of
{\alpha}. A fit to the data suggests that lower mass companions are left at
comparable or larger orbital separations to more massive companions. We
conjecture that lower mass companions take longer than a stellar dynamical time
to spiral in to the giant's core, and that this is key to allowing the giant to
use its own thermal energy to help unbind its envelope. As a result, although
systems with light companions might not have enough orbital energy to unbind
the common envelope, they might stimulate a stellar reaction that results in
the common envelope ejection.

formulation is presented for the moving boundary problems in the swirl-free
cylindrical coordinates. The governing equations are multiplied with the radial
distance and integrated over arbitrary moving Lagrangian-Eulerian quadrilateral
elements. Therefore, the continuity and the geometric conservation equations
take very simple form similar to those of the Cartesian coordinates. The
continuity equation is satisfied exactly within each element and a special
attention is given to satisfy the geometric conservation law (GCL) at the
discrete level. The equation of motion of a deforming body is solved in
addition to the Navier-Stokes equations in a fully-coupled form. The mesh
deformation is achieved by solving the linear elasticity equation at each time
level while avoiding remeshing in order to enhance numerical robustness. The
resulting algebraic linear systems are solved using an ILU(k) preconditioned
GMRES method provided by the PETSc library. The present ALE method is validated
for the steady and oscillatory flow around a sphere in a cylindrical tube and
applied to the investigation of the flow patterns around a free-swimming
hydromedusa \textit{Aequorea victoria} (crystal jellyfish). The calculations
for the hydromedusa indicate the shed of the opposite signed vortex rings very
close to each other and the formation of large induced velocities along the
line of interaction while the ring vortices moving away from the hydromedusa.

computed and its value is compared with values from the literature for several
other species. The fluid dynamics video presented here shows the time variation
of the instantaneous three-dimensional vorticity isosurfaces around a

dynamical structure and morphologies. We incorporate the feedback into the
dynamical equations through mass dropout and angular momentum transportation
driven by the SNexp-excited turbulent viscosity. We numerically solve the
equations and show that there can be intensive evolution of structure of the
gaseous disk. Secular evolution of the disk shows interesting characteristics
that are 1) high viscosity excited by SNexp can efficiently transport the gas
from 10kpc to $\sim 1$kpc forming a stellar disk whereas a stellar ring forms
for the case with low viscosity; 2) starbursts trigger SMBH activity with a lag
$\sim 10^8$yr depending on star formation rates, prompting the joint evolution
of SMBHs and bulges; 3) the velocity dispersion is as high as $\sim 100~\kms$
in the gaseous disk. In order to compare the present models with the observed
dynamical structure and images, we use the incident continuum from the simple
stellar synthesis (GALAXEV) and CLOUDY to calculate emission line ratios of
H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, $\OIII$ and $\NII$, and H$\alpha$ brightness of gas
photoionized by young massive stars formed on the disks. The models can produce
the main features of emission from star forming galaxies and the observed
relation between turbulent velocity and the H$\alpha$ brightness. We
successfully apply the present model to BX 389 and BX 482 observed in SINS
high$-z$ sample, which are bulge and disk-dominated, respectively. High
viscosity excited by SNexp is able to efficiently transport the gas into a
bulge to maintain high star formation rates, or, to form a stellar ring close
enough to the bulge so that it immigrates into the bulge of its host galaxy.
This leads to a fast growing bulge. Implications and future work of the present
models have been extensively discussed for galaxy formation.

fields in the disk and halo of the Milky Way and the distribution of cosmic-ray
electron density by taking into account the thermal electron density model
NE2001 by Cordes & Lazio (2002, 2003). The models successfully reproduce
observed continuum and polarization all-sky maps and the distribution of
rotation measures of extragalactic sources across the sky. However, the model
parameters obtained for the Galactic halo, although reproducing the
observations, seem physically unreasonable: the magnetic field needs to be
significantly stronger in the Galactic halo than in the plane and the
cosmic-ray distribution must be truncated at about 1 kpc to avoid excessive
synchrotron emission from the halo. The reason for these unrealistic parameters
was the low scale-height of the warm thermal gas of about 1 kpc adapted in the
NE2001 model. However, this scale-height seemed well settled by numerous
investigations. Recently, the scale-height of the warm gas in the Galaxy was
revised by Gaensler et al. (2008) to about 1.8 kpc, by showing that the 1 kpc
scale-height results from a systematic bias in the analysis of pulsar data.
This implies a higher thermal electron density in the Galactic halo, which in
turn reduces the halo magnetic field strength to account for the observed
rotation measures of extragalactic sources. We slightly modified the NE2001
model for the new scale-height and revised the Sun et al. (2008) model
parameters accordingly: the strength of the regular halo magnetic field is now
2 microG or lower, and the physically unrealistic cutoff in z for the
cosmic-ray electron density is removed. The simulations based on the revised
3D-models reproduce all-sky observations as before.

Telescope (E-ELT). It is designed to provide imaging and spectroscopic
capabilities in the 3 - 14 micron region up to a spectral resolution of 100000.
One of the novel concepts of METIS is that of a high-resolution integral field
spectrograph (IFS) for a diffraction-limited mid-IR instrument. While this
concept has many scientific and operational advantages over a long-slit
spectrograph, one drawback is that the spectral resolution changes over the
field of view. This has an impact on the procedures to correct for telluric
absorption lines imprinted on the science spectra. They are a major obstacle in
the quest to maximize spectral fidelity, the ability to distinguish a weak
spectral feature from the continuum. The classical technique of division by a
standard star spectrum, observed in a single IFS spaxel, cannot simply be
applied to all spaxels, because the spectral resolution changes from spaxel to
spaxel. Here we present and discuss possible techniques of telluric line

measurement approach allows a provision for reduction of capital as a result of
insurance mitigation of up to 20%. This paper studies the behaviour of
different insurance policies in the context of capital reduction for a range of
possible extreme loss models and insurance policy scenarios in a multi-period,
multiple risk settings. A Loss Distributional Approach (LDA) for modelling of
the annual loss process, involving homogeneous compound Poisson processes for
the annual losses, with heavy tailed severity models comprised of alpha-stable
severities is considered. There has been little analysis of such models to date
and it is believed, insurance models will play more of a role in OpRisk
mitigation and capital reduction in future. The first question of interest is
when would it be equitable for a bank or financial institution to purchase
insurance for heavy tailed OpRisk losses under different insurance policy
scenarios? The second question then pertains to Solvency II and addresses what
the insurers capital would be for such operational risk scenarios under
different policy offerings. In addition we consider the insurers perspective
with respect to fair premium as a percentage above the expected annual claim
for each insurance policy. The intention being to address questions related to
VaR reduction under Basel II, SCR under Solvency II and fair insurance premiums
in OpRisk for different extreme loss scenarios. In the process we provide
closed form solutions for the distribution of loss process and claims process
in an LDA structure as well as closed form analytic solutions for the Expected
Shortfall, SCR and MCR under Basel II and Solvency II. We also provide closed
form analytic solutions for the annual loss distribution of multiple risks
including insurance mitigation.

Specific heat (CP) and anelastic spectroscopy measurements were performed in
samples of Nd1-xEuxNiO3, 0 <= x <= 0.35. For x = 0, a peak in CP is observed
upon cooling and warming at essentially the same temperature TMI = TN ~ 195 K,
although the cooling peak is much smaller. For x >= 0.25, differences between
cooling and warming curves are negligible, and two well defined peaks are
clearly observed: one at lower temperatures, that define TN, and the other one
at TMI. An external magnetic field of 9 T had no significant effect on these
results. The elastic compliance (s) and the reciprocal of the mechanical
quality factor (Q^-1) of NdNiO3, measured upon warming, showed a very sharp
peak at essentially the same temperature obtained from CP, and no peak is
observed upon cooling. The elastic modulus hardens below TMI much more sharply
upon warming, while the cooling and warming curves are reproducible above TMI.
On the other hand, for the sample with x = 0.35, s and Q^-1 curves are very
similar upon warming and cooling. The results presented here give credence to
the proposition that the MI phase transition changes from first to second order
with increasing Eu doping.

to increase briskly during the cluster development for z<1/2, due to three
factors. First, the accretion rates of gas and dark matter subside, when they
feed on the outer wings of the initial perturbations in the accelerating
Universe. Second, the infall speeds decrease across the progressively shallower
gravitational potential at the shock position. Third, the shocks eventually
weaken, and leave less thermal energy to feed the intracluster entropy, but
relatively more bulk energy to drive turbulence into the outskirts. The overall
outcome from these factors is physically modeled and analytically computed;
thus we ascertain how these concur in setting the equilibrium of the outer
intracluster medium, and predict how the observables in X rays and microwaves
are affected, so as to probe the development of outer turbulence over wide
cluster samples. By the same token, we quantify the resulting negative bias to
be expected in the total mass evaluated from X-ray measurements.

supergiant S Per and the AGB stars IK Tau, RT Vir, U Her and U Ori, to test
maser beaming theory. Spherical clouds are expected to produce an inverse
relationship between maser intensity and apparent size, which would not be seen
from cylindrical or slab-like regions. We analysed the maser properties, in
order to estimate the saturation state, and investigated the variation of
observed spot size with intensity and across the spectral line profiles.
Circumstellar masers emanate from discrete clouds from about one to 20 AU in
diameter depending on the star. Most of the maser features have negative
excitation temperatures close to zero and modest optical depths, showing that
they are mainly unsaturated. Around S Per and (at most epochs) RT Vir and IK
Tau, the maser component size shrinks with increasing intensity. In contrast,
the masers around U Ori and U Her tend to increase in size, with a larger
scatter. The water masers from S Per, RT Vir and IK Tau are mainly beamed into
spots with an observed angular size much smaller than the emitting clouds and
smallest of all at the line peaks. This suggests that the masers are
amplification-bounded, emanating from approximately spherical clouds. Many of
the masers around U Her and U Ori have apparent sizes which are more similar to
the emitting clouds and have less or no dependence on intensity, suggesting
that these masers are matter-bounded. This is consistent with an origin in
flattened clouds and these two stars have shown other behaviour indicating the
presence of shocks.

conundrum which, though in modified form, persists up to this date. Jordan had
an intuitive understanding that the existence of a causal propagation with
finite propagation speed in a quantum theory led to radically different
physical phenomena than those of QM. The conceptional-mathematical
understanding for such an approach began to emerge only 30 years later. The
strongest link between Jordan's view of QFT and modern ""local quantum physics""
is the central role of causal locality as the defining principle of QFT as
opposed to the Born localization in QM. The issue of causal localization is
also the arena where misunderstandings led to a serious derailment of large
part of particle theory e.g. the misinterpretation of an infinite component
pointlike field resulting from the quantization of the Nambu-Goto Lagrangian as
a spacetime quantum string. The new concept of modular localization, which
replaces Jordan's causal locality, is especially important to overcome the
imperfections of gauge theories for which Jordan was the first to note nonlocal
aspects of physical (not Lagrangian) charged fields. Two interesting subjects
in which Jordan was far ahead of his contemporaries will be presented in two

compare the performance of these two PCD families in testing spatial point
patterns. These PCD families are based on relative positions of data points
from two classes and the relative density of the PCDs is used as a statistic
for testing segregation and association against complete spatial randomness.
When scaled properly, the relative density of a PCD is a U-statistic. We extend
the distribution of the relative density of central similarity PCDs for
expansion parameter being larger than one. We compare the asymptotic
distribution of the statistic for the two PCD families, using the standard
central limit theory of U-statistics. We compare finite sample performance of
the tests by Monte Carlo simulations and prove the consistency of the tests
under the alternatives. The asymptotic performance of the tests under the
alternatives is assessed by Pitman's asymptotic efficiency. We find the optimal
expansion parameters of the PCDs for testing each of the segregation and
association alternatives in finite samples and in the limit. We demonstrate
that in terms of empirical power (i.e., for finite samples) relative density of
central similarity PCD has better performance (which occurs for expansion
parameter values larger than one) under segregation alternative, while relative
density of proportional-edge PCD has better performance under association
alternative. The methods are illustrated in a real-life example from plant

flattens out at lower masses. The population of M* = 10^10.2 - 10^10.8 M'
galaxies must have grown significantly between z=0.8 and z=0. We analyze the MF
of different morphological types (ellipticals, S0s and late-types), and find
that also each of them evolves with redshift. All types have proportionally
more massive galaxies at high- than at low-z, and the strongest evolution
occurs among S0 galaxies. Examining the morphology-mass relation (the way the
proportion of galaxies of different morphological types changes with galaxy
mass), we find it strongly depends on redshift. At both redshifts, ~40% of the
stellar mass is in elliptical galaxies. Another ~43% of the mass is in S0
galaxies in local clusters, while it is in spirals in distant clusters. To
explain the observed trends, we discuss the importance of those mechanisms that
could shape the MF. We conclude that mass growth due to star formation plays a
crucial role in driving the evolution. It has to be accompanied by infall of
galaxies onto clusters, and the mass distribution of infalling galaxies might
be different from that of cluster galaxies. However, comparing with high-z
field samples, we do not find conclusive evidence for such an environmental
mass segregation. Our results suggest that star formation and infall change
directly the MF of late-type galaxies in clusters and, indirectly, that of
early-type galaxies through subsequent morphological transformations.

compare the spatial distributions and abundance ratios of HCN, HCO+, and HNC in

based on maps of a 2' (6.6 pc) field at 14"" (0.83 pc) resolution of the J=4-3
transitions of HCN, H13CN, HC15N, HCO+, H13CO+, HC18O+ and HNC. The kinematics
of the molecular gas in W49A appears complex, with a mixture of infall and
outflow motions. Both the line profiles and comparison of the main and rarer
species show that the main species are optically thick. Two 'clumps' of
infalling gas appear to be at ~40 K, compared to ~100 K at the source centre,
and may be ~10x denser than the rest of the outer cloud. Chemical modelling
suggests that the HCN/HNC ratio probes the current gas temperature, while the
HCN/HCO+ ratio and the deuterium fractionation were set during an earlier,
colder phase of evolution. The data suggest that W49A is an appropriate
analogue of an extragalactic star forming region. Our data show that the use of
HCN/HNC/HCO+ line ratios as proxies for the abundance ratios is incorrect for
W49A, suggesting the same for galactic nuclei. Our observed isotopic line
ratios such as H13CN/H13CO+ approach our modeled abundance ratios quite well in

Using a parametric model,we find that the abundance pattern of the
neutron-capture elements could be best explained by a binary system formed in a
molecular cloud, which had been polluted by r-process material. The observed
abundance pattern of C and N can be explained by an AGB model(Karakas &
Lattanzio 2007), . Combing with the parameters obtained from Cui & Zhang
(2006), we suggest that the initial mass of the AGB companion is most likely to
be about 2.5Msun, which excludes the possibility of forming a type-1.5
supernova. By comparing with the observational abundance pattern of CS
22892-052, we find that the dominating production of O should accompany with
the production of the heavy r-process elements of r+s stars. Similar to r-II
stars, the heavy r-process elements are not produced in conjunction with all
the light elements from Na to Fe group. The abundance pattern of the light and
r-process elements for HE 0338-3945 is very close to the pattern of the r-II

$1/|\lambda|^{\nu_1}\ll L\ll 1/|\lambda|^{\nu_2}$, where $\nu_1<\nu_2$ are the

with emergence of quasi-critical points at $\lambda\sim 1/L^{1/\nu_1}$, related
to the proximity to the critical line of finite momentum anisotropic

in 68 galaxies common to the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey and the
Large Galaxy Atlas Survey. Each galaxy was separated into regions of
increasingly red near-infrared colors. In the absence of dust extinction and
other non-stellar emission, stellar populations are shown to have relatively
constant NIR colors, independent of age. In regions of high star formation, the
average intensity of pixels in red-excess regions (at 1.25, 3.6, 4.5, 5.6, 8.0
and 24 micron) scales linearly with the intrinsic intensity of Halpha emission,
and thus with the star-formation rate within the pixel. This suggests that most
NIR-excess regions are not red because their light is being depleted by
absorption. Instead, they are red because additional infrared light is being
contributed by a process linked to star-formation. This is surprising because
the shorter wavelength bands in our study (1.25 micron-5.6 micron) do not probe
emission from cold (10-20 K) and warm (50-100 K) dust associated with
star-formation in molecular clouds. However, emission from hot dust (700-1000
K) and/or Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon molecules can explain the additional
emission seen at the shorter wavelengths in our study. The contribution from
hot dust and/or PAH emission at 2-5micron and PAH emission at 5.6 and 8.0
micron scales linearly with warm dust emission at 24 micron and the intrinsic
Halpha emission. Since both are tied to the star-formation rate, our analysis
shows that the NIR excess continuum emission and PAH emission at ~1-8 micron
can be added to spectral energy distribution models in a very straight-forward
way, by simply adding an additional component to the models that scales
linearly with star-formation rate.

consider single-class classification (SCC) as a two-person game between the
learner and an adversary. In this game the learner has a sample from a target
distribution and the goal is to construct a classifier capable of
distinguishing observations from the target distribution from observations
emitted from an unknown other distribution. The ideal SCC classifier must
guarantee a given tolerance for the false-positive error (false alarm rate)
while minimizing the false negative error (intruder pass rate). Viewing SCC as
a two-person zero-sum game we identify both deterministic and randomized
optimal classification strategies for different game variants. We demonstrate
that randomized classification can provide a significant advantage. In the
deterministic setting we show how to reduce SCC to two-class classification
where in the two-class problem the other class is a synthetically generated
distribution. We provide an efficient and practical algorithm for constructing
and solving the two class problem. The algorithm distinguishes low density
regions of the target distribution and is shown to be consistent.

show evidence of disks and we measure mass accretion rates Macc between
<10^{-11} and few 10^{-9} Msun/yr, using the colors of the diskless stars as
photospheric templates. Our results confirm the dependence of Macc on the mass
of the central object, which is stronger for low-mass stars and flattens out
for masses larger than ~0.3 Msun; the spread of Macc for any value of the
stellar mass is ~2 orders of magnitude. We discuss the implications of these
results in the context of disk evolution models. Finally, we analyze the

due to their ability to characterize spatio-temporal features of biological
structures across the lifespan. Credible models of the correlations in
longitudinal imaging require two or more pattern components. Valid inference
requires enough flexibility of the correlation model to allow reasonable
fidelity to the true pattern. On the other hand, the existence of computable
estimates demands a parsimonious parameterization of the correlation structure.
For many one-dimensional spatial or temporal arrays, the linear exponent
autoregressive (LEAR) correlation structure meets these two opposing goals in
one model. The LEAR structure is a flexible two-parameter correlation model
that applies in situations in which the within-subject correlation decreases
exponentially in time or space. It allows for an attenuation or acceleration of
the exponential decay rate imposed by the commonly used continuous-time AR(1)
structure. Here we propose the Kronecker product LEAR correlation structure for
multivariate repeated measures data in which the correlation between
measurements for a given subject is induced by two factors. We also provide a
scientifically informed approach to assessing the adequacy of a Kronecker
product LEAR model and a general unstructured Kronecker product model. The
approach provides useful guidance for high dimension, low sample size data that
preclude using standard likelihood based tests. Longitudinal medical imaging
data of caudate morphology in schizophrenia illustrates the appeal of the
Kronecker product LEAR correlation structure.

proposed by Bianchi for modeling single cell WLANs consisting of saturated
nodes. In this paper, we provide a new approach to model the situation when the
nodes are not saturated. We study a State Dependent Attempt Rate (SDAR)
approximation to model $M$ queues (one queue per node) served by the CSMA/CA
protocol as standardized in the IEEE 802.11 DCF MAC protocol. The approximation
is that, when $n$ of the $M$ queues are non-empty, the transmission attempt
probability of the $n$ non-empty nodes is given by the long-term transmission
attempt probability of $n$ ""saturated"" nodes as provided by Bianchi's model.
The SDAR approximation reduces a single cell WLAN with non-saturated nodes to a
""coupled queue system"". When packets arrive to the $M$ queues according to
independent Poisson processes, we provide a Markov model for the coupled queue
system with SDAR service. \textit{The main contribution of this paper is to
provide an analysis of the coupled queue process by studying a lower
dimensional process, and by introducing a certain conditional independence
approximation}. We show that the SDAR model of contention provides an accurate
model for the DCF MAC protocol in single cells, and report the simulation
speed-ups thus obtained by our \textit{model-based simulation}.

the quadratic corrections are dual to long perturbative series. In the dual

tree-level muon Yukawa coupling the lightest smuon mass is predicted to be in
the range between 750 GeV and 2700 GeV at 2 sigma, if the bino mass M_1 is
below 1 TeV. Therefore, a detection of a smuon (in conjunction with a sub-TeV
bino) at the LHC would directly imply a non-zero muon Yukawa coupling in the
MSSM superpotential. Inclusion of slepton flavor mixing could in principle
lower the mass of one smuon-like slepton below 750 GeV. However, the
experimental bounds on radiative lepton decays instead strengthen the lower
mass bound, with larger effects for smaller M_1, We also extend the analysis to

21-cm signal from z=1.32. The multi-frequency angular power spectrum C_l(Delta
nu) is used to characterize the statistical properties of the background
radiation across angular scales ~20"" to 10', and a frequency bandwidth of 7.5
MHz with resolution 125 kHz. The measured C_l(Delta nu) which ranges from 7
mK^2 to 18 mK^2 is dominated by foregrounds, the expected HI signal
C_l^HI(Delta nu) ~10^{-6}- 10^{-7} mK^2 is several orders of magnitude smaller.
The foregrounds, believed to originate from continuum sources, is expected to
vary smoothly with Delta nu whereas the HI signal decorrelates within ~0.5 MHz
and this holds the promise of separating the two. For each l, we use the
interval 0.5 < Delta nu < 7.5 MHz to fit a fourth order polynomial which is
subtracted from the measured C_l(Delta nu) to remove any smoothly varying
component across the entire bandwidth Delta nu < 7.5 MHz. The residual
C_l(Delta nu), we find, has an oscillatory pattern with amplitude and period
respectively ~0.1 mK^2 and Delta nu = 3 MHz at the smallest l value of 1476,
and the amplitude and period decreasing with increasing l. Applying a suitably
chosen high pass filter, we are able to remove the residual oscillatory pattern
for l=1476 where the residual C_l(Delta nu) is now consistent with zero at the
3-sigma noise level. We conclude that we have successfully removed the
foregrounds at l=1476 and the residuals are consistent with noise. We use this
to place an upper limit on the HI signal whose amplitude is determined by x_HI
b where x_HI and b are the HI neutral fraction and the HI bias respectively. A
value of x_HI b greater than 7.95 would have been detected in our observation,
and is therefore ruled out at the 3-sigma level. (abridged)

the need for confirmatory higher-resolution spectroscopy. Our initial study has

numerical tests of an SGS turbulence energy model that predicts the turbulent

highly compressible turbulence. We test closures for the turbulence energy
cascade by filtering data from high-resolution simulations of forced isothermal
and adiabatic turbulence. Optimal properties and an excellent correlation are
found for a linear combination of the eddy-viscosity closure that is employed
in LES of weakly compressible turbulence and a term that is non-linear in the
Jacobian matrix of the velocity. Using this mixed closure, the SGS turbulence
energy model is validated in LES of turbulence with stochastic forcing. It is
found that the SGS model satisfies several important requirements: 1. The mean
SGS turbulence energy follows a power law for varying grid scale. 2. The root
mean square (RMS) Mach number of the unresolved velocity fluctuations is
proportional to the RMS Mach number of the resolved turbulence, independent of
the forcing. 3. The rate of dissipation and the turbulence energy flux are
constant. Moreover, we discuss difficulties with direct estimates of the
turbulent pressure and the dissipation rate on the basis of resolved flow
quantities that have recently been proposed. In combination with the energy
injection by stellar feedback and other unresolved processes, the proposed SGS
model is applicable to a variety of problems in computational astrophysics.
Computing the SGS turbulence energy, the treatment of star formation and
stellar feedback in galaxy simulations can be improved. Further, we expect that
the turbulent pressure on the grid scale affects the stability of gas against

two-parametric family of two-connected abelian Lie groups is obtained. The
necessity of existence of so-called imaginary charges and electromagnetic
fields with negative energy density (dark photons) is derived. The
possibilities when the overall Lagrangian represents a sum or difference of two
identical Lagrangians for the visible and hidden sectors (i.e. copies of
unbroken) are ruled out by the extended symmetry. The distinction between the
two types of fields resides in the fact that for one of them current and
electromagnetic kinetic terms in Lagrangians are identical in sign, whereas for
another type these terms are opposite in sign. As a consequence, and in
contrast to the common case, like imaginary charges attract and unlike charges
repel. Some cosmological issues of the proposed hypothesis are discussed.
Particles carrying imaginary charges (""allotons"") are proposed as dark matter
candidates. Such a matter would be imaginary charged on a large scale for the
reason that dark atoms would carry non-compensated charges. Consequently, there
exist (dark) electromagnetic fields with negative energy density on
cosmological scales (the reviving of the idea of Faradayan cosmology). This
leads to the hypothesis that the modern state of the Universe is
radiation-dominated by dark photons with negative energy density that is the
source of the observed late-time cosmological acceleration. This provides an
explanation for the small value of the cosmological constant as a renormalized
vacuum energy.

giving rise to a large spectrum of magnetoresistance oscillations. To explain
these observations, recent models put forward that, as edge states come close
to each other, electrons can hop between counterpropagating edge channels, or
tunnel through Coulomb islands. Here, we use scanning gate microscopy to
demonstrate the presence of quantum Hall Coulomb islands, and reveal the
spatial structure of transport inside a quantum Hall interferometer. Electron
islands locations are found by modulating the tunneling between edge states and
confined electron orbits. Tuning the magnetic field, we unveil a continuous

high magnetic field magnetoresistance oscillations, and opens the way to
further local scale manipulations of quantum Hall localized states.

For a high density of dependency links the network disintegrates in a form of a
first order phase transition while for a low density of dependency links the

stations present a great potential for deployment in next-generation wireless

within robotics or software applications, we propose a novel usage model for
self-organizing agents suited to wireless networks. In the proposed model, a
number of agents are required to collect data from several arbitrarily located
tasks. Each task represents a queue of packets that require collection and
subsequent wireless transmission by the agents to a central receiver. The
problem is modeled as a hedonic coalition formation game between the agents and
the tasks that interact in order to form disjoint coalitions. Each formed
coalition is modeled as a polling system consisting of a number of agents which
move between the different tasks present in the coalition, collect and transmit
the packets. Within each coalition, some agents can also take the role of a
relay for improving the packet success rate of the transmission. The proposed
algorithm allows the tasks and the agents to take distributed decisions to join
or leave a coalition, based on the achieved benefit in terms of effective
throughput, and the cost in terms of delay. As a result of these decisions, the
agents and tasks structure themselves into independent disjoint coalitions
which constitute a Nash-stable network partition. Moreover, the proposed
algorithm allows the agents and tasks to adapt the topology to environmental
changes such as the arrival/removal of tasks or the mobility of the tasks.
Simulation results show how the proposed algorithm improves the performance, in
terms of average player (agent or task) payoff, of at least 30.26% (for a
network of 5 agents with up to 25 tasks) relatively to a scheme that allocates
nearby tasks equally among agents.

network structure and the cooperative incentives of the SUs that seek to
cooperate for improving their detection performance. We model the CSS problem
as a non-transferable coalitional game, and we propose distributed algorithms

with a coalitional voting game for enabling distributed coalition formation

(RIXS) at the O $K$ edge in undoped cuprates by taking La_{2}CuO_{4} as a
benchmark case, based on a series of RIXS measurements that we present here. By
combining the experimental results with basic theory we point out the
fingerprints of bimagnon in the O $K$ edge RIXS spectra. These are a dominant
peak around 450 meV, the almost complete absence of dispersion both with $\pi$
and $\sigma$ polarization and the almost constant intensity vs. the transferred
momentum with $\sigma$ polarization. This behavior is quite different from Cu
$L_3$ edge RIXS giving a strongly dispersing bimagnon tending to zero at the
center of the Brillouin zone. This is clearly shown by RIXS measurements at the
Cu $L_3$ edge that we present. The Cu $L_3$ bimagnon spectra and those at Cu
$K$ edge - both from the literature and from our data - however, have the same
shape. These similarities and differences are understood in terms of different
sampling of the bimagnon continuum. This panorama points out the unique
possibilities offered by O $K$ RIXS in the study of magnetic excitations in
cuprates near the center of the BZ.

instead of the single version we perceive, with the perceived version chosen at
random according to a probability law. Because of these peculiarities, the
theory requires an interpretation to be fully understood. Over 50 years ago,
Everett proposed in his many-worlds interpretation that these characteristics
could be accounted for if the mathematics itself, with no collapse or hidden
variables, was carefully analyzed. We show this is incorrect; the linear
mathematics cannot account for the probability law. Thus the many-worlds
interpretation is not viable. Some mechanism, such as collapse or hidden
variables, must be added to obtain a satisfactory understanding of the physical
universe.

solution to a parabolic partial differential inequality; this is determined

intimately related to properties of strict local martingales and is used to

Some extensions to non-Markovian situations are also presented.

optimal dividend strategy is not barrier and the optimal value function is not
twice continuously differentiable.

either by stochastic control or by martingale methods. Beginning with the
seminal paper of Davis and Norman [Math. Oper. Res. 15 (1990) 676--713],
stochastic control theory has also been used to solve various problems of this
type in the presence of proportional transaction costs. Martingale methods, on
the other hand, have so far only been used to derive general structural
results. These apply the duality theory for frictionless markets typically to a
fictitious shadow price process lying within the bid-ask bounds of the real
price process. In this paper, we show that this dual approach can actually be
used for both deriving a candidate solution and verification in Merton's
problem with logarithmic utility and proportional transaction costs. In
particular, we determine the shadow price process.
