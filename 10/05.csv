We compute the envelope-structure parameter {\lambda_\mathrm{env}} from the

made in population-synthesis codes. We conclude that {\lambda_\mathrm{env}}
varies appreciably and that the assumption of a constant value for this

may well result in the implicit assumption of unintended and/or unphysical

oversimplified assumptions for {\lambda_\mathrm{env}}, and the use of

polarization anisotropies in the CMB. These originate from tensor fluctuations
of the metric produced during the inflationary phase. Their detection would
therefore constitute a major step towards understanding the primordial
Universe. The expected level of these anisotropies is however so small that it
requires a new generation of instruments with high sensitivity and extremely
good control of systematic effects. We propose the QUBIC instrument based on
the novel concept of bolometric interferometry, bringing together the
sensitivity advantages of bolometric detectors with the systematics effects
advantages of interferometry. Methods: The instrument will directly observe the
sky through an array of entry horns whose signals will be combined together
using an optical combiner. The whole set-up is located inside a cryostat.
Polarization modulation will be achieved using a rotating half-wave plate and
interference fringes will be imaged on two focal planes (separated by a
polarizing grid) tiled with bolometers. We show that QUBIC can be considered as
a synthetic imager, exactly similar to a usual imager but with a synthesized
beam formed by the array of entry horns. Scanning the sky provides an
additional modulation of the signal and improve the sky coverage shape. The
usual techniques of map-making and power spectrum estimation can then be
applied. We show that the sensitivity of such an instrument is comparable with
that of an imager with the same number of horns. We anticipate a low level of
beam-related systematics thanks to the fact that the synthesized beam is
determined by the location of the primary horns. Other systematics should be
under good control thanks to an autocalibration technique, specific to our
concept, that will permit the accurate determination of most of the systematics
parameters.

outbursts. These recent AGN outbursts have produced many small X-ray cavities,
cool filaments and cold fronts. We find a correlation between the coolest X-ray
emitting gas and the morphology of the Ha filaments. The Ha filaments are
oriented in the direction of the X-ray cavities, suggesting that the warm gas
responsible for the Halpha emission originated near the center of NGC 5044 and
was dredged up behind the buoyant, AGN-inflated X-ray cavities. A detailed
spectroscopic analysis shows that the central region of NGC 5044 contains
spatially varying amounts of multiphase gas. The regions with the most
inhomogeneous gas temperature distribution tend to correlate with the extended
235 MHz and 610 MHz radio emission detected by the GMRT. This may result from
gas entrainment within the radio emitting plasma or mixing of different
temperature gas in the regions surrounding the radio emitting plasma by AGN
induced turbulence. Accounting for the effects of multiphase gas, we find that
the abundance of heavy elements is fairly uniform within the central 100 kpc,
with abundances of 60-80% solar for all elements except oxygen, which has a
significantly sub-solar abundance. In the absence of continued AGN outbursts,
the gas in the center of NGC 5044 should attain a more homogeneous distribution
of gas temperature through the dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy and heat
conduction in approximately 10e8 yr. The presence of multiphase gas in NGC 5044
indicates that the time between recent AGN outbursts has been less than

regarded as scaled-up X-ray binaries (XRB). The timescales of the evolutionary
phenomena in these two classes are proportional to the black hole (BH) masses.
Consequently, unlike in the case of XRBs, the evolution of AGNs is too slow to
be followed directly. What could be done, however, is to assign particular
types of active galaxies to different evolutionary stages observable in XRBs.
We studied such an assignment for three quasars with clear signatures of a
recent transition from the radio-loud to the radio-quiet state. The quasars we
investigated have large-scale radio lobes that are clearly asymmetric -- one
lobe is of Fanaroff-Riley II type, while the other one is a diffuse relic
devoid of a hotspot. We suggest that the prime cause of the asymmetry of these
radio sources is that the nuclei of their host galaxies currently produce no
jets. To prove that, we observed them with milliarcsecond resolution to check
if they are similar to those in radio-quiet quasars. The observations carried
out with the EVN revealed that the nuclei of the quasars under investigation
are not of a core-jet type that is characteristic for radio-loud,
lobe-dominated quasars. It follows that the lobes are no longer fuelled and
that the apparent asymmetry results from the orientation, which causes a time
lag of the order of 10^6 years between their images: the lobe perceived as a
relic is nearer than the lobe with a hotspot and so it is observed in a later
stage of the decay. The three AGNs under investigation were radio-loud earlier,
but now they have switched to the radio-quiet state. In the framework of the
XRB/AGN unification, the above means that they have left the very high state
and have moved now to the high/soft state. (abridged)

constant coefficients Poisson problems that allows the use of standard ""black
box"" solvers, without compromising accuracy. The basic idea of the new approach
is similar to the Ghost Fluid Method (GFM). The GFM relies on corrections
applied on nodes located across the interface for discretization stencils that
straddle the interface. If the corrections are solution-independent, they can
be moved to the right-hand-side (RHS) of the equations, producing a problem
with the same linear system as if there were no jumps, only with a different
RHS. However, achieving high accuracy is very hard (if not impossible) with the
""standard"" approaches used to compute the GFM correction terms.
  In this paper we generalize the GFM correction terms to a correction
function, defined on a band around the interface. This function is then shown
to be characterized as the solution to a PDE, with appropriate boundary
conditions. This PDE can, in principle, be solved to any desired order of
accuracy. As an example, we apply this new method to devise a 4th order
accurate scheme for the constant coefficients Poisson equation with
discontinuities in 2D. This scheme is based on (i) the standard 9-point stencil
discretization of the Poisson equation, (ii) a representation of the correction
function in terms of bicubics, and (iii) a solution of the correction function
PDE by a least squares minimization. Several applications of the method are
presented to illustrate its robustness dealing with a variety of interface
geometries, its capability to capture sharp discontinuities, and its high
convergence rate.

redshift z=2.73 that has a star-formation rate (SFR) of 270 solar-mass/year
(derived from optical and near-infrared spectroscopy). Taking the magnification
of the system ~12 and the SFR into account, the expected flux density of any
associated radio emission at 1.4 GHz is predicted to be just 0.1 mJy. However,
the lens system is found to be coincident with a radio source detected in the
NRAO Very Large Array (VLA) Sky Survey with a flux density of ~5 mJy. If this
flux density is attributed to the lensed LBG then it would imply a SFR ~11000
solar-mass/year, in contrast with the optical and near-infrared derived value.
We want to investigate the radio properties of this system, and independently
determine the SFR for the LBG from its lensed radio emission. We have carried
out new high resolution imaging with the VLA ain A and B-configurations at 1.4

associated with the lensing galaxy. The radio-jet from the AGN partially covers
the lensed arc of the LBG, and we do not detect any radio emission from the
unobscured region of the arc down to a 3 sigma flux-density limit of 108
micro-Jy/beam. Using the radio data, we place a limit of <750 solar-mass/year

VLA will be sufficient to detect many high redshift LBGs that are
gravitationally lensed after only a few hours of observing time. The high

with HST NICMOS-3. We study detections at submm Herschel bands, together with
Spitzer 24{\mu}m data, as a function of the morphological type, mass and size.
We find that 26/45 sources are detected at MIPS-24{\mu}m and 15/45 (all
MIPS-24{\mu}m detections) are detected at SPIRE-250{\mu}m, with disk-like
galaxies more easily detected. We derive star formation rates (SFR) and
specific star formation rates (sSFR) by fitting the spectral energy
distribution (SED) of our sources, taking into account non-detections for SPIRE
and systematic effects for MIPS derived quantities. We find that the mean SFR
for the spheroidal galaxies (50-100 Msun*yr^-1) is substantially (a factor ~ 3)
lower than the mean value presented by disk-like galaxies (250-300 Msun*yr^-1).

neutron star kicks. Here, we present a two-dimensional, radiation-hydrodynamic

fully-formed, nascent neutron star (NS) via an induced, neutrino-driven
explosion. During the explosion, a ~10% anisotropy in the low-mass,
high-velocity ejecta lead to recoil of the high-mass neutron star. At the end
of our simulation, the NS has achieved a velocity of ~150 km s$^{-1}$ and is
accelerating at ~350 km s$^{-2}$, but has yet to reach the ballistic regime.
The recoil is due almost entirely to hydrodynamical processes, with anisotropic
neutrino emission contributing less than 2% to the overall kick magnitude.
Since the observed distribution of neutron star kick velocities peaks at
~300-400 km s$^{-1}$, recoil due to anisotropic core-collapse supernovae
provides a natural, non-exotic mechanism with which to obtain neutron star
kicks.

higher luminosity surface density. We also find a good correlation between the
IR luminosity and IR luminosity surface density in starburst galaxies across
over five orders of magnitude of IR luminosity from local normal galaxies to z
~ 2 SMGs. The intensely star-forming regions of local ULIRGs are significantly
smaller than those in their high-redshift counterparts and hence diverge
significantly from this correlation, indicating that the ULIRGs found locally
are a different population from the high-redshift ULIRGs and SMGs. Based on
this relationship, we suggest that luminosity surface density should serve as a
more accurate indicator for the IR emitting environment, and hence the
observable properties, of star-forming galaxies than their IR luminosity. We
demonstrate this approach by showing that ULIRGs at z ~ 1 and a lensed galaxy
at z ~ 2.5 exhibit aromatic features agreeing with local LIRGs that are an
order of magnitude less luminous, but have similar IR luminosity surface
density. A consequence of this relationship is that the aromatic emission

regions"" that should correspond to regions of stellar mass density
enhancements. The two grand-design spirals show a clear two-armed structure,
while NGC 6946 is more complex. We examine these arm and interarm regions,
looking at maps that trace recent star formation - far-ultraviolet (GALEX NGS)
and 24 micron emission (Spitzer, SINGS) - and cold gas - CO (Heracles) and HI
(Things). We find the star formation tracers and CO more concentrated in the
spiral arms than the stellar 3.6 micron flux. If we define the spiral arms as
the 25% highest pixels in the filtered 3.6 micron images, we find that the
majority (60%) of star formation tracers occurs in the interarm regions; this
result persists qualitatively even when considering the potential impact of
finite data resolution and diffuse interarm 24 micron emission. Even with a
generous definition of the arms (45% highest pixels), interarm regions still
contribute at least 30% to the integrated star formation rate tracers. We look
for evidence that spiral arms trigger star or cloud formation using the ratios
of star formation rate (SFR, traced by a combination of FUV and 24 micron
emission) to H_2 (traced by CO) and H_2 to HI. Any enhancement of SFR / M(H_2)
in the arm region is very small (less than 10%) and the grand design spirals
show no enhancement compared to the flocculent target. Arm regions do show a
weak enhancement in H_2/HI compared to the interarm regions, but at a fixed gas
surface density there is little clear enhancement in the H_2/HI ratio in the
arm regions. Thus, it seems that spiral arms may only act to concentrate the
gas to higher densities in the arms.

M31 could have experienced a major merger in its past history. It results that
a 3+/-0.5:1 gaseous rich merger with r(per)=25+/-5 kpc and a polar orbit can
explain many properties of M31 and of its halo. The interaction and the fusion
may have begun 8.75+/-0.35 Gyr and 5.5 +/-0.5 Gyr ago, respectively. With an
almost quiescent star formation history before the fusion we retrieve fractions
of bulge, thin and thick disks as well as relative fractions of intermediate
age and old stars in both the thick disk and the Giant Stream. The Giant Stream
is caused by returning stars from a tidal tail previously stripped from the
satellite prior to the fusion. These returning stars are trapped into
elliptical orbits or loops for almost a Hubble time period. Large loops are
also predicted and they scale rather well with the recently discovered features
in the M31 outskirts. We demonstrate that a single merger could explain
first-order (intensity and size), morphological and kinematical properties of
the disk, thick disk, bulge and streams in the halo of M31, as well as the
distribution of stellar ages, and perhaps metallicities. It challenges
scenarios assuming one minor merger per feature in the disk (10 kpc ring) or at
the outskirts (numerous streams & thick disk). Further constraints will help to
properly evaluate the impact of such a major event to the Local Group.

trigger particle are sensitive to the properties of the nuclear medium created
at RHIC through the strong interactions occurring between the traversing parton
and the medium, i.e. jet-quenching. Previous measurements revealed a strong
modification to dihadron azimuthal correlations in Au+Au collisions with
respect to p+p and d+Au collisions. The modification increases with the
collision centrality, suggesting a path-length or energy density dependence to
the jet-quenching effect. This paper reports STAR measurements of dihadron
azimuthal correlations in mid-central (20-60%) Au+Au collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{_{\rm NN}}}=200$ GeV as a function of the trigger particle's
azimuthal angle relative to the event plane, $\phi_s=|\phi_t-\psi_{\rm EP}|$.
The azimuthal correlation is studied as a function of both the trigger and
associated particle $p_T$. The subtractions of the combinatorial background and
anisotropic flow, assuming Zero Yield At Minimum (ZYAM), are described. The
correlation results are first discussed with subtraction of the even harmonic
(elliptic and quadrangular) flow backgrounds. The away-side correlation is
strongly modified, and the modification varies with $\phi_s$, with a
double-peak structure for out-of-plane trigger particles. The near-side ridge
(long range pseudo-rapidity $\Delta\eta$ correlation) appears to drop with
increasing $\phi_s$ while the jet-like component remains approximately
constant. The correlation functions are further studied with subtraction of odd
harmonic triangular flow background arising from fluctuations. It is found that
the triangular flow, while responsible for the majority of the amplitudes, is
not sufficient to explain the $\phi_s$-dependence of the ridge or the away-side
double-peak structure. ...

weights leverage side information, either in data associated with comparisons

which displays power law behavior at small wavevectors reminiscent of a
critical state, and a change in this power law from real to complex that is

noisy data. Typically, it is implemented by adding some sort of norm constraint
to an objective function and then exactly optimizing the modified objective
function. This procedure often leads to optimization problems that are
computationally more expensive than the original problem, a fact that is
clearly problematic if one is interested in large-scale applications. On the
other hand, a large body of empirical work has demonstrated that heuristics,
and in some cases approximation algorithms, developed to speed up computations
sometimes have the side-effect of performing regularization implicitly. Thus,
we consider the question: What is the regularized optimization objective that
an approximation algorithm is exactly optimizing?
  We address this question in the context of computing approximations to the
smallest nontrivial eigenvector of a graph Laplacian; and we consider three
random-walk-based procedures: one based on the heat kernel of the graph, one
based on computing the the PageRank vector associated with the graph, and one
based on a truncated lazy random walk. In each case, we provide a precise
characterization of the manner in which the approximation method can be viewed
as implicitly computing the exact solution to a regularized problem.
Interestingly, the regularization is not on the usual vector form of the
optimization problem, but instead it is on a related semidefinite program.

generates multiple reflected shocks. The typical Mach numbers of the reflected
shocks are shown to be M ~ 2 depending on the density contrast between the
diffuse intercloud gas and clouds. These secondary shocks can further energize
cosmic-ray particles originally accelerated at the blast-wave shock. This

predicts the high-energy spectral index ranging approximately from 3 to 4.

to a sharp first-order like congestion transition. We also consider the case

isometrically isomorphic if and only if the defining polynomial relations are
the same up to a unitary change of variables, and that this happens if and only
if the associated subproduct systems are isomorphic. The proof makes use of the
complex analytic structure of the character space, together with some recent
results on subproduct systems. Restricting attention to commutative operator
algebras defined by radical relations yields strong resemblances with classical
algebraic geometry. These commutative operator algebras turn out to be algebras
of analytic functions on algebraic varieties. We prove a projective
Nullstellensatz connecting closed ideals and their zero sets. Under some
technical assumptions, we find that two such algebras are isomorphic as
algebras if and only if they are similar, and we obtain a clear geometrical
picture of when this happens. This result is obtained with tools from algebraic
geometry, reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, and some new complex-geometric
rigidity results of independent interest. The C*-envelopes of these algebras
are also determined. The Banach-algebraic and the algebraic classification
results are shown to hold for the weak-operator closures of these algebras as

concentration range $0.015\leq c \leq 8$~mM (bp) were complemented by
fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) measurements of the DNA polyion
diffusion coefficient $D_p(c)$. We observed a crossover in the normalized
conductivity $\sigma(c)/c$ which nearly halved across $c=0.05-1$ mM range,
while $D_p(c)$ remained rather constant, as we established by FCS. Analyzing
these data we extracted $\theta(c)=0.30 - 0.45$, and taking the Manning
asymmetry field effect on polyelectrolyte conductivity into account we got
$\theta(c)=0.40-0.60$. We relate the $\theta(c)$ variation to gradual DNA
denaturation occuring, in the very low salt environment, with the decrease in
DNA concentration itself. The extremes of the experimental $\theta(c)$ range
occur towards the highest, above 1 mM and the lowest, below 0.05 mM, DNA

cluster-cluster correlation functions) and stacked weak lensing signals of
background galaxy shapes, both of which are available in a wide-field optical
imaging survey. Assuming that the clusters have secure redshift estimates, we
show that the joint experiment enables a self-calibration of important
systematic errors including the source redshift uncertainty and the cluster
mass-observable relation, by adopting a single population of background source
galaxies for the lensing analysis. It allows us to use the relative strengths
of stacked lensing signals at different cluster redshifts for calibrating the
source redshift uncertainty, which in turn leads to accurate measurements of
the mean cluster mass in each bin. In addition, our formulation of stacked
lensing signals in Fourier space simplifies the Fisher matrix calculations, as
well as the marginalization over the cluster off-centering effect, the most
significant uncertainty in stacked lensing. We show that upcoming wide-field
surveys yield stringent constraints on cosmological parameters including dark
energy parameters, without any priors on nuisance parameters that model
systematic uncertainties. Specifically, the stacked lensing information
improves the dark energy FoM by a factor of 4, compared to that from the
cluster observables alone. The primordial non-Gaussianity parameter can also be
constrained with a level of f_NL~10. In this method, the mean source redshift
is well calibrated to an accuracy of 0.1 in redshift, and the mean cluster mass
in each bin to 5-10% accuracies, which demonstrates the success of the
self-calibration of systematic uncertainties from the joint experiment.

the molecular cloud and finally triggered the recent star formation in the

possess an m=1 inner Lindblad resonance with no Newtonian Keplerian analogue;
however its strength is very weak even in the moderately relativistic regime

leading contributions to the resonant amplitude (the gravitoelectric octupole
and gravitomagnetic quadrupole). For equatorial orbits around Kerr black holes,
we find that the m=1 ILR strength is enhanced for retrograde spins and
suppressed for prograde spins. We also find that the torque associated with the
m>=2 inner Lindblad resonances is enhanced relative to the nonrelativistic
case; the enhancement is a factor of 2 for the Schwarzschild hole even when the

dual linear systems. Besides having to store only few Lanczos vectors, using
the BiConjugate Gradient method (BiCG) to solve dual linear systems has
advantages for specific applications. For example, using BiCG to solve the dual
linear systems arising in interpolatory model reduction provides a backward
error formulation in the model reduction framework. Using BiCG to evaluate
bilinear forms -- for example, in quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods for
electronic structure calculations -- leads to a quadratic error bound. Since
our focus is on sequences of dual linear systems, we introduce recycling BiCG,
a BiCG method that recycles two Krylov subspaces from one pair of dual linear
systems to the next pair. The derivation of recycling BiCG also builds the
foundation for developing recycling variants of other bi-Lanczos based methods,
such as CGS, BiCGSTAB, QMR, and TFQMR.
  We develop an augmented bi-Lanczos algorithm and a modified two-term
recurrence to include recycling in the iteration. The recycle spaces are
approximate left and right invariant subspaces corresponding to the eigenvalues
closest to the origin. These recycle spaces are found by solving a small
generalized eigenvalue problem alongside the dual linear systems being solved
in the sequence.
  We test our algorithm in two application areas. First, we solve a discretized
partial differential equation (PDE) of convection-diffusion type. Such a
problem provides well-known test cases that are easy to test and analyze
further. Second, we use recycling BiCG in the Iterative Rational Krylov
Algorithm (IRKA) for interpolatory model reduction. IRKA requires solving
sequences of slowly changing dual linear systems. We show up to 70% savings in
iterations, and also demonstrate that for a model reduction problem BiCG takes
(about) 50% more time than recycling BiCG.

of positive and unlabeled examples, both in the inductive and in the
transductive setting. This problem, often referred to as \emph{PU learning},
differs from the standard supervised classification problem by the lack of
negative examples in the training set. It corresponds to an ubiquitous
situation in many applications such as information retrieval or gene ranking,
when we have identified a set of data of interest sharing a particular
property, and we wish to automatically retrieve additional data sharing the
same property among a large and easily available pool of unlabeled data. We
propose a conceptually simple method, akin to bagging, to approach both
inductive and transductive PU learning problems, by converting them into series
of supervised binary classification problems discriminating the known positive
examples from random subsamples of the unlabeled set. We empirically
demonstrate the relevance of the method on simulated and real data, where it
performs at least as well as existing methods while being faster.

energy input rates are based on the initial mass function (IMF) of the observed
OB association inside the superbubble. Results: The analysis of the spectra
shows that the soft X-ray emission arises from hot shocked gas surrounded by a

consists in taking into account the temporal dependence of these functional
observations. Examples include daily curves of financial transaction data and
daily patterns of geophysical and environmental data. For scalar and vector
valued stochastic processes, a large number of dependence notions have been
proposed, mostly involving mixing type distances between $\sigma$-algebras. In

that it is applicable to linear as well as nonlinear functional time series.
Then we investigate the impact of dependence thus quantified on several
important statistical procedures for functional data. We study the estimation

may be instantaneous or described by a power-law time dependence, starting from
the equilibrium ground state for a initial trap size. Renormalization-group
scaling arguments, analytical and numerical calculations show that the

cast in the form of a trap-size scaling in the low-density regime,
characterized by universal power laws of the trap size, in dilute gases with
repulsive contact interactions and lattice systems described by the

hot and cold doses at the field junction within the target. Such uncertainties
will also cause cold doses in the peripheral region of the target. We have
developed an algorithm to reduce the sensitivity of the dual-field plan to
these uncertainties in scanning irradiations. This algorithm is composed of the
following two steps: 1) generating the expanded target volume, and 2) solving
the inverse problem where the terms suppressing the dose gradient of individual
fields are added into the objective function. The validity of this algorithm is
demonstrated through the simulation studies for three extreme cases of two
fields with unidirectional, opposing and orthogonal geometries. With the
proposed algorithm, we can obtain a more robust plan to minimize the effects of
range and setup uncertainties than the conventional plan. Compared to that for
the conventional plan, the optimization time for the robust plan increased by a
factor of approximately three.

$G$-bivariant analog of a commutative (semi-)group. In this view, a
$G$-bivariant analog of a (semi-)ring should be a (semi-)Tambara functor. A
Tambara functor is firstly defined by Tambara, which he called a TNR-functor,
when $G$ is finite. As shown by Brun, a Tambara functor plays a natural role in
the Witt-Burnside construction.
  It will be a natural question if there exist sufficiently many examples of
Tambara functors, compared to the wide range of Mackey functors. In the first
part of this article, we give a general construction of a Tambara functor from
any Mackey functor, on an arbitrary group $G$. In fact, we construct a functor
from the category of semi-Mackey functors to the category of Tambara functors.
This functor gives a left adjoint to the forgetful functor, and can be regarded
as a $G$-bivariant analog of the monoid-ring functor.

from the applications of quantum entanglement in quantum information to the
applications of nonequilibrium bulk and interface phenomena in microfluidics,
biology, materials science, energy engineering, etc. --- require understanding
thermodynamic entropy beyond the equilibrium realm of its traditional
definition. This paper presents a rigorous logical scheme that provides a
generalized definition of entropy free of the usual unnecessary assumptions
which constrain the theory to the equilibrium domain. The scheme is based on
carefully worded operative definitions for all the fundamental concepts
employed, including those of system, property, state, isolated system,
environment, process, separable system, system uncorrelated from its
environment, and parameters of a system. The treatment considers also systems
with movable internal walls and/or semipermeable walls, with chemical reactions
and/or external force fields, and with small numbers of particles. The
definition of reversible process is revised by introducing the new concept of
scenario. The definition of entropy involves neither the concept of heat nor
that of quasistatic process; it applies to both equilibrium and nonequilibrium
states. The role of correlations on the domain of definition and on the
additivity of energy and entropy is discussed: it is proved that energy is
defined and additive for all separable systems, while entropy is defined and
additive only for separable systems uncorrelated from their environment;
decorrelation entropy is defined. The definitions of energy and entropy are
extended rigorously to open systems. Finally, to complete the discussion, the
existence of the fundamental relation for stable equilibrium states is proved,
in our context, for both closed and open systems.

We shall show that several of those diagrams cancel against each other due to a

The same supersymmetry allows the introduction of super-fields and

dispersal of viscously evolving T-Tauri discs. We show that the X-ray
photoevaporation wind rates scale linearly with X-ray luminosity, such that the
observed range of X-ray luminosities for solar-type T-Tauri stars (10e28-10e31
erg\s) gives rise to vigorous disc winds with rates of order 10e-10-10e-7
M_sun/yr. We use the wind solutions from radiation-hydrodynamic models, coupled
to a viscous evolution model to construct a population synthesis model so that
we may study the physical properties of evolving discs and so-called
`transition discs'. Current observations of disc lifetimes and accretion rates
can be matched by our model assuming a viscosity parameter alpha = 2.5e-3. Our
models confirm that X-rays play a dominant role in the evolution and dispersal
of protoplanetary discs giving rise to the observed diverse population of inner
hole `transition' sources which include those with massive outer discs, those
with gas in their inner holes and those with detectable accretion signatures.
To help understand the nature of observed transition discs we present a
diagnostic diagram based on accretion rates versus inner hole sizes that
demonstrate that, contrary to recent claims, many of the observed accreting and
non accreting transition discs can easily be explained by X-ray
photoevaporation. Finally, we confirm the conjecture of Drake et al. (2009),
that accretion is suppressed by the X-rays through `photoevaporation starved
accretion' and predict this effect can give rise to a negative correlation
between X-ray luminosity and accretion rate, as reported in the Orion data.

reflected in its price. The arrival of new information then leads to price
changes. The `information-based framework' of Brody, Hughston and Macrina (BHM)
isolates the emergence of information, and examines its role as a driver of
price dynamics. This approach has led to the development of new models that
capture a broad range of price behaviour. This thesis extends the work of BHM
by introducing a wider class of processes for the generation of the market
filtration. In the BHM framework, each asset is associated with a collection of
random cash flows. The asset price is the sum of the discounted expectations of
the cash flows. Expectations are taken with respect (i) an appropriate measure,
and (ii) the filtration generated by a set of so-called information processes
that carry noisy or imperfect market information about the cash flows. To model
the flow of information, we introduce a class of processes termed L\'evy random
bridges (LRBs), generalising the Brownian and gamma information processes of
BHM. Conditioned on its terminal value, an LRB is identical in law to a L\'evy
bridge. We consider in detail the case where the asset generates a single cash
flow $X_T$ at a fixed date $T$. The flow of information about $X_T$ is modelled
by an LRB with random terminal value $X_T$. An explicit expression for the
price process is found by working out the discounted conditional expectation of
$X_T$ with respect to the natural filtration of the LRB. New models are
constructed using information processes related to the Poisson process, the
Cauchy process, the stable-1/2 subordinator, the variance-gamma process, and
the normal inverse-Gaussian process. These are applied to the valuation of
credit-risky bonds, vanilla and exotic options, and non-life insurance
liabilities.

method, explore its robustness using theoretical synthetic stellar population
models, and apply it using a SDSS sample of $\sim$14 000 ETGs. Our motivation
to look for a new technique has been to minimise the dependence of the cosmic
chronometer method on systematic errors. In particular, as a test of our
method, we derive the value of the Hubble constant $H_0 = 72.6 \pm 2.8$ (stat)
$\pm2.3$ (syst) (68% confidence), which is not only fully compatible with the
value derived from the Hubble key project, but also with a comparable error
budget. Using the SDSS, we also derive, assuming w=constant, a value for the
dark energy equation of state parameter $w = -1 \pm 0.2$ (stat) $\pm0.3$
(syst). Given the fact that the SDSS ETG sample only reaches $z \sim 0.3$, this
result shows the potential of the method. In future papers we will present
results using the high-redshift universe, to yield a determination of H(z) up

improved movement between modes comes at a high computational cost with a low

In recent years, we have detected clear evidence of rotation in more
than 5 hot molecular cores (HMCs). Their identification is confirmed by the
fact that the rotation axes are parallel to the axes of the associated bipolar
outflows. We have now pursued our investigation by extending the sample to 3
known massive cores, G10.62-0.38, G19.61-0.23, and G29.96-0.02. Aims. We wish
to make a thorough study of the structure and kinematics of HMCs and
corresponding molecular outflows to reveal possible velocity gradients
indicative of rotation of the cores. Methods. We carried out PdBI observations
at 2.7 and 1.4~mm of gas and dust with angular resolutions of 2""-3"", and 1""-2"",
respectively. To trace both rotation and expansion, we simultaneously observed
CH3CN, a typical HMC tracer, and 13CO, a typical outflow tracer. Results. The
CH3CN(12-11) observations have revealed the existence of clear velocity
gradients in the three HMCs oriented perpendicular to the direction of the
bipolar outflows. For G19 and G29 the molecular outflows have been mapped in
13CO. The gradients have been interpreted as rotating toroids. The rotation
temperatures, used to derive the mass of the cores, have been obtained by means
of the rotational diagram method, and lie in the range of 87-244 K. The
diameters and masses of the toroids lie in the range of 4550-12600 AU, and
28-415 Msun, respectively. Given that the dynamical masses are 2 to 30 times
smaller than the masses of the cores (if the inclination of the toroids with
respect to the plane of the sky is not much smaller than 45 degrees), we
suggest that the toroids could be accreting onto the embedded cluster. For G19
and G29, the collapse is also suggested by the redshifted absorption seen in
the 13CO(2-1) line. We infer that infall onto the embedded (proto)stars must
proceed with rates of 1E-2 Msun/yr, and on timescales of the order of
4E3-1E4yr...

insulator by the formation of a gap in the fermionic spectrum. This phenomenon
is analogous to the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in the
strong-coupling relativistic field theories. We study this ""chiral symmetry
breaking"" and associated collective excitations on graphene in the strong
coupling regime by taking U(1) lattice gauge theory as an effective model for
graphene. Both compact and non-compact formulations of the U(1) gauge action
show chiral symmetry breaking with equal magnitude of the chiral condensate
(exciton condensate) in the strong coupling limit, while they start to deviate
from the next-to-leading order in the strong coupling expansion. Phase and
amplitude fluctuations of the order parameter are also investigated: in
particular, a mass formula for the pseudo-Nambu--Goldstone mode
($\pi$-exciton), which is analogous to Gell-Mann--Oakes--Renner relation for
the pion in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), is derived from the axial
Ward-Takahashi identity. To check the applicability of the effective field
theory description, typical energy scales of fermionic and bosonic excitations
are estimated by identifying the lattice spacing of the U(1) gauge theory with
that of the original honeycomb lattice of graphene.

both mathematical and engineering fields. This class of problems, arising in
various and across-discipline applications, is known to be NP-hard in general.
In this paper, we aim at providing an approximation theory for the rank
minimization problem, and prove that a rank minimization problem can be
approximated to any level of accuracy via continuous optimization (especially,
linear and nonlinear semidefinite programming) problems. One of the main
results in this paper shows that if the feasible set of the problem has a
minimum rank element with the least F-norm (i.e., Frobenius norm), then the
solution of the approximation problem converges to the minimum rank solution of
the original problem as the approximation parameter tends to zero. The
tractability under certain conditions and convex relaxation of the
approximation problem are also discussed. The methodology and results in this
paper provide a new theoretical basis for the development of some efficient
computational methods for solving rank minimization problems. An immediate
application of this theory to the system of quadratic equations is presented in
this paper. It turns out that the condition for such a system without a nonzero
solution can be characterized by a rank minimization problem, and thus the
proposed approximation theory can be used to establish some sufficient
conditions for the system to possess only zero solution.

observation of Anderson localization, and the realization of the disordered
Bose-Hubbard model. There are however still questions as to how to
differentiate the complex insulating phases resulting from this interplay, and
how to measure the size of the superfluid fragments that these phases entail.
It has been suggested that the correlation function of such a system can give
new insights, but so far little experimental investigation has been performed.
Here, we show the first experimental analysis of the correlation function for a
weakly interacting, bosonic system in a quasiperiodic lattice. We observe an
increase in the correlation length as well as a change in shape of the
correlation function in the delocalization crossover from Anderson glass to
coherent, extended state. In between, the experiment indicates the formation of
progressively larger coherent fragments, consistent with a fragmented BEC, or

observed pa- rameters of GRBs are correlated with their important intrinsic
parameters, like the luminosity or the total radiated energy. These
correlations were derived, tested and used to standardize GRBs, i.e., to derive
their luminosity or radiated energy from one or more observables, in order to
construct an estimated fiducial Hubble diagram, assuming that radiation
propagates in the standard LambdaCDM cosmological model. We extend these
analyses by considering more general models of dark energy, and an updated data
set of high redshift GRBs. We show that the correlation parameters only weakly
depend on the cosmological model. Moreover we apply a local regression
technique to estimate, in a model independent way, the distance modulus from
the recently updated SNIa sample containing 307 SNIa (Astier et al. 2006), in
order to calibrate the GRBs 2D correlations, considering only GRBs with z <1.4.
The derived calibration parameters are used to construct a new GRBs Hubble
diagram, which we call the calibrated GRBs HD. We also compare the estimated
and calibrated GRBs HDs. It turns out that for the common GRBs they are fully
statistically consistent, thus indicating that both of them are not affected by
any systematic bias induced by the different standardizing procedures. We
finally apply our methods to calibrate 95 long GRBs with the well-known Amati
relation and construct the estimated and calibrated GRBs Hubble diagram that
extends to redshifts z ~ 8. Even in this case there is consistency between
these datasets. This means that the high redshift GRBs can be used to test
different models of dark energy. We used the calibrated GRBs HD to constrain
our quintessential cosmological model and derived the likelihood values of

type stars HD 85390, HD 90156 and HD 103197 with the HARPS spectrograph mounted
on the ESO 3.6-m telescope at La Silla observatory. HD 85390 has a planetary
companion with a projected intermediate mass (42.0 Earth masses) on a 788-day
orbit (a=1.52 AU) with an eccentricity of 0.41, for which there is no analogue
in the solar system. A drift in the data indicates the presence of another
companion on a long period orbit, which is however not covered by our
measurements. HD 90156 is orbited by a warm Neptune analogue with a minimum
mass of 17.98 Earth masses (1.05 Neptune masses), a period of 49.8 days (a=0.25
AU) and an eccentricity of 0.31. HD 103197 has an intermediate mass planet on a
circular orbit (P=47.8 d, Msini=31.2 Earth masses). We discuss the formation of
planets of intermediate mass (about 30-100 Earth masses) which should be rare

different types of behaviour in the radio band. Trailing the ""normal"" profile
peak there is an ""intermittent"" peak and these components are flanked by two
additional components showing very erratic ""RRAT-like"" emission. Both the
intermittent and RRAT-like events are extremely rare and are preceded by a
large amplitude glitch in the spin-down parameters. The post-glitch spin-down
rate is smaller than the pre-glitch rate. This type of relaxation is very
unusual for the pulsar population as a whole, but is observed in the glitch
recovery of a RRAT. The abnormal emission behaviour in PSR J1119-6127 was
observed up to three months after the epoch of the large glitch, suggestive of
changes in the magnetospheric conditions during the fast part of the recovery
process. We argue that both the anomalous recoveries and the emission changes
could be related to reconfigurations of the magnetic field. Apart from the
glitches, the spin-down of PSR J1119-6127 is relatively stable, allowing us to
refine the measurement of the braking index (n=2.684\pm0.002) using more than
12 years of timing data. The properties of this pulsar are discussed in light
of the growing evidence that RRATs do not form a distinct class of pulsar, but
rather are a combination of different extreme emission types seen in other
neutron stars. Different sub-classes of the RRATs can potentially be separated
by calculating the lower limit on the modulation index of their emission. We
speculate that if the abnormal behaviour in PSR J1119-6127 is indeed glitch
induced then there might exist a population of neutron stars which only become
visible in the radio band for a short duration in the immediate aftermath of
glitch activity. These neutron stars will be visible in the radio band as
sources that only emit some clustered pulses every so many years.

no flux at 1.8 MeV, while the Disk component on the contrary contains a

spectral shape of the annihilation radiation (the narrow 511 keV line and the
associated othro-positronium continuum) is surprisingly well described by a
model of annihilation of hot positrons in a radiatively cooling interstellar
medium (ISM). The model assumes that positrons are initially injected into a
hot ($\sim 10^6$~K), volume filling ISM, which is allowed to freely cool via
radiative losses. The annihilation time in such a medium is longer than the
cooling time for temperatures higher than a few $10^{4}$~K. Thus, most of the
positrons annihilate only after the gas has cooled down to $\sim 10^5$~K,
giving rise to annihilation emission characteristic of a warm, ionized ISM.

physics accessible within an arbitrarily small neighborhood of a spacetime

fluid in the spherical symmetry. One parameter families of equilibrium
solutions are obtained making it possible to assess stability properties by
means of the standard M(R) method. Normal modes of radial pulsation are
computed as well and are found to confirm the onset of instability as predicted
by the M(R) method. As an example, a stable configuration with outwardly
increasing energy density in the core is obtained with a simple quasi-local
extension of the polytropic EoS. It is also found that the loss of stability
occurs at higher surface compactness when the anisotropy of pressures is

supernova are highly degenerate and therefore numerous during a few seconds of
explosion. In contrast, leptons of other flavors are non-degenerate and
therefore relatively scarce. This is due to lepton flavor conservation. If this
conservation law is broken by some non-standard interactions, electron
neutrinos are converted to muon and tau-neutrinos, and electrons -- to muons.
This affects the supernova dynamics and the supernova neutrino signal in
several ways. In particular, the total neutrino luminosity in the first second
of the collapse is increased due to the larger free path of the non-electron
neutrinos. This effect may have important consequences as the increase of the
neutrino luminosity is known to facilitate the explosion. We consider an
extension of the Standard Model by scalar bileptons which mediate lepton flavor
violation. It is shown that in case of TeV-mass bileptons the electron fermi
gas is equilibrated with non-electron species inside the inner supernova core
at a time-scale of order of (1-100) ms. In particular, a scalar triplet which
generates neutrino masses through the see-saw type II mechanism is considered.
Non-observation of rare decays and data on neutrino mixing and neutrino masses
restrict possible lepton flavor violation effects in this case. However a
region in the parameter space of the model exists which fits all the
experimental constraints and provides lepton flavor violation sufficient for
observable effects in supernova.

close packing) of one-component and binary hard disc fluids. The theoretical
structure used provides a common framework for description of the hard disc
liquid to hexatic, the liquid to hexagonal crystal and the liquid-to-maximally
random jammed state transitions. Our analysis is based on locating a particular
bifurcation of the solutions of the integral equation for the inhomogeneous
single particle density at the transition between different spatial structures.
The bifurcation of solutions we study is initiated from the dense metastable
fluid, and we associate it with the limit of stability of the fluid, which we
identify with the transition from the metastable fluid to a maximally random
jammed state. For the one-component hard disc fluid the predicted packing
fraction at which the metastable fluid to maximally random jammed state
transition occurs is 0.84, in excellent agreement with the experimental value
0.84 \pm 0.02. The corresponding analysis of the limit of stability of a binary
hard disc fluid with specified disc diameter ratio and disc composition
requires extra approximations in the representations of the direct correlation
function, the equation of state, and the number of order parameters accounted
for. Keeping only the order parameter identified with the largest peak in the
structure factor of the highest density regular lattice with the same disc
diameter ratio and disc composition as the binary fluid, the predicted density
of maximally random jamming is found to be 0.84 to 0.87, depending on the
equation of state used, and very weakly dependent on the ratio of disc
diameters and the fluid composition, in agreement with both experimental data

tightly regulated by multiple negative feedback loops embedded in the

profiles important in immune cell differentiation, cell apoptosis, and innate
immunity. The intracellular signaling processes and their control mechanisms,
however, are susceptible to both extrinsic and intrinsic noise. In this
article, we present numerical evidence for a universal dynamic behavior of
NF-{\kappa}B, namely oscillatory nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling, due to the
fundamentally stochastic nature of the NF-{\kappa}B signaling network. We
simulated the effect of extrinsic noise with a deterministic ODE model, using a
statistical ensemble approach, generating many copies of the signaling network
with different kinetic rates sampled from a biologically feasible parameter
space. We modeled the effect of intrinsic noise by simulating the same networks
stochastically using the Gillespie algorithm. The results demonstrate that
extrinsic noise diversifies the shuttling patterns of NF-{\kappa}B response,
whereas intrinsic noise induces oscillatory behavior in many of the otherwise
non-oscillatory patterns. We identify two key model parameters which
significantly affect the NF-{\kappa}B dynamic response and deduce a
two-dimensional phase-diagram of the NF-{\kappa}B response as a function of
these parameters. We conclude that if single-cell experiments are performed, a
rich variety of NF-{\kappa}B response will be observed, even if
population-level experiments, which average response over large numbers of
cells, do not evidence oscillatory behavior.

social network models assumes that the presence or absence of all possible

are no measurement (e.g., recording) errors. This is clearly not true in
practice, as much network data is collected though sample surveys. In addition
even if a census of a population is attempted, individuals and links between

paper we develop the conceptual and computational theory for inference based on
sampled network information. We first review forms of network sampling designs
used in practice. We consider inference from the likelihood framework, and
develop a typology of network data that reflects their treatment within this

from adaptive network designs. We motivate and illustrate these ideas by
analyzing the effect of link-tracing sampling designs on a collaboration

nonlocality is also a valuable resource for information processing tasks, e.g.
quantum communication, quantum key distribution, quantum state estimation, or
randomness extraction. Still, deciding if a quantum state is nonlocal remains a
challenging problem. Here we introduce a novel approach to this question: we
study the nonlocal properties of quantum states when distributed and measured
in networks. Using our framework, we show how any one-way entanglement
distillable state leads to nonlocal correlations. Then, we prove that
nonlocality is a non-additive resource, which can be activated. There exist
states, local at the single-copy level, that become nonlocal when taking
several copies of it. Our results imply that the nonlocality of quantum states
strongly depends on the measurement context.

hyper-Eddington accretion of hot and dense plasma torus onto a newly born black
hole. The prompt gamma ray emission originates in jets at some distance from
this 'central engine' and in most events is rapidly variable, having a form of
spikes and subpulses. This indicates at the variable nature of the engine
itself, for which a plausible mechanism is an internal instability in the
accreting flow. We solve numerically the structure and evolution of the
neutrino-cooled torus. We take into account the detailed treatment of the
microphysics in the nuclear equation of state that includes the neutrino
trapping effect. The models are calculated for both Schwarzschild and Kerr
black holes. We find that for sufficiently large accretion rates (> 10 Msun/s
for non-rotating black hole, and >1 Msun/s for rotating black hole, depending
on its spin), the inner regions of the disk become opaque, while the helium
nuclei are being photodissociated. The sudden change of pressure in this region
leads to the development of a viscous and thermal instability, and the neutrino
pressure acts similarly to the radiation pressure in sub-Eddington disks. In
the case of rapidly rotating black holes, the instability is enhanced and
appears for much lower accretion rates. We also find the important and possibly
further destabilizing role of the energy transfer from the rotating black hole
to the torus via the magnetic coupling.

extrinsic noise is regarded as fluctuations in the values of kinetic parameters
and such fluctuations are modeled by randomly sampling the kinetic rate
constants from a uniform distribution. We consider a large number of signaling
system replicates, each of which has the same network topology, but a uniquely
different set of kinetic rate constants. A protein dynamic response from each
replicate should represent the dynamics in a single cell and the statistical
ensemble average should be regarded as a population-level response averaged
over a population of the cells. We devise an optimization algorithm to find the
correct uniform distribution of the network parameters, which produces the
correct statistical distribution of the response whose ensemble average and
distribution agree well with the population-level experimental data and the
experimentally observed heterogeneity. We apply this statistical ensemble
analysis to a NF-{\kappa}B signaling system and (1) predict the distributions
of the heterogeneous NF-{\kappa}B (either oscillatory or non-oscillatory)
dynamic patterns and of the dynamic features (e.g., period), (2) predict that
both the distribution and the statistical ensemble average of the NF-{\kappa}B

demonstrate and illustrate the new methodology, we present results of
infrared-to-radio lightcurve fitting of a succession of outbursts observed in
1994 in the microquasar Cyg X-3. We find that the diversity of outbursts in
shape, amplitude, frequency range and timescale can be fairly described by
varying only the strength of the shock and its build-up distance from the apex
of the jet. A rapid build-up results in high-frequency outbursts evolving on
short timescales, while slowly evolving, low-frequency outbursts form and
evolve further out in the jet. We conclude by outlining future developments, in
particular the inclusion of the associated synchrotron self-Compton emission at

attractive is the simplicity with which its electronic structure can be

the linear dispersion relation of electrons in a narrow range around the Fermi
level. Unfortunately, the mathematical simplicity of graphene electrons is only
limited to this narrow energy region and is useless when dealing with problems
that involve energies outside the linear dispersion part of the spectrum. In
this letter we remedy this limitation by deriving a set of closed-form
analytical expressions for the real-space single-electron Green function of
graphene which are valid across an enormous fraction of the energy spectrum. By
extending to a wider energy range the simplicity with which graphene electrons
are described, it is now possible to derive more mathematically transparent and
insightful expressions for a number of physical properties that involve higher
energy scales. The power of this new formalism is illustrated in the case of
the magnetic (RKKY) interaction in graphene.

We will work using the phenomenological MIT Bag model. The stability of the

variation of parameters from the model: s quark mass, baryonic density,
magnetic field and the Bag parameter. Results obtained were compared with those
of magnetized normal quark matter (only u and d quarks in beta equilibrium) as
well as the Strange Quark Matter (SQM). It is found that the energy per baryon
decreases with the increasing magnetic field which implies that the MSQM is
more stable than SQM. The Equations of State previously obtained are used to
obtain stable configurations of magnetized strange stars checking that the

double-layer capacitor has been observed. We explain this effect by the image
forces which exponentially screen out the electrostatic interactions of ions in
the interior of a pore. Packing of ions of the same sign becomes easier and is
mainly limited by steric interactions. We call this state `superionic' and
suggest a simple model to describe it. The model reveals a possibility of a
voltage-induced first-order transition between a cation(anion)-deficient phase
and a cation(anion)-rich phase which manifests itself in a jump of capacitance
as a function of voltage.

individuals and sensitive information flows everyday into data stores. Examples
include web queries, credit card transactions, medical exam records, transit

data analysis centers is a common situation. In this paper we show that, in
most domains, correlations among sensitive values associated to the same
individuals in different releases can be easily mined, and used to violate
users' privacy by adversaries observing multiple data releases. We provide a
formal model for privacy attacks based on this sequential background knowledge,
as well as on background knowledge on the probability distribution of sensitive
values over different individuals. We show how sequential background knowledge
can be actually obtained by an adversary, and used to identify with high
confidence the sensitive values associated with an individual. A defense
algorithm based on Jensen-Shannon divergence is proposed, and extensive
experiments show the superiority of the proposed technique with respect to
other applicable solutions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
work that systematically investigates the role of sequential background

weakly incoherent limit, when the interlayer transfer integral is smaller than
the Landau level broadening due to the impurity potential, but the interlayer
electron tunnelling conserves the intralayer momentum. It is shown that the
impurity potential has much stronger effect in this regime, than in the
quasi-2D metals in the coherent limit. The weakly incoherent regime has several
new qualitative features, not found in the previous theoretical approaches. The
background interlayer magnetoresistance in this regime monotonically grows with
increasing of magnetic field perpendicular to the conducting layers. The
effective electron mean free time is considerably shorter than in the coherent
regime and decreases with magnetic field. This enhances the role of higher
harmonics in the angular magnetoresistance oscillations and increases the
Dingle temperature, which damps the magnetic quantum oscillations.

a new formula for the analytical planar limit of a random matrix model with a
one-cut potential $V$. For potentials $V(x)=x^{2}/2-\sum_{n\ge1}a_{n}x^{n}/n$,
as a power series in all $a_{n}$, the formal Taylor expansion of the analytic
planar limit is exactly the formal planar limit. In the case $V$ is analytic in
infinitely many variables $\{a_{n}\}_{n\ge1}$ (on the appropriate spaces), the
planar limit is also an analytic function in infinitely many variables and we
give quantitative versions of where this is defined.
  Particularly useful in enumerative combinatorics are the gradings of $V$,
$V_{t}(x)=x^{2}/2-\sum_{n\ge1}a_{n}t^{n/2}x^{n}/n$ and
$V_{t}(x)=x^{2}/2-\sum_{n\ge3}a_{n}t^{n/2 -1}x^{n}/n$. The associated planar
limits $F(t)$ as functions of $t$ count planar diagram sorted by the number of
edges respectively faces. We point out a method of computing the asymptotic of
the coefficients of $F(t)$ using the combination of the \emph{wzb} method and
the resolution of singularies. This is illustrated in several computations
revolving around the important extreme potential
$V_{t}(x)=x^{2}/2+\log(1-\sqrt{t}x)$ and its variants. This particular example
gives a quantitive and sharp answer to a conjecture of t'Hoofts which states
that if the potential is analytic, the planar limit is also analytic.

five dimensional space-time unifying gravitation and electromagnetism, and
extension to higher-dimensional space-time. By considering the classification
of positive Einstein curvature tensors and the classical Cauchy-Choquet-Bruhat
theorems in general relativity, we introduce concepts of types and rigidity.
Then, abandoning the usual requirement of a Ricci-flat five dimensional
space-time, we show that a unified geometrical frame can be set for gravitation
and electromagnetism, giving, by projection on the classical 4-dimensional
space-time, the known Einstein-Maxwell-Lorentz equations for charged fluids.
Thus, although not introducing, at least at this stage, new physics, we get a
very aesthetic presentation of classical physics in the spirit of general
relativity. The usual physical concepts, such as mass, energy, charge,
trajectory, Maxwell-Lorentz law, are shown to be only various aspects of the
geometry, for example curvature, of space-time considered as a Lorentzian
manifold; that is no physical objects are introduced in space-time, no laws are
given, everything is only geometry. We will then extend this setting to more
than 5 dimensions, giving a precise mathematical frame for possible additional
physical effects, preserving gravitation and electromagnetism.
