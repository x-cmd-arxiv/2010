formal lan- guages which have been inspired by the hairpin formation in
DNA-biochemistry. The paper answers two questions asked in the literature about
the iterated hairpin completion.
  The first question is whether the class of regular languages is closed under
iterated bounded hairpin completion. Here we show that this is true by
providing a more general result which applies to all the classes of languages
which are closed under finite union, intersection with regular sets, and
concatenation with regular sets. In particular, all Chomsky classes and all
standard complexity classes are closed under iterated bounded hairpin
completion.
  In the second part of the paper we address the question whether the iterated
hairpin completion of a singleton is always regular. In contrast to the first
question, this one has a negative answer. We exhibit an example of a singleton
language whose iterated hairpin completion is not regular, actually it is not
context-free, but context-sensitive.

  We carried out a survey of 56 stars using diffraction-limited near-infrared

  Thirty-three companion candidates in 24 binaries, three triples, and one
quadruple system were detected. Nine companion candidates were found for the

detected companion candidates have K magnitudes between 5.95m and 18.07m and
angular separations ranging from <0.05"" to 7.8"", corresponding to linear

  Our study clearly confirms that HgMn stars are frequently members of binary

the multiplicity fraction in our sample may be as high as 91%. The membership
in binary and multiple systems seems to be a key point to understanding the

they do not determine but that are chosen to fit solar or stellar observations.
We investigate if changes of these length scales are required between the Sun
and low mass stars on the red giant branch (RGB). The question is addressed
jointly in the frameworks of the mixing length theory and of the full spectrum
of turbulence model. For both models, the convective length scale is assumed to
be a fixed fraction of the local pressure scale height. We use constraints
coming from the observed effective temperatures and linear radii independently.
We rely on a sample of 38 nearby giants and subgiants for which surface
temperatures and luminosities are known accurately and the radii are determined
through interferometry to better than 10%. For the few cases where the stellar
masses were determined by asteroseismological measurements, we computed
dedicated models. First we calibrate the solar models. Then, with the same
physics, we compute RGB models for masses between 0.9 Mo and 2.5 Mo and
metallicities ranging from $\rm [Fe/H]=-0.34$ to solar. The evolution is
followed up to 1000 Lo. A special attention is given to the opacities and to
the non grey atmosphere models used as boundary conditions for which the model
of convection is the same as in the interior. We find that for both the mixing
length theory and the full spectrum of turbulence model the characteristic
solar length scale for convection has to be slightly reduced to fit the lower
edge of the observed RGB. The corresponding models also better match the
expected mass distribution on the RGB and are in better agreement to the
seismic constraints. These results are robust whether effective temperatures
determined spectroscopically or radii determined interferometrically are used.

174 early-type stars selected from the literature. The stars are first
classified according to their evolutionary status in order to obtain a
homogeneous sample of 96 genuine main sequence stars. Their present velocities
and flight times are then estimated using proper motion data from various
astrometric catalogues (including Tycho-2, UCAC2, and USNO-B) and the ejection
velocities are computed by tracing their orbits back in time, based on a
galactic potential. The potential used is constructed from a mass density model
chosen to fit the most recent observational constraints. We find evidence for
two different populations of runaway stars: a ""high"" velocity population, with
a maximum ejection velocity of about 400 - 500 km/s, and a ""low"" velocity
population, with a maximum ejection velocity of about 300 km/s. We argue that
the observed limit of 500 km/s and the bimodality of the observed ejection
velocity distribution are natural consequences of the so-called Binary Ejection
Mechanism. We discuss the connection between the ""high"" velocity population and
the so-called hypervelocity stars, showing how previously studied hypervelocity
stars are consistent with the results obtained. We also find that some stars
that were once thought to be best explained as being formed in the Halo are
compatible with a runaway hypothesis once proper motions are included in the
analysis. However, three stars in the selected sample appear to be inconsistent
with ejection from the galactic disc. Possible scenarios are discussed,
including a possible formation in the galactic halo.

significant land resources to separate each wind turbine from the adjacent
turbine wakes. This aerodynamic constraint limits the amount of power that can
be extracted from a given wind farm footprint. The resulting inefficiency of
HAWT farms is currently compensated by using taller wind turbines to access
greater wind resources at high altitudes, but this solution comes at the
expense of higher engineering costs and greater visual, acoustic, radar and
environmental impacts. We investigated the use of counter-rotating
vertical-axis wind turbines (VAWTs) in order to achieve higher power output per
unit land area than existing wind farms consisting of HAWTs. Full-scale field
tests of 10-m tall VAWTs in various counter-rotating configurations were
conducted under natural wind conditions during summer 2010. Whereas modern wind
farms consisting of HAWTs produce 2 to 3 watts of power per square meter of
land area, these field tests indicate that power densities an order of
magnitude greater can potentially be achieved by arranging VAWTs in layouts
that enable them to extract energy from adjacent wakes and from above the wind
farm. Moreover, this improved performance does not require higher individual
wind turbine efficiency, only closer wind turbine spacing and a sufficient
vertical flux of turbulence kinetic energy from the atmospheric surface layer.
The results suggest an alternative approach to wind farming that has the
potential to concurrently reduce the cost, size, and environmental impacts of
wind farms.

(TM)-polarized, radiation ranging from 240nm to 1500nm and incident angles from
0 degree to 90 degree. In particular, we study the case of a silver grating
placed in vacuo. Consistent with previous studies on the topic, we highlight
that the main mechanism for extraordinary transmission is a TM-Fabry-Perot (FP)
branch supported by waveguide modes inside each slit. The TM-FP branch may also
interact with surface plasmons (SPs) at the air/Ag interface through the
reciprocal lattice vectors of the grating, for periods comparable with the
incoming wavelength. When the TM-FP branch crosses a SP branch, a band gap is
formed along the line of the SP dispersion. The gap has a Fano-Feshbach
resonance at the low frequency band edge and a ridge resonance with extremely
long lifetime at the high frequency band edge. We discuss the nature of these
dispersion features, and in particular we describe the ridge resonance in the
framework of guided-mode resonances (GMRs). In addition, we elucidate the
connection of the coupling between the TM-FP branch and SPs within the Rayleigh
condition. We also study the peculiar characteristics of the field localization
and the energy transport in two topical examples.

in which the second argument is evaluated only if the first argument does not
suffice to determine the value of the expression. In programming, short-circuit
evaluation is widely used, with sequential conjunction and disjunction as

  A short-circuit logic is a variant of propositional logic (PL) that can be
defined with help of Hoare's conditional, a ternary connective comparable to
if-then-else, and that implies all identities that follow from four basic
axioms for the conditional and can be expressed in PL (e.g., axioms for
associativity of conjunction and double negation shift). In the absence of side
effects, short-circuit evaluation characterizes PL. However, short-circuit
evaluation admits the possibility to model side effects and gives rise to
various different short-circuit logics. The first extreme case is FSCL (free
short-circuit logic), which characterizes the setting in which evaluation of
each atom (propositional variable) can yield a side effect. The other extreme
case is MSCL (memorizing short-circuit logic), the most identifying variant we
distinguish below PL. In MSCL, only a very restricted type of side effects can
be modelled, while sequential conjunction is non-commutative. We provide
axiomatizations for FSCL and MSCL.
  Extending MSCL with one simple axiom yields SSCL (static short-circuit logic,
or sequential PL), for which we also provide a completeness result. We briefly
discuss two variants in between FSCL and MSCL, among which a logic that admits
contraction of atoms and of their negations.

level by one, so that they can be solved iteratively in the loop order. We
present several infinite series of integrals satisfying such iterative
differential equations. The differential operators we use are best written
using momentum twistor space. The use of the latter was advocated in recent
papers discussing loop integrals in N=4 super Yang-Mills. One of our
motivations is to provide a tool for deriving analytical results for scattering
amplitudes in this theory. We show that the integrals needed for planar MHV
amplitudes up to two loops can be thought of as deriving from a single master
topology. The master integral satisfies our differential equations, and so do
most of the reduced integrals. A consequence of the differential equations is
that the integrals we discuss are not arbitrarily complicated transcendental
functions. For two specific two-loop integrals we give the full analytic
solution. The simplicity of the integrals appearing in the scattering
amplitudes in planar N=4 super Yang-Mills is strongly suggestive of a relation
to the conjectured underlying integrability of the theory. We expect these
differential equations to be relevant for all planar MHV and non-MHV
amplitudes. We also discuss possible extensions of our method to more general
classes of integrals.

models requires us to correctly account for all relevant interactions between
adiabatic and non-adiabatic modes around and after horizon crossing. One
specific complication arises from derivative interactions induced by the
curvilinear trajectory of the inflaton in a multi-dimensional field space. In
this work we compute the power spectrum in general multi-field models and show
that certain inflaton trajectories may lead to observationally significant
imprints of `heavy' physics in the primordial power spectrum if the inflaton
trajectory turns, that is, traverses a bend, sufficiently fast (without
interrupting slow roll), even in cases where the normal modes have masses
approaching the cutoff of our theory. We emphasise that turning is defined with
respect to the geodesics of the sigma model metric, irrespective of whether
this is canonical or non-trivial. The imprints generically take the form of
damped superimposed oscillations on the power spectrum. In the particular case
of two-field models, if one of the fields is sufficiently massive compared to
the scale of inflation, we are able to compute an effective low energy theory
for the adiabatic mode encapsulating certain relevant operators of the full
multi-field dynamics. As expected, a particular characteristic of this
effective theory is a modified speed of sound for the adiabatic mode which is a
functional of the background inflaton trajectory and the turns traversed during
inflation. Hence in addition, we expect non-Gaussian signatures directly
related to the features imprinted in the power spectrum.

the log g distribution in different color bins. We further attempt to use these

shows that -- for our color ranges -- the infrared bands alone provide no

dwarfs (the contamination) remains above 20%.

defined as the signal efficiency of a cut or multivariate discriminant divided
by the square root of the background efficiency, is shown to be an extremely
powerful visualization tool. SIC curves demonstrate numerical instabilities in
the multivariate discriminants, show convergence as the number of variables is
increased, and display the sensitivity to the optimal cut values. For our
application, we concentrate on Higgs boson production in association with a W
or Z boson with H -> bb and compare to the irreducible standard model
background, Z/W + bb. We explore thousands of experimentally motivated,
physically motivated, and unmotivated single variable discriminants. Along with
the standard kinematic variables, a number of new ones, such as twist, are
described which should have applicability to many processes. We find that some
single variables, such as the pull angle, are weak discriminants, but when
combined with others they provide important marginal improvement. We also find
that multiple Higgs boson-candidate mass measures, such as from mild and
aggressively trimmed jets, when combined may provide additional discriminating
power. Comparing the significance improvement from our variables to those used
in recent CDF and DZero searches, we find that a 10-20% improvement in
significance against Z/W + bb is possible. Our analysis also suggests that the
H + W/Z channel with H -> bb is also viable at the LHC, without requiring a
hard cut on the W/Z transverse momentum.

Clouds show us that the contribution from photoionized gas is very important
during the first Myr of cluster evolution. We present our models which include
both a self-consistent treatment of the photoionized gas and the stellar
continuum and quantify the impact of such nebular component on the total flux
of young unresolved star clusters. A comparison with other available models is
considered. The very young star clusters in the SBS 0335-052E dwarf starburst
galaxy are used as a test for our models. Due to the low metallicity of the
galactic medium our models predict a longer lasted nebular phase which
contributes between 10-40% of the total near infrared (NIR) fluxes at around 10
Myr. We propose thus a possible solution for the observed flux excess in the 6
bright super star clusters of SBS 0335-052E. Reines et al. showed that the
observed cluster fluxes, in the red-optical and NIR range, sit irreconcilably
above the provided stellar continuum models. We find that in the age range

transient in NGC 1058 that has variously been categorized as either a true core
collapse SN leaving a black hole (BH) or neutron star (NS) remnant, or an
eruption of a luminous blue variable (LBV) star. The former case is suggested
by its association with a decaying non-thermal radio source, while the latter
is suggested by its peculiar transient light curve and its low initial
expansion velocities. The crucial difference is that the star survives a
transient eruption but not an SN. All stars identified as possible survivors
are significantly fainter, L_opt ~ 10^5 Lsun, than the L_opt ~ 3 10^6 Lsun
progenitor star at optical wavelengths. While this can be explained by dust
absorption in a shell of material ejected during the transient, the survivor
must then be present as a L_IR ~ 3 10^6 Lsun mid-infrared source. Using
archival Spitzer observations of the region, we show that such a luminous
mid-IR source is not present. The brightest source of dust emission is only
L_IR ~ 10^5 Lsun and does not correspond to the previously identified
candidates for the surviving star. The dust cannot be made sufficiently distant
and cold to avoid detection unless the ejection energy, mass and velocity
scales are those of a SN or greater. We conclude that SN 1961V was a peculiar,
but real, supernova. Its peculiarities are probably due to enhanced mass loss
just prior to the SN, followed by the interactions of the SN blast wave with
this ejecta. This adds to the evidence that there is a population of SN
progenitors that have major mass loss episodes shortly before core collapse.
The progenitor is a low metallicity, ~1/3 solar, high mass, M_ZAMS > 80 Msun,

that they should be significant contributors to the full super-Earth population

that galaxy formation in the QSO neighborhood proceeds differently than in the

consider the timing of brightening events as they pertain to the putative
binary system in etaCar: (1) The brief 1838 and 1843 events peaked within weeks
of periastron if the pre-1845 orbital period is shorter than at present due to
the mass loss of the eruption. Each event lasted only 100 days. (2) The main
brightening at the end of 1844 has no conceivable association with periastron,
beginning more than 1.5yr afterward. It lasted 10yr, with no obvious influence
of periastron encounters during that time. (3) The 1890 eruption began to
brighten at periastron, but took over 1yr to reach maximum and remained there
for almost 10yr. A second periastron passage midway through the 1890 eruption
had no effect. While evidence for a link between periastron encounters and the
two brief precursor events is compelling, the differences between the three
cases above make it difficult to explain all three phenomena with the same
mechanism.

fractional power of k. These features may allow significant observational
constraints on the particle physics origin of any observed local
non-Gaussianity, distinguishing between scenarios where a single field or
multiple fields contribute to the curvature fluctuations. While analytic

reflects the triaxiality of the subprofile. We develop a simple model that

liquid with gapless or gapped spin-1 but fermionic excitations. When TRS is
broken, the resulting spin liquid exhibits deconfined vortex excitations which
carry spin-1/2 quantum number and obey non-Abelian statistics. We show that
this SU(2) invariant non-Abelian spin liquid exhibits spin quantum Hall effect
with quantized spin Hall conductivity \sigma^s_{xy}=\hbar/2\pi, and that the
spin response is effectively described the SO(3) level-1 Chern-Simons theory at
low energy. We further propose that a SU(2) level-2 Chern-Simons theory is the
effective field theory describing the topological structure of the non-Abelian

absorbed `overlapping-trough' iron low-ionization broad absorption line
(FeLoBAL) quasar FBQS J1408+3054. Over a time span of between 0.6 to 5
rest-frame years, the Mg II trough outflowing at 12,000 km/s decreased in
equivalent width by a factor of two and the Fe II troughs at the same velocity
disappeared. The most likely explanation for the variability is that a
structure in the BAL outflow moved out of our line of sight to the ultraviolet
continuum emitting region of the quasar's accretion disk. Given the size of
that region, this structure must have a transverse velocity of between 2600
km/s and 22,000 km/s. In the context of a simple outflow model, we show that
this BAL structure is located between approximately 5800 and 46,000
Schwarzschild radii from the black hole. That distance corresponds to 1.7 to 14
pc, 11 to 88 times farther from the black hole than the H-beta broad-line
region. The high velocities and the parsec-scale distance for at least this one
FeLoBAL outflow mean that not all FeLoBAL outflows can be associated with
galaxy-scale outflows in ultraluminous infrared galaxies transitioning to
unobscured quasars. The change of FBQS J1408+3054 from an FeLoBAL to a LoBAL
quasar also means that if (some) FeLoBAL quasars have multiwavelength
properties which distinguish them from HiBAL quasars, then some LoBAL quasars
will share those properties. Finally, we extend previous work on how
multiple-epoch spectroscopy of BAL and non-BAL quasars can be used to constrain
the average lifetime of BAL episodes (currently >60 rest-frame years at 90%

orientation and movement of molecules in three-dimensional space. An ultracold
molecular gas, with a temperature below 1 uK, provides a highly unusual regime
for chemistry, where polar molecules can easily be oriented using an external
electric field and where, moreover, the motion of two colliding molecules is
strictly quantized. Recently, atom-exchange reactions were observed in a
trapped ultracold gas of KRb molecules. In an external electric field, these
exothermic and barrierless bimolecular reactions, KRb+KRb -> K2+Rb2, occur at a
rate that rises steeply with increasing dipole moment. Here we show that the
quantum stereodynamics of the ultracold collisions can be exploited to suppress
the bimolecular chemical reaction rate by nearly two orders of magnitude. We
use an optical lattice trap to confine the fermionic polar molecules in a
quasi-two-dimensional, pancake-like geometry, with the dipoles oriented along
the tight confinement direction. With the combination of sufficiently tight
confinement and Fermi statistics of the molecules, two polar molecules can
approach each other only in a ""side-by-side"" collision, where the chemical
reaction rate is suppressed by the repulsive dipole-dipole interaction. We show
that the suppression of the bimolecular reaction rate requires quantum-state
control of both the internal and external degrees of freedom of the molecules.
The suppression of chemical reactions for polar molecules in a
quasi-two-dimensional trap opens the way for investigation of a dipolar
molecular quantum gas. Because of the strong, long-range character of the
dipole-dipole interactions, such a gas brings fundamentally new abilities to
quantum-gas-based studies of strongly correlated many-body physics, where
quantum phase transitions and new states of matter can emerge.

in the framework of Matrix Product States (MPS) and their associated parent
Hamiltonians, for systems with unique as well as degenerate ground states, and
both in the absence and presence of symmetries. We find that without
symmetries, all systems are in the same phase, up to accidental ground state
degeneracies. If symmetries are imposed, phases without symmetry breaking
(i.e., with unique ground states) are classified by the cohomology classes of
the symmetry group, this is, the equivalence classes of its projective
representations, a result first derived in [X. Chen, Z.-C. Gu, and X.-G. Wen,
Phys. Rev. B 83, 035107 (2011); arXiv:1008.3745]. For phases with symmetry
breaking (i.e., degenerate ground states), we find that the symmetry consists
of two parts, one of which acts by permuting the ground states, while the other
acts on individual ground states, and phases are labelled by both the
permutation action of the former and the cohomology class of the latter. Using
Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS), we subsequently extend our framework to
the classification of two-dimensional phases in the neighborhood of a number of
important cases, in particular systems with unique ground states, degenerate
ground states with a local order parameter, and topological order. We also show
that in two dimensions, imposing symmetries does not constrain the phase
diagram in the same way it does in one dimension. As a central tool, we
introduce the isometric form, a normal form for MPS and PEPS which is a
renormalization fixed point. Transforming a state to its isometric form does
not change the phase, and thus, we can focus on to the classification of
isometric forms.

$\crit(\Phi)$ is nonempty and every component has codimension equal to $p$, in
terms of syzygies among polynomial master functions.
  If \A is $p$-generic, then $D$ is contained in the degree $p$ resonance

on resonance and critical loci of master functions. Any arrangement is

was recently detected in the NLS1 galaxy 1H0707-495. We interpreted the lag as
being due to reflection from matter close to the black hole, within a few
gravitational radii of the event horizon (an inner reflector). It has since
been claimed by Miller et al that the lag can be produced by more distant
matter, at hundreds of gravitational radii (an outer reflector). Here, we
critically explore their interpretation of the lag. The detailed energy
dependence of the time lags between soft and hard energy bands is well modelled
by an inner reflector using our previously published spectral model. A contrary
claim by Miller et al was obtained by neglecting the blackbody component in the
soft band. Soft lags can be produced by a large-scale outer reflector if
several, implausible, conditions are met. An additional transfer function is
required in the soft band corresponding to a region that is physically close to
the continuum source, or lies close to our line of sight and subtends a small
solid angle at the source, challenging the production of the observed spectrum.
We show that the original inner reflector interpretation of reverberation very
close to the black hole provides a self-consistent and robust model which
explains the energy spectrum and timing properties, including the time delays,
power spectra and the shape of the coherence function. Several of these
properties are opposite to the predictions from a simple large-scale outer
reflection model.

matter could produce rich phenomena in cosmology. It affects cosmic structure
formation mainly through the fifth force, a velocity-dependent force that acts
parallel to particle's direction of motion and proportional to its speed, an
effective rescaling of the particle masses, and a modified background expansion
rate. In many cases these effects entangle and it is difficult to see which is
the dominant one. Here we perform N-body simulations to study their qualitative
behaviour and relative importance in affecting the key structure formation
observables, for a model with exponential scalar field coupling. We find that
the fifth force, a prominent example of the scalar-coupling effects, is far
less important than the rescaling of particle mass or the modified expansion
rate. In particular, the rescaling of particle masses is shown to be the key
factor leading to less concentration of particles in halos than in LCDM, a
pattern which is also observed in previous independent coupled scalar field
simulations.

supersonic, hydrodynamic turbulence driven using purely solenoidal Fourier
modes, we find that the `standard' relationship between the variance in the log
of density and the Mach number squared, i.e., sigma^2_(ln rho/rhobar)=ln (1+b^2
M^2), with b = 1/3 is a good fit to the numerical results in the supersonic
regime up to at least Mach 20, similar to previous determinations at lower Mach
numbers. While direct measurements of the variance in linear density are found
to be severely underestimated by finite resolution effects, it is possible to
infer the linear density variance via the assumption of log-normality in the
Probability Distribution Function. The inferred relationship with Mach number,
consistent with sigma_(rho/rhobar) ~ b M with b=1/3, is, however, significantly
shallower than observational determinations of the relationship in the Taurus
Molecular Cloud and IC5146 (both consistent with b~ 0.5), implying that
additional physics such as gravity is important in these clouds and/or that
turbulent driving in the ISM contains a significant compressive component.
Magnetic fields are not found to change this picture significantly, in general
reducing the measured variances and thus worsening the discrepancy with
observations.

cosmology, the wave packet remains semi-classical until it nears the classical
singularity at which point it enters a quantum regime in which the fluctuations
become large. The expectation value of the radius reaches a minimum as the wave
packet is reflected from the origin and emerges to form a near Gaussian but
asymmetrical semi-classical state at late times. The value of the minimum
depends in a non-trivial way on the initial mass/energy of the pulse, its width
and the polymerization scale. For wave packets that are sufficiently narrow
near the bounce, the semi-classical bounce radius is obtained. Although the
numerics become difficult to control in this limit, we argue that for pulses of
finite width the bounce persists as the polymerization scale goes to zero,
suggesting that in this model the loop quantum gravity effects mimicked by
polymer quantization do not play a crucial role in the quantum bounce.

an eccentric binary system induces an eruption or explosion seen as a brief
transient source, attributed to LBVs, SN impostors, or other transients. The
key ingredient is that an evolved primary increases its photospheric radius on
relatively short timescales, to a point where the radius is comparable to or
larger than the periastron separation in an eccentric binary. In such a
configuration, a violent and sudden collision would ensue, possibly leading to
substantial mass ejection instead of a binary merger. Repeated periastral
grazings in an eccentric system could quickly escalate to a catastrophic
encounter, wherein the companion star actually plunges deep inside the
photosphere of a bloated primary during periastron, as a result of the primary
star increasing its own radius. This is motivated by the case of $\eta$
Carinae, where such a collision must have occured if conventional estimates of
the present-day orbit are correct, and where brief peaks in the light curve
coincide with periastron. Stellar collisions may explain brief recurring LBV
outbursts like SN 2000ch and SN 2009ip, and perhaps outbursts from relatively
low-mass progenitor stars (collisons are not necessarily the exclusive domain
of very luminous stars). Finally, mass ejections induced repeatedly at
periastron cause orbital evolution; this may explain the origin of very
eccentric colliding-wind Wolf-Rayet binaries such as WR140.

continuously monitored a number of Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with similar
sampling rates for 14 years from 1996 January to 2009 December. Utilizing the
archival ASM data of 27 AGNs, we calculate the normalized excess variances of
the 300-day binned X-ray light curves on the longest timescale (between 300
days and 14 years) explored so far. The observed variance appears to be
independent of AGN black hole mass and bolometric luminosity, respectively.
According to the scaling relation with black hole mass (and bolometric
luminosity) from Galactic black hole X-ray binaries (GBHs) to AGNs, the break
timescales which correspond to the break frequencies detected in the power
spectral density (PSD) of our AGNs are larger than binsize (300 days) of the
ASM light curves. As a result, the singly broken power-law (soft-state) PSD
predicts the variance to be independent of mass and luminosity, respectively.
Nevertheless, the doubly-broken power-law (hard-state) PSD predicts, with the
widely accepted ratio of the two break frequencies, that the variance increases
with increasing mass and decreases with increasing luminosity, respectively.
Therefore, the independence of the observed variance on mass and luminosity
suggests that AGNs should have the soft-state PSDs. If taking into account the
scaling of breaking timescale with mass and luminosity synchronously, the
observed variances are also more consistent with the soft-state than the
hard-state PSD predictions. With the averaged variance of AGNs and the
soft-state PSD assumption, we obtain a universal PSD amplitude of
$0.030\pm0.022$. By analogy with the GBH PSDs in the high/soft state, the
longest timescale variability supports the standpoint that AGNs are scaled-up
GBHs in the high accretion state, as already implied by the direct PSD
analysis.

of pulse arrival times with emphasis on intrinsic pulse jitterand plasma
propagation effects (particularly interstellar scattering), which are
stochastic in time and have diverse dependences on radio frequency. To reduce
their contribution, timing measurements can be made over a range of frequencies
that depends on a variety of pulsar and instrumentation-dependent factors that
we identify. A salient trend for high signal-to-noise measurements of
millisecond pulsars is that time-of-arrival precision is limited either by
irreducible interstellar scattering or by pulse-phase jitter caused by variable
emission within pulsar magnetospheres. A cap on timing errors implies that
pulsars must be confined to low dispersion measures (DMs) and observed at high
frequencies. Use of wider bandwidths that increase signal-to-noise ratios will
degrade timing precision if nondispersive chromatic effects are not mitigated.
The allowable region in the DM-frequency plane depends on how chromatic timing
perturbations are addressed. Without mitigation, observations at 1.4~GHz or
5~GHz are restricted to $\DM\lesssim 30$ and $\lesssim 100~\DMu$, respectively.
With aggressive mitigation of interstellar scattering and use of large
telescopes to provide adequate sensitivity at high frequencies (e.g. Arecibo,
FAST, phase 1 of the SKA, and the SKA), pulsars with DMs up to 500~$\DMu$ can
be used in precision timing applications. We analyze methods that fit arrival
times vs. frequency at a given epoch prior to multi-epoch fitting. While the
terms of greatest astrophysical interest are achromatic (e.g. orbital and
gravitational wave perturbations), measurements may ultimately be limited by

relationships between halos over a wide range of mass. Observationally it can
be difficult to identify the markers that characterize these relationships
because of the small numbers of visible probes and confusion from contaminants
in projection. Nonetheless, in favorable circumstances it is possible to
identify a very useful marker: the radius of the caustic at second turnaround.
In a few favorable circumstances it is possible to identify the radius of first
turnaround, or zero velocity surface about a collapsed region. It will be shown
that specifically the radius of second turnaround scales as anticipated over
three orders of magnitude in mass from 10^12 to 10^15 M_sun. Halos are
characterized by zones of dispersed velocities within the second turnaround
caustic and zones of infall between the first and second turnaround radii. The
inner zone is populated in the majority by gas poor morphologies and the outer
zone is populated in the majority by gas rich morphologies. The numbers of
dwarfs within the inner zone is roughly constant per unit halo mass.

around bright galaxies can be clearly identified by the distribution of dwarfs

the faint end slopes are in the range -1.35 < alpha < -1.2, much flatter than
the slope for the bottom end of the halo mass spectrum anticipated by LambdaCDM
hierarchical clustering theory. Small but significant variations are found with
environment. Interestingly, the populations of dwarf galaxies are roughly
constant per unit halo mass. With the numbers of dwarfs as an anchor point,
evolved environments (dominated by early morphological types) have relatively
fewer intermediate luminosity systems and at least one relatively more
important galaxy at the core. The variations with environment are consistent
with a scenario of galaxy merging. However it is questionable if the universal
dearth of visible dwarf systems is a consequence of an astrophysical process

several new mass relations are derived, which are mostly generalizations of

for the masses are fixed by fitting them to the masses of the baryon octet and
the masses of $\Omega^{-}$ and $\Theta^{+}$ as input rather than by extracting
them from a calculated self-consistent soliton profile. In particular, the

In addition, we also obtain the pion-nucleon sigma term which turns out to be
$\Sigma_{\pi N} = 36.4\pm3.9\,\mathrm{MeV}$. We get the ratio of the current

without heat flow can be constructed, due to the coupling of the fluid with the

study the general junction conditions across the surface of a star. In general,
the conditions allow the existence of a thin matter shell on the surface. When

wireless systems in breaking the interference bottleneck in cellular systems.
In the MIMO systems, open-loop transmission scheme is used to support mobile
stations (MSs) with high mobilities because the base stations (BSs) do not need
to track the fast varying channel fading. In this paper, we consider an
open-loop network MIMO system with $K$ BSs serving K private MSs and $M^c$
common MS based on a novel partial cooperation overlaying scheme. Exploiting
the heterogeneous path gains between the private MSs and the common MSs, each
of the $K$ BSs serves a private MS non-cooperatively and the $K$ BSs also serve
the $M^c$ common MSs cooperatively. The proposed scheme does not require closed
loop instantaneous channel state information feedback, which is highly
desirable for high mobility users. Furthermore, we formulate the long-term
distributive power allocation problem between the private MSs and the common
MSs at each of the $K$ BSs using a partial cooperative game. We show that the
long-term power allocation game has a unique Nash Equilibrium (NE) but standard
best response update may not always converge to the NE. As a result, we propose
a low-complexity distributive long-term power allocation algorithm which only
relies on the local long-term channel statistics and has provable convergence
property. Through numerical simulations, we show that the proposed open-loop
SDMA scheme with long-term distributive power allocation can achieve
significant performance advantages over the other reference baseline schemes.

the interval time distribution from the perspective of individual dynamics and
group dynamics. Actually, this mixing feature can be attributed to the fitting
deviations as they are negligible for individual dynamics, but those of
different vendors are cumulated and then lead to an exponential factor for
group dynamics. To better describe the mechanism generating the heterogeneity

the neutrinos can obtain small masses through the type I seesaw mechanism in

several cases. They all are natural results due to the spontaneous breaking of
these charges. Some constraints on the new physics via flavor changing and

dark-energy with bizarre properties (repulsive-gravity). The question is that
whether Hubble's expansion is just due to the shock of big-bang & inflation or
it is due to the repulsive-gravity of dark-energy? Now, it is believed to be
due to dark-energy, say, by re-introducing the once-discarded
cosmological-constant $\Lambda$. In the present paper, it is shown that `the

bubbles using double-null simulations. False vacuum bubbles violate the null
energy condition and emit negative energy along the outgoing direction through
semi-classical effects. If there are a few collapsing false vacuum bubbles and
they emit negative energy to a certain region, then the region can be
approximated by a negative energy bath, which means the region is homogeneously
filled by negative energy. If a false vacuum bubble is generated in the
negative energy bath and the tension of the bubble effectively becomes negative
in the bath, then the bubble can expand and form an inflating bubble universe.
This scenario uses a set of assumptions different from those in previous
studies because it does not require tunneling to unbuildable bubbles.

reduction efforts to avoid dangerous climate change, the implications of
proposed reduction schemes in human development standards of developing
countries remain a matter of debate. We show the existence of a positive and
time-dependent correlation between the Human Development Index (HDI) and per
capita CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion. Employing this empirical
relation, extrapolating the HDI, and using three population scenarios, the
cumulative CO2 emissions necessary for developing countries to achieve
particular HDI thresholds are assessed following a Development As Usual
approach (DAU). If current demographic and development trends are maintained,
we estimate that by 2050 around 85% of the world's population will live in
countries with high HDI (above 0.8). In particular, 300Gt of cumulative CO2
emissions between 2000 and 2050 are estimated to be necessary for the
development of 104 developing countries in the year 2000. This value represents
between 20% to 30% of previously calculated CO2 budgets limiting global warming
to 2{\deg}C. These constraints and results are incorporated into a CO2
reduction framework involving four domains of climate action for individual
countries. The framework reserves a fair emission path for developing countries
to proceed with their development by indexing country-dependent reduction rates
proportional to the HDI in order to preserve the 2{\deg}C target after a
particular development threshold is reached. Under this approach, global
cumulative emissions by 2050 are estimated to range from 850 up to 1100Gt of
CO2. These values are within the uncertainty range of emissions to limit global
temperatures to 2{\deg}C.

examine the X-ray excess emission in this cluster reported earlier with the

gas depends strongly on the choice of the energy band used for the spectral
analysis. This proves the existence of excess emission component in addition to
the single-temperature MEKAL in A3112. We showed that this effect is not an
artifact due to uncertainties of the background modeling, instrument
calibration or the amount of Galactic absorption. Neither does the PSF scatter
of the emission from the cool core nor the projection of the cool gas in the
cluster outskirts produce the effect. Finally we modeled the excess emission
either by using an additional MEKAL or powerlaw component. Due to the small
differencies between thermal and non-thermal model we can not rule out the
non-thermal origin of the excess emission based on the goodness of the fit.
Assuming that it has a thermal origin, we further examined the Differential
Emission Measure (DEM) models. We utilised two different DEM models, a Gaussian
differential emission measure distribution (GDEM) and WDEM model, where the
emission measure of a number of thermal components is distributed as a
truncated power law. The best-fit XIS1 MEKAL temperature for the 0.4-7.0 keV

explain the present masses of the Galactic GCs. Our 3D hydrodynamical
simulations with star formation show that SG formed in the central regions of

amplitude of SG can depend strongly on the initial kinematics of FG. We thus
propose that some GCs composed of FG and SG had a significant amount of
rotation when they were formed. We also suggest that although later long-term
(~10 Gyr) dynamical evolution of stars can smooth out the initial structural

flattened structures and rotational kinematics of SG can be imprinted on shapes

Non-magnetic state as well as various magnetic orderings were considered, i.e.
ferromagnetic (FM) and more complex anti-parallel (called APM) arrangements for
selected sublattices, as follows from the symmetry analysis. It has been shown
that the Stoner criterion applied to non-magnetic density of states at the
Fermi energy, $E_F$ is satisfied for Fe atoms situated on all five lattice
sites, while it is not fulfilled for all Cr atoms. In FM and APM states, the
values of magnetic moments on Fe atoms occupying various sites are dispersed
between 0 and 2.5 $\mu_B$, and they are proportional to the number of Fe atoms
in the nearest-neighbor shell. Magnetic moments of Cr atoms havin much smaller
values were found to be coupled antiparallel to those of Fe atoms. The average
value of the magnetic moment per atom was found to be $<\mu>=0.55 \mu_B$ that
is by a factor of 4 larger than the experimental value found for a
$\sigma-$Fe$_{0.538}$Cr$_{0.462}$ sample. Conversely, admitting an anti-
parallel ordering (APM model) on atoms situated on C and D sites, according to
the group theory and symmetry analysis results, yielded a substantial reduction
of $<\mu>$ to 0.20 $\mu_B$. Further diminution of $<\mu>$ to 0.15 $\mu_B$,

axisymmetric flow while we always found a dynamo when non-axisymmetric
hydrodynamical instabilities are excited. Without rotation of the outer sphere,
typical critical magnetic Reynolds numbers $Rm_c$ are of the order of a few
thousands. They increase as the mechanical forcing imposed by the inner core on
the flow increases (Reynolds number $Re$). Namely, no dynamo is found if the
magnetic Prandtl number $Pm=Rm/Re$ is less than a critical value $Pm_c\sim 1$.
Oscillating quadrupolar dynamos are present in the vicinity of the dynamo
onset. Saturated magnetic fields obtained in supercritical regimes (either
$Re>2 Re_c$ or $Pm>2Pm_c$) correspond to the equipartition between magnetic and
kinetic energies. A global rotation of the system (Ekman numbers $E=10^{-3},
10^{-4}$) yields to a slight decrease (factor 2) of the critical magnetic
Prandtl number, but we find a peculiar regime where dynamo action may be
obtained for relatively low magnetic Reynolds numbers ($Rm_c\sim 300$). In this
dynamical regime (Rossby number $Ro\sim -1$, spheres in opposite direction) at
a moderate Ekman number ($E=10^{-3}$), a enhanced shear layer around the inner
core might explain the decrease of the dynamo threshold. For lower $E$
($E=10^{-4}$) this internal shear layer becomes unstable, leading to small
scales fluctuations, and the favorable dynamo regime is lost. We also model the
effect of ferromagnetic boundary conditions. Their presence have only a small
impact on the dynamo onset but clearly enhance the saturated magnetic field in
the ferromagnetic parts. Implications for experimental studies are discussed.

have completely different characteristics and are associated with different
kinds of ejections. One kind of emission has a flat or inverted spectrum
indicating optically thick self-absorbed synchrotron emission; the second kind
of emission corresponds to an optically thin ""transient"" outburst. The flat or
inverted spectrum covers the whole radio band and has been established also at
millimeter and infrared wavelengths. When this kind of radio emission is
spatially resolved it appears as a continuous jet, the so-called ""steady jet"".
In contrast, transient jets associated with optically thin events are resolved
as ""plasmoids"" moving at relativistic speeds away from the center of the
system. The most important point is that the two kinds of radio emission and
their corresponding types of ejections seem to be related to each other; the
optically thin outburst that characterizes the transient jet occurs after an
interval of emission with flat/inverted spectrum. Two different models
successfully describe the two jets: a conical flow and shocks. The conical
outflow describes the continuous jet and internal shocks in a continuous
pre-existing outflow describe the ""plasmoids"" of the transient jet. The
internal shocks in the outflow are thought to originate from a new population
of very fast particles. Three open issues are discussed: is magnetic
reconnection the physical process generating the new population of very fast
particles? Is that part of the continuous jet called ""core"" destroyed by the
transient jet and its associated shocks? Can we extrapolate these results from
steady and transient jets in X-ray binaries to radio loud AGNs?

recover significant cluster-centric radial stellar population gradients for the
passive sample in SSP-equivalent age, [Mg/Fe], [C/Fe] and [N/Fe]. These trends
are in the sense that, at fixed velocity dispersion, passive galaxies on the
outskirts of the cluster are 24% $\pm$ 9% younger with lower [Mg/Fe] and [N/Fe]

increase in cluster-centric radial stellar population gradients when fitting to
a passive galaxy subset selected to cover the cluster core and South-West
region, which contains the NGC 4839 subgroup. Thus we conclude that the NGC
4839 in-fall region is not unique, at least in terms of the stellar populations

convergence for estimating the covariance matrix under both the operator norm
and Frobenius norm. It is shown that optimal procedures under the two norms are
different and consequently matrix estimation under the operator norm is
fundamentally different from vector estimation. The minimax upper bound is
obtained by constructing a special class of tapering estimators and by studying
their risk properties. A key step in obtaining the optimal rate of convergence
is the derivation of the minimax lower bound. The technical analysis requires
new ideas that are quite different from those used in the more conventional

five frequency setups aimed at groups of lines from the following molecules:
CH3OH, H2CO, and CH3CN. Using the LTE approximation, temperatures, source
sizes, and column densities were determined through modeling of synthetic

functions of E and of the spacetime dimensionality D=n+2 for n=2,...,9 (in some
cases we go up to 11). We find that the total energy radiated increases with n
for particles falling from rest (E=1). For fixed particle energies 1<E<=2 we
show explicitly that the radiation has a local minimum at some critical value
of n, and then it increases with n. We conjecture that such a minimum exists
also for higher particle energies. The present point-particle calculation
breaks down when n=11, because then the radiated energy becomes larger than the
particle mass. Quite interestingly, for n=11 the radiated energy predicted by
our calculation would also violate Hawking's area bound. This hints at a
qualitative change in gravitational radiation emission for n>11. Our results
are in very good agreement with numerical simulations of low-energy,
unequal-mass black hole collisions in D=5 (that will be reported elsewhere) and
they are a useful benchmark for future nonlinear evolutions of the

were well represented by a two-temperature thermal model for the interstellar
medium (ISM) plus a power-law model. The cool and hot temperatures of the
thermal model were 0.48 +/- 0.03 and 0.92 +/- 0.04 keV, respectively. The
excellent spectral sensitivity of Suzaku enables for the first time to measure
the metal abundances of O, Ne, Mg, Si, and Fe in the ISM. The resultant
abundance pattern of O, Ne, Mg, Si, and Fe is close to that of the new solar
abundance determined by Lodders (2003). The measured abundance pattern is
compared with those of elliptical galaxies and an S0 galaxy, observed with
Suzaku. Considering the metal-enrichment from present Type Ia supernovae, the

[Fe/H]=-1.10+-0.01 dex, with no systematic offsets between dwarf and giant

additional turbulent mixing below the convective region needs to be taken into
account,able to inhibit the atomic diffusion.The measured A(Li) and its
homogeneity in the TO stars allow to put strong constraints on the shape of the
Li profile inside the M4 TO stars. The global behaviour of A(Li) with T_{eff}
can be reproduced with different pristine Li abundances, depending on the kind
of adopted turbulent mixing.One cannot reproduce the global trend starting from
the WMAP+BBNS A(Li) and adopting the turbulent mixing described by Richard et
al.(2005) with the same efficiency used by Korn et al.(2006) to explain the Li
content in NGC6397. Such a solution is not able to well reproduce
simultaneously the Li abundance observed in TO and RGB stars.Otherwise,
theWMAP+BBNS A(Li) can be reproduced assuming a more efficient turbulent mixing
able to reach deeper stellar regions where the Li is burned. The cosmological
Li discrepancy cannot be easily solved with the present,poor understanding of
the turbulence in the stellar interiors and a future effort to well understand
the true nature of this non-canonical process is needed.

differential rotation of intermediate-mass stars which may evolve into Ap
stars. We report on simulations of the interplay of differential rotation and
magnetic fields, the stability limits and non-linear evolution of such
configurations, and the prospects of dynamo action from the unstable cases. The
axisymmetric problem delivers a balance between field amplification and
back-reaction of the magnetic field on the differential rotation. The
non-axisymmetric case involves also the Tayler instability of the amplified
toroidal fields. We consider limits for field amplification and apply these to
young A stars. Apart from its application to Ap stars, the instability is
scrutinized for the fundamental possibility of a dynamo. We are not looking for
a dynamo as an explanation for the Ap star phenomenon. The kinetic helicity is
concentrated near the tangent cylinder of the inner sphere of the computational
domain and is negative in the northern hemisphere. This appears to be a
ubiquitous effect not special to the Tayler instability. The latter is actually
connected with a positive current helicity in the bulk of the spherical shell

response-adaptive randomization (RAR) procedures (by changing randomization

procedure sequentially) have been proposed to achieve these objectives to some
degree. In this paper, we propose to sequentially monitor response-adaptive
randomized clinical trial and study it's properties. We prove that the
sequential test statistics of the new procedure converge to a Brownian motion
in distribution. Further, we show that the sequential test statistics
asymptotically satisfy the canonical joint distribution defined in Jennison and
Turnbull (\citeyearJT00). Therefore, type I error and other objectives can be
achieved theoretically by selecting appropriate boundaries. These results open
a door to sequentially monitor response-adaptive randomized clinical trials in
practice. We can also observe from the simulation studies that, the proposed
procedure brings together the advantages of both techniques, in dealing with
power, total sample size and total failure numbers, while keeps the type I
error. In addition, we illustrate the characteristics of the proposed procedure
by redesigning a well-known clinical trial of maternal-infant HIV transmission.

the avalanche. Our calculations revealed that all three quantities are
characterized by power law distributions with universal exponents. We show by
analytical calculations and computer simulations that varying the amount of
disorder of slip thresholds and the number of allowed slips of fibers, the
system exhibits a disorder induced phase transition from a phase where only
small avalanches are formed to another one where a macroscopic slip appears.

relativistic coupled-channel formalism in order to take the dynamics of the
mesonic degrees of freedom fully into account. It is demonstrated that the mass
eigenvalue problem for such a system can be reformulated as a purely hadronic
eigenvalue problem in which bare hadrons, i.e. eigenstates of the pure
confinement problem, are coupled via meson loops. The substructure of the bare
hadrons is then hidden in (bare) hadron-meson vertex form factors. It is shown
for a simple toy model that such a kind of approach may lead to reasonable

a fixed value which correctly describes the bonding at the defect centre. Our

spectrometer at the ESO 3.6m-telescope, we obtained high-quality circular
polarization spectra of 41 single and double HgMn stars. Using a multi-line
analysis technique on each star, we co-added information from hundreds of
spectral lines resulting in significantly greater sensitivity to the presence
of magnetic fields, including very weak fields. For the 47 individual objects
studied, including 6 components of SB2 systems, we do not detect any magnetic
fields at greater than the 3 sigma level. The lack of detection in the circular
polarization profiles indicates that if strong fields are present on these
stars, they must have complex surface topologies. For simple global fields, our
detection limits imply upper limits to the fields present of 2-10 Gauss in the
best cases. We conclude that HgMn stars lack large-scale magnetic fields,
typical for spotted magnetic Ap stars, sufficient to form and sustain the
chemical spots observed on HgMn stars. Our study confirms that in addition to
magnetically altered atomic diffusion, there exists another differentiation
mechanism operating in the atmospheres of late-B main sequence stars which can
compositional inhomogeneities on their surfaces.

by factorizing an observation matrix that collects 2-D projections of features.
These methods became popular due to their robustness - they use a large number
of views, which constrains adequately the solution - and computational
simplicity - the large number of unknowns is computed through an SVD, avoiding
non-linear optimization. However, they require that all the entries of the
observation matrix are known. This is unlikely to happen in practice, due to
self-occlusion and limited field of view. Also, when processing long videos,
regions that become occluded often appear again later. Current factorization
methods process these as new regions, leading to less accurate estimates of 3-D
structure. In this paper, we propose a global factorization method that infers
complete 3-D models directly from the 2-D projections in the entire set of
available video frames. Our method decides whether a region that has become
visible is a region that was seen before, or a previously unseen region, in a
global way, i.e., by seeking the simplest rigid object that describes well the
entire set of observations. This global approach increases significantly the
accuracy of the estimates of the 3-D shape of the scene and the 3-D motion of
the camera. Experiments with artificial and real videos illustrate the good
performance of our method.

for d=2, and as e^{-\lambda_d t} for d>= 3, where \lambda_1 and \lambda_2 can

probability is what is known in the physics literature as the Pascal principle,
which asserts that the annealed survival probability is maximized if the random

expected cardinality of the range of a continuous time symmetric random walk
increases under perturbation by a deterministic path.

we show that the usual Lorenz gauge-breaking term now plays the role of an
effective electromagnetic current. Such a current is generated during inflation
from quantum fluctuations and gives rise to a stochastic effective charge
density distribution. Due to the high electric conductivity of the cosmic
plasma after inflation, the electric charge density generates currents which
give rise to both vorticity and magnetic fields on sub-Hubble scales. Present
upper limits on vorticity coming from temperature anisotropies of the CMB are
translated into lower limits on the present value of cosmic magnetic fields. We
find that, for a nearly scale invariant vorticity spectrum, magnetic fields
$B_{\lambda}> 10^{-12}$ G are typically generated with coherence lengths
ranging from sub-galactic scales up to the present Hubble radius. Those fields
could act as seeds for a galactic dynamo or even account for observations just

scale are easily taken care of by removing the mean and normalizing the energy.
However, defining and computing the orientation of a 2D shape is not so simple.
In fact, although for elongated shapes the principal axis can be used to define
one of two possible orientations, there is no such tool for general shapes. As
we show in the paper, previous approaches fail to compute the orientation of
even noiseless observations of simple shapes. We address this problem. In the
paper, we show how to uniquely define the orientation of an arbitrary 2D shape,
in terms of what we call its Principal Moments. We show that a small subset of
these moments suffice to represent the underlying 2D shape and propose a new
method to efficiently compute the shape orientation: Principal Moment Analysis.
Finally, we discuss how this method can further be applied to normalize
grey-level images. Besides the theoretical proof of correctness, we describe
experiments demonstrating robustness to noise and illustrating the method with
real images.

fabrication of negative index metamaterials in the near-infrared wavelength
range. In particular, we investigated a specific implementation of the widely
studied double fishnet metamaterials, consisting of a gold-silica-gold layer
stack perforated by a hexagonal array of round holes. Tuning of the hole
diameter allows us to tailor these self-assembled metamaterials both as single-
({\epsilon} < 0) and double ({\epsilon} < 0 and {\mu} < 0) negative
metamaterials.
