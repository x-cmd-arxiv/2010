  parameter","17 pages",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Unification-type idea of a basic connection between particle mass and charge
quantities is in the spirit of string theory. On the level of phenomenology,
this idea means raison d'etre for particle flavor since it requires more than
one mass copy i.e. transition from individual particle mass to the concept of
mass-matrix. In this paper that idea is exemplified by a generic system of
accurate empirical relations for dimensionless flavor-electroweak quantities
(fine structure constant, muon-electron and tauon-electron mass ratios and
quark CKM and neutrino PMNS mixing angles) build in terms of one small
universal e-parameter as mediator of mass-matrix and charge quantities. The
used in this study empirically suggested math paradigm consists of repeated
exponentiation of e-powers. Accuracy boost of flavor relations from replacement
of e-power terms by exponential f-terms is observed. The two widely discussed
in the literature empirical flavor regularities, quark-lepton complementarity
(QLC) and Koide charged lepton mass formula, are essential parts of the generic
system. Solar neutrino mixing angle is predicted {\theta}sol= 34.05o by
extension of QLC. Charged lepton mass ratios satisfy Koide relation with high
accuracy ~10-9. The Appendix contains comments on dual objective-anthropic
nature of physical reality.

properties of the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM) modify the heliosphere
and modulate the flux of galactic cosmic rays (GCR) at the surface of the
Earth, with consequences for the terrestrial record of cosmogenic
radionuclides. One phenomenon that needs studying is the effect on cosmogenic
isotope production of changing anomalous cosmic ray fluxes at Earth due to
variable interstellar ionizations. The possible range of interstellar ram
pressures and ionization levels in the low density solar environment generate
dramatically different possible heliosphere configurations, with a wide range
of particle fluxes of interstellar neutrals, their secondary products, and GCRs
arriving at Earth. Simple models of the distribution and densities of ISM in
the downwind direction give cloud transition timescales that can be directly
compared with cosmogenic radionuclide geologic records. Both the interstellar
data and cosmogenic radionuclide data are consistent with cloud transitions
during the Holocene, with large and assumption-dependent uncertainties. The
geomagnetic timeline derived from cosmic ray fluxes at Earth may require
adjustment to account for the disappearance of anomalous cosmic rays when the
Sun is immersed in ionized gas.

fall outside the established classification of topological insulators. These
insulators are not required to have gapless boundary modes in the energy
spectrum. However, they do exhibit protected modes in the entanglement spectrum
localized on the cut between two entangled regions. Their entanglement entropy
cannot be made to vanish adiabatically, and hence the insulators can be called
topological. There is a direct connection between the inversion eigenvalues of
the band structure and the mid-gap states in the entanglement spectrum. The
classification of protected entanglement levels is given by an integer $n\in
Z$, which is the difference between the negative inversion eigenvalues at
inversion symmetric points in the Brillouin zone, taken in sets of two. When
the Hamiltonian describes a Chern insulator or a non-trivial T-invariant
topological insulator, the entanglement spectrum exhibits spectral flow. If the
Chern number is zero for the former, or T is broken in the latter, the
entanglement spectrum does \emph{not} have spectral flow, but, depending on the
inversion eigenvalues, can still have protected midgap bands. Although spectral
flow is broken, the mid-gap entanglement bands cannot be adiabatically removed,
and the insulator is `topological.' In 1D, we establish a link between the
product of the inversion eigenvalues of all occupied bands at all inversion
momenta and charge polarization. In 2D, we prove a link between the product of
the inversion eigenvalues and the parity of the Chern number. In 3D, we find a
topological constraint on the product of the inversion eigenvalues indicating

survival, and yet are processes implemented by non-ideal biological building
blocks which can impose significant error. We explore quantitatively how the
brain might cope with this inherent source of error by taking advantage of two
ubiquitous mechanisms, redundancy and synchronization. In particular we
consider a neural process whose goal is to learn a decision function by
implementing a nonlinear gradient dynamics. The dynamics, however, are assumed
to be corrupted by perturbations modeling the error which might be incurred due
to limitations of the biology, intrinsic neuronal noise, and imperfect
measurements. We show that error, and the associated uncertainty surrounding a
learned solution, can be controlled in large part by trading off
synchronization strength among multiple redundant neural systems against the
noise amplitude. The impact of the coupling between such redundant systems is
quantified by the spectrum of the network Laplacian, and we discuss the role of
network topology in synchronization and in reducing the effect of noise. A
range of situations in which the mechanisms we model arise in brain science are
discussed, and we draw attention to experimental evidence suggesting that
cortical circuits capable of implementing the computations of interest here can
be found on several scales. Finally, simulations comparing theoretical bounds
to the relevant empirical quantities show that the theoretical estimates we
derive can be tight.

ground state of a magnetic nanodisk whose magnetic moments interact via
dipole-dipole potential?. In this work it is investigated the conditions for
the formation of vortices in nanodisks in triangular, square, and hexagonal
lattices as a function of the size of the lattice and of the strength of the
dipole interaction D. Our results show that there is a ""transition"" line
separating the vortex state from a capacitor like state. This line has a finite
size scaling form depending on the size, L, of the system as Dc=D0
+1/A(?1+B*L^2)?. This behavior is obeyed by the three types of lattices. Inside
the vortex phase it is possible to identify two types of vortices separated by
a constant, D=Dc, line: An in-plane and an out-of-plane vortex. We observed
that the out-of-plane phase does not appear for the triangular lattice. In a
two layer system the extra layer of dipoles works as an effective out-of-plane
anisotropy inducing a large S^z component at the center of the vortex. Also, we
analyzed the mechanism for switching the out-of-plane vortex component.
Contrary to some reported results, we found evidences that the mechanism is not
a creation-annihilation vortex anti-vortex process.

traditionally been solved using the ""spectral technique"". These problems
include the normalized cut problem, the graph expander ratio problem, the
Cheeger constant problem and the conductance problem. These problems share
several common features: all seek a bipartition of a set of elements; the
problems are formulated as a form of ratio cut; the formulation as discrete
optimization is shown here to be equivalent to a quadratic ratio, sometimes
referred to as the Raleigh ratio, on discrete variables and a single sum
constraint which we call the balance or orthogonality constraint; when the
discrete nature of the variables is disregarded, the continuous relaxation is
solved by the spectral method. Indeed the spectral relaxation technique is a
dominant method providing an approximate solution to these problems.
  We propose an algorithm for these problems which involves a relaxation of the
orthogonality constraint only. This relaxation is shown here to be solved
optimally, and in strongly polynomial time, in O(mn log((n^2) / m) for a graph
on $n$ nodes and $m$ edges. The algorithm, using HPF (Hochbaum's Pseudo-Flow)
as subroutine, is efficient enough to be used to solve these bi-partitioning
problems on millions of elements and more than 300 million edges within less
than 10 minutes. It is also demonstrated, via a preliminary experimental study,
that the results of the combinatorial algorithm proposed often improve
dramatically on the quality of the results of the spectral method.

between two parallel slabs using a constant magnetic field. The torque is
calculated using the Barash theory of dispersive torques. In III-IV
semiconductors such as $InSb$, the effect of an external magnetic field is to
induce an optical anisotropy, in an otherwise isotropic material, that will in
turn induce a torque.
  The calculations of the torque are done in the Voigt configuration, with the
magnetic field parallel to the surface of the slabs. As a case study we
consider a slab made of calcite and a second slab made of $InSb$. In the
absence of magnetic field there is no torque. As the magnetic field increases,
the optical anisotropy of $InSb$ increases and the torque becomes different
from zero, increasing with the magnetic field. The resulting torque is of the

illustration of the use of the consistent machinery presented in this review,
we carry out a multipole analysis of the gamma p -> K^+ Lambda reaction and
examine the impact of recently published polarization measurements. In fitting
multipoles, we use a combined Monte Carlo sampling of the amplitude space, with
gradient minimization, and find a shallow chi^2 valley pitted with a very large
number of local minima. This results in broad bands of multipole solutions that
are experimentally indistinguishable. While these bands have been noticeably
narrowed by the inclusion of new polarization measurements, many of the
multipoles remain very poorly determined, even in sign, despite the inclusion
of data on 8 different observables. We have compared multipoles from recent PWA
codes with our model-independent solution bands. The potential accuracy of
amplitudes that could be extracted from measurements of all 16 polarization
observables has been studied with mock data using the statistical variations

(non-conforming) mixed finite element methods. The crux of the analysis is to
establish a generalized {\em inf-sup} condition, which holds without any mesh
constraint, for each LDG method. The generalized {\em inf-sup} conditions then
easily infer the desired absolute stability of the proposed LDG methods. In
return, the stability results not only guarantee the well-posedness of the LDG

qualitative agreement with a simple stellar population model of the Kepler

characterized by M ~> 2 M_sun and nu_max ~ 40-110 muHz. We measured the small

nu_03 in over 40. We present C-D diagrams for l=1, 2 and 3 and show that the
frequency separation ratios delta nu_02/Delta nu and delta nu_01/Delta nu have
opposite trends as a function of Delta nu. The data show a narrowing of the l=1
ridge towards lower nu_max, in agreement with models predicting more efficient
mode trapping in stars with higher luminosity. We investigate the offset
epsilon in the asymptotic relation and find a clear correlation with Delta nu,
demonstrating that it is related to fundamental stellar parameters. Finally, we
present the first amplitude-nu_max relation for Kepler red giants. We observe a

flux-calibrated, hence not tied anymore to the Lick/IDS system. This is
essential for the interpretation of galaxy spectra where calibration stars are
not available, such as large galaxy redshift surveys or other high-redshift

SDSS resolution, so that our models can be applied to SDSS data without any

larger ages than CMD determinations mostly for metal-rich globular clusters.
The metallicities agree well with literature values on the Zinn & West scale,
if we adopt iron abundance [Fe/H] for those clusters whose ages agree with the
CMD ages. It turns out that the derivation of individual element abundance
ratios is not reliable at [Fe/H]<-1 dex, while the [alpha/Fe] ratio is robust
at all metallicities. We find general enhancement of light and alpha elements,
as expected, with significant variations for some elements. The elements O and
Mg follow the same general enhancement with almost identical distributions of
[O/Fe] and [Mg/Fe]. We obtain slightly lower [C/Fe] and very high [N/Fe]
ratios, instead. This chemical anomaly, commonly attributed to self-enrichment,
is well known in globular clusters from individual stellar spectroscopy. It is
the first time that this pattern is obtained also from the integrated light.
The alpha elements follow a pattern such that the heavier elements Ca and Ti
are less enhanced. More specifically, the [Ca/Fe] and [Ti/Fe] ratios are lower
than [O/Fe] and [Mg/Fe] by about 0.2 dex. This trend is also seen in recent
determinations of element abundances in globular cluster and field stars of the
Milky Way. This suggests that Type Ia supernovae contribute significantly to
the enrichment of the heavier alpha elements as predicted by nucleosynthesis
calculations and galactic chemical evolution models.

theories in terms of building blocks of dual open strings. In the specific case
where the open string is given by a matrix model these blocks correspond to a
choice of integration contour. We then apply this definition to the AGT setup
where the dual matrix model has logarithmic potential and is conjecturally
equivalent to Liouville conformal field theory. By studying the natural
contours of these matrix integrals and their monodromy properties, we propose a
precise map between topological string blocks and Liouville conformal blocks.
Remarkably, this description makes use of the light-cone diagrams of closed
string field theory, where the critical points of the matrix potential
correspond to string interaction points.

degeneracies between thermal inversions and molecular abundances in four highly
irradiated hot Jupiter atmospheres, day-side observations of which were
previously reported to be consistent with thermal inversions based on Spitzer
photometry. The four systems are: HD 209458b, HAT-P-7b, TrES-4, and TrES-2. For

thermal inversions, and with a wide range in chemical composition. On the other
hand, observations of HD 209458b and HAT-P-7b are better fit with thermal
inversions than without, as has been reported before. We do not see a

explore this issue further in two canonical models for quantum criticality,
with particular attention paid to the potential effects beyond hyperscaling. In
the case of a one-dimensional transverse field Ising model, we derive the
specific scaling form of the free energy. It follows from this scaling form
that the singular temperature dependence at the critical field has a vanishing
prefactor but the singular field dependence at zero temperature is realized.
For the spin-density-wave model above its upper critical dimension, we show
that the dangerously irrelevant quartic coupling comes into the free energy in
a delicate way but in the end yields only subleading contributions beyond
hyperscaling. We conclude that entropy accumulation near quantum critical point

a folded string with a spin S in AdS_5 and an angular momentum J in S^5, in the
scaling limit of large J and S with ell=pi J/(lambda^(1/2) ln S)=fixed. We
compute the generalized scaling function at two-loop order f_2(ell) both for
small and large values of ell matching the predictions based on the asymptotic
Bethe ansatz. In particular, in the small ell expansion, we derive an exact
integral form for the ell-dependent coefficient of the Catalan's constant term
in f_2(ell). Also, by resumming a certain subclass of multi-loop Feynman
diagrams we obtain an exact expression for the leading (ln ell) part of
f(lambda^(1/2), ell) which is valid to any order in the alpha'~1/lambda^(1/2)
expansion. At large ell the string energy has a BMN-like expansion and the
first few leading coefficients are expected to be the same at weak and at
strong coupling. We provide a new example of this non-renormalization for the
term which is generated at two loops in string theory and at one-loop in gauge
theory (sub-sub-leading in 1/J). We also derive a simple algebraic formula for
the term of maximal transcendentality in f_2(ell) expanded at large ell. In the
second part of the paper we initiate the study of 2-loop finite size
corrections to the string energy by formally compactifying the spatial
world-sheet direction in the string action expanded near long fast-spinning
string. We observe that the leading finite-size corrections are of ""Casimir""
type coming from terms containing at least one massless propagator. We consider
in detail the one-loop order (reproducing the leading Landau-Lifshitz model
prediction) and then focus on the two-loop contributions to the (1/ln S) term
(for J=0). We find that in a certain regularization scheme used to discard
power divergences the two-loop coefficient of the (1/ln S) term appears to
vanish.

Fabry-Perot interferometer, exploring the roles of the Aharonov-Bohm effect,
Coulomb interactions, and fractional statistics on the oscillations of the
resistance as one varies the magnetic field B and/or the voltage V_G applied to
a side gate. Coulomb interactions couple the interfering edge mode to localized
quasiparticle states in the bulk, whose occupation is quantized in integer
values. For the integer quantum Hall effect, if the bulk-edge coupling is
absent, the resistance exhibits an Aharonov-Bohm (AB) periodicity, where the
phase is equal to the number of quanta of magnetic flux enclosed by a specified
interferometer area. When bulk-edge coupling is present, the actual area of the
interferometer oscillates as function of B and V_G, with a combination of a
smooth variation and abrupt jumps due to changes in the number of
quasi-particles in the bulk of the interferometer. This modulates the
Aharonov-Bohm phase and gives rise to additional periodicities in the
resistance. In the limit of strong interactions, the amplitude of the AB
oscillations becomes negligible, and one sees only the new ""Coulomb-dominated""
(CD) periodicity. In the limits where either the AB or the CD periodicities
dominate, a color map of resistance will show a series of parallel stripes in
the B-V_G plane, but the two cases show different stripe spacings and slopes of
opposite signs. At intermediate coupling, one sees a superposition of the two
patterns. We discuss the dependence of the interference intensities on
parameters including the temperature and the backscattering strengths of the
individual constrictions. We also discuss how results are modified in a
fractional quantized Hall system, and the extent to which the interferometer
may demonstrate the fractional statistics of the quasiparticles.

identities are captured and extended by a single identity, due to Schoen in
1988. In each of the three cases the identity requires and involves an
infinitesimal conformal symmetry. For structures with such a conformal vector
field, we develop a very wide, and essentially complete, extension of this
picture. Any conformally variational natural scalar invariant is shown to
satisfy a Kazdan-Warner type identity, and a similar result holds for scalars
that are the trace of a locally conserved 2-tensor. Scalars of the latter type
are also seen to satisfy a Pohozaev-Schoen type identity on manifolds with

unified through the study of total and conformal variational theory, and in
particular the gauge invariances of the functionals concerned. Our

The same phenomenon is expected at a longer time scale when the light of remote
stars crosses an interstellar molecular cloud, but it has never been observed
at optical wavelength. In a favorable case, the light of a background star can
be subject to stochastic fluctuations on the order of a few percent at a
characteristic time scale of a few minutes. Our ultimate aim is to discover or
exclude these scintillation effects to estimate the contribution of molecular
hydrogen to the Galactic baryonic hidden mass. This feasibility study is a
pathfinder toward an observational strategy to search for scintillation,
probing the sensitivity of future surveys and estimating the background level.
Methods: We searched for scintillation induced by molecular gas in visible dark
nebulae as well as by hypothetical halo clumpuscules of cool molecular hydrogen
($\mathrm{H_2-He}$) during two nights. We took long series of 10s infrared
exposures with the ESO-NTT telescope toward stellar populations located behind
visible nebulae and toward the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). We therefore
searched for stars exhibiting stochastic flux variations similar to what is
expected from the scintillation effect. According to our simulations of the
scintillation process, this search should allow one to detect (stochastic)
transverse gradients of column density in cool Galactic molecular clouds of
order of $\sim 3\times 10^{-5}\,\mathrm{g/cm^2/10\,000\,km}$. Results: We found
one light-curve that is compatible with a strong scintillation effect through a
turbulent structure characterized by a diffusion radius $R_{diff}<100\, km$ in
the B68 nebula. Complementary observations are needed to clarify the status of
this candidate, and no firm conclusion can be established from this single
observation. We can also infer limits on the existence of turbulent dense cores
(of number density $n>10^9\, cm^{-3}$) within the dark nebulae. Because no
candidate is found toward the SMC, we are also able to establish upper limits
on the contribution of gas clumpuscules to the Galactic halo mass. Conclusions:
The limits set by this test do not seriously constrain the known models, but we
show that the short time-scale monitoring for a few $10^6 star\times hour$ in
the visible band with a $>4$ meter telescope and a fast readout camera should
allow one to quantify the contribution of turbulent molecular gas to the
Galactic halo. The LSST (Large Synoptic Survey Telescope) is perfectly suited
for this search.

suddenly at some unknown and unobservable disorder time. The objective is to
detect this change as quickly as possible after it happens. Earlier work on the
Bayesian formulation of this problem brings optimal (or asymptotically optimal)
detection rules assuming that the prior distribution of the change time is
given at time zero, and additional information is received by observing the
Wiener process only. Here, we consider a different information structure where
possible causes of this disorder are observed. More precisely, we assume that
we also observe an arrival/counting process representing external shocks. The
disorder happens because of these shocks, and the change time coincides with
one of the arrival times. Such a formulation arises, for example, from
detecting a change in financial data caused by major financial events, or
detecting damages in structures caused by earthquakes. In this paper, we
formulate the problem in a Bayesian framework assuming that those observable
shocks form a Poisson process. We present an optimal detection rule that
minimizes a linear Bayes risk, which includes the expected detection delay and
the probability of early false alarms. We also give the solution of the
``variational formulation'' where the objective is to minimize the detection
delay over all stopping rules for which the false alarm probability does not
exceed a given constant.

initially wound around each other in a double-helical conformation and evolve
through Rouse dynamics. The problem relates to quickly bringing a
double-stranded polymer well above its melting temperature, i.e., the binding
interactions between the strands are neglected, and the strands separate from
each other as it is entropically favorable for them to do so. The strands
unwind by rotating around each other until they separate. We find that the
process proceeds from the ends inward; intermediate conformations can be
characterized by a tightly wound inner part, from which loose strands are
sticking out, with length l~t^0.39. The total time needed for the two strands
to unwind scales as a power of N as tu~N^(2.57+-0.03). We present a theoretical
argument, which suggests that during this unwinding process, these loose
strands are far out of equilibrium.

which to set new constraints on models of neutron-capture processes at low

HD221170, show an overabundance of the heavier neutron-capture elements and
excesses of lighter neutron-capture elements. The study of these r-rich stars
could give us a better understanding of weak and main r-process nucleosynthesis
at low metallicity. Based on conclusions from the observation of metal-poor
stars and neutron-capture element nucleosynthesis theory, we set up a model to
determine the relative contributions from weak and main r-processes to the
heavy-element abundances in metal-poor stars. Using this model, we find that
the abundance patterns of light elements for most sample stars are close to the
pattern of weak r-process stars, and those of heavier neutron-capture elements
very similar to the pattern of main r-process stars, while the lighter
neutron-capture elements can be fitted by the mixing of weak and main r-process
material. The production of weak r-process elements appears to be associated
with the light elements, while the production of main r-process elements is
almost decoupled from that of the light elements. We compare our results with
the observed data at low metallicities, showing that the predicted trends are
in good agreement with the observed trends, at least for the metallicity range

the inhomogeneity is created by an external field. Transforming the Vlasov
equation into action-angle variables, we derive a dispersion relation that we
accomplish to solve for both the growth rate of the instability and the

with the rapidly declining costs of the commercial panels, the generally low

conventional micro-canonical ensemble as a starting point for deriving

and practical questions unanswered. Here we discuss these questions, thereby
motivating the study of a natural alternative known as Quantum Micro-Canonical
(QMC) ensemble. We present a detailed numerical study of the properties of the
QMC ensemble for finite quantum systems revealing a good agreement with the
existing analytical results for large quantum systems. We also propose the way
to introduce analytical corrections accounting for finite-size effects. With
the above corrections, the agreement between the analytical and the numerical
results becomes very accurate. The QMC ensemble leads to an unconventional kind
of equilibrium, which may be realizable after strong perturbations in small
isolated quantum systems having large number of levels. We demonstrate that the
variance of energy fluctuations can be used to discriminate the QMC equilibrium
from the BG equilibrium. We further suggest that the reason, why BG equilibrium
commonly occurs in nature rather than the QMC-type equilibrium, has something
to do with the notion of quantum collapse.

Many treatments of the problem consider only a simple ``island'' model of

structure and cryptic relatedness as different aspects of a single confounder:
the unobserved pedigree defining the (often distant) relationships among the
study subjects. Kinship is therefore a central concept, and we review methods
of defining and estimating kinship coefficients, both pedigree-based and
marker-based. In this unified framework we review solutions to the problem of
population structure, including family-based study designs, genomic control,
structured association, regression control, principal components adjustment and
linear mixed models. The last solution makes the most explicit use of the
kinships among the study subjects, and has an established role in the analysis
of animal and plant breeding studies. Recent computational developments mean
that analyses of human genetic association data are beginning to benefit from
its powerful tests for association, which protect against population structure
and cryptic kinship, as well as intermediate levels of confounding by the
pedigree.

approximate mapping procedure to determine the spectral density of the
effective bath is given. Specifically, within a linear response approximation
the effective spectral density is given by the knowledge of the linear
susceptibility of the nonlinear quantum oscillator. To determine the actual
form of the susceptibility, we consider its periodically driven counterpart,
the problem of the quantum Duffing oscillator within linear response theory in
the driving amplitude. Knowing the effective spectral density, the qubit
dynamics is investigated. In particular, an analytic formula for the qubit's
population difference is derived. Within the regime of validity of our theory,
a very good agreement is found with predictions obtained from a Bloch-Redfield
master equation approach applied to the composite qubit-nonlinear oscillator
system.

nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) are measured on several thousand samples, are
quickly becoming a common type of study for identifying genetic factors
associated with many phenotypes. There is a strong assumption that interactions
between SNPs or genes and interactions between genes and environmental factors
substantially contribute to the genetic risk of a disease. Identification of
such interactions could potentially lead to increased understanding about
disease mechanisms; drug $\times$ gene interactions could have profound
applications for personalized medicine; strong interaction effects could be
beneficial for risk prediction models. In this paper we provide an overview of
different approaches to model interactions, emphasizing approaches that make
specific use of the structure of genetic data, and those that make specific
modeling assumptions that may (or may not) be reasonable to make. We conclude
that to identify interactions it is often necessary to do some selection of
SNPs, for example, based on prior hypothesis or marginal significance, but that
to identify SNPs that are marginally associated with a disease it may also be
useful to consider larger numbers of interactions.

all the Pareto-optimal rate tuples in the (discretized) outage-constrained
achievable rate region, this approach, however, suffers from a prohibitive
computational complexity and is feasible only when the number of

Belousov-Zhabotinsky medium exhibits various regimes of excitability depending
on the levels of illumination. For certain values of illumination the medium
switches to a sub-excitable mode. An asymmetric perturbation of the medium
leads to formation of a travelling localized excitation, a wave-fragment which
moves along a predetermined trajectory, ideally preserving its shape and
velocity. To implement collision-based computing with such wave-fragments we
represent values of Boolean variables in presence/absence of a wave-fragment at
specific sites of medium. When two wave-fragments collide they either
annihilate, or form new wave-fragments. The trajectories of the wave-fragments
after the collision represent a result of the computation, e.g. a simple
logical gate. Wave-fragments in the sub-excitable medium are famously difficult
to control. Therefore, we adopted a hybrid procedure in order to construct
collision-based logical gates: we used channels, defined by lower levels
illumination to subtly tune the shape of a propagating wave-fragment and allow
the wave-fragments to collide at the junctions between channels. Using this
methodology we were able to implement both in theoretical models (using the
Oregonator) and in experiment two interaction-based logical gates and assemble
the gates into a basic one-bit binary adder. We present the first ever
experimental approach towards constructing arithmetical circuits in
spatially-extended excitable chemical systems.

spread along the red giant branch (RGB) of some globular clusters (GC) that
appears only when color indices including a near ultraviolet band (such as
Johnson U or Stromgren u) are considered. This anomalous spread in color
indexes such as U-B or c_{y} has been shown to correlate with variations in the
abundances of light elements such as C, N, O, Na, etc., which, in turn, are
generally believed to be associated with subsequent star formation episodes
that occurred in the earliest few 10^{8} yr of the cluster's life. Here we use
publicly available u, g, r Sloan Digital Sky Survey photometry to search for
anomalous u-g spreads in the RGBs of nine Galactic GCs. In seven of them (M 2,
M 3, M 5, M 13, M 15, M 92 and M 53), we find evidence of a statistically
significant spread in the u-g color, not seen in g-r and not accounted for by
observational effects. In the case of M 5, we demonstrate that the observed u-g
color spread correlates with the observed abundances of Na, the redder stars
being richer in Na than the bluer ones. In all the seven clusters displaying a
significant u-g color spread, we find that the stars on the red and blue sides
of the RGB, in (g, u-g) color magnitude diagrams, have significantly different
radial distributions. In particular, the red stars (generally identified with
the second generation of cluster stars, in the current scenario) are always
more centrally concentrated than blue stars (generally identified with the
first generation) over the range sampled by the data (0.5r_{h} < r < 5r_{h}),
in qualitative agreement with the predictions of some recent models of the
formation and chemical evolution of GCs. Our results suggest that the
difference in the radial distribution between first and second generation stars
may be a general characteristic of GCs.

darkest ultrafaint dwarf galaxy currently measured. Spectral analysis of the
Swift XRT data fails to find any non-instrumental spectral feature possibly
connected with the radiative decay of a dark matter particle. Accordingly, we
establish upper bounds on the sterile neutrino parameter space based on the
non-detection of emission lines in the spectrum. The present work provides the
most sensitive X-ray search for sterile neutrinos in a region with the highest
dark matter density yet measured.

as radiation of various types and radiates heat as a black-body, and an inner
part that just dissipates heat at a constant rate. The resulting system of two
nonlinear ordinary differential equations for the satellite's temperatures is
analyzed with various methods, which prove that the temperatures approach a
steady state if the heat input is constant, whereas they approach a limit cycle

highly dependent on the pointing position of the telescope and about 4% at

angle offset of the half-wave plate that affects the calibration of NACO data
taken before autumn 2009. With the new model of the instrumental polarization
of NACO it is possible to measure the polarization with an accuracy of 1% in
polarization degree. The uncertainty of the polarization angle is < 5{\deg} for
polarization degrees > 4%. For highly sampled polarimetric time series we find
that the improved understanding of the polarization properties gives results
that are fully consistent with the previously used method to derive the
polarization. The small difference between the derived and the previously

noise, and the boundary conditions of the intrusions (which simulate the

contains the thermal Casimir effect as a particular limit and generalizes the
study of the Casimir effect to such systems through their dynamical equations,
with no appeal to their Hamiltonian, if any exists. In particular, we study the
Casimir force between two infinite parallel plates with Dirichlet or Neumann
boundary conditions, immersed in several media with finite correlation lengths

a semi-infinite chain with nearest-neighbor interactions. The transformation is
uniquely determined by $J_{0}$ and defines a sequence

that its limit is the quasi-Ohmic expression provided by the Rubin model of

$J_{0}$, convergence is fast enough to be useful in practice for an effective

should provide the central explanatory principle in biology, in the sense that
any behavioral strategy that is optimal for an organism's survival must
necessarily involve efficient information processing. We challenge this view by
providing a counterexample. We present an analytically tractable model for a
particular instance of a perception-action loop: a creature searching for a
food source confined to a one-dimensional ring world. The model incorporates
the statistical structure of the creature's world, the effects of the
creature's actions on that structure, and the creature's strategic decision
process. The model takes the form of a Markov process on an infinite
dimensional state space. To analyze it we construct an exact coarse graining
that reduces the model to a Markov process on a finite number of ""information
states"". This technique allows us to make quantitative comparisons between the
performance of an information-theoretically optimal strategy with other
candidate strategies on a food gathering task. We find that: 1. Information
optimal search does not necessarily optimize utility (expected food gain). 2.
The rank ordering of search strategies by information performance does not
predict their ordering by expected food obtained. 3. The relative advantage of
different strategies depends on the statistical structure of the environment,
in particular the variability of motion of the source. We conclude that there
is no simple relationship between information and utility. Behavioral
optimality does not imply information efficiency, nor is there a simple
tradeoff between gaining information about a food source versus obtaining the
food itself.

Arrhenius law with an activation barrier equal to the domain wall energy in the

by nucleation of a reversed magnetization domain primarily at the chain edge
followed by a subsequent propagation of the domain wall to the other edge in a
random-walk fashion. This results in a linear dependence of the lifetime on the
chain length, if the magnetization correlation length is not exceeded. We
studied chains of uniaxial and tri-axial anisotropy and found that a tri-axial
anisotropy leads to a reduction of the magnetization lifetime due to a higher
reversal attempt rate, even though the activation barrier is not changed.

developed a two-step CVD process to synthesize graphene films with domains

Raman spectroscopy clearly show an increase in domain size by changing the

simulations on a number of small proteins which are commonly used for testing
protein folding procedures: protein G, the SH3 domain of Src tyrosine kinase

initially most massive component transferred part of its envelope to the

considered: the MSSM, two Higgs doublet model, the recent dodeca model, and a
new $Z'$ model. Generally, it is hard to achieve such a large CP violation
consistently with other experimental constraints. We find that a scheme with
extra non-anomalous U(1)$'$ gauge symmetry is barely consistent. In general,
the extra $Z'$ gauge boson induces the flavor changing neutral current
interactions at tree level, which is the basic reason allowing a large new
physics CP violation. To preserve the U(1)$'$ symmetry at high energy,
SU(2)$_L$ singlet exotic heavy quarks of mass above 1 TeV and the Standard
Model gauge singlet scalars are introduced.

(namely, Bankruptcy status) if a perfectly competitive market reaches full
employment (namely, those people who should obtain employment have obtained
employment). As a result, appearance of economic crisis is determined by two
points; that is, (a). Stock market approaches perfect competition; (b). Society
reaches full employment. The empirical research of these two points would lead
to early warning of economic crisis. Moreover, it is a surprise that the state
of economic crisis would be a feasible equilibrium within the framework of the
Arrow-Debreu model. That means that we can not understand the origin of
economic crisis within the framework of modern economics, for example, the
general equilibrium theory.
