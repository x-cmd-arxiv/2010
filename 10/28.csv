in the 2 - 8 M\odot range on cosmic chemical evolution. We discuss the
implications of this population as it pertains to several cosmological and
astrophysical observables. For example, some very metal-poor galactic stars
show large enhancements of carbon, typical of the C-rich ejecta of low-mass
stars but not of supernovae; moreover, halo star carbon and oxygen abundances
show wide scatter, which imply a wide range of star-formation and
nucleosynthetic histories contributed to the first generations of stars. Also,
recent analyses of the 4He abundance in metal-poor extragalactic H II regions
suggest an elevated abundance Yp \simeq 0.256 by mass, higher than the
predicted result from big bang nucleosynthesis assuming the baryon density
determined by WMAP, Yp = 0.249. Although there are large uncertainties in the
observational determination of 4He, this offset may suggest a prompt initial
enrichment of 4He in early metal-poor structures. We also discuss the effect of
intermediate mass stars on global cosmic evolution, the reionization of the
Universe, the density of white dwarfs, as well as SNII and SNIa rates at high
redshift. We also comment on the early astration of D and 7Li. We conclude that
if intermediate mass stars are to be associated with Population III stars,
their relevance is limited (primarily from observed abundance patterns) to low
mass structures involving a limited fraction of the total baryon content of the
Universe.

reveal an intricate coupling between EDL overlap phenomenon and finite ionic

applications. A recent approach that has drawn considerable attention is sparse
representation modeling, in which the signal is assumed to be generated as a
combination of a few atoms from a given dictionary. In this work we consider a
Bayesian setting and go beyond the classic assumption of independence between
the atoms. The main goal of this paper is to introduce a statistical model that
takes such dependencies into account and show how this model can be used for
sparse signal recovery. We follow the suggestion of two recent works and assume
that the sparsity pattern is modeled by a Boltzmann machine, a commonly used
graphical model. For general dependency models, exact MAP and MMSE estimation
of the sparse representation becomes computationally complex. To simplify the
computations, we propose greedy approximations of the MAP and MMSE estimators.
We then consider a special case in which exact MAP is feasible, by assuming
that the dictionary is unitary and the dependency model corresponds to a
certain sparse graph. Exploiting this structure, we develop an efficient
message passing algorithm that recovers the underlying signal. When the model
parameters defining the underlying graph are unknown, we suggest an algorithm
that learns these parameters directly from the data, leading to an iterative
scheme for adaptive sparse signal recovery. The effectiveness of our approach
is demonstrated on real-life signals - patches of natural images - where we
compare the denoising performance to that of previous recovery methods that do
not exploit the statistical dependencies.

solution which corresponds to a point-like mass source. In this case the
soliton parameter k=2, which is clearly contrary to this restriction. Similar
problem with the observations takes place for static spherically symmetric
perfect fluid with the dust-like equation of state in all dimensions. The
common for both of these models is the same equations of state in our three
dimensions and in the extra dimensions. All dimensions are treated at equal
footing. To be in agreement with observations, it is necessary to break the
symmetry between the external/our and internal spaces. It takes place for black
strings which are particular examples of solitons with k\to \infty. For such k,
black strings are in concordance with the observations. Moreover, we show that
they are the only solitons which are at the same level of agreement with the
observations as in general relativity. Black strings can be treated as perfect
fluid with dust-like equation of state p_0=0 in the external/our space and very
specific equation of state p_1=-(1/2)\epsilon in the internal space. The latter
equation is due to negative tension in the extra dimension. We also demonstrate
that dimension 3 for the external space is a special one. Only in this case we
get the latter equation of state. We show that the black string equations of
state satisfy the necessary condition of the internal space stabilization.
Therefore, black strings are good candidates for a viable model of
astrophysical objects (e.g., Sun) if we can provide a satisfactory explanation
of negative tension for particles constituting these objects.

Features in the velocity distribution observed at one galactic radius are also

to coupling of the bound state to radiation modes. The decay-rate of this
metastable state is governed by {\it Fermi's Golden Rule}, $\Gamma[V]$, which
depends on the potential $V$ and the details of the forcing. We pose the
potential design problem: find $V_{opt}$ which minimizes $\Gamma[V]$ (maximizes
the lifetime of the state) over an admissible class of potentials with fixed
spatial support. We formulate this problem as a constrained optimization
problem and prove that an admissible optimal solution exists. Then, using
quasi-Newton methods, we compute locally optimal potentials. These have the
structure of a truncated periodic potential with a localized defect. In
contrast to optimal structures for other spectral optimization problems, our
optimizing potentials appear to be interior points of the constraint set and to
be smooth. The multi-scale structures that emerge incorporate the physical
mechanisms of energy confinement via material contrast and interference
effects.
  An analysis of locally optimal potentials reveals local optimality is
attained via two mechanisms: (i) decreasing the density of states near a
resonant frequency in the continuum and (ii) tuning the oscillations of
extended states to make $\Gamma[V]$, an oscillatory integral, small. Our
approach achieves lifetimes, $\sim (\epsilon^2\Gamma[V])^{-1}$, for locally
optimal potentials with $\Gamma^{-1}\sim\mathcal{O}(10^{9})$ as compared with
$\Gamma^{-1}\sim \mathcal{O}(10^{2})$ for a typical potential. Finally, we
explore the performance of optimal potentials via simulations of the
time-evolution.

We give a straightforward procedure to scan the space of complex R-matrices in

insensitive to theta_13. Moreover, the values of the branching ratio are
typically larger than those quoted in the literature, due to the large number
of acceptable points in the parameter-space which were not considered before.

surp(F) + 1 + log_2(surp(F)) for lean clause-sets F in dependency on the
surplus surp(F).
  - Lean clause-sets, defined as having no non-trivial autarkies, generalise
minimally unsatisfiable clause-sets.
  - For the surplus we have surp(F) <= delta(F) = c(F) - n(F), using the
deficiency delta(F) of clause-sets, the difference between the number of
clauses and the number of variables.
  - nM(k) is the k-th ""non-Mersenne"" number, skipping in the sequence of
natural numbers all numbers of the form 2^n - 1.
  We conjecture that this bound is nearly precise for minimally unsatisfiable
clause-sets.
  As an application of the upper bound we obtain that (arbitrary!) clause-sets
F with mvd(F) > nM(surp(F)) must have a non-trivial autarky (so clauses can be
removed satisfiability-equivalently by an assignment satisfying some clauses
and not touching the other clauses). It is open whether such an autarky can be
found in polynomial time.
  As a future application we discuss the classification of minimally
unsatisfiable clause-sets depending on the deficiency.

seed the cosmic structures we observe today. These perturbations are usually
computed as the result of the gravitationally-induced spontaneous creation of
perturbations from an initial vacuum state. In this paper, we compute the
perturbations arising from gravitationally-induced stimulated creation when
perturbations are already present in the initial state. The effect of these
initial perturbations is not diluted by inflation and survives to its end, and
beyond. We consider a generic statistical density operator $\rho$ describing an
initial mixed state that includes probabilities for nonzero numbers of scalar
perturbations to be present at early times during inflation. We analyze the
primordial bispectrum for general configurations of the three different
momentum vectors in its arguments. We find that the initial presence of quanta
can significantly enhance non-gaussianities in the so-called squeezed limit.
Our results show that an observation of non-gaussianities in the squeezed limit
can occur for single-field inflation when the state in the very early

perturbations. Valuable information about the initial state can then be

debatable. While punishment is traditionally considered more successful than
reward, the fact that the cost of punishment frequently fails to offset gains
from enhanced cooperation has lead some to reconsider reward as the main
catalyst behind collaborative efforts. Here we elaborate on the ""stick versus
carrot"" dilemma by studying the evolution of cooperation in the spatial public
goods game, where besides the traditional cooperators and defectors, rewarding
cooperators supplement the array of possible strategies. The latter are willing
to reward cooperative actions at a personal cost, thus effectively downgrading
pure cooperators to second-order free-riders due to their unwillingness to bear
these additional costs. Consequently, we find that defection remains viable,
especially if the rewarding is costly. Rewards, however, can promote
cooperation, especially if the synergetic effects of cooperation are low.
Surprisingly, moderate rewards may promote cooperation better than high
rewards, which is due to the spontaneous emergence of cyclic dominance between
the three strategies.

pairs spanning a range of projected separations (r_p < 80 h_{70}^{-1} kpc),
relative velocities (\Delta v < 10,000 km/s, which includes projected pairs
that are essential for quality control), and stellar mass ratios (from 1:10 to
10:1). We find that the red fraction of galaxies in pairs is higher than that
of a control sample matched in stellar mass and redshift, and demonstrate that
this difference is likely due to the fact that galaxy pairs reside in higher
density environments than non-paired galaxies. We detect clear signs of
interaction-induced star formation within the blue galaxies in pairs, as
evidenced by a higher fraction of extremely blue galaxies, along with blueward
offsets between the colours of paired versus control galaxies. These signs are
strongest in close pairs (r_p < 30 h_{70}^{-1} kpc and \Delta v < 200 km/s),
diminish for more widely separated pairs (r_p > 60 h_{70}^{-1} kpc and \Delta v
< 200 km/s) and disappear for close projected pairs (r_p < 30 h_{70}^{-1} kpc
and \Delta v > 3000 km/s). These effects are also stronger in central (fibre)
colours than in global colours, and are found primarily in low- to
medium-density environments. Conversely, no such trends are seen in red
galaxies, apart from a small reddening at small separations which may result
from residual errors with photometry in crowded fields. When interpreted in
conjunction with a simple model of induced starbursts, these results are
consistent with a scenario in which close peri-centre passages trigger induced
star formation in the centres of galaxies which are sufficiently gas rich,
after which time the galaxies gradually redden as they separate and their
starbursts age.

the inspiral of compact objects on to a massive black hole (MBH), commonly
referred to as an ""extreme-mass ratio inspiral"" (EMRI). The small object,
typically a stellar black hole (bh), emits significant amounts of GW along each
orbit in the detector bandwidth. The slowly, adiabatic inspiral of these
sources will allow us to map space-time around MBHs in detail, as well as to
test our current conception of gravitation in the strong regime. The event rate
of this kind of source has been addressed many times in the literature and the
numbers reported fluctuate by orders of magnitude. On the other hand, recent
observations of the Galactic center revealed a dearth of giant stars inside the
inner parsec relative to the numbers theoretically expected for a fully relaxed
stellar cusp. The possibility of unrelaxed nuclei (or, equivalently, with no or
only a very shallow cusp) adds substantial uncertainty to the estimates. Having
this timely question in mind, we run a significant number of direct-summation
$N-$body simulations with up to half a million particles to calibrate a much
faster orbit-averaged Fokker-Planck code. We then investigate the regime of
strong mass segregation (SMS) for models with two different stellar mass
components. We show that, under quite generic initial conditions, the time
required for the growth of a relaxed, mass segregated stellar cusp is shorter
than a Hubble time for MBHs with $M_\bullet \lesssim 5 \times 10^6 M_\odot$

EMRI rates by a factor of $\sim 10$ for our fiducial models of Milky Way type
galactic nuclei.

of their own dark matter halos was first proposed by Peebles (1984), and has
recently been revived to explain the puzzling abundance patterns observed
within many GCs. In this paper we demonstrate that the outer stellar density
profile of isolated GCs is very sensitive to the presence of an extended dark
halo. The GCs NGC 2419, located at 90 kpc from the center of our Galaxy, and
MGC1, located at ~200 kpc from the center of M31, are ideal laboratories for
testing the scenario that GCs formed at the centers of massive dark halos.
Comparing analytic models to observations of these GCs, we conclude that these
GCs cannot be embedded within dark halos with a virial mass greater than 10^6
Msun, or, equivalently, the dark matter halo mass-to-stellar mass ratio must be
Mdm/M_*<1. If these GCs have indeed orbited within weak tidal fields throughout
their lifetimes, then these limits imply that these GCs did not form within
their own dark halos. Recent observations of an extended stellar halo in the GC
NGC 1851 are also interpreted in the context of our analytic models.
Implications of these results for the formation of GCs are briefly discussed.

factor of approximately 5 +/- 2 increase over measurements of the cluster rate

power law (proportional to t^s). Under the assumption of a cluster formation
redshift of z_f = 3, our rate measurement in combination with lower-redshift
cluster SN Ia rates constrains s = -1.41 +0.47/-0.40, consistent with
measurements of the delay time distribution in the field. This measurement is
generally consistent with expectations for the ""double degenerate"" scenario and
inconsistent with some models for the ""single degenerate"" scenario predicting a
steeper delay time distribution at large delay times. We check for
environmental dependence and the influence of younger stellar populations by
calculating the rate specifically in cluster red-sequence galaxies and in
morphologically early-type galaxies, finding results similar to the full
cluster rate. Finally, the upper limit of one host-less cluster SN Ia detected
in the survey implies that the fraction of stars in the intra-cluster medium is

6876 sources, selected at 250 microns, within ~14 sq. degrees. SPIRE sources
are extracted using a new method specifically developed for Herschel data; PACS
counterparts of these sources are identified using circular apertures placed at
the SPIRE positions. Aperture flux densities are measured for sources
identified as extended after matching to optical wavelengths. The reliability
of this catalogue is also discussed, using full simulated maps at the three
SPIRE bands. These show that a significant number of sources at 350 and 500
microns have undergone flux density enhancements of up to a factor of ~2, due
mainly to source confusion. Correction factors are determined for these

our universe, and thus provide a unique laboratory for exploring the properties
of cold matter at super-nuclear density. Measurements of the masses or radii of
these objects can strongly constrain the neutron-star matter equation of state,
and consequently the interior composition of neutron stars. Neutron stars that
are visible as millisecond radio pulsars are especially useful in this respect,
as timing observations of the radio pulses provide an extremely precise probe
of both the pulsar's motion and the surrounding space-time metric. In
particular, for a pulsar in a binary system, detection of the general
relativistic Shapiro delay allows us to infer the masses of both the neutron
star and its binary companion to high precision. Here we present radio timing
observations of the binary millisecond pulsar PSR J1614-2230, which show a
strong Shapiro delay signature. The implied pulsar mass of 1.97 +/- 0.04 M_sun
is by far the highest yet measured with such certainty, and effectively rules
out the presence of hyperons, bosons, or free quarks at densities comparable to
the nuclear saturation density.

accompanying measurement of the stellar radius, it has a strong impact on our
understanding of nuclear matter, gamma-ray bursts, and the generation of
gravitational waves from coalescing neutron stars. This single high mass value
indicates that a transition to quark matter in neutron-star cores can occur at
densities comparable to the nuclear saturation density only if the quarks are
strongly interacting and are color superconducting. We further show that a high
maximum neutron-star mass is required if short duration gamma-ray bursts are
powered by coalescing neutron stars and, therefore, this mechanism becomes
viable in the light of the recent measurement. Finally, we argue that the
low-frequency (<= 500 Hz) gravitational waves emitted during the final stages
of neutron-star coalescence encode the properties of the equation of state

parameter regimes but remains unknown in general. In this paper we provide a
comparative overview of this channel model as we proceed through our
contributions: we present a new outer bound based on the idea of a broadcast
channel with degraded message sets, and another series of outer bounds obtained
by transforming the cognitive channel into channels with known capacity. We
specialize the largest known inner bound derived for the discrete memoryless
channel to the Gaussian noise channel and present several simplified schemes
evaluated for Gaussian inputs in closed form which we use to prove a number of
results. These include a new set of capacity results for the a) ""primary
decodes cognitive"" regime, a subset of the ""strong interference"" regime that is
not included in the ""very strong interference"" regime for which capacity was
known, and for the b) ""S-channel"" in which the primary transmitter does not
interfere with the cognitive receiver. Next, for a general Gaussian cognitive
interference channel, we determine the capacity to within one bit/s/Hz and to
within a factor two regardless of channel parameters, thus establishing rate
performance guarantees at high and low SNR, respectively. We also show how
different simplified transmission schemes achieve a constant gap between inner
and outer bound for specific channels. Finally, we numerically evaluate and
compare the various simplified achievable rate regions and outer bounds in
parameter regimes where capacity is unknown, leading to further insight on the
capacity region of the Gaussian cognitive interference channel.

the polymer elongation cannot exceed a limit $\sqrt{b}$, yielding all
interesting features near the boundary. In this paper we establish the local
well-posedness for the FENE dumbbell model under a class of Dirichlet-type
boundary conditions dictated by the parameter $b$. As a result, for each $b>0$
we identify a sharp boundary requirement for the underlying density
distribution, while the sharpness follows from the existence result for each
specification of the boundary behavior. It is shown that the probability
density governed by the Fokker-Planck equation approaches zero near boundary,
necessarily faster than the distance function $d$ for $b>2$, faster than $d|ln
d|$ for $b=2$, and as fast as $d^{b/2}$ for $0<b<2$. Moreover, the sharp
boundary requirement for $b\geq 2$ is also sufficient for the distribution to
remain a probability density.

is possible that the gamma-ray loud FSRQs are fundamentally different from the

massive enough to become gravitationally unstable and able to cool fast enough
for self-gravitating clumps to form and survive. Models with simplified disk
cooling have shown the critical importance of the ratio of the cooling to the
orbital timescales. Uncertainties about the proper value of this ratio can be
sidestepped by including radiative transfer. Three-dimensional radiative
hydrodynamics models of a disk with a mass of $0.043 M_\odot$ from 4 to 20 AU
in orbit around a $1 M_\odot$ protostar show that disk instabilities are
considerably less successful in producing self-gravitating clumps than in a
disk with twice this mass. The results are sensitive to the assumed initial
outer disk ($T_o$) temperatures. Models with $T_o$ = 20 K are able to form a
single self-gravitating clump, whereas models with $T_o$ = 25 K form clumps
that are not quite self-gravitating. These models imply that disk instability
requires a disk with a mass of at least $\sim 0.043 M_\odot$ inside 20 AU in
order to form giant planets around solar-mass protostars with realistic disk
cooling rates and outer disk temperatures. Lower mass disks around solar-mass
protostars must rely upon core accretion to form inner giant planets.

pedagogical introduction to the gauge approach to gravity. I begin with a
review of the Einstein-Cartan formulation of gravity, move on to the
Macdowell-Mansouri approach, then show how gravity can be viewed as the
symmetry broken phase of an (A)dS-gauge theory. This covers roughly the first
half of the article. Armed with these tools, the remainder of the article is
geared toward new insights and new lines of research that can be gained by
viewing gravity from this perspective. Drawing from familiar concepts from the
symmetry broken gauge theories of the standard model, we show how the
topological structure of the gauge group allows for an infinite class of new
solutions to the Einstein-Cartan field equations that can be thought of as
degenerate ground states of the theory. We argue that quantum mechanical
tunneling allows for transitions between the degenerate vacua. Generalizing the
tunneling process from a topological phase of the gauge theory to an arbitrary
geometry leads to a modern reformulation of the Hartle-Hawking ""no boundary""
proposal.

droplets and microbubbles dispersed in bodies of water reflect sunlight in much
the same way. The lifetime of sunlight-reflecting microbubbles, and hence the
scale on which they may be applied, depends on Stokes Law and the influence of
ambient or added surfactants. Small bubbles backscatter light more efficiently
than large ones, opening the possibility of using highly dilute micron-radius
hydrosols to substantially brighten surface waters. Such microbubbles can
noticeably increase water surface reflectivity, even at volume fractions of
parts per million and such loadings can be created at an energy cost as low as
J m-2 to initiate and milliwatts m-2 to sustain. Increasing water albedo in
this way can reduce solar energy absorption by as much as 100 W m-2,
potentially reducing equilibrium temperatures of standing water bodies by
several Kelvins. While aerosols injected into the stratosphere tend to alter
climate globally, hydrosols can be used to modulate surface albedo, locally and
reversibly, without risk of degrading the ozone layer or altering the color of

the confluence of exciting advances in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and an
explosion of related experimental activity. The early years of this period were
chronicled in the Quarkonium Working Group (QWG) CERN Yellow Report (YR) in
2004, which presented a comprehensive review of the status of the field at that
time and provided specific recommendations for further progress. However, the
broad spectrum of subsequent breakthroughs, surprises, and continuing puzzles
could only be partially anticipated. Since the release of the YR, the BESII
program concluded only to give birth to BESIII; the $B$-factories and CLEO-c
flourished; quarkonium production and polarization measurements at HERA and the
Tevatron matured; and heavy-ion collisions at RHIC have opened a window on the
deconfinement regime. All these experiments leave legacies of quality,
precision, and unsolved mysteries for quarkonium physics, and therefore beg for
continuing investigations. The plethora of newly-found quarkonium-like states
unleashed a flood of theoretical investigations into new forms of matter such
as quark-gluon hybrids, mesonic molecules, and tetraquarks. Measurements of the
spectroscopy, decays, production, and in-medium behavior of c\bar{c}, b\bar{b},
and b\bar{c} bound states have been shown to validate some theoretical
approaches to QCD and highlight lack of quantitative success for others. The
intriguing details of quarkonium suppression in heavy-ion collisions that have
emerged from RHIC have elevated the importance of separating hot- and
cold-nuclear-matter effects in quark-gluon plasma studies. This review
systematically addresses all these matters and concludes by prioritizing
directions for ongoing and future efforts.

measure spins of single electrons is crucial for these applications. Here we
report the manipulation and measurement of a single spin in a quantum dot
fabricated in a silicon/silicon-germanium heterostructure. We demonstrate that
the rate of loading of electrons into the device can be tuned over an order of
magnitude using a gate voltage, that the spin state of the loaded electron
depends systematically on the loading voltage level, and that this tunability
arises because electron spins can be loaded through excited orbital states of
the quantum dot. The longitudinal spin relaxation time T1 is measured using
single-shot pulsed techniques and found to be ~3 seconds at a field of 1.85
Tesla. The demonstration of single spin measurement as well as a long spin
relaxation time and tunability of the loading are all favorable properties for
spintronics and quantum information processing applications.

law for a network of $n$ interdependent networks. In particular, we find that
for $n$ Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi networks each of average degree $k$, the giant

coincides for $n=1$ with the known Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi second-order phase
transition for a single network. For any $n \geq 2$ cascading failures occur
and the transition becomes a first-order percolation transition. The new law
for $P_{\infty}$ shows that percolation theory that is extensively studied in
physics and mathematics is a limiting case ($n=1$) of a more general general

of 2.18 \mu_B per Co ion, are aligned along the crystallographic c-axis. Within
the screw chains, along the c axis, the moments are arranged
antiferromagnetically. In the basal planes the spins are arranged
ferromagnetically (forming zig-zags paths) along one of the axis and
antiferromagnetically along the other. The temperature dependence of the
sub-lattice magnetization is consistent with the expectations of the 3D Ising

different muon stopping sites. Muon time spectra measured at weak longitudinal
fields and temperatures much higher than T_N can be well described using a
single muon site with an exponential muon spin relaxation that gradually
changes into an stretched exponential on approaching T_N. The
temperature-induced changes of the relaxation suggest that the Co fluctuations
dramatically slow down and the system becomes less homogeneous as it approaches
the antiferromagnetic state.

from thermodynamics considerations [1, 2] is stirred up by a recent proposal
that 'gravity is an entropic force' [3] (see also [4]). Even though I find the
arguments justifying such a claim in this latest proposal rather ad hoc and
simplistic compared to the original one I would unreservedly support the call
to explore deeper the relation between gravity and thermodynamics, this having
the same spirit as my long-held view that general relativity is the
hydrodynamic limit [5, 6] of some underlying theories for the microscopic
structure of spacetime - all these proposals, together with that of [7, 8],
attest to the emergent nature of gravity [9]. In this first paper of two we set
the modest goal of studying the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of classical
matter only, bringing afore some interesting prior results, without invoking
any quantum considerations such as Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, holography or
Unruh effect. This is for the sake of understanding the nonequilibrium nature
of classical gravity which is at the root of many salient features of black
hole physics. One important property of gravitational systems, from
self-gravitating gas to black holes, is their negative heat capacity, which is
the source of many out-of-the ordinary dynamical and thermodynamic features
such as the non-existence in isolated systems of thermodynamically stable
configurations, which actually provides the condition for gravitational
stability. A related property is that, being systems with long range
interaction, they are nonextensive and relax extremely slowly towards
equilibrium. Here we explore how much of the known features of black hole
thermodynamics can be derived from this classical nonequilibrium perspective. A
sequel paper will address gravity and nonequilibrium thermodynamics of quantum
fields [10].

Moore bound by $\epsilon$ are called {\it graphs with defect or excess
$\epsilon$}, respectively.
  While {\it Moore graphs} (graphs with $\epsilon=0$) and graphs with defect or
excess 1 have been characterized almost completely, graphs with defect or
excess 2 represent a wide unexplored area.
  Graphs with defect (excess) 2 satisfy the equation $G_{d,k}(A) = J_n + B$
($G_{d,k}(A) = J_n-B$), where $A$ denotes the adjacency matrix of the graph in
question, $n$ its order, $J_n$ the $n\times n$ matrix whose entries are all
1's, $B$ the adjacency matrix of a union of vertex-disjoint cycles, and
$G_{d,k}(x)$ a polynomial with integer coefficients such that the matrix
$G_{d,k}(A)$ gives the number of paths of length at most $k$ joining each pair
of vertices in the graph.
  In particular, if $B$ is the adjacency matrix of a cycle of order $n$ we call
the corresponding graphs \emph{graphs with cyclic defect or excess}; these
graphs are the subject of our attention in this paper.
  We prove the non-existence of infinitely many such graphs. As the highlight
of the paper we provide the asymptotic upper bound of $O(\frac{64}3d^{3/2})$
for the number of graphs of odd degree $d\ge3$ and cyclic defect or excess.
This bound is in fact quite generous, and as a way of illustration, we show the
non-existence of some families of graphs of odd degree $d\ge3$ and cyclic
defect or excess.
  Actually, we conjecture that, apart from the M\""obius ladder on 8 vertices,
no non-trivial graph of any degree $\ge 3$ and cyclic defect or excess exists.

the Schwarzschild black hole, contain a region hidden behind the event horizon
where all their Killing vectors are spacelike. This region is nonstationary and
the time $t$ labels a continuous set of classical microstates, the phase space
$[\,h_{ab}(t), P^{ab}(t)\,]$, where $h_{ab}$ is a three-metric induced on a
spacelike hypersurface $\Sigma_t$ and $P^{ab}$ is its momentum conjugate. We
determine explicitly the phase space in the interior region of the
Schwarzschild black hole. We identify its entropy as a measure of an outside
observer's ignorance of the classical microstates in the interior since the
parameter $t$ which labels the states lies anywhere between 0 and 2M. We
provide numerical evidence from recent simulations of gravitational collapse in
isotropic coordinates that the entropy of the Schwarzschild black hole stems
from the region inside and near the event horizon where the metric fields are
nonstationary; the rest of the spacetime, which is static, makes no
contribution. Extremal black holes have an event horizon but in contrast to
non-extremal black holes, their extended spacetimes do not possess a bifurcate
Killing horizon. This is consistent with the fact that extremal black holes are

age of an asteroid's surface \citep{bib.bot05a,bib.nes05} is the time since its
last catastrophic disruption event which is a function of the object's
diameter. The age of an S-complex asteroid's surface may also be determined
from its color using a space weathering model
\citep[e.g.][]{bib.wil10,bib.jed04,bib.wil08,bib.mar06}. We used a sample of 95
S-complex asteroids from SMASS and obtained their absolute magnitudes and
$u,g,r,i,z$ filter magnitudes from SDSS. The absolute magnitudes yield a
size-derived age distribution. The $u,g,r,i,z$ filter magnitudes lead to the
principal component color which yields a color-derived age distribution by
inverting our color-age relationship, an enhanced version of the `dual $\tau$'
space weathering model of \citet{bib.wil10}.
  We fit the size-age distribution to the enhanced dual $\tau$ model and found
characteristic weathering and gardening times of $\tau_w = 2050 \pm 80$ Myr and
$\tau_g = 4400^{+700}_{-500}$ Myr respectively. The fit also suggests an
initial principal component color of $-0.05 \pm 0.01$ for fresh asteroid

in the Standard Model at the LHC, in which the Higgs mechanism or other new
physics processes must intervene to preserve the unitarity of the process below
1 TeV. This channel is expected to be one of the most sensitive to determine
whether the Higgs boson exists. In this paper, the final state with two same
sign Ws is studied, with a simulated sample corresponding to the integrated
luminosity of 60 fb$^{-1}$ in pp collision at $\sqrt{s}=$10 TeV. Two
observables, the invariant mass of $\mu\mu$ from W decays and the azimuthal
angle difference between the two $\mu$s, are utilized to distinguish the Higgs
boson existence scenario from the Higgs boson absence scenario. A good signal
significance for the two cases can be achieved. If we define the separation
power of the analysis as the distance, in the log-likelihood plane, of
pseudo-experiments outcomes in the two cases, with the total statistics
expected from the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the nominal centre-of-mass
energy of 14 TeV, the separation power will be at the level of 4 $\sigma$.

ejection (CME) and the radiative energy loss in associated flare plasma, with
the decrease in magnetic free energy during a release in active region NOAA
10930 on December 13, 2006 during the declining phase of the solar cycle 23.
The ejected CME was fast and directed towards the Earth with a projected speed
of 1780 km/s and a de-projected speed of 3060 km/s. We regard these as lower
and upper limits for our calculations. It was accompanied by an X3.4 class
flare in the active region. The CME carried (1.2-4.5)x10^32 erg
(projected-deprojected) of kinetic and gravitational potential energy. The
estimated radiative energy loss during the flare was found to be 9.0x10^30 erg.
The sum of these energies was compared with the decrease in measured free
magnetic energy during the flare/CME. The free energy is that above the minimum
energy configuration and was estimated using the magnetic virial theorem. The
estimated decrease in magnetic free energy is large, 3.11x10^32 erg after the
flare/CME compared to the pre-flare energy. Given the range of possible
energies we estimate that 50-100% of the CME energy arose from the active
region. The rest of the free magnetic energy was distributed among the
radiative energy loss, particle acceleration, plasma and magnetic field
reorientation.

is to pump just long enough such that the emitter $+$ cavity system is in a

computer for measuring, processing and analyzing data and to prepare it for

This paper presents a new approach for data acquisition by using keyboard
emulation technique. A keyboard emulation software is developed which runs
beside the main data acquisition software and acts as a virtual user. All the
operations which require user interface are performed through fully automated
computer program. The developed software/system is executed in a real time

a modest effect on the boundaries and the critical temperature for the

X-ray source (SSS) phase. Recently, Gilfanov & Bogdan (2010, hereafter GB10)
claimed that observed X-ray fluxes of early type galaxies would be too low to
be consistent with the prediction of the SD scenario based on rather simple
assumptions. We present realistic evolutionary models of SD systems and
calculate durations of SSS phases. In most cases, accreting WDs spend a large
fraction of time in the optically thick wind phase and the recurrent nova phase
rather than the SSS phase. Thus the SSS phase lasts only for a few hundred
thousand years. This is by a factor of ~10 shorter than those adopted by GB10
where the SN~Ia progenitor WD was assumed to spend most of its life as a SSS.
The theoretical X-ray luminosity of the SSS has a large uncertainty because of
the uncertain atmospheric model of mass-accreting WDs and absorption of soft
X-rays by the companion star's cool wind material. We thus adopt an average of
the observed fluxes of existing symbiotic SSSs, i.e., ~0.4 x 10^{36} erg s^{-1}
for 0.3--0.7 keV. Using these SSS duration and soft X-ray luminosity, we show
that the observed X-ray flux obtained by GB10 is rather consistent with our
estimated flux in early type galaxies based on the SD scenario. This is a
strong support for the SD scenario as a main-contributor of SNe Ia in early
type galaxies.

disorder-induced spin-orbit coupling is evident in the latter sample,

canonical pulsars. We use a Monte-Carlo technique to simulate the Galactic
population of neutron stars and the radio pulsars. For each simulated neutron
star, we consider the $\gamma$-ray emission from the outer gap accelerator in
the magnetosphere. In our outer gap model, we apply the gap closure mechanism
proposed by Takata et al., in which both photon-photon pair-creation and
magnetic pair-creation processes are considered. Simulating the sensitivities
of previous major radio surveys, our simulation predicts that there are $\sim
18-23$ radio loud and $\sim 26-34$ $\gamma$-ray-selected $\gamma$-ray pulsars,
which can be detected with a $\gamma$-ray flux $F_{\gamma}\ge
10^{-10}~\mathrm{erg/cm^2 s}$. Applying the sensitivity of the six-month
observation of the $Fermi$ telescope, 40-61 radio-selected and 36-75
$\gamma$-ray selected pulsars are detected within our simulation. We show that
the distributions of various pulsar parameters for the simulated $\gamma$-ray
pulsars can be consistent with the observed distribution of the $\gamma$-ray
pulsars detected by the $Fermi$ telescope. We also predict that $\sim 64$
radio-loud and $\sim 340$ $\gamma$-ray-selected pulsars irradiate the Earth
with a flux $F_{\gamma}\ge 10^{-11}~\mathrm{erg/cm^2 s}$, and most of those
$\gamma$-ray pulsars are distributing with a distance more than 1~kpc and a
flux $F_{\gamma}\sim 10^{-11}~\mathrm{erg/cm^2 s}$. The ration between the
radio-selected and $\gamma$-ray-selected pulsars depend on the sensitivity of
the radio surveys. We also discuss the Galactic distribution of the
unidentified $Fermi$ sources and the canonical $\gamma$-ray pulsars.

electron transport phenomena through a periodically driven single quantum dot
in an electrode-multi-level dot-electrode nanoscale quantum device. The memory
effect is treated using a multi-function Lorentzian spectral density (LSD)
model that mimics the spectral density of each electrode in terms of multiple
Lorentzian functions. For the symmetric single-function LSD model involving a
single-level dot, the underlying single-particle propagator is shown to be
related to a 2 x 2 effective time-dependent Hamiltonian that includes both the
periodic external field and the electrode memory effect. By invoking the
generalized Van Vleck (GVV) nearly degenerate perturbation theory, an
analytical Tien-Gordon-like expression is derived for arbitrary order multi-
photon resonance d.c. tunneling current. Numerically converged simulations and
the GVV analytical results are in good agreement, revealing the origin of
multi- photon coherent destruction of tunneling and accounting for the
suppression of the staircase jumps of d.c. current due to the memory effect.
Specially, a novel blockade phenomenon is observed, showing distinctive
oscillations in the field-induced current in the large bias voltage limit.

but the introduction of an additional parameter, the degeneracy of the
hypergraph $H=(V,{\cal F})$, makes the problem not only fixed-parameter
tractable, but also one with a linear kernel. Here the degeneracy of
$H=(V,{\cal F})$ is the minimum integer $d$ such that for each $X\subset V$ the
hypergraph with vertex set $V\setminus X$ and edge set containing all edges of

viewed as a special case of {\sc Directed Nonblocker} (replace an undirected

excitons is locked at small input currents due to a complete leakage caused by
the interlayer tunneling. We show that the counterflow critical current
I_c^{CF} above which the system unlocks for the counterflow transport can be
controlled by a tilt of magnetic field in the plane perpendicular to the
current direction. The effect is asymmetric with respect to the tilting angle.
The unlocking is accompanied by switching of the systems from the d.c. to the
a.c. Josephson state. Similar switching takes place for the tunneling set-up
when the current flowing through the system exceeds the critical value I_c^T.
At zero tilt the relation between the tunnel and counterflow critical currents
is I_c^T=2 I_c^{CF}. We compare the influence of the in-plane magnetic field
component B_\parallel on the critical currents I_c^{CF} and I_c^T. The in-plane
magnetic field reduces the tunnel critical current and this reduction is
symmetric with respect to the tilting angle. It is shown that the difference
between I_c^{CF} and I_c^T is essential at field |B_\parallel|\lesssim \phi_0/d
\lambda_J, where \phi_0 is the flux quantum, d is the interlayer distance, and
\lambda_J is the Josephson length. At larger B_\parallel the critical currents
I_c^{CF} and I_c^T almost coincide each other.

made it possible to follow across the phase diagram the behaviour of the
detected coherent acoustic wave, whose average value and lifetime depend on the
thermodynamic phase and on the correlated electron density of states. It is
also shown how coherent lattice oscillations can play an important role in some
changes affecting the ultrafast electronic peak relaxation at the phase
transition, changes which should not be mistakenly attributed to genuine

(4 m wavelength) using the all-sky imaging capabilities of the Long Wavelength
Demonstrator Array (LWDA). The LWDA was a 16-dipole phased array telescope,
located on the site of the Very Large Array in New Mexico. The field of view of
the individual dipoles was essentially the entire sky, and the number of
dipoles was sufficiently small that a simple software correlator could be used
to make all-sky images. From 2006 October to 2007 February, we conducted an
all-sky transient search program, acquiring a total of 106 hr of data; the time
sampling varied, being 5 minutes at the start of the program and improving to 2
minutes by the end of the program. We were able to detect solar flares, and in
a special-purpose mode, radio reflections from ionized meteor trails during the
2006 Leonid meteor shower. We detected no transients originating outside of the
solar system above a flux density limit of 500 Jy, equivalent to a limit of no
more than about 10^{-2} events/yr/deg^2, having a pulse energy density >~ 1.5 x
10^{-20} J/m^2/Hz at 73.8 MHz for pulse widths of about 300 s. This event rate
is comparable to that determined from previous all-sky transient searches, but
at a lower frequency than most previous all-sky searches. We believe that the
LWDA illustrates how an all-sky imaging mode could be a useful operational
model for low-frequency instruments such as the Low Frequency Array, the Long
Wavelength Array station, the low-frequency component of the Square Kilometre

determines the maximum visibility condition. On the other hand, the transport
is fully suppressed at magnetic fields corresponding to half-integer flux

jets (apparent velocity and Doppler factor). We argue that if the motion is
relativistic, the high superluminal velocities are possible only if the
geometrical collimation is smaller than the relativistic beaming angle
$\gamma^{-1}$. In the opposite case, the apparent image will be dominated by
the part of the jet traveling directly towards the observer resulting in a
smaller apparent velocity. Furthermore, getting rid of the homokinetic

Doppler factor, resulting in important consequences for the numerical

In this model, the usual quantum description arises as asymptotics of this

During the first short stage, the wave function goes to one of ""stationary""
values. At the second long stage, the wave function varies in the subspace of
""stationary"" states according to the Schrodinger equation. Further, dissipation
of the process leads to decoherence, and any superposition of states goes to
one of eigenstates of the Hamilton operator. At the last stage, the mixed state
of heat equilibrium (the Gibbs state) arises due to the heat influence of the
medium and the random transitions among the eigenstates of the Hamilton
operator.

uncertainties in the ionization correction factors for unseen ions. We estimate
the amount of oxygen trapped in dust grains for several scenarios of dust
formation. We compare the resulting gas+dust nebular abundances with the
stellar abundances of a sample of 13 B-type stars from the Orion star-forming

  We find that the oxygen nebular abundance based on recombination lines agrees
much better with the stellar abundances than the one derived from the
collisionally excited lines. This result calls for further investigation. If
the CEL/RL abundance discrepancy were caused by temperature fluctuations in the
nebula, as argued by some authors, the same kind of discrepancy should be seen
for the other elements, such as C, N and Ne, which is not what we find in the

has only started to become clear recently through radiation gas dynamical
simulations. However, until now, no simulation has simultaneously included both
magnetic fields and ionizing radiation. Here we present the results from the
first radiation-magnetohydrodynamical (RMHD) simulation including ionization
feedback, comparing an RMHD model of a 1000 M_sol rotating cloud to earlier
radiation gas dynamical models with the same initial density and velocity
distributions. We find that despite starting with a strongly supercritical mass
to flux ratio, the magnetic field has three effects. First, the field offers
locally support against gravitational collapse in the accretion flow,
substantially reducing the amount of secondary fragmentation in comparison to
the gas dynamical case. Second, the field drains angular momentum from the
collapsing gas, further increasing the amount of material available for
accretion by the central, massive, protostar, and thus increasing its final
mass by about 50% from the purely gas dynamical case. Third, the field is wound
up by the rotation of the flow, driving a tower flow. However, this flow never
achieves the strength seen in low-mass star formation simulations for two
reasons: gravitational fragmentation disrupts the circular flow in the central
regions where the protostars form, and the expanding H II regions tend to
further disrupt the field geometry. Therefore, outflows driven by ionization
heating look likely to be more dynamically important in regions of massive star
formation.

varies with frequency. It is hence necessary to solve for the leakage as a
function of spectral channel. Once this is done however, it is possible to
calibrate these terms to better than 1% accuracy, making it feasible to study
sources that are polarized at the few percent level. We present 610 MHz
polarization images of two extended FR-II radio galaxies, viz. 3C 79 and 3C
265. These were selected from the sample of sources for which the total
polarization fraction at 610 MHz is known from the survey of Conway & Strom

CN-strong stars on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) of globular clusters

this is at odds with the distribution of CN band strengths among first ascent
red giant branch (RGB) stars. Norris et al. proposed that the lack of CN-strong
stars in some clusters is a consequence of a smaller mass of these stars that
cannot evolve through the full AGB phase. In this short paper we found that the
relative frequency of AGB stars can change by a factor of two between different
clusters. We also find a very good correlation between the minimum mass of
stars along the horizontal branch (Gratton et al. 2010) and the relative
frequency of AGB stars, with a further dependence on metallicity. We conclude
that indeed the stars with the smallest mass on the HB cannot evolve through
the full AGB phase, being AGB-manque'. These stars likely had large He and N
content, and large O-depletion. We then argue that there should not be AGB
stars with extreme O depletion, and few of them with a moderate one.

spontaneous symmetry breaking presents non obvious aspects. The first example

chiral molecules. The second case refers to a Dirac field in presence of a
magnetic field. Gusynin, Miransky and Shovkovy have shown that
Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) models, where SSB of chiral symmetry takes place for
the nonlinear coupling over a certain threshold, in presence of a magnetic
field exhibit SSB for any value of the coupling. They called this phenomenon
magnetic catalysis. I will discuss this problem in 2 + 1 dimensions from an
operatorial point of view and show that the basic phenomenon is a double
pairing induced by the magnetic field in the vacuum for any value of the mass.
This pairing provides the environment responsible for chiral symmetry breaking
in NJL models with very weak nonlinearities. The third case illustrates briefly
SSB in stationary nonequilibrium states and its possible relevance in natural

of recovering of a potential by two spectra. We associate with this problem the
map $F:\, W^\theta_2\to l_B^\theta,\ F(\sigma) =\{s_k\}_1^\infty$, where
$W^\theta_2 = W^\theta_2[0,\pi]$ are Sobolev spaces with $\theta\geqslant 0$,
$\sigma=\int q$ is a primitive of the potential $q$ and $l_B^\theta$ are
special Hilbert spaces which we construct to place in the regularized spectral
data $\bold s = \{s_k\}_1^\infty$. The properties of the map $F$ are studied in
details. The main result is the theorem on uniform stability. It gives uniform

-\sigma_1\|_\theta$ by the norm of the difference of the regularized spectral

Peierls transition for the extended Hubbard model coupled to quantized phonons.
Following our earlier work on spin-Peierls systems, we use a phonon spectrum
that interpolates between a gapped, dispersionless (Einstein) limit to a
gapless, dispersive (Debye) limit to investigate the entire frequency range. A
variety of theoretical probes are used to determine the quantum phase
transition, including energy gap crossing, a finite size scaling analysis, and
bipartite quantum entanglement. All these probes indicate that a transition of
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless-type is observed at a non-zero electron-phonon
coupling, $g_{\text c}$, for a non-vanishing electron-electron interaction. An
extrapolation from the Einstein limit to the Debye limit is accompanied by an
increase in $g_{\text c}$ for a fixed optical ($q=\pi $) phonon gap. We
therefore conclude that the dimerized ground state is more unstable with
respect to Debye phonons, with the introduction of phonon dispersion
renormalizing the effective electron-lattice coupling for the Peierls-active
mode. By varying the Coulomb interaction, $U$, we observe a generalized Peierls
transition, intermediate to the uncorrelated ($U=0$) and spin-Peierls
($U\to\infty$) limits, where $U$ is the Hubbard Coulomb parameter. Using the
extended Hubbard model with Debye phonons, we investigate the Peierls
transition in \textit{trans}-polyacetylene and show that the transition is
close to the critical regime.

reducing spectral noise to a minimum. Projected rotational velocities vsini are

  Two independent projects in formalization of mathematical content showed that
many of the time consuming tasks could be significantly reduced if adequate
tool support were available. It was also established that similar tasks are
typical for object oriented languages and that they are to a large extent
solved by Integrated Development Environments (IDE).
  This thesis starts by analyzing the opportunities where formalization process
can benefit from software support. A list of research questions is compiled
along with a set of software requirements which are then used for developing a
new IDE for the semantic \TeX{} (\stex{}) format. The result of the current

formalization and presents a set of best practices for implementing such IDEs.

previous outputs of a dynamical system into a vector (called a delay coordinate
map) can be a one-to-one mapping of a low-dimensional attractor from the system
state space. However, Takens' theorem is fragile in the sense that even small
imperfections can induce arbitrarily large errors in this attractor
representation. We extend Takens' result to establish deterministic, explicit
and non-asymptotic sufficient conditions for a delay coordinate map to form a
stable embedding in the restricted case of linear dynamical systems and
observation functions. Our work is inspired by the field of Compressive Sensing
(CS), where results guarantee that low-dimensional signal families can be
robustly reconstructed if they are stably embedded by a measurement operator.
However, in contrast to typical CS results, i) our sufficient conditions are
independent of the size of the ambient state space, and ii) some system and
measurement pairs have fundamental limits on the conditioning of the embedding
(i.e., how close it is to an isometry), meaning that further measurements
beyond some point add no further significant value. We use several simple
simulations to explore the conditions of the main results, including the
tightness of the bounds and the convergence speed of the stable embedding. We
also present an example task of estimating the attractor dimension from
time-series data to highlight the value of stable embeddings over traditional
Takens' embeddings.

the lensing system to be measured: the mass ratio of the companion to its host,
and the projected separation of the components in units of the Einstein radius.
However, other exotic effects can provide more information about the lensing
system. Orbital motion in the lens is one such effect, which if detected, can
be used to constrain the physical properties of the lens. To determine the
fraction of binary lens lightcurves affected by orbital motion (the detection
efficiency) we simulate lightcurves of orbiting binary star and star-planet
(planetary) lenses and simulate the continuous, high-cadence photometric
monitoring that will be conducted by the next generation of microlensing
surveys that are beginning to enter operation. The effect of orbital motion is
measured by fitting simulated lightcurve data with standard static binary
microlensing models; lightcurves that are poorly fit by these models are
considered to be detections of orbital motion. We correct for systematic false
positive detections by also fitting the lightcurves of static binary lenses.
For a continuous monitoring survey without intensive follow-up of high
magnification events, we find the orbital motion detection efficiency for
planetary events with caustic crossings to be 0.061+-0.010, consistent with
observational results, and 0.0130+-0.0055 for events without caustic crossings
(smooth events). Similarly for stellar binaries, the orbital motion detection
efficiency is 0.098+-0.011 for events with caustic crossings and is
0.048+-0.006 for smooth events. These result in combined (caustic crossing and
smooth) orbital motion detection efficiencies of 0.029+-0.005 for planetary
lenses and 0.070+-0.006 for stellar binary lenses. We also investigate how
various microlensing parameters affect the orbital motion detectability.

present an analysis of radio spectral properties in total intensity and

the 5808 extragalactic sources in the survey catalogue of confirmed sources
over the whole Southern sky excluding the strip at Galactic latitude
|b|<1.5deg. The sample has a flux density limit of 40 mJy. Completeness has
been measured as a function of scan region and flux density. Averaging over the
whole survey area the follow-up survey is 78% complete above 50mJy and 93%
complete above 100mJy. 3332 sources with declination <-15deg have good quality
almost simultaneous observations at 4.8, 8.6, and 20GHz. The spectral analysis
shows that the sample is dominated by flat-spectrum sources. The fraction of
flat-spectrum sources decreases from 81% for 20GHz flux densities S>500mJy, to
60% for S<100mJy. There is also a clear spectral steepening at higher
frequencies with the median spectral index decreasing from -0.16 between 4.8
and 8.6GHz to -0.28 between 8.6 and 20GHz. Simultaneous observations in
polarisation are available for all the sources at all the frequencies. 768
sources have a good quality detection of polarised flux density at 20GHz; 467
of them were also detected in polarisation at 4.8 and/or at 8.6GHz so that it
has been possible to compare the spectral behaviour in total intensity and
polarisation. We have found that the polarised fraction increases slightly with
frequency and decreases with flux density. Cross matches and comparisons have
been made with other catalogues at lower radio frequencies, and in the optical,
X-ray and gamma-ray bands. Redshift estimates are available for 825 sources.

allows us to study the spectral and spatial properties of turbulent motions in
galaxy clusters with unprecedented detail, achieving an maximum available
Reynolds number of the order of R=500-1000 for the largest eddies. The
correlations between the energy of these motions in the Intra Cluster Medium
and the dynamical state of the host systems are studied, and the statistical
properties of turbulent motions and their evolution with time support that
major merger events are responsible for the injection of the bulk of turbulent
kinetic energy inside cluster. Turbulence is found to account for a 20-30 per
cent of the thermal energy in merging clusters, while it accounts for a 5 per
cent in relaxed clusters. A comparison of the energies of turbulence and
motions in our simulated clusters with present upper-limits in real nearby
clusters, recently derived with XMM-Newton (Sanders et al.2010), is provided.
When the same spatial scales of turbulent motions are compared, the data from
simulations result well within the range presently allowed by observations.
Finally, we comment on the possibility that turbulence may accelerate
relativistic particles leading to the formation of giant radio halos in
turbulent (merging) clusters. Based on our simulations we confirm previous
semi-analytical studies that suggest that the fraction of turbulent clusters is
consistent with that of clusters hosting radio halos.

even when restricted to win-lose bimatrix games, remains PPAD-hard (Abbott,
Kane and Valiant (2005)). However, there do exist polynomial time tractable
classes of win-lose bimatrix games - such as, very sparse games (Codenotti,
Leoncini and Resta (2006)) and planar games (Addario-Berry, Olver and Vetta
(2007)).
  We extend the results in the latter work to $K_{3,3}$ minor-free games and a
subclass of $K_5$ minor-free games. Both these classes of games strictly
contain planar games. Further, we sharpen the upper bound to unambiguous
logspace, a small complexity class contained well within polynomial time. Apart
from these classes of games, our results also extend to a class of games that
contain both $K_{3,3}$ and $K_5$ as minors, thereby covering a large and
non-trivial class of win-lose bimatrix games. For this class, we prove an upper
bound of nondeterministic logspace, again a small complexity class within
polynomial time. Our techniques are primarily graph theoretic and use
structural characterizations of the considered minor-closed families.

dedicated to measuring performance of recommender systems. The standard
approach is to assess the quality of a system by means of accuracy related
statistics. However, the specificity of the environments in which recommender
systems are deployed requires to pay much attention to speed and memory
requirements of the algorithms. Unfortunately, it is implausible to assess
accurately the complexity of various algorithms with formal tools. This can be
attributed to the fact that such analyses are usually based on an assumption of
dense representation of underlying data structures. Whereas, in real life the
algorithms operate on sparse data and are implemented with collections
dedicated for them. Therefore, we propose to measure the complexity of
recommender systems with artificial datasets that posses real-life properties.
We utilize recently developed bipartite graph generator to evaluate how
state-of-the-art recommender systems' behavior is determined and diversified by
topological properties of the generated datasets.

attracted by potential -1/r^2), or ""quantum anomaly"", is a well-known issue in
the quantum theory. We demonstrate that the mean-field repulsive nonlinearity
prevents the collapse and thus puts forward a solution to the quantum-anomaly
problem different from that previously developed in the framework of the linear
quantum-field theory. This solution may be realized in the 3D or 2D gas of
dipolar bosons attracted by a central charge, and in the 2D gas of magnetic
dipoles attracted by a current filament. In the 3D setting, the dipole-dipole
interactions are also taken into regard, in the mean-field approximation. In
lieu of the collapse, the cubic nonlinearity creates a 3D ground state (GS),
which does not exist in the respective linear Schroedinger equation (SE). The
addition of the harmonic trap gives rise to a tristability, in the case when
the SE still does not lead to the collapse. In the 2D setting, the cubic
nonlinearity is not strong enough to prevent the collapse; however, the quintic
term does it, creating the GS, as well as its counterparts carrying the angular
momentum (vorticity). Counter-intuitively, such self-trapped 2D modes exist
even in the case of a weakly repulsive potential 1/r^2. In the presence of the
harmonic trap, the 2D quintic model with a weakly repulsive central potential
1/r^2 gives rise to three confined modes, the middle one being unstable,
spontaneously developing into a breather. In both the 3D and 2D cases, the GS
wave functions are found in a numerical form, and also in the form of an
analytical approximation, which is asymptotically exact in the limit of the
large norm.

cardinality of an identifying code in $G$. In this paper, we show that for any
connected identifiable triangle-free graph $G$ on $n$ vertices having maximum
degree $\Delta\geq 3$, $\M(G)\le n-\tfrac{n}{\Delta+o(\Delta)}$. This bound is
asymptotically tight up to constants due to various classes of graphs including
$(\Delta-1)$-ary trees, which are known to have their minimum identifying code
of size $n-\tfrac{n}{\Delta-1+o(1)}$. We also provide improved bounds for
restricted subfamilies of triangle-free graphs, and conjecture that there
exists some constant $c$ such that the bound $\M(G)\le n-\tfrac{n}{\Delta}+c$
holds for any nontrivial connected identifiable graph $G$.

collider with a center-of-mass energy of 500~GeV, and a peak luminosity of $2

Large Hadron Collider, a proton-proton accelerator, and provide precision
measurements, which may help in solving some of the fundamental questions at
the frontier of scientific research, such as the origin of mass and the
possible existence of new principles of nature.
  The linear collider community has set a goal to achieve a precision of
$10^{-4}$ on the luminosity measurement at the ILC. This may be accomplished by
constructing a finely granulated calorimeter, which will measure Bhabha
scattering at small angles. The Bhabha cross-section is theoretically known to
great precision, yet the rate of Bhabha scattering events, which would be
measured by the luminosity detector, will be influenced by beam-beam effects,
and by the inherent energy spread of the collider. The electroweak radiative
effects can be calculated to high precision and partially checked with events
with final state photon radiation by distinguishing between the observable
energy deposits of electrons and of photons in the luminosity calorimeter,
using a clustering algorithm.
  In order to achieve the design goal, the geometrical parameters of the
calorimeter need to be reevaluated. This must be done in a generalized manner,
so as to facilitate future modifications, the need for which is foreseen, due
to expected changes in the detector concept.
  This work demonstrates that the clustering approach is viable, and that a
luminosity calorimeter may be designed to match the precision requirements on

this end, these corrections of O(alpha G_F) have been calculated in the
QED-enhanced phenomenological model, incorporating the bound-state mesons as
its degrees of freedom, and matched to a similar calculation on the level of
constituent partons in the full Standard Model. Consequently, the effects
arising due to corrections of the partial decay widths on the extraction of the
CKM matrix elements |V_cb| and |V_ub| are detailed. Further, the results of two
independent Monte-Carlo implementations are presented: One is the dedicated,
strict fixed-order generator BLOR, and the other is embedded into the generic
Yennie-Frautschi-Suura-type resummation of Photons++, which is part of the
multi-purpose event generator Sherpa. The resulting distributions are compared
against the standard tool used in many experimental analyses, PHOTOS, showing
improvements on the shapes of kinematic distributions of both the lepton and
the final state meson.

collaborators and me, of infrared divergences and Bremsstrahlung in one-loop
gluon scattering probabilities in lightcone gauge. In that work, we showed that
adding soft and collinear gluon radiation, satisfying simple Lorentz invariant
constraints, not only cancelled all IR divergences, but resulted in compact
expressions for the consequent scattering probabilities. Here we impose less
restrictive (albeit noncovariant) constraints on the unobserved radiation,
which increases the high energy (s) fixed momentum transfer (t) behavior of the
total probabilities from -ln^2s to ln s ln t, a behavior shared by the (IR
divergent) elastic probabilities. Using this new treatment we also make a much
more detailed comparison of the lightcone results to covariant calculations
using dimensional regularization, finding complete agreement between the two
styles of calculation.

the Randall-Sundrum framework. Relative to other works with light hidden
sectors, the main new feature is a tower of hidden Kaluza-Klein vectors that
kinetically mix with the Standard Model photon and Z. We investigate the decay
properties of the hidden sector fields in some detail, and develop an approach
for calculating processes initiated on the ultraviolet brane of a warped space
with large injection momentum relative to the infrared scale. Using these
results, we determine the detailed bounds on the light warped hidden sector
from precision electroweak measurements and low-energy experiments. We find
viable regions of parameter space that lead to significant production rates for
several of the hidden Kaluza-Klein vectors in meson factories and fixed-target
experiments. This offers the possibility of exploring the structure of an extra
spacetime dimension with lower-energy probes.

The model
consists of the MSSM particle content plus three copies of 24 superfields. The
fermionic part of the SU(2) triplet contained in the 24 is responsible for the
type-III seesaw, which is used to explain the observed neutrino masses and
mixings. Complete copies of 24 are introduced to maintain gauge coupling
unification. These additional states change the beta functions of the gauge
couplings above the seesaw scale. Using mSUGRA boundary conditions we calculate
the resulting supersymmetric mass spectra at the electro-weak scale using full
2-loop renormalization group equations. We show that the resulting spectrum can
be quite different compared to the usual mSUGRA spectrum. We discuss how this
might be used to obtain information on the seesaw scale from mass measurements.
Constraints on the model space due to limits on lepton flavour violating decays
are discussed. The main constraints come from the bounds on the decay mu to e
and gamma but there are also regions where the decay tau to mu and gamma gives
stronger constraints. We also calculate the regions allowed by the dark matter
constraint. For the sake of completeness, we compare our results with those for
the supersymmetric seesaw type-II and, to some extent, with type-I.
