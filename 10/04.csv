presence of a third party (called the adversary), which is enabled to choose
the channel from a given set of memoryless but non-stationary channels without
informing the legitimate sender and receiver about the particular choice that
he made. This channel model is called arbitrarily varying quantum channel
(AVQC). We derive a quantum version of Ahlswede's dichotomy for classical
arbitrarily varying channels. This includes a regularized formula for the
common randomness-assisted capacity for entanglement transmission of an AVQC.
Quite surprisingly and in contrast to the classical analog of the problem
involving the maximal and average error probability, we find that the capacity
for entanglement transmission of an AVQC always equals its strong subspace
transmission capacity. These results are accompanied by different notions of
symmetrizability (zero-capacity conditions) as well as by conditions for an
AVQC to have a capacity described by a single-letter formula. In he final part
of the paper the capacity of the erasure-AVQC is computed and some light shed
on the connection between AVQCs and zero-error capacities. Additionally, we
show by entirely elementary and operational arguments motivated by the theory
of AVQCs that the quantum, classical, and entanglement-assisted zero-error
capacities of quantum channels are generically zero and are discontinuous at
every positivity point.

consistent with general thermodynamic laws. Unlike traditional economic models,
civilization is viewed only as a well-mixed global whole with no distinction
made between individual nations, economic sectors, labor, or capital
investments. At the model core is an observationally supported hypothesis that
the global economy's current rate of primary energy consumption is tied through
a constant to a very general representation of its historically accumulated
wealth. Here, this growth model is coupled to a linear formulation for the
evolution of globally well-mixed atmospheric CO2 concentrations. While very
simple, the coupled model provides faithful multi-decadal hindcasts of
trajectories in gross world product (GWP) and CO2. Extending the model to the
future, the model suggests that the well-known IPCC SRES scenarios
substantially underestimate how much CO2 levels will rise for a given level of
future economic prosperity. For one, global CO2 emission rates cannot be
decoupled from wealth through efficiency gains. For another, like a long-term
natural disaster, future greenhouse warming can be expected to act as an
inflationary drag on the real growth of global wealth. For atmospheric CO2
concentrations to remain below a ""dangerous"" level of 450 ppmv, model forecasts
suggest that there will have to be some combination of an unrealistically rapid
rate of energy decarbonization and nearly immediate reductions in global
civilization wealth. Effectively, it appears that civilization may be in a
double-bind. If civilization does not collapse quickly this century, then CO2
levels will likely end up exceeding 1000 ppmv; but, if CO2 levels rise by this
much, then the risk is that civilization will gradually tend towards collapse.

regions (NRs) above the critical temperature T_c in the high-T_c superconductor
Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O_{8+\delta}. It has been found that, as the temperature lowers,
the NRs expand in the bulk superconducting state consisted of inhomogeneities.
The fact that the size of the inhomogeneity [2] is close to the minimal size of
the NR [1] leads to a conclusion that the superconducting phase is a result of
these overlapped NRs. In the present paper we perform the charge and
percolation regime analysis of NRs and show that at the first critical doping
x_{c1}, when the superconductivity starts on, each NR carries the positive
electric charge one in units of electron charge, thus we attribute the NR to a
single hole boson, and the percolation lines connecting these bosons emerge. At
the second critical doping x_{c2}, when the superconductivity disappears, our
analysis demonstrates that the charge of each NR equals two. The origin of
x_{c2} can be understood by introducing additional normal phase hole fermions
in NRs, whose concentration appearing above x_{c1} increases smoothly with the
doping and breaks the percolation lines of bosons at x_{c2}. The last one
results in disappearing the bulk bosonic property of the pseudogap (PG) region,
which explains the upper bound for existence of vortices in Nernst effect [3].
Since [1] has demonstrated the absence of NRs at the PG boundary one can
conclude that along this boundary, as well as in x_{c2}, all bosons disappear.
As justification of appearance of single bosons, the bosonization of 2D
fermions is rigorously proven using the concept of anyons. The linear density
dependence of the energy gap between excited fermionic and bosonic ground
states describes the Uemura relation for 2D superconductors.

Seyfert, v) LINER and vi) absorption line galaxies using the standard optical
spectroscopic diagnostic tools. We utilize SED-based star formation rates to
independently quantify the source of radio and FIR emission in our galaxies.
Our results show that Seyfert galaxies have FIR/radio ratios lower than, but
still within the scatter of, the canonical value due to an additional (likely
AGN) contribution to their radio continuum emission. Furthermore, IR-detected
absorption and LINER galaxies are on average strongly dominated by AGN activity
in both their FIR and radio emission; however their average FIR/radio ratio is
consistent with that expected for star forming galaxies. In summary, we find
that most AGN-containing galaxies in our NVSS-IRAS-SDSS sample have FIR/radio
flux ratios indistinguishable from those of the star-forming galaxies that
define the radio-FIR correlation. Thus, attempts to separate AGNs from
star-forming galaxies by their FIR/radio flux ratios alone can separate only a
small fraction of the AGNs, such as the radio-loud quasars.

constant and reservoir temperature. We show that, for two-mode squeezed vacuum
probe states, the quantum-limited accuracy of both parameters can be achieved
simultaneously. Moreover, we show that for both parameters two-mode squeezed
vacuum states are more efficient than either coherent, thermal or single-mode
squeezed states. This suggests that at high energy regimes two-mode squeezed
vacuum states are optimal within the Gaussian setup. This optimality result
indicates a stronger form of compatibility for the estimation of the two
parameters. Indeed, not only the minimum variance can be achieved at fixed
probe states, but also the optimal state is common to both parameters.
Additionally, we explore numerically the performance of non-Gaussian states for
particular parameter values to find that maximally entangled states within
D-dimensional cutoff subspaces perform better than any randomly sampled states
with similar energy. However, we also find that states with very similar
performance and energy exist with much less entanglement than the maximally
entangled ones.

Pseudo-random flow geometry is considered to determine airspace stability in a
more random airspace, where aircraft flows are spread over a given positive
width. The use of this aircraft flow model generates a more realistic flow
geometry. A set of upper bounds on the maximal aircraft deviation during
conflict resolution is derived. Also with this flow geometry it is proven that
these bounds are not symmetric, unlike the symmetric bounds derived in previous
papers for simpler flow configurations. Stability is preserved under sequential

improved to $C_{m}=2^{\frac{m-1}{2}}$ by S. Kaijser and more recently H.
Qu\'{e}ffelec and A. Defant and P. Sevilla-Peris remarked that
$C_{m}=(\frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}})^{m-1}$ also works. The Bohnenblust--Hille
inequality also holds for real Banach spaces with the constants
$C_{m}=2^{\frac{m-1}{2}}$. In this note we show that a recent new proof of the
Bohnenblust--Hille inequality (due to Defant, Popa and Schwarting) provides, in
fact, quite better estimates for $C_{m}$ for all values of $m \in \mathbb{N}$.
In particular, we will also show that, for real scalars, if $m$ is even with
$2\leq m\leq 24$, then $$C_{\mathbb{R},m}=2^{1/2}C_{\mathbb{R},m/2}.$$ We will
mainly work on a paper by Defant, Popa and Schwarting, giving some remarks
about their work and explaining how to, numerically, improve the previously
mentioned constants.

elliptical weight function to measure background galaxy images. In doing so, we
introduce a new concept of ""zero plane"" which is an imaginal source plane where
shapes of all sources are perfect circles, and regard the intrinsic shear as
the result of an imaginal lensing distortion. This makes the relation between
the observed shear, the intrinsic shear and lensing distortion more simple and
thus higher-order calculation more easy. The elliptical weight function allows
us to measure the mutiplemoment of shape of background galaxies more precisely
by weighting highly to brighter parts of image and moreover to reduce
systematic error due to insufficient expansion of the weight function in the
original approach of KSB. Point Spread Function(PSF) correction in E-HOLICs
methods becomes more complicated than those in KSB methods. In this paper we
studied isotropic PSF correction in detail. By adopting the lensing distortion
as the ellipticity of the weight function, we are able to show that the shear
estimation in E-HOLICs method reduces to solve a polynomial in the absolute
magnitude of the distortion. We compare the systematic errors between our
approach and KSB using STEP2 simulation. It is confirmed that KSB method
overestimate the input shear for images with large ellipticities, and E-HOLICs
correctly estimate the input shear even for such images. Anisotropic PSF
correction and analysis of real data will be presented in forthcoming paper.

slightly redder than average for its metallicity, but it is likely not
unusually young compared to other clusters of the halo. The new constraints on

9.3e18/cm3, showing a clear doping dependence. Samples with higher doping
concentrations displayed higher oxidation rates. The results were interpreted
using a modified Deal-Grove model. Linear and parabolic rate constants and

parabolic rate constant pre-exponential factor from 10e9m2/s to 10e6m2/s. The
increase in linear rate constant was attributed to defects from doping-induced
lattice mismatch, which tend to be more reactive than bulk crystal regions. The
increase in the diffusion-limited parabolic rate constant was attributed to
degradation in oxide quality originating from the doping-induced lattice
mismatch. This degradation was confirmed by the observation of a decrease in
optical density of the grown oxide films from 1.4 to 1.24. The linear
activation energy varied from 1.6eV to 2.8eV, while the parabolic activation
energy varied from 2.7eV to 3.3eV, increasing with doping concentration. These
increased activation energies were attributed to higher nitrogen content,
leading to an increase in effective bond energy stemming from the difference in
C-Si (2.82eV) and Si-N (4.26eV) binding energies. This work provides crucial
information in the engineering of SiO2 dielectrics for SiC MOS structures,

thermal fluctuation. In order to account for this effect, the
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation includes a thermal fluctuation field and
literature often utilizes the fluctuation-dissipation theorem to characterize
statistical properties of the thermal fluctuation field. However, the theorem
is not applicable to the system under finite current since it is not in
equilibrium. To examine the effect of finite current on the thermal
fluctuation, we adopt the influence functional formalism developed by Feynman
and Vernon, which is known to be a useful tool to analyze effects of
dissipation and thermal fluctuation. For this purpose, we construct a quantum
mechanical effective Hamiltonian describing current-induced domain wall motion
by generalizing the Caldeira-Leggett description of quantum dissipation. We
find that even for the current-induced domain wall motion, the statistical
properties of the thermal noise is still described by the
fluctuation-dissipation theorem if the current density is sufficiently lower
than the intrinsic critical current density and thus the domain wall tilting
angle is sufficiently lower than pi/4. The relation between our result and a
recent result, which also addresses the thermal fluctuation, is discussed. We
also find interesting physical meanings of the Gilbert damping alpha and the
nonadiabaticy parameter beta; while alpha characterizes the coupling strength
between the magnetization dynamics (the domain wall motion in this paper) and
the thermal reservoir (or environment), beta characterizes the coupling
strength between the spin current and the thermal reservoir.

We find that, although the inclusion of the time asymmetry parameter increases
the efficiency value up to a certain extent, for the present case this increase

interference alignment (IA). The connections between the two problems become
apparent when we restate IA as an optimization problem. Specifically, we

The data utilized is from a new reduction that preserves the full spatial

enough to serve two users simultaneously. To this end, we propose a setup
composed of two elements: an X-ray mirrors pair for X-ray beam deflection, and
a 4 m-long magnetic chicane, which creates an offset for mirrors pair
installation in the middle of the baseline undulator. The insertable mirrors
pair can separate spatially the X-ray beams generated in the first and in the
second half of the baseline undulator. Rapid switching of the FEL amplification
process allows deactivating one half and activating another half of the
undulator. As proposed elsewhere, using a kicker installed upstream of the LCLS
baseline undulator and an already existing corrector in the first half of the
undulator, it is possible to rapidly switch the X-ray beam from one user to
another. We present simulation results for the LCLS baseline, and show that it
is possible to generate two saturated SASE X-ray beams in the whole 0.8-8 keV
photon energy range in the same baseline undulator. These can serve two users.
Our technique does not perturb the baseline mode of operation of the LCLS
undulator. Also, the magnetic chicane setup is very flexible, and can be used
as a self-seeding setup too. We present simulation results for the LCLS
baseline undulator with SHAB. One can produce monochromatic radiation at the
2nd harmonic as well as at the 1st. We describe an efficient way for obtaining
multi-user operation at the LCLS hard X-ray FEL. To this end, a photon beam
distribution system based on the use of crystals in the Bragg reflection
geometry is proposed. The reflectivity of crystal deflectors can be switched
fast enough by flipping the crystals with piezoelectric devices. Monochromatic
hard X-rays can then be distributed among 6 independent experiments, thereby
enabling 6 users to work in parallel in the near and far experimental halls.

compared to the lines deduced from transport measurements (up to 55 T in pulsed

a very strong downward curvature for $T \rightarrow T_c$ which is not visible
in transport measurements. This temperature dependence associated to an upward
curvature of the field dependence of the Sommerfeld coefficient confirm that
$H_{c2}$ is limited by paramagnetic effects. Surprisingly this paramagnetic
limit is visible here up to $T/T_c \sim 0.99$ (for $H\|ab$) which is the
consequence of a very small value of the coherence length $\xi_c(0) \sim 4 \AA$
(and $\xi_{ab}(0) \sim 15 \AA$), confirming the strong renormalisation of the
effective mass (as compared to DMFT calculations) previously observed in ARPES
measurements [Phys. Rev. Lett. 104, 097002 (2010)]. $H_{c1}$ measurements lead
to $\lambda_{ab}(0) = 430 \pm 50$ nm and $\lambda_c(0) = 1600 \pm 200$ nm and
the corresponding anisotropy is approximatively temperature independent ($\sim
4$), being close to the anisotropy of $H_{c2}$ for $T\rightarrow T_c$. The
temperature dependence of both $\lambda$ ($\propto T^2$) and the electronic

systematic uncertainties affecting the cosmological constraints, including
those arising through the training of the supernova model used to fit the

find that a 18 month survey would yield constraints on the dark energy equation
of state comparable to the cosmic shear approach in EUCLID: a variable
two-parameter equation of state can be constrained to ~0.03 at z~0.3. These
constraints are derived from distances to about 13,000 supernovae out to z=1.5,
observed in two cones of 10 and 50 deg^2. These constraints do not require
measuring a nearby supernova sample from the ground. Provided swappable filters
can be accommodated on EUCLID, distances to supernovae can be measured from

sufficiently accurate near the interface under certain limitations. In this
paper a novel coupling that is free from ""ghost forces"" is proposed for a
two-body interaction potential under the assumptions of either (i) one spatial
dimension, or (ii) two spatial dimensions and piecewise affine finite elements
for describing the continuum deformation. The performance of the proposed
coupling is demonstrated with numerical experiments. The coupling strategy is
based on judiciously defining the contributions of the atomistic bonds to the
discrete and the continuum potential energy. The same method in one dimension
has been independently developed and analyzed in Li and Luskin

evolving covariate effects. However, challenges arise when the censoring time
is not always observed and may be covariate-dependent, particularly in the
presence of continuously-distributed covariates. In spite of several recent
advances, existing methods either involve algorithmic complications or impose a
probability grid. The former leads to difficulties in the implementation and
asymptotics, whereas the latter introduces undesirable grid dependence. To
resolve these issues, we develop fundamental and general quantile calculus on
cumulative probability scale in this article, upon recognizing that probability
and time scales do not always have a one-to-one mapping given a survival
distribution. These results give rise to a novel estimation procedure for
censored quantile regression, based on estimating integral equations. A
numerically reliable and efficient Progressive Localized Minimization (PLMIN)
algorithm is proposed for the computation. This procedure reduces exactly to
the Kaplan--Meier method in the $k$-sample problem, and to standard uncensored
quantile regression in the absence of censoring. Under regularity conditions,
the proposed quantile coefficient estimator is uniformly consistent and
converges weakly to a Gaussian process. Simulations show good statistical and
algorithmic performance. The proposal is illustrated in the application to a
clinical study.

modified by the interaction with shielding material, with equipment and even

prediction of single-event-upset rates. To this end, it is necessary to
construct predictive models for nuclear reactions, which usually consist of an

purpose of this work is to prove that the de-excitation model is in fact a

the systematic uncertainty due to the de-excitation model actually dominates

brightenings in the neighborhood of the downflows. The photospheric intensity
also exhibit persistent brightenings comparable to the quiet Sun.
Interestingly, the orientation of the penumbral filaments at the site of the
downflows is similar to that resulting from the reconnection process described
by Ryutova et al. The existence of such downflows in the inner penumbra
represents a challenge for numerical models of sunspots because they have to

spherically symmetric dust-filled spacetime. The LTB solution has two physical
functional degrees of freedom of the radial coordinate. The inverse problem is
constructing an LTB model requiring that the LTB model be consistent with
selected important observational data. In this paper, we assume that the
observer is at the center and consider the distance-redshift relation $\da$ and
the redshift-space mass density $\mu$ as the selected important observational

explicitly show that, for general functional forms of $\da(z)$ and $\mu(z)$,
the regular solution does not necessarily exist in the whole redshift domain.
We also show that the condition for the existence of the regular solution %in
terms of $\da(z)$ and $\mu(z)$ is satisfied by the distance-redshift relation
and the redshift-space mass density in $\Lambda$CDM models. Deriving regular
differential equations for the inverse problem with the distance-redshift

numerically solve them for the case $(\Omega_{\rm

resultant LTB universe model is given. How to solve the inverse problem with
the simultaneous big-bang and a given function $\da(z)$ for the

Effective tight-binding Hamiltonians for the d-bands of LaFeAsO with various

using maximally-localized Wannier orbitals. Local electronic structures around
the impurity are quantitatively characterized by their onsite potential and
transfer hoppings to neighboring sites. We found that the impurities are
classified into three groups according to the derived parameters: For Mn, Co,
and Ni, their impurity-3d levels measured from the Fe-3d level are nearly 0.3
eV, -0.3 eV, and -0.8 eV, respectively, while, for the Zn case, the d level is
considerably deep as -8 eV. For the Ru case, although the onsite-level
difference is much smaller as O(0.1) eV, the transfer integrals around the
impurity site are larger than those of the pure system by 20% \sim 30%, due to
the large spatial spread of the Ru-4d orbitals. We also show that, while excess
carriers are tightly trapped around the impurity site (due to the Friedel sum
rule), there is a rigid shift of band structure near the Fermi level, which has
the same effect as carrier doping.

universal among such a diversity of sources and scales. To address these
questions we have been investigating outflow activity in a sample of
protostellar objects that differ considerably in mass and mass accretion rate.
Central to this is our study of brown dwarf jets. To date Classical T Tauri

mechanism. Here we shall summarise what is understood so far of BD jets and the
important constraints observations can place on models. We will focus on the

study generalized positive functions, i.e with a non-negative real part on the

and we explore two partitionings of this set: (i) into a pair of even and odd
subcics and (ii) to (infinitely many non-invertible) convex cones of functions
with prescribed poles and zeroes in the right half plane. It is then shown that
a positive function can always be written as a sum of even and odd part, only
over the larger set of generalized positive. It is well known that over
positive functions Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation is not always feasible. Over
generalized positive, there is no easy way to carry out this interpolation. The
second partitioning is subsequently exploited to introduce a simple procedure

powders have been milled for different milling periods (6, 24, 48 and 96
hours). The grain sizes of the samples are very close to each other (~ 32 \pm 4
nm). However, the defective state of the samples is different from each other
as manifested from the variation of magnetic properties and electrical
resistivity with milling time. All the samples have been found to be
ferromagnetic with clear hysteresis loops at room temperature. The maximum
value for saturation magnetization (0.11 {\mu}_B / Mn atom) was achieved for 96
hours milled sample. Electrical resistivity has been found to increase with
increasing milling time. The most resistive sample bears the largest saturation
magnetization. Variation of average positron lifetime with milling time bears a
close similarity with that of the saturation magnetization. This indicates the
key role played by open volume vacancy defects, presumably zinc vacancies near
grain surfaces, in inducing ferromagnetic order in Mn doped ZnO. To attain
optimum defect configuration favorable for ferromagnetism in this kind of
samples proper choice of milling period and annealing conditions is required.

galaxy 3C 66B, which is at a distance of only $6^\prime$. The derived integral
flux above $100\eh{GeV}$ is 8.3% of Crab Nebula flux and the energy spectrum is
reproduced by a power law of photon index $3.64 \pm 0.39_{\rm stat} \pm
0.25_{\rm sys}$. Within errors, this is compatible with the one derived by
VERITAS in 2009. From the spectra corrected for absorption by the extragalactic

we applied, and constrain the redshift of the blazar to $z < 0.68$.

additional conditions on the structure of its sparsity pattern. This problem is
relevant in machine learning, statistics and signal processing. It is well
known that a linear regression can benefit from knowledge that the underlying
regression vector is sparse. The combinatorial problem of selecting the nonzero
components of this vector can be ""relaxed"" by regularizing the squared error
with a convex penalty function like the $\ell_1$ norm. However, in many
applications, additional conditions on the structure of the regression vector
and its sparsity pattern are available. Incorporating this information into the
learning method may lead to a significant decrease of the estimation error. In
this paper, we present a family of convex penalty functions, which encode prior
knowledge on the structure of the vector formed by the absolute values of the
regression coefficients. This family subsumes the $\ell_1$ norm and is flexible
enough to include different models of sparsity patterns, which are of practical
and theoretical importance. We establish the basic properties of these penalty
functions and discuss some examples where they can be computed explicitly.
Moreover, we present a convergent optimization algorithm for solving
regularized least squares with these penalty functions. Numerical simulations
highlight the benefit of structured sparsity and the advantage offered by our
approach over the Lasso method and other related methods.

a general framework for network and communication models that encompasses and
unifies the models used previously in this context. We show, in most settings

the topology can change completely at any time. This remains true even if the
network dynamics are controlled by a fully adaptive adversary that knows the
complete network state. Virtually nothing besides simple O(kT) sequential
flooding protocols was previously known for such a setting. While RLNC gossip
works in this wide variety of networks its analysis remains the same and

relaxing from an initial state with non-vanishing order parameter (e.g., the
magnetization in the Ising model), focusing on the dynamics of the global order
parameter of a d'-dimensional manifold. The persistence probability P(t) shows
three distinct long-time decays depending on the value of the parameter \zeta =
(D-2+\eta)/z which also controls the relaxation of the persistence probability
in the case of a disordered initial state (vanishing order parameter) as a
function of the codimension D = d-d' and of the critical exponents z and \eta.
We find that the asymptotic behavior of P(t) is exponential for \zeta > 1,
stretched exponential for 0 <= \zeta <= 1, and algebraic for \zeta < 0. Whereas
the exponential and stretched exponential relaxations are not affected by the
initial value of the order parameter, we predict and observe a crossover
between two different power-law decays when the algebraic relaxation occurs, as
in the case d'=d of the global order parameter. We confirm via Monte Carlo
simulations our analytical predictions by studying the magnetization of a line
and of a plane of the two- and three-dimensional Ising model, respectively,
with Glauber dynamics. The measured exponents of the ultimate algebraic decays
are in a rather good agreement with our analytical predictions for the Ising
universality class. In spite of this agreement, the expected scaling behavior
of the persistence probability as a function of time and of the initial value
of the order parameter remains problematic. In this context, the
non-equilibrium dynamics of the O(n) model in the limit n->\infty and its
subtle connection with the spherical model is also discussed in detail.

execution delay. Data access time depends on bandwidth. The major bottleneck to
supporting fast data access in Grids is the high latencies of Wide Area
Networks and Internet. Effective scheduling can reduce the amount of data
transferred across the internet by dispatching a job to where the needed data
are present. Another solution is to use a data replication mechanism. Objective
of dynamic replica strategies is reducing file access time which leads to
reducing job runtime. In this paper we develop a job scheduling policy and a
dynamic data replication strategy, called HRS (Hierarchical Replication
Strategy), to improve the data access efficiencies. We study our approach and
evaluate it through simulation. The results show that our algorithm has
improved 12% over the current strategies.

Flexible specifications include models in which only mixing probabilities,

the covariates can weaken restrictions on the class of the approximable

conductor/superconductor $(N/S)$ junctions almost universally assume no
effective electron-electron coupling in the $N$ region. While such an
approximation leads to a simple description of the proximity effect, it is
unclear how it could be rigorously justified. We reveal a much more complex
picture of the proximity effect in $N/S$ bilayers, where $S$ is a clean s-wave
BCS superconductor and $N$ is a simple metal with a repulsive effective
electron coupling. We elucidate the proximity effect behavior using a highly
accurate method to self-consistently solve the Bogoliubov-deGennes equations.
We present our results for a wide range of values of the interface scattering,
the Fermi wave vector mismatch, the temperature, and the ratio $g$ of the
effective interaction strengths in the $N$ and $S$ region. We find that the
repulsive interaction, represented by a negative $g$, strongly alters the
signatures of the proximity effect as can be seen in the spatial dependence of
the Cooper pair amplitude and the pair potential, as well as in the local
density of states near the interface.

covariance matrix. Here we consider the case where $N<M$ such that this
estimate is singular and therefore fundamentally bad. We present a radically
new approach to deal with this situation. Let $X$ be the $M\times N$ data
matrix, where the columns are the $N$ independent realizations of the random
vector with covariance matrix $\Sigma$. Without loss of generality, we can
assume that the random variables have zero mean. We would like to estimate
$\Sigma$ from $X$. Let $K$ be the classical sample covariance matrix. Fix a
parameter $1\leq L\leq N$ and consider an ensemble of $L\times M$ random
unitary matrices, $\{\Phi\}$, having Haar probability measure. Pre and post
multiply $K$ by $\Phi$, and by the conjugate transpose of $\Phi$ respectively,
to produce a non--singular $L\times L$ reduced dimension covariance estimate. A
new estimate for $\Sigma$, denoted by $\mathrm{cov}_L(K)$, is obtained by a)
projecting the reduced covariance estimate out (to $M\times M$) through pre and
post multiplication by the conjugate transpose of $\Phi$, and by $\Phi$
respectively, and b) taking the expectation over the unitary ensemble. Another
new estimate (this time for $\Sigma^{-1}$), $\mathrm{invcov}_L(K)$, is obtained
by a) inverting the reduced covariance estimate, b) projecting the inverse out
(to $M\times M$) through pre and post multiplication by the conjugate transpose
of $\Phi$, and by $\Phi$ respectively, and c) taking the expectation over the

model closely related to the discrete time stochastic BES-model. The discrete
time BES-model is underlying current attempts to simulate cortical development,
but is difficult to analyze. The new continuous time formulation facilitates
analytical treatment thus allowing us to examine the structure of the model
more closely. We derive explicit expressions for the time dependent
probabilities p(\gamma, t) for finding a tree \gamma at time t, valid for
arbitrary continuous time branching models with tree and segment dependent
branching rates. We show, for the specific case of the continuous time
BES-model, that as expected from our model formulation, the sums needed to
evaluate expectation values of functions of the terminal segment number
\mu(f(n),t) do not depend on the distribution of the total branching
probability over the terminal segments. In addition, we derive a system of
differential equations for the probabilities p(n,t) of finding n terminal
segments at time t. For the continuous BES-model, this system of differential
equations gives direct numerical access to functions only depending on the
number of terminal segments, and we use this to evaluate the development of the
mean and standard deviation of the number of terminal segments at a time t. For
comparison we discuss two cases where mean and variance of the number of
terminal segments are exactly solvable. Then we discuss the numerical
evaluation of the S-dependence of the solutions for the continuous time
BES-model. The numerical results show clearly that higher S values, i.e. values
such that more proximal terminal segments have higher branching rates than more
distal terminal segments, lead to more symmetrical trees as measured by three

generalized coorbit space theory to treat a wider variety of coorbit spaces. A
unified approach towards atomic decompositions and Banach frames with new
results for general coorbit spaces is presented. In the second part we apply
the abstract setting to a specific framework and study coorbits of what we call
Peetre spaces. They allow to recover inhomogeneous Besov-Lizorkin-Triebel
spaces of various types of interest as coorbits. We obtain several old and new
wavelet characterizations based on precise smoothness, decay, and vanishing
moment assumptions of the respective wavelet. As main examples we obtain
results for weighted spaces (Muckenhoupt, doubling), general 2-microlocal
spaces, Besov-Lizorkin-Triebel-Morrey spaces, spaces of dominating mixed
smoothness, and even mixtures of the mentioned ones. Due to the generality of
our approach, there are many more examples of interest where the abstract
coorbit space theory is applicable.

corrupted by i.i.d. sparse outliers is studied and a very elegant solution,
principal component pursuit, is proposed. It is motivated as a tool for video
surveillance applications with the background image sequence forming the low
rank part and the moving objects/persons/abnormalities forming the sparse part.
Each image frame is treated as a column vector of the data matrix made up of a
low rank matrix and a sparse corruption matrix. Principal component pursuit
solves the problem under the assumptions that the singular vectors of the low
rank matrix are spread out and the sparsity pattern of the sparse matrix is
uniformly random. However, in practice, usually the sparsity pattern and the
signal values of the sparse part (moving persons/objects) change in a
correlated fashion over time, for e.g., the object moves slowly and/or with
roughly constant velocity. This will often result in a low rank sparse matrix.
  For video surveillance applications, it would be much more useful to have a
real-time solution. In this work, we study the online version of the above
problem and propose a solution that automatically handles correlated sparse
outliers. The key idea of this work is as follows. Given an initial estimate of
the principal directions of the low rank part, we causally keep estimating the
sparse part at each time by solving a noisy compressive sensing type problem.
The principal directions of the low rank part are updated every-so-often. In
between two update times, if new Principal Components' directions appear, the
""noise"" seen by the Compressive Sensing step may increase. This problem is
solved, in part, by utilizing the time correlation model of the low rank part.
We call the proposed solution ""Real-time Robust Principal Components' Pursuit"".

  We study the equilibrium states reached by a network whose members increase

infection is widespread (resp. limited). Our main finding is that the
equilibrium level of infection increases as the learning rate of the members
increases. We confirm this result in three scenarios for the behavior of the

rational but split into two response classes. In the first two cases, we
completely characterize the stability and the domains of attraction of the

enriched gas has been transported out of the central galaxy through the action
of the radio source. We estimate the excess mass of iron in the entrained gas

this gas to its current location is ~4.5x10^57 erg, a significant fraction of

is localised around the `neutral line' where the background field vanishes.
Rotation acts to reduce the effect of this instability. Polar-led perturbations

whose restoring force is the magnetic field. In a rotating magnetised star
there are no pure Alfv\'en modes or pure inertial modes, but hybrids of these.

coding, which has been reported to provide significant performance gains in
practical wireless networks. The performance of this scheme strongly depends on
the network topology and thus on the locations of the wireless nodes. Also, it
has been shown previously that finding the encoding strategy, which achieves
maximum performance, requires complex calculations to be undertaken by the
wireless node in real-time.
  Both deterministic and random point pattern are explored and using the
Boolean connectivity model we provide upper bounds for the maximum coding
number, i.e., the number of packets that can be combined such that the
corresponding receivers are able to decode. For the models studied, this upper
bound is of order of $\sqrt{N}$, where $N$ denotes the (mean) number of
neighbors. Moreover, achievable coding numbers are provided for grid-like
networks. We also calculate the multiplicative constants that determine the
gain in case of a small network. Building on the above results, we provide an
analytic expression for the upper bound of the efficiency of local network
coding. The conveyed message is that it is favorable to reduce computational
complexity by relying only on small encoding numbers since the resulting
expected throughput loss is negligible.

dynamical equation of field, differential formalism and integral formalism. The
importance of this fact is firstly emphasized by Yang in case of gauge field
[Phys. Rev. Lett. 33 (1974) 445], where the fact has given rise to a deeper
understanding for Aharonov-Bohm phase and magnetic monopole [Phys. Rev. D. 12
(1975) 3845]. In this paper we shall point out that such a fact also holds in
general wave function of matter, it may give rise to a deeper understanding for
Berry phase. Most importantly, we shall prove a point that, for general wave
function of matter, in the adiabatic limit, there is an intrinsic difference
between its integral formalism and differential formalism. It is neglect of
this difference that leads to an inconsistency of quantum adiabatic theorem
pointed out by Marzlin and Sanders [Phys. Rev. Lett. 93 (2004) 160408]. It has
been widely accepted that there is no physical difference of using differential
operator or integral operator to construct the dynamical equation of field.
Nevertheless, our study shows that the Schrodinger differential equation (i.e.,
differential formalism for wave function) shall lead to vanishing Berry phase
and that the Schrodinger integral equation (i.e., integral formalism for wave
function), in the adiabatic limit, can satisfactorily give the Berry phase.
Therefore, we reach a conclusion: There are two ways of describing physical
reality, differential formalism and integral formalism; but the integral
formalism is a unique way of complete description.

rotating black hole that accretes a collisionless fluid. The solution is
conformally stationary, axisymmetric, and conformally separable, possessing a
conformal Killing tensor. Hyper-relativistic counter-streaming between
collisionless ingoing and outgoing streams drives inflation at (just above) the
inner horizon, followed by collapse. As ingoing and outgoing streams approach
the inner horizon, they focus into twin narrow beams directed along the ingoing
and outgoing principal null directions, regardless of the initial angular
motions of the streams. The radial energy-momentum of the counter-streaming
beams gravitationally accelerates the streams even faster along the principal
directions, leading to exponential growth in the streaming density and
pressure, and in the Weyl curvature and mass function. At exponentially large
density and curvature, inflation stalls, and the spacetime collapses. As the
spacetime collapses, the angular motions of the freely-falling streams grow.
When the angular motion has become comparable to the radial motion, which
happens when the conformal factor has shrunk to an exponentially tiny scale,
conformal separability breaks down, and the solution fails. The condition of
conformal separability prescribes the form of the ingoing and outgoing
accretion flows incident on the inner horizon. The dominant radial part of the
solution holds provided that the densities of ingoing and outgoing streams
incident on the inner horizon are uniform, independent of latitude; that is,
the accretion flow is ""monopole."" The sub-dominant angular part of the solution
requires a special non-radial pattern of angular motion of streams incident on
the inner horizon. The prescribed angular pattern cannot be achieved if the
collisionless streams fall freely from outside the horizon.

conformally stationary, axisymmetric, conformally separable solutions presented
for uncharged rotating black holes in a companion paper. In the present paper,
the collisionless fluid accreted by the black hole may be charged. The charge
of the black hole is determined self-consistently by the charge accretion rate.
As in the uncharged case, hyper-relativistc counter-streaming between ingoing
and outgoing streams drives inflation at (just above) the inner horizon,
followed by collapse. If both ingoing and outgoing streams are charged, then
conformal separability holds during early inflation, but fails as inflation
develops. If conformal separability is imposed throughout inflation and
collapse, then only one of the ingoing and outgoing streams can be charged: the
other must be neutral. Conformal separability prescribes a hierarchy of
boundary conditions on the ingoing and outgoing streams incident on the inner
horizon. The dominant radial boundary conditions require that the incident
ingoing and outgoing number densities be uniform with latitude, but the charge
per particle must vary with latitude such that the incident charge densities
vary in proportion to the radial electric field. The sub-dominant angular
boundary conditions require specific forms of the incident number- and
charge-weighted angular motions. If the streams fall freely from outside the
horizon, then the prescribed angular conditions can be achieved by the charged
stream, but not by the neutral stream. Thus, as in the case of an uncharged
black hole, the neutral stream must be considered to be delivered ad hoc to
just above the inner horizon.
