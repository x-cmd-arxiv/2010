  droplet",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Vaporization of liquid droplets containing particles has been studied
extensively for its applications in combustion, thermal coating, ink-jet
printing, spray cooling, drug delivery, and surface patterning. Droplets
containing solid particles show a preferential solute-migration during drying
process. Recently we carried out experiments with vaporizing droplet suspended
in an acoustic levitator. In this work, we present detailed study of a laser
irradiated droplet containing nanosilica particles. Infrared and High speed
imaging of the heating process for different concentrations of nanosilica
revealed an interesting solute migration pattern. Further investigation with
Particle Image Velocimetry shows presence of strong recirculation within the
levitated droplet. It also reveals that with increasing viscosity of the liquid
the strength of this recirculation decreases. Due to the droplets rotation
about the levitator axis, a centrifugal force also dominated the flow field
within the droplet. High speed imaging shows that initial stage of heating is
dominated by sharper diameter reduction. At the end of this stage the droplet
takes a bowl shape. Next stage, which is termed as structure formation shows
different characteristics for higher and lower concentrations. For nanosilica
concentration of less than 1.3%, the bowl shape remains unaltered with further
heating. On the other hand, for concentration greater than 1.9%, due to
stronger centrifugal effect than recirculation, the particles migrate towards
the equator plane creating horizontal ring structure. The horizontal ring very
soon starts oscillating about the levitator axis. This creates an imbalance of
forces resulting in reorientation of the ring. Thus a vertical ring is created.

spectrum E(k). The longitudinal component E_c(k) exhibits over a limited range
a Kolgomorov-like scaling k^{-5/3}, whilst the solenoidal power spectrum
component E_s(k) is strongly influenced by numerical resolution effects. The
dependence of the spectra E(k) on dissipative effects is found to be
significant at length scales 100-300Kpc, with viscous damping of the velocities
being less pronounced in those runs with the lowest artificial viscosity. The
turbulent energy density radial profile E_{turb}(r) is strongly affected by the
numerical viscosity scheme adopted in the simulations, with the
turbulent-to-total energy density ratios being higher in the runs with the
lowest artificial viscosity settings and lying in the range between a few
percent and ~10%. These values are in accord with the corresponding ratios
extracted from previous cluster simulations realized using mesh-based codes. At
large cluster radii, the mass correction terms to the hydrostatic equilibrium
equation are little affected by the numerical viscosity of the simulations,
showing that the X-ray mass bias is already estimated well in standard SPH
simulations. Finally, simulations in which the gas can cool radiatively are
characterized by the presence in the cluster inner regions of high levels of

highlighting the tight constraints that analysis of the trajectories of tidal
streams can place on the form of the Galactic potential.
  We address the reconstruction of orbits from observations of tidal streams.
We upgrade the scheme reported by Binney (2008) and Jin & Lynden-Bell (2007),
which reconstructs orbits from streams using radial-velocity measurements, to
allow it to work with erroneous input data. The upgraded algorithm can correct
for both statistical error on observations, and systematic error due to streams
not delineating individual orbits, and given high-quality but realistic input
data, it can diagnose the potential with considerable accuracy.
  We complement the work of Binney (2008) by deriving a new algorithm, which
reconstructs orbits from streams using proper-motion data rather than radial
velocities. We show that the new algorithm has a similar potency for diagnosing
the Galactic potential.
  We explore the concept of Galactic parallax, which arises in connection with
our proper-motion study. Galactic parallax allows trigonometric distance
calculation to stars at 40 times the range of conventional parallax, although
its applicability is limited to only those stars in tidal streams.
  We examine from first principles the mechanics of tidal stream formation and
propagation. We find that the mechanics of tidal streams has a natural
expression in terms of action-angle variables. We find that tidal streams in
realistic galaxy potentials will generally not delineate orbits, and that
attempting to constrain the Galactic potential by assuming that they do can
lead to large systematic error. We show that we can accurately predict the
real-space trajectories of streams, even when they differ significantly from
orbits.

with their wall crossing formulas. The hyperkahler metric of a Hitchin's moduli
space can be put into an instanton-corrected form according to physicists
Gaiotto, Moore and Neitzke. The problem boils down to the construction of a set
of special coordinates which can be constructed as Fock-Goncharov coordinates
associated with foliations of quadratic differentials on a Riemann surface. A
wall crossing formula of Kontsevich and Soibelman arises both as a crucial
consistency condition and an effective computational tool. On the other hand
Gross and Siebert have succeeded in determining instanton corrections of
complex structures of Calabi-Yau varieties in the context of mirror symmetry
from a singular affine structure with additional data. We will show that the
two instanton correction problems are equivalent in an appropriate sense via
the identification of the wall crossing formulas in the metric problem with
consistency conditions in the complex structure problem. This result provides
examples of Calabi-Yau varieties where the instanton correction (in the sense
of mirror symmetry) of metrics and complex structures can be determined.

modes in an unexplored range of 1690-2150 cm-1 in nonsuspended commensurate
(AB-stacked), incommensurate (folded) and suspended graphene layers. Based on
the double resonance theory, four dominant modes in this range have been
assigned as 2oTO (M band), iTA+LO, iTO+LA and LO+LA. Differing to AB-stacked
bilayer graphene or few layer graphene, the M band disappears in single layer
graphene. Systematic analysis reveals that interlayer interaction is essential
for the presence (or absence) of M band whereas the substrate has no effect on
this. Dispersive behaviors of these ""new"" Raman modes in graphene have been
probed by the excitation energy dependent Raman spectroscopy. It is found that
the appearance of the M band strictly relies on the AB stacking, which could be
a fingerprint of AB-stacked bilayer graphene. This work expands the unique and
powerful abilities of Raman spectroscopy on study of graphene and provides
another effective way to probe phonon dispersion, electron-phonon coupling, and
to exploit electronic band structure of graphene layers.

phases of dense hydrogen at pressures up to 3.5 TPa are systematically
investigated with density functional theory. The results indicate that the
Vinet EOS model that fitted to low-pressure experimental data overestimates the
compressibility of dense hydrogen drastically when beyond 500 GPa. Metastable
multi-atomic molecular phases with weak covalent bonds are observed. When
compressed beyond about 2.8 TPa, these exotic low-coordinated phases become
competitive with the groundstate and other high-symmetry atomic phases. Using
nudged elastic band method, the transition path and the associated energy
barrier between these high-pressure phases are evaluated. In particular for the
case of dissociation of diatomic molecular phase into the atomic metallic Cs-IV
phase, the existent barrier might raise the transition pressure about 200 GPa
at low temperatures. Plenty of flat and broad basins on the energy surface of
dense hydrogen have been discovered, which should take a major responsibility
for the highly anharmonic zero point vibrations of the lattice, as well as the
quantum structure fluctuations in some extreme cases. At zero pressure, our
analysis demonstrates that all of these atomic phases of dense hydrogen known
so far are unquenchable.
  NOTE: In the previous version of this paper (1010.3392v1) we made a mistake
when evaluating the enthalpy of Cs-IV phase, which misled us to a conclusion
that taking the multi-atomic molecular phases as the ground-state. After
corrected this error, however, the atomic phase of Cs-IV becomes the static
structure with the lowest enthalpy. Current version not only includes a
substantial improvement of the previous one, but also contains many NEW
interesting topics that were not touched before.

recently as it enables a wide set of location based services. RSSI-based
techniques have been the preferred method for GSM localization on the handset
as RSSI information is available in all cell phones. Although the GSM standard
allows for a cell phone to receive signal strength information from up to seven
cell towers, many of today's cell phones are low-end phones, with limited API
support, that gives only information about the associated cell tower. In
addition, in many places in the world, the density of cell towers is very small
and therefore, the available cell tower information for localization is very
limited. This raises the challenge of accurately determining the cell phone
location with very limited information, mainly the RSSI of the associated cell
tower. In this paper we propose a Hidden Markov Model based solution that
leverages the signal strength history from only the associated cell tower to
achieve accurate GSM localization. We discuss the challenges of implementing
our system and present the details of our system and how it addresses the
challenges. To evaluate our proposed system, we implemented it on Androidbased
phones. Results for two different testbeds, representing urban and rural
environments, show that our system provides at least 156% enhancement in median
error in rural areas and at least 68% enhancement in median error in urban
areas compared to current RSSI-based GSM localization systems

case that two superposed states are orthogonal. We also show that when the two
superposed states are not necessarily orthogonal, both lower and bounds are, in
general, tighter than the bounds given in terms of the I-concurrence. An
extension of the results to the case with more than two states in the

Two reasons justify a further look at this subject: 1) One of the
approximations used in [1] is not valid for muonic hydrogen. This amounts to a
shift of the proton's radius by $\sim 3$ of the standard deviations of [1], in
the ""right"" direction of data-reconciliation. In field-theory terms, the error
is a mismatch of renormalization scales. Once corrected, the proton radius
""runs"", much as the QCD coupling ""constant"" does. 2) The result of [1] requires
a choice of the ""third Zemach moment"". Its published independent determination
is based on an analysis with a $p$-value --the probability of obtaining data
with equal or lesser agreement with the adopted (fit form-factor) hypothesis--
of $3.92\times 10^{-12}$. In this sense, this quantity is not empirically
known. Its value would regulate the level of ""tension"" between muonic- and
ordinary-hydrogen results, currently {\it at most} $\sim 4\sigma$. There is no
tension between the results of [1] and the proton radius determined with help
of the analyticity of its form factors.
