statistics and reduced systematics. Fundamental questions remain regarding the
origins of cosmic rays both within the Galaxy and in extragalactic sources, and
new puzzles have arisen at ultra-high energies. A key issue is determining the
elemental composition based on air shower measurements. Accelerator experiments
at the LHC, with comprehensive measurements in the forward direction and high
interaction energies, will greatly reduce the uncertainty in air shower
simulations. Ultra-high energy air showers may reveal properties of particle
interactions at energies far beyond the reach of the LHC.

binaries (LMXBs) detected in the elliptical galaxy NGC~4278 with Chandra. Seven
luminous sources were studied individually, four in globular clusters (GCs),
and three in the stellar field. The range of (0.3-8 keV) $L_X$ for these
sources suggests that they may be black hole binaries (BHBs). Comparison of our
results with simulations allows us to discriminate between disk and power-law
dominated emission, pointing to spectral/luminosity variability, reminiscent of
Galactic BHBs. The BH masses derived from a comparison of our spectral results
with the $L_X \sim T^4_{in}$ relation of Galactic BHBs are in the 5-15
$M_{\odot}$ range, as observed in the Milky Way.
  The analysis of joint spectra of sources selected in three luminosity ranges
suggests that while the high luminosity sources have prominent thermal disk
emission components, power-law components are likely to be important in the mid
and low-luminosity spectra. Comparing low-luminosity average spectra, we find a
relatively larger $N_H$ in the GC spectrum; we speculate that this may point to
either a metallicity effect, or to intrinsic physical differences between field
and GC accreting binaries.
  Analysis of average sample properties uncover a previously unreported $L_X -
R_G$ correlation (where $R_G$ is the galactocentric radius) in the GC-LMXB
sample, implying richer LMXB populations in more central GCs. No such trend is
seen in the field LMXB sample. We can exclude that the GC $L_X - R_G$
correlation is the by-product of a luminosity effect, and suggest that it may
be related to the presence of more compact GCs at smaller galactocentric radii,
fostering more efficient binary formation.

vertices into points of the plane, and its edges into continuous curves,
connecting the images of their endpoints. A crossing in such a drawing is a
point where two such curves intersect. In the Minimum Crossing Number problem,
the goal is to find a drawing of G with minimum number of crossings. The value
of the optimal solution, denoted by OPT, is called the graph's crossing number.
This is a very basic problem in topological graph theory, that has received a
significant amount of attention, but is still poorly understood
algorithmically. The best currently known efficient algorithm produces drawings
with $O(\log^2 n)(n + OPT)$ crossings on bounded-degree graphs, while only a
constant factor hardness of approximation is known. A closely related problem
is Minimum Edge Planarization, in which the goal is to remove a
minimum-cardinality subset of edges from G, such that the remaining graph is
planar. Our main technical result establishes the following connection between
the two problems: if we are given a solution of cost k to the Minimum Edge
Planarization problem on graph G, then we can efficiently find a drawing of G
with at most $\poly(d)\cdot k\cdot (k+OPT)$ crossings, where $d$ is the maximum
degree in G. This result implies an $O(n\cdot \poly(d)\cdot
\log^{3/2}n)$-approximation for Minimum Crossing Number, as well as improved
algorithms for special cases of the problem, such as, for example, k-apex and

atmospheric muon neutrino events in IceCube. Boosted decision trees were used
for event selection to reject mis-reconstructed atmospheric muons and obtain a
sample of up-going muon neutrino events. Background contamination in the final
event sample is less than one percent. This is the first measurement of
atmospheric neutrinos up to 400 TeV, and is fundamental to understanding the
impact of this neutrino background on astrophysical neutrino observations with
IceCube. The measured spectrum is consistent with predictions for the
atmospheric muon neutrino plus muon antineutrino flux.

simultaneous relay channel with two users (or two possible channel outcomes)
where for one of them the more suitable strategy is Decode-and-Forward (DF)
while for the other one is Compress-and-Forward (CF). In this setting, it is
assumed that the source wishes to send common and private informations to each
of the users (or channel outcomes). This problem is relevant to: (i) the
transmission of information over the broadcast relay channel (BRC) with
different relaying strategies and (ii) the transmission of information over the
conventional relay channel where the source is oblivious to the coding strategy
of relay. A novel coding that integrates simultaneously DF and CF schemes is
proposed and an inner bound on the capacity region is derived for the case of
general memoryless BRCs. As special case, the Gaussian BRC is studied where it
is shown that by means of the suggested broadcast coding the common rate can be
improved compared to existing strategies. Applications of these results arise
in broadcast scenarios with relays or in wireless scenarios where the source
does not know whether the relay is collocated with the source or with the
destination.

thin clumps. To reconcile investigations of different diagnostics using this
microclumping technique, very low mass-loss rates must be invoked for O stars.
Recently it has been suggested that by using the microclumping approximation
one may actually drastically underestimate the mass-loss rates. Here we
demonstrate this, present a new, improved description of clumpy winds, and show
how corresponding models, in a combined UV and optical analysis, can alleviate
discrepancies between previously derived rates and those predicted by the
line-driven wind theory. Furthermore, we show that the structures obtained in
time-dependent, radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of the intrinsic line-driven
instability of such winds, which are the basis to our current understanding of
clumping, in their present-day form seem unable to provide a fully
self-consistent, simultaneous fit to both UV and optical lines. The reasons for
this are discussed.

high-velocity jet. Given its bright H2O spectra observed with ISO, L1448-mm is
an ideal laboratory to observe heavy water (HDO) emission. Aims: Our aim is to
image the HDO emission in the protostar surroundings, the possible occurrence
of HDO emission also investigating off L1448-mm, towards the molecular outflow.
Methods: We carried out observations of L1448-mm in the HDO(1_10-1_11) line at
80.6 GHz, an excellent tracer of HDO column density, with the IRAM Plateau de
Bure Interferometer. Results: We image for the first time HDO emission around
L1448-mm. The HDO structure reveals a main clump at velocities close to the
ambient one towards the the continuum peak that is caused by the dust heated by
the protostar. In addition, the HDO map shows tentative weaker emission at
about 2000 AU from the protostar towards the south, which is possibly
associated with the walls of the outflow cavity opened by the protostellar
wind. Conclusions: Using an LVG code, modelling the density and temperature
profile of the hot-corino, and adopting a gas temperature of 100 K and a
density of 1.5 10^8 cm^-3, we derive a beam diluted HDO column density of about
7 10^13 cm^-2, corresponding to a HDO abundance of about 4 10^-7. In addition,
the present map supports the scenario where HDO can be efficiently produced in
shocked regions and not uniquely in hot corinos heated by the newly born star.

modes are generated near the magnetopause boundary. One mode, the magnetopause
KH mode, propagates tailward along the magnetopause boundary. The other mode,
the inner KH mode, propagates tailward along the inner edge of the boundary
layer (IEBL). We find large vortical structures associated with the inner KH
mode that are centered on the IEBL. The phase velocities, wavelengths, and
frequencies of the two KH modes are computed. The KH waves are found to be
fairly monochromatic with well defined wavelengths. In addition, the inner and
magnetopause KH modes are coupled and lead to a coupled oscillation of the
low-latitude boundary layer. The boundary layer thickness, $d$, is computed and
we find maximum wave growth for $kd$ = 0.5--1.0, where $k$ is the wave number,

This paper proposes a novel steganography technique for digital color image
which achieves the purported targets. The professed methodology employs a
complete random scheme for pixel selection and embedding of data. Of the three
colour channels (Red, Green, Blue) in a given colour image, the least two
significant bits of any one of the channels of the color image is used to
channelize the embedding capacity of the remaining two channels. We have
devised three approaches to achieve various levels of our desired targets. In
the first approach, Red is the default guide but it results in localization of
MSE in the remaining two channels, which makes it slightly vulnerable. In the
second approach, user gets the liberty to select the guiding channel (Red,
Green or Blue) to guide the remaining two channels. It will increase the
robustness and imperceptibility of the embedded image however the MSE factor
will still remain as a drawback. The third approach improves the performance
factor as a cyclic methodology is employed and the guiding channel is selected
in a cyclic fashion. This ensures the uniform distribution of MSE, which gives
better robustness and imperceptibility along with enhanced embedding capacity.
The imperceptibility has been enhanced by suitably adapting optimal pixel
adjustment process (OPAP) on the stego covers.

wireless networks and data migration in heterogeneous storage systems. We show
that a soft edge coloring approach to both problems gives rigorous
approximation guarantees. In the channel assignment problem arising in wireless
networks a pair of edges incident to a vertex are said to be conflicting if the
channels assigned to them are the same. Our goal is to assign channels (color
edges) so that the number of conflicts is minimized. The problem is NP-hard by
a reduction from Edge coloring and we present two combinatorial algorithms for
this case. The first algorithm is based on a distributed greedy method and
gives a solution with at most $2(1-\frac{1}{k})|E|$ more conflicts than the
optimal solution.The approximation ratio if the second algorithm is $1 +
\frac{|V|}{|E|}$, which gives a ($1 + o(1)$)-factor for dense graphs and is the
best possible unless P = NP. We also consider the data migration problem in
heterogeneous storage systems. In such systems, data layouts may need to be
reconfigured over time for load balancing or in the event of system
failure/upgrades. It is critical to migrate data to their target locations as
quickly as possible to obtain the best performance of the system. Most of the
previous results on data migration assume that each storage node can perform
only one data transfer at a time. However, storage devices tend to have
heterogeneous capabilities as devices may be added over time due to storage
demand increase. We develop algorithms to minimize the data migration time. We
show that it is possible to find an optimal migration schedule when all $c_v$'s
are even. Furthermore, though the problem is NP-hard in general, we give an
efficient soft edge coloring algorithm that offers a rigorous $(1 +
o(1))$-approximation guarantee.

bridge defies gravity even when the beakers are separated at distances up to 2

proposed and discussed for the stability of the bridge and the source of the
flow, revealing an important role of polarization forces on the stability of
the water bridge. On the other hand, the observed flow can only be explained
due to the non negligible free charge present in the surface. In this sense,
the Floating Water Bridge can be considered as an extreme case of a leaky

  Unlabeled Points)",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In image analysis, many tasks require representing two-dimensional (2D)
shape, often specified by a set of 2D points, for comparison purposes. The
challenge of the representation is that it must not only capture the
characteristics of the shape but also be invariant to relevant transformations.
Invariance to geometric transformations, such as translation, rotation, and
scale, has received attention in the past, usually under the assumption that
the points are previously labeled, i.e., that the shape is characterized by an
ordered set of landmarks. However, in many practical scenarios, the points
describing the shape are obtained from automatic processes, e.g., edge or
corner detection, thus without labels or natural ordering. Obviously, the
combinatorial problem of computing the correspondences between the points of
two shapes in the presence of the aforementioned geometrical distortions
becomes a quagmire when the number of points is large. We circumvent this
problem by representing shapes in a way that is invariant to the permutation of
the landmarks, i.e., we represent bags of unlabeled 2D points. Within our
framework, a shape is mapped to an analytic function on the complex plane,
leading to what we call its analytic signature (ANSIG). To store an ANSIG, it
suffices to sample it along a closed contour in the complex plane. We show that
the ANSIG is a maximal invariant with respect to the permutation group, i.e.,
that different shapes have different ANSIGs and shapes that differ by a
permutation (or re-labeling) of the landmarks have the same ANSIG. We further
show how easy it is to factor out geometric transformations when comparing
shapes using the ANSIG representation. Finally, we illustrate these
capabilities with shape-based image classification experiments.

aligned systems, explainable by disk migration. Bayesian model comparison
demonstrates that the current sample of 32 spin-orbit measurements strongly
favors a two-mode migration scenario combining planet-planet scattering and
disk migration over a single-mode Kozai migration scenario. Our analysis
indicates that between 34% and 76% of close-in planets (95% confidence)
migrated via planet-planet scattering. Separately analyzing the subsample of 12

also assess the number of additional hot star spin-orbit measurements that will
likely be necessary to provide a more confident model selection, finding that
an additional 20-30 measurements has a >50% chance of resulting in a

close to the neutrality point is investigated via a numerical computation of
the Kubo formula using a kernel polynomial method. We find that relevant
adsorbate species originate impurity bands in monolayer and bilayer graphene
close to the Dirac point. In the midgap region, a plateau of minimum
conductivity of about $e^2/h$ (per layer) is induced by the resonant disorder.
In bilayer graphene, a large adsorbate concentration can develop an energy gap
between midgap and high-energy states. As a consequence, the conductivity
plateau is supressed near the edges and a ""conductivity gap"" takes place.
Finally, a scattering formalism for electrons in biased bilayer graphene,
taking into account the degeneracy of the spectrum, is developed and the dc

spinning at ~89% of its breakup velocity. This system has been imaged
extensively by interferometric techniques, giving a precise geometric model of
the star's oblateness and the resulting temperature variation on the stellar
surface. Fortuitously, Alpha Oph has a previously known stellar companion, and
characterization of the orbit provides an independent, dynamically-based check
of both the host star and the companion mass. Such measurements are crucial to
constrain models of such rapidly rotating stars. In this study, we combine
eight years of Adaptive Optics imaging data from the Palomar, AEOS, and CFHT
telescopes to derive an improved, astrometric characterization of the companion
orbit. We also use photometry from these observations to derive a model-based
estimate of the companion mass. A fit was performed on the photocenter motion
of this system to extract a component mass ratio. We find masses of
2.40^{0.23}_{0.37} solar masses and 0.85^{0.06}_{0.04} solar masses for Alpha
Oph A and Alpha Oph B, respectively. Previous orbital studies of this system
found a mass too high for this system, inconsistent with stellar evolutionary
calculations. Our measurements of the host star mass are more consistent with
these evolutionary calculations, but with slightly higher uncertainties. In
addition to the dynamically-derived masses, we use IJHK photometry to derive a
model-based mass for Alpha Oph B, of 0.77 +/- 0.05 solar masses marginally
consistent with the dynamical masses derived from our orbit. Our model fits
predict a periastron passage on 2012 April 19, with the two components having a
~50 milliarcsec separation from March to May 2012. A modest amount of
interferometric and radial velocity data during this period could provide a

(SNe Ia) in the near-infrared bands Y and J. These can be used to construct
rest-frame i-band light curves which, when compared to a low-z sample, yield
distance moduli that are less sensitive to extinction and/or decline-rate
corrections than in the optical. However, working with NIR observed and i-band
rest frame photometry presents unique challenges and has necessitated the
development of a new set of observational tools in order to reduce and analyze
both the low-z and high-z CSP sample. We present in this paper the methods used
to generate uBVgriYJH light-curve templates based on a sample of 24
high-quality low-z CSP SNe. We also present two methods for determining the
distances to the hosts of SN Ia events. A larger sample of 30 low-z SNe Ia in
the Hubble Flow are used to calibrate these methods. We then apply the method
and derive distances to seven galaxies that are so nearby that their motions
are not dominated by the Hubble flow.

bar-joint {\em rigidity matroid} of a graph is an important open problem in
combinatorial rigidity theory. Maxwell's condition states that the edges of a
graph $G=(V, E)$ are {\em independent} in its $d$-dimensional generic rigidity
matroid only if $(a)$ the number of edges $|E|$ $\le$ $d|V| - {d+1\choose 2}$,
and $(b)$ this holds for every induced subgraph with at least $d$ vertices. We
call such graphs {\em Maxwell-independent} in $d$ dimensions. Laman's theorem
shows that the converse holds for $d=2$ and thus every maximal
Maxwell-independent set of $G$ has size equal to the rank of the 2-dimensional
generic rigidity matroid. While this is false for $d=3$, we show that every
maximal, Maxwell-independent set of a graph $G$ has size at least the rank of
the 3-dimensional generic rigidity matroid of $G$. This answers a question
posed by Tib\'or Jord\'an at the 2008 rigidity workshop at BIRS
\cite{bib:birs}.
  Along the way, we construct subgraphs (1) that yield alternative formulae for
a rank upper bound for Maxwell-independent graphs and (2) that contain a
maximal (true) independent set. We extend this bound to special classes of
non-Maxwell-independent graphs. One further consequence is a simpler proof of
correctness for existing algorithms that give rank bounds.

of massive stars while short bursts are due to the coalescence of compact
stellar objects. Since the afterglow evolution is determined by the circumburst
density profile, n(r), traversed by the fireball, it can be used to distinguish
between a so-called ISM profile, n(r) = const., and a free stellar wind, $n(r)
\propto r^{-2}$. Our goal is to derive the most probable circumburst density
profile for a large number of Swift-detected bursts using well-sampled
afterglow light curves in the optical and X-ray bands. We combined all publicly
available optical and Swift/X-ray afterglow data from June 2005 to September
2009 to find the best-sampled late-time afterglow light curves. After applying
several selection criteria, our final sample consists of 27 bursts, including
one short burst. The afterglow evolution was then studied within the framework
of the fireball model. We find that the majority (18) of the 27 afterglow light
curves are compatible with a constant density medium (ISM case). Only 6 of the
27 afterglows show evidence for a wind profile at late times. In particular, we
set upper limits on the wind termination-shock radius, $R_T$, for GRB fireballs
which are propagating into an ISM profile and lower limits on $R_T$ for those
which were found to propagate through a wind medium. Observational evidence for
ISM profiles dominates in GRB afterglow studies, implying that most GRB
progenitors might have relatively small wind termination-shock radii. A smaller
group of progenitors, however, seems to be characterised by notably more
extended wind regions.

functionality, rapidly evolving components, and shrinking schedules. Abilities
to quickly adapt to changes, develop products with safe design, minimize
project costs, and deliver timely are needed. Model-based development (MBD)
follows a separation of concerns by abstracting systems with an appropriate
intensity. MBD promises higher comprehension by modeling on several
abstraction-levels, formal verification, and automated code generation. This
thesis demonstrates MBD with the Scicos/SynDEx framework on a distributed
embedded system. Scicos is a modeling and simulation environment for hybrid
systems. SynDEx is a rapid prototyping integrated development environment for
distributed systems. Performed examples implement well-known control algorithms
on a target system containing several networked microcontrollers, sensors, and
actuators. The addressed research question tackles the feasibility of MBD for
medium-sized embedded systems. In the case of single-processor applications
experiments show that the comforts of tool-provided simulation, verification,
and code-generation have to be weighed against an additional memory consumption
in dynamic and static memory compared to a hand-written approach. Establishing
a near-seamless modeling-framework with Scicos/SynDEx is expensive. An
increased development effort indicates a high price for developing single
applications, but might pay off for product families. A further drawback was
that the distributed code generated with SynDEx could not be adapted to
microcontrollers without a significant alteration of the scheduling tables. The
Scicos/SynDEx framework forms a valuable tool set that, however, still needs
many improvements. Therefore, its usage is only recommended for experimental
purposes.

by the Riemannian metric. Conversely, the heat kernel constructed from its
eigenvalues and eigenfunctions determines the Riemannian metric. This work
proves the analogy on Euclidean polyhedral surfaces (triangle meshes), that the
discrete Laplace-Beltrami operator and the discrete Riemannian metric (unique
up to a scaling) are mutually determined by each other. Given an Euclidean
polyhedral surface, its Riemannian metric is represented as edge lengths,
satisfying triangle inequalities on all faces. The Laplace-Beltrami operator is
formulated using the cotangent formula, where the edge weight is defined as the
sum of the cotangent of angles against the edge. We prove that the edge lengths
can be determined by the edge weights unique up to a scaling using the
variational approach. First, we show that the space of all possible metrics of
a polyhedral surface is convex. Then, we construct a special energy defined on
the metric space, such that the gradient of the energy equals to the edge
weights. Third, we show the Hessian matrix of the energy is positive definite,
restricted on the tangent space of the metric space, therefore the energy is
convex. Finally, by the fact that the parameter on a convex domain and the
gradient of a convex function defined on the domain have one-to-one
correspondence, we show the edge weights determines the polyhedral metric
unique up to a scaling. The constructive proof leads to a computational
algorithm that finds the unique metric on a topological triangle mesh from a
discrete Laplace-Beltrami operator matrix.

Lagrangian submanifold of X. Multiplying the homogeneous coordinates of X by
various fifth roots of unity gives automorphisms of X; the images of L under
these automorphisms defines a family of 625 different Lagrangian submanifolds,
called real Lagrangians. In this paper we try to calculate the Floer cohomology
between all pairs of these Lagrangians. We are able to complete most of the
calculations, but there are a few cases we cannot do.
  The basic idea is to explicitly describe some low energy moduli spaces and
then use this knowledge to calculate the differential on the E_2 page of the
standard spectral sequence for Floer cohomology. It turns out that this is
often enough to calculate the cohomology completely. Several techniques are
developed to help describe these low energy moduli spaces, including a formula
for the Maslov index, a formula for the obstruction bundle, and a way to relate
holomorphic strips and discs to holomorphic spheres. The real nature of the
Lagrangians is crucial for the development of these techniques.

horizon of these two black holes correspond respectively to the two turning

ergosphere coincides with the tunnelling barrier. Our calculation also implies
that the Hawking radiation comes from the apparent horizon.

structure of networks, respectively being based on the adjacency matrix, the

matrix, the correlation matrix and several other variants of these matrices.
However, the comparison between these spectral methods is less reported. More
importantly, it is still unclear which matrix is more appropriate for the
detection of community structure. This paper answers the question through
evaluating the effectiveness of these five matrices against the benchmark
networks with heterogeneous distributions of node degree and community size.
Test results demonstrate that the normalized Laplacian matrix and the
correlation matrix significantly outperform the other three matrices at
identifying the community structure of networks. This indicates that it is
crucial to take into account the heterogeneous distribution of node degree when
using spectral analysis for the detection of community structure. In addition,
to our surprise, the modularity matrix exhibits very similar performance to the
adjacency matrix, which indicates that the modularity matrix does not gain
desired benefits from using the configuration model as reference network with
the consideration of the node degree heterogeneity.

input is an undirected graph $G=(V,E),$ a balance parameter $b \in (0,1/2]$ and
a target conductance value $\gamma \in (0,1).$ The output is a cut which, if
non-empty, is of conductance at most $O(f),$ for some function $f(G, \gamma),$
and which is either balanced or well correlated with all cuts of conductance at
most $\gamma.$ Spielman and Teng gave an $\tilde{O}(|E|/\gamma^{2})$-time
algorithm for $f= \sqrt{\gamma \log^{3}|V|}$ and used it to decompose graphs
into a collection of near-expanders. We present a new spectral algorithm for
this problem which runs in time $\tilde{O}(|E|/\gamma)$ for $f=\sqrt{\gamma}.$
Our result yields the first nearly-linear time algorithm for the classic
Balanced Separator problem that achieves the asymptotically optimal
approximation guarantee for spectral methods. Our method has the advantage of
being conceptually simple and relies on a primal-dual semidefinite-programming
SDP approach. We first consider a natural SDP relaxation for the Balanced
Separator problem. While it is easy to obtain from this SDP a certificate of
the fact that the graph has no balanced cut of conductance less than $\gamma,$
somewhat surprisingly, we can obtain a certificate for the stronger correlation
condition. This is achieved via a novel separation oracle for our SDP and by
appealing to Arora and Kale's framework to bound the running time. Our result
contains technical ingredients that may be of independent interest.

scale power. We investigate associated systematic biases. We show that removing
line-of-sight fluctuations on large scales aliases into suppression of the 3D
power spectrum across a broad range of scales. This bias can be eliminated by
marginalizing over small k in the 1D power spectrum; however, the unbiased
estimator will have unavoidably larger variance. We also show that Gaussian
realizations of the power spectrum permit accurate and extremely rapid
Monte-Carlo simulations for error analysis; repeated realizations of the fully
non-Gaussian field are unnecessary. We perform Monte-Carlo maximum-likelihood
simulations of foreground removal which yield unbiased, minimum variance
estimates of the power spectrum in agreement with Fisher matrix estimates.
Foreground removal also distorts the 21cm PDF, reducing the contrast between
neutral and ionized regions. We show that it is the subtraction of large-scales
modes which is responsible for this distortion, and that it is less severe in
the earlier stages of reionization. It can be reduced by using larger
bandwidths for foreground removal. In the late stages of reionization, the
largest ionized regions (which consist of foreground emission only) provides
calibration points which potentially allow recovery of large-scale modes.
Finally, we also show that: (i) the broad frequency response of synchrotron and
free-free emission will smear out any features in the electron momentum
distribution and ensure spectrally smooth foregrounds; (ii) extragalactic radio
recombination lines should be negligible foregrounds.

Essentially Non-Oscillatory (5th-WENO) finite difference scheme is employed to
calculate the convection term of the lattice Boltzmann equation. The validity
of the model is verified by comparing simulation results of the Sod shock tube

effects on the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) are investigated using the

found that, the linear growth rate $\gamma$ for the KHI decreases with
increasing the width of velocity transition layer ${D_{v}}$ but increases with
increasing the width of density transition layer ${D_{\rho}}$. After the
initial transient period and before the vortex has been well formed, the linear
growth rates, $\gamma_v$ and $\gamma_{\rho}$, vary with ${D_{v}}$ and
${D_{\rho}}$ approximately in the following way, $\ln\gamma_{v}=a-bD_{v}$ and
$\gamma_{\rho}=c+e\ln D_{\rho} ({D_{\rho}}<{D_{\rho}^{E}})$, where $a$, $b$,
$c$ and $e$ are fitting parameters and ${D_{\rho}^{E}}$ is the effective
interaction width of density transition layer. When ${D_{\rho}}>{D_{\rho}^{E}}$
the linear growth rate $\gamma_{\rho}$ does not vary significantly any more.
One can use the hybrid effects of velocity and density transition layers to
stabilize the KHI. Our numerical simulation results are in general agreement

an important role in neural information processing. However, due to the
computational complexity of the task, only approximate solutions provide the
required efficiency (in terms of time). As new results show, under particular
conditions there exist efficient solutions by minimizing the magnitude of the

of features (`$l_0$-norm'). Straightforward neural implementation of these
solutions is not likely, as they require \emph{a priori} knowledge of the

re-evaluation of the reconstruction error, which in turn implies that final
sparse forms (featuring `population sparseness') can only be reached through
the formation of a series of non-sparse representations, which is in contrast

sparseness'). In this article we present a novel algorithm which integrates our
previous `$l_0$-norm' model on spike based probabilistic optimization for
sparse coding with ideas coming from novel `$l_1$-norm' solutions.

Muller matrix, corresponding to a retarder with arbritary variations of the
retardance and fast-axis orientation across the aperture. The resulting model
is verified by measuring the telescope polarization for unpolarized input light
and comparing to predictions from the polarization model. The accuracy of the
prediction is within approximately 0.4% for all normalized polarization
components (Q/I, U/I and V/I).
  The polarimeter used is based on two nematic liquid crystals and one linear
polarizer, and will be used for both imaging polarimetry and
spectropolarimetry. The most critical calibration is measuring the modulation
matrix. This is done by inserting one linear polarizer and one rotating
quarter-wave plate in the optical path before the polarimeter, and measuring
the modulated intensity. The calibration of the quarter-wave plate is optimized
by measuring the linear polarizer only with the polarimeter, and then
minimizing the error in degree of polarization plus the residual error for the
inversion of the modulation matrix by iteration of the two unknown parameters
(retardance and angle offset). We find that small non-linearities in the CCD
response is the major obstacle in calibrating the polarimeter. The first full

Dy$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ by studying its magnetization as a function of the rate at
which an external field is swept. At temperatures below the enigmatic
""freezing"" temperature $T_{\rm equil}\approx600$ mK, we find that even the
slowest sweeps fail to yield the equilibrium magnetization curve and instead
give a smooth, initially much flatter curve. For higher sweep rates, the
magnetization develops sharp steps accompanied by similarly sharp peaks in the
temperature of the sample. We ascribe the former behavior to the energy
barriers encountered in the magnetization process, which proceeds via flipping
of spins on filaments traced out by the field-driven motion of the gapped,
long-range interacting magnetic monopole excitations. In contrast, the peaks in
temperature result from the released Zeeman energy not being carried away
efficiently into the bath, with the resulting heating triggering a chain
reaction.

are involved in maintenance of eye position. The biophysical properties of
these neurons are essential for the operation of the vestibular neural
integrator that converts a head velocity signal to one that controls eye
position. A novel method named QSA (quadratic sinusoidal analysis) for voltage
clamped neurons was used to quantify nonlinear responses that are dominated by
dendrites. The voltage clamp currents were measured at harmonic and interactive
frequencies using specific stimulation frequencies, which act as frequency
probes of the intrinsic nonlinear neuronal behavior. These responses to paired
frequencies form a matrix that can be reduced by eigendecomposition to provide
a very compact piecewise quadratic analysis at different membrane potentials
that otherwise is usually described by complex differential equations involving
a large numbers of parameters and dendritic compartments. Moreover, the QSA
matrix can be interpolated to capture most of the nonlinear neuronal behavior
like a Volterra kernel. The interpolated quadratic functions of the two major
prepositus hypoglossi neurons, namely type B and D, are strikingly different. A
major part of the nonlinear responses is due to the persistent sodium
conductance, which appears to be essential for sustained nonlinear effects
induced by NMDA activation and thus would be critical for the operation of the
neural integrator. Finally, the dominance of the nonlinear responses by the
dendrites supports the hypothesis that persistent sodium conductance channels
and NMDA receptors act synergistically to dynamically control the influence of
individual synaptic inputs on network behavior.

in nonlinear ordinary differential equation (ODE) models where analytic
closed-form solutions are not available. The numerical solution-based nonlinear
least squares (NLS) estimator is investigated in this study. A numerical
algorithm such as the Runge--Kutta method is used to approximate the ODE
solution. The asymptotic properties are established for the proposed estimators
considering both numerical error and measurement error. The B-spline is used to
approximate the time-varying coefficients, and the corresponding asymptotic
theories in this case are investigated under the framework of the sieve
approach. Our results show that if the maximum step size of the $p$-order
numerical algorithm goes to zero at a rate faster than $n^{-1/(p\wedge4)}$, the
numerical error is negligible compared to the measurement error. This result
provides a theoretical guidance in selection of the step size for numerical
evaluations of ODEs. Moreover, we have shown that the numerical solution-based
NLS estimator and the sieve NLS estimator are strongly consistent. The sieve
estimator of constant parameters is asymptotically normal with the same
asymptotic co-variance as that of the case where the true ODE solution is
exactly known, while the estimator of the time-varying parameter has the
optimal convergence rate under some regularity conditions. The theoretical
results are also developed for the case when the step size of the ODE numerical
solver does not go to zero fast enough or the numerical error is comparable to
the measurement error. We illustrate our approach with both simulation studies

upon hydrogenation to graphane within the framework of density functional
theory. By analyzing the electronic structure for eighteen different hydrogen
concentrations, we bring out some novel features of this transition. Our
results show that the hydrogenation favors clustered configurations leading to
the formation of compact islands. The analysis of the charge density and
electron localization function (ELF) indicates that as hydrogen coverage
increases the semi-metal turns into a metal showing a delocalized charge
density, then transforms into an insulator. The metallic phase is spatially
inhomogeneous in the sense, it contains the islands of insulating regions
formed by hydrogenated carbon atoms and the metallic channels formed by
contiguous bare carbon atoms. It turns out that it is possible to pattern the
graphene sheet to tune the electronic structure. For example removal of
hydrogen atoms along the diagonal of the unit cell yielding an armchair pattern
at the edge gives rise to a band gap of 1.4 eV. We also show that a weak
ferromagnetic state exists even for a large hydrogen coverage whenever there is
a sub-lattice imbalance in presence of odd number of hydrogen atoms.

charmonium are determined at finite temperature from Hilbert moment QCD sum
rules. These parameters are the hadron mass, leptonic decay constant, total
width, and continuum threshold ($s_0$). Results for $s_0(T)$ in both channels
indicate that $s_0(T)$ starts approximately constant, and then it decreases
monotonically with increasing $T$ until it reaches the QCD threshold, $s_{th} =
4 m_Q^2$, at a critical temperature $T = T_c \simeq 180 \; \mbox{MeV}$
interpreted as the deconfinement temperature. The other hadronic parameters
behave qualitatively similarly to those of the $J/\psi$, as determined in this
same framework. The hadron mass is essentially constant, the total width is
initially independent of T, and after $T/T_c \simeq 0.80$ it begins to increase
with increasing $T$ up to $T/T_c \simeq 0.90 \; (0.95)$ for $\chi_c$
($\eta_c$), and subsequently it decreases sharply up to $T \simeq 0.94 \;
(0.99) \; T_c$, for $\chi_c$ ($\eta_c$), beyond which the sum rules are no
longer valid. The decay constant of $\chi_c$ at first remains basically flat up
to $T \simeq 0.80\; T_c$, then it starts to decrease up to $T \simeq 0.90
\;T_c$, and finally it increases sharply with increasing $T$. In the case of
$\eta_c$ the decay constant does not change up to $T \simeq 0.80 \;T_c$ where
it begins a gentle increase up to $T \simeq 0.95 \;T_c$ beyond which it
increases dramatically with increasing $T$. This behaviour contrasts with that
of light-light and heavy-light quark systems, and it suggests the survival of
the $\eta_c$ and the $\chi_c$ states beyond the critical temperature, as
already found for the $J/\psi$ from similar QCD sum rules. These conclusions
are very stable against changes in the critical temperature in the wide range
$T_c = 180 - 260 \; \mbox{MeV}$.

The study of its evolution has therefore important implications for models of

of early-type galaxies through the study of parameter correlations using a
sample of 135 field galaxies extracted from the Extended Groth Strip in the
redshift range 0.2<z<1.2. Using DEEP2 data, we calculate the internal velocity
dispersions by extracting the stellar kinematics from absorption line spectra,
using a maximum penalized likelihood approach. Morphology was determined
through visual classification using the V+I images of ACS. The structural
parameters of these galaxies were obtained by fitting de Vaucouleurs stellar
profiles to the ACS I-band images, using the GALFIT code. S\'ersic and
bulge-to-disc decomposition models were also fitted to our sample of galaxies,
and we found a good agreement in the Fundamental Plane derived from the three
models. Assuming that effective radii and velocity dispersions do not evolve
with redshift, we have found a brightening of 0.68 mag in the B-band and 0.52
mag in the g-band at <z>=0.7. However, the scatter in the FP is reduced by half
when we allow the FP slope to evolve, suggesting a different evolution of
early-type galaxies according to their intrinsic properties. The study of the
Kormendy relation shows the existence of a population of very compact (Re<2
Kpc) and bright galaxies (-21.5>Mg>-22.5), of which there are only a small
fraction (0.4%) at z=0. The evolution of these compact objects is mainly caused
by an increase in size that could be explained by the action of dry minor
mergers, and this population is responsible for the evolution detected in the
Fundamental Plane.

region of the asymptotic giant branch. They exhibit a pronounced variability of
their luminosity with a more or less well defined period and suffer large mass
loss in the form of stellar winds. Due to this extensive mass loss, LPVs and
Miras are surrounded by extended circumstellar dust shells (CDSs). The dynamics
of these envelopes is the result of a complex interplay via an external
excitation by the pulsating central star, dust formation and radiative
transfer. Our study is aimed at an understanding of the dynamics of CDSs around
carbon-rich, standard luminous LPVs and Miras. These shells often show
multiperiodicity with secondary periods as high as a few 10^4 d superimposed on
a main period which is in the range of approximately 10^2-10^3 d. Such
secondary periods may be caused at least in part by the presence of dust. We
consider an excitation of the CDSs by either a harmonic force, provided by the
oscillation of the central star, or by a stochastic force with a continuous
power spectrum. The resulting numerically computed dynamical behaviour of the
shell is analysed with the help of Fourier analysis and stroboscopic maps. CDSs
may be described as multioscillatory systems which are driven by the pulsating
stars. A set of normal modes can be identified. The obtained periods of these
modes are of the order of some 10^3 d, which is a characteristic timescale for
dust nucleation, growth and elemental enrichment in the dust formation zone.
Depending on the oscillation period and strength of the central star, the
envelope reacts periodically, multi- periodically or irregularly.

fundamental characteristic of this source's variability properties. However,
the variability itself is neither strictly stable nor changing on an even
longer characteristic timescale. We also demonstrate that the optical
counterpart varies on the same timescale, and is correlated with the soft, and
not the hard, X-rays. This clearly shows that X-ray reprocessing in LMXB discs
is mainly driven by soft X-rays. The X-ray spectra in different epochs of the
variability revealed a change of spectral characteristics which resemble the
state change of black hole X-ray binaries. All the evidence suggests that
4U1636-536 is frequently (~monthly) undergoing X-ray state transitions, a
characteristic feature of X-ray novae with their wide range of luminosities
associated with outburst events. In its current behavioural mode, this makes
4U1636-536 an ideal target for investigating the details of state changes in
luminous X-ray binaries.

introduce its numerical shadow, which is a probability measure on the complex
plane supported by the numerical range of $M$. The shadow of $M$ at point $z$
is defined as the probability that the inner product $(Mu,u)$ is equal to $z$,
where $u$ stands for a random complex vector from $H_N$, satisfying $||u||=1$.
In the case of N=2 the numerical shadow of a non-normal operator can be
interpreted as a shadow of a hollow sphere projected on a plane. A similar
interpretation is provided also for higher dimensions. For a hermitian $M$ its
numerical shadow forms a probability distribution on the real axis which is
shown to be a one dimensional $B$-spline. In the case of a normal $M$ the
numerical shadow corresponds to a shadow of a transparent solid simplex in
$R^{N-1}$ onto the complex plane. Numerical shadow is found explicitly for
Jordan matrices $J_N$, direct sums of matrices and in all cases where the
shadow is rotation invariant. Results concerning the moments of shadow measures
play an important role. A general technique to study numerical shadow via the

is used to determine the astrometric positions of the maser emission, and
multi-epoch observations can reveal 3D motions. The 6.7 GHz methanol masers are
found in a filamentary structure over ~1350 AU, straddling the waist of the
radio jet HW2. The positions agree well with previous observations of both the
6.7 and 12.2 GHz methanol masers. The velocity field of the maser spots does
not show any sign of rotation, but is instead consistent with an infall

and it acquires mass $m_{\phi_{0}}\sim \mu_{r}$ with the $\mu$ term, which can
be lighter than half the SM-like Higgs boson mass in a portion of parameter
space. Thus, the SM-like Higgs boson $h$ can dominantly decay into a pair of
light neutral Higgs bosons especially when $m_{h}$ is below the $WW$ threshold.
First, we examine the branching ratios of the SM-like Higgs boson decays and
find that the new decay mode $h\rightarrow \phi_{0}\phi_{0}$ is dominant for
the case of $m_{h}>2m_{\phi_{0}}$. Then we study the production via gluon
fusion followed by the decay into two photons or two weak gauge bosons and
found that the production rate can be significantly suppressed for some part of
parameter space. Finally, we comparatively study the process
$\gamma\gamma\rightarrow h \rightarrow b\bar{b}$ at ILC in the cases of
$m_{h}>2m_{\phi_{0}}$ and $m_{h}<2m_{\phi_{0}}$, respectively. We find that
these predictions can significantly deviated from the SM predictions, e.g., the
gluon-gluon fusion channel, in the cases of $m_{h}>2m_{\phi_{0}}$ and
$m_{h}<2m_{\phi_{0}}$, can be suppressed by about 80% and 45%, respectively.

Although this former method performs well on 1D test cases, the interface
reconstruction suffers of poor accuracy in conserving shapes for instance in
linear advection. This situation leads to spurious instabilities of the
interface. The method Enhanced-NIP presented in the present paper cures an
inconsistency in the former NIP method that improves strikingly the results. It
takes advantage of a more consistent description of the interface in the
numerical scheme. Results for linear advection and compressible Euler equations
for inviscid fluids are presented to assess the benefits of this new method.

resolving gas dynamics on GMC scales. SPH calculations first investigated the
response of isothermal gas to a spiral potential, in the absence of self
gravity and magnetic fields. Surprisingly though, even these simple
calculations displayed substructure along the spiral arms. Numerical tests
indicate that this substructure is still present at high resolution (100
million particles, ~10 pc), and is independent of the initial particle
distribution. One interpretation of the formation of substructure is that
smaller clouds can agglomerate into more massive GMCs via dissipative
collisions. More recent calculations have investigated how other processes,
such as the thermodynamics of the ISM, and self gravity affect this simple
picture. Further research has focused on developing models with a more
realistic spiral structure, either by including stars, or incorporating a tidal

growth/fragmentation in binary systems. In our model, a gas and dust disk is
present around the primary star and is perturbed by the secondary. We study the
effects of a secondary with/without eccentricity on the dust population to
determine what sizes the aggregates can reach and how that compares to the dust
population in disks around single stars.
  We find that the secondary star has two effects on the dust population. 1.)
The disk is truncated due to the presence of the secondary star and the maximum
mass of the particles is decreased in the lowered gas densities. This effect is
dominant in the outer disk. 2.) The perturbation of the secondary pumps up the
eccentricity of the gas disk, which in turn increases the relative velocity
between the dust and the gas. Therefore the maximum particle sizes are further
decreased. The second effect of the secondary influences the entire disk.
Coagulation is efficiently reduced even at the very inner parts of the disk.
The average mass of the particles is reduced by four orders of magnitude (as a
consequence, the stopping time is reduced by one order of magnitude) in disks
around binary systems compared to dust in disks around single stars.

Particular attention is given to those stresses that resist contraction. After
looking at the general case, we consider the two opposite limits of poor and
high electrical conductivity. In the former there are electric fields but no
currents, while in the latter the situation is reversed. When the conductivity
is low, we find that the main agents acting against the collapse are the

seems to come from the tension of the magnetic forcelines. In either case, we
discuss whether and how the aforementioned resisting stresses may halt the

further to the static nature of classical logic. The new mathematical theory,
DL, is a process-logic. A salient property of this process is evolution of

PSS: situation learning from object perceptions. Then we relate DL to the
essential PSS mechanisms of concepts, simulators, grounding, productivity,

grounding, and possible role of language in grounding abstract cognition. The

minimal enclosing ball (MEB) problem as a prominent representative. We connect
the problem to results in classic convex geometry and introduce a new series of
radii, which we call core-radii. For the MEB problem, these radii have already
been considered from a different point of view and sharp inequalities between
them are known. In this paper sharp inequalities between core-radii for general
containment under homothetics are obtained. Moreover, the presented
inequalities are used to derive sharp upper bounds on the size of core-sets for
containment under homothetics. In the MEB case, this yields a tight (dimension
independent) bound for the size of such core-sets. In the general case, we show
that there are core-sets of size linear in the dimension and that this bound
stays sharp even if the container is required to be symmetric.

2.13E35 erg/s) and PSR J2240+5832 (P=140 ms, Edot = 2.12E35 erg/s) were
discovered in 1997 with the Nancay radio telescope during a northern Galactic
plane survey, using the Navy-Berkeley Pulsar Processor (NBPP) filter bank. GeV
gamma-ray pulsations from both were discovered using the Fermi Large Area
Telescope. Twelve years of radio and polarization data allow detailed
investigations. The two pulsars resemble each other both in radio and in
gamma-ray data. Both are rare in having a single gamma-ray pulse offset far
from the radio peak. The high dispersion measure for PSR J0248+6021 (DM = 370
pc cm^-3) is most likely due to its being within the dense, giant HII region W5
in the Perseus arm at a distance of 2 kpc, not beyond the edge of the Galaxy as
obtained from models of average electron distributions. Its high transverse
velocity and the low magnetic field along the line-of-sight favor this small
distance. Neither gamma-ray, X-ray, nor optical data yield evidence for a
pulsar wind nebula surrounding PSR J0248+6021. The gamma-ray luminosity for PSR
J0248+6021 is L_ gamma = (1.4 \pm 0.3)\times 10^34 erg/s. For PSR J2240+5832,
we find either L_gamma = (7.9 \pm 5.2) \times 10^34 erg/s if the pulsar is in
the Outer arm, or L_gamma = (2.2 \pm 1.7) \times 10^34 erg/s for the Perseus
arm. These luminosities are consistent with an L_gamma ~ sqrt(Edot) rule.
Comparison of the gamma-ray pulse profiles with model predictions, including
the constraints obtained from radio polarization data, favor emission in the
far magnetosphere. These two pulsars differ mainly in their inclination angles
and acceleration gap widths, which in turn explains the observed differences in
the gamma-ray peak widths.

molecules by inhomogeneous static electric field. Rainbow-like features in the
angular distribution of the scattered molecules are analyzed in detail.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that one may efficiently control the deflection
process with the help of short and strong femtosecond laser pulses. In
particular the deflection process may by turned-off by a proper excitation, and
the angular dispersion of the deflected molecules can be substantially reduced.
We study the problem both classically and quantum mechanically, taking into
account the effects of strong deflecting field on the molecular rotations. In
both treatments we arrive at the same conclusions. The suggested control scheme
paves the way for many applications involving molecular focusing, guiding, and
trapping by inhomogeneous fields.

a single site $n_0$ in translationally invariant harmonic and anharmonic chains
with random interactions. In the harmonic case, the energy profile $ \bar{<
e_n(t)>}$ averaged on time and disorder decays for large $|n-n_0|$ as a power
law $\bar{< e_n(t)>}\approx C|n-n_0|^{-\eta}$ where $\eta=5/2$ and 3/2 for
initial displacement and momentum excitations, respectively. The prefactor $C$
depends on the probability distribution of the harmonic coupling constants and
diverges in the limit of weak disorder. As a consequence, the moments $<
m_{\nu}(t)>$ of the energy distribution averaged with respect to disorder
diverge in time as $t^{\beta(\nu)}$ for $\nu \geq 2$, where $\beta=\nu+1-\eta$
for $\nu>\eta-1$. Molecular dynamics simulations yield good agreement with
these theoretical predictions. Therefore, in this system, the second moment of
the wavepacket diverges as a function of time despite the wavepacket is not
spreading. Thus, this only criteria often considered earlier as proving the
spreading of a wave packet, cannot be considered as sufficient in any model.
The anharmonic case is investigated numerically. It is found for intermediate
disorder, that the tail of the energy profile becomes very close to those of
the harmonic case. For weak and strong disorder, our results suggest that the
crossover to the harmonic behavior occurs at much larger $|n-n_0|$ and larger
time.

the observational evidence of triggered star formation in the surroundings of
HII regions, we analyze the ISM around the HII region G35.673-00.847, a poorly
studied source. Using data from large-scale surveys: Two Micron All Sky Survey,
Galactic Legacy Infrared Mid-Plane Survey Extraordinaire (GLIMPSE), MIPSGAL,
Galactic Ring Survey (GRS), VLA Galactic Plane Survey (VGPS), and NRAO VLA Sky
Survey (NVSS) we performed a multiwavelength study of G35.673-00.847 and its
surroundings. The mid IR emission, shows that G35.673-00.847 has an almost
semi-ring like shape with a cut towards the galactic west. The radius of this
semi-ring is about 1.5' (~1.6 pc, at the distance of ~3.7 kpc). The distance
was estimated from an HI absorption study and from the analysis of the
molecular gas. Indeed, we find a molecular shell composed by several clumps
distributed around the HII region, suggesting that its expansion is collecting
the surrounding material. We find several YSO candidates over the molecular
shell. Finally, comparing the HII region dynamical age and the fragmentation
time of the molecular shell, we discard the collect and collapse as the
mechanism responsible for the YSOs formation, suggesting other processes such
as radiative driven implosion and/or small-scale Jeans gravitational
instabilities.
