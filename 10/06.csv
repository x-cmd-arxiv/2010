enhances quasiparticle scattering by the pair potential.

Background independence is maintained in this approach by adopting DeWitt's

mechanics. This enables us to construct certain background independent notion
of Virasoro generators, called DeWitt-Virasoro (DWV) generators, and invariant
matrix elements of an arbitrary operator constructed out of them in spin-zero
representation. We show that the DWV algebra is given by the Witt algebra with
additional anomalous terms that vanish for Ricci-flat backgrounds. The actual
quantum Virasoro generators should be obtained by first introducing the vacuum

demonstrate the procedure in the simple cases of flat and pp-wave backgrounds.

reactions which synthesize biomass molecules from chemicals in an organism's

metabolic genotype, defined by a set of enzyme-coding genes whose products
catalyze the network's reactions. Each metabolic genotype has a metabolic
phenotype, such as the ability to synthesize biomass on a spectrum of different
sources of chemical elements and energy. We here focus on sulfur metabolism,
which is attractive to study the evolution of metabolic networks, because it
involves many fewer reactions than carbon metabolism. Specifically, we study
properties of the space of all possible metabolic genotypes, and analyze
properties of random metabolic genotypes that are viable on different numbers
of sulfur sources. We show that metabolic genotypes with the same phenotype
form large connected genotype networks that extend far through metabolic
genotype space. How far they reach through this space is a linear function of
the number of super-essential reactions in such networks, the number of
reactions that occur in all networks with the same phenotype. We show that
different neighborhoods of any genotype network harbor very different novel
phenotypes, metabolic innovations that can sustain life on novel sulfur
sources. We also analyze the ability of evolving populations of metabolic
networks to explore novel metabolic phenotypes. This ability is facilitated by
the existence of genotype networks, because different neighborhoods of these
networks contain very different novel phenotypes. In contrast to
macromolecules, where phenotypic robustness may facilitate phenotypic
innovation, we show that here the ability to access novel phenotypes does not
monotonically increase with robustness.

In this paper, we discuss an analogue of such a magnetoelectric effect in the
thermal (or gravitational) and the magnetic dipole responses in all symmetry
classes which admit topologically non-trivial insulators or superconductors to
exist in three dimensions. In particular, for topological superconductors (or
superfluids) with time-reversal symmetry which lack SU(2) spin rotation
symmetry (e.g. due to spin-orbit interactions), such as the B phase of $^3$He,
the thermal response is the only probe which can detect the non-trivial
topological character through transport. We show that, for such topological
superconductors, applying a temperature gradient produces a thermal- (or mass-)
surface current perpendicular to the thermal gradient. Such charge, thermal, or
magnetic dipole responses provide a definition of topological insulators and
superconductors beyond the single-particle picture. Moreover we find, for a
significant part of the 'ten-fold' list of topological insulators found in
previous work in the absence of interactions, that in general dimensions the
effective field theory describing the space-time responses is governed by a
field theory anomaly. Since anomalies are known to be insensitive to whether
the underlying fermions are interacting or not, this shows that the
classification of these topological insulators is robust to adiabatic
deformations by interparticle interactions in general dimensionality. In
particular, this applies to symmetry classes DIII, CI, and AIII in three

this channel, we show that $\frac{K}{2}$ degrees of freedom is achievable if

involves a \textit{signal space alignment for an encryption message} for the

for the interaction was performed to identify all parameter combinations that
allow for modeling the Magellanic Stream. Satisfactory models exist for the
dynamical mass of the Milky Way within a wide range of 0.6*10^12Msun to
3.0*10^12Msun and over the entire 1-sigma errors of the proper motions of the
Clouds. However, the successful models share a common interaction scenario. The
Magellanic Clouds are satellites of the Milky Way, and in all cases two close
LMC-SMC encounters occurred within the last 4Gyr at t<-2.5Gyr and t approx.
-150Myr, triggering the formation of the Stream and of the Magellanic Bridge,

unequal mass hosting a strong central starburst and a weak AGN. We detect HI
emission from both tidal tails and from nearby galaxies, suggesting that NGC 34

one of its companions. The kinematics of the gas suggests this remnant is
forming an outer disk of neutral hydrogen from the gas of the northern tail. We

with jets and missing transverse energy. At least one of these photons has the
origin in displaced vertex, thus delayed and non-pointing. We consider a
supersymmetric scenario in which the gravitino is the lightest supersymmetric
particle (LSP) (with a mass $\sim 1~{keV}$) and the lightest neutralino is the
next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle (NLSP). The NLSP decays dominantly
into a photon and a gravitino within the detector with a decay length ranging
from $c\tau_{\tilde{\chi}}\sim$ 50-100 cm. In addition, we assume that the
second lightest neutralino and the lightest neutralino are nearly degenerate
and this leads to a prompt radiative decay of the next-to-lightest neutralino
into a photon and a lightest neutralino with a large branching ratio. Such
degenerate neutralinos can be realised in various representations of the
$SU(5)$, $SO(10)$, and $E(6)$ Grand Unified Theories (GUTs). The non-pointing
photons can be reconstructed at the electromagnetic calorimeter of the ATLAS
inner-detector, which have been designed with good timing and directional
resolution. We find that with a centre-of-mass energy $E_{cm}=14 ~{TeV}$ at an
integrated luminosity of 100 $fb^{-1}$ one may see evidence of hundreds of
tri-photon events and a few four-photons events at the LHC, in addition to
several thousands di-photon events. We also predict the event rates even at the

vacancy diffusion but treats vacancies as conserved. It gives three sets of
propagating elastic modes; it also gives two diffusive modes, one largely of
entropy density and one largely of vacancy density (or, more generally, defect
density). For the vacancy diffusion mode (or, equivalently, the lattice
diffusion mode) the vacancies behave like a fluid within the solid, with the
deviations of internal pressure associated with density changes nearly
canceling the deviations of stress associated with strain. We briefly consider
pressurization experiments in solid $^4$He at low temperatures in light of this

aggregation has emerged as a basic approach in WSNs in order to reduce the

minimizing the overall power consumption in the network. If a sensor node fails
during data aggregation then the aggregation tree is disconnected. Hence the
WSNs rely on in-network aggregation for efficiency but a single faulty node can
severely influence the outcome by contributing an arbitrary partial aggregate

estimates. It is proved that, in comparison to the least squares estimate, one
alternative has a significantly smaller quadratic risk, retaining at the same
time unbiasedness and consistency. These properties hold true for
one-dimensional, multi-dimensional, orthogonal and non-orthogonal problems.
Moreover, a Monte-Carlo simulation confirms high robustness of the
quasi-estimator to violations of the initial assumptions. Therefore, at the
first stage of the estimation we calculate mentioned two alternative estimates.
At the second stage we choose the better estimate out of these alternatives. In
order to do so we use additional information, among it but not exclusively of a
priori nature. In case of two alternatives the volume of such information
should be minimal. Furthermore, the additional information is not built-in into
the quasi-estimator structure, so that any kind of information, even intuitive
one, can be used. These features, in combination with decrease of the quadratic
risk, provide a great advantage of our method. A variety of types of the
additional information for choosing the better estimate is considered. One
example is the successful processing of the famous experiment conducted by
astronomers in 1919 to verify the General The-ory of Relativity of A. Einstein.

$m_{0}$ is the rest mass of each particle and $a_{*}$ is the nondimensional

spin or $a_{*}\to 1$. On the other hand, even if we take Thorne's bound on the

contains a kinetic term for the fermionic fields with mass dimension one. We
then derive the corresponding on-shell supercurrent and succeed to formulate a

indicators of solar activity and the barycentric motion of the Sun. The latter
is exemplified by transitions between regular and more disordered motion
modulated by the motions of the giant planets, and rare periods of retrograde
motion with negative orbital angular momentum. An examination of the
barycentric motion of exoplanet host stars, and their stellar activity cycles,
has the potential of proving or disproving the Sun's motion as an underlying
factor in the complex patterns of short- and long-term solar variability
indices, by establishing whether such correlations exist in other planetary
systems. A variety of complex patterns of barycentric motions of exoplanet host
stars is demonstrated, depending on the number, masses and orbits of the
planets. Each of the behavioural types proposed to correlate with solar
activity are also evident in exoplanet host stars: repetitive patterns
influenced by massive multiple planets, epochs of rapid change in orbital
angular momentum, and intervals of negative orbital angular momentum. The study
provides the basis for independent investigations of the widely-studied but
unproven suggestion that the Sun's motion is somehow linked to various
indicators of solar activity. We show that, because of the nature of their
barycentric motions, the host stars HD168443 and HD74156 offer particularly

conditions, it is possible to define a stochastic integral of the process b(Y)

well know that the stochastic exponential of this stochastic integral is a

of Coulomb repulsion, the competition between extended s-wave superconducting
order (s+-) and the spin-density wave (SDW) order and the angular dependence of
the superconducting gap in multi-pocket models of Iron based superconductors.
Previous analytic RG studies considered a toy model of one hole and one
electron pocket. We consider more realistic models of two electron pockets and
either two or three hole pockets, and also incorporate the angular dependence
of interaction. We neglect for simplicity one of the two hole pockets centered
at k=0, which is less nested with electron pockets, i.e., consider 3-pocket and
4-pocket models. In a toy 2-pocket model, SDW order always wins over s+- order
at perfect nesting, and s+- order only appears at a finite doping, and only if
RG flow extends long enough to overcome intra-pocket Coulomb repulsion. For
multi-pocket models, we find two new effects. First, there always exists an
attractive component of the interaction in s+- channel, such that the system
necessary becomes a superconductor once it overcomes the competition from the
SDW state. Second, in 3-pocket case (but not in 4-pocket case), there are
situations when s+- order wins over SDW order even for perfect nesting,
suggesting that SDW order is not a necessary pre-condition for the s+- order.
Our results are in good agreement with recent numerical functional RG studies

due to its parabolic dispersion, interaction-induced symmetry breaking is
already expected at zero magnetic field. In this work, the underlying order of
the various broken-symmetry states is investigated in bilayer graphene that is
suspended between top and bottom gate electrodes. By controllably breaking the
spin and sublattice symmetries we are able to deduce the order parameter of the
various quantum Hall ferromagnetic states. At small carrier densities, we
identify for the first time three distinct broken symmetry states, one of which
is consistent with either spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry or
spontaneously broken rotational symmetry.

corrections by extending the model to N >>1 fermionic flavors, with 1/N playing
the role of a small Eliashberg parameter. We argue, however, that it is still
necessary to solve coupled integral equations for the frequency dependent
fermionic and bosonic self-energies, both in the normal and superconducting

pairing at Tc ~ 30 K, roughly three times larger than the one obtained
previously [P. Krotkov and A. Chubukov, Phys. Rev. B 74, 014509 (2006)], where
it was assumed that the equations for fermionic and bosonic self-energies
decouple in the normal state. To obtain the momentum and frequency dependent
d-wave superconducting gap D(k,w), we derive and solve the non-linear gap
equation together with the modified equation for the bosonic self energy which
below Tc depends on the pairing gap. We find that the gap is a non-monotonic
function of momentum along the Fermi surface, with its node along the zone
diagonal and its maximum some distance away from it. We obtain 2D/Tc ~ 4. We

described by their masses and spins. An observational test of the no-hair
theorem can be performed by measuring at least three different multipole
moments of the spacetime of a black hole and verifying whether their values are
consistent with the unique combinations of the Kerr solution. In this paper, we
study quasi-periodic variability observed in the emission from black holes
across the electromagnetic spectrum as a test of the no-hair theorem. We derive
expressions for the Keplerian and epicyclic frequencies in a quasi-Kerr
spacetime, in which the quadrupole moment is a free parameter in addition to
mass and spin. We show that, for moderate spins, the Keplerian frequency is
practically independent of small deviations of the quadrupole moment from the
Kerr value, while the epicyclic frequencies exhibit significant variations. We
apply this framework to quasi-periodic oscillations in black-hole X-ray
binaries in two different scenarios. In the case that a pair of quasi-periodic
oscillations can be identified as the fundamental g- and c-modes in the
accretion disk, we show that the no-hair theorem can be tested in conjunction
with an independent mass measurement. If, on the other hand, the pairs of
oscillations are identified with non-parametric resonance of dynamical
frequencies in the accretion disk, then testing the no-hair theorem also
requires an independent measurement of the black-hole spin. In addition, we
argue that VLBI observations of Sgr A* may test the no-hair theorem through a
combination of imaging observations and the detection of quasi-periodic
variability.

afterglow that was yet sufficiently bright for high-quality absorption-line
spectroscopy. The host galaxy is clearly resolved in deep HST WF3/IR F160W
images and well detected in the Spitzer IRAC 3.5 micron and 4.5 micron
channels, while displaying little/no fluxes in deep optical images from Keck
and Magellan. The extremely red optical-infrared colors are consistent with the
large extinction seen in the afterglow light, suggesting that the large amount
of dust and gas surface mass density seen along the afterglow sightline is not
merely local but likely reflects the global dust content across the entire host
galaxy. Adopting the dust properties and metallicity of the host ISM derived
from studies of early-time afterglow light and absorption-line spectroscopy, we
perform a stellar population synthesis analysis of the observed spectral energy
distribution to constrain the intrinsic luminosity and stellar population of
this dark burst host. The host galaxy is best described by an exponentially
declining star formation rate of e-folding time tau=2 Gyr and an age of ~2 Gyr.
We also derive an extinction corrected star formation rate of SFR 125 h^{-2}
M_sun/yr and a total stellar mass of M_* ~ 4x10^11 h^{-2} M_sun. Our study
provides an example of massive, dusty star-forming galaxies contributing to the
GRB host galaxy population, supporting the notion that long-duration GRBs trace

February through the 7 month monitoring with the MAXI GSC. The maximum 2 -- 10
keV flux in the January and February flares was measured as 120 +- 10 mCrab and
164 +- 17 mCrab respectively; the latter is the highest among those reported
from the object. A comparison of the MAXI and Swift BAT data suggests a convex
X-ray spectrum with an approximated photon index of about 2. This spectrum is
consistent with a picture that MAXI is observing near the synchrotron peak
frequency. The source exhibited a spectral variation during these flares,
slightly different from those in the previous observations, in which the
positive correlation between the flux and hardness was widely reported. By
equating the halving decay timescale in the January flare, $t_{\rm d} \sim 2.5
\times 10^{4}$ s, to the synchrotron cooling time, the magnetic field was
evaluated as B = 0.045 G $(\delta/10)^{-1/3}$, where $\delta$ is the jet
beaming factor. Assuming that the light crossing time of the emission region is
shorter than the doubling rise time, $t_{\rm r} \lesssim 2 \times 10^{4}$ s,
the region size was roughly estimated as $ R < 6 \times 10^{15}$ cm
$(\delta/10)$. These are consistent with the values previously reported. For
the February flare, the rise time, $t_{\rm r} < 1.3 \times 10^{5}$ s, gives a
loose upper limit on the size as $ R < 4 \times 10^{16}$ cm $(\delta/10)$,
although the longer decay time $t_{\rm d} \sim 1.4 \times 10^{5}$ s, indicates
B = 0.015 G $(\delta/10)^{-1/3}$, which is weaker than the previous results.
This could be reconciled by invoking a scenario that this flare is a
superposition of unresolved events with a shorter timescale.

simulations of dwarf galaxies in a Lambda cold dark matter Universe, we show
how baryons attain a final angular momentum distribution which allows pure disc
galaxies to form. Blowing out substantial amounts of gas through supernovae and
stellar winds, which is well supported observationally, is a key ingredient in
forming bulgeless discs. We outline why galactic outflows preferentially remove
low angular momentum material, and show that this is a natural result when
structure forms in a cold dark matter cosmology. The driving factors are a) the
mean angular momentum of accreted material increases with time, b) lower
potentials at early times, c) the existence of an extended reservoir of high
angular momentum gas which is not within star forming regions, meaning that
only gas from the inner region (low angular momentum gas) is expelled and d)
the tendency for outflows to follow the path of least resistance which is
perpendicular to the disc. We also show that outflows are enhanced during
mergers, thus expelling much of the gas which has lost its angular momentum
during these events, and preventing the formation of ""classical"", merger driven
bulges in low mass systems. Stars formed prior to such mergers form a diffuse,
extended stellar halo component.

we consider a bilayer Hubbard model on a triangular lattice. Our results are
obtained in the framework of a cluster dynamical mean-field calculation with a
quantum Monte Carlo impurity solver. For appropriate model parameters, we
observe an enhancement of the effective mass as the first layer approaches
integer filling and the second remains only partially filled. At finite
temperatures, this increase of the effective mass -- or, equivalently, the
decrease of the coherence temperature -- leads to a crossover to a state where
the first layer fermions localize, drop out of the Luttinger volume, and
generate essentially free local moments. This finite temperature behavior is
shown to be robust against the cluster size above some critical temperature.
The zero temperature phase diagram, however, depends on the cluster topology.
In particular, for clusters with an even number of unit cells, the growth of
the effective mass is cut off by a first-order, orbital-selective Mott
transition.

density of 0.40 +- 0.10 g cm-3. HAT-P-26b is the fourth Neptune-mass transiting

Super-Neptunes, but a radius that is ~65% larger than those of Neptune and

the exact composition is uncertain as there are significant differences between
various theoretical models at the Neptune-mass regime. The equatorial

measurements conducted independently using both leading methods are in
agreement with one another. For the continuum-fitting analysis, we use a data
sample consisting of several dozen RXTE spectra, and for the Fe-K analysis, we
use a pair of ASCA spectra from a single epoch. Our spin estimate for the black
hole primary using the continuum-fitting method is -0.11 < a* < 0.71 (90 per

result, we have thoroughly explored the dependence of the spin value on a wide
range of model-dependent systematic errors and observational errors; our
precision is limited by uncertainties in the distance and orbital inclination
of the system. For the Fe-line method, our estimate of spin is a* =

terabytes of images and detect hundreds of millions of sources every night. The
study of these sources will involve computation challenges such as anomaly
detection and classification, and moving object tracking. Since such studies
benefit from the highest quality data, methods such as image coaddition
(stacking) will be a critical preprocessing step prior to scientific
investigation. With a requirement that these images be analyzed on a nightly
basis to identify moving sources or transient objects, these data streams
present many computational challenges. Given the quantity of data involved, the
computational load of these problems can only be addressed by distributing the
workload over a large number of nodes. However, the high data throughput
demanded by these applications may present scalability challenges for certain
storage architectures. One scalable data-processing method that has emerged in
recent years is MapReduce, and in this paper we focus on its popular
open-source implementation called Hadoop. In the Hadoop framework, the data is
partitioned among storage attached directly to worker nodes, and the processing
workload is scheduled in parallel on the nodes that contain the required input
data. A further motivation for using Hadoop is that it allows us to exploit
cloud computing resources, e.g., Amazon's EC2. We report on our experience
implementing a scalable image-processing pipeline for the SDSS imaging database
using Hadoop. This multi-terabyte imaging dataset provides a good testbed for
algorithm development since its scope and structure approximate future surveys.
First, we describe MapReduce and how we adapted image coaddition to the

approach and report experimental results comparing their performance.

analysis consists of 9 optically-confirmed high-mass clusters comprising the
high-significance end of the total cluster sample identified in 455 square
degrees of sky surveyed during 2008 at 148 GHz. We focus on the most massive
systems to reduce the degeneracy between unknown cluster astrophysics and
cosmology derived from SZ surveys. We describe the scaling relation between
cluster mass and SZ signal with a 4-parameter fit. Marginalizing over the
values of the parameters in this fit with conservative priors gives sigma_8 =
0.851 +/- 0.115 and w = -1.14 +/- 0.35 for a spatially-flat wCDM cosmological
model with WMAP 7-year priors on cosmological parameters. This gives a modest
improvement in statistical uncertainty over WMAP 7-year constraints alone.
Fixing the scaling relation between cluster mass and SZ signal to a fiducial
relation obtained from numerical simulations and calibrated by X-ray
observations, we find sigma_8 = 0.821 +/- 0.044 and w = -1.05 +/- 0.20. These
results are consistent with constraints from WMAP 7 plus baryon acoustic
oscillations plus type Ia supernoava which give sigma_8 = 0.802 +/- 0.038 and w
= -0.98 +/- 0.053. A stacking analysis of the clusters in this sample compared
to clusters simulated assuming the fiducial model also shows good agreement.
These results suggest that, given the sample of clusters used here, both the
astrophysics of massive clusters and the cosmological parameters derived from
them are broadly consistent with current models.

discovered by transit photometry, and these systems are important because the
transit strongly constrains their orbital inclination and allows accurate
physical parameters for the planet to be derived, especially their radii. Their
mass-radius relation allows us to probe their internal structure. In the
present work we calculate Safronov numbers for the current sample of ESP and
compare their masses and radii to current models with the goal of obtaining
better constrains on their formation processe. Our calculation of Safronov
numbers for the current TESP sample does show 2 classes, although about 20% lie
above the formal Class I definition. These trends and recent results that argue
against a useful distinction between Safronov classes are under further
investigation. Mass-radius relations for the current sample of TESP are
inconsistent with ESP models with very large core masses (\geq 100 M\oplus).
Most TESP with radii near 1RJ are consistent with models with no core mass or
core masses of 10 M\oplus . The inflated planets, with radii \geq 1.2 RJ are
not consistent with current ESP models, but may lie along the lower end of
models for brown dwarfs. Although such models are nascent, it is important to
establish trends for the current sample of ESP, which will further the

interference channel, where the $k$th user interferes with only the $(k-1)$th
user (mod $K$) in the network. Inspired by the work of Etkin, Tse and Wang, who
derived a capacity region outer bound for the two-user Gaussian interference
channel and proved that a simple Han-Kobayashi power splitting scheme can
achieve to within one bit of the capacity region for all values of channel
parameters, this paper shows that a similar strategy also achieves the capacity
region of the $K$-user cyclic interference channel to within a constant gap in
the weak interference regime. Specifically, for the $K$-user cyclic Gaussian
interference channel, a compact representation of the Han-Kobayashi achievable
rate region using Fourier-Motzkin elimination is first derived, a capacity
region outer bound is then established. It is shown that the Etkin-Tse-Wang
power splitting strategy gives a constant gap of at most 2 bits in the weak
interference regime. For the special 3-user case, this gap can be sharpened to
1 1/2 bits by time-sharing of several different strategies. The capacity result
of the $K$-user cyclic Gaussian interference channel in the strong interference
regime is also given. Further, based on the capacity results, this paper
studies the generalized degrees of freedom (GDoF) of the symmetric cyclic
interference channel. It is shown that the GDoF of the symmetric capacity is
the same as that of the classic two-user interference channel, no matter how
many users are in the network.

galactic coronae around intermediate-mass spheroid galaxies embedded in the
intracluster/intragroup medium (ICM). We conduct 2-D hydrodynamic simulations
to study the quasi-steady-state properties of such coronae as the natural
products of the ongoing distributed stellar feedback semi-confined by the
thermal and ram pressures of the ICM. We find that the temperature of a
simulated corona depends primarily on the specific energy of the feedback,
consistent with the lack of the correlation between the observed hot gas
temperature and K-band luminosity of galaxies. The simulated coronae typically
represent subsonic outflows, chiefly because of the semi-confinement. As a
result, the hot gas density increases with the ICM thermal pressure. The ram
pressure, on the other hand, chiefly affects the size and lopsidedness of the
coronae. The density increase could lead to the compression of cool gas clouds,
if present, and hence the formation of stars. The increase also enhances
radiative cooling of the hot gas, which may fuel central supermassive black
holes, explaining the higher frequency of active galactic nuclei observed in
clusters than in the field. The radiation enhancement is consistent with a
substantially higher surface brightness of the X-ray emission detected from
coronae in cluster environment. The total X-ray luminosity of a corona,
however, depends on the relative importance of the surrounding thermal and ram
pressures. These environment dependences should at least partly explain the
large dispersion in the observed diffuse X-ray luminosities of spheroids with
similar stellar properties. Furthermore, we show that an outflow powered by the
distributed feedback can naturally produce a positive radial gradient in the
hot gas entropy, mimicking a cooling flow.

  Ambiguity resolution of GPS carrier phase observables is crucial in high
precision geodetic positioning and navigation applications. It consists of two
aspects: estimating the integer ambiguities in the mixed integer observation
model and examining whether they are sufficiently accurate to be fixed as known
nonrandom integers. We shall discuss the first point in this paper from the
point of view of integer programming. A one-step nonexact approach is proposed
by employing minimum diagonal pivoting Gaussian decompositions, which may be
thought of as an improvement of the simple rounding-off method, since the
weights and correlations of the floating-estimated ambiguities are fully taken
into account. The second approach is to reformulate the mixed integer least
squares problem into the standard 0-1 linear integer programming model, which
can then be solved by using, for instance, the practically robust and efficient
simplex algorithm for linear integer programming. It is exact, if proper bounds
for the ambiguities are given. Theoretical results on decorrelation by
unimodular transformation are given in the form of a theorem.

introduces the bifurcation digraph, an extension of the lattice of isotropy

symmetry types of solutions to the PDE and the 59 generic symmetry-breaking
bifurcations among these symmetry types. Our numerical code uses continuation
methods, and follows branches created at symmetry-breaking bifurcations, so the
human user does not need to supply initial guesses for Newton's method.
Starting from the known trivial solution, the code automatically finds at least
one solution with each of the symmetry types that we predict can exist. Such
computationally intensive investigations necessitated the writing of automated
branch following code, whereby symmetry information was used to reduce the

generally accepted solution to date. Since a racemic mixture of chiral
nucleotides frustrates the extension and replication of RNA and DNA,
understanding the origin of homochirality has important implications to the
investigation of the origin of life. Here we suggest a novel solution to the
homochirality problem based on a recently proposed thermodynamic dissipation
theory for the origin of life. Homochirality is suggested to have been
incorporated gradually into the emerging life as a result of asymmetric right-
over left-handed photon-induced denaturation of RNA/DNA occurring when Archean
sea surface temperatures became close to the denaturing temperatures of
RNA/DNA. This differential denaturing success would have been promoted by the
somewhat right-handed circularly polarized submarine light of the late
afternoon when surface water temperatures are highest, and a negative circular
dichroism band extending from 220 nm up to 260 nm for small segments of
RNA/DNA. A numerical model is presented demonstrating the efficacy of such a
mechanism in procuring 100% homochirality of RNA or DNA from an original
racemic solution in less than 500 Archean years assuming a photon absorption
threshold for replication representing the hydrogen bonding energies between
complimentary strands. Because cholesteric D-nucleic acids have greater
affinity for L-amino acids due to a positive structural complementarity, and
because D-RNA/DNA+L-amino acid complexes also have a negative circular
dichroism band between 200 - 300 nm, the homochirality of amino acids can also
be explained by the theory.

is strongly dependent on the accuracy with which the antenna primary beam is
calibrated. The next generation of radio telescope arrays such as the Allen
Telescope Array (ATA) and the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) have key science
goals that involve making large mosaicked observations filled with bright point
sources. We present a new method for calibrating the shape of the telescope's
mean primary beam that uses the multiple redundant observations of these bright
sources in the mosaic. The method has an analytical solution for simple
Gaussian beam shapes but can also be applied to more complex beam shapes
through $\chi^2$ minimization. One major benefit of this simple, conceptually
clean method is that it makes use of the science data for calibration purposes,
thus saving telescope time and improving accuracy through simultaneous
calibration and observation. We apply the method both to 1.43 GHz data taken
during the ATA Twenty Centimeter Survey (ATATS) and to 3.14 GHz data taken
during the ATA's Pi Gigahertz Sky Survey (PiGSS). We find that the beam's
calculated full width at half maximum (FWHM) values are consistent with the
theoretical values, the values measured by several independent methods, and the
values from the simulation we use to demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method on data from future telescopes such as the expanded ATA and the SKA.
These results are preliminary, and can be expanded upon by fitting more complex
beam shapes. We also investigate, by way of a simulation, the dependence of the
accuracy of the telescope's FWHM on antenna number. We find that the
uncertainty returned by our fitting method is inversely proportional to the
number of antennas in the array.

between two non-degenerate cavity modes. The scheme relies on the interaction
of the cavity modes with driven two or three-level atoms which act as a coupler
to build entanglement between the modes. We show that in the limit of a strong
driving, crucial for the generation of entanglement between the modes is to
imbalance populations of the dressed states of the driven atomic transition. In
the case of a three-level V-type atom, we find that a stationary entanglement
can be created on demand by tuning the Rabi frequency of the driving field to
the difference between the atomic transition frequencies. The resulting
degeneracy of the energy levels together with the spontaneously generated
coherence generates a steady-state entanglement between the cavity modes. It is

Lifshitz theories, which introduce higher-order spatial derivatives, need not

Given
its large mass, its large radius cannot be explained by standard evolution
models. Interestingly, the planet's parent star is an active, rapidly rotating
solar-like star with a large fraction (7 to 20%) of spots. Aims: We want to
provide constraints on the properties of the star-planet system and understand
whether the planet's inferred large size may be due to a systematic error on
the inferred parameters, and if not, how it may be explained. Methods: We
combine stellar and planetary evolution codes based on all available
spectroscopic and photometric data to obtain self-consistent constraints on the
system parameters. Results: We find no systematic error in the stellar modeling
(including spots and stellar activity) that would yield the required ~10%
reduction in size for the star and thus the planet. Two classes of solutions
are found: the usual main sequence solution for the star yields for the planet
a mass of 3.67+/-0.13 Mjup, a radius of 1.55+/-0.03 Rjup for an age that is at
least 130Ma, and should be less than 500Ma given the star's fast rotation and
significant activity. We identify another class of solutions on the pre-main
sequence, in which case the planet's mass is 3.45\pm 0.27 Mjup, its radius is
1.50+/-0.06 Rjup for an age between 30 and 40 Ma. These extremely young
solutions provide the simplest explanation for the planet's size which can then
be matched by a simple contraction from an initially hot, expanded state,
provided the atmospheric opacities are increased by a factor ~3 compared to
usual assumptions for solar compositions atmospheres. Other solutions imply in
any case that the present inflated radius of CoRoT-2b is transient and the
result of an event that occurred less than 20 Ma ago: a giant impact with
another Jupiter-mass planet, or interactions with another object in the system
which caused a significant rise of the eccentricity followed by the rapid
circularization of its orbit. Conclusions: Additional observations of CoRoT-2
that could help understanding this system include searches for infrared excess
and the presence of a debris disk and searches for additional companions. The
determination of a complete infrared lightcurve including both the primary and
secondary transits would also be extremely valuable to constrain the planet's
atmospheric properties and to determine the planet-to-star radius ratio in a
manner less vulnerable to systematic errors due to stellar activity.

selectively entrains grains of different sizes at different radii resulting in
a dust population that varies spatially and increases with height above the
disc at radii > 10 AU. This variable grain population results in a 'wingnut'
morphology to the dust density distribution. We calculate images of this dust
distribution at NIR wavelengths that also show a wingnut morphology at all
wavelengths considered. We have also considered the contribution that
crystalline dust grains will have in the wind and show that a photoevaporative
wind can result in a significant crystallinity fraction at all radii, when the
disc is edge-on. However, when the disc's photosphere is unobscured, a
photoevaporative wind makes no contribution to the observable crystallinity
fraction in the disc. Finally, we conclude that the analysis of extended
emission around edge-on discs could provide a new and independent method of
testing photoevaporation models.

processors must power-down their radios in order to save energy. Energy
efficiency is a central goal in wireless networks, especially if energy
resources are severely limited. In the current setting, the problem is to
synchronize clocks of $m$ processors that wake up in arbitrary time points,
such that the maximum difference between wake up times is bounded by a positive
integer $n$, where time intervals are appropriately discretized. Currently, the
best-known results for synchronization for single-hop networks of $m$
processors is a randomized algorithm due to \cite{BKO09} of O(\sqrt {n /m}
\cdot poly-log(n)) awake times per processor and a lower bound of
Omega(\sqrt{n/m}) of the number of awake times needed per processor
\cite{BKO09}. The main open question left in their work is to close the
poly-log gap between the upper and the lower bound and to de-randomize their
probabilistic construction and eliminate error probability. This is exactly
what we do in this paper.
  That is, we show a {deterministic} algorithm with radio use of Theta(\sqrt {n
/m}) that never fails. We stress that our upper bound exactly matches the lower
bound proven in \cite{BKO09}, up to a small multiplicative constant. Therefore,
our algorithm is {optimal} in terms of energy efficiency and completely
resolves a long sequence of works in this area. In order to achieve these
results we devise a novel {adaptive} technique that determines the times when
devices power their radios on and off. In addition, we prove several lower
bounds on the energy efficiency of algorithms for {multi-hop networks}.
Specifically, we show that any algorithm for multi-hop networks must have radio
use of Omega(\sqrt n) per processor.

susceptibility shows linear behaviour in a wide temperature range, confirming
well localized isotropic moments for the RE$^{3+}$ ions. Exceptionally for the

possibly due to significant crystalline field splitting or valence fluctuation.
For RE = Tb, the susceptibility measurement clearly shows a bifurcation of the

suggesting a spin-glass-like freezing. On the other hand, neutron scattering
measurements detect significant development of short-range antiferromagnetic

given an isodiametric set, and up to negligible sets, we prove that its
boundary is given by the graphs of two locally Lipschitz functions. Moreover,
in the restricted class of rotationally invariant sets, we give a quite
complete characterization of any compact (rotationally invariant) isodiametric

ratio is 250. The peak Lorentz factor of the electrons is determined, along
with the orientation & strength of the magnetic field at the cloud collision
boundary. The magnetic field component orthogonal to the initial plasma flow
direction is amplified to values that exceed those expected from shock
compression by over an order of magnitude. The forming shock is
quasi-perpendicular due to this amplification, caused by a current sheet which
develops in response to the differing deflection of the incoming upstream
electrons & ions. The electron deflection implies a charge separation of the
upstream electrons & ions; the resulting electric field drags the electrons
through the magnetic field, whereupon they acquire a relativistic mass
comparable to the ions. We demonstrate how a magnetic field structure
resembling the cross section of a flux tube grows in the current sheet of the
shock transition layer. Plasma filamentation develops, as well as signatures of
orthogonal magnetic field striping. Localized magnetic bubbles form. Energy
equipartition between the ion, electron & magnetic energy is obtained at the

between species. Our analysis is in much the same spirit as that of Goldreich &
Reisenegger (1992), and we content ourselves with rough estimates of magnetic
diffusion timescales, rather than solving accurately for some particular field
geometry. However, our work improves upon previous treatments in one crucial
respect: we allow for superfluidity in the neutron star matter. We find that
the consequent mutual friction force, coupling the neutrons and charged
particles, together with the suppression of particles collisions and reactions,
drastically affect the ambipolar magnetic field diffusion timescale. In
particular, the addition of superfluidity means that it is unlikely that there
is ambipolar diffusion in magnetar cores on the timescale of the lifetimes of
these objects, contradicting an assumption often made in the modelling of the
flaring activity commonly observed in magnetars. Our work suggests that if a
decaying magnetic field is indeed the cause of magnetar activity, the field
evolution is likely to take place outside of the core, and might represent
Hall/Ohmic diffusion in the stellar crust, or else that a mechanism other than
standard ambipolar diffusion is active, e.g. flux expulsion due to the
interaction between neutron vortices and magnetic fluxtubes.

Starting from neutron star cooling theory, we formulate a robust method to
extract neutrino cooling rates of thermally relaxed stars at the neutrino
cooling stage from observations of thermal surface radiation. We show how to
compare these rates with the rates of standard candles -- stars with
non-superfluid nucleon cores cooling slowly via the modified Urca process. We
find that the internal temperature of standard candles is a well-defined
function of the stellar compactness parameter $x=r_g/R$, irrespective of the
equation of state of neutron star matter ($R$ and $r_g$ are circumferential and
gravitational radii, respectively). We demonstrate that the data on the

$f_\ell$, the neutrino cooling efficiency with respect to the standard candle;
the compactness $x$; and the amount of light elements in the heat blanketing

improving understanding of transcriptional responses of tumors to changes in
the pH level of the cellular microenvironment. The statistical focus is on
connecting experimentally defined biomarkers of such responses to clinical
outcome in observational studies of breast cancer patients. Our analysis
exemplifies a general strategy for accomplishing this kind of integration
across contexts. The statistical methodologies employed here draw heavily on
Bayesian sparse factor models for identifying, modularizing and correlating
with clinical outcome these signatures of aggregate changes in gene expression.
By projecting patterns of biological response linked to specific experimental
interventions into observational studies where such responses may be evidenced
via variation in gene expression across samples, we are able to define
biomarkers of clinically relevant physiological states and outcomes that are
rooted in the biology of the original experiment. Through this approach we
identify microenvironment-related prognostic factors capable of predicting long
term survival in two independent breast cancer datasets. These results suggest
possible directions for future laboratory studies, as well as indicate the
potential for therapeutic advances though targeted disruption of specific

of stable Minkowski and AdS N=1 vacua in spontaneously broken gauged N=2

redshifts, rest-frame colours, and stellar masses. We furthermore provide an
analysis of the selection methods for finding massive galaxies at high

through different methods overlap. We find that a single colour selection
method cannot locate all of the massive galaxies, with no one method finding
more than 70 percent. We however find that the combination of these colour
methods finds nearly all the massive galaxies, as selected by photometric
redshifts with the exception of apparently rare blue massive galaxies. By
investigating the rest-frame (U-B) vs. M_B diagram for these galaxies we
furthermore show that there exists a bimodality in colour-magnitude space at z
< 2, driven by stellar mass, such that the most massive galaxies are
systematically red up to z~2.5, while lower mass galaxies tend to be blue. We
also discuss the number densities for galaxies with stellar masses M_* > 10^11

is ~30 degrees, and the inferred disk molecular gas mass is ~3 Earth masses. MP
Mus thereby joins TW Hya and V4046 Sgr as the only late-type (low-mass), pre-MS
star systems within ~100 pc of Earth that are known to retain orbiting,
molecular disks. We also report the nondetection (with the Institut de Radio
Astronomie Millimetrique 30 m telescope) of CO emission from another ten nearby
(D ~ 100 pc or less), dusty, young (age ~10-100 Myr) field stars of spectral
type A-G. We discuss the implications of these results for the timescales for
stellar and Jovian planet accretion from, and dissipation of, molecular disks
around young stars.

method of modulated gradient spin echo show features in the low frequency range
up to a few kHz, which can be explained reasonably well by a $t^{-3/2}$ long
time tail decay only for non-polar liquid toluene, while the spectra of polar
liquids, such as ethanol, water and glycerol, are more congruent with the model
of diffusion of particles temporarily trapped in potential wells created by
their neighbors. As the method provides the spectrum averaged over ensemble of
particle trajectories, the initial non-exponential decay of spin echoes is
attributed to a spatial heterogeneity of molecular motion in a bulk of liquid,
reflected in distribution of the echo decays for short trajectories. While at
longer time intervals, and thus with longer trajectories, heterogeneity is
averaged out, giving rise to a spectrum which is explained as a combination of
molecular self-diffusion and eddy diffusion within the vortexes of hydrodynamic
fluctuations.

information provided by the deep Balloon-borne Large-Aperture Submillimeter
Telescope surveys at 250, 350 and 500 micron, as well as other FIR and
millimetre data. Unlike most other phenomenological models, we characterise the
uncertainties in our fitted parameters using Monte Carlo Markov Chains. We use
a bivariate local luminosity function that depends only on FIR luminosity and
60-to-100 micron colour, along with a single library of galaxy spectral energy
distributions indexed by colour, and apply simple luminosity and density
evolution. We use the surface density of sources, Cosmic Infrared Background
(CIB) measurements and redshift distributions of bright sources, for which
identifications have been made, to constrain this model. The precise evolution
of the FIR luminosity function across this crucial range has eluded studies at
longer wavelengths (e.g., using SCUBA and MAMBO) and at shorter wavelengths
(e.g., Spitzer), and should provide a key piece of information required for the
study of galaxy evolution. Our adoption of Monte Carlo methods enables us not
only to find the best-fit evolution model, but also to explore correlations
between the fitted parameters. Our model-fitting approach allows us to focus on
sources of tension coming from the combination of data-sets. We specifically
find that our choice of parameterisation has difficulty fitting the combination
of CIB measurements and redshift distribution of sources near 1 mm. Existing
and future data sets will be able to dramatically improve the fits, as well as
break strong degeneracies among the models. [abridged]

that can be explained by a local model, and show that it forms a polytope,
larger than the Bell local polytope. We characterize the facets of this

a one-dimensional filled lattice, or equivalently of a one-dimensional

The three types of particles are designated as $A$, $B$, and $C$. The system is
described by a grand canonical ensemble with temperature $T$ and chemical
potentials $T\lambda_A$, $T\lambda_B$, and $T\lambda_C$. We find that for
$\lambda_A=\lambda_B=\lambda_C$ the system undergoes a phase transition from a
uniform density to a continuum of phases at a critical temperature $\hat
T_c=(2\pi/\sqrt3)^{-1}$. For other values of the chemical potentials the system
has a unique equilibrium state. As is the case for the canonical ensemble for
this $ABC$ model, the grand canonical ensemble is the stationary measure
satisfying detailed balance for a natural dynamics. We note that $\hat
T_c=3T_c$, where $T_c$ is the critical temperature for a similar transition in
the canonical ensemble at fixed equal densities $r_A=r_B=r_C=1/3$.
