unique opportunity to test galaxy formation models as well as impose strong
constraints on the history of star formation and stellar nucleosynthesis.
  The aims of this paper are to compare abundance predictions from a detailed
chemical evolution model for the bulge with the newest data. Some of the
predictions have already appeared on previous paper (O, Mg, Si, S and Ca) but
some other predictions are new (Ba, Cr and Ti).
  We compute several chemical evolution models by adopting different initial
mass functions for the Galactic bulge and then compare the results to new data
including both giants and dwarf stars in the bulge. In this way we can impose
strong constraints on the star formation history of the bulge.
  We find that in order to reproduce at best the metallicity distribution
function one should assume a flat IMF for the bulge not steeper than the
Salpeter one. The initial mass function derived for the solar vicinity provides
instead a very poor fit to the data. The [el/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] relations in the
bulge are well reproduced by a very intense star formation rate and a flat IMF
as in the case of the stellar metallicity distribution. Our model predicts that
the bulge formed very quickly with the majority of stars formed inside the
first 0.5 Gyr.
  Our results strongly suggest that the new data, and in particular the MDF of
the bulge, confirm what concluded before and in particular that the bulge
formed very fast, from gas shed by the halo, and that the initial mass function
was flatter than in the solar vicinity and in the disk, although not so flat as
previously thought. Finally, our model can also reproduce the decrease of the
[O/Mg] ratio for [Mg/H] > 0 in the bulge, which is confirmed by the new data
and interpreted as due to mass loss in massive stars.

work uniformly for a wide range of relaxation times and avoid the solution of
nonlinear systems of equations even in stiff regimes. We give sufficient

the correct asymptotic behavior for small relaxation times. The methods also
offer favorable properties such as nonnegativity of the solution and entropy

approach, we show that the large majority of galaxies within group- and
cluster-mass halos have acquired the bulk of their stellar mass through gas
accretion and not via galaxy mergers. We deduce that most dwarf ellipticals are
not built up by galaxy mergers. With the second approach, we constrain the star
formation histories of dwarfs by requiring that star formation must occur
within halos of a minimum circular velocity set by the evolution of the
temperature of the IGM, starting before the epoch of reionization. We
qualitatively reproduce the downsizing trend of greater ages at greater masses
and predict an upsizing trend of greater ages as one proceeds to masses lower

populations (more than half the mass formed within the last 1.5 Gyr) is a
function of present-day mass in stars and cold gas, which peaks at 0.5% at

axisymmetric accretion theory must be used as a mean field theory: turbulent
flows are at most axisymmetric only when suitably averaged. Spectral
predictions therefore have an intrinsic imprecision that must be quantified to
interpret the variability exhibited by a source observed at different epochs.
We quantify contributions to the stochastic imprecision that come from
azimuthal and radial averaging and show that the imprecision is minimized for a
particular choice of radial averaging, which in turn, corresponds to an optimal
spectral resolution of a telescope for a spatially unresolved source. If the
optimal spectral resolution is less than that of the telescope then the data
can be binned to compare to the theoretical prediction of minimum imprecision.
Little stochastic variability is predicted at radii much larger than that at
which the dominant eddy turnover time ($\sim$ orbit time) exceeds the time
interval between observations; the epochs would then be sampling the same
member of the stochastic ensemble. We discuss the application of these
principles to protoplanetary discs for which there is presently a paucity of
multi-epoch data but for which such data acquisition projects are underway.

where they are disrupted by tidal forces from the star. Dust grows and
sediments inside the clumps, displaying a very strong segregation, with the
largest particles forming dense cores in the centres. The density of the dust

Poisson bracket defined on a manifold. The difference between both worlds is
due to the presence of extra structure in the quantum case, that leads to the
appearance of the probabilistic nature of the measurements and the
indetermination and superposition principles. In this paper we first show that
the quantum-classical dynamics prescribed by the Ehrenfest equations can also
be formulated within this general framework, what has been used in the
literature to construct propagation schemes for Ehrenfest dynamics. Then, the
existence of a well defined Poisson bracket allows to arrive to a Liouville
equation for a statistical ensemble of Ehrenfest systems. The study of a
generic toy model shows that the evolution produced by Ehrenfest dynamics is
ergodic and therefore the only constants of motion are functions of the

gains offered by advanced interference management techniques such as multiuser
MIMO and interference alignment. Such CSIT is usually obtained by feedback from
the receivers, but the feedback is subject to delays. The usual approach is to
use the fed back information to predict the current channel state and then
apply a scheme designed assuming perfect CSIT. When the feedback delay is large
compared to the channel coherence time, such a prediction approach completely
fails to achieve any multiplexing gain. In this paper, we show that even in
this case, the completely stale CSI is still very useful. More concretely, we
show that in a MIMO broadcast channel with $K$ transmit antennas and $K$
receivers each with 1 receive antenna, $\frac{K}{1+1/2+ ...+ \frac{1}{K}} (> 1)
$ degrees of freedom is achievable even when the fed back channel state is
completely independent of the current channel state. Moreover, we establish
that if all receivers have independent and identically distributed channels,
then this is the optimal number of degrees of freedom achievable. In the
optimal scheme, the transmitter uses the fed back CSI to learn the side
information that the receivers receive from previous transmissions rather than
to predict the current channel state. Our result can be viewed as the first
example of feedback providing a degree-of-freedom gain in memoryless channels.

the medium participates as a whole. In two previous papers \cite{PG00,GP00}, we
treated this problem for the case of a medium having slab geometry, which,
under plane wave excitation, supports coherent waves that propagate in one
dimension. We extend the treatment here to the three-dimensional problem,
focusing principally on the case of spherical geometry. By regarding the
radiation field as a superposition of electric and magnetic multipole fields of
different orders, we express it in terms of suitably defined scalar fields. The
latter fields possess a sequence of exponentially decaying eigenmodes
corresponding to each multipole order. We consider several examples of
spherically symmetric initial excitations of a sphere. Small uniformly excited
spheres, we find, tend to radiate superradiantly, while the radiation from a
large sphere with an initially excited inner core exhibits temporal
oscillations that result from the participation of a large number of coherently
excited amplitudes in different modes. The frequency spectrum of the emitted
radiation possesses a rich structure, including a frequency gap for large
spheres and sharply defined and closely spaced peaks caused by the small
frequency shifts and even smaller decay rates characteristic of the majority of
eigenmodes.

perturbative QCD predictions in measurements of inclusive hadron cross sections
at fixed x_T= 2p_T/\sqrt s, as well as the ""baryon anomaly"", the anomalously
large proton-to-pion ratio seen in high centrality heavy ion collisions.
Initial-state and final-state interactions of the struck quark lead to
Bjorken-scaling single-spin asymmetries, diffractive deep inelastic scattering,
the breakdown of the Lam-Tung relation in Drell-Yan reactions, as well as
nuclear shadowing and antishadowing. The Gribov-Glauber theory predicts that
antishadowing of nuclear structure functions is not universal, but instead
depends on the flavor quantum numbers of each quark and antiquark, thus
explaining the anomalous nuclear dependence measured in deep-inelastic neutrino
scattering. One cannot attribute such phenomena to the structure of the hadron
or nucleus itself. It is thus important to distinguish ""static"" structure
functions computed from the square of the target light-front wavefunctions,
versus ""dynamical"" structure functions which include the effects of the
final-state rescattering of the struck quark. The importance of the J=0
photon-quark QCD contact interaction in deeply virtual Compton scattering is
emphasized. The scheme-independent BLM method for setting the renormalization
scale is discussed. Eliminating the renormalization scale ambiguity greatly
improves the precision of QCD predictions and increases the sensitivity of
searches for new physics at the LHC. Other novel features of QCD are discussed,

potential is interpreted as a randomly moving catalyst or trap. In the trap
case, i.e., $\gamma<0$, we look at the annealed time asymptotics in terms of
the first moment of $u$. Given a localized initial condition, we derive the
asymptotic rate of decay to zero in dimensions 1 and 2 up to equivalence and
characterize the limit in dimensions 3 and higher in terms of the Green's
function of a random walk. For a homogeneous initial condition we give a
characterisation of the limit in dimension 1 and show that the moments remain
constant for all time in dimensions 2 and higher. In the case of a moving
catalyst ($\gamma>0$), we consider the solution $u$ from the perspective of the
catalyst, i.e., the expression $u(t,Y_t+x)$. Focusing on the cases where
moments grow exponentially fast (that is, $\gamma$ sufficiently large), we
describe the moment asymptotics of the expression above up to equivalence.
Here, it is crucial to prove the existence of a principal eigenfunction of the
corresponding Hamilton operator. While this is well-established for the first
moment, we have found an extension to higher moments.

susceptible individuals protect themselves by disconnecting their links to

from a phase (w >= w_c) where the disease does not spread out. We find that in

We perform a large suite of numerical simulations, using them to calibrate a

cross-validation, a statistical technique which prevents over-fitting of the
data, this framework allows us to reconstruct the power spectrum shape without
strong prior assumptions. We find no evidence for deviation from
scale-invariance; our analysis also shows that current Lyman alpha data do not
have sufficient statistical power to robustly probe the shape of the power
spectrum at these scales. In contrast, the ongoing Baryon Oscillation Sky

near-future data will be able to break degeneracies between the power spectrum

of trigger orientation with respect to the reaction plane. The particles are at
larger momentum than where jet shape modifications have been observed, and the
correlations are sensitive to the energy loss of partons traveling through hot
dense matter. An out-of-plane trigger particle produces only 26+/-20% of the
away-side pairs that are observed opposite of an in-plane trigger particle. In
contrast, near-side jet fragments are consistent with no suppression or
dependence on trigger orientation with respect to the reaction plane. These
observations are qualitatively consistent with a picture of little near-side
parton energy loss either due to surface bias or fluctuations and increased
away-side parton energy loss due to a long path through the medium. The
away-side suppression as a function of reaction-plane angle is shown to be
sensitive to both the energy loss mechanism in and the space-time evolution of
heavy-ion collisions.

fuzzy (where each vertex belongs to each community to a different extent). We
investigate the effects of the fuzziness of community overlap. We find that it
has a strong effect on the performance of community detection methods: some
algorithms perform better with fuzzy overlapping while others favour crisp
overlapping. We also evaluate the performance of some algorithms that recover

morphological variation between individual rest-frame ultraviolet bandpasses in
z~3.2 galaxies argues against large ICDs being caused by non-uniform dust
distributions. Furthermore, the absence of a correlation between ICD and galaxy
UV-optical color suggests that the non-zero ICDs in SFGs are produced by
spatially distinct stellar populations with different ages. The SFGs with the
largest ICDs (>~0.05) generally have complex morphologies that are both
extended and asymmetric, suggesting that they are mergers-in-progress or very
large galaxies in the act of formation. We also find a correlation between
half-light radius and internal color dispersion, a fact that is not reflected
by the difference in half-light radii between bandpasses. In general, we find
that it is better to use diagnostics like the ICD to measure the morphological
properties of the difference image than it is to measure the difference in

disk from the disrupted companion inside a common envelope can dramatically
amplify magnetic fields via a dynamo. Here, we show that these disk-generated

the virial radius of their hosts from specific ""spots"" with respect to the
large scale structure. Furthermore, material which is tidally stripped from
these satellites is also, at z=0, distributed anisotropically and is
characterized by an ellipsoidal sub-volume embedded in the halo. The angular
pattern created by the locus of satellite infall points and the projected
stripped DM is investigated within a coordinate system determined by the
location of the LG companion and the simulated Virgo cluster across concentric
shells ranging from 0.1 to 5 r_vir. Remarkably, the principal axis of the
ellipsoidal sub-volume shows a coherent alignment extending from well within
the halo to a few r_vir. A spherical harmonics transform applied to the angular
distributions confirms the visual impression: namely, the angular distributions
of both the satellites entry points and stripped DM is dominated by the l=2
quadrupole term, whose major principal axis is aligned across the shells
considered. It follows that the structure of the outer (r>0.5 r_vir) regions of
the main halos is closely related to the cosmic web within which it is
embedded. Given the hypothesis that a large fraction of the stellar halo of the
Milky Way has been accreted from satellites, the present results can be applied
to the stellar halo of the MW and M31. We predict that the remnants of tidally
stripped satellites should be embedded in streams of material composed of dark
matter and stars. The present results can therefore shed light on the existence
of satellites embedded within larger streams of matter, such as the Segue 2

What happens to this stellar gas? Using an Eulerian nested grid code, we
present 3D simulations to determine how stellar wind material evolves within
the GC environment. We expand upon work done in the 70's and move a single-mass
King-model GC through the Galactic halo medium, stripping a 10^5 Msun GC of its
intra-cluster medium but predicting a detectable medium for a 10^6 Msun
cluster. We find from new multi-mass King model simulations, the first to
incorporate empirical mass-loss formulae, that the single-mass King model
underestimates the retention of intra-cluster gas in the cluster. Lastly, we
present a simple discretised multi-mass GC model, which yields lower levels of
intra-cluster medium compared to the continuous single- and multi-mass King
models. Our results show that there is still an issue with the predicted
intra-cluster gas content of massive GCs. We conclude that by modelling GC
systems more accurately, in particular the stellar structure and description of
mass loss, we will be able to work towards resolving this issue and begin to
fill in some of the gaps in our understanding of the evolution of globular
clusters.

along with extended long-slit stellar kinematics. This is the first such
analysis of a galaxy from our survey with a radially constant velocity
dispersion profile. We find that the spatial and kinematical distributions of
the PNe agree with the field stars in the region of overlap. The velocity
kurtosis is consistent with zero at almost all radii. We construct a series of
Jeans models, fitting both velocity dispersion and kurtosis to help break the
mass-anisotropy degeneracy. Our mass models include DM halos either with
shallow cores or with central cusps as predicted by cosmological simulations -
along with the novel introduction in this context of adiabatic halo contraction
from baryon infall. Both classes of models confirm a very massive dark halo
around NGC 4374, demonstrating that PN kinematics data are well able to detect
such haloes when present. Considering the default cosmological mass model, we
confirm earlier suggestions that bright galaxies tend to have halo
concentrations higher than LCDM predictions, but this is found to be solved if
either a Salpeter IMF or adiabatic contraction with a Kroupa IMF is assumed.
Thus for the first time a case is found where the PN dynamics may well be
consistent with a standard dark matter halo. A cored halo can also fit the
data, and prefers a stellar mass consistent with a Salpeter IMF. The less
dramatic dark matter content found in lower-luminosity ""ordinary"" ellipticals
suggests a bimodality in the halo properties which may be produced by divergent
baryonic effects during their assembly histories.

the velocity and star formation from Halpha emission at a physical resolution

Much less is known, however, if (and how) the Sigma_SFR-Sigma_H2 relation
depends on environmental parameters, such as the metallicity or the UV
radiation field in the interstellar medium (ISM). Furthermore, observations
indicate that the scatter in the Sigma_SFR-Sigma_H2 relation increases rapidly
with decreasing averaging scale. How the scale-dependent scatter is generated
and how one recovers a tight ~ kpc scale Sigma_SFR-Sigma_H2 relation in the
first place is still largely debated. Here, these questions are explored with
hydrodynamical simulations that follow the formation and destruction of H2,
include radiative transfer of UV radiation, and resolve the ISM on ~60 pc
scales. We find that within the considered range of H2 surface densities
(10-100 Msun/pc^2) the Sigma_SFR-Sigma_H2 relation is steeper in environments
of low metallicity and/or high radiation fields (compared to the Galaxy), that
the star formation rate at a given H2 surface density is larger, and the
scatter is increased. Deviations from a ""universal"" Sigma_SFR-Sigma_H2 relation
should be particularly relevant for high redshift galaxies or for
low-metallicity dwarfs at z~0. We also find that the use of time-averaged SFRs
produces a large, scale dependent scatter in the Sigma_SFR-Sigma_H2 relation.
Given the plethora of observational data expected from upcoming surveys such as
ALMA the scale-scatter relation may indeed become a valuable tool for
determining the physical mechanisms connecting star formation and H2 formation.

motivation to probe the deuteron at small internucleon distances. For this, two
main issues are studied: electromagnetic interaction of the virtual photon with
the bound nucleon and the strong interactions of the produced baryons in the
final state of the reaction. Within virtual nucleon approximation we developed
a new prescription to account for the bound nucleon effects in the
electromagnetic interaction. The final state interaction at high $Q^2$
kinematics is calculated within generalized eikonal approximation ~ (GEA).
Comparison with the first experimental data confirm GEA's early prediction that
the rescattering is maximal at $\sim 70^0$ of recoil nucleon production
relative to the momentum of the virtual photon. Also the forward recoil nucleon
angles are best suited for studies of the deuteron at small distances.

dark energy models. In the case of modified theories of gravity, where the
equations of motion are generally quite complicated, cosmography can contribute
to select realistic models without imposing arbitrary choices a priori. Indeed,
its reliability is based on the assumptions that the universe is homogeneous
and isotropic on large scale and luminosity distance can be ""tracked"" by the
derivative series of the scale factor a(t). We apply this approach to induced
gravity brane-world models where an f(R)-term is present in the brane effective

DGP branch once the f(R)-term deviates from the Hilbert-Einstein action. We
show that the model, coming from a fundamental theory, is consistent with the
LCDM scenario at low redshift. We finally estimate the cosmographic parameters

from Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and then provide constraints on the

nanowires being studied are up to 50 {\AA}. As shown in our calculations, the
Ge [110] nanowires possess a direct band gap, in contrast to the nature of an
indirect band gap in bulk. We discovered that the band gap and the effective
masses of charge carries can be modulated by applying uniaxial strain to the
nanowires. These strain modulations are size-dependent. For a smaller wire (~
12 {\AA}), the band gap is almost a linear function of strain; compressive
strain increases the gap while tensile strain reduces the gap. For a larger
wire (20 {\AA} - 50 {\AA}), the variation of the band gap with respect to
strain shows nearly parabolic behavior: compressive strain beyond -1% also
reduces the gap. In addition, our studies showed that strain affects effective
masses of the electron and hole very differently. The effective mass of the
hole increases with a tensile strain while the effective mass of the electron
increases with a compressive strain. Our results suggested both strain and size
can be used to tune the band structures of nanowires, which may help in design
of future nano-electronic devices. We also discussed our results by applying

vectors far away from {\Gamma}, the variation of the conduction/valence band
with strain is much reduced. In addition, with a sufficient tensile strain
(~1%), the valence band edge (VBE) shifts away from {\Gamma}, which indicates
that the band gap of the Si/Ge core-shell nanowires experiences a transition
from direct to indirect. Our studies further showed that effective masses of

(varying between r0=5.5+-0.6 h^-1 Mpc for <z>=0.37 and r0=6.9+-1.0 h^-1 Mpc for

these measurements to show that the Chandra/Bootes AGNs are predominantly
located at the centers of dark matter halos with the circular velocity Vmax>320

of this or higher mass. The halo occupation properties inferred from the
clustering properties of Chandra/Bootes AGNs --- the mass scale of the parent

D",,"10.1142/S0218271812500277",,"gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There is growing notion that black holes may not contain curvature
singularities (and that indeed nature in general may abhor such spacetime
defects). This notion could have implications on our understanding of the
evolution of primordial black holes (PBHs) and possibly on their contribution
to cosmic energy. This paper discusses the evolution of a non-singular black
hole (NSBH) based on a recent model [1]. We begin with a study of the
thermodynamic process of the black hole in this model, and demonstrate the
existence of a maximum horizon temperature T_{max}, corresponding to a unique
mass value. At this mass value the specific heat capacity C changes signs to
positive and the body begins to lose its black hole characteristics. With no
loss of generality, the model is used to discuss the time evolution of a
primordial black hole (PBH), through the early radiation era of the universe to
present, under the assumption that PBHs are non-singular. In particular, we
track the evolution of two benchmark PBHs, namely the one radiating up to the
end of the cosmic radiation domination era, and the one stopping to radiate
currently, and in each case determine some useful features including the
initial mass m_{f} and the corresponding time of formation t_{f}. It is found
that along the evolutionary history of the universe the distribution of PBH
remnant masses (PBH-RM) PBH-RMs follows a power law. We believe such a result
can be a useful step in a study to establish current abundance of PBH-MRs.

disks are determined by the types of environments they are exposed to and their
residence times within each environment. Here a method for calculating
representative paths of materials in diffusive protoplanetary disks is
developed and applied to understanding how the vertical trajectories that
particles take impact their overall evolution. The methods are general enough
to be applied to disks with uniform diffusivity, the so-called
""constant-$\alpha$"" cases, and disks with a spatially varying diffusivity, such
as expected in ""layered-disks."" The average long-term dynamical evolution of
small particles and gaseous molecules is independent of the specific form of
the diffusivity in that they spend comparable fractions of their lifetimes at
different heights in the disk. However, the paths that individual particles and
molecules take depend strongly on the form of the diffusivity leading to a
different range of behavior of particles in terms of deviations from the mean.
As temperatures, gas densities, chemical abundances, and photon fluxes will
vary with height in protoplanetary disks, the different paths taken by
primitive materials will lead to differences in their chemical and physical
evolution. Examples of differences in gas phase chemistry and photochemistry
are explored here. The methods outlined here provide a means of integrating
particle dynamics with chemical models to understand the formation and
evolution of primitive materials in protoplanetary disks over timescales of

transport properties of a system in the two-level SU(2) (2LSU2) regime,
obtained from an SU(4) model Hamiltonian by introducing orbital mixing of the
degenerate orbitals via coupling to the leads. SU(4) Kondo physics has been
experimentally observed, and studied in detail, in Carbon Nanotube Quantum
Dots. Adopting a two molecular orbital basis, the Hamiltonian is recast into a
form where one of the molecular orbitals decouples from the charge reservoir,
although still interacting capacitively with the other molecular orbital. This
basis transformation explains in a clear way how the charge transport in this
system turns from double- to single-channel when it transitions from the SU(4)
to the 2LSU2 regime. The charge occupancy of these molecular orbitals displays
gate-potential-dependent occupancy oscillations that arise from a competition
between the Kondo and Intermediate Valence states. The determination of whether
the Kondo or the Intermediate Valence state is more favorable, for a specific
value of gate potential, is assessed by the definition of an energy scale
$T_0$, which is calculated through DMRG. We speculate that the calculation of
$T_0$ may provide experimentalists with a useful tool to analyze correlated
charge transport in many other systems. For that, a current work is underway to
improve the numerical accuracy of its DRMG calculation and explore different

prove for general node distributions and fading statistics that the success
probability $\p \sim 1-\gamma \eta^{\kappa}$ for $\eta \rightarrow 0$, and
provide values of $\gamma$ and $\kappa$ for a number of important special
cases. We show that $\kappa$ is lower bounded by 1 and upper bounded by a value
that depends on the path loss exponent and the fading. This new analytical
framework is then used to characterize the transmission capacity of a very
general class of networks, defined as the maximum spatial density of active
links given an outage constraint.

< 15.5, D25>1') survey of 2,331 galaxies using IRAC at 3.6 and 4.5 microns.
Each galaxy is observed for 240 s and mapped to > 1.5 x D25. The final
mosaicked images have a typical 1 sigma rms noise level of 0.0072 and 0.0093
MJy / sr at 3.6 and 4.5 microns, respectively. Our azimuthally-averaged surface
brightness profile typically traces isophotes at mu_3.6 (AB) (1 sigma) ~ 27 mag
arcsec^-2, equivalent to a stellar mass surface density of ~ 1 Msun pc^-2. S^4G
thus provides an unprecedented data set for the study of the distribution of
mass and stellar structures in the local Universe. This paper introduces the
survey, the data analysis pipeline and measurements for a first set of
galaxies, observed in both the cryogenic and warm mission phase of Spitzer. For
every galaxy we tabulate the galaxy diameter, position angle, axial ratio,
inclination at mu_3.6 (AB) = 25.5 and 26.5 mag arcsec^-2 (equivalent to ~ mu_B
(AB) =27.2 and 28.2 mag arcsec^-2, respectively). These measurements will form
the initial S^4G catalog of galaxy properties. We also measure the total
magnitude and the azimuthally-averaged radial profiles of ellipticity, position
angle, surface brightness and color. Finally, we deconstruct each galaxy using
GALFIT into its main constituent stellar components: the bulge/spheroid, disk,
bar, and nuclear point source, where necessary. Together these data products
will provide a comprehensive and definitive catalog of stellar structures, mass
and properties of galaxies in the nearby Universe.

extremes have become more extreme during the twentieth century, and that this
trend is likely to continue as global warming becomes more intense. However,
understanding these issues is limited by a fundamental issue of spatial
scaling: most evidence of past trends comes from rain gauge data, whereas
trends into the future are produced by climate models, which rely on gridded
aggregates. To study this further, we fit the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV)
distribution to the right tail of the distribution of both rain gauge and
gridded events. The results of this modeling exercise confirm that return
values computed from rain gauge data are typically higher than those computed
from gridded data; however, the size of the difference is somewhat surprising,
with the rain gauge data exhibiting return values sometimes two or three times
that of the gridded data. The main contribution of this paper is the
development of a family of regression relationships between the two sets of
return values that also take spatial variations into account. Based on these
results, we now believe it is possible to project future changes in
precipitation extremes at the point-location level based on results from
climate models.

perfect invisibility in isotropic media. A combination of positive and negative
refractive indices, called plus-minus construction, is essential to achieve

Contrary to the common understanding that between two isotropic materials
having different refractive indices the electromagnetic reflection is
unavoidable, our method shows that surprisingly the reflection phenomena can be
completely eliminated. The invented method, different from the classical
impedance matching, may also find electromagnetic applications outside of
cloaking devices, wherever distortions are present arising from reflections.

procedure, which estimates the distribution of the random effects, as opposed
to just a simple population average, suggests that the ESA may be beneficial to
mortality for approximately a quarter of the study populations. This new
meta-analysis technique can be implemented with study-level summary statistics.
In contrast to existing methods for parametric random effects models, the
validity of our proposal does not require the number of studies involved to be
large. From the results of an extensive numerical study, we find that the new

most important reaction mechanism is the sudden direct removal of a pair of
nucleons from a set of relatively simple, active shell-model orbital
configurations, such distributions were predicted to depend strongly on the
total angular momentum I carried by the two nucleons - the final state spin for
spin 0+ projectiles. The sensitivity of these now-accessible observables to
specific details of the (correlated) two-nucleon wave functions is of
importance. We clarify that it is the total orbital angular momentum L of the
two nucleons that is the primary factor in determining the shapes and widths of
the calculated momentum distributions. It follows that, with accurate
measurements, this dependence upon the L make-up of the two-nucleon wave
functions could be used to assess the accuracy of (shell- or many-body) model
predictions of these two-nucleon configurations. By use of several tailored
examples, with specific combinations of active two-nucleon orbitals, we
demonstrate that more subtle structure aspects may be observed, allowing such

compact extra dimension, without using fundamental branes. All that is required
are bulk scalar fields minimally coupled to gravity. Of crucial importance is
the stability of the size of the extra dimension. Without branes, one cannot
easily implement the Goldberger-Wise mechanism, and instead it must be shown
that the scalar configuration is stable in its own right. We use the
superpotential approach for generating solutions, the so called 'fake
supergravity' scenario, and show that configurations generated in such a way
are always free of tachyonic modes. Furthermore, we show that the model is also
free of zero modes (in the spin-0 sector) if all the scalars have odd parity.
We discuss the hierarchy problem in soft-wall models, and applications of our

is especially difficult since customers can ``switch'' to a competitor with the
click of a mouse. In this paper we investigate e-loyalty in online auctions.
Using a unique data set of over 30,000 auctions from one of the main
consumer-to-consumer online auction houses, we propose a novel measure of
e-loyalty via the associated network of transactions between bidders and
sellers. Using a bipartite network of bidder and seller nodes, two nodes are
linked when a bidder purchases from a seller and the number of repeat-purchases
determines the strength of that link. We employ ideas from functional principal
component analysis to derive, from this network, the loyalty distribution which
measures the perceived loyalty of every individual seller, and associated
loyalty scores which summarize this distribution in a parsimonious way. We then
investigate the effect of loyalty on the outcome of an auction. In doing so, we
are confronted with several statistical challenges in that standard statistical
models lead to a misrepresentation of the data and a violation of the model
assumptions. The reason is that loyalty networks result in an extreme
clustering of the data, with few high-volume sellers accounting for most of the
individual transactions. We investigate several remedies to the clustering
problem and conclude that loyalty networks consist of very distinct segments

distributional operations, one of which consists of multiplying a mean
functional by an independent beta random variable, the other being an operation
involving an exponential change of measure. These operations identify
relationships between different means and their densities. This allows one to
use the often considerable analytic work on obtaining results for one Dirichlet
mean to obtain results for an entire family of otherwise seemingly unrelated
Dirichlet means. Additionally, it allows one to obtain explicit densities for
the related class of random variables that have generalized gamma convolution
distributions and the finite-dimensional distribution of their associated
L\'{e}vy processes. The importance of this latter statement is that L\'{e}vy
processes now commonly appear in a variety of applications in probability and
statistics, but there are relatively few cases where the relevant densities
have been described explicitly. We demonstrate how the technique allows one to
obtain the finite-dimensional distribution of several interesting subordinators

estimation studies for different sources with the space based gravitational
wave detector, LISA. While these studies have investigated sources of differing
complexity, the one thing they all have in common is they assume continuous
data streams. In reality, the LISA data stream will contain gaps from such
possible events such as repointing of the satellite antennae, to discharging
static charge build up on the satellites, to disruptions due to micro-meteor
strikes. In this work we conduct a large scale Monte Carlo parameter estimation
simulation for galactic binaries assuming data streams containing gaps. As the
expected duration and frequency of the gaps are currently unknown, we have
decided to focus on gaps of approximately one hour, occurring either once per
day or once per week. We also study the case where, as well as the expected
periodic gaps, we have a data drop-out of one continuous week. Our results show
that for for galactic binaries, a gap of once per week introduces a bias of
between 0.5% and 1% in the estimation of parameters, for the most important
parameters such as the sky position, amplitude and frequency. This number rises
to between 3% and 7% for the case of one gap a day, and to between 4% and 9%
when we have one gap a day and a spurious gap of a week. A future study will
investigate the effect of data gaps on supermassive black hole binaries and
extreme mass ratio inspirals.

rotation in the (2N+1)-dimensional Euclidian space (N: number of
single-particle states of the fermions). The images of fermion
annihilation-creation operators must satisfy the canonical anti-commutation
relations, when they operate on a spinor subspace. In the regular
representation space we use a boson Hamiltonian with Lagrange multipliers to
select out the spinor subspace. Based on these facts, a new description of a
fermionic SO(2N+2) top is proposed. From the Heisenberg equations of motions
for the boson operators, we get the SO(2N+1) self-consistent field (SCF)
Hartree-Bogoliubov (HB) equation for the classical stationary motion of the
fermion top. Decomposing an SO(2N+1) matrix into matrices describing paired and
unpaired modes of fermions, we obtain a new form of the SO(2N+1) SCF equation
with respect to the paired-mode amplitudes. To demonstrate the effectiveness of
the new description based on the bosonization theory, the extended HB
eigenvalue equation is applied to a superconducting toy-model which consists of
a particle-hole plus BCS type interaction. It is solved to reach an interesting
and exciting solution which is not found in the traditional HB eigenvalue
equation, due to the unpaired-mode effects. To complete the new description,
the Lagrange multipliers must be determined in the classical limit. For this
aim a quasi anti-commutation-relation approximation is proposed. Only if a
certain relation between an SO(2N+1) parameter z and the N is satisfied,
unknown parameters k and l in the Lagrange multipliers can be determined

accessing the channel is unknown by the receiver. In this environment, users'
activity must be estimated along with any other parameters such as data, power,
and location. Our main goal is to determine the performance loss caused by the
need for estimating the identities of active users, which are not known a
priori. To prevent a loss of optimality, we assume that identities and data are
estimated jointly, rather than in two separate steps. We examine the
performance of multiuser detectors when the number of potential users is large.
Statistical-physics methodologies are used to determine the macroscopic
performance of the detector in terms of its multiuser efficiency. Special
attention is paid to the fixed-point equation whose solution yields the
multiuser efficiency of the optimal (maximum a posteriori) detector in the
large signal-to-noise ratio regime. Our analysis yields closed-form approximate
bounds to the minimum mean-squared error in this regime. These illustrate the
set of solutions of the fixed-point equation, and their relationship with the
maximum system load. Next, we study the maximum load that the detector can
support for a given quality of service (specified by error probability).

Methods. We present FLAMES/UVES spectroscopic observations of 20 members of the
ONC and OB1b. We measured radial velocity, veiling, effective temperature using
two spectroscopic methods, and determined the chemical abundances of Fe, Na,
Al, Si, Ca, Ti, and Ni using the code MOOG. We also performed a new consistent
analysis of spectra previously analyzed by our group. Results. We find three
new binaries in the ONC, two in OB1b, and three non-members in OB1b (two of
them most likely being OB1a/25 Ori members). Veiling only affects one target in
the ONC, and the effective temperatures derived using two spectroscopic
techniques agree within the errors. The ONC and OB1b are characterized by a
small scatter in iron abundance, with mean [Fe/H] values of -0.11+/-0.08 and
-0.05+/-0.05, respectively. We find a small scatter in all the other elemental

We conclude that the Orion metallicity is not above the solar value. The OB1b

sunspots near the top of the convection zone has generated some interest. The
presence of turbulence can strongly enhance diffusive transport mechanisms,
leading to an effective transport coefficient formalism in the mean-field
formulation. The question is what happens to these coefficients when the
turbulence becomes anisotropic due to a strong large-scale mean magnetic field.
It has been noted in the past that this anisotropy can also lead to highly
non-diffusive behaviour. In the present work we investigate the formation of
large-scale magnetic structures as a result of a negative contribution of
turbulence to the large-scale effective magnetic pressure in the presence of
stratification. In direct numerical simulations of forced turbulence in a
stratified box, we verify the existence of this effect. This phenomenon can
cause formation of large-scale magnetic structures even from initially uniform

detail in the case of the $^{12}$C + $^{12}$C system in the energy range of E/A

dependence of the real part of the DFM potentials and plays an important role
to lower the attractive-to-repulsive transition energy. The nearside and

close relation between the attractive-to-repulsive transition of the potentials
and the characteristic evolution of the calculated angular distributions with
the increase of the incident energy. Based on the present analysis, we propose

due to inconsistencies in the measured data arising from proton energy
straggling and multiple Coulomb scattering, noise in the reconstructed image
increases with successive iterations. In the current work, we investigated the
use of total variation superiorization (TVS) schemes that can be applied as an
algorithmic add-on to perturbation-resilient iterative projection algorithms
for pCT image reconstruction. Methods: The block-iterative diagonally relaxed
orthogonal projections (DROP) algorithm was used for reconstructing Geant4
Monte Carlo simulated pCT data sets. Two TVS schemes added on to DROP were
investigated; the first carried out the superiorization steps once per cycle
and the second once per block. Simplifications of these schemes, involving the
elimination of the computationally expensive feasibility proximity checking
step of the TVS framework, were also investigated. The modulation transfer
function and contrast discrimination function were used to quantify spatial and
density resolution, respectively. Results: With both TVS schemes, superior
spatial and density resolution was achieved compared to the standard DROP
algorithm. Eliminating the feasibility proximity check improved the image
quality, in particular image noise, in the once-per-block superiorization,
while also halving image reconstruction time. Overall, the greatest image
quality was observed when carrying out the superiorization once-per-block and
eliminating the feasibility proximity check. Conclusions: The low contrast
imaging made possible with TVS holds a promise for its incorporation into our

packages MB (M. Czakon) or MBresolve (A. V. Smirnov and V. A. Smirnov) one may
perform automatically a numerical evaluation of planar tensor Feynman
integrals. Alternatively, one may apply sector decomposition to planar and
non-planar multi-loop epsilon-expanded Feynman integrals with arbitrary tensor
rank. We automatized the preparations of Feynman integrals for an immediate
application of the package sector_decomposition (C. Bogner and S. Weinzierl) so
that one has to give only a proper definition of propagators and numerators.
The efficiency of the two implementations, based on Mellin-Barnes
representations and sector decompositions, is compared. The computational
packages are publicly available.

the strong planet--metallicity correlation. Although more quantitative

  Convolutional LDPC ensemble were introduced by Felstr\""om and Zigangirov and

  The phenomenon of spatial coupling has been observed to hold for general

to undertake highly multiple Student's $t$-tests based on relatively small

main approaches used to control the family-wise error rate and false discovery
rate are still based on the assumption that the tests are independent. The
independence condition is known to be false at the level of the joint
distributions of the test statistics, but that does not necessarily mean, for
the small significance levels involved in highly multiple hypothesis testing,
that the assumption leads to major errors. In this paper, we give conditions
under which the assumption of independence is valid. Specifically, we derive a
strong approximation that closely links the level exceedences of a dependent
``studentized process'' to those of a process of independent random variables.
Via this connection, it can be seen that in high-dimensional, low sample-size
cases, provided the sample size diverges faster than the logarithm of the

constraints than were previously found in the literature. Also, we find that
instabilities of the geometry can appear for certain parameter values at any
point in the geometry, as well in the bulk as close to the horizon. These new
sources of causality violation and instability should be related to CFT
features that do not depend on the UV behavior. They solve a puzzle found
previously concerning unphysical negative values for the shear viscosity that
are not ruled out solely by causality restrictions. We find that, contrary to
previous expectations, causality violation is not always related to positivity
of energy. Furthermore, we compute the bound for the shear viscosity to entropy
density ratio of supersymmetric conformal field theories from d=4 till d=10 -
i.e., up to quartic Lovelock theory -, and find that it behaves smoothly as a
function of d. We propose an approximate formula that nicely fits these values
and has a nice asymptotic behavior when d goes to infinity for any Lovelock
gravity. We discuss in some detail the latter limit. We finally argue that it
is possible to obtain increasingly lower values for the shear viscosity to

lattice XXZ spin model, which is shown to possess a Quantum Group symmetry as a
consequence of a recently found solution of the Zamolodchikov Tetrahedron
Equation. A projection (from three to two space-time dimensions) property of
the solution is used to identify the symmetry of the model at the Mott critical

shown to be a lattice double Chern-Simons theory with coupling constant k=1

characterized by a d-density wave order parameter. We also analyze the behavior

decay searches. In particular, strong bounds are imposed on the mu->eee
branching ratio and on the mu-e conversion probability in muonic gold.
Currently the mu->e gamma decay is under investigation in the MEG experiment

6*10^(-12), which is testable by MEG in the nearest future. The considered

is usually studied in terms of the Fortuin-Kasteleyn (FK) clusters, or their
surrounding loops. In this paper we study a quite different geometrical object:
the spin clusters, defined as connected domains where the spin takes a constant
value. Unlike the usual loops, the domain walls separating different spin
clusters can cross and branch. Moreover, they come in two versions, ""thin"" or
""thick"", depending on whether they separate spin clusters of different or
identical colours. For these reasons their critical behaviour is different
from, and richer than, those of FK clusters. We develop a transfer matrix
technique enabling the formulation and numerical study of spin clusters even
when Q is not an integer. We further identify geometrically the crossing events
which give rise to conformal correlation functions. We study the critical
behaviour both in the bulk, and at a boundary with free, fixed, or mixed
boundary conditions. This leads to infinite series of fundamental critical
exponents, h_{l_1-l_2,2 l_1} in the bulk and h_{1+2(l_1-l_2),1+4 l_1} at the
boundary, valid for 0 <= Q <= 4, that describe the insertion of l_1 thin and
l_2 thick domain walls. We argue that these exponents imply that the domain
walls are `thin' and `thick' also in the continuum limit. A special case of the
bulk exponents is derived analytically from a massless scattering approach.

SFR (minimum 11 solar masses per year, with median SFR approx 61 solar masses
per year based on a Kroupa IMF). The MESS was designed to complement samples of
nearby star-forming galaxies such as the luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs),
and ultraviolet luminous galaxies (UVLGs). Observations using the multiband
imaging photometer (MIPS; 24, 70, and 160{\mu}m channels) on the Spitzer Space
Telescope indicate the MESS galaxies have IR luminosities similar to those of
LIRGs, with an estimated median LTIR ~ 3e11 solar luminosities. The selection
criteria for the MESS suggests they may be less obscured than typical far-IR
selected galaxies with similar estimated SFRs. 20 out of 70 of the MESS objects
detected in the GALEX FUV band also appear to be UV luminous galaxies. We
estimate the SFRs based directly on luminosities to determine the agreement for
these methods in the MESS. We compare to the emission line strength technique,
since effective measurement of dust attenuation plays a central role in these
methods. We apply an image stacking technique to the VLA FIRST survey radio
data to retrieve 1.4 GHz luminosity information for 3/4 of the sample covered
by FIRST including sources too faint, and at too high a redshift, to be

semiconductor cavity, and the interaction of a coherent superposition of two
temporally separated input pulses and the cavity mode leads to a two-photon
Raman transition, which produces a time-bin entangled photon pair through the
biexciton-exciton cascade. We show that the entanglement of the generated state
can be measured using triple coincidence detection, and the degree of
entanglement is quantified as the visibility of the interference. We also
discuss the effect of pure dephasing on entanglement of the generated photon
pair. Pronounced interference visibility values of greater than $1/\sqrt{2}$
are demonstrated in triple coincidence measurement using experimentally
achievable parameters, thus demonstrating that the generated photons are
suitable for applications with Bell's inequality violation and quantum
cryptography.

submillimeter wavelengths of the young O-type protostar W51 North made with the
Submillimeter Array (SMA). We report the presence of a large (of about 8000 AU)
and hot molecular circumstellar disk around this object, which connects the
inner dusty disk with the molecular ring or toroid reported recently, and
confirms the existence of a single bipolar outflow emanating from this object.
The molecular emission from the large disk is observed in layers with the
transitions characterized by high excitation temperatures in their lower energy
states (up to 1512 K) being concentrated closer to the central massive
protostar. The molecular emission from those transitions with low or moderate
excitation temperatures are found in the outermost parts of the disk and
exhibits an inner cavity with an angular size of around 0.7$''$. We modeled all
lines with a Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) synthetic spectra. A detail
study of the kinematics of the molecular gas together with a LTE model of a
circumstellar disk shows that the innermost parts of the disk are also
Keplerian plus a contracting velocity. The emission of the HCOCH$_2$OH reveals
the possible presence of a warm ``companion'' located to the northeast of the
disk, however its nature is unclear. The emission of the SO and SO$_2$ is
observed in the circumstellar disk as well as in the outflow. We suggest that
the massive protostar W51 North appears to be in a phase before the presence of
a Hypercompact or an Ultracompact HII (HC/UCHII) region, and propose a possible
sequence on the formation of the massive stars.

comparing the age of the stars to the crossing time of nearby stellar
agglomerates. We find that a satisfactory separation can be made where this
ratio equals unity. Stellar agglomerates for which the age of the stars exceeds
the crossing time are bound, and are referred to as star clusters.
Alternatively, those for which the crossing time exceeds the stellar age are
unbound and are referred to as associations. This definition is useful whenever
reliable measurements for the mass, radius and age are available.

detectors because they will facilitate tests of strong gravity and probe the
spacetime around rotating compact objects. In the last few years of such
inspirals, the total phase is in the millions of radians and details of the
waveforms are sensitive to small perturbations. We show that one potentially
detectable perturbation is the presence of a second supermassive black hole
within a few tenths of a parsec. The acceleration produced by the perturber on
the extreme mass-ratio system produces a steady drift that causes the waveform
to deviate systematically from that of an isolated system. If the perturber is
a few tenths of a parsec from the extreme-mass ratio system (plausible in as
many as a few percent of cases) higher derivatives of motion might also be
detectable. In that case, the mass and distance of the perturber can be derived
independently, which would allow a new probe of merger dynamics.

increase at sub-solar metallicities where for certain molecules they may reach
-2.0 dex. The 3D-1D abundance differences show a significant dependence on the
