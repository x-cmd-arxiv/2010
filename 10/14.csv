percent of all core-collapse SNe, and the current sample of well observed SNe
IIn is small. Here, we study the four SNe IIn observed by the Caltech
Core-Collapse Project (CCCP). The CCCP SN sample is unbiased to the extent that
object selection was not influenced by target SN properties. Therefore, these
events are representative of the observed population of SNe IIn. We find that a
narrow P-Cygni profile in the hydrogen Balmer lines appears to be a ubiquitous
feature of SNe IIn. Our light curves show a relatively long rise time (>20
days) followed by a slow decline stage (0.01 to 0.15 mag/day), and a typical
V-band peak magnitude of M_V=-18.4 +/- 1.0 mag. We measure the progenitor star
wind velocities (600 - 1400 km/s) for the SNe in our sample and derive
pre-explosion mass loss rates (0.026 - 0.12 solar masses per year). We compile
similar data for SNe IIn from the literature, and discuss our results in the
context of this larger sample. Our results indicate that typical SNe IIn arise
from progenitor stars that undergo LBV-like mass-loss shortly before they
explode.

multi-cell OFDMA network. The problem has a non-convex combinatorial structure
and is known to be NP hard. Due to the inherent complexity of implementing the
optimal solution, firstly, we derive an upper and lower bound to the optimal
average network throughput. Moreover, we investigate the performance of a near
optimal single cell resource allocation scheme in the presence of ICI which
leads to another easily computable lower bound. We then develop a centralized
sub-optimal scheme that is composed of a geometric programming based power
control phase in conjunction with an iterative subcarrier allocation phase.
Although, the scheme is computationally complex, it provides an effective
benchmark for low complexity schemes even without the power control phase.
Finally, we propose less complex centralized and distributed schemes that are
well-suited for practical scenarios. The computational complexity of all
schemes is analyzed and performance is compared through simulations. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed low complexity schemes can achieve
comparable performance to the centralized sub-optimal scheme in various
scenarios. Moreover, comparisons with the upper and lower bounds provide
insight on the performance gap between the proposed schemes and the optimal
solution.

periodic oscillations and strong localized singularities. In particular, we
consider the Schr\""odinger equation \[ H_\epsilon \psi := (-\partial_x^2 +
V_0(x) + q(x,x/\epsilon)) \psi = k^2 \psi, \] for $k\in\RR$ and $\epsilon <<
1$. Here, $q(.,y+1)=q(.,y)$, has mean zero and $|V_0(x)+q(x,.)|$ goes to zero
as $|x|$ goes to infinity. The distorted plane waves of $H_\epsilon$ are
solutions of the form: $e^{\pm ikx}+u^s_\pm(x;k)$, $u^s_\pm$ outgoing as $|x|$
goes to infinity. We derive their $\epsilon$ small asymptotic behavior, from
which the asymptotic behavior of scattering quantities such as the transmission
coefficient, $t^\epsilon (k)$, follow.
  Let $t_0^{hom}(k)$ denote the homogenized transmission coefficient associated
with the average potential $V_0$. If the potential is smooth, then classical
homogenization theory gives asymptotic expansions of, for example, distorted
plane waves, and transmission and reflection coefficients. Singularities of
$V_0$ or discontinuities of $q_\epsilon $, that our theory admits, are
""interfaces"" across which a solution must satisfy interface conditions
(continuity or jump conditions). To satisfy these conditions it is necessary to
introduce interface correctors, which are highly oscillatory in $\epsilon$.
  A consequence of our main results is that $t^\epsilon (k)-t_0^{hom}(k)$, the
error in the homogenized transmission coefficient is (i) $O(\epsilon ^2)$ if
$q_\epsilon $ is continuous and (ii) $O(\epsilon)$ if $q_\epsilon $ has
discontinuities. Moreover, in the discontinuous case the correctors are highly
oscillatory in $\epsilon$, so that a first order corrector is not well-defined.
The analysis is based on a (pre-conditioned) Lippman-Schwinger equation,
introduced in [SIAM J. Mult. Mod. Sim. (3), 3 (2005), pp. 477--521].

solar mass, star with a luminosity of 8\pm3x10^4 solar luminosity. The inferred
mass, effective temperature of the UV source and the ionization rate are
compatible with a young O9-B0 star. The ionized features D1 and D2 are
considered to be ionized by UV radiation collimated by an accretion disk. We
consider that the central massive star photoevaporates its circumstellar disk
on a timescale of 3x10^4 years giving a mass flux ~3x10^{-5} solar mass per yr
and producing the ionized material in D1 and D2 expanding in an inhomogeneous
medium. The ionized gas kinematics, as traced by the [Ne II] emission, is
difficult to interpret, but it could be explained by the interaction of a
bipolar jet with surrounding gas along with what appears to to be a conical
wall of lower velocity gas. The other HII regions, Sgr A East A-C, have
morphologies and kinematics that more closely resemble cometary flows seen in
other compact HII regions, where gas moves along a paraboloidal surface formed

form-function association tendencies exist, gestures with a particular function

fulfil different functions. Reconsidering these results and other research on

called Connected Sum at Infinity, or CSI for short. A driving ambition has been
to make the geometry behind the well definition and basic properties of CSI as
clear and elementary as possible. CSI then yields a very natural and elementary
proof of a remarkable theorem of J. C. Cantrell and J. R. Stallings. It asserts
unknotting of proper embeddings of euclidean (m-1)-space in euclidean m-space
with m not equal to 3, for all three classical manifold categories:
topological, piecewise linear, and differentiable. It is one of the few major
theorems whose statement and proof can be the same for all three categories. We
give it the acronym HLT, which is short for Hyperplane Linearization Theorem.
The topological version of the HLT immediately implies B. Mazur's topological
Schoenflies theorem. We can thus claim that the Cantrell-Stallings theorem, as
we present it, is an enhancement of the topological Schoenflies theorem that

codimension 1 hyperplane embeddings in eucldiean m-space for m not equal to 3.
Namely, they are classified by countable simplicial trees with one edge for

direct information of the nuclear interaction, correlations between atmospheric
families and burst (hadron component of air-showers) accompanied to air-showers
are more sensitive to the mechanism of the the cosmic-ray interactions. The
burst size dependence of the family energy is compared with those of
simulations. It is found that the family energy accompanied by the air-showers
with the larger burst-size is systematically smaller than that expected in the

changing the chemical composition of primary cosmic-rays and this indicates
that the x-distribution of secondary particles in cosmic-ray interactions
becomes much steeper than that assumed in the simulation models.

classical infinite dimensional fluid algebra satisfies an additional identity
related to the Jacobi identity for the lie bracket of vector fields. In part II

developed version of this theory would be a coherence between various levels of

energy budgets in the interstellar and intergalactic medium, and star formation
rate indicators. The low observed escape fractions of ionizing radiation have
not been adequately explained, and there is evidence that some starbursts have
high escape fractions. We examine the spectral energy distributions of a sample
of local star-forming galaxies, containing thirteen local starburst galaxies
and ten of their ordinary star-forming counterparts, to determine if there
exist significant differences in the fate of ionizing radiation in these
galaxies. We find that the galaxy-to-galaxy variations in the SEDs is much
larger than any systematic differences between starbursts and non-starbursts.
For example, we find no significant differences in the total absorption of
ionizing radiation by dust, traced by the 24um, 70um, and 160um MIPS bands of
the Spitzer Space Telescope, although the dust in starburst galaxies appears to
be hotter than that of non-starburst galaxies. We also observe no excess
ultraviolet flux in the GALEX bands that could indicate a high escape fraction
of ionizing photons in starburst galaxies. The small H-alpha fractions of the
diffuse, warm ionized medium in starburst galaxies are apparently due to
temporarily boosted H-alpha luminosity within the star-forming regions
themselves, with an independent, constant WIM luminosity. This independence of
the WIM and starburst luminosities contrasts with WIM behavior in non-starburst
galaxies and underscores our poor understanding of radiation transfer in both
ordinary and starburst galaxies.

confirm pure edge chirality. Here, we perform confocal Raman spectroscopy on
hexagonal holes obtained after the anisotropic etching of prepatterned pits
using carbothermal decomposition of SiO2. The boundaries of the hexagonal holes
are aligned along the zigzag crystallographic direction and leave hardly any
signature in the Raman map indicating unprecedented purity of the edge
chirality. This work offers the first opportunity to experimentally confirm the
validity of the Raman theory for graphene edges.

number of parameters p is comparable to or larger than the sample size n. Since
it is usually impossible to obtain consistent procedures unless
$p/n\rightarrow0$, a line of recent work has studied models with various types
of low-dimensional structure, including sparse vectors, sparse and structured
matrices, low-rank matrices and combinations thereof. In such settings, a
general approach to estimation is to solve a regularized optimization problem,
which combines a loss function measuring how well the model fits the data with
some regularization function that encourages the assumed structure. This paper
provides a unified framework for establishing consistency and convergence rates
for such regularized M-estimators under high-dimensional scaling. We state one
main theorem and show how it can be used to re-derive some existing results,
and also to obtain a number of new results on consistency and convergence
rates, in both $\ell_2$-error and related norms. Our analysis also identifies
two key properties of loss and regularization functions, referred to as
restricted strong convexity and decomposability, that ensure corresponding
regularized M-estimators have fast convergence rates and which are optimal in
many well-studied cases.

variety of applications such as image segmentation, stereo, image stitching and

defined on a graph are known to exhibit metrication artefacts in the solution.
Therefore, a recent trend has been to instead employ a spatially continuous
maximum flow (or the dual min-cut problem) in these same applications to
produce solutions with no metrication errors. However, known fast continuous
max-flow algorithms have no stopping criteria or have not been proved to
converge. In this work, we revisit the continuous max-flow problem and show
that the analogous discrete formulation is different from the classical

technique to this combinatorial continuous max-flow CCMF problem to find a
null-divergence solution that exhibits no metrication artefacts and may be
solved exactly by a fast, efficient algorithm with provable convergence.

originated can be measured. Some authors who have studied this problem have
come to the conclusion that it is not possible that terrestrial life originated
here and that, in reality, life originated giga-years ago, before the solar
system existed. If we accept this conclusion there is no other option than to
admit that panspermia is something viable.The goal of this study is to propose
a viable hypothesis for the transport of SLF from one planetary system to
another. During the formation period of a planetary system giant planets can
eject planets the size of the Earth, or larger, turning them into free-floating
planets in interstellar space. These free-floating planets have also been
called free floaters. If a free floater, which has developed life, enters a
lifeless planetary system, it can seed the worlds of this system with SLF
dragged by the stellar wind from one planet to another or by great impacts on
the free planet. To support this hypothesis, I calculate the probability that
one free floater reaches the planets zone of a planetary system, and also it
was calculated the time it remains within the planetary zone in order to see if
there is enough time to seed the host system.The probability of a free floater
in the galaxy, within the region of the Sun, entering the planet zone of a
system is 2.8x10-4, i.e., that {\sim}3 of 10,000 free planets manage to enter
some planetary system. At the galactocentric distance from the Sun I calculated
that there are 21,495 free floaters floating around the galactic center. Hence,
6 free-floating planets manage to enter in planetary systems every galaxy
rotation. Since the galaxy has rotated 54 times since its formation, then,
{\sim} 324 free floaters have entered some planetary system at the
galactocentric distance of the Sun.

easy calculation of useful performance metrics like sum rate and symbol error

KPD 1946+4340, a short-period binary system that consists of an sdB and a white
dwarf. In the light curve, eclipses are clearly seen, with the deepest
occurring when the compact white dwarf crosses the disc of the sdB (0.4%) and
the more shallow ones (0.1%) when the sdB eclipses the white dwarf. As
expected, the sdB is deformed by the gravitational field of the white dwarf,
which produces an ellipsoidal modulation of the light curve. Spectacularly, a
very strong Doppler beaming (aka Doppler boosting) effect is also clearly
evident at the 0.1% level. This originates from the sdB's orbital velocity,
which we measure to be 164.0\pm1.9 km/s from supporting spectroscopy. We
present light curve models that account for all these effects, as well as
gravitational lensing. We derive system parameters and uncertainties from the
light curve using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations. Adopting a theoretical
white dwarf mass-radius relation, the mass of the subdwarf is found to be
0.47\pm0.03 Msun and the mass of the white dwarf 0.59\pm0.02 Msun. The
effective temperature of the white dwarf is 15 900\pm300K. With a spectroscopic
effective temperature of Teff = 34 730\pm250K and a surface gravity of log g =
5.43\pm0.04, the sdB is in a shell He burning stage. The detection of Doppler
beaming in Kepler light curves potentially allows one to measure radial
velocities without the need of spectroscopic data. For the first time, a
photometrically observed Doppler beaming amplitude is compared to a
spectroscopically established value. The sdB's radial velocity amplitude
derived from the photometry 168\pm4 km/s is in perfect agreement with the
spectroscopic value. After subtracting our best model for the orbital effects,
we searched the residuals for stellar oscillations but did not find any

escape velocity at such a radius. The preferred solutions correspond to a
spherical to prolate Milky Way halo, predicting a transversal motion of M31 of
less than 107 km/s and down to values that are close to zero. We conclude that
from present-day measurements, Magellanic Clouds could well be tidal dwarves
expelled from a former merger events occurring in M31.

Survey-II (SDSS-II) SN Survey. Using the broad-band photometry of the SDSS
survey, we are able to reconstruct the SN host-galaxy spectral energy
distributions (SEDs), allowing for a correction for the host-galaxy
contamination in the SN Ia spectra. Comparison of composite spectra constructed
from a subsample of 17 high-quality spectra to those created from a
low-redshift sample with otherwise similar properties shows that the Keck/SDSS
SNe Ia have, on average, extremely similar rest-frame optical spectra but show
a UV flux excess. This observation is confirmed by comparing synthesized
broad-band colors of the individual spectra, showing a difference in mean
colors at the 2.4 - 4.4 sigma level for various UV colors. We further see a
slight difference in the UV spectral shape between SNe with low-mass and
high-mass host galaxies. Additionally, we detect a relationship between the
flux ratio at 2770 and 2900 A and peak luminosity that differs from that
observed at low redshift. We find that changing the UV SED of an SN Ia within
the observed dispersion can change the inferred distance moduli by ~0.1 mag.
This effect only occurs when the data probe the rest-frame UV. We suggest that
this discrepancy could be due to differences in the host-galaxy population of
the two SN samples or to small-sample statistics.

reddening or a change in the intrinsic ionizing continuum flux. We find that 10
of 19 objects previously classified as Seyfert 1.8/1.9s received this

was due to BLR reddening, either by the torus or dust structures in the

evidence to favor one scenario over the other. These findings imply that, in

fraction, dust-to-gas ratio and metallicity are much lower than in the inner
part of M33 or in a typical spiral galaxy. This allows us to probe the impact
of environment on GMC properties by comparing our measurements to previous data
from the inner disk of M33, the Milky Way and other nearby galaxies. The outer
disk clouds roughly fall on the size-linewidth relation defined by
extragalactic GMCs, but are slightly displaced from the luminosity-virial mass
relation in the sense of having high CO luminosity compared to the inferred
virial mass. This implies a different CO-to-H2 conversion factor, which is on
average a factor of two lower than the inner disk and the extragalactic
average. We attribute this to significantly higher measured brightness
temperatures of the outer disk clouds compared to the ancillary sample of GMCs,
which is likely an effect of enhanced radiation levels due to massive star
formation in the vicinity of our target field. Apart from brightness
temperature, the properties we determine for the outer disk GMCs in M33 do not
differ significantly from those of our comparison sample. In particular, the
combined sample of inner and outer disk M33 clouds covers roughly the same
range in size, linewidth, virial mass and CO luminosity than the sample of
Milky Way GMCs. When compared to the inner disk clouds in M33, however, we find
even the brightest outer disk clouds to be smaller than most of their inner
disk counterparts. This may be due to incomplete sampling or a potentially
steeper cloud mass function at larger radii.

processes of decaying pions produced in cosmic ray collisions with gas, and the
inverse Compton scattering of cosmic ray electrons in both the disk and bulge

approximately 1.25 degrees (~175 parsecs) of the Galactic Center, in contrast,
departs from the expectations for by these processes. Instead, we find an
additional component of gamma ray emission that is highly concentrated around
the Galactic Center. The observed morphology of this component is consistent
with that predicted from annihilating dark matter with a cusped (and possibly
adiabatically contracted) halo distribution (density proportional to
r^{-gamma}, with gamma=1.18 to 1.33). The observed spectrum of this component,
which peaks at energies between 1-4 GeV (in E^2 units), can be well fit by a

spectrum (a starburst indicator) and (2) the CO absorption feature at

originating in the CO molecule. We clearly detected the 3.3 micrometer PAH
emission features in five objects and the CO absorption features in 17 objects.
Seyfert 2 galaxies tend to show bluer K-L colors compared with Seyfert 1
galaxies. We interpret the discrepancy as resulting from relative strength of
stellar emission because AGN emission is affected by dust extinction. The 3.3
micrometer PAH emission luminosity (L_3.3PAH) distributions for the Seyfert 1s
and Seyfert 2s are very similar when normalized to the AGN power.
Star-formation rates estimated from L_3.3PAH could be large enough to inflate
the dusty torus by supernova explosion. We find that L_3.3PAH positively
correlates with N-band luminosity with small aperture over a wide AGN
luminosity range, and is independent of physical area we probed. The results
suggest that nuclear region has a concentration of star formation and the star
formation would control AGN activity.

evolution with composition x in (SrRuO3)(1-x)(LaRhO3)(x) of the crystal
structure and electrical and magnetic properties has been studied and is
reported here. As x increases, the octahedral tilt angle gradually increases,
along with the pseudocubic lattice parameter and unit cell volume. Electrical
resistivity measurements reveal a compositionally driven metal to insulator
transition between x = 0.1 and 0.2. Ferromagnetic ordering gives over to glassy
magnetism for x > 0.3 and no magnetic ordering is found above 2 K for x > 0.5.
M_sat and Theta_CW decrease with increasing x and remain constant after x =
0.5. The magnetism appears poised between localized and itinerant behavior, and
becomes more localized with increasing x as evidenced by the evolution of the
Rhodes-Wohlfarth ratio. mu_eff per Ru is equal to the quenched spin-only S
value across the entire solid solution. Comparisons with Sr(1-x)Ca(x)RuO3
reinforce the important role of structural distortions in determining magnetic
ground state. It is suggested that electrical transport and magnetic properties
are not strongly coupled in this system.

provide the full SED of the galactic ISM dust emission with an unprecedented
sensitivity and angular resolution. It will allow a systematic study of the
dust evolution processes that affect the SED. Here we present a versatile
numerical tool, DustEM, that predicts the emission and extinction of dust given
their size distribution and their optical and thermal properties. In order to
model dust evolution, DustEM has been designed to deal with a variety of grain
types, structures and size distributions and to be able to easily include new
dust physics. We use DustEM to model the dust SED and extinction in the diffuse
interstellar medium at high-galactic latitude (DHGL), a natural reference SED.
We present a coherent set of observations for the DHGL SED. The dust components
in our DHGL model are (i) PAHs, (ii) amorphous carbon and (iii) amorphous
silicates. We use amorphous carbon dust, rather than graphite, because it
better explains the observed high abundances of gas-phase carbon in shocked
regions of the interstellar medium. Using the DustEM model, we illustrate how,
in the optically thin limit, the IRAS/Planck HFI (and likewise Spitzer/Herschel
for smaller spatial scales) photometric band ratios of the dust SED can
disentangle the influence of the exciting radiation field intensity and
constrain the abundance of small grains relative to the larger grains. We also
discuss the contributions of the different grain populations to the IRAS,
Planck and Herschel channels. Such information is required to enable a study of
the evolution of dust as well as to systematically extract the dust thermal
emission from CMB data and to analyze the emission in the Planck polarized
channels. The DustEM code described in this paper is publically available.

We selected a relatively diffuse and low excitation region of the

pixel fitting of the 8 to 500 microns SED using the DustEM dust emission model.
We derived maps of the Very Small Grains (VSG) and PAH abundances from the

(AIB) intensity does not trace necessarily the PAH abundance but rather the
product of ""abundance x column density x intensity of the exciting radiation
field"". We show that the spatial structure of PACS70microns map resembles the
shorter wavelengths (e.g. IRAC8microns) maps, because they trace both the
intensity of exciting radiation field and column density. We also show that the
modeled VSG contribution to PACS70microns (PACS160microns) band intensity can
be up to 50% (7%). The interpretation of diffuse emission spectra at these

this preliminary study emphasizes the potential of analyzing the full dust SED

strategy for the interference channel. While the achieved sum rate with IA is
much higher than previously thought possible, the improvement often comes at
the cost of requiring network channel state information at the transmitters.
This can be achieved by explicit feedback, a flexible yet potentially costly
approach that incurs large overhead. In this paper we propose analog feedback
as an alternative to limited feedback or reciprocity based alignment. We show
that the full multiplexing gain observed with perfect channel knowledge is
preserved by analog feedback and that the mean loss in sum rate is bounded by a
constant when signal-to-noise ratio is comparable in both forward and feedback
channels. When signal-to-noise ratios are not quite symmetric, a fraction of
the multiplexing gain is achieved. We consider the overhead of training and
feedback and use this framework to optimize the system's effective throughput.
We present simulation results to demonstrate the performance of IA with analog
feedback, verify our theoretical analysis, and extend our conclusions on
optimal training and feedback length.

have been theoretically motivated as emitters of high-energy cosmic rays.
Recent radio observations have established a populous class of young radio-loud
galaxies with compact ($< 1$ kpc) symmetric jets that are morphologically
similar to large-scale AGNs. We show that these compact AGNs, so-called compact
symmetric objects (CSOs), can accelerate protons up to $10^{20}$ eV at their
hot spots via a Fermi type mechanism on the assumption of efficient
acceleration. The required magnetic field strengths are comparable to those
derived from the minimum energy condition. We further show that the accelerated
protons can escape through the photon fields of the cocoon without significant
energy loss. However, the local number density of powerful CSOs is insufficient
for CSOs to power the entire observed flux of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays,
providing maximally only a few percent. A heavy composition of UHECRs allows
more CSOs to accelerate particles to UHECR energies, but escaping the cocoon is
difficult. We comment on a method that may test CSOs as UHECR sources.

outage probability as well as their robustness and dual problems are
investigated. Compact, closed-form expressions for the optimum allocations and
corresponding system performance are given. The uniform power allocation is
shown to be near optimum in the low outage regime in combination with the
optimum rate allocation. The average rate allocation provides the largest
performance improvement (extra diversity gain), and the average power
allocation offers a modest SNR gain limited by the number of transmit antennas
but does not increase the diversity gain. The dual problems are shown to have
the same solutions as the primal ones. All these allocation strategies are
shown to be robust. The reported results also apply to coded multiuser

2.36. This relation, M = (228 +/- 18) R^{2.36+/-0.04}, allows us to derive
masses for an additional 170 GRS molecular clouds not covered by the UMSB

examine its spatial variations throughout the Galaxy. We find that the
azimuthally averaged Galactic surface density of molecular gas peaks between
Galactocentric radii of 4 and 5 kpc. Although the Perseus arm is not detected
in molecular gas, the Galactic surface density of molecular gas is enhanced
along the positions of the Scutum-Crux and Sagittarius arms. This may indicate
that molecular clouds form in spiral arms and are disrupted in the inter-arm
space. Last, we find that the CO excitation temperature of molecular clouds
decreases away from the Galactic center, suggesting a possible decline in the
star formation rate with Galactocentric radius. There is a marginally
significant enhancement in the CO excitation temperature of molecular clouds at
a Galactocentric radius of about 6 kpc, which in the longitude range of the GRS
corresponds to the Sagittarius arm. This temperature increase could be
associated with massive star formation in the Sagittarius spiral arm.

Various processes such as elastic scattering of the photoelectron on the parent
ion and many-electron correlation affect the quantum phase of the dipole
transition matrix element, the energy dependence of which defines the emission
timing. This qualitatively explains the time delay between photoemission from
the $2s$ and $2p$ sub-shells of Ne as determined experimentally by attosecond
streaking [{\em Science} {\bf 328}, 1658 (2010)]. However, with our extensive
numerical modeling, we were only able to account for less than a half of the

produce such a large time delay and it is the streaking IR field that is most
likely responsible for this effect.

biological oscillators? This question connects with both classical dynamical
systems analyses of entrainment and phase locking and with emerging studies of
stimulation patterns for controlling neural network activity. Here, we focus on
the response of a population of uncoupled, elliptically bursting neurons to a
common pulsatile input. We extend a phase reduction from the literature to
capture inputs of varied strength, leading to a circle map with discontinuities
of various orders. In a combined analytical and numerical approach, we apply
our results to both a normal form model for elliptic bursting and to a
biophysically-based neuron model from the basal ganglia. We find that,
depending on the period and amplitude of inputs, the response can either appear
chaotic (with provably positive Lyaponov exponent for the associated circle
maps), or periodic with a broad range of phase-locked periods. Throughout, we
discuss the critical underlying mechanisms, including slow-passage effects
through Hopf bifurcation, the role and origin of discontinuities, and the
impact of noise

how the Stokes vector (I, Q, U, V) varies with pulse longitude, with special
emphasis on the position angle (PA) swing of the linearly polarized component.
The interpretation of the PA swing in terms of the rotating vector model is
limited by the assumption of an axisymmetric magnetic field and the degeneracy
of the output with respect to the orientation and magnetic geometry of the
pulsar; different combinations of the latter two properties can produce similar
PA swings. This paper introduces Stokes phase portraits as a supplementary
diagnostic tool with which the orientation and magnetic geometry can be
inferred more accurately. The Stokes phase portraits feature unique patterns in
the I-Q, I-U, and Q-U planes, whose shapes depend sensitively on the magnetic
geometry, inclination angle, beam and polarization patterns, and emission
altitude. We construct look-up tables of Stokes phase portraits and PA swings
for pure and current-modified dipole fields, filled core and hollow cone beams,
and two empirical linear polarization models, L/I = \cos \theta_0 and L/I =
\sin \theta_0, where \theta_0 is the colatitude of the emission point. We
compare our look-up tables to the measured phase portraits of 24 pulsars in the
European Pulsar Network online database. We find evidence in 60% of the objects
that the radio emission region may depart significantly from low altitudes,
even when the PA swing is S-shaped and/or the pulse-width-period relation is
well satisfied. On the other hand, the data are explained adequately if the
emission altitude exceeds ~10% of the light cylinder radius. We conclude that
Stokes phase portraits should be analysed concurrently with the PA swing and
pulse profiles in future when interpreting radio pulsar polarization data.

  For singly ionized heavy elements we find eight components covering a
velocity range of $\sim 110$ {\kms}. The \ion{H}{1} structure is expected to
follow some combination of the singly ionized and neutral gas, but the 21cm
absorption profile is considerably different. This may be because of the
different extent and brightness distributions of the radio and optical
background sources, and so the spin temperature derived by comparing the
Ly$\alpha$ and 21cm line strengths has little physical meaning. The neutral and
singly ionized heavy element line profiles also show significant differences,
and so the dominant components in each appear to be physically distinct.
Attempts to use the range of atomic masses to separate thermal and turbulent
components of their Doppler widths were not generally successful. The velocity
structure in all ionization stages up to $+3$, apart from the neutral heavy
elements, is sufficiently complex that it is difficult to separate out the
corresponding velocity components for different ionization levels and determine

state explosion, a major obstacle to the successful application of these
formalisms in modeling real-world scenarios. In order to cope with the
complexity of individual specifications we can apply partition refinement, an
abstraction technique to alleviate the state explosion problem. But this

not offer any guarantees for success. To better understand as to why partition
refinement succeeds in some cases while it fails in others, we conducted an
empirical study on the performance of a partition refinement algorithm for

suitable predictors for the expected effectiveness of partition refinement. It
is the structure, not the size, of a specification that weighs heavier on the

propose automated techniques to analyse service interfaces. A first problem,
called compatibility, aims at determining whether a set of services (two in
this paper) can be composed together and interact with each other as expected.
Another related problem is to check the substitutability of one service with
another. These problems are especially difficult when behavioural descriptions
(i.e., message calls and their ordering) are taken into account in service
interfaces. Interfaces should capture as faithfully as possible the service
behaviour to make their automated analysis possible while not exhibiting
implementation details. In this position paper, we choose Labelled Transition
Systems to specify the behavioural part of service interfaces. In particular,
we show that internal behaviours (tau transitions) are necessary in these
transition systems in order to detect subtle errors that may occur when
composing a set of services together. We also show that tau transitions should
be handled differently in the compatibility and substitutability problem: the
former problem requires to check if the compatibility is preserved every time a
tau transition is traversed in one interface, whereas the latter requires a
precise analysis of tau branchings in order to make the substitution preserve
the properties (e.g., a compatibility notion) which were ensured before
replacement.

where many participants are involved in a same game session and communicate
through a network, they may have an inconsistent view of the virtual world
because of the communication delays across the network. This issue becomes even
more challenging when communicating through a cellular network while executing
the DIA client on a mobile terminal. Consistency maintenance algorithms may be
used to obtain a uniform view of the virtual world. These algorithms are very
complex and hard to program and therefore, the implementation and the future
evolution of the application logic code become difficult. To solve this
problem, we propose an approach where the consistency concerns are handled
separately by a distributed component called a Synchronization Medium, which is
responsible for the communication management as well as the consistency
maintenance. We present the detailed architecture of the Synchronization Medium
and the generic interfaces it offers to DIAs. We evaluate our approach both
qualitatively and quantitatively. We first demonstrate that the Synchronization
Medium is a reusable component through the development of two game
applications, a car racing game and a space war game. A performance evaluation
then shows that the overhead introduced by the Synchronization Medium remains
acceptable.

coexistence in asymmetric local communities and generate unimodal species
abundance distributions indistinguishable from those of symmetric communities.
Multiple modes, however, only arise from asymmetric processes and provide a
strong indication of non-neutral dynamics. Although the exact stationary
distributions of fully asymmetric communities must be calculated numerically,
we derive approximate sampling distributions for the general case and for
nearly neutral communities where symmetry is broken by a single species
distinct from all others in ecological fitness and dispersal ability. In the
latter case, our approximate distributions are fully normalized, and novel
asymptotic expansions of the required hypergeometric functions are provided to
make evaluations tractable for large communities. Employing these results in a
Bayesian analysis may provide a novel statistical test to assess the
consistency of species abundance data with the neutral hypothesis.

simulating time-dependent Stokes flow in the presence of irregular free
surfaces and moving solid boundaries. The method uses an embedded boundary
approach on staggered Cartesian grids, avoiding the need for expensive
remeshing operations, and can be applied to flows in both two and three
dimensions. It uses fully implicit backwards Euler integration to provide
stability and supports spatially varying density and viscosity, while requiring
the solution of just a single sparse, symmetric positive-definite linear system
per time step. By expressing the problem in a variational form, challenging
irregular domains are supported implicitly through the use of natural boundary
conditions. In practice, the discretization requires only centred finite
difference stencils and per-cell volume fractions, and is straightforward to
implement. The variational form further permits generalizations to coupling
other mechanics, all the while reducing to a sparse symmetric positive definite
matrix. We demonstrate consistent first order convergence of velocity in L1 and
Linf norms on a range of analytical test cases in two dimensions. Furthermore,
we apply our method as part of a simple Navier-Stokes solver to illustrate that
it can reproduce the characteristic jet buckling phenomenon of Newtonian
liquids at moderate viscosities, in both two and three dimensions.

the model independent implications of these data for the propagation time
scales of cosmic rays in the Galaxy. Considering radioactive nuclei, using
decaying charge to decayed charge ratios -- the only directly relevant data
available at relativistic energies -- we show that a rigidity independent
residence time is consistent with observations. The data for all nuclei can be
described by f_{s,i}=(t_i/100 Myr)^{0.7}, where f_{s,i} is the suppression of
the flux due to decay and t_i is the observer frame lifetime for nucleus specie
i. Considering positron measurements, we argue that the positron flux is
consistent with a secondary origin. Comparing the positron data with
radioactive nuclei at the same energy range, we derive an upper bound on the
mean electromagnetic energy density traversed by the positrons, \bar U_T<1.25
eV/cm^3 at a rigidity of R=40 GV. Charge ratio measurements within easy reach
of the AMS-02 experiment, most notably a determination of the Cl/Ar ratio

it disagrees with the numerical results in reproducing the minor-to-major axis

axis distribution appears to be the opposite to what is found in many previous
numerical studies, where low-mass halos are preferentially more spherical than
high-mass halos. In our model, the high-mass halos are predicted to be more
spherical, consistent with results based on a more recent and elaborate halo

macroscopic variables, instead of the distribution of all the allele
frequencies that influence the trait. These macroscopic variables are the
expectations of: the trait mean and its square, the genetic variance, and of a
measure of heterozygosity, and are derived from a generating function that is
in turn derived by maximizing an entropy measure. These four macroscopics are
enough to accurately describe the dynamics of the trait mean and of its genetic
variance (and in principle of any other quantity). Unlike previous approaches
that were based on an infinite series of moments or cumulants, which had to be
truncated arbitrarily, our calculations provide a well-defined approximation
procedure. We apply the framework to abrupt and gradual changes in the optimum,
as well as to changes in the strength of stabilizing selection. Our
approximations are surprisingly accurate, even for systems with as few as 5
loci. We find that when the effects of drift are included, the expected genetic
variance is hardly altered by directional selection, even though it fluctuates
in any particular instance. We also find hysteresis, showing that even after
averaging over the microscopic variables, the macroscopic trajectories retain a
memory of the underlying genetic states.

electron in an external EM field based on the requirement of total momentum
conservation, when its EM radiation is prohibited. It has been shown that the
modified expression for the energy levels of hydrogenic atoms within such a
pure bound field theory (PBFT) provides the same gross and fine structure of
energy levels like the standard theory. Now we apply the PBFT to the analysis
of hyperfine interactions and show the appearance of some important corrections
to the energy levels (the 1S-2S interval and hyperfine spin-spin splitting in
positronium, 1S and 2S-2P Lamb shift in hydrogen), which remedies considerably
the discrepancy between theoretical predictions and experimental results. In
particular, the corrected 1S-2S interval and the spin-spin splitting in
positronium practically eliminate the available up to date deviation between
theoretical and experimental data. The re-estimated classic 2S-2P Lamb shift as
well as ground state Lamb shift in the hydrogen atom lead to the proton charge
radius rp=0.837(8) fm (from 2S-2P Lamb shift), and rp=0.840(24) fm (from 1S
Lamb shift), which corresponds to the latest estimation of proton size via the
measurement of 2S-2P Lamb shift in muonic hydrogen, i.e. rp=0.84184(67) fm. We
also emphasize the universal character of PBFT, which is applicable to heavy
atoms, too, and analyze 2S-2P interval in Li-like uranium. We show that the
corrections we introduced provide a better correspondence between the
calculated and experimental data than that furnished by the standard approach.
The results obtained support our principal idea of the enhancement of the bound
EM field in the absence of EM radiation for quantum bound systems.

the possible locations of high-energy emission sites. We have simulated two
jets with different injection power in order to give a hint on the minimum
power required for the jet to escape the system and become visible in larger
scales. In the setup, we include a massive star wind filling the grid through
which the jet evolves. We show that jets should have powers of the order of
$10^{37}\rm{erg/s}$ or more in order not to be destroyed by the stellar wind.
The jet-wind interaction results in regions in which high energy emission could
be produced. These results imply the possible existence of a population of
X-ray binaries not detected in the radio band due to jet disruption inside the

put under scrutiny, {\gamma}-Fe2O3 or maghemite, have diameter of 6.7 nm and
8.3 nm and narrow polydispersity. The co-assembly is driven by i) the
electrostatic interactions between the polymers and the particles, and by ii)
the presence of an externally applied magnetic field. The rods are
characterized by large anisotropy factors, with diameter 200 nm and length
comprised between 1 and 100 {\mu}m. In the present work, we provide for the
first time the morphology diagram for the rods as a function of ionic strength
and concentration. We show the existence of a critical nanoparticle
concentration and of a critical ionic strength beyond which the rods do not
form. In the intermediate regimes, only tortuous and branched aggregates are
detected. At higher concentrations and lower ionic strengths, linear and stiff
rods with superparamagnetic properties are produced. Based on these data, a
mechanism for the rod formation is proposed. The mechanism proceeds in two
steps : the formation and growth of spherical clusters of particles, and the
alignment of the clusters induced by the magnetic dipolar interactions. As far
as the kinetics of these processes is concerned, the clusters growth and their
alignment occur concomitantly, leading to a continuous accretion of particles
or small clusters, and a welding of the rodlike structure.

large fraction of non-thermal continuum emission (particularly during powerful
flares), which makes understanding their physics an important aspect of studies
of blazars characterised by profound flaring activity arising from extremely
compact regions. Imaging and polarimetry of radio emission on milliarcsecond
scales provided by very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) offers a range of
possibilities for studying ultra-compact regions in relativistic jets and
relating them to main manifestations of the blazar activity in AGN.
Simultaneous monitoring of optical/high energy variability and evolution of

relation between acceleration and propagation of relativistic flows and
non-thermal continuum generation in blazars. These effects are reviewed and

is based on the recently developed Bethe-Ansatz local density approximation

is capable of describing both Luttinger liquid and Mott-insulator correlations.
The BALDA calculated values for the static linear polarizability are compared
with those obtained by numerically accurate methods, such as exact (Lanczos)
diagonalization and the density matrix renormalization group, over a broad
range of parameters. In general BALDA linear polarizabilities are in good
agreement with the exact results. The response of the exact exchange and
correlation potential is found to point in the same direction of the perturbing
potential. This is well reproduced by the BALDA approach, although the fine
details depend on the specific parameterization for the local approximation.
Finally we provide a numerical proof for the non-locality of the exact exchange
and correlation functional.

conductivity of SiNT is only about 33% of that of SiNW at room temperature. The
spatial distribution of vibrational energy reveals that localization modes are
concentrated on the inner and outer surfaces of SiNTs. The enhanced

deviation does not result from crossover to the hopping conductivity, which
occurs at $\sigma<10^{-2}$, but from the Pippard ineffectiveness.

over a converged turbulent state before turning self-gravity on is well-fitted
with a lognormal distribution. However, after turning self-gravity on, the
volume fractions of density PDFs at a high density tail, compared with the
lognormal distribution, increase as time goes on. In order to see the effect of
self-gravity on core formation rates, we compared the core formation rate per
free-fall time (CFR$_{\rm ff}$) from the theory based on the lognormal
distribution and the one from our numerical experiment. For our fiducial value
of a critical density, 100, normalised with an initial value, the latter
CFR$_{\rm ff}$ is about 30 times larger the former one. Therefore, self-gravity
plays an important role in significantly increasing CFR$_{\rm ff}$. This result
implies that core (star) formation rates or core (stellar) mass functions
predicted from theories based on the lognormal density PDF need some
modifications. Our result of the increased volume fraction of density PDFs
after turning self-gravity on is consistent with power-law like tails commonly
observed at higher ends of visual extinction PDFs of active star-forming

A ""candidate surface cover"" is an abstract branch datum, a priori not coming

Hurwitz problem asks which candidate surface covers are realizable by branched
covers. It is now known that all candidate covers are realizable when the
candidate covered surface has positive genus, but not all are when it is the
2-sphere. However a long-standing conjecture asserts that candidate covers with
prime degree are realizable. To a candidate surface cover one can associate one
Y -> X between 2-orbifolds, and in a previous paper we have completely analyzed
the candidate surface covers such that either X is bad, spherical, or
Euclidean, or both X and Y are rigid hyperbolic orbifolds, thus also providing
strong supporting evidence for the prime-degree conjecture. In this paper,
using a variety of different techniques, we continue this analysis, carrying it
out completely for the case where X is hyperbolic and rigid and Y has a
2-dimensional Teichmueller space. We find many more realizable and

of a dyadic tree in which flows a Newtonian fluid. Our optimization problem
consists in finding the shape of the tree that minimizes the viscous energy
dissipated by the fluid with a constrained volume, under the assumption that
the total flow of the fluid is conserved throughout the structure. These
hypotheses model situations where a fluid is transported from a source towards
a 3D domain into which the transport network also spans. Such situations could
be encountered in organs like for instance the lungs and the vascular networks.
Two fluid regimes are studied: (i) low flow regime (Poiseuille) in trees with
an arbitrary number of generations using a matricial approach and (ii) non
linear flow regime (Navier-Stokes, moderate regime with a Reynolds number 100)
in trees of two generations using shape derivatives in an augmented Lagrangian
algorithm coupled with a 2D/3D finite elements code to solve Navier-Stokes
equations. It relies on the study of a finite dimensional optimization problem
in the case (i) and on a standard shape optimization problem in the case (ii).
We show that the behaviours of both regimes are very similar and that the
optimal shape is highly dependent on the boundary conditions of the fluid
applied at the leaves of the tree.

significantly smaller than that expected from a simple extrapolation of the AGN

evidence for an anti-correlation between the variability amplitude and L(2-10

physical systems involving self-organising solid or liquid films at solid
surfaces. The films may undergo a structuring process by dewetting,
evaporation/condensation or epitaxial growth, respectively. We highlight
similarities and differences of the three systems based on the observation that
in certain limits all of them may be described using models of similar form,
i.e., time evolution equations for the film thickness profile. Those equations
represent gradient dynamics characterized by mobility functions and an
underlying energy functional.
  Two basic steps of mathematical analysis are used to compare the different
system. First, we discuss the linear stability of homogeneous steady states,
i.e., flat films; and second the systematics of non-trivial steady states,
i.e., drop/hole states for dewetting films and quantum dot states in epitaxial
growth, respectively. Our aim is to illustrate that the underlying solution
structure might be very complex as in the case of epitaxial growth but can be
better understood when comparing to the much simpler results for the dewetting
liquid film. We furthermore show that the numerical continuation techniques
employed can shed some light on this structure in a more convenient way than
time-stepping methods.
  Finally we discuss that the usage of the employed general formulation does
not only relate seemingly not related physical systems mathematically, but does
as well allow to discuss model extensions in a more unified way.

representations have been proposed. The purpose is to investigate on the
properties of the series through graph theoretical tools recently developed in
the core of the celebrated complex network theory. Among some other methods,
the so-called visibility algorithm has received much attention, since it has
been shown that series correlations are captured by the algorithm and
translated in the associated graph, opening the possibility of building
fruitful connections between time series analysis, nonlinear dynamics, and
graph theory. Here we use the horizontal visibility algorithm to characterize
and distinguish between correlated stochastic, uncorrelated and chaotic
processes. We show that in every case the series maps into a graph with
exponential degree distribution P (k) ~ exp(-{\lambda}k), where the value of
{\lambda} characterizes the specific process. The frontier between chaotic and
correlated stochastic processes, {\lambda} = ln(3/2), can be calculated
exactly, and some other analytical developments confirm the results provided by
extensive numerical simulations and (short) experimental time series.

measure [alpha/Fe] from SDSS/SEGUE spectra (with S/N > 20/1) to a precision of
better than 0.1 dex, for stars with atmospheric parameters in the range Teff =

[alpha/Fe] = [-0.1, +0.6]. For stars with [Fe/H] < -1.4, our method requires
spectra with slightly higher signal-to-noise to achieve this precision (S/N >
25/1). Over the full temperature range considered, the lowest metallicity star
for which a confident estimate of [alpha/Fe] can be obtained from our approach
is [Fe/H] ~ -2.5; preliminary tests indicate that a metallicity limit as low as
[Fe/H] ~ -3.0 may apply to cooler stars. As a further validation of this
approach, weighted averages of [alpha/Fe] obtained for SEGUE spectra of likely
member stars of Galactic globular clusters (M15, M13, and M71) and open
clusters (NGC 2420, M67, and NGC 6791) exhibit good agreement with the values

evolution onto the main sequence, properties on the main sequence, and
subsequent evolution. 5 $M_\odot$ stars have provided a wealth of information
about the binary properties fairly massive stars. The combination of cool
evolved primaries and hot secondaries in Cepheids (geriatric B stars) have
yielded detailed information about the distribution of mass ratios. and have
also provided a surprisingly high fraction of triple systems. Ground-based
radial velocity orbits combined with satellite data from Hubble, FUSE, IUE, and
Chandra are needed to provide full information about the systems, including the
masses. As a recent example, X-ray observations can identify low mass
companions which are young enough to be physical companions. Typically binary

appears to be strongly correlated with the distribution of molecular gas along
the Galactic ridge. Although it is not yet entirely clear whether the origin of
the TeV photons is due to hadronic or leptonic interactions, the tight
correlation of the intensity distribution with the molecular gas strongly
points to a pionic-decay process involving relativistic protons. But the
spectrum of the TeV radiation---a power law with index $\alpha\approx
-2.3$---cannot be accommodated easily with the much steeper distribution of
cosmic rays seen at Earth. In earlier work, we examined the possible sources of
these relativistic protons and concluded that neither the supermassive black
hole Sagittarius A* (identified with the HESS source J1745-290), nor several
pulsar wind nebulae dispersed along the Galactic plane, could produce a TeV
emission profile morphologically similar to that seen by HESS. We concluded
from this earlier study that only relativistic protons accelerated throughout
the inter-cloud medium could account for the observed diffuse TeV emission from
this region. In this paper, we develop a model for diffusive proton
acceleration driven by a turbulent Alfv\'enic magnetic field present throughout
the gaseous medium. Though circumstantial, this appears to be the first
evidence that at least some cosmic rays are accelerated diffusively within the
inner $\sim300$ pc of the Galaxy.

This red giant (T_eff = 4885 K and log g = 2.65) is a fast rotator with a
projected rotational velocity of 8.4 km/s and an unusually high lithium
abundance of A(Li) = 3.30 dex. Although the lack of a measured parallax
precludes knowing the exact evolutionary phase, an isochrone-derived estimate
of its luminosity places the star on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram in a
location that is not consistent with either the red bump on the first ascent of
the red giant branch or with the second ascent on the asymptotic giant branch,
the two evolutionary stages where lithium-rich giant stars tend to cluster.
Thus, even among the already unusual group of lithium-rich giant stars,
G0928+73.2600 is peculiar. Using 12C/13C as a tracer for mixing---more mixing
leads to lower 12C/13C---we find 12C/13C = 28, which is near the expected value
for standard first dredge-up mixing. We can therefore conclude that ""extra""
deep mixing has not occurred. Regardless of the ambiguity of the evolutionary
stage, the extremely large lithium abundance and the rotational velocity of
this star are unusual, and we speculate that G0928+73.2600 has been enriched in
both lithium and angular momentum from a sub-stellar companion.

is to design channel sensing-based protocol in multi secondary users (SUs)
network. Quality of Service (QoS) requirements for SUs have significant
implications on this protocol design. In this paper, we propose a new method to
find joint policies for SUs which not only guarantees QoS requirements but also
maximizes network throughput. We use Decentralized Partially Observable Markov
Decision Process (Dec-POMDP) to formulate interactions between SUs. Meanwhile,
a tractable approach for Dec-POMDP is utilized to extract sub-optimum joint
policies for large horizons. Among these policies, the joint policy which
guarantees QoS requirements is selected as the joint sensing strategy for SUs.
To show the efficiency of the proposed method, we consider two SUs trying to
access two-channel primary users (PUs) network modeled by discrete Markov
chains. Simulations demonstrate three interesting findings: 1- Optimum joint
policies for large horizons can be obtained using the proposed method. 2- There
exists a joint policy for the assumed QoS constraints. 3- Our method
outperforms other related works in terms of network throughput.

states for teleportation, called the quantum teleportation capability, and then
investigate its restricted shareability in multi-party quantum systems. In this
work, we verify that the quantum teleportation capability has a monogamous
property in its shareability for arbitrary three-qutrit pure states by
employing the monogamy inequality in terms of the negativity.
