as a function of a center-of-mass energy E of colliding nuclei (below and above
the Coulomb barrier) for non-resonant fusion reactions. For any given reaction,
the S(E)-model contains four parameters [two of which approximate the barrier
potential, U(r)]. They are easily interpolated along many reactions involving
isotopes of the same elements; they give accurate practical expressions for
S(E) with only several input parameters for many reactions. The model
reproduces the suppression of S(E) at low energies (of astrophysical
importance) due to the shape of the low-r wing of U(r). The model can be used
to reconstruct U(r) from computed or measured S(E). For illustration, we
parameterize our recent calculations of S(E) (using the Sao Paulo potential and
the barrier penetration formalism) for 946 reactions involving stable and
unstable isotopes of C, O, Ne, and Mg (with 9 parameters for all reactions
involving many isotopes of the same elements, e.g., C+O). In addition, we
analyze astrophysically important 12C+12C reaction, compare theoretical models
with experimental data, and discuss the problem of interpolating reliably known
S(E) values to low energies (E <= 2-3 MeV).

a passive player into a game (a player with a singleton set of pure

phenomenon of post-selection suppression of leading parton spectrum (effective

that $2 \to 2$ mechanism dominates in the inclusive leading pion production in
d-Au collisions and explain that the post-selection naturally explains both the
magnitude of the suppression of the forward pion production in d-Au collisions
and the pattern of the forward - central correlations. At the same time this
pattern of correlations rules out $2\to 1$ mechanism as the main source of the
inclusive leading pion yield. It is demonstrated that the mechanism of the
double parton interactions gives an important contribution to the production of
two leading pions in $pp$ scattering opening a new way to study correlations of
leading quarks in the nucleon. The same mechanism is enhanced in $dAu \to

the composition of both, a rigid motion. The volume is measured by the
d-dimensional Hausdorff measure, which coincides with the Lebesgue measure for
Lebesgue measurable sets. We bound the volume of the symmetric difference of A
and f(A) in terms of the (d-1)-dimensional volume of the boundary of A and the
maximal distance of a boundary point to its image under f. The boundary is
measured by the (d-1)-dimensional Hausdorff measure, which matches the surface
area for sufficiently nice sets. In the case of translations, our bound is
sharp. In the case of rotations, we get a sharp bound under the assumption that
the boundary is sufficiently nice. The motivation to study these bounds comes
from shape matching. For two shapes A and B in IR^d and a class of
transformations, the matching problem asks for a transformation f such that
f(A) and B match optimally. The quality of the match is measured by some
similarity measure, for instance the volume of overlap. Let A and B be bounded
subsets of IR^d, and let F be the function that maps a rigid motion r to the
volume of overlap of r(A) and B. Maximizing this function is a shape matching
problem, and knowing that F is Lipschitz continuous helps to solve it. We apply
our results to bound the difference |F(r) - F(s)| for rigid motions r,s that
are close, implying that F is Lipschitz continuous for many metrics on the
space of rigid motions. Depending on the metric, also a Lipschitz constant can
be deduced from the bound.

distribution are due to absorption of the 7-mm free-free continuum emission

molecular material, causing a central dip in the molecular line distributions.

including the possibility that its atmospheric opacity is dominated by a
variety of non- equilibrium chemical products. We also validate our
transmission code by demonstrating close agreement with analytic models that
use only Rayleigh scattering or water vapor opacity. We find broad disagreement
with radius variations predicted by another published model. For GJ 436b, the
relative coolness of the planet's atmosphere, along with its implied high
metallicity, may make it dissimilar in character compared to ""hot Jupiters.""
Some recent observational and modeling efforts suggest low relative abundances
of H2O and CH4 present in GJ 436b's atmosphere, compared to calculations from
equilibrium chemistry. We include these characteristics in our models and
examine the effects of absorption from methane-derived higher order
hydrocarbons. Significant absorption from HCN and C2H2 are found throughout the
infrared, while C2H4 and C2H6 are less easily seen. We perform detailed
simulations of JWST observations, including all likely noise sources, and find
that we will be able to constrain chemical abundance regimes from this planet's
transmission spectrum. For instance, the width of the features at 1.5, 3.3, and
7 microns indicates the amount of HCN versus C2H2 present. The NIRSpec prism
mode will be useful due to its large spectral range and the relatively large
number of photo-electrons recorded per spectral resolution element. However,
extremely bright host stars like GJ 436 may be better observed with a higher
spectroscopic resolution mode in order to avoid detector saturation. We find
that observations with the MIRI low resolution spectrograph should also have
high signal-to-noise in the 5 - 10 micron range due to the brightness of the
star and the relatively low spectral resolution (R ~ 100) of this mode.

observational constraints. We assume that the star formation rate in a galaxy
can be expressed as the product of the IMF, $\psi (m)$, which is a smooth
function of mass $m$ (in units of \msun), and a time- and space-dependent total
rate of star formation per unit area of galactic disk. The mass dependence of
the proposed IMF is determined by five parameters: the low-mass slope $\gamma$,
the high-mass slope $-\Gamma$, the characteristic mass $m_{ch}$ (which is close
to the mass $m_{\rm peak}$ at which the IMF turns over), and the lower and
upper limits on the mass, $m_l$ (taken to be 0.004) and $m_u$ (taken to be
120). The star formation rate in terms of number of stars per unit area of
galactic disk per unit logarithmic mass interval, is proportional to
$m^{-\Gamma} \left\{1-\exp\left[{-(m/m_{ch})^{\gamma +\Gamma}}\right]\right\}$,
where $\cal N_*$ is the number of stars, $m_l<m<m_u$ is the range of stellar
masses. The values of $\gamma$ and $\emch$ are derived from two integral
constraints: i) the ratio of the number density of stars in the range
$m=0.1-0.6$ to that in the range $m=0.6-0.8$ as inferred from the mass
distribution of field stars in the local neighborhood, and ii) the ratio of the
number of stars in the range $m=0.08 - 1$ to the number of brown dwarfs in the
range $m=0.03-0.08$ in young clusters. The IMF satisfying the above constraints
is characterized by the parameters $\gamma=0.51$ and $\emch=0.35$ (which
corresponds to $m_{\rm peak}=0.27$). This IMF agrees quite well with the
Chabrier (2005) IMF for the entire mass range over which we have compared with
data, but predicts significantly more stars with masses $< 0.03\, M_\odot$; we
also compare with other IMFs in current use.

distributed computing. This is one of the most fundamental and well-studied
problems in this area. Currently, the best-known deterministic algorithms for
(2Delta -1)-edge-coloring requires O(Delta) + log-star n time \cite{PR01},
where Delta is the maximum degree of the input graph. Also, recent results of
\cite{BE10} for vertex-coloring imply that one can get an
O(Delta)-edge-coloring in O(Delta^{epsilon} \cdot \log n) time, and an
O(Delta^{1 + epsilon})-edge-coloring in O(log Delta log n) time, for an
arbitrarily small constant epsilon > 0.
  In this paper we devise a drastically faster deterministic edge-coloring
algorithm. Specifically, our algorithm computes an O(Delta)-edge-coloring in
O(Delta^{epsilon}) + log-star n time, and an O(Delta^{1 +
epsilon})-edge-coloring in O(log Delta) + log-star n time. This result improves
the previous state-of-the-art {exponentially} in a wide range of Delta,
specifically, for 2^{Omega(\log-star n)} \leq Delta \leq polylog(n). In
addition, for small values of Delta our deterministic algorithm outperforms all
the existing {randomized} algorithms for this problem.
  On our way to these results we study the {vertex-coloring} problem on the
family of graphs with bounded {neighborhood independence}. This is a large
family, which strictly includes line graphs of r-hypergraphs for any r = O(1),
and graphs of bounded growth. We devise a very fast deterministic algorithm for
vertex-coloring graphs with bounded neighborhood independence. This algorithm
directly gives rise to our edge-coloring algorithms, which apply to {general}
graphs.
  Our main technical contribution is a subroutine that computes an
O(Delta/p)-defective p-vertex coloring of graphs with bounded neighborhood
independence in O(p^2) + \log-star n time, for a parameter p, 1 \leq p \leq
Delta.

remarkable string of radio emission towards IRAS 16562-3959, a luminous
infrared source with a bolometric luminosity of $7.0\times10^4$ \Lsun. The
radio emission arises from a compact, bright central component, two inner
lobes, which are separated by about 7\arcsec\ and symmetrically offset from the
central source, and two outer lobes which are separated by about 45\arcsec. The
emission from the central object has a spectral index between 1.4 and 8.6 GHz
of $0.85\pm0.15$, consistent with free-free emission from a thermal jet. The
radio emission from the lobes have spectral indices in the range characteristic
of thermal emission. We suggest that the emission from the lobes arises in
shocks resulting from the interaction of a collimated wind with the surrounding
medium. The radio string is located within a massive dense molecular core, and
is associated with extended green emission (Spitzer 3-color), Herbig-Haro type
emission (2MASS K$_s$-band) and OH maser sites -- all phenomena readily
observed towards sites of massive star formation. We conclude that the massive
core hosts a high-mass star in an early stage of evolution in which it is
undergoing the ejection of a powerful collimated stellar wind, showing that
jets found in the formation of low-mass stars are also produced in high-mass
stars.

assess the membership of the X-ray sources based on color-color and
color-magnitude diagrams, as well as other properties, such as effective
temperatures, masses and bolometric luminosities.
  We detected a total of 164 X-ray sources, of which 66 are probable and
possible cluster members. A total of 16 are newly identified probable members.
The two XMM-Newton pointings east and west of the cluster center have allowed
us to verify the heterogeneous spatial distribution of young stars, probably
related to the large scale structure of the region. The disk fraction of the
X-ray detected cluster sample is very low, close to 10%, in remarkable contrast
to the low-mass stellar and substellar population (mostly undetected in X-rays)
where the disk fraction reaches about 50%. The X-ray luminosity function of C69
provides support for an age of several Myr when compared with other well known
young associations. With our improved cluster census we confirm previous
reports on the untypically low disk fraction compared to other clusters of
several Myr age. The different disk fractions of X-ray detected (essentially
solar-like) and undetected (mostly low-mass stars and brown dwarfs) members can
be understood as a consequence of a mass-dependence of the time-scale for disk
evolution.

a side result, the equivalence of two known path representations for the

offshoot is the gain of a new and simple weighting for the (Kyoto) path
representation that generalizes to level k. The bijection also suggests two
operator constructions for the su(2)_1 paths, a local and a nonlocal one, both
interrelated. These are formal operators that map a path to another path, so
that any path can be obtained by successive applications of these operators on
a simple reference (ground-state) path. The nonlocal operator description is
the starting point for a direct and elementary derivation of the su(2)_1 spinon
character. The second part presents an extensive study of the su(2)_2 paths
from their particle point of view, where the particles are defined as the path
building blocks. The resulting generating functions appear to provide new (at
least superficially) fermionic forms of the characters. In particular, a nice
relationship between the sum of the j=0,1 characters at k=2 and the two ones at

into the planetary regime, we demonstrate that magnetospheric processes may
govern accretion onto young gas giants in the isolation phase of their
development. Planets in the isolation phase have cleared out large gaps in
their surrounding circumstellar disks, and settled into a quasi-static
equilibrium with radii only modestly larger than their final sizes (i.e., $ r
\sim 1.4 r_{\rm final}$). Magnetospheric accretion is less likely to play a
role in a young gas giant's main accretion phase, when the planet's envelope is
predicted to be much larger than the planet's Alfv\'en radius. For a fiducial 1
M$_J$ gas giant planet with a remnant isolation phase accretion rate of
$\dot{M}_{\odot} =$ 10$^{-10} M_{\odot}{\rm yr}^{-1}=10^{-7}M_{J}{\rm

Jupiter's radius) and drive the planet to rotate with a period of $\sim$7
hours. Thermal emission from planetary magnetospheric accretion will be
difficult to observe; the most promising observational signatures may be
non-thermal, such as gyrosynchrotron radiation that is clearly modulated at a
period much shorter than the rotation period of the host star.

$G$. The directed domination number of a complete graph was first studied by
Erd\""{o}s [Math. Gaz. 47 (1963), 220--222], albeit in disguised form. In this
paper we prove a Greedy Partition Lemma for directed domination in oriented
graphs. Applying this lemma, we obtain bounds on the directed domination
number. In particular, if $\alpha$ denotes the independence number of a graph
$G$, we show that $\alpha \le \Gamma_d(G) \le \alpha(1+2\ln(n/\alpha))$.

by the elegant sampling formula of Ewens. This formula has helped shape our
expectations of empirical patterns of molecular variation. Along with
coalescent theory, it provides statistical techniques for rejecting the null
model of neutrality. However, we still do not fully understand the statistics
of the allelic diversity we expect to see in the presence of natural selection.
Earlier work has described the effects of strongly deleterious mutations linked
to many neutral sites, and allelic variation in models where offspring fitness
is unrelated to parental fitness, but it has proven difficult to understand
allelic diversity in the presence of purifying selection at many linked sites.
Here, we study the population genetics of infinitely many perfectly linked
sites, some neutral and some deleterious. Our approach is based on studying the
lineage structure within each class of individuals of similar fitness in the
deleterious mutation-selection balance. Analogous to the Ewens sampling
formula, we derive expressions for the likelihoods of any configuration of
allelic types in a sample. We find that for moderate and weak selection
pressures the patterns of allelic diversity cannot be described by a neutral
model for any choice of the effective population size, indicating that there is
power to detect selection from patterns of sampled allelic diversity.

genealogies and hence alters the patterns of sampled genetic variation.
Although these distortions may be common in nature, our understanding of how we
expect purifying selection to affect patterns of molecular variation remains
incomplete. Genealogical approaches such as coalescent theory have proven
difficult to generalize to situations involving selection at many linked sites,
unless selection pressures are extremely strong. Here, we introduce an
effective coalescent theory (a ""fitness-class coalescent"") to describe the
structure of genealogies in the presence of purifying selection at many linked
sites. We use this effective theory to calculate several simple statistics
describing the expected patterns of variation in sequence data, both at the
sites under selection and at linked neutral sites. Our analysis combines our
earlier description of the allele frequency spectrum in the presence of
purifying selection (Desai et al. 2010) with the structured coalescent approach
of Nordborg (1997), to trace the ancestry of individuals through the
distribution of fitnesses within the population. Alternatively, we can derive
our results using an extension of the coalescent approach of Hudson and Kaplan
(1994). We find that purifying selection leads to patterns of genetic variation
that are related but not identical to a neutrally evolving population in which
population size has varied in a specific way in the past.

of Horava-Lifshitz gravity in the high energy limit but our theory is
equivalent to Einstein gravity. Specifically, we find that the solutions of
general relativity, in a gauge where the spatial hypersurfaces have constant
mean extrinsic curvature, can be mapped to solutions of a particular gauge
fixing of the dual theory. Moreover, this duality is not accidental. We provide
a general geometric picture for our procedure that allows us to trade foliation

formation indicators, tracing dense molecular hydrogen gas [n(H2) > 10^5,cm^-3]
within star-forming molecular clouds. However, the strength of their respective
line emission in the J=6-5 transitions in APM08279+5255 is extremely high,
suggesting that they are excited by another mechanism besides collisions in the
dense molecular gas phase alone. We derive J=6-5 line luminosities of
L'(HCN)=(4.9+/-0.6), L'(HNC)=(2.4+/-0.7), and L'(HCO+)=(3.0+/-0.6)x10^10
(mu_L)^-1 K km/s pc^2 (where mu_L is the lensing magnification factor),
corresponding to L' ratios of ~0.23-0.46 relative to CO(J=1-0). Such high line
ratios would be unusual even in the respective ground-state (J=1-0)
transitions, and indicate exceptional, collisionally and radiatively driven
excitation conditions in the dense, star-forming molecular gas in
APM08279+5255. Through an expansion of our previous modeling of the HCN line
excitation in this source, we show that the high rotational line fluxes are
caused by substantial infrared pumping at moderate opacities in a ~220K warm
gas and dust component. This implies that standard M_dense/L' conversion
factors would substantially overpredict the dense molecular gas mass M_dense.
We also find a HCN J=6-5/5-4 L' ratio greater than 1 (1.36+/-0.31) - however,
our models show that the excitation is likely not `super-thermal', but that the
high line ratio is due to a rising optical depth between both transitions.
These findings are consistent with the picture that the bulk of the gas and
dust in this source is situated in a compact, nuclear starburst, where both the
highly active galactic nucleus and star formation contribute to the heating.

functions at the virtuality Q_0^2. For both G and F_s, we are able to either
devolve or evolve each separately and rapidly, with very high numerical
accuracy, a computational fractional precision of O(10^{-9}). Armed with this
powerful new tool in the pQCD arsenal, we compare our numerical results from
the above equations with the published MSTW2008 and CTEQ6L LO gluon and singlet
F_s distributions, starting from their initial values at Q_0^2=1 GeV^2 and 1.69
GeV^2, respectively, using their choices of \alpha_s(Q^2). This allows an
important independent check on the accuracies of their evolution codes and
therefore the computational accuracies of their published parton distributions.
Our method completely decouples the two LO distributions, at the same time
guaranteeing that both G and F_s satisfy the singlet coupled DGLAP equations.
It also allows one to easily obtain the effects of the starting functions on
the evolved gluon and singlet structure functions, as functions of both Q^2 and
Q_0^2, being equally accurate in devolution as in evolution. Further, it can
also be used for non-singlet distributions, thus giving LO analytic solutions
for individual quark and gluon distributions at a given x and Q^2, rather than
the numerical solutions of the coupled integral-differential equations on a

motivated the development of automated morphological classification schemes to
deal with large data volumes. Existing automated schemes can successfully
distinguish between early and late type galaxies and identify merger
candidates, but are inadequate for studying detailed morphologies of red
sequence galaxies. To fill this need, we present a new automated classification
scheme that focuses on making finer distinctions between early types roughly
corresponding to Hubble types E, S0, and Sa. We visually classify a sample of
984 non-starforming SDSS galaxies with apparent sizes >14"". We then develop an
automated method to closely reproduce the visual classifications, which both
provides a check on the visual results and makes it possible to extend
morphological analysis to much larger samples. We visually classify the
galaxies into three bulge classes (BC) by the shape of the light profile in the
outer regions: discs have sharp edges and bulges do not, while some galaxies
are intermediate. We separately identify galaxies with features: spiral arms,
bars, clumps, rings, and dust. We find general agreement between BC and the
bulge fraction B/T measured by the galaxy modeling package GIM2D, but many
visual discs have B/T>0.5. Three additional automated parameters -- smoothness,
axis ratio, and concentration -- can identify many of these high-B/T discs to
yield automated classifications that agree ~70% with the visual classifications
(>90% within one BC). Both methods are used to study the bulge vs. disc
frequency as a function of four measures of galaxy 'size': luminosity, stellar
mass, velocity dispersion, and radius. All size indicators show a fall in disc
fraction and a rise in bulge fraction among larger galaxies.

supermassive black holes (SBHs)? The answer to this question has direct
implications for the feasibility of coincident detections of electromagnetic
(EM) and gravitational wave (GW) signals from coalescences. Such detections are
considered to be the next observational grand challenge that will enable
testing general relativity in the strong, nonlinear regime and improve our
understanding of evolution and growth of these massive compact objects. In this
paper we review the properties of the environment of coalescing binaries in the
context of the circumbinary disk and hot, radiatively inefficient accretion
flow models and use them to mark the extent of the parameter space spanned by
this problem. We report the results from an ongoing, general relativistic,
hydrodynamical study of the inspiral and merger of black holes, motivated by
the latter scenario. We find that correlated EM+GW oscillations can arise
during the inspiral phase followed by the gradual rise and subsequent drop-off
in the light curve at the time of coalescence. While there are indications that
the latter EM signature is a more robust one, a detection of either signal
coincidentally with GWs would be a convincing evidence for an impending SBH
binary coalescence. The observability of an EM counterpart in the hot accretion
flow scenario depends on the details of a model. In the case of the most
massive binaries observable by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, upper
limits on luminosity imply that they may be identified by EM searches out to
z~0.1-1. However, given the radiatively inefficient nature of the gas flow, we
speculate that a majority of massive binaries may appear as low luminosity AGN
in the local universe.

recombination and for this reason is referred as the ""iron convection zone""

so do not possess an internal boundary layer akin to the solar tachocline.
Because that interface figures so prominently in many theories of the solar
magnetic dynamo, a widespread expectation had been that fully convective stars
would exhibit surface magnetic behavior very different from that realized in
more massive stars. Here I describe how recent observations and theoretical
models of dynamo action in low-mass stars are partly confirming, and partly
confounding, this basic expectation. In particular, I present the results of
3--D MHD simulations of dynamo action by convection in rotating spherical
shells that approximate the interiors of 0.3 solar-mass stars at a range of
rotation rates. The simulated stars can establish latitudinal differential
rotation at their surfaces which is solar-like at ``rapid'' rotation rates
(defined within) and anti-solar at slower rotation rates; the differential
rotation is greatly reduced by feedback from strong dynamo-generated magnetic
fields in some parameter regimes. I argue that this ``flip'' in the sense of
differential rotation may be observable in the near future. I also briefly
describe how the strength and morphology of the magnetic fields varies with the
rotation rate of the simulated star, and show that the maximum magnetic
energies attained are compatible with simple scaling arguments.

behavior that is considered cooperative by one population might be perceived as
non-cooperative from the viewpoint of another.
  To understand the dynamics and outcome of the competitive interactions within
and between groups, we study game-dynamical replicator equations for multiple
populations with incompatible interests and different power (be this due to
different population sizes, material resources, social capital, or other
factors). These equations allow us to address various important questions: For
example, can cooperation in the prisoner's dilemma be promoted, when two
interacting groups have different preferences? Under what conditions can costly
punishment, or other mechanisms, foster the evolution of norms? When does
cooperation fail, leading to antagonistic behavior, conflict, or even
revolutions? And what incentives are needed to reach peaceful agreements
between groups with conflicting interests?
  Our detailed quantitative analysis reveals a large variety of interesting
results, which are relevant for society, law and economics, and have
implications for the evolution of language and culture as well.

little Higgs models and models of vectorlike confinement. Similar to the decay
of the pion into photon pairs, these scalars mainly decay through
anomaly-induced interactions into electroweak gauge bosons, leading to a
distinct signal with three or more photons in the final state. We study the
standard model backgrounds for these signals, and find that the LHC can
discover these models over a large range of parameter space with 30 fb$^{-1}$

regions of parameter space. We also discuss possibilities to measure the spin
of the particles in the $\gamma \gamma $ and $Z\gamma $ decay channels.

depends on a parameter $\eta$, which is the product of the solid body size and
density. We find that the gravity of the protoplanetary disk has a
non-negligible effect on the trajectories. If a solid body re-enters the flared
disk, the re-entering radius depends on the stellar magnetic dipole moment, the
disk's gravity, the parameter $\eta$, and the initial launching angle. The
disk's gravity can make the re-entering radius lower by up to 30%. We find a
threshold $\eta$, denoted as $\eta_t$, for any particular configuration of the
X-wind, below which the solid bodies will be expelled from the planetary

depends on the mass of the disk. Only the solid bodies with a $\eta$ larger
than but very close to $\eta_t$ can be launched to a re-entering radius larger
than 1 AU. This size-sorting effect may explain why chondrules come with a
narrow range of sizes within each chondritic class. In general, the size
distributions of CAIs and chondrules in chondrites can be determined from the

from the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer. We divided the bursts in three groups,
photospheric radius expansion (PRE), hard non-PRE and soft non-PRE bursts,
based on the properties of the bursts and the state of the source at the time
of the burst. For the three types of bursts, we found that the average relation
between the bolometric flux and the temperature during the cooling phase of the
bursts is significantly different from the canonical $F \propto T^4$ relation
that is expected if the apparent emitting area on the surface of the neutron
star remains constant as the flux decreases during the decay of the bursts. We
also found that a single power law cannot fit the average flux-temperature
relation for any of the three types of bursts, and that the flux-temperature
relation for the three types of bursts is significantly different. Finally, for
the three types of bursts, the temperature distribution at different flux
levels during the decay of the bursts is significantly different. From the
above we conclude that hard non-PRE bursts ignite in a hydrogen-rich
atmosphere, whereas for soft non-PRE and PRE bursts the fuel is helium-rich. We
further conclude that the metal abundance in the neutron star atmosphere
decreases as the bursts decay, probably because the heavy elements sink faster
in the atmosphere than H and He.

abundances across three rotationally-supported star-forming galaxies at z~3,

strong normality is stronger than normality for the Cantor series expansion. In

becomes extinct. On the other hand, when resources are scarce it is the species

two species increases with dimension. We suggest that our model might describe
some aspects of the competition between normal and tumor cells. With such an

morphologies are presented. In the d=1 and d=2 models, we analyse the nature of
phase transitions: they are either discontinuous or belong to the
directed-percolation universality class, and in some cases they have an active
subcritical phase. In the d=2 case, one of the transitions seems to be
characterized by critical exponents different than directed-percolation ones,
but this transition could be also weakly discontinuous. In the d=3 version,
Monte Carlo simulations are in a good agreement with the solution of the
mean-field approximation. This approximation predicts that oscillatory
behaviour occurs in the present model, but only for d>2. For d>=2, a steady

for distributed storage systems, characterized by a low-complexity uncoded
repair process that can tolerate multiple node failures. These codes consist of
the concatenation of two components: an outer MDS code followed by an inner
repetition code. We refer to the inner code as a Fractional Repetition code
since it consists of splitting the data of each node into several packets and
storing multiple replicas of each on different nodes in the system.
  Our model for repair is table-based, and thus, differs from the random access
model adopted in the literature. We present constructions of Fractional
Repetition codes based on regular graphs and Steiner systems for a large set of
system parameters. The resulting codes are guaranteed to achieve the storage
capacity for random access repair. The considered model motivates a new
definition of capacity for distributed storage systems, that we call Fractional
Repetition capacity. We provide upper bounds on this capacity while a precise
expression remains an open problem.

Algebraic Logic of some bilattice-based logical systems introduced in the
nineties by Ofer Arieli and Arnon Avron. The motivation for such an
investigation has two main roots. On the one hand there is an interest in
bilattices as an elegant formalism that gave rise in the last two decades to a
variety of applications, especially in the field of Theoretical Computer
Science and Artificial Intelligence. In this respect, the present study aims to
be a contribution to a better understanding of the mathematical and logical
framework that underlie these applications. On the other hand, our interest in
bilattice-based logics comes from Abstract Algebraic Logic. In very general
terms, algebraic logic can be described as the study of the connections between
algebra and logic. One of the main reasons that motivate this study is the
possibility to treat logical problems with algebraic methods and viceversa:
this is accomplished by associating to a logical system a class of algebraic
models that can be regarded as the algebraic counterpart of that logic.
Starting from the work of Tarski and his collaborators, the method of
algebraizing logics has been increasingly developed and generalized. In the
last two decades, algebraic logicians have focused their attention on the
process of algebraization itself: this kind of investigation forms now a
subfield of algebraic logic known as Abstract Algebraic Logic (which we
abbreviate AAL).

circular orbits to those that plunge into a black hole. In the test-mass limit,
well-defined ISCO conditions exist for the Kerr and Schwarzschild spacetimes.
In the finite-mass case, there are a large variety of ways to define an ISCO in
a post-Newtonian (PN) context. Here I generalize the gauge-invariant ISCO
condition of Blanchet & Iyer (2003) to the case of spinning (nonprecessing)
binaries. The Blanchet-Iyer ISCO condition has two desirable and unexpected
properties: (1) it exactly reproduces the Schwarzschild ISCO in the test-mass
limit, and (2) it accurately approximates the recently-calculated shift in the
Schwarzschild ISCO frequency due to the conservative-piece of the gravitational
self-force [Barack & Sago (2009)]. The generalization of this ISCO condition to
spinning binaries has the property that it also exactly reproduces the Kerr
ISCO in the test-mass limit (up to the order at which PN spin corrections are
currently known). The shift in the ISCO due to the spin of the test-particle is
also calculated. Remarkably, the gauge-invariant PN ISCO condition exactly
reproduces the ISCO shift predicted by the Papapetrou equations for a
fully-relativistic spinning particle. It is surprising that an analysis of the
stability of the standard PN equations of motion is able (without any form of
""resummation"") to accurately describe strong-field effects of the Kerr
spacetime. The ISCO frequency shift due to the conservative self-force in Kerr
is also calculated from this new ISCO condition, as well as from the
effective-one-body Hamiltonian of Barausse & Buonanno (2010). These results
serve as a useful point-of-comparison for future gravitational self-force
calculations in the Kerr spacetime.

Simultaneous expansion and collapse of cavitation bubbles can enhance the

associated rupture zone. An analytical model of the flow induced by the bubbles
is presented and experimentally verified. The threshold strain of the material
rupture is measured in a model tissue. Using the computational model and the
experimental value of the threshold strain one can compute the shape of the
rupture zone in tissue resulting from application of multiple bubbles. With the
threshold strain of 0.7 two simultaneous bubbles produce a continuous cut when
applied at the distance 1.35 times greater than that required in sequential
approach. Simultaneous focusing of the laser in multiple spots along the line
of intended cut can extend this ratio to 1.7. Counter-propagating jets forming

extend the cutting zone - up to a factor of 1.54.

most particles have accumulated at the periphery of the deposit. In this work,
the formation of deposits during the drying of nanoliter colloidal drops on a
flat substrate is investigated numerically and experimentally. A finite-element
numerical model is developed that solves the Navier-Stokes, heat and mass
transport equations in a Lagrangian framework. The diffusion of vapor in the
atmosphere is solved numerically, providing an exact boundary condition for the
evaporative flux at the droplet-air interface. Laplace stresses and thermal
Marangoni stresses are accounted for. The particle concentration is tracked by
solving a continuum advection-diffusion equation. Wetting line motion and the
interaction of the free surface of the drop with the growing deposit are
modeled based on criteria on wetting angles. Numerical results for evaporation
times and flow field are in very good agreement with published experimental and
theoretical results. We also performed transient visualization experiments of
water and isopropanol drops loaded with polystyrene microsphere evaporating on
respectively glass and polydimethylsiloxane substrates. Measured evaporation
times, deposit shape and sizes, and flow fields are in very good agreement with
the numerical results. Different flow patterns caused by the competition of
Marangoni loops and radial flow are shown to determine the deposit shape to be
either a ring-like pattern or a homogeneous bump.

considered by looking at a model problem in which the evolution of a
constant-volume liquid bridge is studied as the bridge is stretched. The bridge
is pinned with a fixed diameter at the upper contact point, but the contact
line at the lower attachment point is free to move on a smooth substrate.
Experiments indicate that initially, as the bridge is stretched, the lower
contact line slowly retreats inwards. However at a critical radius, the bridge
becomes unstable, and the contact line accelerates dramatically, moving inwards
very quickly. The bridge subsequently pinches off, and a small droplet is left
on the substrate. A quasi-static analysis, using the Young-Laplace equation, is
used to accurately predict the shape of the bridge during the initial bridge
evolution, including the initial onset of the slow contact line retraction. A
stability analysis is used to predict the onset of pinch-off, and a
one-dimensional dynamical equation, coupled with a Tanner-law for the dynamic
contact angle, is used to model the rapid pinch-off behavior. Excellent
agreement between numerical predictions and experiments is found throughout the
bridge evolution, and the importance of the dynamic contact line model is
demonstrated.

shapes from spotted drops at different pH values are measured using a laser

these patterns is explained by considering how DLVO interactions such as the
electrostatic and van der Waals forces modify the particle deposition process.
Also a phase diagram is proposed to describe how the shape of a colloidal

driven by evaporation at the wetting line, a Marangoni recirculating flow
driven by surface tension gradients, and the transport of particles towards the
substrate driven by DLVO interactions. This phase diagram explains three types

measure the temperature at the solid-liquid interface, with a time and space
resolution of 100 {\mu}s and 20 {\mu}m, respectively. Isopropanol droplets with
micro- and nanoliter volumes are considered. A finite-element model is used to
simulate the transient fluid dynamics and heat transfer during the droplet
deposition process, considering the dynamics of wetting as well as Laplace and
Marangoni stresses on the liquid-gas boundary. For cases involving evaporation,
the diffusion of vapor in the atmosphere is solved numerically, providing an
exact boundary condition for the evaporative flux at the droplet-air interface.
High-speed visualizations are performed to provide matching parameters for the
wetting model used in the simulations. Numerical and experimental results are
compared for the transient heat transfer and the fluid dynamics involved during
the droplet deposition. Our results describe and explain temperature
oscillations at the drop-substrate interface during the early stages of impact.
For the first time, a full simulation of the impact and subsequent evaporation
of a drop on a heated surface is performed, and excellent agreement is found
with the experimental results. Our results also shed light on the influence of
wetting on the heat transfer during evaporation.

networks. However, the resultant performance gains can be significantly
compromised in practice if the precoder design fails to account for the
inaccuracy in the channel state information (CSI) feedback. This paper
addresses this issue by considering finite-rate CSI feedback from receivers to
their interfering transmitters in the two-user multiple-input-multiple-output
(MIMO) interference channel, called cooperative feedback, and proposing a
systematic method for designing transceivers comprising linear precoders and
equalizers. Specifically, each precoder/equalizer is decomposed into inner and
outer components for nulling the cross-link interference and achieving array
gain, respectively. The inner precoders/equalizers are further optimized to
suppress the residual interference resulting from finite-rate cooperative
feedback. Further- more, the residual interference is regulated by additional
scalar cooperative feedback signals that are designed to control transmission
power using different criteria including fixed interference margin and maximum
sum throughput. Finally, the required number of cooperative precoder feedback
bits is derived for limiting the throughput loss due to precoder quantization.

cm-wave continuum emission in a prominent molecular cloud, nearby and with
complementary observational data. We acquired Cosmic Background Imager (CBI)
visibility data of M 78 at 31 GHz with an angular resolution of $\sim
5.8\arcmin$ and CBI2 data at an angular resolution of $\sim 4.2\arcmin$. A
morphological analysis was undertaken to search for possible correlations with
templates that trace different emission mechanisms. Using data from WMAP and
the Rhodes/HartRAO 2326 MHz survey we constructed the spectral energy
distribution (SED) of M 78 in a $45\arcmin$ circular aperture. We used results
from the literature to constrain the physical conditions and the stellar
content. The 5 GHz -- 31 GHz spectral index in flux density ($\alpha = 1.89\pm
0.15$) is significantly different from optically thin free-free values. We also
find closer morphological agreement with IR dust tracers than with free-free
sources. Dust-correlated cm-wave emission that is not due to free-free is
significant at small scales ($\sim 8\arcmin$). However, a free-free background
dominates at cm-wavelengths on large scales ($\sim 1$ deg). We correct for this
uniform background by differencing against a set of reference fields. The
differenced SED of M 78 shows excess emission at 10-70 GHz over free-free and a
modified blackbody, at $3.4\sigma$. The excess is matched by the spinning dust
model from Draine and Lazarian (1998).

surprisingly strong Lyman continuum (LyC; ~900A in the rest-frame) from some
LAEs at z=3.1. However, the redshifts might be misidentified due to a narrow
wavelength coverage in previous spectroscopy. We here present new deep
spectroscopy covering the observed 4,000-7,000A with VLT/VIMOS and Subaru/FOCAS
of 8 LAEs detected in NB359. All the 8 objects have only one detectable
emission line around 4,970A which is most likely to be Ly-A at z=3.1, and thus,
the objects are certainly LAEs at the redshift. However, 5 of them show a
~0.''8 spatial offset between the Ly-A emission and the source detected in
NB359. No indications of the redshifts of the NB359 sources are found although
it is statistically difficult that all the 5 LAEs have a foreground object
accounting for the NB359 flux. The rest 3 LAEs show no significant offset from
the NB359 position. Therefore, they are truly LyC emitting LAEs at z=3.1. We
also examine the stellar population which simultaneously accounts for the
strength of the LyC and the spectral slope of non-ionizing ultraviolet of the
LAEs. We consider the latest statistics of Lyman limit systems to estimate the
LyC optical depth in the IGM and an additional contribution of the bound-free
LyC from photo-ionized nebulae to the LyC emissivity. As a result, we find that
stellar populations with metallicity Z>=1/50Z_sun can explain the observed LyC
strength only with a very top-heavy initial mass function (IMF; <m>~50 M_sun).
However, the critical metallicity for such an IMF is expected to be much lower.
A very young (~1 Myr) and massive (~100 M_sun) extremely metal-poor
(Z<=5e-4Z_sun) or metal-free (so-called Population III) stellar population can
reproduce the observed LyC strength. The required mass fraction of such
`primordial' stellar population is ~1--10% in total stellar mass of the LAEs.

nonlinear response of dense colloidal suspensions to large amplitude
oscillatory shear flow. The time-dependent stress response is calculated using
a recently developed schematic mode-coupling-type theory describing colloidal
suspensions under externally applied flow. For finite strain amplitudes the
theory generates a nonlinear response, characterized by significant higher
harmonic contributions. An important feature of the theory is the prediction of
an ideal glass transition at sufficiently strong coupling, which is accompanied
by the discontinuous appearance of a dynamic yield stress. For the oscillatory
shear flow under consideration we find that the yield stress plays an important
role in determining the non linearity of the time-dependent stress response.
Our theoretical findings are strongly supported by both large amplitude
oscillatory (LAOS) experiments (with FT-rheology analysis) on suspensions of
thermosensitive core-shell particles dispersed in water and Brownian dynamics
simulations performed on a two-dimensional binary hard-disc mixture. In
particular, theory predicts nontrivial values of the exponents governing the
final decay of the storage and loss moduli as a function of strain amplitude
which are in excellent agreement with both simulation and experiment. A
consistent set of parameters in the presented schematic model achieves to
jointly describe linear moduli, nonlinear flow curves and large amplitude

investigate the hypothetical detection of the photons radiated and how they
could provide an indirect way of verifying the cosmological relevance of
axions. Assuming that the cosmic ray flux is of the form J(E)~ E^-g we find
that the energy radiated follows a distribution k^-((g-1)/2) for proton
primaries, identical to the Galaxy synchrotron radiation that is the main
background, and k^-(g/2) for electron primaries, which in spite of this sharper
decay provide the dominant contribution in the low-energy spectrum. We discuss
possible ways to detect this small diffuse contribution. Local detection in the
vicinity of powerful cosmic rays emitters might also be possible.

the product design because on it will depend the functionality of the mechanism
its assemblibility but also its cost: manufacturing cost increases with the
precision of tolerances values. In our model, each feature specification is
translated into tolerance zone. This zone limits displacements of the
toleranced feature. Limitations of this small displacements are expressed in a
mathematical form by a 6-polytope in a 6 dimensions space (3 rotations and 3
translations). In the same way, contact conditions in joints allow to write
linear inequalities which can be translated by 6-polytopes. Each domain is
defined by a set of vertices and a system of inequalities. Considering a chosen
tolerancing, the method allows to verify the mechanism assemblibility but also
several functional requirements. The example of a minimal clearance requirement
between two surfaces will be treated. We will show the residual clearance zone
associated to these surfaces considering tolerances on parts and clearances in
joints. With such a tool, the designer will be able to modify values of the

algorithmic information theory. We present a recent application of Kolmogorov
complexity: classification using compression, an idea with provocative
implementation by authors such as Bennett, Vitanyi and Cilibrasi. This stresses
how Kolmogorov complexity, besides being a foundation to randomness, is also
related to classification. Another approach to classification is also
considered: the so-called ""Google classification"". It uses another original and
attractive idea which is connected to the classification using compression and
to Kolmogorov complexity from a conceptual point of view. We present and unify
these different approaches to classification in terms of Bottom-Up versus
Top-Down operational modes, of which we point the fundamental principles and
the underlying duality. We look at the way these two dual modes are used in
different approaches to information system, particularly the relational model
for database introduced by Codd in the 70's. This allows to point out diverse
forms of a fundamental duality. These operational modes are also reinterpreted

that the drops get flattened by this action. The transformation is of course
reversible: as the magnet is withdrawn, the liquid recovers its quasi-spherical

magnet, they slow down significantly, a consequence of their deformation:
despite a very low friction, the vibrations induced by the drop deformations
represent an important source of dissipation: below a well-defined velocity,
drops can even be stopped in the magnetic trap. Quicker ones can be decelerated

calculated from observable quantities at a desired averaging scale, $\alpha$.
An observable divergence theorem is then proved and applied in the derivation
of the observable and regularized transport equations. We further show that the
application of the observable divergence theorem to incompressible flows
results in a formal derivation of the inviscid Leray turbulence model first
proposed in 1934. It is argued that such a methodology in deriving fluid
evolution equations removes many of the theoretical and computational
difficulties in multi-scale problems such as turbulence and shocks.

observational strategies in averaging out the radial velocity signature of
stellar noise. We also derive the planetary mass detection limits expected in
presence of stellar noise. We start with HARPS asteroseismology measurements
for 4 stars (beta Hyi, alpha Cen A, mu Ara and tau Ceti) available in the ESO
archive plus very precise measurements of alpha Cen B. This sample covers
different spectral types, from G2 to K1 and different evolutionary stage, from
subgiant to dwarf stars. Since the span of our data ranges between 5 to 8 days,
we will have access to oscillation modes and granulation phenomena, without
important contribution of activity noise which is present at larger time
scales. For those 5 stars, we generate synthetic radial velocity measurements
after fitting corresponding models of stellar noise in Fourier space. These
measurements allows us to study the radial velocity variation due to stellar
noise for different observational strategies as well as the corresponding
planetary mass detection limits. Applying 3 measurements per night of 10
minutes exposure each, 2 hours apart, seems to average out most efficiently the
stellar noise considered. For quiet K1V stars as alpha Cen B, such a strategy
allows us to detect planets of ~3 times the mass of Earth with an orbital
period of 200 days, corresponding to the habitable zone of the star. Since
activity is not yet included in our simulation, these detection limits
correspond to a case, which exist, where the host star has few magnetic
features. In this case stellar noise is dominated by oscillation modes and
granulation phenomena.

of that digraph, was introduced as a direct criterion on the solvability of a
network coding instance. This paper makes two contributions on the guessing
number. First, we introduce an undirected graph on all possible configurations
of the digraph, referred to as the guessing graph, which encapsulates the
essence of dependence amongst configurations. We prove that the guessing number
of a digraph is equal to the logarithm of the independence number of its
guessing graph. Therefore, network coding solvability is no more a problem on
the operations made by each node, but is simplified into a problem on the
messages that can transit through the network. By studying the guessing graph
of a given digraph, and how to combine digraphs or alphabets, we are thus able
to derive bounds on the guessing number of digraphs. Second, we construct
specific digraphs with high guessing numbers, yielding network coding instances
where a large amount of information can transit. We first propose a
construction of digraphs with finite parameters based on cyclic codes, with
guessing number equal to the degree of the generator polynomial. We then
construct an infinite class of digraphs with arbitrary girth for which the
ratio between the linear guessing number and the number of vertices tends to
one, despite these digraphs being arbitrarily sparse. These constructions yield
solvable network coding instances with a relatively small number of
intermediate nodes for which the node operations are known and linear, although
these instances are sparse and the sources are arbitrarily far from their
corresponding sinks.

analyze the temporal and spatial behaviors of the energy and heat transport in

Cattaneo's model is performed. Both models show the transition between
nonthermal (ballistic) and thermal (ballistic-diffusive) regimes. Furthermore,
because the new model considers the discrete character of the lattice, it
highlights some new phenomena such as damped oscillations in the energy
transport both in time and space. The energy relaxation of the conduction band
electrons in metals is considered to be governed by the electron-phonon
scattering, and the scattering time is taken to be averaged over the Fermi
surface. Using the new formalism, one can quantify the transfer from nonthermal
modes to thermal ones as energy propagates in the material and it is
transformed into heat. While the thermal contribution shows a wave-front and an
almost exponentially decaying behavior with time, the nonthermal part shows a
wave-front and a damped oscillating behavior. Two superimposed oscillations are
identified; a fast oscillation that is attributed to the nonthermal nature of
energy transport at very short time scales and a slow oscillation that
describes the nature of the transition from the nonthermal regime to the

does not lead to a shear induced modification of the equilibrium density
profile, which would be expected on physical grounds. By introducing a
physically motivated dynamic mean field correction we incorporate the missing
shear induced interparticle forces into the theory. We find that the shear flow
tends to enhance the oscillations in the density profile of hard-spheres at a
hard-wall and, at sufficiently high shear rates, induces a nonequilibrium
transition to a steady state characterized by planes of particles parallel to
the wall. Under gravity, we find that the center-of-mass of the density

or ideas become popular relative to other (often qualitatively similar)
competitors? To investigate this question in detail, we have focused on the
popularity of movies as measured by their box-office income. We observe that
the log-normal distribution describes well the tail (corresponding to the most
successful movies) of the empirical distributions for the total income, the
income on the opening week, as well as, the weekly income per theater. This
observation suggests that popularity may be the outcome of a linear
multiplicative stochastic process. In addition, the distributions of the total
income and the opening income show a bimodal form, with the majority of movies
either performing very well or very poorly in theaters. We also observe that
the gross income per theater for a movie at any point during its lifetime is,
on average, inversely proportional to the period that has elapsed after its
release. We argue that (i) the log-normal nature of the tail, (ii) the bimodal
form of the overall gross income distribution, and (iii) the decay of gross
income per theater with time as a power law, constitute the fundamental set of
{\em stylized facts} (i.e., empirical ""laws"") that can be used to explain other
observations about movie popularity. We show that, in conjunction with an
assumption of a fixed lower cut-off for income per theater below which a movie
is withdrawn from a cinema, these laws can be used to derive a Weibull
distribution for the survival probability of movies which agrees with empirical
data. The connection to extreme-value distributions suggests that popularity
can be viewed as a process where a product becomes popular by avoiding failure
(i.e., being pulled out from circulation) for many successive time periods. We
suggest that these results may apply to popularity in general.

real space, operators of E and B mode decomposition involve only differentials
of CMB polarization. We may, therefore in principle, perform a clean E/B
decomposition from incomplete sky data. Since it is impractical to apply second
derivatives to observation data, we usually rely on spherical harmonic
transformation and inverse transformation, instead of using real-space
operators. In spherical harmonic representation, jump discontinuities in a cut
sky produces Gibbs phenomenon, unless a spherical harmonic expansion is made up
to an infinitely high multipole. By smoothing a foreground mask, we may
suppress the Gibbs phenomenon effectively in a similar manner to apodization of
a foreground mask discussed in other works. However, we incur foreground
contamination by smoothing a foreground mask, because zero-value pixels in the
original mask may be rendered non-zero by the smoothing process. In this work,
we investigate an optimal foreground mask, which ensures proper foreground
masking and suppresses Gibbs phenomenon. We apply our method to a simulated map
of the pixel resolution comparable to the Planck satellite. The simulation
shows that the leakage power is lower than unlensed CMB B mode power spectrum
of tensor-to-scalar ratio $r\sim 1\times10^{-7}$. We compare the result with
that of the original mask. We find that the leakage power is reduced by a
factor of $10^{6} \sim 10^{9}$ at the cost of a sky fraction $0.07$, and that
the enhancement is highest at lowest multipoles. We confirm that all the
zero-value pixels in the original mask remain zero in our mask. The application
of this method to the Planck data will improve the detectability of primordial
tensor perturbation.

initial state of the composite system is taken to be a product state of a pure
state of the system and a pure state of the environment. The latter pure state
is prepared such that it represents the environment at a given finite
temperature in the canonical ensemble. The state of the composite system
evolves according to the time-dependent Schr{\""{o}}dinger equation, the
interaction creating entanglement between the system and the environment. It is
shown that independent of the strength of the interaction and the initial
temperature of the environment, all the eigenvalues of the reduced density
matrix converge to their stationary values, implying that also the entropy of
the system relaxes to a stationary value. We demonstrate that the difference
between the canonical density matrix and the reduced density matrix in the
stationary state increases as the initial temperature of the environment
decreases. As our numerical simulations are necessarily restricted to a modest
number of spin-1/2 particles ($<36$), but do not rely on time-averaging of
observables nor on the assumption that the coupling between system and
environment is weak, they suggest that the stationary state of the system
directly follows from the time evolution of a pure state of the composite

neighbourhood presented in Just & Jahreiss (2010), which are based on different
star formation histories (SFR) and fit the local kinematics of main sequence
stars equally well, to predict star counts towards the North Galactic Pole
(NGP). We combined these four different models with the local main sequence in
the filter system of the SDSS and predicted the star counts in the NGP field
with b>80deg. All models fit the Hess diagrams in the F-K dwarf regime better
than 20 percent and the star number densities in the solar neighbourhood are
consistent with the observed values. The chi^2 analysis shows that model A is
clearly preferred with systematic deviations of a few percent only. The SFR of
model A is characterised by a maximum at an age of 10Gyr and a decline by a
factor of four to the present day value of 1.4Msun/pc^2/Gyr. The thick disc can
be modelled very well by an old isothermal simple stellar population. The
density profile can be approximated by a sech^(alpha_t) function. We found a
power law index alpha_t=1.16 and a scale height of 800pc corresponding to a
vertical velocity dispersion of 45.3km/s. About 6 percent of the stars in the
solar neighbourhood are thick disc stars.

complete genomes of individuals sequenced and assembled. This rich and focused
genotype information can be used to do different population-wide studies, now
first time directly on whole genome level. We propose a way to index population
genotype information together with the complete genome sequence, so that one
can use the index to efficiently align a given sequence to the genome with all
plausible genotype recombinations taken into account. This is achieved through
converting a multiple alignment of individual genomes into a finite automaton
recognizing all strings that can be read from the alignment by switching the
sequence at any time. The finite automaton is indexed with an extension of
Burrows-Wheeler transform to allow pattern search inside the plausible
recombinant sequences. The size of the index stays limited, because of the high
similarity of individual genomes. The index finds applications in variation
calling and in primer design. On a variation calling experiment, we found about
1.0% of matches to novel recombinants just with exact matching, and up to 2.4%
with approximate matching.

Kuzushi (Unbalance) -Tsukuri (the entry and proper fitting of Tori's body into
the position taken just before throwing) phases of Judo Throwing techniques.
The whole effective movement is without separation, as already stated by old
Japanese biomechanical studies (1972 -1978), only one skilled connected action,
but the biomechanical analysis is able to separate the whole in didactic steps
called Action Invariants. The first important finding singled out is the
existence of two classes of Action Invariants the first the General one'
connected to the whole body motion is specific of shortening distance in the
Kuzushi Tsukuri Phase. The second one, the Specific Action Invariants is
connected to the superior and inferior kinetic chains motion and right
positioning connected both to Kuzushi and Tsukuri phases. Some interesting
findings derive from this analysis: among throwing techniques, couple
techniques could be independent from Kuzushi; instead physical lever groups
need all two action invariants to be performed successfully and as complex
motor skill they are more difficult to perform than the first ones. Complexity
in motion is connected to the energy consumption, and to the skill ability of
athletes. This biomechanical comparative analysis is useful from the didactic
point of view, clarifying the basic mechanical steps of all throws, and showing
also hidden connections, similarities and differences among throwing Judo
techniques. The last part of the paper concerns the study on Interaction in
Competition, performed by the author, showing 20 years results on Judo

the weak scale. However, Nature may employ Dirac and Majorana scales that are
much less than typically assumed, possibly even far below the weak scale. In
this case the seesaw mechanism alone would not completely explain the lightness
of the neutrinos. In this work we consider a warped framework that realizes
this possibility by combining naturally suppressed Dirac and Majorana scales
together in a mini-seesaw mechanism to generate light neutrino masses. Via the

medium access control (MAC) layers of mobile ad hoc or peer-to-peer networks
formed by half-duplex radios. A node equipped with such a radio cannot
simultaneously transmit and receive useful signals at the same frequency.
Unlike in conventional designs, where a node's transmission frames are
scheduled away from its reception, each node transmits its signal through a
randomly generated on-off duplex mask (or signature) over every frame interval,
and receive a signal through each of its own off-slots. This is called rapid
on-off- division duplex (RODD). Over the period of a single frame, every node
can transmit a message to some or all of its peers, and may simultaneously
receive a message from each peer. Thus RODD achieves virtual full-duplex
communication using half-duplex radios and can simplify the design of higher
layers of a network protocol stack significantly. The throughput of RODD is
evaluated under some general settings, which is significantly larger than that
of ALOHA. RODD is especially efficient in case the dominant traffic is
simultaneous broadcast from nodes to their one-hop peers, such as in
spontaneous wireless social networks, emergency situations or on battlefield.
Important design issues of peer discovery, distribution of on-off signatures,
synchronization and error-control coding are also addressed.

affected by the YORP effect. In a related effect, Binary YORP (BYORP) the
orbital properties of a binary asteroid evolves under a radiation effect mostly
acting on a tidally locked secondary. The BYORP effect can alter the orbital
elements in $\sim 10^{4-5}$ years for a $D_{p}=2\;km$ primary with a
$D_{s}=0.4\; km$ secondary at $1\; AU$. It can either separate the binary
components or cause them to collide. In this paper we devise a simple approach
to calculate the YORP effect on asteroids and BYORP effect on binaries
including $J_2$ effects due to primary oblateness and the sun. We apply this to
asteroids with known shapes as well as a set of randomly generated bodies with
various degrees of smoothness. We find a strong correlation between the
strengths of an asteroid's YORP and BYORP effects. Therefore, a statistical
knowledge on one, could be used to estimate the effect of the other. We show
that the action of BYORP preferentially shrinks rather than expands the binary
orbit and that YORP preferentially slows down asteroids. This conclusion holds
for the two extremes of thermal conductivities studied in this work and
assuming the asteroid reaches a stable point, but may break down for moderate
thermal conductivity. The YORP and BYORP effects are shown to be smaller than
what could be naively expected due to near cancellation of the effects on small
scales. Taking this near cancellation into account, a simple order of magnitude
estimate of the YORP and BYORP effects as function of the sizes and smoothness
of the bodies is calculated. Finally, we provide a simple proof showing that
there is no secular effect due to absorption of radiation in BYORP.

the ROSt construction is the same for mean-field models (like the

setup is a good common ground to study the effect of dimensionality on the
properties of the Gibbs measure. In this spirit, it is shown, using translation
invariance, that the ROSt of the EA model possesses a local stability that is
stronger than stochastic stability, a property known to hold at almost all
temperatures in many spin glass models with Gaussian couplings. This fact is
used to prove stochastic stability for the EA spin glass at all temperatures

operation in the THz range and excellent coupling to spintronics. Several
magnonic analog and digital logic devices have been proposed, and some
demonstrated. Just as for spintronics, a key issue for magnonics is the large
power required to control/write information (conventionally achieved through
magnetic fields applied by strip lines, or by spin transfer from large
spin-polarized currents). Here we show that in BiFeO3, a room-temperature
magnetoelectric material, the spin wave frequency (>600 GHz) can be tuned
electrically by over 30%, in a non-volatile way and with virtually no power
dissipation. Theoretical calculations indicate that this effect originates from
a linear magnetoelectric effect related to spin-orbit coupling induced by the
applied electric field. We argue that these properties make BiFeO3 a promising
medium for spin wave generation, conversion and control in future magnonics

powerful way of understanding the properties of the convective zones of
solar-type stars. In this framework, the description of the temporal
correlation between turbulent eddies is an essential ingredient to model mode
amplitudes. However, there is a debate between a Gaussian or Lorentzian
description of the eddy-time correlation function (Samadi et al. 2003, Chaplin
et al. 2005). Indeed, a Gaussian description reproduces the low-frequency shape
of the mode amplitude for the Sun, but is unsatisfactory from a theoretical
point of view (Houdek, 2009) and leads to other disagreements with observations
(Samadi et al., 2007). These are solved by using a Lorentzian description, but
there the low-frequency shape of the solar observations is not correctly
reproduced. We reconcile the two descriptions by adopting the sweeping
approximation, which consists in assuming that the eddy-time-correlation
function is dominated by the advection of eddies, in the inertial range, by
energy-bearing eddies. Using a Lorentzian function together with a cut-off
frequency derived from the sweeping assumption allows us to reproduce the
low-frequency shape of the observations. This result also constitutes a
validation of the sweeping assumption for highly turbulent flows as in the
solar case.

a quiescent bath of other particles, makes their spatial distribution
inhomogeneous: the bath particles accumulate in front of the biased particle
(BP) and are depleted behind. In fact, a BP travels together with the
inhomogeneity it creates. A natural question is what will happen with two BPs
when they appear sufficiently close to each other such that the inhomogeneities
around each of them start to interfere? In quest for the answer we examine
here, via Monte Carlo simulations, the dynamics of two BPs in a lattice gas of
bath particles. We observe that for a sufficiently dense medium, surprisingly,
both BPs spend most of the time together which signifies that the interference
of the microstructural inhomogeneities results in effectively attractive
interactions between them. Such statistical pairing of BPs minimizes the size
of the inhomogeneity and hence reduces the frictional drag force exerted on the
BPs by the medium. As a result, in some configurations the center-of-mass of a
pair of BPs propagates faster than a single isolated BP. These jamming-induced
forces are very different from fundamental physical interactions, exist only in
presence of an external force, and require the presence of a quiescent bath to
mediate the interactions between the driven particles.

safety in which the code supplier provides a program together with an
abstraction (or abstract model of the program) whose validity entails
compliance with a predefined safety policy. The advantage of providing a
(fixpoint) abstraction to the code consumer is that its validity is checked in
a single pass (i.e., one iteration) of an abstract interpretation-based
checker. A main challenge to make ACC useful in practice is to reduce the size
of certificates as much as possible while at the same time not increasing
checking time. The intuitive idea is to only include in the certificate
information that the checker is unable to reproduce without iterating. We
introduce the notion of reduced certificate which characterizes the subset of
the abstraction which a checker needs in order to validate (and re-construct)
the full certificate in a single pass. Based on this notion, we instrument a
generic analysis algorithm with the necessary extensions in order to identify
the information relevant to the checker. Interestingly, the fact that the
reduced certificate omits (parts of) the abstraction has implications in the
design of the checker. We provide the sufficient conditions which allow us to
ensure that 1) if the checker succeeds in validating the certificate, then the
certificate is valid for the program (correctness) and 2) the checker will
succeed for any reduced certificate which is valid (completeness). Our approach
has been implemented and benchmarked within the ciaopp system. The experimental
results show that our proposal is able to greatly reduce the size of
