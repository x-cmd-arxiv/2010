each other forming a cooperative radio network. Security remains a major
challenge for these networks due to their features of open medium, dynamically
changing topologies, reliance on cooperative algorithms, absence of centralized
monitoring points, and lack of any clear lines of defense. Most of the
currently existing security algorithms designed for these networks are
insecure, in efficient, and have low detection accuracy for nodes'
misbehaviour. In this paper, a new approach has been proposed to bring out the
complementary relationship between key distribution and misbehaviour detection
for developing an integrated security solution for MANETs. The redundancy of
routing information in ad hoc networks is utilized to develop a highly reliable
protocol that works even in presence of transient network partitioning and
Byzantine failure of nodes. The proposed mechanism is fully co-operative, and
thus it is more robust as the vulnerabilities of the election algorithms used
for choosing the subset of nodes for cooperation are absent. Simulation results
show the effectiveness of the proposed protocol.

compare these estimates to those based on the photometry and color of stellar

galaxies in our sample cannot be substantially overheated and are therefore
unlikely to have experienced a significant merging event in their history. The

space, and similarly for a generic pair of rebits, using the 9-dimensional unit
ball. Separability probabilities, could, then, be directly obtained by
integrating the products of these functions (which we numerically estimate and

The coupling between two neighboring potential wells is equivalent to two

62.4 and 200 GeV with results from various models in heavy-ion collisions like
UrQMD, AMPT, and HIJING. We observe that the average <v2> from the transport
model UrQMD agrees well with the measurements at \surd sNN = 9.2 GeV but
increasingly falls short of the experimental <v2> values as the beam energy
increases. The difference in <v2> being of the order of 60% at \surd sNN = 200
GeV. The <v2> results from HIJING is consistent with zero, while those from
AMPT with default settings, a model based on HIJING with additional initial and
final state rescattering effects included, gives a <v2> value of about 4% for
all the beam energies studied. This is in contrast to increase in <v2> with
beam energy for the experimental data. A different version of the AMPT model,
which includes partonic effects and quark coalescence as a mechanism of
hadronization, gives higher values of <v2> among the models studied and is in
agreement with the measured <v2> values at \surd sNN = 200 GeV. These studies
show that the experimental < v2 > has substantial contribution from partonic
interactions at \surd sNN = 200 GeV whose magnitude reduces with decrease in
beam energy. We also compare the available data on the transverse momentum and
pseudorapidity dependence of v2 to those from the above models.

relaxation, an intermediate regime of rather constant creep rate, and a
tertiary regime of accelerated creep towards final failure of the sample. In
the tertiary regime creep rate follows the experimentally observed one over
time-to-failure dependence. The time of minimum strain rate is systematically
observed to be about 60-65 % of the time to failure, in accordance with
experimental observations. In addition, burst size statistics of breaking

steeper decay for the all-time distribution. Statistics of interevent times

functions along the MD trajectories. Though G4-DNA is structurally more stable
than double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), our results strongly suggest that the
potential improvement of the electrical transport properties in the former is
not necessarily related to an increased stability, but rather to the fact that
G4 is able to explore in its conformational space a larger number of
charge-transfer active conformations. This in turn is a result of the
non-negligible interstrand matrix elements, which allow for additional charge
transport pathways. The higher structural stability of G4 can however play an

provides a good foundation for examining whether similar mechanisms are
operating in the atmospheres of Mars and Titan. On Earth, deep convective
clouds in the tropics constitute the upward branch of the Hadley Cell and
provide a conduit through which energy, moisture, momentum, aerosols and
chemical species are moved from the boundary layer to the upper troposphere and
lower stratosphere. This transport produces mid-tropospheric minima in
quantities such as water vapor and moist static energy and maxima where the
clouds detrain. Analogs to this terrestrial transport are found in the strong
and deep thermal circulations associated with topography on Mars and with Mars
dust storms. Observations of elevated dust layers on Mars further support the
notion that non-local deep transport is an important mechanism in the
atmosphere of Mars. On Titan, the presence of deep convective clouds almost
assures that non-local, deep transport is occurring and these clouds may play a
role in global cycling of energy, momentum, and methane. Based on the potential
importance of non-local deep transport in Earth's atmosphere and supported by
evidence for such transport in the atmospheres of Mars and Titan, greater
attention to this mechanism in extraterrestrial atmospheres is warranted.

at small scale is described by using a MHD shell model for velocity field and
magnetic field fluctuations.The shell model allow to study this problem in a
large parameter regime which characterizes the dynamo phenomenon in many
natural systems and which is beyond the power of supercomputers at today. Under
specific conditions of the plasma turbulent state, the field fluctuations at
small scales are able to trigger the dynamo instability. We study this
transition considering the stability curve which shows a strong decrease in the
critical magnetic Reynolds number for increasing inverse magnetic Prandlt
number $\textrm{Pm}^{-1}$ in the range $[10^{-6},1]$ and slows an increase in
the range $[1,10^{8}]$. We also obtain hysteretic behavior across the dynamo
boundary reveling the subcritical nature of this transition. The system,
undergoing this transition, can reach different dynamo regimes, depending on
Reynolds numbers of the plasma flow. This shows the critical role that the
turbulence plays in the dynamo phenomenon. In particular the model is able to
reproduce the dynamical situation in which the large-scale magnetic field jumps

propagator for static gluons in the presence of such anisotropies and the
consequences for quarkonium binding. It has been predicted that the propagator
develops an imaginary part due to Landau damping at high temperature. This
generates a much larger width of quarkonium states than the Appelquist-Politzer

taken from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and Galaxy Evolution Explorer and
combined with new data from the Swift Ultraviolet Optical Telescope to provide
precise photometric measures extending from the Near Infrared to the Far
Ultraviolet. These stars were chosen because they are known to be hot (20,000 <
T_eff < 50,000 K) DA white dwarfs with published Sloan spectra that should be
photometrically stable. This careful selection allows us to compare the
combined photometry and Sloan spectroscopy to models of pure hydrogen
atmospheres to both constrain the underlying properties of the white dwarfs and
test the ability of white dwarf models to predict the photometric measures. We
find that the photometry provides good constraint on white dwarf temperatures,
which demonstrates the ability of Swift/UVOT to investigate the properties of
hot luminous stars. We further find that the models reproduce the photometric
measures in all eleven passbands to within their systematic uncertainties.
Within the limits of our photometry, we find the standard stars to be
photometrically stable. This success indicates that the models can be used to
calibrate additional filters to our standard system, permitting easier
comparison of photometry from heterogeneous sources. The largest source of
uncertainty in the model fitting is the uncertainty in the foreground reddening
curve, a problem that is especially acute in the UV.

untested environmental conditions is crucial to build simulations of breeding
strategies to improve target traits. Although the plant response to
environmental stresses is characterized by both architectural and functional
plasticity, recent attempts to integrate biological knowledge into genetics
models have mainly concerned specific physiological processes or crop models
without architecture, and thus may prove limited when studying genotype x
environment interactions. Consequently, this paper presents a simulation study
introducing genetics into a functional-structural growth model, which gives
access to more fundamental traits for quantitative trait loci (QTL) detection
and thus to promising tools for yield optimization. Methods: The GreenLab model
was selected as a reasonable choice to link growth model parameters to QTL.
Virtual genes and virtual chromosomes were defined to build a simple genetic
model that drove the settings of the species-specific parameters of the model.
The QTL Cartographer software was used to study QTL detection of simulated
plant traits. A genetic algorithm was implemented to define the ideotype for
yield maximization based on the model parameters and the associated allelic
combination. Key Results and Conclusions: By keeping the environmental factors
constant and using a virtual population with a large number of individuals
generated by a Mendelian genetic model, results for an ideal case could be
simulated. Virtual QTL detection was compared in the case of phenotypic traits
- such as cob weight - and when traits were model parameters, and was found to
be more accurate in the latter case. The practical interest of this approach is
illustrated by calculating the parameters (and the corresponding genotype)
associated with yield optimization of a GreenLab maize model. The paper
discusses the potentials of GreenLab to represent environment x genotype
interactions, in particular through its main state variable, the ratio of
biomass supply over demand.

the hypergeometric inverted-beta family, and have two main attractive features:
heavy tails and computational tractability. The family is a four-parameter
generalization of the normal/inverted-beta prior, and is the natural conjugate
prior for shrinkage coefficients in a hierarchical normal model. Our results
emphasize the usefulness of these heavy-tailed priors in large multiple-testing

governs the ""volume"" associated to each copy of G. The JLO cocycle of AGN's

June 13, 2010 and was associated with an M1.0 class flare. Specifically, we
analyze the formation of the CME EUV bubble and its initial dynamics and
thermal evolution in the low corona using AIA images in three wavelengths (171,
193 and 211 A). We derive the first ultra-high cadence measurements of the
temporal evolution of the CME bubble aspect ratio
(=bubble-height/bubble-radius). Our main result is that the CME formation
undergoes three phases: it starts with a slow self-similar expansion followed
by a fast but short-lived (~ 70 sec) period of strong lateral over-expansion
which essentially creates the CME. Then the CME undergoes another phase of
self-similar expansion until it exits the AIA field of view. During the studied
interval, the CME height-time profile shows a strong, short-lived, acceleration
followed by deceleration. The lateral overexpansion phase coincides with the
deceleration phase. The impulsive flare heating and CME acceleration are
closely coupled. However, the lateral overexpansion of the CME occurs during
the declining phase and is therefore not linked to flare reconnection. In
addition, the multi-thermal analysis of the bubble does not show significant
evidence of temperature change.

electrons) originating from DM annihilations, and determine the pulsar
parameters (spin-down luminosity, distance and characteristic age) that produce
a satisfactory fit to the mock AMS-02 data. It turns out that it is always
possible to mimic a DM signal with pulsars. Although the fit in some cases
requires values of spin-down luminosity and characteristic age different from
those of known pulsars in the ATNF and Fermi-LAT catalogues, these catalogues
are known to be incomplete, and therefore the pulsar interpretation can hardly
be ruled out. We also show that if the positron excess is due to a single
pulsar, it is always possible to find a DM candidate that provides a good fit
to the mock AMS-02 data. The discrimination between the two scenarios will thus
require a better knowledge of the underlying sources, or complementary data.

hole sources, the event horizon of Sgr A*, subtends the largest angular scale
on the sky. It is therefore a prime candidate to study and image plasma
processes in strong gravity and it even allows imaging of the shadow cast by
the event horizon. Recent mm-wave VLBI and radio timing observations as well as
numerical GRMHD simulations now have provided several breakthroughs that put
Sgr A* back into the focus. Firstly, VLBI observations have now measured the
intrinsic size of Sgr A* at multiple frequencies, where the highest frequency
measurements have approached the scale of the black hole shadow. Moreover,
measurements of the radio variability show a clear time lag between 22 GHz and
43 GHz. The combination of size and timing measurements, allows one to actually
measure the flow speed and direction of magnetized plasma at some tens of
Schwarzschild radii. This data strongly support a moderately relativistic
outflow, consistent with an accelerating jet model. This is compared to recent
GRMHD simulation that show the presence of a moderately relativistic outflow
coupled to an accretion flow Sgr A*. Further VLBI and timing observations
coupled to simulations have the potential to map out the velocity profile from
5-40 Schwarzschild radii and to provide a first glimpse at the appearance of a
jet-disk system near the event horizon. Future submm-VLBI experiments would
even be able to directly image those processes in strong gravity and directly
confirm the presence of an event horizon.

narrow forbidden emission lines that are typical of type 2 (obscured) AGNs, but
the long-term optical light curve, obtained from a monitoring campaign over
more than two decades, showed strong variability, apparently ruling out the
presence of heavy obscuration. Here, we present the results from a ~40 ks
XMM-Newton observation of Q2122-444 carried out to shed light on the energetics
of this enigmatic AGN. The X-ray analysis was complemented with ATCA radio data
to assess the possible presence of a jet, and with new NTT/EFOSC2 optical
spectroscopic data to verify the actual absence of a BLR. The higher-quality
optical data revealed the presence of strong and broad Balmer lines that are at
odds with the previous spectral classification of this AGN. The lack of
detection of radio emission rules out the presence of a jet. The X-ray data
combined with simultaneous UV observations carried out by the OM aboard
XMM-Newton confirm that Q2122-444 is a typical type-1 AGN without any

investigate the metal line dependence on N(HI) and QSO luminosity. Low (e.g.

stronger dependence on dv if only the highest neutral hydrogen column density

have higher metallicities than intervening absorbers, with the enhancement
being a function of both dv and N(HI). It is also found that absorbers near
QSOs with lower rest-frame UV luminosities have significantly stronger metal
lines. We speculate that absorbers near to high luminosity QSOs may have had
their star formation prematurely quenched. Finally, we search for the signature
of dust reddening by the PDLAs, based on an analysis of the QSO continuum
slopes relative to a control sample and determine a limit of E(B-V)<0.014 for

distinguishing between proximate and intervening DLAs, and establishes a

suppressed by M_P, the transmission of the Lorentz violation into the Standard
Model is protected by the ratio L_HL^2/M_P^2. A wide scale separation,
L_HL<<M_P, can then make Lorentz-violating terms in the Standard Model sector

well-motivated models can be surprisingly subtle. In fact, we show that
temperature fluctuations at the level predicted by our reionization simulations
do not give rise to detectable signatures in the types of statistics that have
been employed previously. However, because of the aliasing of small-scale
density power to larger scale modes in the line-of-sight Ly-alpha forest power
spectrum, earlier analyses were not sensitive to 3D modes with >~ 30 comoving
Mpc wavelengths -- scales where temperature fluctuations are likely to be
relatively largest. The ongoing Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS)
aims to measure the 3D power spectrum of the Ly-alpha forest, P_F, from a large
sample of quasars in order to avoid this aliasing. We find that physically
motivated temperature models can alter P_F at an order unity level at k <~ 0.1
comoving Mpc^{-1}, a magnitude that should be easily detectable with BOSS.
Fluctuations in the intensity of the ultraviolet background can also alter P_F
significantly. These signatures will make it possible for BOSS to study the
thermal impact of HeII reionization at 2 < z < 3 and to constrain models for
the sources of the ionizing background. Future spectroscopic surveys could
extend this measurement to even higher redshifts, potentially detecting the

spin-one resonances (Z') which have appreciable branching fractions to
electroweak bosons, namely the Higgs and longitudinal W and Z. These resonances
are usually believed to have multi-TeV mass due to electroweak precision
constraints, placing them on the edge of LHC discovery reach. Searching for
them is made particularly challenging because hadronically decaying electroweak
bosons produced at such high energy will appear very similar to QCD jets. In
this work we revisit the possibility of discovering these resonances at the
LHC, taking advantage of recently developed jet substructure techniques. We
make a systematic investigation of substructure performance for the
identification of highly Lorentz-boosted electroweak bosons, which should also
be applicable to more general new physics searches. We then estimate the
model-independent Z' discovery reach for the most promising final-state
channels, and find significant improvements compared to previous analyses. For
modes involving the Higgs, we focus on a light Higgs decaying to b quarks. We
further highlight several other novelties of these searches. In the case that
vertex-based b-tagging becomes inefficient at high p_T, we explore the utility
of a muon-based b-tag, or no b-tag at all. We also introduce the mode Z' -> Zh
-> (invisible)(bb) as a competitive discovery channel.

key target of the LISA mission), the community needs efficient methods for
computation of the gravitational self-force (SF) on the Kerr spacetime. Here we
further develop a practical `$m$-mode regularization' scheme for SF
calculations, and give details of a first implementation. The key steps in the
method are (i) removal of a singular part of the perturbation field with a
suitable `puncture' to leave a sufficiently regular residual within a finite
worldtube surrounding the particle's worldline, (ii) decomposition in azimuthal
($m$-)modes, (iii) numerical evolution of the $m$-modes in 2+1D with a finite
difference scheme, and (iv) reconstruction of the SF from the mode sum. The
method relies on a judicious choice of puncture, based on the
Detweiler--Whiting decomposition. We give a working definition for the `order'
of the puncture, and show how it determines the convergence rate of the
$m$-mode sum. The dissipative piece of the SF displays an exponentially
convergent mode sum, while the $m$-mode sum for the conservative piece
converges with a power law. In the latter case the individual modal
contributions fall off at large $m$ as $m^{-n}$ for even $n$ and as $m^{-n+1}$
for odd $n$, where $n$ is the puncture order. We describe an $m$-mode
implementation with a 4th-order puncture to compute the scalar-field SF along
circular geodesics on Schwarzschild. In a forthcoming companion paper we extend
the calculation to the Kerr spacetime.

releasing tremendous amounts of energy in the form of gravitational radiation,
and are key sources for both ground- and space-based gravitational-wave
detectors. The black-hole merger dynamics and the resulting gravitational
waveforms can only be calculated through numerical simulations of Einstein's
equations of general relativity. For many years, numerical relativists
attempting to model these mergers encountered a host of problems, causing their
codes to crash after just a fraction of a binary orbit could be simulated.
Recently, however, a series of dramatic advances in numerical relativity has
allowed stable, robust black-hole merger simulations. This remarkable progress
in the rapidly maturing field of numerical relativity, and the new
understanding of black-hole binary dynamics that is emerging is chronicled.
Important applications of these fundamental physics results to astrophysics, to

of the properties of the Compton shoulder of the Fe Kalpha emission line in the
toroidal X-ray reprocessor model of Murphy & Yaqoob (2009, MNRAS, 397, 1549).
The model comprehensively covers the Compton-thin to Compton-thick regimes and
we find that the variety of Compton shoulder profiles is greater than that for
both (centrally-illuminated) spherical and disk geometries. Our Monte Carlo
simulations were done with a statistical accuracy that is high enough to
reveal, for the case of an edge-on, Compton-thick torus, a new type of Compton
shoulder that is not present in the spherical or disk geometries. Such a
Compton shoulder is dominated by a narrow back-scattering feature at ~6.24 keV.
Our results also reveal a dependence of the shape of the Compton shoulder (and
its magnitude relative to the Fe Kalpha line core) on the spectral shape of the
incident X-ray continuum. We also show the effects of velocity broadening on
the Fe Kalpha line profile and find that if either the velocity width or
instrument resolution is greater than a FWHM of ~2000 km/s, the Compton
shoulder begins to become blended with the line core and the characteristic
features of the Compton shoulder become harder to resolve. In particular, at a
FWHM of ~7000 km/s the Compton shoulder is NOT resolved at all, its only
signature being a weak asymmetry in the blended line profile. Thus, CCD X-ray
detectors cannot unambiguously resolve the Compton shoulder. Our results are
freely available in a format that is suitable for direct spectral-fitting of
the continuum and line model to real data.

slow when the global variance component is near zero. Our conclusion is that

modestly. In most cases this improvement, while noticeable, is less than what
might be expected, especially compared to the improvements that PX makes
possible for models very similar to those considered here. We give some

has made important contributions to cosmology. A major paradigm shift in
cosmology was brought about by observations of Type Ia supernovae. The notion
that the universe is accelerating has led to several theoretical challenges.
Unfortunately, although high quality supernovae data-sets are being produced,
their statistical analysis leaves much to be desired. Instead of using the data
to directly test the model, several studies seem to concentrate on assuming the
model to be correct and limiting themselves to estimating model parameters and
internal errors. As shown here, the important purpose of testing a cosmological
theory is thereby vitiated.

and whether the sparsest star-forming environments are capable of forming
massive stars. To address this issue, we have observed eight apparently
isolated OB stars in the SMC using HST's Advanced Camera for Surveys. Five of
these objects appear as isolated stars, two of which are confirmed to be
runaways. The remaining three objects are found to exist in sparse clusters,
with <10 companion stars revealed, having masses of 1-4 solar mass. Stochastic
effects dominate in these sparse clusters, so we perform Monte Carlo
simulations to explore how our observations fit within the framework of
empirical, galactic cluster properties. We generate clusters using a simplistic
-2 power-law distribution for either the number of stars per cluster (N_*) or
cluster mass (M_cl). These clusters are then populated with stars randomly
chosen from a Kroupa IMF. We find that simulations with cluster lower-mass
limits of M_cl,lo >20 solar mass and N_*,lo >40 match best with observations of
SMC and Galactic OB star populations. We examine the mass ratio of the
second-most massive and most massive stars (m_max,2/m_max), finding that our
observations all exist below the 20th percentile of our simulated clusters.
However, all of our observed clusters lie within the parameter space spanned by
the simulated clusters, although some are in the lowest 5th percentile
frequency. These results suggest that clusters are built stochastically by
randomly sampling stars from a universal IMF with a fixed stellar upper-mass
limit. In particular, we see no evidence to suggest a m_max - M_cl relation.
Our results may be more consistent with core accretion models of star formation
than with competitive accretion models, and they are inconsistent with the
proposed steepening of the integrated galaxy IMF (IGIMF).

nuclear luminosities of 100 3CR radio galaxies with z<0.3, by modeling and
subtracting the extended emission from the host galaxy. We performed a
multi-wavelength statistical analysis (including optical and radio data) of the
properties of the nuclei following classification of the objects into FRI and
FRII, and LIG (low-ionization galaxies), HIG (high-ionization galaxies) and BLO
(broad-lined objects) using the radio morphology and optical spectra,
respectively. The correlations among near infrared, optical, and radio nuclear
luminosity support the idea that the near infrared nuclear emission of FRIs has
a non-thermal origin. Despite the difference in radio morphology, the
multi-wavelength properties of FRII LIG nuclei are statistically
indistinguishable from those of FRIs, an indication of a common structure of
the central engine. All BLOs show an unresolved near infrared nucleus and a
large near infrared excess with respect to FRII LIGs and FRIs of equal radio
core luminosity. This requires the presence of an additional (and dominant)
component other than the non-thermal light. Considering the shape of their
spectral energy distribution, we ascribe the origin of their near infrared
light to hot circumnuclear dust. A near infrared excess is also found in HIGs,
but their nuclei are substantially fainter than those of BLO. This result
indicates that substantial obscuration along the line-of-sight to the nuclei is
still present at 1.6 micron. Nonetheless, HIGs nuclei cannot simply be
explained in terms of dust obscuration: a significant contribution from light
reflected in a circumnuclear scattering region is needed to account for their
multiwavelength properties.

an error floor at moderate-to-high signal to noise ratios, asymptotically good
codes usually converge further away from channel capacity. In this paper, we
introduce the concept of tuned turbo codes, a family of asymptotically good
hybrid concatenated code ensembles, where asymptotic minimum distance growth
rates, convergence thresholds, and code rates can be traded-off using two
tuning parameters, {\lambda} and {\mu}. By decreasing {\lambda}, the asymptotic
minimum distance growth rate is reduced in exchange for improved iterative
decoding convergence behavior, while increasing {\lambda} raises the asymptotic
minimum distance growth rate at the expense of worse convergence behavior, and
thus the code performance can be tuned to fit the desired application. By
decreasing {\mu}, a similar tuning behavior can be achieved for higher rate
code ensembles.

gauge theories. The anisotropy was originally introduced to localize chiral
fermions. Their continuum limit is of practical interest and it will be shown
that the anisotropy of the gauge couplings plays a crucial role in opening the
phase diagram of the theory to a new phase, that is separated from the others
by a second order phase transition. The mechanism behind this is generic for a
certain class of models, that can be studied with lattice techniques. This
leads to new perspectives for the study of quantum effects of extra dimensions.

reconnection is studied by means of the largest Hall magnetohydrodynamics
simulations to date, with system sizes up to $10^{4}$ ion skin depths
($d_{i}$). It is demonstrated that the plasmoid instability can facilitate the
onset of rapid Hall reconnection, in a regime where the onset would otherwise
be inaccessible because the Sweet-Parker width is significantly above $d_{i}$.
However, the topology of Hall reconnection is not inevitably a single stable
X-point. There exists an intermediate regime where the single X-point topology
itself exhibits instability, causing the system to alternate between a single
X-point geometry and an extended current sheet with multiple X-points produced
by the plasmoid instability. Through a series of simulations with various
system sizes relative to $d_{i}$, it is shown that system size affects the
accessibility of the intermediate regime. The larger the system size is, the
easier it is to realize the intermediate regime. Although our Hall MHD model
lacks many important physical effects included in fully kinetic models, the
fact that a single X-point geometry is not inevitable raises the interesting
possibility for the first time that Hall MHD simulations may have the potential
to realize reconnection with geometrical features similar to those seen in
fully kinetic simulations, namely, extended current sheets and plasmoid
formation.

range ~1-10 x 10^(-8) Msun/y, a variety of explosive outcomes is possible well
before the star reaches the Chandrasekhar mass. These outcomes are surveyed for
a range of white dwarf masses (0.7 - 1.1 Msun), accretion rates (1 - 7 x
10^(-8) Msun/y), and initial white dwarf temperatures (0.01 and 1 Lsun). The
results are particularly sensitive to the convection that goes on during the
last few minutes before the explosion. Unless this convection maintains a
shallow temperature gradient, and unless the density is sufficiently high, the
accreted helium does not detonate. Below a critical helium ignition density,
which we estimate to be 5 - 10 x 10^5 g cm^(-3), either helium novae or helium
deflagrations result. The hydrodynamics, nucleosynthesis, light curves, and
spectra of a representative sample of detonating and deflagrating models are
explored. Some can be quite faint indeed, powered at peak for a few days by the
decay of 48Cr and 48V. Only the hottest, most massive white dwarfs considered
with the smallest helium layers, show reasonable agreement with the light
curves and spectra of common Type Ia supernovae. For the other models,
especially those involving lighter white dwarfs, the helium shell mass exceeds
0.05 Msun and the mass of the 56Ni that is synthesized exceeds 0.01 Msun. These
explosions do not look like ordinary Type Ia supernovae, or any other
frequently observed transient.

out a series of binary population synthesis calculations and considered two
treatment of common envelope (CE) evolution, i.e. $\alpha$-formalism and
$\gamma$-algorithm. We found that the evolution of birth rate of these peculiar
SNe Ia is heavily dependent on how to treat the CE evolution. The over-luminous
SNe Ia may only occur for $\alpha$-formalism with low CE ejection efficiency
and the delay time of the SNe Ia is between 0.4 and 0.8 Gyr. The upper limit of
the contribution rate of the supernovae to all SN Ia is less than 0.3%. The
delay time of sub-luminous SNe Ia from equal-mass DD systems is between 0.1 and
0.3 Gyr for $\alpha$-formalism with $\alpha=3.0$, while longer than 9 Gyr for
$\alpha=1.0$. The range of the delay time for $\gamma$-algorithm is very wide,
i.e. longer than 0.22 Gyr, even as long as 15 Gyr. The sub-luminous SNe Ia from
equal-mass DD systems may only account for no more than 1% of all SNe Ia
observed. The super-Chandrasekhar mass model of Chen & Li (2009) may account
for a part of 2003fg-like supernovae and the equal-mass DD model developed by
Pakmor et al. (2010) may explain some 1991bg-like events, too. In addition,
based on the comparison between theories and observations, including the birth
rate and delay time of the 1991bg-like events, we found that the
$\gamma$-algorithm is more likely to be an appropriate prescription of the CE
evolution of DD systems than the $\alpha$-formalism if the equal-mass DD
systems is the progenitor of 1991bg-like SNe Ia.

functions (SFs) of RM are presented for selected areas, and maps of SF
amplitude and slope across the sky are compared with H-alpha intensity and

correlated with length of the line of sight through the Galaxy, with a
contribution from local structures. The slope of the SFs is less concentrated
to the Galactic plane and less correlated with length of the line of sight
through the Galaxy, suggesting a more local origin for RM structure on angular
scales ~ 10 degrees. The RM variance is a factor ~2 higher towards the SGP than
towards the NGP, reflecting a more wide-spread asymmetry between the northern

synchrotron emission at latitudes < 30 degrees can be explained largely by
Faraday dispersion related to small-scale variance in RM, but the errors allow
a significant contribution from differential Faraday rotation along the line of

shown to be impossible for local hidden variable theories. Axiom IV, together

superconductor La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ is very inhomogeneous due to Sr-dopant
induced disorder. On the other hand, until recently it is widely believed that
the hole distribution in HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$ and
Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ doped by interstitial oxygen is much more
uniform. Recent nuclear magnetic resonance measurements indicate, however, that
the charge inhomogeneity in HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$ is close to that in
La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$. Calculations performed in the present paper confirm
this observation. We also show that the charge inhomogeneity is most pronounced
at the surface layer that can be probed by scanning tunneling microscope. Our
simulations demonstrate that, despite having similar amplitudes of charge
inhomogeneity, the hole mean free path in HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$ is
substantially longer than that in La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$. The screening of
Coulomb repulsion in HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$ is also stronger. These two
reasons might explain the difference in superconducting critical temperatures
between these two compounds.

contributions which are associated with the hard and soft rescattering
respectively. Motivated by a very active experimental form factor program at
intermediate values of momentum transfers, $Q^{2}\sim 5-15 \text{GeV}^{2}$,
where an understanding in terms of only a hard rescattering mechanism cannot
yet be expected, we investigate in this work the soft rescattering contribution
using soft collinear effective theory (SCET). Within such description, the form
factor is characterized, besides the hard scale $Q^2$, by a semi-hard scale $Q
\Lambda$, which arises due to presence of soft spectators, with virtuality
$\Lambda^2$ ($\Lambda \sim 0.5$ GeV), such that $Q^{2}\gg Q\Lambda\gg
\Lambda^{2}$. We show that in this case a two-step factorization can be
successfully carried out using the SCET approach. In a first step (SCET$_I$),
we perform the leading order matching of the QCD electromagnetic current onto
the relevant SCET$_I$ operators and perform a resummation of large logarithms
using renormalization group equations. We then discuss the further matching
onto a SCET$_{II}$ framework, and propose the complete factorization formula

also present a qualitative discussion of the phenomenological consequences of

was previously shown, high-order information on these amplitudes can be
obtained from a nonperturbative formula, due to Affleck et al., for the
imaginary part of the QED effective lagrangian in a constant field. The
procedure uses Borel analysis and leads, under some plausible assumptions, to a
number of nontrivial predictions already at the three-loop level. Their direct
verification would require a calculation of this `Euler-Heisenberg lagrangian'

planets in habitable zones, focusing on duration of dynamo activity to generate
their intrinsic magnetic fields, which may be one of key factors in
habitability on the planets. In particular, we are concerned with super-Earths,
observations of which are rapidly developing. We calculated evolution of
temperature distributions in planetary interior, using Vinet equations of
state, Arrhenius-type formula for mantle viscosity, and the astrophysical
mixing length theory for convective heat transfer modified for mantle
convection. After calibrating the model with terrestrial planets in the Solar
system, we apply it for 0.1--$10M_{\oplus}$ rocky planets with surface
temperature of $300~\mbox{K}$ (in habitable zones) and the Earth-like
compositions. With the criterion for heat flux at the CMB (core-mantle
boundary), the lifetime of the magnetic fields is evaluated from the calculated
thermal evolution. We found that the lifetime slowly increases with the
planetary mass ($M_p$) independent of initial temperature gap at the
core-mantle boundary ($\Delta T_{\rm CMB}$) but beyond a critical value
$M_{c,p}$ ($\sim O(1)M_{\oplus}$) it abruptly declines by the mantle viscosity
enhancement due to the pressure effect. We derived $M_{c,p}$ as a function of
$\Delta T_{\rm CMB}$ and a rheological parameter (activation volume, $V^*$).
Thus, the magnetic field lifetime of super-Earths with $M_p > M_{p,c}$
sensitively depends on $\Delta T_{\rm CMB}$, which reflects planetary
accretion, and $V^*$, which has uncertainty at very high pressure. More
advanced high-pressure experiments and first-principle simulation as well as
planetary accretion simulation are needed to discuss habitability of

minimizing finite automata. Getting a minimal automaton is a fundamental issue
in the use and implementation of finite automata tools in frameworks like text
processing, image analysis, linguistic computer science, and many other
applications. There are two main families of minimization algorithms. The first
by a sequence of refinements of a partition of the set of states, the second by
a sequence of fusions or merges of states. Hopcroft's and Moore's algorithms
belong to the first family, the linear-time minimization of acyclic automata of
Revuz belongs to the second family.
  One of our studies is upon the comparison of the nature of Moore's and
Hopcroft's algorithms. This gives some new insight in both algorithms. As we
shall see, these algorithms are quite different both in behavior and in
complexity. In particular, we show that it is not possible to simulate the
computations of one of the algorithm by the other. We describe the minimization
algorithm by fusion for so-called local automata. A special case of
minimization is the construction o minimal automata for finite sets. We
consider briefly this case, and in particular describe incremental algorithms.
Finally, we consider the case of updating a minimal automaton when a word is
added or removed from the set it recognizes.

length $n$ to $d$ (qu)bits, typically $d\ll n$, such that given any string $y$

Classical fingerprinting schemes cannot hide information very well: a classical
fingerprint of $x$ that guarantees error at most $\epsilon$ necessarily reveals
$\Omega(\log(1/ epsilon))$ bits about $x$. We call a scheme hiding if it
reveals $o(\log(1/\epsilon))$ bits; accordingly, no classical scheme is hiding.
For any constant $c$, we construct two kinds of hiding fingerprinting schemes,
both mapping $n$-bit strings to $O(\log n)$ qubits and guaranteeing one-sided
error probability at most $1/n^c$. The first kind uses pure states and leaks at
most O(1) bits, and the second kind uses mixed states and leaks at most $1/n^c$
bits, where the ""leakage"" is bounded via accessible information. The schemes
are computationally efficient. Our mixed-state scheme is optimal, as shown via
a generic strategy that extracts $1/\poly(n)$ bits from any fingerprint over

radiation of the single air shower electrons and positrons, the calculation of

present a revised implementation in REAS3, which incorporates the missing radio

emission contributions, the structure of the simulated radio pulses changes
from unipolar to bipolar, and the azimuthal emission pattern becomes nearly
symmetric. Remaining asymmetries can be explained by radio emission due to the
variation of the net charge excess in air showers, which is automatically taken
into account in the new implementation. REAS3 constitutes the first

radio-loud quasars and measure their 330MHz to 1.4GHz spectral indexes.
Following previous authors we take the spectral index as an indicator of the
orientation towards the quasars with more pole-on sources having flatter
spectral indexes. We use this proxy for orientation to investigate the effect
observing angle may have on optical spectra.
  Quasars with flatter spectral indexes tend to be brighter. However, we find
no indication of reddening in steep-spectrum objects to indicate obscuration by
a torus as a possible explanation. Nor do we find increased redddening in the
flat-spectrum sources which could imply a contribution from jet-related
emission.
  We reproduce a previously-described anti-correlation between the width of the
MgII line and radio spectral index indicating a disk-like geometry for the MgII
BLR. In contrast to previous authors we find no such correlation for the CIV
line suggesting a more isotropic high-ionisation BLR.
  Both the [OII] and [OIII] narrow lines have more flux in steep spectrum
sources while the [OII]/[OIII] flux ratio is lower in these sources. To
describe both of these effects we propose a simple geometric model in which the
NLR exists primarily on the surface of optically thick clouds facing the active
nucleus and the NLR is stratified such that higher-ionisation lines are found
preferentially closer to the nucleus.
  Quantitatively we find that orientation may effect the observed strength of
narrow lines, as well as ratios between lines, by a factor of ~2. These
findings have implications for the use of narrow emission lines to estimate
bolometric luminosities, as well as comparisons between narrow line luminosity
functions for type 1s and type 2s, and the potential of emission-line
diagnostic diagrams as an accurate tool with which to distinguish classes of
AGN.

first reduce the replacement matrix to a block upper triangular one, where the
diagonal blocks are either irreducible or the scalar zero. The scalings for the
color counts are then given inductively depending on the Perron-Frobenius
eigenvalues of the irreducible diagonal blocks. In the second step of the

provided by lower-dimensional background brane defects in a D3-brane Universe,
whose density is a free parameter to be constrained phenomenologically. Such
constraining can be provided by high energy gamma-ray photon tests, including
ultra-high energy/infrared photon-photon scattering. In the second part, I
analyze the currently available data from MAGIC and FERMI Telescopes on delayed
cosmic photon arrivals in this context. It is understood of course that
conventional Astrophysics source effects, which currently are far from being
understood, might be the dominant reason for the observed delayed arrivals. I
also discuss how the stringent constraints from studies of
synchrotron-radiation from distant Nebulae, absence of cosmic birefringence and
non observation of ultra-high-energy cosmic photons can be accommodated within
the aforementioned stringy space-time foam model. I argue that, at least within
the currently available sets of astrophysical data, the stringy foam model can
avoid all theses constraints in a natural range of the string coupling and mass
scale. The key features are: (i) transparency of the foam to electrons and
charged probes in general, (ii) absence of birefringence effects and (iii) a
breakdown of the local effective lagrangian formalism. However, in order to
accommodate, in this theoretical framework, the data of the FERMI satellite on
the delayed arrival of photons from the short intense Gamma Ray Burst GRB
090510, in a way consistent with the findings of the MAGIC telescope, a non
uniform density of brane foam defects must be invoked.

STPRs for different sets of stopping-power data for water and air recommended
by the International Commission on Radiation Units & Measurements (ICRU) are
compared, including also the recently revised data for water, yielding
deviations up to 2% in the plateau region. In comparison, the influence of the
secondary particle spectra on the STPR is about two orders of magnitude smaller
in the whole region up till the practical range. The gained insights enable us
to propose an analytic approximation for the STPR for both pristine and SOBPs
as a function of penetration depth, which parametrically depend only on the

model as a one dimensional Rouse chain confined at both the ends. The bubble is

This simple model effectively reproduces the autocorrelation function for the

Although our model is mathematically similar to the one proposed by Chatterjee

coordinate description by incorporating the chain dynamics through a confined
Rouse chain and thus considers the collective nature of the dynamics. Our model
also shows that the autocorrelation function is very sensitive to the
relaxation times of the normal modes of the chain, which is obvious since the
fluctuation dynamics of the bubble has the contribution from the different
normal modes of the chain.

development kinetics of the 'Stranski-Krastanow' island type morphology. The
anisotropic surface free energy and the surface stiffness were treated with
well accepted trigonometric functions. Although, various tilt angles and
anisotropy constants were considered during simulations, the main emphasis was
given on the effect of rotational symmetries associated with the surface
Helmholtz free energy topography in 2D space. Our computer simulations revealed
the formation of an extremely thin wetting layer during the development of the
bell-shaped Stranski-Krastanow island through the mass accumulation at the
central region of the droplet via surface drift-diffusion. In the strong
(anomalous) anisotropy constant domain, we demonstrated the existence of two
distinct morphological modes: i) the complete stability of the initial
Cosine-shaped droplet just above a certain anisotropy constant threshold level
by spontaneous slight readjustments of the base and the height of the cluster;
ii) the Frank-van der Merwe mode of thin film formation for very large values
of the anisotropy constant by the spreading and coalescence of the droplets
over the substrate surface. During the course of the simulations, we have
continuously tracked both the morphology (i.e., the peak height, the extension

stars, but is not fully explained. Several empirical prescriptions have been
proposed, trying to express the mass-loss rate (Mdot) as a function of
fundamental stellar parameters (mass, luminosity, effective temperature). Our
goal is to test whether the de Jager et al. (1988) prescription, used in some
stellar evolution models, is still valid in view of more recent mass-loss
determinations. By considering 40 Galactic RSGs presenting an infrared excess
and an IRAS 60-mu flux larger than 2 Jy, and assuming a gas-to-dust mass ratio
of 200, it is found that the de Jager rate agrees within a factor 4 with most
Mdot estimates based on the 60-mu signal. It is also in agreement with 6 of the
only 8 Galactic RSGs for which Mdot can be measured more directly through
observations of the circumstellar gas. The two objects that do not follow the
de Jager prescription (by an order of magnitude) are mu Cep and NML Cyg. We
have also considered the RSGs of the Magellanic Clouds. Thanks to the works of
Groenewegen et al. (2009) and Bonanos et al. (2010), we find that the RSGs of
the SMC have Mdots consistent with the de Jager rate scaled by
(Z/Zsun)**(alpha), where Z is the metallicity and alpha is 0.7. The situation
is less clear for the LMC RSGs. In particular, for luminosties larger than
1.6E+05 Lsun, one finds numerous RSGs (except WOH-G64) having Mdot
significantly smaller than the de Jager rate, and indicating that Mdot would no
longer increase with L. Before this odd situation is confirmed through further
analysis of LMC RSGs, we suggest to keep the de Jager prescription unchanged at
solar metallicity in the stellar evolutionary models and to apply a
(Z/Zsun)**0.7 dependence.

contaminate the flow field. These oscillations force the use of an excessive

10^{24} erg/s and 2.7 x 10^{23} erg/s. These are well above the Jovian value
(at 40 MHz) of 2 x 10^{18} erg/s. The motivation for these observations was
that the planetary magnetospheric emission is driven by a stellar
wind-planetary magnetosphere interaction so that the planetary luminosity would
be elevated. Near periastron, HD 80606b might be as much as 3000 times more
luminous than Jupiter. Recent transit observations of HD 80606b provide
stringent constraints on the planetary mass and radius, and, because of the
planet's highly eccentric orbit, its rotation period is likely to be
""pseudo-synchronized"" to its orbital period, allowing a robust estimate of the
former. We are able to make robust estimates of the emission frequency of the
planetary magnetospheric emission and find it to be around 60--90 MHz. We
compare HD 80606b to other high-eccentricity systems and assess the detection
possibilities for both near-term and more distant future systems. Of the known
high eccentricity planets, only HD 80606b is likely to be detectable, as HD
20782B b and HD 4113b are both likely to have weaker magnetic field strengths.
Both the forthcoming ""EVLA low band"" system and the Low Frequency Array may be
able to improve upon our limits for HD 80606b, and do so at a more optimum
frequency. If the low-frequency component of the Square Kilometre Array

noise limits, they should be able to detect an HD 80606b-like planet, unless
the planet's luminosity increases by substantially less than a factor of 3000.

with and without exoplanets are compared to determine how such a scenario,
which relates the lithium abundances and the rotational history of the star,
can be further challenged by observations of solar-like oscillations. Methods:
Based on observations of rotational periods of solar-type stars, slow rotators
on the zero age main sequence (ZAMS) are modelled with a comprehensive
treatment of only the shellular rotation, while fast rotators are modelled
including both shellular rotation and magnetic fields. Assuming a possible link
between low rotation rates on the ZAMS and the presence of planets as a result
of a longer disc-locking phase during the pre-main sequence (PMS), we compare
the surface abundances and asteroseismic properties of slow and fast rotating
models, which correspond to exoplanet-host stars and stars without detected
planets, respectively. Results: We confirm previous suggestions that the
difference in the lithium content of stars with and without detected planets
can be related to their different rotational history. The larger efficiency of
rotational mixing predicted in exoplanet-host stars explains their lithium
depletion and also leads to changes in the structure and chemical composition
of the central stellar layers. Asteroseismic observations can reveal these
changes and can help us distinguish between different possible explanations for

Stripe 82. The quasar catalogue was matched with the Light Motion Curve
Catalogue for SDSS Stripe 82 and individual first-order structure functions
were computed. The structure functions are used to create a variability
indicator that is related to the same intrinsic timescales for all quasars (1
to 2 yr in the rest frame). We study the variability ratios for adjacent SDSS
filter bands as a function of redshift. While variability is almost always
stronger in the bluer passband compared to the redder, the variability ratio
depends on whether strong emission lines contribute to either one band or the
other. The variability ratio-redshift relations resemble the corresponding
colour index-redshift relations. From the comparison with Monte Carlo
simulations of variable quasar spectra we find that the observed variability
ratio-redshift relations are closely fitted assuming that (a) the r.m.s.
fluctuation of the quasar continuum follows a power law-dependence on the
intrinsic wavelength with an exponent -2 (i.e., bluer when brighter) and (b)
the variability of the emission line flux is only about 10% of that of the
underlying continuum. These results, based upon the photometry of more than
8000 quasars, confirm the previous findings by Wilhite et al. (2005) from 315
quasars with repeated SDSS spectroscopy. Finally, we find that quasars with
unusual spectra and weak emission lines tend to have less variability than
conventional quasars. This trend is opposite to what is expected from the
dilution effect of variability due to line emission and may be indicative of
high Eddington ratios in these unconventinal quasars.

particle acceleration and transport in the solar atmosphere. Any observed X-ray
flux from on-disc sources is composed of direct emission plus Compton
backscattered photons (albedo). This affects both the observed spectra and
images as well as the physical quantities derived from them such as the spatial
and spectral distributions of accelerated electrons or characteristics of the
solar atmosphere. Aims: We propose a new indirect method to measure albedo and
to infer the directivity of X-rays in imaging using RHESSI data. Methods:
Visibility forward fitting is used to determine the size of a disc event
observed by RHESSI as a function of energy. This is compared to the sizes of
simulated sources from a Monte Carlo simulation code of photon transport in the
chromosphere for different degrees of downward directivity and true source
sizes to find limits on the true source size and the directivity. Results: The
observed full width half maximum of the source varies in size between 7.4
arcsec and 9.1 arcsec with the maximum between 30 and 40 keV. Such behaviour is
expected in the presence of albedo and is found in the simulations. A source
size smaller than 6 arcsec is improbable for modest directivities and the true
source size is likely to be around 7 arcsec for small directivities.
Conclusions: While it is difficult to image the albedo patch directly, the
effect of backscattered photons on the observed source size can be estimated.
The increase in source size caused by albedo has to be accounted for when
computing physical quantities that include the size as a parameter such as
flare energetics. At the same time, the study of the albedo signature provides
vital information about the directivity of X-rays and related electrons.

modified version of the Gram matrix. The advantage is due to the fact that the
outer products of density operators are replaced by inner product, with a
considerable dimensionality reduction. At the limit, in quantum optical
communications the density operators have infinite dimensions, whereas the

scarce and are virtually non-existent for long-distance group motion within a
natural setting because of the associated technological difficulties. Here we
present results of experiments in which track logs of homing pigeons flying in
flocks of up to 10 individuals have been obtained by high-resolution
lightweight GPS devices and analyzed using a variety of correlation functions
inspired by approaches common in statistical physics. We find a well-defined
hierarchy among flock members from data concerning leading roles in pairwise
interactions, defined on the basis of characteristic delay times between birds'
directional choices. The average spatial position of a pigeon within the flock
strongly correlates with its place in the hierarchy, and birds respond more
quickly to conspecifics perceived primarily through the left eye - both results
revealing differential roles for birds that assume different positions with
respect to flock-mates. From an evolutionary perspective, our results suggest
that hierarchical organisation of group flight may be more efficient than an
egalitarian one, at least for those flock sizes that permit regular pairwise
interactions among group members, during which leader-follower relationships

the bulk or from the surface of the nucleon density distributions, according to
the mean-field models of nuclear structure, and find that it depends on the
stiffness of the nuclear symmetry energy. The bulk contribution to NST arises
from an extended sharp radius of neutrons, whereas the surface contribution
arises from different widths of the neutron and proton surfaces. Nuclear models
where the symmetry energy is stiff, as typical relativistic models, predict a
bulk contribution in NST of 208Pb about twice as large as the surface
contribution. In contrast, models with a soft symmetry energy like common
nonrelativistic models predict that NST of 208Pb is divided similarly into bulk
and surface parts. Indeed, if the symmetry energy is supersoft, the surface
contribution becomes dominant. We note that the linear correlation of NST of
208Pb with the density derivative of the nuclear symmetry energy arises from
the bulk part of NST. We also note that most models predict a mixed-type
(between halo and skin) neutron distribution for 208Pb. Although the halo-type
limit is actually found in the models with a supersoft symmetry energy, the
skin-type limit is not supported by any mean-field model. Finally, we compute
parity-violating electron scattering in the conditions of the 208Pb parity
radius experiment (PREX) and obtain a pocket formula for the parity-violating
asymmetry in terms of the parameters that characterize the shape of the 208Pb
nucleon densities.

quantum space-time foam models inspired from String/Brane theories, provided by
studies of high energy Photons from intense celestial sources, such as Active
Galactic Nuclei or Gamma Ray Bursts. The theoretical models predict
modifications to the radiation dispersion relations, which are quadratically
suppressed by the string mass scale, and time delays in the arrival times of
photons (assumed to be emitted more or less simultaneously from the source),
which are proportional to the photon energy, so that the more energetic photons
arrive later. Although the astrophysics at the source of these energetic
photons is still not understood, and such non simultaneous arrivals, that have
been observed recently, might well be due to non simultaneous emission as a
result of conventional physics effects, nevertheless, rather surprisingly, the
observed time delays can also fit excellently the stringy space-time foam
scenarios, provided the space-time defect foam is inhomogeneous. The key
features of the model, that allow it to evade a plethora of astrophysical
constraints on Lorentz violation, in sharp contrast to other field-theoretic
Lorentz-violating models of quantum gravity, are: (i) transparency of the foam
to electrons and in general charged matter, (ii) absence of birefringence
effects and (iii) a breakdown of the local effective lagrangian formalism.

fish. The PTWA model (Persistent Turning Walker with Alignment) describes the
displacements of agents which modify their curvature in order to align with
their neighbors. The derivation of its macroscopic limit uses the non-classical
notion of generalized collisional invariant. The macroscopic limit of the PTWA
model involves two physical quantities, the density and the mean velocity of
individuals. It is a system of hyperbolic type but is non-conservative due to a
geometric constraint on the velocity. This system has the same form as the
macroscopic limit of the Vicsek model (the 'Vicsek hydrodynamics') but for the
expression of the model coefficients. The numerical computations show that the

lattice. All bonds of each tree can be oriented uniquely with respect to an
arbitrary chosen site called the root. The problem of predecessors is finding
the probability that a path along the oriented bonds passes sequentially fixed
sites $i$ and $j$. The conformal field theory for the Potts model predicts the
fractal dimension of the path to be 5/4. Using this result, we show that the
probability in the predecessors problem for two sites separated by large
distance $r$ decreases as $P(r) \sim r^{-3/4}$. If sites $i$ and $j$ are
nearest neighbors on the square lattice, the probability $P(1)=5/16$ can be
found from the analytical theory developed for the sandpile model. The known
equivalence between the loop erased random walk (LERW) and the directed path on
the spanning tree says that $P(1)$ is the probability for the LERW started at
$i$ to reach the neighboring site $j$. By analogy with the self-avoiding walk,
$P(1)$ can be called the return probability. Extensive Monte-Carlo simulations
confirm the theoretical predictions.

of positive iid random variables in the basin of attraction of an alpha-stable
law, 0<alpha<1. We may think of x as a trap, and tau_x as the depth of the trap
at x. We are interested in the trap process, namely the process that associates
to time t the depth of the currently visited trap. Our first result is the
convergence of the law of that process under suitable scaling. The limit
process is given by the jumps of a certain alpha-stable subordinator at the
inverse of another alpha-stable subordinator, correlated with the first
subordinator. For that result, the requirements for the embedded random walk
are a) the validity of a law of large numbers for its range, and b) the slow
variation at infinity of the tail of the distribution of its time of return to
the origin: they include all transient random walks as well as all planar
random walks, and also many one dimensional random walks. We then derive aging
results for the process, namely scaling limits for some two-time correlation
functions thereof, a strong form of which requires an assumption of transience,
stronger than a, b. The above mentioned scaling limit result is an averaged
result with respect to tau. Under an additional condition on the size of the
intersection of the ranges of two independent copies of the embeddded random
walk, roughly saying that it is small compared with the size of the range, we
derive a stronger scaling limit result, roughly stating that it holds in
probability with respect to tau. With that additional condition, we also
strengthen the aging results, from the averaged version mentioned above, to
convergence in probability with respect to tau.

$\cos(2\phi)$ asymmetry in deep inelastic lepton-nucleon scattering. Our
approach is based on the following observations. First, unlike the production
cross sections, the ratio $R(x,Q^2)=F_L/F_T$ and the azimuthal $\cos(2\phi)$
asymmetry in heavy-quark leptoproduction are sufficiently stable, both
parametricallly and perturbatively, in a wide region of variables $x$ and $Q^2$
within the fixed-flavor-number scheme of QCD. Second, both these quantities,
$R(x,Q^2)=F_L/F_T$ and $\cos(2\phi)$ asymmetry, are sensitive to resummation of
the mass logarithms of the type $\alpha_{s}\ln\left(Q^{2}/m^{2}\right)$ within
the variable-flavor-number schemes. These two facts together imply that the
heavy-quark densities in the nucleon can, in principle, be determined from
high-$Q^2$ data on the Callan-Gross ratio and/or the azimuthal asymmetry in
heavy-quark leptoproduction. In particular, the charm content of the proton can
be measured in future studies at the proposed Large Hadron-Electron (LHeC) and

exponential type orbitals (ETOs). Their radial nodes are shown to be essential
in obtaining accurate nuclear shielding tensors for NMR work. The present work
builds on a 2003 French PhD and many numerical results were published by 2007.
The improvements in this paper are noteworthy, the key being the actual basis
function choice.
  Until 2008, their products on different atoms were difficult to manipulate
for the evaluation of two-electron integrals. Coulomb resolutions provide an
excellent approximation that reduces these integrals to a sum of one-electron
overlap-like integral products that each involve orbitals on at most two
centers. Such two-center integrals are separable in prolate spheroidal
co-ordinates. They are thus readily evaluated. Only these integrals need to be
re-evaluated to change basis functions.
  In this paper, a review of the translation procedures for Slater type
orbitals (STO) and for Coulomb Sturmians follows that of the more recent
application to ETOs of a particularly convenient Coulomb resolution.

at low magnetic field edge of the plateaus is elucidated by means of

sources. We detect 225 X-ray sources, of which 85% are confidently identified

260 pc and 600 pc, are used in the paper. Supposing the X-ray luminosity
function to be universal, it supports a 600 pc distance as a lower limit for
W40 and a total population of at least 600 stars down to 0.1 Mo under the
assumption of a coeval population with a uniform obscuration. In fact, there is
strong spatial variation in Ks-band-excess disk fraction and non-uniform
obscuration due to a dust lane that is identified in absorption in optical,

includes the molecular core within W40. In contrast to the likely ongoing star
formation in the dust lane, the molecular core is inactive. The star cluster

segregation down to 1.5 Mo. However, other cluster properties, including a

of our approach provides a method to study the effect of {\em any} type of
impurity or defect on spin-transport. Furthermore we find that the spin-mix
amplitude in silicon does not follow the $E_g^{-2}$ band gap dependence usually
assigned to III-V semiconductors but follows a much weaker and opposite
$E_g^{0.67}$ dependence. This dependence should be taken into account when
constructing silicon spin transport models.

graphs; in non-perturbative QCD, by refining the lattice. Here we observe that
in quantum gravity the two procedures may well be the same. We outline the
combinatorial structure of spinfoam quantum gravity, define the continuum
limit, and show that under general conditions refining foams is the same as
summing over them. The conditions bear on the cylindrical consistency of the
spinfoam amplitudes and on the presence of appropriate combinatorial factors,
related to the implementation of diffeomorphisms invariance. Intuitively, the
sites of the lattice are points of space: these are themselves quanta of the
gravitational field, and thus a lattice discretization is also a Feynman
history of quanta.

colliding test particles has no upper limit in their center of mass frame in
the neighborhood of an extreme Kerr black hole, even if these particles were at
rest at infinity in the infinite past. We call this mechanism the BSW mechanism
or BSW process. The large energy of such particles would generate strong
gravity, although this has not been taken into account in the BSW analysis. A
similar mechanism is seen in the collision of two spherical test shells in the
neighborhood of an extreme Reissner-Nordstr\""om black hole. In this paper, in
order to draw some implications concerning the effects of gravity generated by
colliding particles in the BSW process, we study a collision of two spherical
dust shells, since their gravity can be exactly treated. We show that the
energy of two colliding shells in the center of mass frame observable from
infinity has an upper limit due to their own gravity. Our result suggests that
an upper limit also exists for the total energy of colliding particles in the
center of mass frame in the observable domain in the BSW process due the
gravity of the particles.

reactions up to Large Hadron Collider energies in the framework of the
HIJING/BBbar v2.0 model that combines (collinear factorized) pQCD multiple
minijet production with soft longitudinal string excitation and hadronization.
The default vacuum string tension, kappa0 = 1 GeV/fm, is replaced by an
effective power law energy dependent string tension, that increases
monotonically with center-of-mass energy. The exponent 0.06 is found sufficient
to reproduce well the energy dependence of multiparticle observables in RHIC,
Tevatron, as well as recent LHC data. This exponent is found to be only half of
that predicted by the Color Glass Saturation model, lambda(CGC)=0.115, where
gluon fusion multiparticle production mechanisms are assumed. In HIJING/BBbar
v2.0, the rapid growth of central-rapidity density with energy is due to the
interplay of copious minijet production and increasing SCF contributions. The
large (strange)baryon-to-meson ratios measured at Tevatron energies are well
described. A significant enhancement of these ratios is predicted up to the
highest LHC energy (14 TeV). The effect of JJbar loops and SCF on
baryon-anti-baryon asymmetry and its relation to baryon number transport is
also discussed.

contributions to counting rules (Maxwell type theorems) which predict when an
infinite periodic structure would be rigid or flexible while preserving the
periodic pattern, as an engineering type framework, or equivalently, as an
idealized molecular framework. Other work has shown that for finite frameworks,
introducing symmetry modifies the previous general counts, and under some
circumstances this symmetrized Maxwell type count can predict added finite
flexibility in the structure.
  In this paper we combine these approaches to present new Maxwell type counts
for the columns and rows of a modified orbit matrix for structures that have
both a periodic structure and additional symmetry within the periodic cells. In
a number of cases, this count for the combined group of symmetry operations
demonstrates there is added finite flexibility in what would have been rigid
when realized without the symmetry. Given that many crystal structures have
these added symmetries, and that their flexibility may be key to their physical
and chemical properties, we present a summary of the results as a way to
generate further developments of both a practical and theoretic interest.

which allows quantitatively assessing the structural properties of systems
composed of different interacting entities. During the last years, intensive
efforts have been spent on applying network-based concepts also for the
analysis of dynamically relevant higher-order statistical properties of time
series. Notably, many corresponding approaches are closely related with the
concept of recurrence in phase space. In this paper, we review recent
methodological advances in time series analysis based on complex networks, with
a special emphasis on methods founded on recurrence plots. The potentials and
limitations of the individual methods are discussed and illustrated for
paradigmatic examples of dynamical systems as well as for real-world time
series. Complex network measures are shown to provide information about
structural features of dynamical systems that are complementary to those
characterized by other methods of time series analysis and, hence,
substantially enrich the knowledge gathered from other existing (linear as well
as nonlinear) approaches.

occurrence of surface nanobubbles on a hydrophobised silicon substrate for
various different liquid temperatures and gas concentrations, which we
controlled independently. We found that nanobubbles occupy a distinct region of
this phase space, occurring for gas concentrations of approximately 100-110%.
Below the nanobubble phase we did not detect any gaseous formations on the
substrate, whereas micropancakes (micron wide, nanometer high gaseous domains)
were found at higher temperatures and gas concentrations. We moreover find that
supersaturation of dissolved gases is not a requirement for nucleation of
bubbles.

high-frequency returns from the foreign exchange market. This study is based on
six exchange rates forming two triangles: EUR-GBP-USD and GBP-CHF-JPY. It is
shown that the exchange rate return fluctuations for all the pairs considered
are well described by the nonextensive statistics in terms of q-Gaussians.
There exist some small quantitative variations in the nonextensivity
q-parameter values for different exchange rates and this can be related to the
importance of a given exchange rate in the world's currency trade. Temporal
correlations organize the series of returns such that they develop the
multifractal characteristics for all the exchange rates with a varying degree
of symmetry of the singularity spectrum f(alpha) however. The most symmetric
spectrum is identified for the GBP/USD. We also form time series of triangular
residual returns and find that the distributions of their fluctuations develop
disproportionately heavier tails as compared to small fluctuations which
excludes description in terms of q-Gaussians. The multifractal characteristics
for these residual returns reveal such anomalous properties like negative
singularity exponents and even negative singularity spectra. Such anomalous
multifractal measures have so far been considered in the literature in
connection with the diffusion limited aggregation and with turbulence. We find
that market inefficiency on short time scales leads to the occurrence of the
Epps effect on much longer time scales. Although the currency market is much
more liquid than the stock markets and it has much larger transaction
frequency, the building-up of correlations takes up to several hours - time
that does not differ much from what is observed in the stock markets. This may
suggest that non-synchronicity of transactions is not the unique source of the
observed effect.
