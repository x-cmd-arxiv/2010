  Coll., 12-16 July 2010",,,,"astro-ph.HE astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The maximum mass of a neutron star (NS) is poorly defined. Theoretical
attempts to define this mass have thus far been unsuccessful. Observational
results currently provide the only means of narrowing this mass range down.
Eclipsing X-ray binary (XRB) pulsar systems are the only interacting binaries
in which the mass of the NS may be measured directly. Only 10 such systems are
known to exist, 6 of which have yielded NS masses in the range 1.06 - 1.86
M$_{\odot}$.We present the first orbital solutions of two further eclipsing
systems, OAO 1657-415 and EXO 1722-363, whose donor stars have only recently
been identified. Using observations obtained using the VLT/ISAAC NIR
spectrograph, our initial work was concerned with providing an accurate
spectral classification of the two counterpart stars, leading to a consistent
explanation of the mechanism for spin period evolution of OAO 1657-415.
Calculating radial velocities allowed orbital solutions for both systems to be
computed. These are the first accurate determinations of the NS and counterpart
masses in XRB pulsar systems to be made employing NIR spectroscopy.

compare two preprocessing methods presently in use, namely the methods of
Wiegelmann et al. (2006) and Fuhrmann et al. (2007). The two preprocessing
methods were applied to a recently observed vector magnetogram. We examine the
changes in the magnetogram effected by the two preprocessing algorithms.
Furthermore, the original magnetogram and the two preprocessed magnetograms
were each used as input data for nonlinear force-free field extrapolations by
means of two different methods, and we analyze the resulting fields. Both
preprocessing methods managed to significantly decrease the magnetic forces and
magnetic torques that act through the magnetogram area and that can cause
incompatibilities with the assumption of force-freeness in the solution domain.
Both methods also reduced the amount of small-scale irregularities in the
observed photospheric field, which can sharply worsen the quality of the
solutions. For the chosen parameter set, the Wiegelmann et al. method led to
greater changes in strong-field areas, leaving weak-field areas mostly
unchanged, and thus providing an approximation of the magnetic field vector in
the chromosphere, while the Fuhrmann et al. method weakly changed the whole
magnetogram, thereby better preserving patterns present in the original
magnetogram. Both preprocessing methods raised the magnetic energy content of
the extrapolated fields to values above the minimum energy, corresponding to
the potential field. Also, the fields calculated from the preprocessed
magnetograms fulfill the solenoidal condition better than those calculated
without preprocessing.

the Shannon capacity for a class of binary-input memoryless symmetric (BMS)

saturation"" phenomena derived by Kudekar, Richardson and Urbanke. In
particular, it was shown that the belief propagation (BP) threshold of the
spatially coupled codes is equal to the maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoding
threshold of the underlying constituent codes. In this sense, the BP threshold
is saturated to its maximum value. Moreover, it has been empirically observed
that the same phenomena also occurs when transmitting over more general classes
of BMS channels. In this paper, we show that the effect of spatial coupling is
not restricted to the realm of channel coding. The effect of coupling also
manifests itself in compressed sensing. Specifically, we show that
spatially-coupled measurement matrices have an improved sparsity to sampling
threshold for reconstruction algorithms based on verification decoding. For
BP-based reconstruction algorithms, this phenomenon is also tested empirically
via simulation. At the block lengths accessible via simulation, the effect is
quite small and it seems that spatial coupling is not providing the gains one
might expect. Based on the threshold analysis, however, we believe this
warrants further study.

Optical Long-term Investigations of the Sun VSM (Vector Spectromagnetograph)
produces full-disk line-of-sight magnetic flux images deriving from both

investigate key properties of the magnetic field in these two layers using more

12{\deg}, while chromospheric fields expand in all directions to a significant
degree. Using a simple stereoscopic inversion, we find evidence that
photospheric polar fields are also nearly radial but that during 2008 the
chromospheric field in the south pole was expanding superradially. We obtain a
spatially resolved polar photospheric flux distribution up to 80{\deg} latitude
whose strength increases poleward approximately as cosine(colatitude) to the
power 9-10. This distribution would give a polar field strength of 5-6 G. We

propulsive characteristics of swimming microorganisms. When a solid body is
dragged through a viscous fluid at constant velocity, the presence of a wall
increases fluid drag, and thus the net force required to maintain speed has to
increase. In contrast, recent optical trapping experiments have revealed that
the propulsive force generated by human spermatozoa is decreased by the
presence of boundaries. Here, we use a series of simple models to analytically
elucidate the propulsive effects of a solid boundary on passively actuated
filaments and model flagella. For passive flexible filaments actuated
periodically at one end, the presence of the wall is shown to increase the
propulsive forces generated by the filaments in the case of displacement-driven
actuation, while it decreases the force in the case of force-driven actuation.
In the case of active filaments as models for eukaryotic flagella, we
demonstrate that the manner in which a solid wall affects propulsion cannot be
known a priori, but is instead a nontrivial function of the flagellum
frequency, wavelength, its material characteristics, the manner in which the
molecular motors self-organize to produce oscillations (prescribed activity
model or self-organized axonemal beating model), and the boundary conditions
applied experimentally to the tethered flagellum. In particular, we show that
in some cases, the increase in fluid friction induced by the wall can lead to a
change in the waveform expressed by the flagella which results in a decrease in
their propulsive force.

constructing the ensembles in fixed-($m,S$) spaces has been developed.
Numerical calculations show that for BEGOE(2)-$\cs$, the fixed-$(m,S)$ density
of states is close to Gaussian and level fluctuations follow GOE in the dense
limit. For BEGOE(1+2)-$\cs$, generically there is Poisson to GOE transition in
level fluctuations as the interaction strength (measured in the units of the
average spacing of the single particle levels defining the mean-field) is
increased. The interaction strength needed for the onset of the transition is
found to decrease with increasing $S$. Covariances in energy centroids and
spectral variances are analyzed. Propagation formula is derived for the
variance propagator for the fixed-$(m,S)$ ensemble averaged spectral variances.
Variance propagator clearly shows, by applying the Jacquod and Stone
prescription, that the BEGOE(2)-$\cs$ ensemble generates ground states with
spin $S=S_{max}$. This is further corroborated by analyzing the structure of
the ground states in the presence of the exchange interaction $\hat{S}^2$ in
BEGOE(1+2)-$\cs$. Natural spin ordering is also observed with random
interactions. Going beyond these, we also introduce pairing symmetry in the
space defined by BEGOE(2)-$\cs$. Expectation values of the pairing Hamiltonian
show that random interactions exhibit pairing correlations in the ground state
region.

time varying nature of the channel model to align the interference from
different users at the eavesdropper perfectly in a one-dimensional space while
creating a higher dimensionality space for the interfering signals at the

achieve this alignment through signal scaling at the transmitters in our first
scheme (scaling based alignment (SBA)), we let nature provide this alignment
through the ergodicity of the channel coefficients in the second scheme
(ergodic secret alignment (ESA)). For each scheme, we obtain the resulting
achievable secrecy rate region. We show that the secrecy rates achieved by both

i.i.d. Gaussian signaling based schemes with and without cooperative jamming by
showing that the secrecy rates achieved using i.i.d. Gaussian signaling with
cooperative jamming do not scale with SNR. In addition, we introduce an
improved version of our ESA scheme where we incorporate cooperative jamming to

cross-section only depends on the $Z'$ boson mass together with two parameters
$c_u$ and $c_d$. We carefully discuss the experimental cuts that should be
applied and tabulate the theoretical next-to-next-to-leading order corrections
which must be included. Using these results the approach then provides a safe,
convenient and unbiased way of comparing experiment to theoretical models which
avoids any built-in model dependent assumptions. We apply the method to three
classes of perturbative $Z'$ boson benchmark models: $E_6$ models, left-right
symmetric models and sequential standard models. We generalise each class of
model in terms of {mixing angles which continuously parametrize} linear
combinations of pairs of generators and lead to distinctive orbits in the
$c_u-c_d$ plane. We also apply this method to the strongly coupled four-site
benchmark model in which two $Z'$ bosons are predicted. By comparing the
experimental limits or discovery bands to the theoretical predictions on the
$c_u$-$c_d$ plane, we show that the LHC at 7 TeV with integrated luminosity of
500 pb$^{-1}$ will greatly improve on current Tevatron mass limits for the

applications due to the combination of their planar geometry and high quality

both the details of their geometry and the materials and processes that are

resonator performance on materials and geometry as a function of temperature
and excitation power. We measure quality factors greater than $2\times10^6$ at
high excitation power and $6\times10^5$ at a power comparable to that generated
by a single microwave photon circulating in the resonator. We examine the
limits to the high excitation power performance of the resonators and find it
to be consistent with a model of radiation loss. We further observe that while
in all cases the quality factors are degraded as the temperature and power are
reduced due to dielectric loss, the size of this effect is dependent on
resonator materials and geometry. Finally, we demonstrate that the dielectric
loss can be controlled in principle using a separate excitation near the
resonance frequencies of the resonator.

exoplanetary systems in the post-main sequence, perhaps epitomized by the
evidence for surviving rocky planetary bodies at white dwarfs. Coinciding with
the launch of the Spitzer Space Telescope, both space- and ground-based data
have supported a picture whereby asteroid analogs persist at a significant
fraction of cool white dwarfs, and are prone to tidal disruption when passing
close to the compact stellar remnant. The ensuing debris can produce a
detectable infrared excess, and the material gradually falls onto the star,
polluting the atmosphere with heavy elements that can be used to determine the
bulk composition of the destroyed planetary body. Based on the observations to
date, the parent bodies inferred at white dwarfs are best described as
asteroids, and have a distinctly rocky composition similar to material found in
the inner Solar System. Their minimum masses are typical of large asteroids,
and can approach or exceed the mass of Vesta and Ceres, the two largest
asteroids in the Solar System. From the number of stars surveyed in various
studies, the fraction of white dwarfs that host terrestrial planetary system
remnants is at least a few percent, but likely to be in the range 20% to 30%.
Therefore, A- and F-type stars form terrestrial planets efficiently, with a
frequency at least as high as the remnants detected at their white dwarf
descendants.

  To achieve the science goal of constraining the Dark Energy evolution,
stringent requirements are laid down for the design of DECam. Among them, the
flatness of the focal plane needs to be controlled within a 60-micron envelope
in order to achieve the specified PSF variation limit. It is very challenging
to measure the flatness of the focal plane to such precision when it is placed
in a high vacuum dewar at 173 K. We developed two image based techniques to
measure the flatness of the focal plane. By imaging a regular grid of dots on
the focal plane, the CCD offset along the optical axis is converted to the
variation the grid spacings at different positions on the focal plane. After
extracting the patterns and comparing the change in spacings, we can measure
the flatness to high precision. In method 1, the regular dots are kept in high
sub micron precision and cover the whole focal plane. In method 2, no high
precision for the grid is required. Instead, we use a precise XY stage moves
the pattern across the whole focal plane and comparing the variations of the
spacing when it is imaged by different CCDs. Simulation and real measurements
show that the two methods work very well for our purpose, and are in good
agreement with the direct optical measurements.

wreaths of strong toroidal magnetic field at low latitudes, often with opposite

in systems with considerably lower diffusivities, achieved with sub-grid scale
models including a dynamic Smagorinsky treatment of unresolved turbulence. The
lower diffusion promotes the generation of magnetic wreaths that undergo
prominent temporal variations in field strength, exhibiting global magnetic
cycles that involve polarity reversals. In our least diffusive simulation, we

contributing to the cosmic X-ray background (CXRB). However, the AGNs found in
deep X-ray surveys are often too weak to allow direct measurement of the column
density of obscuring matter. One method adopted in recent years to identify
heavily obscured, Compton-thick AGNs under such circumstances is to use the
observed mid-infrared to X-ray luminosity ratio as a proxy for the column
density. This is based on the supposition that the amount of energy lost by the
illuminating X-ray continuum to the obscuring matter and reprocessed into
infrared emission is directly related to the column density and that the proxy
is not sensitive to other physical parameters of the system (aside from
contamination by dust emission from, for example, star-forming regions). Using
Monte Carlo simulations, we find that the energy losses experienced by the
illuminating X-ray continuum in the obscuring matter are far more sensitive to
the shape of the X-ray continuum and to the covering factor of the X-ray
reprocessor than they are to the column density of the material. Specifically
we find that it is possible for the infrared to X-ray luminosity ratio for a
Compton-thin source to be just as large as that for a Compton-thick source even
without any contamination from dust. Since the intrinsic X-ray continuum and
covering factor of the reprocessor are poorly constrained from deep X-ray
survey data, we conclude that the mid-infrared to X-ray luminosity ratio is not
a reliable proxy for the column density of obscuring matter in AGNs even when
there is no other contribution to the mid-infrared luminosity aside from X-ray
reprocessing. This conclusion is independent of the geometry of the obscuring
matter.

The gas is reliably measured to ~R2500, allowing us to place good constraints
on the enclosed mass and baryon fraction (fb) within this radius
(M2500=1.6e12+/-0.2e12 Msun, fb(2500)=0.10+/-0.01; systematic errors are
<~20%). The data indicate that the hot gas is close to hydrostatic, which is
supported by good agreement with a kinematical analysis of the dwarf satellite
galaxies. We confirm a dark matter (DM) halo at ~20-sigma. Assuming an NFW DM
profile, our physical model for the gas distribution enables us to obtain
meaningful constraints at scales larger than R2500, revealing that most of the
baryons are in the hot gas. We find that fb within Rvir is consistent with the
Cosmological value, confirming theoretical predictions that a ~Milky Way-mass
(Mvir=3.1e12+/-0.4e12 Msun) galaxy can sustain a massive, quasi-hydrostatic gas
halo. While fb is higher than the cold baryon fraction typically measured in
similar-mass spiral galaxies, both the gas fraction (fg) and fb in NGC720 are
consistent with an extrapolation of the trends with mass seen in massive galaxy
groups and clusters. After correcting for fg, the entropy profile is close to
the self-similar prediction of gravitational structure formation simulations,
as observed in galaxy clusters. Finally, we find a strong heavy metal abundance
gradient in the ISM similar to those observed in massive galaxy groups.

Quataert to study the optical emission lines produced when a main sequence (MS)
star is tidally disrupted by a supermassive black hole. WDs are tidally
disrupted outside of the event horizon of a $< 10^{5}\msun$ black hole, which
makes these tidal disruption events good signposts of IMBHs. We focus on the
optical and UV emission lines produced when the accretion flare photoionizes
the stream of debris that remains unbound during the disruption. We find that
the spectrum is dominated by lines due to ions of C and O, the strongest of
which are \ion{C}{4} $\lambda$1549 at early times and [\ion{O}{3}]
$\lambda$5007 at later times. Furthermore, we model the profile of the emission
lines in the [\ion{O}{3}] $\lambda\lambda$4959, 5007 doublet and find that it
is highly asymmetric with velocity widths of up to $\sim 2500

Seeking for simplicity, it is assumed that the energy loss due to different

that the drift in a time--varying magnetic field is extremely energetic. The
energy scale widely exceeds the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) cutoff. The
polarization drift in a time--varying electric field is also able to raise the
energy of cosmic rays to an extreme value. It can be compared with the Hillas
mechanism. The drift in a spatially--varying magnetic field is almost as strong
as the polarization drift. The curvature drift in a non--uniform magnetic field
and a vanishing electric field is very weak.

of the differences of the occupied volume (the product of filling factor and
total volume of the shell) in a matter-bounded geometry, which also allows to
reproduce the observed pattern of the extinction. The 8 mi/24 mi ratio is low

this paper, we show that the Floquet operators of periodically driven systems
can be divided into topologically distinct (homotopy) classes, and give a
simple physical interpretation of this classification in terms of the spectra

Floquet operators belong to the trivial class simulate the dynamics generated
by time-independent Hamiltonians, which can be topologically classified
according to the schemes developed for static systems. We demonstrate these

[arXiv:1005.4455], we extended the Arnold-Falk-Winther framework by analyzing
variational crimes (a la Strang) on Hilbert complexes. In particular, this gave
a treatment of finite element exterior calculus on manifolds, generalizing
techniques from surface finite element methods and recovering earlier a priori

extend the Hilbert complex framework in a second distinct direction: to the
study of semilinear mixed problems. We do this, first, by introducing an
operator-theoretic reformulation of the linear mixed problem, so that the
semilinear problem can be expressed as an abstract Hammerstein equation. This
allows us to obtain, for semilinear problems, a priori solution estimates and
error estimates that reduce to the Arnold-Falk-Winther results in the linear
case. We also consider the impact of variational crimes, extending the results
of our previous article to these semilinear problems. As an immediate
application, this new framework allows for mixed finite element methods to be
applied to semilinear problems on surfaces.

In``Y. Hou, I. Gutman and C. Woo, Unicyclic graphs with maximal energy, {\it

$E(P_n^6)$ is maximal within the class of the unicyclic bipartite $n$-vertex

this paper, by utilizing the Coulson integral formula and some knowledge of

show that the energy of $P_n^6$ is greater than that of $C_n$ for $n=8,12,14$

interactions involving P (polar or hydrophilic) monomers are purely repulsive.
The hydrodynamic interactions are found to assist the collapse. Furthermore,
the chain sequence has a strong influence on the kinetics and on the
compactness and energy of the final state. The dynamics is typically
characterised by initial rapid cluster formation, followed by coalescence and
final rearrangement to form the compact globule. The coalescence stage takes
most of the collapse time, and its duration is particularly sensitive to the
details of the architecture. Long blocks of type P are identified as the main

corresponds to the ground state of the Rokhsar-Kivelson quantum dimer model at

exponentially in the RVB, four-spin valence-bond-solid (VBS) correlations are
critical, qualitatively like the well-known dimer-dimer correlations of the

$a=2$ for the CDM). We also compute the distribution of monomer (defect) pair
separations, which decay by a larger exponent in the RVB than in the CDM. We
further study both models in their different winding number sectors and
evaluate the relative weights of different sectors. Like the CDM, all the
observed RVB behaviors can be understood in the framework of a mapping to a
""height"" model characterized by a gradient-squared stiffness constant $K$. Four
independent measurements consistently show a value $K_{RVB} \approx 1.6

anisotropies and an increase in the effective K, both of which can be
understood as a consequence of anharmonic terms in the height-model free

relations on the lattice, fails because the renormalisation group blockings
required to construct a doubler free lattice theory from the continuum are not
invariant under charge conjugation. Correctly taking into account the
transformation of these blockings leads to a modified lattice $\mathcal{CP}$
symmetry for the fermion fields, which, for gauge field configurations with
trivial topology, has a smooth limit to continuum $\mathcal{CP}$ as the lattice

  focal spot","9 pages, 3 figures",,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We observe topography induced spectral shifts using high resolution grating
spectrometers which we attribute to the fact that the focal spot has a finite
size. The topography induced spectral shifts depend on spectrometer grating
orientation and numerical aperture of the microscope objective. This is
demonstrated by spectroscopic imaging trenches in GaAs in directions parallel
and perpendicular the spectrometer entrance slit. Differences along the two
directions of the LO phonon band show that the spectral shift is due to the
variation of the grating angle across the non uniform illuminated focal spot
caused by topography. Alignment errors of the optical axis lead to additional
spectral shifts. Topography induced spectral shifts can be detected by
recording spectra by scanning the sample in two perpendicular orientations with
respect to the spectrometer entrance slit.

opportunistic routing for wireless multihop networks. In multirate anypath
routing, each node uses both a set of next hops and a selected transmission
rate to reach a destination. Using this rate, a packet is broadcast to the
nodes in the set and one of them forwards the packet on to the destination. To
date, there has been no theory capable of jointly optimizing both the set of
next hops and the transmission rate used by each node. We solve this by
introducing two polynomial-time routing algorithms and provide the proof of
their optimality. The proposed algorithms run in roughly the same running time
as regular shortest-path algorithms, and are therefore suitable for deployment
in routing protocols. We conducted measurements in an 802.11b testbed network,

spiking neuron suffices to carry out such an approximation, given a suitable
refractory response. Empirically, we find that the online approximation of
signals with a sum of power-law kernels is beneficial for encoding signals with
slowly varying components, like long-memory self-similar signals. For such
signals, the online power-law kernel approximation typically required less than
half the number of spikes for similar SNR as compared to sums of similar but
exponentially decaying kernels. As power-law kernels can be accurately
approximated using sums or cascades of weighted exponentials, we demonstrate
that the corresponding decoding of spike-trains by a receiving neuron allows
for natural and transparent temporal signal filtering by tuning the weights of

Iberoam., 29 (2013), no. 1, 53-74",,,"math.CA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the theory of singular integral operators significant effort is often
required to rigorously define such an operator. This is due to the fact that
the kernels of such operators are not locally integrable on the diagonal, so
the integral formally defining the operator or its bilinear form is not well
defined (the integrand is not in L^1) even for nice functions. However, since
the kernel only has singularities on the diagonal, the bilinear form is well
defined say for bounded compactly supported functions with separated supports.
  One of the standard ways to interpret the boundedness of a singular integral
operators is to consider regularized kernels, where the cut-off function is
zero in a neighborhood of the origin, so the corresponding regularized
operators with kernel are well defined (at least on a dense set). Then one can
ask about uniform boundedness of the regularized operators. For the standard
regularizations one usually considers truncated operators.
  The main result of the paper is that for a wide class of singular integral
operators (including the classical Calderon-Zygmund operators in
non-homogeneous two weight settings), the L^p boundedness of the bilinear form
on the compactly supported functions with separated supports (the so-called
restricted L^p boundedness) implies the uniform L^p-boundedness of regularized
operators for any reasonable choice of a smooth cut-off of the kernel. If the
kernel satisfies some additional assumptions (which are satisfied for classical
singular integral operators like Hilbert Transform, Cauchy Transform,
Ahlfors--Beurling Transform, Generalized Riesz Transforms), then the restricted
L^p boundedness also implies the uniform L^p boundedness of the classical
truncated operators.

to reproduce the degree distribution found in metabolic networks. This might
suggest that natural selection has had little influence on this particular
network property. We here investigate to what extent other structural network
properties have evolved under selective pressure from the corresponding ones of
the random null model: The clustering coefficient and the assortativity
measures are chosen and it is found that these measures for the metabolic
network structure are close enough to the BW-network so as to fit inside its
reachable random phase space. It is furthermore shown that the use of this null
model indicates an evolutionary pressure towards low assortativity and that
this pressure is stronger for larger networks. It is also shown that selecting
for BW networks with low assortativity causes the BW degree distribution to
slightly deviate from its power-law shape in the same way as the metabolic
networks. This implies that an equilibrium model with fluctuating degree
distribution is more suitable as a null model, when identifying selective
pressures, than a randomized counterpart with fixed degree sequence, since the
overall degree sequence itself can change under selective pressure on other
global network properties.

binary TNO Orcus, we have been able to derive high-precision relative
astrometry and photometry of the Orcus system with respect to background stars.
The RA residuals of an orbital fit to the astrometric data revealed a
periodicity of 9.7+-0.3 days, which is what one would expect to be induced by
the known Orcus companion. The residuals are also correlated with the
theoretical positions of the satellite with regard to the primary. We therefore
have revealed the presence of Orcus' satellite in our astrometric measurements.
The photocenter motion is much larger than the motion of Orcus around the
barycenter, and we show here that detecting some binaries through a carefully
devised astrometric technique might be feasible with telescopes of moderate
size. We also analyzed the system's mid-term photometry to determine whether
the rotation could be tidally locked to the satellite's orbital period. We
found that a photometric variability of 9.7+-0.3 days is clear in our data, and
is nearly coincident with the orbital period of the satellite. We believe this
variability might be induced by the satellite's rotation. There is also a
slight hint for an additional small variability in the 10 hr range that was
already reported in the literature. This short-term variability would indicate
that the primary is not tidally locked and therefore the system would not have
reached a double synchronous state. Implications for the basic physical
properties of the primary and its satellite are discussed. From angular
momentum considerations we suspect that the Orcus satellite might have formed
from a rotational fission. This requires that the mass of the satellite would
be around 0.09 times that of the primary, close to the value that one derives
by using an albedo of 0.12 for the satellite and assuming equal densities for
both objects.

Project can be accurately represented by a small number of basis functions, and
show that the halo expansion (HEX) method provides a way to replay simulations.
We explore the level of accuracy of the technique as well as some of its
limitations. We find that the number of terms included in the expansion must be
large enough to resolve the large-scale distribution and shape of the halo but,
beyond this, additional terms result in little further improvement. Particle
and subhalo orbits can be integrated in this realistic, time-varying halo
potential approximation, at much lower cost than the original simulation, with
high fidelity for many individual orbits, and a good match to the distributions
of orbital energy and angular momentum. Statistically, the evolution of
structural subhalo properties, such as mass, half-mass radius and
characteristic circular velocity, are very well reproduced in the halo
expansion approximation over several gigayears. We demonstrate an application
of the technique by following the evolution of an orbiting subhalo at much
higher resolution than can be achieved in the original simulation. Our method
represents a significant improvement over commonly used techniques based on
static analytical descriptions of the halo potential.

simulate the spectra of the detected sources, in order to address specific
science topics which are unique to WFXT. Among them, we focus on the
characterization of the Intra Cluster Medium (ICM) of high-z clusters, and in

cooling frequency is situated between the optical/UV and X-ray observing bands.
While this scenario describes well the averaged observed properties, some
individual GRB afterglows require different or additional assumptions, such as
the presence of late energy injection. We show that a chromatic break (a break
in the X-ray light curve that is not seen in the optical) is present in the
afterglows of 3 GRBs and demonstrate evidence for chromatic breaks in a further
4 GRBs. The average properties of these breaks cannot be explained in terms of
the passage of the synchrotron cooling frequency through the observed bands,
nor a simple change in the external density. It is difficult to reconcile
chromatic breaks in terms of a single component outflow and instead, more
complex jet structure or additional emission components are required.

important in robot kinematics, and has further applications in structural

uniquely defined given m. Rigid 11-bar linkages, where n=7, are the simplest
planar linkages for which these questions were still open. It will be proven
that the maximal number of assembly modes of such linkages is exactly 56. The
rigidity of a linkage is captured by a polynomial system derived from distance,
or Cayley-Menger, matrices. The upper bound on the number of assembly modes is
obtained as the mixed volume of a 5x5 system. An 11-bar linkage admitting 56

so-called Julia-Toulouse Approach for defects condensation to the SU(2)
restricted gauge theory defined by means of the Cho decomposition of the
non-abelian connection. Cho's geometric construction naturally displays the
topological degrees of freedom of the theory and can be used to put the
Yang-Mills action into an abelianized form under certain conditions. On the
other hand, the use of the Julia-Toulouse prescription to deal with the
monopole condensation leads to an effective action describing the phase whose
dynamics is dominated by the magnetic condensate. The effective theory we found
describes the interaction between external electric currents displaying a
short-range Yukawa interaction plus a linear confinement term that governs the
long distance physics.

explain the exotic orbits of the extra-solar planets, at first sight do not
seem to have played a role in our system. In reality, though, there are several
aspects in the structure of our Solar System that cannot be explained in the
classic scenario of in-situ formation and smooth evolution of the giant

System that emerges from the so-called 'Nice model' and its recent extensions.
The story provided by this model describes a very ""dynamical"" Solar System,
with giant planets affected by both radial migrations and a temporary orbital
instability. Thus, the diversity between our system and those found so far
around other stars does not seem to be due to different processes that operated
here and elsewhere, but rather stems from the strong sensitivity of chaotic
evolutions to small differences in the initial and environmental conditions.

for $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills in four dimensions can be written down
which is gauge invariant, free of fermion doublers and respects one out of a
total of 16 continuum supersymmetries. It is shown how these exact symmetries
together with the large point group symmetry of the lattice strongly constrain
the possible counterterms needed to renormalize the theory and hence determine
how much residual fine tuning will be needed to restore all supersymmetries in
the continuum limit. We report on progress to study these renormalization
effects at one loop. We go on to give examples of applications of these

controls the strength of the first-order phase transition driven by
fluctuations. In the limit of $\lambda_2\to0$, the $U(2)\times U(2)$ theory is
reduced to an $O(8)$ scalar theory that exhibits a second-order phase
transition in three dimensions. We develop a new insight for the understanding
of the fluctuation-induced first-order phase transition as a smooth
continuation from the standard RG flow in the $O(8)$ system. In our view from
the RG flow diagram on coupling parameter space, the region that favors the
first-order transition emerges from the unphysical region to the physical one
as $\lambda_2$ increases from zero. We give this interpretation based on the
Taylor expansion of the functional RG equations up to the fourth order in terms
of the field, which encompasses the $\epsilon$-expansion results. We compare
results from the expansion and from the full numerical calculation and find
that the fourth-order expansion is only of qualitative use and that the
sixth-order expansion improves the quantitative agreement.

surface irregularities and self-similarity structures at different spatial
scales, especially in the range of 1 to 100 nm, are of high importance because
they greatly affect the surface interaction forces acting at a nanoscale
distance. An analytical method for parameterizing the surface irregularities
and their correlations in nanosurfaces imaged by atomic force microscopy (AFM)
is proposed. In this method, flicker noise spectroscopy - a statistical physics
approach - is used to develop six nanometrological parameters characterizing
the high-frequency contributions of jump- and spike-like irregularities into
the surface texture. These contributions reflect the stochastic processes of
anomalous diffusion and inertial effects, respectively, in the process of
surface manufacturing. The AFM images of the texture of corrosion-resistant
magnetite coatings formed on low-carbon steel in hot nitrate solutions with
coating growth promoters at different temperatures are analyzed. It is shown
that the parameters characterizing surface spikiness are able to quantify the
effect of process temperature on the corrosion resistance of the coatings. It
is suggested that these parameters can be used for predicting and
characterizing the corrosion-resistant properties of magnetite coatings.

in high fields, on the other hand, $kappa_{\|[101]}$ is enhanced with
increasing field, while $kappa_{\perp[101]}$ is suppressed. That is, the
thermal conductivity along the direction, where the magnetic interaction is
strong, is markedly enhanced in the BEC state. Accordingly, our results suggest
that the enhancement of $kappa_{\|[101]}$ in the BEC state is caused by the
enhancement of the thermal conductivity due to triplons on the basis of the

for many materials, such as metamaterials, where low-frequency scattering
resonances strongly influence the effective medium properties. This question
concerns the effect of correlations in the positions of the scatterers on the
coupling between their resonances, and hence on wave transport through the
medium. To examine this question experimentally, we measure the effective
medium wave number of acoustic waves in a sample made of bubbles embedded in an
elastic matrix over a frequency range that includes the resonance frequency of
the bubbles. The effective medium is highly dispersive, showing peaks in the
attenuation and the phase velocity as functions of the frequency, which cannot
be accurately described using the Independent Scattering Approximation (ISA).
This discrepancy may be explained by the effects of the positional correlations
of the scatterers, which we show to be dependent on the size of the scatterers.

forms a scum or raft. When such a monolayer is disturbed by the localized
introduction of a surfactant droplet, a radially divergent surfactant shock
front emanates from the surfactant origin and packs the particles into a
jammed, compact, annular band with a packing fraction that saturates at a peak
packing fraction $\phi^*$. As the resulting two-dimensional, disordered elastic
band grows with time and is driven radially outwards by the surfactant, it
fractures to form periodic triangular cracks with robust geometrical features.
We find the number of cracks $N$ and the compaction band radius $R^*$ at
fracture onset vary monotonically with the initial packing fraction
($\phi_{init}$). However, its width $W^*$ is constant for all $\phi_{init}$. A
simple geometric theory that treats the compaction band as an elastic annulus,
and accounts for mass conservation allows us to deduce that $N \simeq 2\pi
R^*/W^* \simeq 4\pi \phi_{RCP}/\phi_{init}$, a result we verify both
experimentally and numerically. We show the essential ingredients for this

surfactant driven advection to cause passive jamming and eventual fracture of
