  Systems","This article is an improved version of [1]",,,,"cs.FL cs.CC cs.CL cs.DM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Maximally parallel multiset rewriting systems (MPMRS) give a convenient way
to express relations between unstructured objects. The functioning of various
computational devices may be expressed in terms of MPMRS (e.g., register
machines and many variants of P systems). In particular, this means that MPMRS
are computationally complete; however, a direct translation leads to quite a
big number of rules. Like for other classes of computationally complete
devices, there is a challenge to find a universal system having the smallest
number of rules. In this article we present different rule minimization
strategies for MPMRS based on encodings and structural transformations. We
apply these strategies to the translation of a small universal register machine
(Korec, 1996) and we show that there exists a universal MPMRS with 23 rules.
Since MPMRS are identical to a restricted variant of P systems with antiport
rules, the results we obtained improve previously known results on the number
of rules for those systems.

larger than the sample size $n$. The difficulty when considering
high-dimensional problems is to propose estimators achieving a good compromise
between statistical and computational performances. The BIC estimator for
instance performs well from the statistical point of view \cite{BTW07} but can
only be computed for values of $p$ of at most a few tens. The Lasso estimator
is solution of a convex minimization problem, hence computable for large value
of $p$. However stringent conditions on the design are required to establish
fast rates of convergence for this estimator. Dalalyan and Tsybakov
\cite{arnak} propose a method achieving a good compromise between the
statistical and computational aspects of the problem. Their estimator can be
computed for reasonably large $p$ and satisfies nice statistical properties
under weak assumptions on the design. However, \cite{arnak} proposes sparsity
oracle inequalities in expectation for the empirical excess risk only. In this
paper, we propose an aggregation procedure similar to that of \cite{arnak} but
with improved statistical performances. Our main theoretical result is a
sparsity oracle inequality in probability for the true excess risk for a
version of exponential weight estimator. We also propose a MCMC method to
compute our estimator for reasonably large values of $p$.

Geminid meteoroid stream. However, it has never shown evidence for on-going
mass loss or for any form of comet-like activity that would indicate the
continued replenishment of the stream. Following an alert by Battams and Watson
(2009), we used NASA's STEREO-A spacecraft to image Phaethon near perihelion,
in the period UT 2009 June 17 - 22, when the heliocentric distance was near
0.14 AU. The resulting photometry shows an unexpected brightening, by a factor
of two, starting UT 2009 June 20.2+/-0.2, which we interpret as an impulsive
release of dust particles from Phaethon. If the density is near 2500 kg/m^3,
then the emitted dust particles must have a combined mass of ~2.5x10^8 a1 kg,
where a1 is the particle radius in millimeters. Assuming a1 = 1, this is
approximately 10^-4 of the Geminid stream mass and to replenish the stream in
steady-state within its estimated ~1000 yr lifetime would require ~10 events
like the one observed, per orbit. Alternatively, on-going mass loss may be
unrelated to the event which produced the Phaethon-Geminid complex. An impact
origin of the dust is highly unlikely. Phaethon is too hot for water ice to
survive, rendering unlikely the possibility that dust is ejected through
gas-drag from sublimated ice. Instead, we suggest that Phaethon is essentially
a rock comet, in which the small perihelion distance leads both to the
production of dust (through thermal fracture and decomposition-cracking of
hydrated minerals) and to its ejection into interplanetary space (through
radiation pressure sweeping and other effects).

computationally efficient algorithms for learning minimal latent trees, that
is, trees without any redundant hidden nodes. Unlike many existing methods, the
observed nodes (or variables) are not constrained to be leaf nodes. Our first
algorithm, recursive grouping, builds the latent tree recursively by
identifying sibling groups using so-called information distances. One of the
main contributions of this work is our second algorithm, which we refer to as

over the observed variables is constructed. This global step groups the

microwave background (CMB) even at the lowest order, as magnetic stresses and
the temperature anisotropy they induce depend quadratically on the magnetic
field. In contrast, CMB non-Gaussianity due to inflationary scalar
perturbations arises only as a higher order effect. Apart from a compensated
scalar mode, stochastic primordial magnetic fields also produce scalar
anisotropic stress that remains uncompensated till neutrino decoupling. This
gives rise to an adiabatic-like scalar perturbation mode that evolves passively
thereafter (called the passive mode). We compute the CMB reduced bispectrum
($b_{l_{_1}l_{_2}l_{_3}}$) induced by this passive mode, sourced via the
Sachs-Wolfe effect, on large angular scales. For any configuration of
bispectrum, taking a partial sum over mode-coupling terms, we find a typical
value of $l_1(l_1+1)l_3(l_3+1) b_{l_{_1}l_{_2}l_{_3}} \sim 6-9 \times
10^{-16}$, for a magnetic field of $B_0 \sim 3$ nG, assuming a nearly
scale-invariant magnetic spectrum . We also evaluate, in full, the bispectrum
for the squeezed collinear configuration over all angular mode-coupling terms
and find $l_1(l_1+1)l_3(l_3+1) b_{l_{_1}l_{_2}l_{_3}} \approx -1.4 \times
10^{-16}$. These values are more than $\sim 10^6$ times larger than the
previously calculated magnetic compensated scalar mode CMB bispectrum.
Observational limits on the bispectrum from WMAP7 data allow us to set upper
limits of $B_0 \sim 2$ nG on the present value of the cosmic magnetic field of
primordial origin. This is over 10 times more stringent than earlier limits on

reference \cite{VayPRL07} is shown to produce orders of magnitude speed-up of
calculations from first principles. Obtaining these speedups requires
mitigation of a high-frequency instability that otherwise limits effectiveness
in addition to solutions for handling data input and output in a
relativistically boosted frame of reference. The observed high-frequency
instability is mitigated using methods including an electromagnetic solver with
tunable coefficients, its extension to accomodate Perfectly Matched Layers and
Friedman's damping algorithms, as well as an efficient large bandwidth digital
filter. It is shown that choosing the frame of the wake as the frame of
reference allows for higher levels of filtering and damping than is possible in
other frames for the same accuracy. Detailed testing also revealed
serendipitously the existence of a singular time step at which the instability
level is minimized, independently of numerical dispersion, thus indicating that
the observed instability may not be due primarily to Numerical Cerenkov as has
been conjectured. The techniques developed for Cerenkov mitigation prove
nonetheless to be very efficient at controlling the instability. Using these
techniques, agreement at the percentage level is demonstrated between
simulations using different frames of reference, with speedups reaching two
orders of magnitude for a 0.1 GeV class stages. The method then allows direct
and efficient full-scale modeling of deeply depleted laser-plasma stages of 10
GeV-1 TeV for the first time, verifying the scaling of plasma accelerators to
very high energies. Over 4, 5 and 6 orders of magnitude speedup is achieved for
the modeling of 10 GeV, 100 GeV and 1 TeV class stages, respectively.

biaxial nematic structure. Due to the existence of large overlaps of the
stability regions, we resorted to a scheme to calculate the free energy of
these structures deep in the interior of a large Cayley tree. Both

places in the nearby universe in which massive galaxies are being forged
through a complex set of processes involving tidal interaction, ram-pressure
stripping, and perhaps finally ""dry-mergers"" of galaxies stripped of their cool
gas. Using collisionless N-body simulations, we propose a possible scenario for
the formation of one of the best studied compact groups: Stephan's Quintet. We
define a serial approach which allows us to consider the history of the group
as sequence of galaxy-galaxy interactions seen as relatively separate events in
time, but chained together in such a way as to provide a plausible scenario
that ends in the current configuration of the galaxies. By covering a large set
of parameters, we claim that it is very unlikely that both major tidal tails of
the group have been created by the interaction between the main galaxy and a
single intruder. We propose instead a scenario based on two satellites orbiting
the main disk, plus the recent involvement of an additional interloper, coming
from the background at high speed. This purely N-body study of the quintet will
provide a parameter-space exploration of the basic dynamics of the group that
can be used as a basis for a more sophisticated N-body/hydrodynamic study of
the group that is necessary to explain the giant shock structure and other
purely gaseous phenomena observed in both the cold, warm and hot gas in the

fermion chemical potential is presented in the large-$N$ limit. This model
resembles QCD in many important aspects: it is asymptotically free, has a
dynamically generated mass gap, and for zero bare fermion mass it is scale
invariant at the classical level (broken through the trace anomaly at the
quantum level). For our purposes, the introduction of a bare fermion mass is
necessary to break the integrability of the model, and thus to be able to study
momentum transport. The main motivation is, by decreasing the bare mass, to
analyze whether there is a correlation between the maximum in the trace anomaly
and a possible maximum in the bulk viscosity, as recently conjectured. After
numerical analysis, I find that there is no direct correlation between these
two quantities: the bulk viscosity of the model is a monotonously decreasing
function of the temperature. I also comment on the sum rule for the spectral
density in the bulk channel, as well as on implications of this analysis for
other systems.

structure imaged by Spitzer at redshifts near unity. We find that the average
density of 24um-detected galaxies within the Cl1604 clusters is nearly twice
that of the surrounding field and that this overdensity scales with the
cluster's dynamical state. The 24um-bright members often appear optically
unremarkable and exhibit only moderate [OII] line emission due to severe
obscuration. Their spatial distribution suggests they are an infalling
population, but an examination of their spectral properties, morphologies and
optical colors indicate they are not simply analogs of the field population
that have yet to be quenched. Using stacked composite spectra, we find the
24um-detected cluster and group galaxies exhibit elevated levels of Balmer
absorption compared to galaxies undergoing normal, continuous star formation. A
similar excess is not observed in field galaxies with equivalent infrared
luminosities, indicating a greater fraction of the detected cluster and group
members have experienced a burst of star formation in the recent past compared
to their counterparts in the field. Our results suggest that gas-rich galaxies
at high redshift experience a temporary increase in their star formation
activity as they assemble into denser environments. Using HST-ACS imaging we
find that disturbed morphologies are common among the 24um-detected cluster and
group members and become more prevalent in regions of higher galaxy density. We
conclude that mergers are the dominant triggering mechanism responsible for the
enhanced star formation found in the Cl1604 groups, while a mix of harassment
and mergers are likely driving the activity of the cluster galaxies.

potential, temperature and repulsion strength. To make contact with cold-gas
experiments, we also compute properties of the system subject to an external
trap in the local density approximation. We find that an entropy per particle
$S/N \approx 0.65(6)$ at $U/t=8$ is sufficient to achieve a Neel state in the
center of the trap, substantially higher than the entropy required in a
homogeneous system. Precursors to antiferromagnetism can clearly be observed in
nearest-neighbor spin correlators.

atoms subject to an optical lattice and a trapping potential. Our study is
focused on the temperature range of current experimental interest. We employ
two theoretical methods - dynamical mean-field theory and high-temperature
series - and perform comparative benchmarks to delimitate their respective
range of validity. Special attention is devoted to understand the implications
that thermodynamic properties of this system have on cooling. Considering the
distribution function of local occupancies in the inhomogeneous lattice, we
show that, under adiabatic evolution, the variation of any observable (e.g.,
temperature) can be conveniently disentangled into two distinct contributions.
The first contribution is due to the redistribution of atoms in the trap during
the evolution, while the second one comes from the intrinsic change of the
observable. Finally, we provide a simplified picture of the cooling procedure
recently proposed in J.-S. Bernier et al., Phys. Rev. A 79, 061601 (2009) by
applying this method to an idealized model.

easily accommodated at relatively low energy scales, which is well within the

magnitudes of large numbers of stars, but only if the individual line-of-sight
extinctions are known. Unfortunately, extinction is highly degenerate with
stellar effective temperature when estimated from broad band optical/infrared
photometry. To address this problem, I introduce a Bayesian method for
estimating the intrinsic parameters of a star and its line-of-sight extinction.
It uses both photometry and parallaxes in a self-consistent manner in order to
provide a non-parametric posterior probability distribution over the
parameters. The method makes explicit use of domain knowledge by employing the
Hertzsprung--Russell Diagram (HRD) to constrain solutions and to ensure that
they respect stellar physics. I first demonstrate this method by using it to
estimate effective temperature and extinction from BVJHK data for a set of
artificially reddened Hipparcos stars, for which accurate effective
temperatures have been estimated from high resolution spectroscopy. Using just
the four colours, we see the expected strong degeneracy (positive correlation)
between the temperature and extinction. Introducing the parallax, apparent
magnitude and the HRD reduces this degeneracy and improves both the precision
(reduces the error bars) and the accuracy of the parameter estimates, the
latter by about 35%. The resulting accuracy is about 200K in temperature and
0.2mag in extinction. I then apply the method to estimate these parameters and
absolute magnitudes for some 47000 F,G,K Hipparcos stars which have been
cross-matched with 2MASS. The method can easily be extended to incorporate the
estimation of other parameters, in particular metallicity and surface gravity,
making it particularly suitable for the analysis of the 10^9 stars from Gaia.

the time discretization of the collision step is obtained from the Wild sum

signature of thermal emission from hot dust. Most of the stars appear scattered

several others lie near the Arches and Quintuplet clusters and may have

P-alpha excess have been identified in the area surveyed with HST, which
implies that the sample of WN stars in this region is near completion, and is
dominated by late (WNL) types. The current WC sample, although probably not
complete, is almost exclusively dominated by late (WCL) types. The observed
Wolf-Rayet subtype distribution in the GCR is a reflection of the intrinsic
rarity of early subtypes (WNE and WCE) in the inner Galaxy, an effect that is
driven by metallicity.

Backward integrations of their orbits indicated that they separated gently with
low relative velocities, but did not provide additional insight into their
formation mechanism. A previously hypothesized rotational fission process4 may
explain their formation - critical predictions are that the mass ratios are
less than about 0.2 and, as the mass ratio approaches this upper limit, the
spin period of the larger body becomes long. Here we report photometric
observations of a sample of asteroid pairs revealing that primaries of pairs
with mass ratios much less than 0.2 rotate rapidly, near their critical fission
frequency. As the mass ratio approaches 0.2, the primary period grows long.
This occurs as the total energy of the system approaches zero requiring the
asteroid pair to extract an increasing fraction of energy from the primary's
spin in order to escape. We do not find asteroid pairs with mass ratios larger
than 0.2. Rotationally fissioned systems beyond this limit have insufficient
energy to disrupt. We conclude that asteroid pairs are formed by the rotational
fission of a parent asteroid into a proto-binary system which subsequently
disrupts under its own internal system dynamics soon after formation.

couplings of the sigma and f_0(980) to pi-pi and/or \bar KK, which can also be
due to a light scalar gluonium with large OZI violating couplings but not

relationship between temperature and field scales and creating a distinctive
double-peak structure in the electronic specific heat. We show that this
apparent non-Fermi liquid behaviour can be caused at mean-field level by a peak
in the density of states.

determine the positions of sensor nodes and a moving target in a network, given
incomplete and inaccurate range measurements between the target and each of the
sensors. One of the established methods for achieving this is to iteratively
maximize a likelihood function (ML), which requires initialization with an
approximate solution to avoid convergence towards local extrema. This paper
develops methods for handling both Gaussian and Laplacian noise, the latter
modeling the presence of outliers in some practical ranging systems that
adversely affect the performance of localization algorithms designed for
Gaussian noise. A modified Euclidean Distance Matrix (EDM) completion problem
is solved for a block of target range measurements to approximately set up
initial sensor/target positions, and the likelihood function is then
iteratively refined through Majorization-Minimization (MM). To avoid the
computational burden of repeatedly solving increasingly large EDM problems in
time-recursive operation an incremental scheme is exploited whereby a new
target/node position is estimated from previously available node/target
locations to set up the iterative ML initial point for the full spatial
configuration. The above methods are first derived under Gaussian noise
assumptions, and modifications for Laplacian noise are then considered.
Analytically, the main challenges to be overcome in the Laplacian case stem
from the non-differentiability of $\ell_1$ norms that arise in the various cost
functions. Simulation results confirm that the proposed algorithms
significantly outperform existing methods for SLAT in the presence of outliers,
while offering comparable performance for Gaussian noise.

intuitionistic S5 extended with a lax modality that encapsulates effectful

the peculiar spectrum of SDSS J141624.08+134826.7 is primarily a result of thin

the atmosphere of SDSS J141624.08+134826.7 based on the absence of the deep 3.3
micron CH4 absorption band predicted by models computed in chemical

appealing way to quantitatively estimate the vigor of mixing in the atmospheres

surrounded by a large, irregular, low-surface brightness substructure. Here, we
quantify the stellar populations and structure of this feature using the PAndAS
data. We show that the stellar populations of this feature are consistent with
an old population with $<[Fe/H]>\sim-1.6$dex and an interquartile range in
metallicity of $\sim0.5$dex. We construct a surface brightness map of M33 that
traces this feature to $\mu_V\simeq33$mags\,arcsec$^{-2}$. At these low surface
brightness levels, the structure extends to projected radii of $\sim40$kpc from
the center of M33 in both the north-west and south-east quadrants of the
galaxy. Overall, the structure has an ""S-shaped"" appearance that broadly aligns
with the orientation of the HI disk warp. We calculate a lower limit to the
integrated luminosity of the structure of $-12.7\pm0.5$mags, comparable to a
bright dwarf galaxy such as Fornax or AndII and slightly less than $1\$ of the
total luminosity of M33. Further, we show that there is tentative evidence for
a distortion in the distribution of young stars near the edge of the HI disk
that occurs at similar azimuth to the warp in HI. The data also hint at a
low-level, extended stellar component at larger radius that may be a M33 halo

the method of matched asymptotic expansions with the detailed numerical study

instability mechanisms of multi-spot quasi-equilibrium patterns for the GS

collective coordinates $S_j$ and ${\mathbf x}_j$ for $j=1,...,k$ is derived,
which characterizes the slow dynamics of a spot pattern. Instabilities of the
multi-spot pattern due to the three distinct mechanisms of spot
self-replication, spot oscillation, and spot annihilation, are studied by first
deriving certain associated eigenvalue problems by using singular perturbation
techniques. From a numerical computation of the spectrum of these eigenvalue
problems, phase diagrams representing in the GS parameter space corresponding
to the onset of spot instabilities are obtained for various simple spatial
configurations of multi-spot patterns. In addition, it is shown that there is a
wide parameter range where a spot instability can be triggered only as a result
of the intrinsic slow motion of the collection of spots. The hybrid

The thermal temperature of this emission, when fitted with a blackbody, is as
low as 32.5(+8.0,-6.0)eV. This is in remarkable contrast to the canonical
temperatures of ~0.1-0.2keV found hitherto for the soft X-ray excess in active
galactic nuclei (AGN), and is interestingly close to the maximum temperature
predicted for a postulated accretion disc in this object. If this emission is
indeed blackbody in nature, the derived luminosity
[3.5(+3.3,-1.5)x10^(44)ergs/s] infers a compact emitting area with a size
[~5x10^(12)cm or 0.33AU in radius] that is comparable to several times the
Schwarzschild radius of a black hole at the mass estimated for this AGN
(3x10^6Msun). In fact, this ultra-steep X-ray emission can be well fitted as
the (Compton scattered) Wien tail of the multi-temperature blackbody emission
from an optically thick accretion disc, whose parameters inferred (black hole
mass and accretion rate) are in good agreement with independent estimates using
optical emission line spectrum. We thus consider this feature as a signature of
the long-sought X-ray radiation directly from a disc around a super-massive
black hole, presenting observational evidence for a black hole accretion disc
in AGN. Future observations with better data quality, together with improved
independent measurements of the black hole mass, may constrain the spin of the

The soft X-ray component was detected from all of them, with a typical

dominating above ~10 keV, was detected at ~1 mCrab intensity from 7 of them.
Therefore, the spectrum composed of a soft emission and a hard-tail component

and quiescent states. Wide-band spectral analyses revealed that the hard-tail
component has a 1-60 keV flux, Fh, comparable to or even higher than that
carried by the 1-60 keV soft component, Fs. The hardness ratio of these

a correlation coefficient of -0.989, over the range from xi~10 to xi~0.1.
Magnetars in outburst states were found to lie on the same correlation as
relatively quiescent ones. This hardness ratio is also positively correlated

in fluid turbulence is presented. The topology is characterized using the Weiss
criterion that provides a simplified tool to partition the flow into
topologically different regions: elliptic (vortex dominated), hyperbolic
(deformation dominated), and intermediate (turbulent background). The flow
corresponds to forced two-dimensional Navier-Stokes turbulence in doubly
periodic and circular bounded domains with non-slip boundary conditions. In the
double periodic domain, the probability density function (pdf) of the Weiss
field exhibits a negative skewness consistent with the fact that in periodic
domains the flow is dominated by coherent vortex structures. On the other hand,
in the circular domain, the elliptic and hyperbolic regions seem to be
statistically similar. We follow a Lagrangian approach and obtain the
statistics by tracking large ensembles of passively advected tracers. The pdfs
of residence time in the topologically different regions are computed using the
Lagrangian Weiss field, i.e., the Weiss field computed along the particles'
trajectories. In elliptic and hyperbolic regions, the pdfs of the residence
time have self-similar algebraic decaying tails. On the other hand, in the
intermediate regions the pdf has exponential decaying tails. The conditional
(with respect to the flow topology) pdfs of the Lagrangian velocity exhibit
Gaussian behavior in the periodic and in the bounded domains. In contrast to
the freely decaying turbulence case, the conditional pdfs of the Lagrangian
acceleration in forced turbulence show a comparable level of intermittency in
the periodic and the bounded domains. The conditional pdfs of the Lagrangian
curvature are characterized, in all cases, by self-similar power law behavior
with a decay exponent of order -2.

standard questions in statistical mechanics, and use the results to derive
limitations of classical measurements. A central problem is the relation
between systems which appear macroscopically dissipative but are
microscopically lossless. We show that a linear system is dissipative if, and
only if, it can be approximated by a linear lossless system over arbitrarily
long time intervals. Hence lossless systems are in this sense dense in
dissipative systems. A linear active system can be approximated by a nonlinear
lossless system that is charged with initial energy. As a by-product, we obtain
mechanisms explaining the Onsager relations from time-reversible lossless
approximations, and the fluctuation-dissipation theorem from uncertainty in the
initial state of the lossless system. The results are applied to measurement
devices and are used to quantify limits on the so-called observer effect, also
called back action, which is the impact the measurement device has on the
observed system. In particular, it is shown that deterministic back action can
be compensated by using active elements, whereas stochastic back action is
unavoidable and depends on the temperature of the measurement device.

defining a weak topology on many-body states, which appropriately describes the
physical behavior of the system in the case of lack of compactness, that is
when some particles are lost at infinity. We provide several important
properties of this topology and use them to provide a simple proof of the

G\'erard, and we relate this tool to our weak topology. We then provide several
applications. We start by studying the so-called finite-rank approximation
which consists in imposing that the many-body wavefunction can be expanded
using finitely many one-body functions. We thereby emphasize geometric
properties of Hartree-Fock states and prove nonlinear versions of the HVZ
theorem, in the spirit of works of Friesecke. In the last section we study

single-qubit measurements on a highly entangled resource state. Resource states
can arise from ground states of carefully designed two-body interacting
Hamiltonians. This opens up an appealing possibility of creating them by
cooling. The family of Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) states are the ground
states of particularly simple Hamiltonians with high symmetry, and their

Expanding on our prior work [T.-C. Wei, I. Affleck, and R. Raussendorf, Phys.

spin-3/2 AKLT state on a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice is a universal

provide an alternative proof that the 1D spin-1 AKLT state can be used to
simulate arbitrary one-qubit unitary gates. Moreover, we connect the quantum
computational universality of 2D random graph states to their percolation
property and show that these states whose graphs are in the supercritical (i.e.

studied in the presence of both intrinsic and extrinsic (Rashba) spin-orbit
coupling (SOC). At normal incidence electrons are completely reflected when the
Rashba interaction (with strength $\lambda_R$) is dominant whereas they are
perfectly transmitted if the two types of SOC are exactly balanced. At normal
incidence, the transmission probability of the step is thus controlled
continuously from 0 to 1 by tuning the ratio of the two types of SOC. Besides
the transport of charge in the direction normal to the barrier, we show the
existence of a spin transport along the barrier. The magnitude of the spin Hall
current is determined by a subtle interplay between the height of the potential
step and the position of Fermi energy. It is demonstrated that contributions
from inter-band matrix elements and evanescent modes are dominant in spin
transport. Moreover, in the case of vanishing extrinsic SOC ($\lambda_R =0$),
each channel carries a conserved spin current, in contrast to the general case
of a finite $\lambda_R$, in which only integrated spin current is a conserved
quantity. Finally, we provide a quasi-classical picture of the charge and spin

random walks on networks with a specific property are very useful, since a
universal method for calculating MFPT on general graphs is not available

for explicitly determining the partial mean first-passage time (PMFPT), i.e.,
the average of MFPTs to a given target averaged over all possible starting
positions, and the entire mean first-passage time (EMFPT), which is the average
of MFPTs over all pairs of nodes on regular treelike fractals. We describe the
processes with a family of regular fractals with treelike structure. The
proposed fractals include the $T$ fractal and the Peano basin fractal as their
special cases. We provide a formula for MFPT between two directly connected
nodes in general trees on the basis of which we derive an exact expression for
PMFPT to the central node in the fractals. Moreover, we give a technique for
calculating EMFPT, which is based on the relationship between characteristic
polynomials of the fractals at different generations and avoids the computation
of eigenvalues of the characteristic polynomials. Making use of the proposed
methods, we obtain analytically the closed-form solutions to PMFPT and EMFPT on

complexity does not grow with the number of flows. The other major contribution
of this paper is the new analytical formulation of the performance metrics. It
relies on a matrix representation of the constraints imposed by the

turbulence in the diffuse interstellar medium, where both, turbulence and
thermal instability interact in a highly non-linear manner. Aims: We study
basic properties of turbulence in thermally bistable gas for variable
simulation parameters. The resulting cold gas fractions can be applied as
parameterisation in simulations on galactic scales. Methods: Turbulent flow is
induced on large scales by means of compressive stochastic forcing in a
periodic box. The compressible Euler equations with constant UV heating and a
parameterised cooling function are solved on uniform grids. We investigate
several values of the mean density of the gas and different magnitudes of the
forcing. For comparison with other numerical studies, solenoidal forcing is
applied as well. Results: After a transient phase, we observe that a state of
statistically stationary turbulence is approached. Compressive forcing
generally produces a two-phase medium, with a decreasing fraction of cold gas
for increasing forcing strength. This behaviour can be explained on the basis
of turbulent mixing. We also find indications for power-law tails of
probability density functions of the gas density. Solenoidal forcing, on the
other hand, appears to prevent the evolution into a two-phase-medium for
certain parameter regions. Conclusions: The dynamics of thermally bistable
turbulence shows a substantial sensitivity on the initial state and the forcing
properties.

indications of Pauli-limited superconductivity. A variety of measurements give
evidence for a transition at high magnetic fields inside the superconducting
state, when the field is applied either parallel to or perpendicular to the c
axis. When the field is perpendicular to the c axis, antiferromagnetic order is
observed on the high-field side of the transition, with a magnetic wavevector
of (q q 0.5), where q = 0.44 reciprocal lattice units. We show that this order
remains as the magnetic field is rotated out of the basal plane, but the
associated moment eventually disappears above 17 degrees, indicating that the
anomalies seen with the field parallel to the c axis are not related to this
magnetic order. We discuss the implications of this finding.

dynamics is purely deterministic. A cold system undergoes a gravitational
collapse leading to a finite time singularity: the central density increases
and becomes infinite in a finite time t_coll. The evolution continues in the
post collapse regime. A Dirac peak emerges, grows and finally captures all the
mass in a finite time t_end, while the central density excluding the Dirac peak
progressively decreases. Close to the collapse time, the pre and post collapse
evolution is self-similar. Interestingly, if one starts from a parabolic
density profile, one obtains an exact analytical solution that describes the
whole collapse dynamics, from the initial time to the end, and accounts for non
self-similar corrections that were neglected in previous works. Our results
have possible application in different areas including astrophysics,
chemotaxis, colloids and nanoscience.

potentials which are negative with respect to the plasma potential.
Theoretically, walls are usually treated as perfect absorber for electrons and
ions implying perfect sticking of the particles to the wall and infinitely long
desorption times for particles stuck to the wall. For electrons we question the
perfect absorber model and calculate, specifically for a planar dielectric
wall, the electron sticking coefficient $s_e$ and the electron desorption time
$\tau_e$. For the uncharged wall we find $s_e\ll 1$ and $\tau_e\approx
10^{-4}s$. Thus, in the early stage of the build-up of the wall potential, when
the wall is essentially uncharged, the wall is not a perfect absorber for
electrons. For the charged wall we find $\tau_e^{-1}\approx 0$. Thus, $\tau_e$
approaches the perfect absorber value. But $s_e$ is still only of the order of
$10^{-1}$. Calculating $s_e$ as a function of the wall potential and combining
this expression with the quasi-stationary balance equations for the electron
and ion surface densities we find the selfconsistent wall potential, including
surface effects, to be 30% of the perfect absorber value.

Cyg X-1. We find that it has had a stable period of about 300 d in soft and
hard X-rays and in radio since 2005 until at least 2010, which is about double
the previously seen period. This new period, seen in the hard spectral state
only, is detected not only in the light curves but also in soft X-ray hardness
ratios and in the amplitude of the orbital modulation. On the other hand, the
spectral slope in hard X-rays, >20 keV, averaged over superorbital bins is
constant, and the soft and hard X-rays and the radio emission change in phase.
This shows that the superorbital variability consists of changing the
normalization of an intrinsic spectrum of a constant shape and of changes of
the absorbing column density with the phase. The maximum column density is
achieved at the superorbital minimum. The amplitude changes are likely to be
caused by a changing viewing angle of an anisotropic emitter, most likely a
precessing accretion disc. The constant shape of the intrinsic spectrum shows
that this modulation is not caused by a changing accretion rate. The modulated
absorbing column density shows the presence of a bulge around the disc centre,
as proposed previously. We also find the change of the superorbital period from
about 150 d to about 300 d to be associated with almost unchanged average X-ray
fluxes, making the period change difficult to explain in the framework of
disc-irradiation models. Finally, we find no correlation of the X-ray and radio
properties with the reported detections in the GeV and TeV gamma-ray range.

where the vertices are the system's elements and edges between vertices
indicate the interactions between the corresponding elements. Edges may be
weighted if the interaction strength is measurable. However, the full network
information is often redundant because tools and techniques from network
analysis do not work or become very inefficient if the network is too dense and
some weights may just reflect measurement errors, and shall be discarded.
Moreover, since weight distributions in many complex weighted networks are
broad, most of the weight is concentrated among a small fraction of all edges.
It is then crucial to properly detect relevant edges. Simple thresholding would
leave only the largest weights, disrupting the multiscale structure of the
system, which is at the basis of the structure of complex networks, and ought
to be kept. In this paper we propose a weight filtering technique based on a
global null model (GloSS filter), keeping both the weight distribution and the
full topological structure of the network. The method correctly quantifies the
statistical significance of weights assigned independently to the edges from a
given distribution. Applications to real networks reveal that the GloSS filter
is indeed able to identify relevantconnections between vertices.

thermodynamic description of the effect usually deals with reversible

temperature change in terms of the change of the relative ferromagnetic
fraction induced by magnetic field. To evaluate our model, we performed direct
measurement of the sample's adiabatic temperature change by means of a

extent of endogenous origin, i.e. determined by the trading activity itself and
not due to the rational processing of exogenous news. In order to understand
why and how prices move, the joint fluctuations of order flow and liquidity -
and the way these impact prices - become the key ingredients. Impact is
necessary for private information to be reflected in prices, but by the same
token, random fluctuations in order flow necessarily contribute to the
volatility of markets. Our thesis is that the latter contribution is in fact
dominant, resulting in a decoupling between prices and fundamental values, at
least on short to medium time scales. We argue that markets operate in a regime
of vanishing revealed liquidity, but large latent liquidity, which would
explain their hyper-sensitivity to fluctuations. More precisely, we identify a
dangerous feedback loop between bid-ask spread and volatility that may lead to
micro-liquidity crises and price jumps. We discuss several other unstable
feedback loops that should be relevant to account for market crises: imitation,
unwarranted quantitative models, pro-cyclical regulation, etc.

tools of scale relativity. Previously, quantum motion equations (Schr\""odinger,
Klein-Gordon, Dirac, Pauli) have been derived as geodesic equations written
with a quantum-covariant derivative operator. Then, the nature of gauge
transformations, of gauge fields and of conserved charges have been given a
geometric meaning in terms of a scale-covariant derivative tool. Finally, the
electromagnetic Klein-Gordon equation has been recovered with a covariant
derivative constructed by combining the quantum-covariant velocity operator and
the scale-covariant derivative. We show here that if one tries to derive the
electromagnetic Dirac equation from the Klein-Gordon one as for the free
particle motion, i.e. as a square root of the time part of the Klein-Gordon
operator, one obtains an additional term which is the relativistic analog of
the spin-magnetic field coupling term of the Pauli equation. However, if one
first applies the quantum covariance, then implements the scale covariance
through the scale-covariant derivative, one obtains the electromagnetic Dirac
equation in its usual form. This method can also be applied successfully to the
derivation of the electromagnetic Klein-Gordon equation. This suggests it rests
on more profound roots of the theory, since it encompasses naturally the
spin-charge coupling.

surrounding intergalactic medium. The extent of the evolutionary impact is
partly determined by the duration of the starburst, which has a direct
correlation with both the amount of stellar feedback and the development of
galactic winds, particularly for smaller mass dwarf systems. We measure the
duration of starbursts in twenty nearby, ongoing, and ""fossil"" starbursts in
dwarf galaxies based on the recent star formation histories derived from
resolved stellar population data obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope.
Contrary to the shorter times of 3-10 Myr often cited, the starburst durations
we measure range from 450 - 650 Myr in fifteen of the dwarf galaxies and up to
1.3 Gyr in four galaxies; these longer durations are comparable to or longer
than the dynamical timescales for each system. The same feedback from massive
stars that may quench the flickering SF does not disrupt the overall burst
event in our sample of galaxies. While five galaxies present fossil bursts,
fifteen galaxies show ongoing bursts and thus the final durations may be longer
than we report here for these systems. One galaxy shows a burst that has been
ongoing for only 20 Myr; we are likely seeing the beginning of a burst event in
this system. Using the duration of the starbursts, we calculate that the bursts
deposited 10^(53.9)-10^(57.2) ergs of energy into the interstellar medium
through stellar winds and supernovae and produced 3%-26% of the host galaxy's
mass.

when considering inverse problems in the multiscale context. The first idea is
that the choice of space or set in which to seek the solution to the inverse
problem is intimately related to whether a homogenized or full multiscale
solution is required. This is a choice of regularization. The second idea is
that, if a homogenized solution to the inverse problem is what is desired, then
this can be recovered from carefully designed observations of the full

range of the fixed-grid nodes, keeping in mind the actual radio range of
commonly available nodes, to allow for routing through them. Routing is not
addressed by GRADELOC, but is of prime importance to the deployment of any
adhoc network, especially sensor networks. A theoretical model expressing the
radio range in terms of the cell dimensions of the grid infrastructure is
proposed, to help in carrying out a deployment plan which achieves the
desirable precision of coarse-grained localization. Secondly, in GRADELOC it is
observed that fine-grained localization does not achieve significant
performance benefits over coarse-grained localization. In IGRADELOC, this
factor is addressed with the introduction of a parameter that could be used to
improve and fine-tune the precision of fine-grained localization.

form of limitations on the buffer violation probabilities are considered. The
throughput under such constraints is captured by the effective capacity
formulation. It is assumed that finite blocklength codes are employed for
transmission. Under this assumption, a recent result on the channel coding rate
in the finite blocklength regime is incorporated into the analysis and the
throughput achieved with such codes in the presence of queueing constraints and
decoding errors is identified. Performance of different transmission strategies
(e.g., variable-rate, variable-power, and fixed-rate transmissions) is studied.
Interactions between the throughput, queueing constraints, coding blocklength,
decoding error probabilities, and signal-to-noise ratio are investigated and
several conclusions with important practical implications are drawn.

which so far has prevented the direct and quantitative experimental study of
genuine quantum correlations in many-body systems: The need for a full
characterization of the state to quantify the entanglement contained in it.
Instead, the scheme presented here relies solely on global measurements that
are routinely performed and is versatile enough to accommodate systems and

with m_{\tG}\agt 30 TeV, a rather high Peccei-Quinn breaking scale and an
initial mis-alignment angle \theta_i < 1. We calculate axion and axino dark
matter production from four sources, and impose BBN constraints on long-lived
gravitinos and neutralinos. Moreover, we discuss several SUSY models which
naturally have gravitino masses of the order of tens of TeV. We find a
reconciliation difficult in Yukawa-unified SUSY and in AMSB with a wino-like
lightest neutralino. However, T_R\sim 10^{10}-10^{12} GeV can easily be
achieved in effective SUSY and in models based on mixed moduli-anomaly
mediation. Consequences of this scenario include: 1. an LHC SUSY discovery
should be consistent with SUSY models with a large gravitino mass, 2. an
apparent neutralino relic abundance \Omega_{\tz_1}h^2\alt 1, 3. no WIMP direct

less than \sim 10^{-6} eV, somewhat below the conventional range which is

the influence of specific nuclear reactions on the Ti44 and Ni56 abundance
evolution. Reactions that affect all yields globally are the 3a, p(e-,nu)n and
n(e+,nubar)p. The rest of the reactions are ranked according to their degree of

Here we show how arrays of spin-torque nano-oscillators (STNO) can create
propagating spin-wave interference patterns of use for memory and computation.
Memristic transponders distributed on the thin film respond to threshold tunnel
magnetoresistance (TMR) values thereby detecting the spin-waves and creating
new excitation patterns. We show how groups of transponders create resonant
