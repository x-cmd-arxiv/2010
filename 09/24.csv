discuss the problem of acausal propagation in the diffusion equation and
introduce the modified Maxwell-Cattaneo-Vernotte (MCV) equation. By using the
modified MCV equation, we obtain the causal dissipative relativistic (CDR)
fluid dynamics, where unphysical propagation with infinite velocity does not
exist. We further show that the problems of the violation of causality and
instability are intimately related, and the relativistic Navier-Stokes equation
is inadequate as the theory of relativistic fluids. Finally, the new
microscopic formula to calculate the transport coefficients of the CDR fluid
dynamics is discussed. The result of the microscopic formula is consistent with
that of the Boltzmann equation, i.e., Grad's moment method.

of core-collapse supernova evolution. The first set of results from these
calculations was published in Ott et al. (2008). We have followed a nonrotating
and a rapidly rotating 20 solar mass model for ~400 ms after bounce. We show
that the radiation fields vary much less with angle than the matter quantities
in the region of net neutrino heating. This obtains because most neutrinos are
emitted from inner radiative regions and because the specific intensity is an
integral over sources from many angles at depth. The latter effect can only be
captured by multi-angle transport. We then compute the phase relationship
between dipolar oscillations in the shock radius and in matter and radiation
quantities throughout the postshock region. We demonstrate a connection between
variations in neutrino flux and the hydrodynamical shock oscillations, and use
a variant of the Rayleigh test to estimate the detectability of these neutrino
fluctuations in IceCube and Super-K. Neglecting flavor oscillations,
fluctuations in our nonrotating model would be detectable to ~10 kpc in
IceCube, and a detailed power spectrum could be measured out to ~5 kpc. These
distances are considerably lower in our rapidly rotating model or with
significant flavor oscillations. Finally, we measure the impact of rapid
rotation on detectable neutrino signals. Our rapidly rotating model has strong,
species-dependent asymmetries in both its peak neutrino flux and its light
curves. The peak flux and decline rate show pole-equator ratios of up to ~3 and
~2, respectively.

in the flaring active region where clear, permanent, stepwise field changes
occurred. The median duration of the field changes was about 15 minutes and was
approximately equal for X-class and for M-class flares. The absolute values of
the field changes ranged from the detection limit of $\sim\!\!10$~G to as high
as $\sim\!\!450$~G in two exceptional cases. The median value was 69~G. Field
changes were significantly stronger for X-class than for M-class flares and for
limb flares than for disk-center flares. Longitudinal field changes less than
100~G tended to decrease longitudinal field strengths, both close to
disk-center and close to the limb, while field changes greater than 100~G
showed no such pattern. Likewise, longitudinal flux strengths tended to
decrease during flares. Flux changes, particularly net flux changes near
disk-center, correlated better than local field changes with GOES peak X-ray
flux. The strongest longitudinal field and flux changes occurred in flares
observed close to the limb. We estimate the change of Lorentz force associated
with each flare and find that this is large enough in some cases to power
seismic waves. We find that longitudinal field decreases would likely outnumber

ratio up to 20,000 at 260mK. Within the band gap, the conductance decreases
exponentially by 3 orders of magnitude with increasing electric field, and can
be accounted for by variable range hopping with a gate-tunable density of
states, effective mass, and localization length. At large B, we observe quantum
Hall conductance with fractional values, which arise from equilibration of edge
states between differentially-doped regions, and the presence of an insulating
state at filling factor {\nu}=0. Our work underscores the importance of bilayer
graphene for both fundamental interest and technological applications.

i.e., the two-Higgs-doublet model, the scalar leptoquark model, the sequential
fourth generation fermion model and the vector-like quark model. Cross sections
for these processes can deviate significantly from the standard model
predictions due to the one-loop correction to the triple Higgs boson coupling
constant. For the one-loop induced processes such as $gg \to hh$ and
$\gamma\gamma\to hh$, where $h$ is the (lightest) Higgs boson and $g$ and
$\gamma$ respectively represent a gluon and a photon, the cross sections can
also be affected by new physics particles via additional one-loop diagrams. In
the two-Higgs-doublet model and scalar leptoquark models, cross sections of
$e^+e^-\to hhZ$ and $\gamma\gamma\to hh$ can be enhanced due to the
non-decoupling effect in the one-loop corrections to the triple Higgs boson
coupling constant. In the sequential fourth generation fermion model, the cross
section for $gg\to hh$ becomes very large because of the loop effect of the
fermions. In the vector-like quark model, effects are small because the theory
has decoupling property. Measurements of the Higgs boson pair production
processes can be useful to explore new physics through the determination of the

when nodes are mobile. Further, multi-rate system make the analysis of

as nodes are moving within communication range. `Route Discovery' which is to
find the optimal route and transmission schedule is an important issue. Route
discovery entails some cost; so one would not like to initiate discovery too
often. On the other hand, not discovering reasonably often entails the risk of
being stuck with a suboptimal route and/or schedule, which hurts end-to-end
throughput. The implementation of the routing decision problem in one
dimensional mobile ad hoc network as Markov decision process problem is already

discussed in the same paper without giving a way to find the threshold. In this

work is to communicate to the high energy physics community some of the central
unsolved problems in high $T_c$ superconductors. Because of interest in the
nearly perfect fluidity of the cold gases and because of new tools such as the
AdS/CFT correspondence, this better communication may lead to important
progress in a variety of different fields. A second motivation is to draw
attention to the great power of transport measurements which more directly
reflect the excitation spectrum than, say, thermodynamics and thus strongly
constrain microscopic theories of correlated fermionic superfluids. Our
calculations show that bad metal and perfect fluid behavior is associated with
the presence of a normal state excitation gap which suppresses the effective
number of carriers leading to anomalously low conductivity and viscosity above
the transition temperature $T_c$. Below $T_c$ we demonstrate that the
condensate collective modes (""phonons"") do not couple to transverse probes such
as the shear viscosity. As a result, our calculated shear viscosity at low $T$
becomes arbitrarily small as observed in experiments. In both homogeneous and
trap calculations we do not find the upturn in $\eta$ or $\eta/s$ (where $s$ is
the entropy density) found in most theories. In the process of these studies we
demonstrate compatibility with the transverse sum rule and find reasonable

excesses increase, a trend not shown by the [Cu/Fe] and [Mn/Fe] ratios. Also,
the excess of Mn, Cu and Zn relative to heavy elements usually show an
increasing trend toward higher metallicities. Our results suggest that a larger
fraction of the synthesis of Zn is owed to massive stars than is the case of
Cu, and that the contribution of the main-s process to the synthesis of both
elements is small. We also conclude that Mn is mostly synthesized by SN Ia, and
that a non-negligible fraction of the synthesis of Mn, Cu and Zn is owed to the
weak s-process.

been the object of particular attention recently, as it constitutes the major
theoretical uncertainty when predicting the angular power spectrum of Cosmic
Microwave Background anisotropies. Lyman transitions, in particular the
Lyman-alpha line, have long been recognized as one of the bottlenecks of
recombination, due to their very low escape probabilities. The Sobolev
approximation does not describe radiative transfer in the vicinity of Lyman
lines to a sufficient degree of accuracy, and several corrections have already
been computed in other works. In this paper, the impact of some previously
ignored radiative transfer effects is calculated. First, the effect of Thomson
scattering in the vicinity of the Lyman-alpha line is evaluated, using a full
redistribution kernel incorporated into a radiative transfer code. The effect
of feedback of distortions generated by the optically thick deuterium
Lyman-alpha line blueward of the hydrogen line is investigated with an analytic
approximation. It is shown that both effects are negligible during cosmological
hydrogen recombination. Secondly, the importance of high-lying, non overlapping
Lyman transitions is assessed. It is shown that escape from lines above
Ly-gamma and frequency diffusion in Ly-beta and higher lines can be neglected
without loss of accuracy. Thirdly, a formalism generalizing the Sobolev
approximation is developed to account for the overlap of the high-lying Lyman
lines, which is shown to lead to negligible changes to the recombination
history. Finally, the possibility of a cosmological hydrogen recombination
maser is investigated. It is shown that there is no such maser in the purely
radiative treatment presented here.

the presence of a hard (non-thermal) X-ray excess. We find that in most cases
the clusters' emission in the 0.3-200keV band can be explained by a
multi-temperature thermal model confirming our previous results. For two
clusters (Bullet and Abell 3667) we find evidence for the presence of a hard

presence of a non-thermal, power-law like, component with a 20-100 keV flux of
3.4 \times 10-12 erg cm-2 s-1 as detected in previous studies. For Abell 3667
the excess emission can be successfully modeled as a hot component (kT=~13keV).

constrain the initial orbital energies of any single, binary or triple systems
that went into the encounter. The initial semi-major axes of the orbits provide
an estimate for the collisional cross section and therefore the time-scale for
the encounter to occur in its host cluster. We have applied our analytic

pronounced baryon acoustic oscillations. The amplitude of these oscillations is

dust and star formation in nearby spiral and irregular galaxies. The ensemble
dataset is an especially valuable resource for studying star formation in dwarf
galaxies, which comprise over 80% of the sample. We describe the GALEX survey
programs which obtained the data and provide a catalog of far-UV (~1500
Angstroms) and near-UV (~2200 Angstroms) integrated photometry. General UV
properties of the sample are briefly discussed. We compute two measures of the
global star formation efficiency, the SFR per unit HI gas mass and the SFR per
unit stellar mass, to illustrate the significant differences that can arise in
our understanding of dwarf galaxies when the FUV is used to measure the SFR
instead of H-alpha. We find that dwarf galaxies may not be as drastically
inefficient in coverting gas into stars as suggested by prior H-alpha studies.
In this context, we also examine the UV properties of late-type dwarf galaxies
that appear to be devoid of star formation because they were not detected in
previous H-alpha narrowband observations. Nearly all such galaxies in our
sample are detected in the FUV, and have FUV SFRs that fall below the limit
where the H-alpha flux is robust to Poisson fluctuations in the formation of
massive stars. The UV colors and star formation efficiencies of
H-alpha-undetected, UV-bright dwarf irregulars appear to be relatively
unremarkable with respect to those exhibited by the general population of
star-forming galaxies.

of their grains and by the atomic structure of their grain boundaries. These
effects should be especially pronounced in 2D materials, where even a line
defect can divide and disrupt a crystal. These issues take on practical
significance in graphene, a hexagonal two-dimensional crystal of carbon atoms;
Single-atom-thick graphene sheets can now be produced by chemical vapor
deposition on up to meter scales, making their polycrystallinity almost
unavoidable. Theoretically, graphene grain boundaries are predicted to have
distinct electronic, magnetic, chemical, and mechanical properties which
strongly depend on their atomic arrangement. Yet, because of the
five-order-of-magnitude size difference between grains and the atoms at grain
boundaries, few experiments have fully explored the graphene grain structure.
Here, we use a combination of old and new transmission electron microscope
techniques to bridge these length scales. Using atomic-resolution imaging, we
determine the location and identity of every atom at a grain boundary and find
that different grains stitch together predominantly via pentagon-heptagon
pairs. We then use diffraction-filtered imaging to rapidly map the location,
orientation, and shape of several hundred grains and boundaries, where only a
handful have been previously reported. The resulting images reveal an
unexpectedly small and intricate patchwork of grains connected by tilt
boundaries. By correlating grain imaging with scanned probe measurements, we
show that these grain boundaries dramatically weaken the mechanical strength of
graphene membranes, but do not measurably alter their electrical properties.
These techniques open a new window for studies on the structure, properties,
and control of grains and grain boundaries in graphene and other 2D materials.

substitution, the superconducting transition temperature changes only in
underdoped cuprates, while there is no considerable OIE at the optimal doped as

interactions can give rise to exotic superconducting states, as pair density

for these new types of ground states in cold atom and in metallic systems has
been intense. In the case of metals the different quasi-particles may be the up

distinct atomic orbitals that coexist at a common Fermi surface. These systems
present a complex phase diagram as a function of the difference between the
Fermi wave-vectors of the different bands. This can be controlled by external
means, varying the density in the two-component cold atom system or, in a
metal, by applying an external magnetic field or pressure. Here we study the
zero temperature instability of the normal system as the Fermi wave-vectors

quantum phase transition to a PDW superconducting state. From the nature of the
quantum critical fluctuations close to the superconducting quantum critical

a low-mass extension of the stellar mass function, but a proper formalism needs
to take care of the fact that the statistical properties of planet populations
are linked to the properties of their respective host stars. This can be
accounted for by describing planet populations by means of a differential
planetary mass-radius-orbit function, which together with the fraction of stars
with given properties that are orbited by planets and the stellar mass function
allows to derive all statistics for any considered sample. These fundamental
functions provide a framework for comparing statistics that result from
different observing techniques and campaigns which all have their very specific
selection procedures and detection efficiencies. Moreover, recent results both
from gravitational microlensing campaigns and radial-velocity surveys of stars
indicate that planets tend to cluster in systems rather than being the lonely
child of their respective parent star. While planetary multiplicity in an
observed system becomes obvious with the detection of several planets, its
quantitative assessment however comes with the challenge to exclude the
presence of further planets. Current exoplanet samples begin to give us first
hints at the population statistics, whereas pictures of planet parameter space
in its full complexity call for samples that are 2-4 orders of magnitude
larger. In order to derive meaningful statistics however, planet detection
campaigns need to be designed in such a way that well-defined
fully-deterministic target selection, monitoring, and detection criteria are
applied. The probabilistic nature of gravitational microlensing makes this
technique an illustrative example of all the encountered challenges and

messages, such as microblogging, has tremendously grown in the past few years.
Although the use of such applications by domestic users is usually free, their
access from mobile devices is subject to fees and consumes energy from limited
batteries. If a user activates his mobile device and is in range of a service
provider, a content update is received at the expense of monetary and energy
costs. Thus, users face a tradeoff between such costs and their messages aging.
The goal of this paper is to show how to cope with such a tradeoff, by devising
\emph{aging control policies}. An aging control policy consists of deciding,
based on the current utility of the last message received, whether to activate
the mobile device, and if so, which technology to use (WiFi or 3G). We present
a model that yields the optimal aging control policy. Our model is based on a
Markov Decision Process in which states correspond to message ages. Using our
model, we show the existence of an optimal strategy in the class of threshold
strategies, wherein users activate their mobile devices if the age of their
messages surpasses a given threshold and remain inactive otherwise. We then
consider strategic content providers (publishers) that offer \emph{bonus
packages} to users, so as to incent them to download updates of advertisement
campaigns. We provide simple algorithms for publishers to determine optimal
bonus levels, leveraging the fact that users adopt their optimal aging control
strategies. The accuracy of our model is validated against traces from the

circular morphologies, suggesting that the emission derives from cool grains
located within the AGB mass-loss regimes. Certain of these halos are found to
have a surface brightness fall-off which may be consistent with secularly
invariant mass-loss within the PNe progenitors. By contrast, the 8.0 {\mu}m
envelopes are detected out to smaller distances from the nuclei, and have a
steeper rate of surface brightness fall-off; a phenomenon which may arise from
changes in the excitation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) within
external photo-dissociation regimes (PDRs). Our 24{\mu}m fluxes are compared to
those in previously published studies, and this appears to indicate that many
of the prior fluxes have been underestimated; a disparity may imply that
previous aperture sizes were too small. We have also combined our 24 {\mu}m

two or more muons, at least one of which seemed to have been produced outside
the beam pipe. We investigate whether similar ""ghost"" events could (and should)
have been seen in already completed experiments. The CDF di-muon data can be
reproduced by a simple model where a relatively light X particle undergoes
four-body decay. This model predicts a large number of ghost events in Fermilab
fixed-target experiments E772, E789 and E866, applying the cuts optimized for
analyses of Drell-Yan events. A correct description of events with more than
two muons requires a more complicated model, where two X particles are produced
from a very broad resonance Y. This model can be tested in fixed-target
experiments only if the cut on the angles, or rapidities, of the muons can be
relaxed. Either way, the UA1 experiment at the CERN ppbar collider should have
observed O(100) ghost events.

regularization based on the L1/Lq norm with q > 1 is attractive in many
applications of regression and classification in that it facilitates group
sparsity in the model. The resulting optimization problem is, however,
challenging to solve due to the structure of the L1/Lq -regularization.
Existing work deals with special cases including q = 2,infinity, and they
cannot be easily extended to the general case. In this paper, we propose an
efficient algorithm based on the accelerated gradient method for solving the
L1/Lq -regularized problem, which is applicable for all values of q larger than

proposed algorithm is the L1/Lq -regularized Euclidean projection (EP1q). Our
theoretical analysis reveals the key properties of EP1q and illustrates why
EP1q for the general q is significantly more challenging to solve than the
special cases. Based on our theoretical analysis, we develop an efficient
algorithm for EP1q by solving two zero finding problems. Experimental results

improve diversity of data bursts on a slotted-ALOHA-like channel thanks to

Slotted Aloha (CRDSA) where the different replicas of this system are replaced
by the different parts of a single word of an error correcting code. The
performance of this scheme is first studied through a density evolution

time frame of $400$ slots, the achievable total throughput is greater than
$0.7\times C$, where $C$ is the maximal throughput achieved by a centralized

several perspectives. The most promising approach is to integrate collided

fits the requirement of practical applications. Moreover, the signaling

velocity data, both the standing acoustic waves and the short-lived,
high-degree running waves are visible. The standing waves are visible as
temporary enhancements of the amplitudes of the large-scale velocity field due
to the stochastic superposition of the acoustic waves. We focus on the
high-degree small-scale waves by suitable filtering in the Fourier domain.
Investigating the propagation and excitation of $f$- and $p_1$-modes with wave

contribute to the excitation of solar $p$-modes in addition to the contribution
of intergranular lanes.

  Vector Machines","Submitted to Journal of Machine Learning Research",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An instance-weighted variant of the support vector machine (SVM) has
attracted considerable attention recently since they are useful in various
machine learning tasks such as non-stationary data analysis, heteroscedastic
data modeling, transfer learning, learning to rank, and transduction. An
important challenge in these scenarios is to overcome the computational
bottleneck---instance weights often change dynamically or adaptively, and thus
the weighted SVM solutions must be repeatedly computed. In this paper, we
develop an algorithm that can efficiently and exactly update the weighted SVM
solutions for arbitrary change of instance weights. Technically, this
contribution can be regarded as an extension of the conventional solution-path
algorithm for a single regularization parameter to multiple instance-weight
parameters. However, this extension gives rise to a significant problem that
breakpoints (at which the solution path turns) have to be identified in
high-dimensional space. To facilitate this, we introduce a parametric
representation of instance weights. We also provide a geometric interpretation
in weight space using a notion of critical region: a polyhedron in which the
current affine solution remains to be optimal. Then we find breakpoints at
intersections of the solution path and boundaries of polyhedrons. Through
extensive experiments on various practical applications, we demonstrate the
usefulness of the proposed algorithm.

also investigate magnetic properties in detail and critically reevaluate the

the way in which the two agents update their states after an interaction. We
show that slightly modifying the NG rules in terms of which agent performs the
update in given circumstances (i.e. after a success) can either alter
dramatically the overall dynamics or leave it qualitatively unchanged. We
understand analytically the first case by casting the model in the broader
framework of a generalized NG. As for the second case, on the other hand, we
note that the modified rule reproducing the main features of the usual NG
corresponds in fact to a simplification of it consisting in the elimination of
feedback between the agents. This allows us to introduce and study a very
natural broadcasting scheme on networks that can be potentially relevant for
different applications, such as the design and implementation of autonomous
sensor networks, as pointed out in the recent literature.

Despite recent advances in higly performant methods, it is very difficult to
obtain direct information on conformational changes of molecules. However,
several systems exist that can shed some light on the variability of
conformations of a single peptide chain; among them, NMR methods provide
collections of a number of static 'shots' of a moving protein. Starting from
this data, and assuming that if a protein exists in more than 1 conformation it
must be able to transit between the different states, we have elaborated a
system that makes ample use of the computational power of 3D computer graphics
technology. Considering information of all (heavy) atoms, we use animation and
game engine of Blender to obtain transition states. The model we chose to
elaborate our system is Calmodulin, a protein favorite among structural and
dynamic studies due to its (relative) simplicity of structure and small
dimension. Using Calmodulin we show a procedure that enables the building of a
'navigation map' of NMR models, that can help in the identification of
movements. In the process, a number of intermediate conformations is generated,
all of which respond to strict bio-physical and bio-chemical criteria. The

infinity. We prove that the limiting proportion of escapes to infinity equals
the escape probability for random walk, provided only finitely many rotors send
the walker initially towards the root. For i.i.d. random initial rotor
directions on a regular tree, the limiting proportion of escapes is either zero

transition between the two as the distribution is varied. In the critical case
there are no escapes, but the walker's maximum distance from the root grows
doubly exponentially with the number of visits to the root. We also prove that
there exist trees of bounded degree for which the proportion of escapes

between dopants and vacancy defects leads to a significant fraction of trapped
vacancies and therefore a dramatic reduction of the number of free vacancies
available for diffusion. The concentration of free vacancies initially
increases with dopant concentration, but reaches a maximum at around 1 mol% Li
doping and slowly decreases with further doping. At the optimal level of
doping, the corresponding concentration of free vacancies is much higher than
the equilibrium concentrations of charged and neutral vacancies in pure MgH2 at
typical hydrogen storage conditions. We also show that Li-doped MgH2 is
thermodynamically metastable with respect to phase separation into pure
magnesium and lithium hydrides at any significant Li concentration, even after
considering the stabilization provided by dopant-vacancy interactions and

fermion fields in a Lifshitz-type Yukawa model, after dressing by quantum
fluctuations. Relativistic-like dispersion relations emerge dynamically in the
IR regime of the model, after quantum corrections are taken into account. In
this regime, dynamical mass generation also takes place, but in such a way that
the particle excitations remain massive, even if the bare masses vanish. The
group velocities of the corresponding massive particles of course are smaller
than the speed of light, in a way consistent with the IR regime where the
analysis is performed. We also comment on possible extensions of the model
where the fermions are coupled to an Abelian gauge field.

endogenous bubbles. A major open issue is to verify the presence of LPPL in
price sequences and to estimate the LPPL parameters. Estimation is complicated
by the fact that daily LPPL returns are typically orders of magnitude smaller
than measured price returns, suggesting that noise obscures the underlying LPPL
dynamics. However, if noise is mean-reverting, it would quickly cancel out over
subsequent measurements. In this paper, we attempt to reject mean-reverting
noise from price sequences by exploiting frequency-domain properties of LPPL
and of mean reversion. First, we calculate the spectrum of mean-reverting \ou
noise and devise estimators for the noise's parameters. Then, we derive the
LPPL spectrum by breaking it down into its two main characteristics of power
law and of log-periodicity. We compare price spectra with noise spectra during
historical bubbles. In general, noise was strong also at low frequencies and,
even if LPPL underlied price dynamics, LPPL would be obscured by noise.

for the generation of sample paths of Feller processes. The construction is
based on state space dependent mixing of L\'evy processes.
  Brownian Motion is one of the most frequently used continuous time Markov
processes in applications. In recent years also L\'evy processes, of which
Brownian Motion is a special case, have become increasingly popular.
  L\'evy processes are spatially homogeneous, but empirical data often suggest
the use of spatially inhomogeneous processes. Thus it seems necessary to go to
the next level of generalization: Feller processes. These include L\'evy
processes and in particular Brownian motion as special cases but allow spatial
inhomogeneities.
  Many properties of Feller processes are known, but proving the very existence
is, in general, very technical. Moreover, an applicable framework for the
generation of sample paths of a Feller process was missing. We explain, with
practitioners in mind, how to overcome both of these obstacles. In particular
our simulation technique allows to apply Monte Carlo methods to Feller
processes.

realized by increasing $Pd$ concentration. The AF transition T_M decreases from

originating from the non-trivial topological structure associated to the

conventional systems, have led to the prediction of many striking phenomena,
such as gate-tunable ferromagnetism and valley-selective transport. In most

of edge modes to the conductance of realistic devices remains sizable even for
highly imperfect edges. This edge conductance dominates over the bulk
contribution if the electrostatically induced gap is sufficiently large, and
accounts for seemingly conflicting observations made in recent transport and
optical spectroscopy experiments. Our results illustrate the robustness of
phenomena whose origin is rooted in the topology of the electronic

scale, the resulting principal component decomposition demonstrates that the
whole sample is properly approximated using two components. The ratio of the
second to the first component is related to the halo steepness in the central
region, is correlated to the gas fraction in the galaxy, and is un-correlated
to other parameters. As a consequence the gas fraction appear as a fundamental
variable with respect to the galaxies rotation curves, and its correlation with
the halo steepness is especially important. Since the gas fraction is related
to the degree of galaxy evolution, it is very likely that the steepness of the
halo at the center is a consequence of galaxy evolution. More evolved galaxies
have shallower central profile and statistically less gas, most likely as a
consequence of more star formation and supernovae. The differences in

due to the influence of different environments.

Sextans dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph). Our final sample consists of 174
probable members of Sextans with accurate line-of-sight velocities (+- 2 km/s)
and CaT [Fe/H] measurements (+- 0.2 dex). We use the MgI line at 8806.8 \AA\,
as an empirical discriminator for distinguishing between probable members of
the dSph (giant stars) and probable Galactic contaminants (dwarf stars).
Sextans shows a similar chemo-dynamical behaviour to other Milky Way dSphs,
with its central regions being more metal rich than the outer parts and with
the more metal-rich stars displaying colder kinematics than the more metal-poor
stars. Hints of a velocity gradient are found along the projected major axis
and along an axis at P.A.=191 deg, however a larger and more spatially extended
sample may be necessary to pin down the amplitude and direction of this
gradient. We detect a cold kinematic substructure at the centre of Sextans,
consistent with being the remnant of a disrupted very metal poor stellar
cluster. We derive the most extended line-of-sight velocity dispersion profile
for Sextans, out to a projected radius of 1.6 deg. From Jeans modelling of the
observed line-of-sight velocity dispersion profile we find that this is
consistent with both a cored dark matter halo with large core radius and cuspy
halo with low concentration. The mass within the last measured point is in the
range 2-4 x 10^8 M_sun, giving very large mass-to-light ratios, from 460 to 920
(M/L)_(V,sun).

introduction of defects into its perfect lattice. Energetic ions provide one
way of achieving this challenging goal. Single heavy ions with kinetic energies
in the 100 MeV range will produce nanometer-sized defects on dielectric but
generally not on crystalline metal surfaces. In a metal the ion-induced
electronic excitations are efficiently dissipated by the conduction electrons
before the transfer of energy to the lattice atoms sets in. Therefore, graphene
is not expected to be irradiation sensitive beyond the creation of point
defects. Here we show that graphene on a dielectric substrate sustains major
modifications if irradiated under oblique angles. Due to a combination of
defect creation in the graphene layer and hillock creation in the substrate,
graphene is split and folded along the ion track yielding double layer
nanoribbons. Our results indicate that the radiation hardness of graphene
devices is questionable but also open up a new way of introducing extended
low-dimensional defects in a controlled way.

two-component lipid membranes on the experimentally relevant spatial scales of
order of a micrometer and time intervals of order of a second, using DMPC/DSPC
lipid mixtures as a model system. Our large-scale simulations allowed us to
obtain important results previously not reported in simulation studies of lipid
membranes. We find that, within a certain range of lipid compositions, the
phase transition from the fluid phase to the fluid-gel phase coexistence
proceeds via near-critical fluctuations, while for other lipid compositions
this phase transition has a quasi-abrupt character. In the presence of
near-critical fluctuations, transient subdiffusion of lipid molecules is
observed. These features of the system are stable with respect to perturbations
in lipid interaction parameters used in our simulations. The line tension
characterizing lipid domains in the fluid-gel coexistence region is found to be
in the pN range. When approaching the critical point, the line tension, the
inverse correlation length of fluid-gel spatial fluctuations, and the
corresponding inverse order parameter susceptibility of the membrane vanish.
All these results are in agreement with recent experimental findings for model
lipid membranes. Our analysis of the domain coarsening dynamics after an abrupt
quench of the membrane to the fluid-gel coexistence region reveals that lateral
diffusion of lipids plays an important role in the fluid-gel phase separation
process.

with obstacles in a magnetic field. We show that it is not guaranteed that
equilibrium is attained within the typical time scales of microscopic dynamics.
Indeed, considering an out of equilibrium state produced by an adiabatic

120 load sensors and 29 passive infrared sensors (PIRs), connected to 30
wireless sensor nodes. There are also 29 LEDs and speakers installed, operating
as actuators, and enabling a direct interaction between the testbed and
passers-by. Beyond that, the network is heterogeneous, consisting of three
different circuit boards---each with its specific responsibility. The design of
the load sensors is of extremely low cost compared to industrial solutions and
easily transferred to other settings. The network is used for in-network data
processing algorithms, offering possibilities to develop, for instance,
distributed target-tracking algorithms. Special features of our installation
are highly correlated sensor data and the availability of miscellaneous sensor
types.

threads of solar prominences/filaments and have been interpreted as kink
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modes. We investigate the spatial damping of
propagating kink MHD waves in transversely nonuniform and partially ionized
prominence threads. Resonant absorption and ion-neutral collisions (Cowling's
diffusion) are the damping mechanisms taken into account. The dispersion
relation of resonant kink waves in a partially ionized magnetic flux tube is
numerically solved by considering prominence conditions. Analytical expressions
of the wavelength and damping length as functions of the kink mode frequency
are obtained in the Thin Tube and Thin Boundary approximations. For typically
reported periods of thread oscillations, resonant absorption is an efficient
mechanism for the kink mode spatial damping, while ion-neutral collisions have
a minor role. Cowling's diffusion dominates both the propagation and damping
for periods much shorter than those observed. Resonant absorption may explain
the observed spatial damping of kink waves in prominence threads. The
transverse inhomogeneity length scale of the threads can be estimated by
comparing the observed wavelengths and damping lengths with the theoretically
predicted values. However, the ignorance of the form of the density profile in
the transversely nonuniform layer introduces inaccuracies in the determination
of the inhomogeneity length scale.

form reduces the computation of the flux-flux correlation function to that of
an effective one dimensional anharmonic barrier. The example of the computation
of the quantum flux-flux correlation function for a fourth order anharmonic

been the focus of many-body research for a century. Yet much of the richness of
the world around us arises from conditions far from equilibrium. Phenomena such
as turbulence, earthquakes, fracture, and life itself occur only far from
equilibrium. Subjecting materials to conditions far from equilibrium leads to
otherwise unattainable properties. For example, rapid cooling is a key process
in manufacturing the strongest metallic alloys and toughest plastics. Processes
that occur far from equilibrium also create some of the most intricate
structures known, from snowflakes to the highly organized structures of life.
While much is understood about systems at or near equilibrium, we are just
beginning to uncover the basic principles governing systems far from
equilibrium.

with photons -- prominent examples are axions, axion-like particles and extra
``hidden'' U(1) gauge bosons -- are light-shining-through-a-wall (LSW)
experiments. With the current generation of these experiments finishing data
taking it is time to plan for the next and search for an optimal setup. The
main challenges are clear: on the one hand we want to improve the sensitivity
towards smaller couplings, on the other hand we also want to increase the mass
range to which the experiments are sensitive. Our main example are axion(-like
particle)s but we also discuss implications for other WISPs (weakly interacting
slim particles) such as hidden U(1) gauge bosons. To improve the sensitivity
for axions towards smaller couplings one can use multiple magnets to increase
the length of the interaction region. However, naively the price to pay is that
the mass range is limited to smaller masses. We discuss how one can optimize
the arrangement of magnets (both in field direction as well as allowing for
possible gaps in between) to ameliorate this problem. Moreover, future
experiments will include resonant, high quality optical cavities in both the
production and the regeneration region. To achieve the necessary high quality
of the cavities we need to avoid too high diffraction losses. This leads to
minimum requirements on the diameter of the laser beam and therefore on the
aperture of the cavity. We investigate what can be achieved with currently
available magnets and desirable features for future ones.

radiation gauge; more precisely, the method uses a radiation gauge for the
radiative part of the metric perturbation, together with an arbitrarily chosen
gauge for the parts of the perturbation associated with changes in black-hole
mass and spin and with a shift in the center of mass. We compute the
conservative part of the self-force for a particle in circular orbit around a
Schwarzschild black hole. The gauge vector relating our radiation gauge to a
Lorenz gauge is helically symmetric, implying that the quantity h_{\alpha\beta}
u^\alpha u^\beta (= h_{uu}) must have the same value for our radiation gauge as
for a Lorenz gauge; and we confirm this numerically to one part in 10^{13}. As
outlined in the first paper, the perturbed metric is constructed from a Hertz
potential that is in term obtained algebraically from the the retarded
perturbed spin-2 Weyl scalar, \psi_0 . We use a mode-sum renormalization and
find the renormalization coefficients by matching a series in L = \ell + 1/2 to
the large-L behavior of the expression for the self-force in terms of the
retarded field h_{\alpha\beta}^{ret}; we similarly find the leading
renormalization coefficients of h_{uu} and the related change in the angular
velocity of the particle due to its self-force. We show numerically that the
singular part of the self-force has the form f_{\alpha} \propto < \nabla_\alpha
\rho^{-1}>, the part of \nabla_\alpha \rho^{-1} that is axisymmetric about a
radial line through the particle. This differs only by a constant from its form
for a Lorenz gauge. It is because we do not use a radiation gauge to describe
the change in black-hole mass that the singular part of the self-force has no
singularity along a radial line through the particle and, at least in this
example, is spherically symmetric to subleading order in \rho.

hot DA white dwarfs observed by the FUSE satellite. We have carried out a
detailed analysis of the radial velocities of interstellar and (where present)
stellar absorption lines for the entire sample of stars. In approximately 35%
of cases (where photospheric material is detected), the velocity differences
between the interstellar and photospheric components were beneath the
resolution of the FUSE spectrographs. Therefore, in 65% of these stars the
interstellar and photospheric contributions could be separated and the nature
of the O VI component unambiguously determined. Furthermore, in other examples,
where the spectra were of a high signal-to-noise, no photospheric material was
found and any O VI detected was assumed to be interstellar. Building on the
earlier work of Oegerle et al. (2005) and Savage & Lehner (2006), we have
increased the number of detections of interstellar O VI and, for the first
time, compared their locations with both the soft X-ray background emission and
new detailed maps of the distribution of neutral gas within the local
interstellar medium. We find no strong evidence to support a spatial
correlation between O VI and SXRB emission. In all but a few cases, the
interstellar O VI was located at or beyond the boundaries of the local cavity.
Hence, any T ~ 300,000K gas responsible for the O VI absorption may reside at
the interface between the cavity and surrounding medium or in that medium
itself. Consequently, it appears that there is much less O VI-bearing gas than
previously stated within the inner rarefied regions of the local interstellar
cavity.
