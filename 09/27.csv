approximately from a probability distribution D_x. In a search problem, we are
given an input x, and asked to find a member of a nonempty set A_x with high
probability. (An example is finding a Nash equilibrium.) In this paper, we use
tools from Kolmogorov complexity and algorithmic information theory to show
that sampling and search problems are essentially equivalent. More precisely,
for any sampling problem S, there exists a search problem R_S such that, if C
is any ""reasonable"" complexity class, then R_S is in the search version of C if
and only if S is in the sampling version. As one application, we show that
SampP=SampBQP if and only if FBPP=FBQP: in other words, classical computers can
efficiently sample the output distribution of every quantum circuit, if and
only if they can efficiently solve every search problem that quantum computers
can solve. A second application is that, assuming a plausible conjecture, there
exists a search problem R that can be solved using a simple linear-optics
experiment, but that cannot be solved efficiently by a classical computer
unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses. That application will be described
in a forthcoming paper with Alex Arkhipov on the computational complexity of
linear optics.

using the direct simulation Monte Carlo method for a single component

lower boundary of the simulation region, R0, and well below the exobase, this
transition is shown to occur over a surprisingly narrow range of Jeans

2.1 roughly corresponds to the upper limit for isentropic, supersonic outflow

objective of this study is to determine the best combination of sampling and
full width at half maximum (FWHM) for the OSIRIS tunable filters for deblending
H\alpha from [NII] lines by analyzing the flux errors obtained. We simulated
the OTELO data by convolving a complete set of synthetic HII galaxies in EW
with different widths of the OSIRIS TFs. We estimated relative flux errors of
the recovered H\alpha and [NII]6583 lines. We found that, for the red TF, a
FWHM of 12 A and a sampling of 5 A is an optimal combination that allow
deblending H\alpha from the [NII]6583 line with a flux error lower than 20%.
This combination will allow estimating SFRs and metallicities using the H\alpha
flux and the N2 method, respectively.

that common errors are corrected: in particular, the classical field of
electromagnetic energy is often, wrongly, considered as linear, so that Bohr's
electron falls on the nucleus and photon counting is false. Using absolute

quantizes ""normal modes"" chosen arbitrarily among the infinity of sets of

Considering the photons as small particles interacting without pilot waves with

physical mechanisms acting in most of the solar interior, the microscopic and
dynamics of the deep core is still not well understood. Helioseismological
anomalies may be partially resolved if the Sun captures light, non-annihilating
dark matter particles, a currently discussed dark matter candidate that is
motivated by recent direct detection limits. Once trapped, such particles (4-10
GeV) naturally fill the solar core. With the use of a well-defined stellar
evolution code that takes into account an accurate description of the capture
of dark matter particles by the Sun, we investigate the impact of such
particles in its inner core. Even a relatively small amount of dark matter
particles in the solar core will leave an imprint on the absolute frequency
values of gravity modes, as well as the equidistant spacing between modes of
the same degree. The period separation for gravity modes could reveal changes
of up to 3% for annihilating dark matter and of up to 20% for non-annihilating
dark matter. This effect is most pronounced in the case of the gravity dipole
(l=1) modes.

asymptotically the usual static de Sitter temperature. Furthermore, it is
proven that during radiation-dominance and in late times the CEH conforms to

communication. Today, however, more than a decade after its initial
experimental realization, the channel capacity remains fundamentally limited as
conceived for photons using linear elements. Bob can only send to Alice three
of four potential messages owing to the impossibility of carrying out the
deterministic discrimination of all four Bell states with linear optics,
reducing the attainable channel capacity from 2 to log_2 3 \approx 1.585 bits.
However, entanglement in an extra degree of freedom enables the complete and
deterministic discrimination of all Bell states. Using pairs of photons
simultaneously entangled in spin and orbital angular momentum, we demonstrate
the quantum advantage of the ancillary entanglement. In particular, we describe
a dense-coding experiment with the largest reported channel capacity and, to
our knowledge, the first to break the conventional linear-optics threshold. Our
encoding is suited for quantum communication without alignment and satellite

including an anisotropic scattering law for further developing this dynamical
Monte Carlo simulation. Under this extended anisotropic scattering law, a
Gaussian distribution function is used to describe the variation of scattering
angles in the particle's local frame. As a result, we obtain a series of
different shock structures and evolutions in terms of the standard deviation

first sequentially broadcast their respective information to all the relays. We
propose two RS schemes, a single relay selection with NC and a dual relay
selection with NC. For both schemes, the selected relay(s) perform NC on the
received signals sent from the two users and forward them to both users. The
proposed schemes are analyzed and the exact bit error rate (BER) expressions
are derived and verified through Monte Carlo simulations. It is shown that the
dual relay selection with NC outperforms other considered relay selection
schemes in two-way relay channels. The results also reveal that the proposed NC
relay selection schemes provide a selection gain compared to a NC scheme with
no relay selection, and a network coding gain relative to a conventional relay

wireless networks enhances the overall quality of communication in the network.
Such coordinations for optimizing any desired network-wide quality of service
(QoS) necessitate the base stations to acquire and share some channel state
information (CSI). With perfect knowledge of channel states, the base stations
can adjust their transmissions for achieving a network-wise QoS optimality. In
practice, however, the CSI can be obtained only imperfectly. As a result, due
to the uncertainties involved, the network is not guaranteed to benefit from a
globally optimal QoS. Nevertheless, if the channel estimation perturbations are
confined within bounded regions, the QoS measure will also lie within a bounded
region. Therefore, by exploiting the notion of robustness in the worst-case
sense some worst-case QoS guarantees for the network can be asserted. We adopt
a popular model for noisy channel estimates that assumes that estimation noise
terms lie within known hyper-spheres. We aim to design linear transceivers that
optimize a worst-case QoS measure in downlink transmissions. In particular, we
focus on maximizing the worst-case weighted sum-rate of the network and the
minimum worst-case rate of the network. For obtaining such transceiver designs,
we offer several centralized (fully cooperative) and distributed (limited
cooperation) algorithms which entail different levels of complexity and
information exchange among the base stations.

quantum mechanics, rest on the foundations of probability and entropy. The last
century saw several significant fundamental advances in our understanding of
the process of inference, which make it clear that these are inferential
theories. That is, rather than being a description of the behavior of the
universe, these theories describe how observers can make optimal predictions
about the universe. In such a picture, information plays a critical role. What
is more is that little clues, such as the fact that black holes have entropy,
continue to suggest that information is fundamental to physics in general.
  In the last decade, our fundamental understanding of probability theory has
led to a Bayesian revolution. In addition, we have come to recognize that the
foundations go far deeper and that Cox's approach of generalizing a Boolean
algebra to a probability calculus is the first specific example of the more
fundamental idea of assigning valuations to partially-ordered sets. By
considering this as a natural way to introduce quantification to the more
fundamental notion of ordering, one obtains an entirely new way of deriving
physical laws. I will introduce this new way of thinking by demonstrating how
one can quantify partially-ordered sets and, in the process, derive physical
laws. The implication is that physical law does not reflect the order in the
universe, instead it is derived from the order imposed by our description of
the universe. Information physics, which is based on understanding the ways in
which we both quantify and process information about the world around us, is a
fundamentally new approach to science.

solar atmosphere is not possible due to unavailability of the observations at
different heights and also due to non-uniqueness of {\bf A}. The force-free
parameter $\alpha$ has been used as a proxy of magnetic helicity for a long
time. We have clarified the physical meaning of $\alpha$ and its relationship
with the magnetic helicity. We have studied the effect of polarimetric noise on
estimation of various magnetic parameters. Fine structures of sunspots in terms
of vertical current ($J_z$) and $\alpha$ have been examined. We have introduced
the concept of signed shear angle (SSA) for sunspots and established its
importance for non force-free fields. We find that there is no net current in
sunspots even in presence of a significant twist, showing consistency with
their fibril-bundle nature. The finding of existence of a lower limit of SASSA
for a given class of X-ray flare will be very useful for space weather
forecasting. A good correlation is found between the sign of helicity in the
sunspots and the chirality of the associated chromospheric and coronal
features. We find that a large number of sunspots observed in the declining
phase of solar cycle 23 do not follow the hemispheric helicity rule whereas
most of the sunspots observed in the beginning of new solar cycle 24 do follow.
This indicates a long term behaviour of the hemispheric helicity patterns in

photospheric vector field measurements with high resolution are needed to
examine the force-free nature of sunspots. We use high resolution vector
magnetograms obtained from the Solar Optical Telescope/Spectro-Polarimeter
(SOT/SP) aboard Hinode to inspect the force-free behaviour of the photospheric
sunspot magnetic fields. Both the necessary and sufficient conditions for
force-freeness are examined by checking global as well as as local nature of
sunspot magnetic fields. We find that the sunspot magnetic fields are very
close to the force-free approximation, although they are not completely
force-free on the photosphere.

reheating temperature, which is estimated by the stability condition of

is lower than the mass of gravitino. Therefore no thermal reproduction of
gravitinos happens. The ratio between the scalar and tensor power spectrum is
predicted to be almost the same for the seven cases under study, and its value
$r \sim 6.8 \times 10^{-2}$ seems in the range possibly observed by the Planck

Chandrasekhar limit through accretion of matter transferred from its companion
star in a binary) and the double degenerate scenario (the inspiraling and
merging of two white dwarfs in a binary as a result of the emission of
gravitational wave radiation). A population number synthesis code is used,
which includes the latest physical results in binary evolution and allows to
differentiate between certain physical scenarios (such as the description of
common envelope evolution) and evolutionary parameters (such as the mass
transfer efficiency during Roche lobe overflow). The thus obtained theoretical
distributions of type Ia supernova delay times are compared to those that are
observed, both in morphological shape and absolute number of events. The
critical influence of certain parameters on these distributions is used to
constrain their values. The single degenerate scenario alone is found to be
unable in reproducing the morphological shape of the observational delay time
distribution, while use of the double degenerate one (or a combination of both)
does result in fair agreement. Most double degenerate type Ia supernovae are
formed through a normal, quasi-conservative Roche lobe overflow followed by a
common envelope phase, not through two successive common envelope phases as is
often assumed. This may cast doubt on the determination of delay times by using
analytical formalisms, as is sometimes done in other studies. The theoretical
absolute number of events in old elliptical galaxies lies a factor of at least
three below the rates that are observed. While this may simply be the result of
observational uncertainties, a better treatment of the effects of rotation on
stellar structure could mitigate the discrepancy.

the prompt optical emission observed in several bursts. Through Monte Carlo
simulations, we model such low-energy spectral excess components as hadronic
cascade emission initiated by photomeson interactions of ultra-high-energy
protons accelerated within GRB outflows. Synchrotron radiation from the
cascading, secondary electron-positron pairs can naturally reproduce the

as well. These components can be directly related to the higher energy
radiation at GeV energies due to the hadronic cascades. Depending on the
spectral shape, the total energy in protons is required to be comparable to or
appreciably larger than the observed total photon energy. In particular, we
apply our model to the excess X-ray and GeV emission of GRB 090902B, and the
bright optical emission of the ""naked-eye"" GRB 080319B. Besides the hard GeV

within the radius for which the velocity dispersion is measured. We find that
the sizes and stellar masses are tightly correlated, with Re ~ M*^{1.1}$,
making the mean density within the de Vaucouleurs radius a steeply declining
function of M*: rho_e ~ M*^{-2.2}. These scalings are easily derived from the
virial theorem if one recalls that this sample has essentially fixed (but
large) sigma_0. In contrast, the mean density within 1 kpc is almost
independent of M*, at a value that is in good agreement with recent studies of
z ~ 2 galaxies. The fact that the mass within 1 kpc has remained approximately
unchanged suggests assembly histories that were dominated by minor mergers --
but we discuss why this is not the unique way to achieve this. Moreover, the
total stellar mass of the objects in our sample is typically a factor of ~ 5
larger than that in the high redshift (z ~ 2) sample, an amount which seems
difficult to achieve. If our galaxies are the evolved objects of the recent
high redshift studies, then we suggest that major mergers were required at z >
1.5, and that minor mergers become the dominant growth mechanism for massive
galaxies at z < 1.5.

arrays of cylindrical pillars, the elastic deformation of the patterns can lead
to noticeable extra adhesion increase. The effect of the geometrical
characteristics of the patterning for hexagonal arrays of PDMS micropillars on
the adhesion energy are presented. We show that varying the size of the pattern
allows one to tune the adhesion energy, and that this adhesion enhancement
saturates when the pillars become too close to each other, due a coupling of
the elastic deformation fields inside the underlying substrate. A mechanical
model has been developed and found in good quantitative agreement with
experimental data, with as unique fitting parameter the rupture criteria for
the adhesive on the top of the pillars. Such a rupture a rupture criteria can
thus be extracted from systematic experiments on controlled patterned surfaces.
This criteria remain sensitive to the chemistry of the surfaces.

gaseous disks. We find that a vortex core, orbiting at the local gas velocity,
induces velocity perturbations that propagate away from the vortex as density
waves. The resulting spiral wave pattern is reminiscent of an embedded planet.
There are two main causes for asymmetries in these wakes: geometrical effects
tend to favor the outer wave, while a radial vortensity gradient leads to an
asymmetric vortex core, which favors the wave at the side that has the lowest
density. In the case of asymmetric waves, which we always find except for a
disk of constant pressure, there is a net exchange of angular momentum between
the vortex and the surrounding disk, which leads to orbital migration of the
vortex. Numerical hydrodynamical simulations show that this migration can be
very rapid, on a time scale of a few thousand orbits, for vortices with a size
comparable to the scale height of the disk. We discuss the possible effects of
vortex migration on planet formation scenarios.

signature of solar coronal heating mechanisms by MHD wave dissipation. Images
were taken in white- light and Fe XIV green-line (5303 A) channels over 205
seconds (frame rate 39 s-1), approximately the length of eclipse totality at
this location, with a pixel size of four arcseconds square. The data are of
considerably better quality than were obtained during the 11 August 1999 total
eclipse, observed by us (Rudawy et al.: Astron. Astrophys. 416, 1179, 2004), in
that the images are much better exposed and enhancements in the drive system of
the heliostat used gave a much improved image stability. Classical Fourier and
wavelet techniques have been used to analyze the emission at 29518 locations,
of which 10714 had emission at reasonably high levels, searching for periodic
fluctuations with periods in the range 0.1-17 seconds (frequencies 0.06-10 Hz).
While a number of possible periodicities were apparent in the wavelet analysis,
none of the spatially and time-limited periodicities in the local brightness
curves was found to be physically important. This implies that the pervasive
Alfven wave-like phenomena (Tomczyk et al.: Science 317, 1192, 2007) using
polarimetric observations with the CoMP instrument do not give rise to
significant oscillatory intensity fluctuations.

detailed balance with respect to a Hamiltonian with {\it long-range

be used to compute the execution instants along some directions in the state

along every direction in the state space. Moreover, we also show in this paper
how to homogenize smooth control systems thus making our results applicable to
any smooth control system. The benefits of the proposed approach with respect

basic properties of quantum plasmas, we present model equations (e.g. the
quantum hydrodynamic and effective nonlinear Schr\""odinger-Poisson equations)
that describe collective nonlinear phenomena at nanoscales. The effects of the
electron degeneracy arise due to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and Pauli's
exclusion principle for overlapping electron wavefunctions that result in
tunneling of electrons and the electron degeneracy pressure. Since electrons
are Fermions (spin-1/2), there also appears an electron spin current and a spin
force acting on electrons due to the Bohr magnetization. The quantum effects
produce new aspects of electrostatic (ES) and electromagnetic (EM) waves in a
quantum plasma that are summarized in here. Furthermore, we discuss nonlinear
features of ES ion waves and electron plasma oscillations (ESOs), as well as
the trapping of intense EM waves in quantum electron density cavities.
Specifically, simulation studies of the coupled nonlinear Schr\""odinger (NLS)
and Poisson equations reveal the formation and dynamics of localized ES
structures at nanoscales in a quantum plasma. We also discuss the effect of an
external magnetic field on the plasma wave spectra and develop quantum
magnetohydrodynamic (Q-MHD) equations. The results are useful for understanding

LLC sample are in general consistent with brighter CSS and large-scale radio
sources, although the LLC objects have lower values of [OIII] luminosity than
the more powerful CSS sources (L_1.4GHz>10^25 W/Hz). However, when LLC are
added to the other samples, HEG and LEG seem to follow independent, parallel
evolutionary tracks. Regarding ionization mechanisms, LLC and luminous CSS
objects behave like FRII sources, while FRI seem to belong to a different group

densities on the resulting phase diagram of the model. Our current model is
able to reproduce a first-order liquid gas phase transition as expected, but

unwarranted assumptions about density perturbations. The prospects of confident
detection of relic gravitational waves by the Planck satellite have worsened,
but they are still good. It appears that more effort will be required in order
to mitigate the foreground contamination.

strength of cooling magnetic field (Hcool). The values of exchange bias
parameter i.e. exchange bias fields (HE), coercivity (HC), remanence asymmetry
(ME) and magnetic coercivity (MC) are found to strongly depend on Hcool. The
larger effective magnetic moments and deviation of inverse susceptibility
(\c{hi}-1) from Curie-Weiss law indicate the possible existence of Griffiths
phase (GP). A rigorous measurement of linear and nonlinear ac and dc magnetic
susceptibility in nanomanganites proves the existence of Griffiths phase (GP)
in the temperature range TC<T<TG (Griffiths temperature). The effect of size
reduction on exchange bias effect and GP is addressed here. The enhancement of

individual linear spaces in urban environments. The least number of axial lines
that cover the free space of an urban environment or the space between
buildings constitute what is often called an axial map. This is a fundamental
tool in space syntax, a theory developed by Bill Hillier and his colleagues for
characterizing the underlying urban morphologies. For a long time, generating
axial lines with help of some graphic software has been a tedious manual
process that is criticized for being time consuming, subjective, or even
arbitrary. In this paper, we redefine axial lines as the least number of
individual straight line segments mutually intersected along natural streets
that are generated from street center lines using the Gestalt principle of good
continuity. Based on this new definition, we develop an automatic solution to
generating the newly defined axial lines from street center lines. We apply
this solution to six typical street networks (three from North America and
three from Europe), and generate a new set of axial lines for analyzing the
urban morphologies. Through a comparison study between the new axial lines and
the conventional or old axial lines, and between the new axial lines and
natural streets, we demonstrate with empirical evidence that the newly defined
axial lines are a better alternative in capturing the underlying urban
structure.

  Sources along Proper Decoding Paths","19 pages, 4 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information
  Theory",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Distributed Arithmetic Coding (DAC) is an effective implementation of
Slepian-Wolf coding, especially for short data blocks. To research its
properties, the concept of DAC codeword distribution along proper and wrong
decoding paths has been introduced. For DAC codeword distribution of
equiprobable binary sources along proper decoding paths, the problem was
formatted as solving a system of functional equations. However, up to now, only
one closed form was obtained at rate 0.5, while in general cases, to find the
closed form of DAC codeword distribution still remains a very difficult task.
This paper proposes three kinds of approximation methods for DAC codeword
distribution of equiprobable binary sources along proper decoding paths:
numeric approximation, polynomial approximation, and Gaussian approximation.
Firstly, as a general approach, a numeric method is iterated to find the
approximation to DAC codeword distribution. Secondly, at rates lower than 0.5,
DAC codeword distribution can be well approximated by a polynomial. Thirdly, at
very low rates, a Gaussian function centered at 0.5 is proved to be a good and
simple approximation to DAC codeword distribution. A simple way to estimate the
variance of Gaussian function is also proposed. Plenty of simulation results
are given to verify theoretical analyses.

and similar lenticular one, we show that cool gas detection rates are very
similar among low luminosity E and SO galaxies but are much higher among
luminous S0s. Using the combined sample we revisit the correlation between cool
gas mass and blue luminosity which emerged from our lenticular survey, finding
strong support for previous claims that the molecular gas in ellipticals and
lenticulars has different origins. Unexpectedly, however, and contrary to
earlier claims, the same is not true for atomic gas. We speculate that both the
AGN feedback and merger paradigms might offer explanations for differences in
detection rates, and might also point towards an understanding of why the two
gas phases could follow different evolutionary paths in Es and S0s. Finally we
present a new and puzzling discovery concerning the global mix of atomic and
molecular gas in early type galaxies. Atomic gas comprises a greater fraction
of the cool ISM in more gas rich galaxies, a trend which can be plausibly
explained. The puzzle is that galaxies tend to cluster around
molecular-to-atomic gas mass ratios near either 0.05 or 0.5.

due to intensity fluctuations (scintillation) produced by the Earth's
atmosphere. Here we describe a method to reduce the effects of scintillation by
a combination of pupil reconjugation and calibration using a comparison star.
Because scintillation is produced by high altitude turbulence, the range of
angles over which the scintillation is correlated is small and therefore simple
correction by a comparison star is normally impossible. We propose
reconjugating the telescope pupil to a high dominant layer of turbulence, then
apodizing it before calibration with a comparison star. We find by simulation
that given a simple atmosphere with a single high altitude turbulent layer and
a strong surface layer a reduction in the intensity variance by a factor of ~30
is possible. Given a more realistic atmosphere as measured by SCIDAR at San
Pedro M\'artir we find that on a night with a strong high altitude layer we can
expect the median variance to be reduced by a factor of 11. By reducing the
scintillation noise we will be able to detect much smaller changes in
brightness. If we assume a 2 m telescope and an exposure time of 30 seconds a
reduction in the scintillation noise from 0.78 mmag to 0.21 mmag is possible,
which will enable the routine detection of, for example, the secondary transits
of extrasolar planets from the ground.

translate (i.e., to move without rotation or change of shape) the hyperplane
according to the distribution of the entire data. But existing work can only be
applied for 1-D case. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient method
called General Scaled SVM (GS-SVM) to extend the existing approach to
multi-dimensional case. Our method translates the hyperplane according to the
distribution of data projected on the normal vector of the hyperplane. Compared
with C-SVM, GS-SVM has better performance on several data sets.

compound systems from the knowledge of an elementary Hamiltonian. Our framework
provides a well-controlled nonperturbative calculational scheme which can be
systematically improved. The state vector of a physical system is calculated in
light-front dynamics. From the general properties of this form of dynamics, the
state vector can be further decomposed in well-defined Fock components. In
order to control the convergence of this expansion, we advocate the use of the
covariant formulation of light-front dynamics. In this formulation, the state
vector is projected on an arbitrary light-front plane $\omega \cd x=0$ defined
by a light-like four-vector $\omega$. This enables us to control any violation
of rotational invariance due to the truncation of the Fock expansion. We then
present a general nonperturbative renormalization scheme in order to avoid
field-theoretical divergences which may remain uncancelled due to this
truncation. This general framework has been applied to a large variety of
models. As a starting point, we consider QED for the two-body Fock space
truncation and calculate the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron. We show
that it coincides, in this approximation, with the well-known Schwinger term.
Then we investigate the properties of a purely scalar system in the three-body
approximation, where we highlight the role of antiparticle degrees of freedom.
As a non-trivial example of our framework, we calculate the structure of a
physical fermion in the Yukawa model, for the three-body Fock space truncation
(but still without antifermion contributions). We finally show why our approach
is also well-suited to describe effective field theories like chiral
perturbation theory in the baryonic sector.

molecule in the interstellar medium cannot be explained by gas-phase chemistry
only and its surface hydrogenation formation routes at low temperatures (O, O2,
O3 channels) are still unclear and most likely incomplete. In a previous paper
we discussed an unexpected zeroth-order H2O production behavior in O2 ice
hydrogenation experiments compared to the first-order H2CO and CH3OH production
behavior found in former studies on hydrogenation of CO ice. In this paper we
experimentally investigate in detail how the structure of O2 ice leads to this
rare behavior in reaction order and production yield. In our experiments H
atoms are added to a thick O2 ice under fully controlled conditions, while the
changes are followed by means of reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy
(RAIRS). The H-atom penetration mechanism is systematically studied by varying
the temperature, thickness and structure of the O2 ice. We conclude that the
competition between reaction and diffusion of the H atoms into the O2 ice
explains the unexpected H2O and H2O2 formation behavior. In addition, we show
that the proposed O2 hydrogenation scheme is incomplete, suggesting that
additional surface reactions should be considered. Indeed, the detection of
newly formed O3 in the ice upon H-atom exposure proves that the O2 channel is
not an isolated route. Furthermore, the addition of H2 molecules is found not
to have a measurable effect on the O2 reaction channel.

not complete, and that the reaction channels are probably more interconnected
than previously thought. In this paper we aim to derive the full reaction
scheme for O2 surface hydrogenation and to constrain the rates of the
individual reactions. This is achieved through simultaneous H-atom and O2
deposition under ultra-high vacuum conditions for astronomically relevant
temperatures. Different H/O2 ratios are used to trace different stages in the
hydrogenation network. The chemical changes in the forming ice are followed by
means of reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS). New reaction

justified for an investigation of buoyancy instabilities with the electron

collisionless dispersion relation considerably differs from that obtained in
the MHD framework and is similar to the Schwarzschild's criterion. This
difference is connected with simplified assumptions used in the MHD analysis of
buoyancy instabilities and with the role of the longitudinal electric field
perturbation which is not captured by the ideal MHD equations. The results

its surroundings. Such emission correlates quite well with the position of
dense and massive molecular clouds and thus it is often interpreted as the
result of hadronic cosmic ray interactions in the dense gas. Constraints on the
cosmic ray diffusion coefficient in the region can be obtained, under the
assumption that the cosmic rays responsible for the gamma ray emission have
been accelerated in the past at the supernova remnant shock, and subsequently
escaped in the surrounding medium. In this scenario, gamma ray observations can
be explained only if the diffusion coefficient in the region surrounding the
supernova remnant is significantly suppressed with respect to the average
galactic one.

supermassive black holes and their host galaxies, as a function of the
accretion radiative efficiency, dark matter content, and cosmological infall of
gas. In particular, the radiation feedback is computed by using the
self-regulated Bondi accretion. The models are characterized by strong
oscillations when the galaxy is in the AGN state with a high accretion
luminosity. We found that these one-zone models are able to reproduce two
important phases of galaxy evolution, namely an obscured-cold phase when the
bulk of star formation and black hole accretion occur, and the following
quiescent hot phase in which accretion remains highly sub-Eddington. A
Compton-thick phase is also found in almost all models, associated with the
cold phase. An exploration of the parameter space reveals that the closest
agreement with the present-day Magorrian relation is obtained, independently of
the dark matter halo mass, for galaxies with a low-mass seed black hole, and
the accretion radiative efficiency ~0.1.

a_{\mu}^{LBL;quarkloop} = (107 \pm 2 \pm 46) x 10^{-11}, is significantly
larger due to dressing effects in the quark propagator and the quark-photon

vertex-corrected electronic charge transport for multilayered devices composed
of semi-infinite metallic lead layers coupled through a strongly correlated
material barrier region. The barrier region can be tuned from a metal to a Mott
insulator through adjusting the interaction strength and the particle filling.
We use the Falicov-Kimball model to describe the barrier region because an
exact expression for the vertex corrections is known, allowing us to determine
their effect on transport. The dc conductivity is calculated and we find the
effects of the vertex corrections are relatively small, manifesting themselves
in a small reduction in the resistance-area product. This reduction saturates
in absolute magnitude as the barrier layer becomes thick, as expected due to
the vanishing nature of the vertex corrections in bulk. The vertex corrections
have a larger relative effect on the resistance-area product for more metallic
and thinner devices.

axisymmetric simulations for the collapse of a rotating high-entropy stellar
core to a black hole and an accretion disk. The simulations are performed
taking into account the relevant microphysics. We adopt as initial condition a
spherical core with constant electron fraction ($Y_e = 0.5$) and entropy per
baryon $s$ = 8 $k_B$, and angular velocity is superimposed. In the early phase,
the core collapses in a homologous manner. Then, it experiences a weak bounce
due to the gas pressure of free nucleons. Because the bounce is weak, the core
collapses eventually to a black hole. Subsequent evolution depends on initial
angular velocity. When the rotation is not fast, a geometrically thin (but
optically thick) accretion disk is formed, and shock waves are formed in the
inner part of the disk. For the moderately rotating case, the thin accretion
disk expands eventually to be a geometrically thick torus after sufficient
accumulation of the thermal energy generated at the shocks. Furthermore,
convection occurs inside the torus. Neutrino luminosities vary violently with
time because of the convective motion. For the rapidly rotating case, by
contrast, a geometrically thick torus is formed soon after the black hole
formation, and convective activity is weak due to the presence of epicyclic
mode.
