We do this first: for diffusively scaled random walks on $\mathbf Z^d$ $(d \ge

belonging to the non-normal domain of attraction of the normal law. This result
can be applied to random walks with tail behavior analogous to that of the

We obtain exact results incorporating all higher order quantum corrections in
the limit when only one of the charges, representing momentum along an internal
direction, approaches infinity keeping all other charges fixed at arbitrary
finite values. In this limit, we find that the microscopic index is controlled
by certain anomaly coefficients whereas the macroscopic index is controlled by
the coefficients of certain Chern-Simons terms in the effective action. The
equality between the macroscopic and the microscopic index then follows as a
consequence of anomaly inflow. In contrast, the absolute degeneracy does not
have any such simple expression in terms of the anomaly coefficients or
coefficients of Chern-Simons terms. We apply our analysis to several examples
of spinning black holes in five dimensions and non-spinning black holes in four

induce warping in the disc and produce secular changes in the stellar spin
direction, so that the spin axis may not always be perpendicular to the disc.
This may help explain the recently observed spin-orbit misalignment in a number
of exoplanetary systems. We study the dynamics of warped protoplanetary discs
under the combined effects of magnetic warping/precession torques and internal
stresses in the disc, including viscous damping of warps and propagation of
bending waves. We show that when the outer disc axis is misaligned with the
stellar spin axis, the disc evolves towards a warped steady-state on a
timescale that depends on the disc viscosity or the bending wave propagation
speed, but in all cases is much shorter than the timescale for the spin
evolution (of order of a million years). Moreover, for the most likely physical
parameters characterizing magnetic protostars, circumstellar discs and their
interactions, the steady-state disc has a rather small warp, such that the
whole disc lies approximately in a single plane determined by the outer disc
boundary conditions, although more extreme parameters may give rise to larger
disc warps. In agreement with our recent analysis (Lai et al. 2010) based on
flat discs, we find that the back-reaction magnetic torques of the slightly
warped disc on the star can either align the stellar spin axis with the disc

is even more effective at producing sparsity. Our results demonstrate that
FOBOS uses subgradient approximations to the L1 penalty from previous rounds,
leading to less sparsity than RDA, which handles the cumulative penalty in
closed form. The FTRL-Proximal algorithm can be seen as a hybrid of these two,
and outperforms both on a large, real-world dataset.

support a more general type of composite objective and we analyze implicit

which are essential for phytoplankton, leads to complex dynamic behavior and a
wide array of coherent patterns. The building blocks of this array can be
considered to be deep chlorophyll maxima, or DCMs, which are structures
localized in a finite depth interior to the water column. From an ecological
point of view, DCMs are evocative of a balance between the inflow of light from
the water surface and of nutrients from the sediment. From a (linear)
bifurcational point of view, they appear through a transcritical bifurcation in
which the trivial, no-plankton steady state is destabilized. This article is
devoted to the analytic investigation of the weakly nonlinear dynamics of these
DCM patterns, and it has two overarching themes. The first of these concerns
the fate of the destabilizing stationary DCM mode beyond the center manifold
regime. Exploiting the natural singularly perturbed nature of the model, we
derive an explicit reduced model of asymptotically high dimension which fully
captures these dynamics. Our subsequent and fully detailed study of this model
- which involves a subtle asymptotic analysis necessarily transgressing the
boundaries of a local center manifold reduction - establishes that a stable DCM
pattern indeed appears from a transcritical bifurcation. However, we also
deduce that asymptotically close to the original destabilization, the DCM
looses its stability in a secondary bifurcation of Hopf type. This is in
agreement with indications from numerical simulations available in the
literature. Employing the same methods, we also identify a much larger DCM
pattern. The development of the method underpinning this work - which, we
expect, shall prove useful for a larger class of models - forms the second
theme of this article.

constraints, is analyzed in a multiuser scenario. In particular, the effective
capacity region of fading multiple access channels (MAC) in the presence of
quality of service (QoS) constraints is studied. Perfect channel side
information (CSI) is assumed to be available at both the transmitters and the
receiver. It is initially assumed the transmitters send the information at a
fixed power level and hence do not employ power control policies. Under this
assumption, the performance achieved by superposition coding with successive
decoding techniques is investigated. It is shown that varying the decoding
order with respect to the channel states can significantly increase the
achievable throughput region. In the two-user case, the optimal decoding
strategy is determined for the scenario in which the users have the same QoS
constraints. The performance of orthogonal transmission strategies is also
analyzed. It is shown that for certain QoS constraints, time-division
multiple-access (TDMA) can achieve better performance than superposition coding
if fixed successive decoding order is used at the receiver side.
  In the subsequent analysis, power control policies are incorporated into the
transmission strategies. The optimal power allocation policies for any fixed
decoding order over all channel states are identified. For a given variable
decoding order strategy, the conditions that the optimal power control policies
must satisfy are determined, and an algorithm that can be used to compute these
optimal policies is provided.

dwarfs. Illustrative model atmospheres and spectral energy distributions are
computed, which show that Ly-alpha broadening by atoms and molecules has a
significant effect on the white dwarf atmosphere models. The inclusion of this
collision-induced opacity significantly reddens spectral energy distributions
and affects the broadband colour indices for model atmospheres with Teff<5000
K. These results confirm those previously obtained by Kowalski & Saumon (2006).
Our study points out the need for reliable evaluations of H3 potential energy
surfaces covering a large region of nuclear configurations, in order to obtain
a better description of H-H2 collisions and a more accurate evaluation of their
influence on the spectrum of cool white dwarfs.

indicating that the mid-infrared water lines trace similar radii. The
rotational temperatures of the water are 540 and 600K in the two disks,

with low-excitation line fluxes being over-predicted by 2-dimensional disk LTE

a best estimate for AS 205N is ortho/para = 4.5 +/- 1.0, apparently ruling out

mechanisms for active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity? To answer this
longstanding question, we analyze 140 XMM-selected AGN host galaxies and a
matched control sample of 1264 inactive galaxies over z~0.3-1.0 and
log(M_*/M_sun)<11.7 with high-resolution HST/ACS imaging from the COSMOS field.
The visual analysis of their morphologies by 10 independent human classifiers
yields a measure of the fraction of distorted morphologies in the AGN and
control samples, i.e. quantifying the signature of recent mergers which might
potentially be responsible for fueling/triggering the AGN. We find that (1) the
vast majority (>85%) of the AGN host galaxies do not show strong distortions,
and (2) there is no significant difference in the distortion fractions between
active and inactive galaxies. Our findings provide the best direct evidence
that, since z~1, the bulk of black hole accretion has not been triggered by
major galaxy mergers, therefore arguing that the alternative mechanisms, i.e.,
secular processes and minor interactions, are the leading triggers for the
episodes of major black hole growth. We also exclude an alternative
interpretation of our results: a significant time lag between merging and the
observability of the AGN phase could wash out the most significant merging
signatures, explaining the lack of enhancement of strong distortions on the AGN
hosts. We show that this alternative scenario is unlikely due to: (1) recent
major mergers being ruled out for the majority of sources due to the high
fraction of disk-hosted AGN, (2) the lack of a significant X-ray signal in
merging inactive galaxies as a signature of a potential buried AGN, and (3) the
low levels of soft X-ray obscuration for AGN hosted by interacting galaxies, in
contrast to model predictions.

to achieve the first systematic SBF calibration for the ACS/F814W bandpass.
Because of its much higher throughput, F814W is more efficient for SBF studies
of distant galaxies than the ACS/F850LP bandpass that has been used to study
nearby systems. Over the color range spanned by the sample galaxies,
1.06<g-I<1.32 (AB mag), the dependence of SBF magnitude mbar_I on g-I is linear
to a good approximation, with slope $\sim2$. When the F850LP SBF distance
measurements from the ACS Fornax Cluster Survey are used to derive absolute
Mbar_I magnitudes, the dependence on g-I becomes extremely tight, with a slope
of $1.8\pm0.2$ and scatter of 0.03 mag. The small observed scatter indicates
both that the estimated random errors are correct, and that the intrinsic
deviations from the SBF-color relation are strongly correlated between the
F814W and F850LP bandpasses, as expected. The agreement with predictions from
stellar population models is good, both in slope and zero point, indicating
that our mean Fornax distance of 20 Mpc is accurate. The models predict
curvature in the relation beyond the color limits of our sample; thus, the
linear calibration should not be extrapolated naively. In the Appendices, we
reconsider the Tonry ground-based and Jensen NICMOS SBF distance catalogues; we
provide a correction formula to ameliorate the small apparent bias in the
former, and the offset needed to make the latter consistent with other SBF
studies. We also tabulate two new SBF distances to galaxies observed in the ACS

Prsa et al. 2010) that we have determined is comprised of a low-mass,
thermally-bloated, hot white dwarf orbiting an A star of about 2.3 solar
masses. In this work we designate the object, KIC 10657664, simply as KHWD3. We
use the transit depth of ~0.66%, the eclipse depth of ~1.9%, and regular smooth
periodic variations at the orbital frequency and twice the orbital frequency to
analyze the system parameters. The smooth periodic variations are identified
with the classical ellipsoidal light variation and illumination effects, and
the newly utilized Doppler boosting effect. Given the measured values of R/a
and inclination angle of the binary, both the ELV and DB effects are mostly
sensitive to the mass ratio, q = M_2/M_1, of the binary. The two effects yield
values of q which are somewhat inconsistent - presumably due to unidentified
systematic effects - but which nonetheless provide a quite useful set of
possibilities for the mass of the white dwarf (either 0.18 +/- 0.03 M_Sun or
0.37 +/- 0.08 M_Sun). All of the other system parameters are determined fairly
robustly. In particular, we show that the white dwarf has a radius of 0.15 +/-
0.01 R_Sun which is extremely bloated over the radius it would have as a fully
degenerate object, and an effective temperature T_eff = 14,100 +/- 350 K.
Binary evolution scenarios and models for this system are discussed. We suggest
that the progenitor binary was comprised of a primary of mass ~2.2 M_Sun (the
progenitor of the current hot white dwarf) and a secondary of mass ~1.4 M_Sun
(the progenitor of the current A star in the system). We compare this new
system with three other white dwarfs in binaries that likely were formed via
stable Roche-lobe overflow (KOI-74, KOI-81, and Regulus).

the determination of the local, spatially resolved star formation law. Using
four star formation rate (SFR) tracers (H\alpha with azimuthally averaged
extinction correction, mid-infrared 24 micron, combined H\alpha and
mid-infrared 24 micron, and combined far-ultraviolet and mid-infrared 24
micron), several fitting procedures, and different sampling strategies we probe
the relation between SFR and molecular gas at various spatial resolutions and
surface densities within the central 6.5 kpc in the disk of NGC4254. We find
that in the high surface brightness regions of NGC4254 the form of the
molecular gas star formation law is robustly determined and approximately
linear and independent of the assumed fraction of diffuse emission and the SFR
tracer employed. When the low surface brightness regions are included, the
slope of the star formation law depends primarily on the assumed fraction of
diffuse emission. In such case, results range from linear when the fraction of
diffuse emission in the SFR tracer is ~30% or less (or when diffuse emission is
removed in both the star formation and the molecular gas tracer), to
super-linear when the diffuse fraction is ~50% and above. We find that the
tightness of the correlation between gas and star formation varies with the
choice of star formation tracer. The 24 micron SFR tracer by itself shows the
tightest correlation with the molecular gas surface density, whereas the
H\alpha corrected for extinction using an azimuthally-averaged correction shows
the highest dispersion. We find that for R<0.5R_25 the local star formation
efficiency is constant and similar to that observed in other large spirals,
with a molecular gas depletion time ~2 Gyr.

of these winds with the planetary magnetic field generates drag on the winds

magnitude of ohmic dissipation in representative, three-dimensional atmospheric
circulation models of the hot Jupiter HD 209458b. We find that ohmic
dissipation can reach or exceed 1% of the stellar insolation power in the
deepest atmospheric layers, in models with and without dragged winds. Such
power, dissipated in the deep atmosphere, appears sufficient to slow down
planetary contraction and explain the typically inflated radii of hot Jupiters.
This atmospheric scenario does not require a top insulating layer or radial
currents that penetrate deep in the planetary interior. Circulation in the
deepest atmospheric layers may actually be driven by spatially non-uniform
ohmic dissipation. A consistent treatment of magnetic drag and ohmic
dissipation is required to further elucidate the consequences of magnetic
effects for the atmospheres and the contracting interiors of hot Jupiters.

expected parameter errors for future surveys under Gaussian assumptions. In
this article, we present a frame- work that can be used to design experiments
such that it maximises the chance of finding a deviation from the standard
model. Using a simple illustrative example, discussed in the appendix, we show
that the optimal experimental configuration can depend dramatically on the
optimisation approach chosen. We also show some simple cosmology calculations,
where we study Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation and Supernove surveys. In doing
so, we also show how external data, such as the positions of the CMB peaks
measured by WMAP, and theory priors can be included in the analysis. In the
cosmological cases that we have studied (DETF Stage III), we find that the
three optimisation approaches yield similar results, which is reassuring and
indicates that the choice of optimal experiment is fairly robust at this level.
However, this may not be the case as we move to more ambitious future surveys.

the d-wave superconductivity order parameter. To illustrate this point we study

Telescope for 12 nearby spiral galaxies reveals low velocity dispersions in the
molecular component of the interstellar medium. The three lowest luminosity
galaxies show a relatively flat velocity dispersion as a function of radius
while the remaining nine galaxies show a central peak with a radial fall-off
within 0.2-0.4 r(25). Correcting for the average contribution due to the
internal velocitydispersions of a population of giant molecular clouds, the
average cloud-cloud velocity dispersion across the galactic disks is 6.1 +/-
1.0 km/s (standard deviation 2.9 km/s), in reasonable agreement with previous
measurements for the Galaxy andM33. The cloud-cloud velocity dispersion derived
from the CO data is on average two times smaller than the HI velocity
dispersion measured in the same galaxies. The low cloud-cloudvelocity
dispersion implies that the molecular gas is the critical component determining
the stability of the galactic disk against gravitational collapse, especially
in those regions of the disk which are H2 dominated. The cloud-cloud velocity
dispersion shows a significant positivecorrelation with both the far-infrared
luminosity, which traces the star formation activity, and the K-band absolute
magnitude, which traces the total stellar mass. For three galaxies in the Virgo
cluster, smoothing the data to a resolution of 4.5 kpc (to match the typical
resolution of high redshift CO observations) increases the measured velocity
dispersion by roughly a factor of two, comparable to the dispersion measured
recently in a normal galaxy at z=1. This comparison suggests that the mass and
star formation rate surface densities may be similar in galaxies from z=0-1 and
that the high star formation rates seen at z=1 may be partly due to the
presence of physically larger molecular gas disks.

long-slit absorption line spectra reaching out to ~25 kpc in the halo of NGC
3311. Results: We find a very steep increase in the velocity dispersion profile
from a central sigma_0=150 km/s to sigma_out ~450 km/s at R ~ 12 kpc. Farther
out, to ~25 kpc, sigma appears to be constant at this value, which is ~60% of
the velocity dispersion of the Hydra I galaxies. With its dynamically hot halo
kinematics, NGC 3311 is unlike other normal early-type galaxies. Conclusions:
These results and the large amount of dark matter inferred from X-rays around
NGC 3311 suggest that the stellar halo of this galaxy is dominated by the
central intracluster stars of the cluster, and that the transition from
predominantly galaxy-bound stars to cluster stars occurs in the radial range 4

the ISM magnetic field around DeHt 5, derive an electron density in the inner
tail of n_e = 3.6 +/- 1.8 cm^-3. Assuming the material is fully ionized, we
estimate a total mass in the inner tail of 0.68 +/- 0.33 solar masses, and
predict that 0.49 +/- 0.33 solar masses was added during the PN-ISM

is less conspicuous than the inner tail, and may be the signature of the

progenitor and the ISM. The results for the inner and outer tails are
consistent with hydrodynamic simulations, and may have implications for the PN
missing-mass problem as well as for models which describe the impact of the

as a superposition of dipole and octupole moments with respective strengths of
the polar magnetic fields of 1.2 kG and 1.6 kG (Donati et al. 2008). We adopt
the measured properties of BP Tau and model the disc accretion onto the star.
We observed in simulations that the disc is disrupted by the dipole component
and matter flows towards the star in two funnel streams which form two
accretion spots below the dipole magnetic poles. The octupolar component
becomes dynamically important very close to the star and it redirects the
matter flow to higher latitudes. The spots are meridionally elongated and are
located at higher latitudes, compared with the pure dipole case, where
crescent-shaped, latitudinally elongated spots form at lower latitudes. The
position and shape of the spots are in good agreement with observations. The
disk-magnetosphere interaction leads to the inflation of the field lines and to
the formation of magnetic towers above and below the disk. The magnetic field
of BP Tau is close to the potential only near the star, inside the
magnetospheric surface, where magnetic stress dominates over the matter stress.
A series of simulation runs were performed for different accretion rates. They
show that an accretion rate is lower than obtained in many observations, unless
the disc is truncated close to the star. The torque acting on the star is about
an order of magnitude lower than that which is required for the rotational
equilibrium. We suggest that a star could lose most of its angular momentum at
earlier stages of its evolution.

distribution is inhomogeneous and, therefore, the method of temperature
measuring based on the SZ effect should be more relevant than that based on an

  Our calculations of intensity maps of the SZ effect include relativistic
corrections considered within the framework of the Wright formalism and utilize
a cosmological numerical simulation of a merging galaxy cluster evolved with
its baryon physics.
  We found that the gas temperature in merging clusters can be measured by
means of the ratio of the SZ intensity at a low frequency (128 GHz) to that at
a high frequency (369 GHz). This SZ intensity ratio permits us to reveal
prominent features of the temperature structure caused by violent merger shock
waves. Therefore, measurements of the ratio of the SZ intensities are a
promising tool for measuring gas temperature in merging galaxy clusters.

determine the effect of the process on an arbitrary state. We introduce a new

the need to invoke the Glauber-Sudarshan representation for states; hence it
dramatically simplifies the task of process identification and removes a

extensions of the method to multi-mode and non-trace-preserving processes. We
illustrate our formalism with several examples, in which we derive analytic

renormalization factor, in contrast to results by the conventional Gutzwiller
approximation. We demonstrate it by showing that transition matrix elements of
number operators between assumed excited states and between an assumed ground
state and excited states are renormalized differently than diagonal matrix
elements. Deviation from such simple renormalization with a factor is also
discussed. In addition, as related calculation, we correct an error in
treatment of renormalization of charge interaction in the literature. Namely,
terms from the second order of the transition matrix elements are strongly
suppressed. Since all these results do not depend on the signs of impurity
potential or charge interaction parameter, they are valid both in attractive
and repulsive cases.

dwarf binary systems with periods ranging from minutes to hours. As the orbit
of the system decays via gravitational radiation, the orbital frequency
increases and sweeps through a series of resonances with the g-modes of the
white dwarf. At each resonance, the tidal force excites the g-mode to a
relatively large amplitude, transferring the orbital energy to the stellar
oscillation. We calculate the eigenfrequencies of g-modes and their coupling
coefficients with the tidal field for realistic non-rotating white dwarf
models. Using these mode properties, we numerically compute the excited mode
amplitude in the linear approximation as the orbit passes though the resonance,
including the backreaction of the mode on the orbit. We also derive analytical
estimates for the mode amplitude and the duration of the resonance, which
accurately reproduce our numerical results for most binary parameters. We find
that the g-modes can be excited to a dimensionless (mass-weighted) amplitude up
to 0.1, with the mode energy approaching $10^{-3}$ of the gravitational binding
energy of the star. This suggests that thousands of years prior to the binary
merger, the white dwarf may be heated up significantly by tidal interactions.
However, more study is needed since the physical amplitudes of the excited
oscillation modes become highly nonlinear in the outer layer of the star, which
can reduce the mode amplitude attained by tidal excitation.

TeV) is revealed by radio and X-ray observations of shocks in young supernova
remnants (SNRs). The diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) mechanism is usually
invoked to explain this acceleration, but the way in which electrons are
initially energized or 'injected' into this acceleration process starting from
thermal energies is an unresolved problem. In this paper we study the initial
acceleration of electrons in non-relativistic shocks from first principles,
using two- and three-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) plasma simulations. We
systematically explore the space of shock parameters (the Alfv\'enic Mach
number, M_A, the shock velocity, v_{sh}, the angle between the upstream
magnetic field and the shock normal, theta_{Bn}, and the ion to electron mass
ratio, m_i/m_e). We find that significant non-thermal acceleration occurs due
to the growth of oblique whistler waves in the foot of quasi-perpendicular
shocks. The obtained electron energy distributions show power law tails with
spectral indices up to alpha ~ 3-4. The maximum energies of the accelerated
particles are consistent with the electron Larmor radii being comparable to
that of the ions, indicating potential injection into the subsequent DSA
process. This injection mechanism, however, requires the shock waves to have
fairly low Alf\'enic Mach numbers, M_A <~ 20, which is consistent with the
theoretical conditions for the growth of whistler waves in the shock foot (M_A
<~ (m_i/m_e)^{1/2}). Thus, if the whistler mechanism is the only robust
electron injection process at work in SNR shocks, then SNRs that display
non-thermal emission must have significantly amplified upstream magnetic
fields. Such field amplification is likely achieved by the escaping cosmic
rays, so electron and proton acceleration in SNR shocks must be interconnected.

we describe in detail a method for implementation of a realistic equation of

dimensional (2D) simulation of spherical stellar core collapse. Until the
convective activities set in, our results approximately agree, or at least are
consistent, with those in the previous so-called state-of-the-art simulations.
In particular, the radial profiles of thermodynamical quantities and the time
evolution of the neutrino luminosities agree quantitatively. The convection is
driven by negative gradients of the entropy per baryon and the electron
fraction as in the previous 2D Newtonian simulations. We clarify which gradient
is more responsible for the convection. Gravitational waves from the convection
are also calculated. We find that the characteristic frequencies of the
gravitational-wave spectra are distributed for higher frequencies than those in
Newtonian simulations due to the general relativistic effects.

itself is a correlate of word success at historical time scales. Our analysis
of changes in word frequencies over time reveals that the relative sizes of
word niches are far more important than word frequencies in the dynamics of the
entire vocabulary at shorter time scales, as the language adapts to new
concepts and social groupings. We also distinguish endogenous versus exogenous
factors as additional contributors to the fates of words, and demonstrate the

Rayleigh-Taylor fingers interact with one another, mixing proceeds to a greater
degree in 3D than in 2D, reducing the local Atwood number and slowing the
growth rate of the instability in 3D relative to 2D. By the time mixing has
stopped, the width of the mixed region is similar in 2D and 3D simulations

imply that 2D simulations of light curves and nucleosynthesis in supernovae

spherically symmetric explosion in far less computational time than required by
a full 3D simulation. However, capturing large departures from spherical
symmetry requires a significantly perturbed explosion. Large scale asymmetries
cannot develop through an inverse cascade of merging Rayleigh-Taylor
structures; they must arise from asymmetries in the initial explosion.

narrower as the time bin gets smaller, and can be fit with a Planck function as
the time bin becomes small enough. In general, we speculate that
phenomenologically there may be three elemental spectral components : (I) a
Band-function component (e.g. in GRB 080916C) that extends in a wide energy
range and does not narrow with reducing time bins, which may be of the
non-thermal origin; (II) a quasi-thermal component (e.g. in GRB 090902B) with
the spectra progressively narrowing with reducing time bins; and (III) another
non-thermal power law component extending to high energies. The spectra of

networks. However, the precoding efficiency can be significantly degraded by

This paper addresses such an issue by proposing a systematic method of
designing precoders for the two-user multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO)
interference channels based on finite-rate CSI feedback from receivers to their
interferers, called cooperative feedback. Specifically, each precoder is
decomposed into inner and outer precoders for nulling interference and
improving the data link array gain, respectively. The inner precoders are
further designed to suppress residual interference resulting from finite-rate
cooperative feedback. To regulate residual interference due to precoder
quantization, additional scalar cooperative feedback signals are designed to
control transmitters' power using different criteria including applying
interference margins, maximizing sum throughput, and minimizing outage
probability. Simulation shows that such additional feedback effectively
alleviates performance degradation due to quantized precoder feedback.

the Weyl orbit $W(\rho)$ of its Weyl vector $\rho$. A remarkable fact for
Affine Lie algebras is that the number of elements of $W(\rho)$ is finite at
each and every depth level though totally it has infinite number of elements.
This allows us to look at $W(\rho)$ as a manifold graded by depths of its
elements and hence a new kind of Poincare Polynomial is defined. We give these
polynomials for all Affine Kac-Moody Lie algebras, non-twisted or twisted. The
remarkable fact is however that, on the contrary to the ones which are
classically defined,these new kind of Poincare polynomials have modular
properties, namely they all are expressed in the form of eta-quotients. When
one recalls Weyl-Kac character formula for irreducible characters, it is
natural to think that this modularity properties could be directly related with
Kac-Peterson theorem which says affine characters have modular properties.
Another point to emphasize is the relation between these modular Poincare
Polynomials and the Permutation Weights which we previously introduced for
Finite and also Affine Lie algebras. By the aid of permutation weights, we have
shown that Weyl orbits of an Affine Lie algebra are decomposed in the form of
direct sum of Weyl orbits of its horizontal Lie algebra and this new kind of

background in the field is the scattered starlight from the interstellar dust
grains. We also find strong evidence of additional emission in the FUV band
which is absent in the NUV band. This is most likely due to Lyman band emission
from molecular hydrogen in a ridge of dust running through the field and to
line emissions from species such as C IV (1550 A) and Si II (1533 A) in the
rest of the field. A strong correlation exists between the FUV/NUV ratio and
the FUV intensity in the excess emission regions in the FUV band irrespective
of the optical depth of the region. The optical depth increases more rapidly in
the UV than the IR and we find that the UV/IR ratio drops off exponentially

spectral properties of the outburst using RXTE data. Aims. Our goal is to study
the timing and spectral properties of GX 339-4 using its recent outburst data
and extract information about the nature of the accretion flow. Methods. We use
RXTE archival data of the recent GX 339-4 outburst and analyze them with the
NASA HEAsoft package, version 6.8. We then compare the observed quasi-periodic
oscillation (QPO) frequencies with those from existing shock oscillation model
and obtain the nature of evolution of the shock locations during the outburst.
Results. We found that the QPO frequencies are monotonically increasing from
0.102 Hz to 5.69 Hz within a period of ~ 26 days. We explain this evolution
with the propagating oscillatory shock (POS) solution and find the variation of
the initial and final shock locations and strengths. The model fits also give
the velocity of the propagating shock wave, which is responsible for the
generation of QPOs and their evolutions, at ~ 10 m/s. We observe from the
spectra that up to 2010 April 10, the object was in a hard state. After that,
it went to the hard-intermediate state. On April 18, it had a state transition
and went to the soft-intermediate state. On May 15, another state transition
was observed and the source moved to the soft state. Conclusions. As in the
previously fitted outburst sources, this source also showed the tendency of a
rapidly increasing QPO frequency ($\nu_{QPO}$) in a viscous time scale, which
can be modeled quite accurately. In this case, the shock seems to have
disappeared at about ~ 172 Schwarzschild radii, unlike in the 2005 outburst of
GRO J1655-40, where the shock disappeared behind the horizon.

number is challenging due to the stiff nonlinear collision term. A class of
asymptotic preserving schemes was introduced in [6] to handle this kind of
problems. The idea is to penalize the stiff collision term by a BGK type
operator. This method, however, encounters its own difficulty when applied to
the quantum Boltzmann equation. To define the quantum Maxwellian (Bose-Einstein
or Fermi- Dirac distribution) at each time step and every mesh point, one has
to invert a nonlinear equation that connects the macroscopic quantity fugacity
with density and internal energy. Setting a good initial guess for the
iterative method is troublesome in most cases because of the complexity of the
quantum functions (Bose-Einstein or Fermi-Dirac function). In this paper, we
propose to penalize the quantum collision term by a 'classical' BGK operator
instead of the quantum one. This is based on the observation that the classical
Maxwellian, with the temperature replaced by the internal energy, has the same
first five moments as the quantum Maxwellian. The scheme so designed avoids the
aforementioned difficulty, and one can show that the density distribution is
still driven toward the quantum equilibrium. Numerical results are present to
illustrate the efficiency of the new scheme in both the hydrodynamic and
kinetic regimes. We also develop a spectral method for the quantum collision

perturbed energy growth) in a wedge flow boundary layer. These three
dimensional perturbations are governed by a system of linearized boundary layer
equations around the Falkner-Skan base flow. Based on an asymptotic analysis of
this system near the free stream and the leading edge singularity, we show that
for acute wedge semi-angle, all solutions converge after a streamwise transient
to a single streamwise-growing solution of the linearized equations, whose
initial condition near the leading edge is given by an eigenvalue problem first
formulated in this context by Tumin (2001). Such a solution may be regarded as
a streamwise evolving most unstable streaky mode, in analogy with the usual
eigenmodes in strictly parallel flows, and shows an approximate
self-similarity, which was partially known and is completed in this paper. An
important consequence of this result is that the optimization procedure based
on the adjoint equations heretofore used to define optimal streaks is not
necessary. Instead, a simple low-dimensional optimization process is proposed
and used to obtain optimal streaks. Comparison with previous results by Tumin
and Ashpis (2003) shows an excellent agreement. The unstable streaky mode
exhibits transient growth if the wedge semi-angle is smaller than a critical
value that is slightly larger than $\pi/6$, and decays otherwise. Thus the
cases of right and obtuse wedge semi-angles exhibit less practical interest,
but they show a qualitatively different behavior, which is briefly described to
complete the analysis.

microphysical processes is one of long standing problems in numerical
relativity. One of main difficulties in implementation of weak interactions in
the general relativistic framework lies on the fact that the characteristic
timescale of weak interaction processes (the WP timescale) in hot dense matters
is much shorter than the dynamical timescale. Numerically this means that stiff
source terms appears in the equations so that an implicit scheme is in general
necessary to stably solve the relevant equations. Otherwise a very short
timestep will be required to solve them explicitly. Furthermore, in the
relativistic framework, the Lorentz factor is coupled with the rest mass
density and the energy density. The specific enthalpy is also coupled with the
momentum. Due to these couplings, it is very complicated to recover the
primitive variables and the Lorentz factor from conserved quantities. At the
current status, no implicit procedure have been proposed except for the case of
the spherical symmetry. Therefore, an approximate, explicit procedure is
developed in the fully general relativistic framework in this paper as an first
implementation of the microphysics toward a more realistic sophisticated model.
The procedure is based on the so-called neutrino leakage schemes which is based
on the property that the characteristic timescale in which neutrinos leak out
of the system (the leakage timescale) is much longer than the WP timescale. In
this paper, I present a detailed neutrino leakage scheme and a simple and
stable method for solving the equations explicitly in the fully general
relativistic framework. I also perform a test simulation to check the validity
of the present method, showing that it works fairly well.

profiting from one's own widening CDS spreads, i.e. increased risk of default,
in practice. The unified picture of CVA and liquidity introduced by Morini &
Prampolini 2010 has contributed to understanding this. However, there are two
significant omissions for practical implementation that come from the same
source, i.e. positions not booked in usual position-keeping systems. The first
omission is firm-level positions that change value upon firm default. An
example is Goodwill which is a line item on balance sheets and typically
written down to zero on default. Another example would be firm Equity. The
second omission relates to collateralized positions. When these positions are
out of the money in future, which has a positive probability, they will require
funding that cannot be secured using the position itself. These contingent
future funding positions are usually not booked in any position-keeping system.
We show here how to include these two types of positions and thus help to
complete the unified picture of CVA and liquidity.
  For a particular large complex financial institution that profited $2.5B from
spread widening we show that including Goodwill would have resulted in a $4B
loss under conservative assumptions. Whilst we cannot make a similar assessment
for its collateralized derivative portfolio we calculate both the funding costs
and the CVA from own default for a range of swaps and find that CVA was a
positive contribution in the examples.

theoretical progress allows us to analyse data of inelastic neutron scattering
(INS) and of magnetic susceptibility to determine the four magnetic couplings
J1=-2.3meV, J2=1.2meV, J3=2.9meV and J4=-0.3meV. These couplings determine
IPA-CuCl3 as system of coupled asymmetric S=1/2 Heisenberg ladders
quantitatively. The magnetic field dependence of the lowest modes in the
condensed phase as well as the temperature dependence of the gap without
magnetic field corroborate this microscopic model.

spectral features as a function of mass and environment for two sample of
early-type galaxies up to z=1 extracted from the zCOSMOS spectroscopic survey.
The first sample (""red galaxies"") is defined with a photometric classification,
while the second (""ETGs"") by combining morphological, photometric, and
spectroscopic properties to obtain a more reliable sample. We find that the
color distribution of red galaxies is not strongly dependent on environment for
all mass bins, with galaxies in overdense regions redder than galaxies in
underdense regions with a difference of 0.027\pm0.008 mag. The dependence on
mass is far more significant, with average colors of massive galaxies redder by
0.093\pm0.007 mag than low-mass galaxies throughout the entire redshift range.
We study the color-mass relation, finding a mean slope 0.12\pm0.005, while the
color-environment relation is flatter, with a slope always smaller than 0.04.
The spectral analysis that we perform on our ETGs sample is in good agreement
with our photometric results: we find for D4000 a dependence on mass between
high and low-mass galaxies, and a much weaker dependence on environment
(respectively a difference of of 0.11\pm0.02 and of 0.05\pm0.02); for the
equivalent width of H{\delta}we measure a difference of 0.28\pm0.08 {\AA}across
the same mass range and no significant dependence on environment.By analyzing
the lookback time of early-type galaxies, we support the possibility of a
downsizing scenario, in which massive galaxies with a stronger D4000 and an
almost constant equivalent width of $H\delta$ formed their mass at higher
redshift than lower mass ones. We also conclude that the main driver of galaxy
evolution is the galaxy mass, the environment playing a subdominant role.

Luminous Infrared Galaxies (LIRGs), which dominate high star formation rate
(SFR) density at z~1, in the sample identified by cross-correlating with the
Spitzer/MIPS 24um source catalog. We perform two-dimensional light profile
fitting of the z~1 galaxies in the Ks-band (rest-frame J-band) with a single
component Sersic model. We find that at z~1, ~90% of LIRGs have low Sersic
indices (n<2.5, similar to disk-like galaxies) in the Ks-band, and those
disk-like LIRGs consist of ~60% of the whole disk-like sample above M_{s} >= 3
x 10^{10} M_{sun}. The z~1 disk-like LIRGs are comparable or ~20% small at a
maximum in size compared to local disk-like galaxies in the same stellar mass
range. If we examine rest-frame UV-optical morphologies using the HST/ACS
images, the rest-frame B-band sizes of the z~1 disk-like galaxies are
comparable to those of the local disk-like galaxies as reported by previous
studies on size evolution of disk-like galaxies in the rest-frame optical band.
Measuring color gradients (galaxy sizes as a function of wavelength) of the z~1
and local disk-like galaxies, we find that the z~1 disk-like galaxies have 3-5
times steeper color gradient than the local ones. Our results indicate that (i)
more than a half of relatively massive disk-like galaxies at z~1 are in violent
star formation epochs observed as LIRGs, and also (ii) most of those LIRGs are
constructing their fundamental disk structure vigorously. The high SFR density
in the universe at z~1 may be dominated by such star formation in disk region
in massive galaxies.

distributions of stars and dark matter, stellar kinematics, and stellar
population properties, in the extended, low surface brightness halo regions of
elliptical galaxies. With integral field absorption spectroscopy and with
planetary nebulae as tracers, velocity dispersion and rotation profiles have
been followed to ~4 and ~5-8 effective radii, respectively, and in M87 to the
outer edge at ~150 kpc. The results are generally consistent with the known
dichotomy of elliptical galaxy types, but some galaxies show more complex
rotation profiles in their halos and there is a higher incidence of
misalignments, indicating triaxiality. Dynamical models have shown a range of
slopes for the total mass profiles, and that the inner dark matter densities in
ellipticals are higher than in spiral galaxies, indicating earlier assembly
redshifts. Analysis of the hot X-ray emitting gas in X-ray bright ellipticals
and comparison with dynamical mass determinations indicates that non-thermal
components to the pressure may be important in the inner ~10 kpc, and that the
properties of these systems are closely related to their group environments.
First results on the outer halo stellar population properties do not yet give a
clear picture. In the halo of one bright galaxy, lower [alpha/Fe] abundances
indicate longer star formation histories pointing towards late accretion of the
halo. This is consistent with independent evidence for on-going accretion, and
suggests a connection to the observed size evolution of elliptical galaxies
with redshift.

fields. We here present complementary observations of the ADF-S conducted by

source catalogs at each of these wavelengths reaching depths of ~ 0.2mJy at 24
micron and ~ 20mJy at 70 micron. We also apply an K-to-24 micron colour
criterion to select objects with galaxy-like colours in the 24 micron survey.
Completeness corrections as a function of flux density are derived for both
catalogs by injecting artificial sources of known flux density into the maps,
and we find that our surbveys are 50% complete at 0.26mJy and 24mJy at 24 and

density for the ADF-S at 24 and 70 micron. These are combined with existing
literature counts and compared to four different number count models derived
from galaxy evolution models. One complicating factor for the ADF-S counts is
the presence of a foreground galaxy cluster at z=0.04 in the field. We examine
the ranges of flux densities to which this cluster might make a contribution to
the counts and find hints that the 24 micron luminosity function of the cluster
galaxies might be enhanced above that of field galaxies. Full catalogs for
these ADF-S Spitzer surveys at 24 and 70 micron are made available as part of

the large fraction of binaries and accretion disks, probably related with the

target for studying the relation between X-ray emission and those stellar

PWDetect. General coronal properties were derived from plasma model fitting. We
also determined variability of the Eta Chamaleontis members in the EPIC

events and pseudo-quiescent state separately. In our observations, stars that

interpret generic configurations in this space as bounded convex polyhedra in
Euclidean space: a polyhedron is uniquely described by the areas and normals to

give formulas for the edge lengths, the volume and the adjacency of its faces.
At the quantum level, this correspondence allows us to identify an intertwiner
with the state of a quantum polyhedron, thus generalizing the notion of quantum
tetrahedron familiar in the loop quantum gravity literature. Moreover, coherent
intertwiners result to be peaked on the classical geometry of polyhedra. We
discuss the relevance of this result for loop quantum gravity. In particular,
coherent spin-network states with nodes of arbitrary valence represent a
collection of semiclassical polyhedra. Furthermore, we introduce an operator
that measures the volume of a quantum polyhedron and examine its relation with
the standard volume operator of loop quantum gravity. We also comment on the

read out and they suffer from read noise. These problems combine to make
high-speed spectroscopy of faint targets the most demanding of astronomical
observations. It is possible to overcome these weaknesses by using
electron-multiplying CCDs (EMCCDs). EMCCDs are conventional frame-transfer
CCDs, but with an extended serial register containing high-voltage electrodes.
An avalanche of secondary electrons is produced as the photon-generated
electrons are clocked through this register, resulting in signal amplification
that renders the read noise negligible. Using a combination of laboratory
measurements with the QUCAM2 EMCCD camera and Monte Carlo modelling, we show
that it is possible to significantly increase the signal-to-noise ratio of an
observation by using an EMCCD, but only if it is optimised and utilised
correctly. We also show that even greater gains are possible through the use of
photon counting. We present a recipe for astronomers to follow when setting up
a typical EMCCD observation which ensures that maximum signal-to-noise ratio is
obtained. We also discuss the benefits that EMCCDs would bring if used with the
next generation of extremely large telescopes. Although we mainly consider the
spectroscopic use of EMCCDs, our conclusions are equally applicable to imaging.

to the inner mass distribution) and weak lensing (which can probe haloes out to

SrTiO3 is the preferred template to create exotic two-dimensional (2D) phases

superconductivity, or large negative magnetoresistance. However, the physical
nature of the electronic structure underlying these 2D electron gases (2DEGs)
remains elusive, although its determination is crucial to understand their
remarkable properties. Here we show, using angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (ARPES), that there is a highly metallic universal 2DEG at the
vacuum-cleaved surface of SrTiO3, independent of bulk carrier densities over
more than seven decades, including the undoped insulating material. This 2DEG
is confined within a region of ~5 unit cells with a sheet carrier density of
~0.35 electrons per a^2 (a is the cubic lattice parameter). We unveil a
remarkable electronic structure consisting on multiple subbands of heavy and
light electrons. The similarity of this 2DEG with those reported in
SrTiO3-based heterostructures and field-effect transistors suggests that
different forms of electron confinement at the surface of SrTiO3 lead to
essentially the same 2DEG. Our discovery provides a model system for the study
of the electronic structure of 2DEGs in SrTiO3-based devices, and a novel route
to generate 2DEGs at surfaces of transition-metal oxides.

starvation. Prior works focused almost exclusively on equilibrium starvation.
In this paper, we show that links in CSMA wireless networks are also
susceptible to temporal starvation. Specifically, although some links have good
equilibrium throughputs and do not suffer from equilibrium starvation, they can
still have no throughput for extended periods from time to time. Given its
impact on quality of service, it is important to understand and characterize
temporal starvation. To this end, we develop a ""trap theory"" to analyze
temporal throughput fluctuation. The trap theory serves two functions. First,
it allows us to derive new mathematical results that shed light on the
transient behavior of CSMA networks. For example, we show that the duration of
a trap, during which some links receive no throughput, is insensitive to the
distributions of the backoff countdown and transmission time (packet duration)
in the CSMA protocol. Second, we can develop analytical tools for computing the
""degrees of starvation"" for CSMA networks to aid network design. For example,
given a CSMA network, we can determine whether it suffers from starvation, and
if so, which links will starve. Furthermore, the likelihood and durations of
temporal starvation can also be computed. We believe that the ability to
identify and characterize temporal starvation as established in this paper will
serve as an important first step toward the design of effective remedies for
it.

more tractable way than other many-body methods. We sketch the corresponding
diagrammatical analysis, which leads to an exact asymptotic expansion for the

infer the HI densities and temperatures in the cosmological box. The UV
background (UVB) and additional QSO radiation with Lyman limit flux of L_{\nu
LL} = 1e31 and 1e32 erg / Hz s are implemented with a radiative transfer code
until an equilibrium configuration is reached. We analyse mock spectra
originating at the QSO in the most massive halo, in a random filament and in a
void. The proximity effect is studied using flux transmission statistics, in
particular with the normalised optical depth.
  Beyond a radius of r > 1 Mpc / h from the quasar, we measure a transmission
profile consistent with geometric dilution of the QSO ionising radiation. A
departure from geometric dilution is only seen, when strong absorbers intervene
the line-of-sight. The cosmic density distribution around the QSO causes a
large scatter in the normalised optical depth. The scatter decreases with
increasing redshift and increasing QSO luminosity. The mean proximity effect
provides an average signal that is biased by random large scale density
enhancements on scales up to r \approx 15 Mpc / h. The distribution of the
proximity effect strength provides a measure of the proximity effect along
individual lines of sight. It shows a clear maximum almost without an
environmental bias. Therefore it can be used for an unbiased estimate of the
UVB. Differing spectral energy distributions between the QSO and the UVB modify
the profile which can be reasonably well corrected analytically. A few Lyman

effect due to shadowing.

use of the HH basis is possible, even if the basis has not a well defined
behavior under particle permutations. In fact, after the diagonalization of the
Hamiltonian matrix, the eigenvectors reflect the symmetries present in it. They
have well defined symmetry under particle permutation and the identification of
the physical states is possible, as it will be shown in specific cases. The
problem related to the large degeneration of the basis is circumvented by
constructing the Hamiltonian matrix as a sum of products of sparse matrices.
This particular representation of the Hamiltonian is well suited for a
numerical iterative diagonalization, where only the action of the matrix on a

$A=3-6$ particles interacting through a short-range central interaction. We
also consider the case in which the potential is restricted to act in relative

an adequate treatment of noise. Unlike to usual experiments in particle
physics, where noise always adds to the signal, radio noise can in principle
decrease or increase the signal if it interferes by chance destructively or
constructively. Consequently, noise cannot simply be subtracted from the
signal, and its influence on amplitude and time measurement of radio pulses
must be studied with care. First, noise has to be determined consistently with
the definition of the radio signal which typically is the maximum field
strength of the radio pulse. Second, the average impact of noise on radio pulse
measurements at individual antennas is studied for LOPES. It is shown that a
correct treatment of noise is especially important at low signal-to-noise
ratios: noise can be the dominant source of uncertainty for pulse height and
time measurements, and it can systematically flatten the slope of lateral
distributions. The presented method can also be transfered to other experiments
in radio and acoustic detection of cosmic rays and neutrinos.

treated as a continuous field locally biased with respect to the underlying
mass distribution. In the peak model pioneered by BBKS, one considers instead
density maxima of the initial, Gaussian mass density field as an approximation
to the formation site of virialized objects. In this paper, the peak model is
extended in two ways to improve its predictive accuracy. Firstly, we derive the
two-point correlation function of initial density peaks up to second order and
demonstrate that a peak-background split approach can be applied to obtain the
k-independent and k-dependent peak bias factors at all orders. Secondly, we
explore the gravitational evolution of the peak correlation function within the
Zel'dovich approximation. We show that the local (Lagrangian) bias approach
emerges as a special case of the peak model, in which all bias parameters are
scale-independent and there is no statistical velocity bias. We apply our
formulae to study how the Lagrangian peak biasing, the diffusion due to large
scale flows and the mode-coupling due to nonlocal interactions affect the scale
dependence of bias from small separations up to the baryon acoustic oscillation
(BAO) scale. For 2-sigma density peaks collapsing at z=0.3, our model predicts
a ~ 5% residual scale-dependent bias around the acoustic scale that arises
mostly from first-order Lagrangian peak biasing (as opposed to second-order
gravity mode-coupling). We also search for a scale dependence of bias in the
large scale auto-correlation of massive halos extracted from a very large
N-body simulation provided by the MICE collaboration. For halos with mass
M>10^{14}Msun/h, our measurements demonstrate a scale-dependent bias across the
BAO feature which is very well reproduced by a prediction based on the peak
model.

fluctuation model on the simple cubic lattice, we vary the backbone chain
length $N_b$ from $N_b=67$ to $N_b = 259$ effective monomeric units, the side
chain length $N$ from N=6 to N=48, and the grafting density $\sigma=1$, i.e.,

$\epsilon_c$ as for ordinary linear chains (N=0), at least within our

Matrix Expansion (DME) to the Hartree-Fock energy obtained from chiral
effective field theory (EFT) two- and three-nucleon interactions. Due to the
structure of the chiral interactions, each coupling in the DME functional is
given as the sum of a coupling constant arising from zero-range contact
interactions and a coupling function of the density arising from the
finite-range pion exchanges. Since the contact contributions have essentially
the same structure as those entering empirical Skyrme functionals, a
microscopically guided Skyrme phenomenology has been suggested in which the
contact terms in the DME functional are released for optimization to
finite-density observables to capture short-range correlation energy
contributions from beyond Hartree-Fock. The present paper is the first attempt
to assess the ability of the newly suggested DME functional, which has a much
richer set of density dependencies than traditional Skyrme functionals, to
generate sensible and stable results for nuclear applications. The results of
the first proof-of-principle calculations are given, and numerous practical
issues related to the implementation of the new functional in existing Skyrme
codes are discussed. Using a restricted singular value decomposition (SVD)
optimization procedure, it is found that the new DME functional gives
numerically stable results and exhibits a small but systematic reduction of our
test $\chi^2$ function compared to standard Skyrme functionals, thus justifying
its suitability for future global optimizations and large-scale calculations.

"1009.3460","Oded Regev","Amit Chakrabarti, Oded Regev","An Optimal Lower Bound on the Communication Complexity of
  Gap-Hamming-Distance",,,,,"cs.CC math.MG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We prove an optimal $\Omega(n)$ lower bound on the randomized communication
complexity of the much-studied Gap-Hamming-Distance problem. As a consequence,
we obtain essentially optimal multi-pass space lower bounds in the data stream
model for a number of fundamental problems, including the estimation of
frequency moments.
  The Gap-Hamming-Distance problem is a communication problem, wherein Alice
and Bob receive $n$-bit strings $x$ and $y$, respectively. They are promised
that the Hamming distance between $x$ and $y$ is either at least $n/2+\sqrt{n}$
or at most $n/2-\sqrt{n}$, and their goal is to decide which of these is the
case. Since the formal presentation of the problem by Indyk and Woodruff (FOCS,
2003), it had been conjectured that the naive protocol, which uses $n$ bits of
communication, is asymptotically optimal. The conjecture was shown to be true
in several special cases, e.g., when the communication is deterministic, or
when the number of rounds of communication is limited.
  The proof of our aforementioned result, which settles this conjecture fully,
is based on a new geometric statement regarding correlations in Gaussian space,
related to a result of C. Borell (1985). To prove this geometric statement, we
show that random projections of not-too-small sets in Gaussian space are close
to a mixture of translated normal variables.

universe is made up of 70% of dark-energy and 25% of dark-matter. Dark-energy
is responsible for acceleration of the expanding universe; whereas dark-matter
is said to be necessary as extra-mass of bizarre-properties to explain the
anomalous rotational-velocity of galaxy. Though the existence of dark-energy
has gradually been accepted in scientific community, but the candidates for
dark-matter have not been found as yet and are too crazy to be accepted. Thus,
it is obvious to look for an alternative theory in place of dark-matter.
Israel-scientist M. Milgrom has suggested a 'Modified Newtonian Dynamics
(MOND)' which appears to be highly successful for explaining the anomalous
rotational-velocity. But unfortunately MOND lacks theoretical support. The
MOND, in-fact, is (empirical) modification of Newtonian-Dynamics through
modification in the kinematical acceleration term 'a' (which is normally taken
as $a=\frac{v^{2}}{r}$) as effective kinematic acceleration $a_{effective} = a
\mu (\frac{a}{a_{0}})$, wherein the $\mu$-function is 1 for usual-values of
accelerations but equals to $\frac{a}{a_{0}} (\ll 1)$ if the acceleration 'a'
is extremely-low lower than a critical value $a_0 (10^{-10} m/s^{2})$. In the
present paper, a novel variant of MOND is proposed with theoretical backing;
wherein with the consideration of universe's acceleration $a_{d}$ due to
dark-energy, a new type of $\mu$-function on theoretical-basis emerges out
leading to $a_{effective} = a(1 - K \frac{a_{0}}{a})$. The proposed
theoretical-MOND model too is able to fairly explain qualitatively the
more-or-less 'flat' velocity-curve of galaxy-rotation, and is also able to
predict a dip (minimum) on the curve.

Seyfert galaxy Mrk1066 derived from J and Kl bands data obtained with the
Gemini NIFS at a spatial resolution of 35 pc. The stellar velocity field is
dominated by rotation in the galaxy plane but shows an S-shape distortion along
the galaxy minor axis which seems to be due to an oval structure seen in an
optical continuum image. Along this oval, between 170 and 280 pc from the
nucleus we find a partial ring of low sigma (~50 km/s) attributed to an
intermediate age stellar population. Fro measurements of the emission-line
fluxes and profiles ([PII]1.19um, [FeII]1.26um, Pa-beta and H2 2.12um), we have
constructed maps for the gas centroid velocity, velocity dispersion, as well as
channel maps. The velocity fields for all emission lines are dominated by a
similar rotation pattern to that observed for the stars, but are distorted by
the presence of two structures: (i) a compact rotating disc with radius r~70
pc; (ii) outflows along the radio jet which is oriented approximately along the
galaxy major axis. The compact rotating disc is more conspicuous in the H2
emitting gas, which presents the smallest sigma values and most clear rotation
pattern, supporting a location in the galaxy plane. We estimate a gas mass for
the disc of ~10^7Msun. The H2 kinematics further suggests that the nuclear disc
is being fed by gas coming from the outer regions. The outflow is more
conspicuous in the [FeII] emitting gas, which presents the highest sigma values
(up to 150 km/s) and the highest blue and redshifts of up to 500 km/s, while
the highest stellar rotation velocity is only 130 km/s. We estimate a
mass-outflow rate in ionized gas of 0.06 Msun/yr. The derived kinematics for
the emitting gas is similar to that observed in previous studies supporting
that the H2 is a tracer of the AGN feeding and the [FeII] of its feedback.
