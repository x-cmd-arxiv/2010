representing massive string. The energy-momentum tensor for such string as
formulated by Letelier (1983) is used to construct massive string cosmological
models for which we assume that the shear scalar ($\sigma$) is proportional to
the expansion scalar ($\theta$). The study reveals that massive strings
dominate the early Universe. The strings eventually disappear from the Universe
for sufficiently large time, which is in agreement with the current
astronomical observations. Some physical and geometrical behaviour of models

under vacuum UV synchrotron radiation as a function of temperature between 10
and 300 K. Kramers-Kronig dispersion analysis of reflectivity spectra allowed
us to determine the absorption coefficient in the range from 8 to 17.5 eV.
Spectra show four main peaks, the spectral positions of which are consistent
with literature data. An appreciable dependence of the line-shape on
temperature is observed for the first two peaks only. We demonstrate the
exciton peak at 10.4 eV to have a very good Lorentzian band-shape at all the
examined temperatures. Based on existing theoretical models, this allows to
argue excitons in SiO2 to be weakly scattered by phonons, thus retaining their
mobility properties notwithstanding the effects of exciton-phonon coupling and
of intrinsic structural disorder of amorphous SiO2. Moreover, the observed
temperature dependence of the peak position together with the features of the
Urbach absorption tail and of self-trapped exciton emission allow us to
estimate the main parameters ruling exciton dynamics in SiO2. The features of
the intrinsic Urbach absorption tail can be satisfactorily explained as a
consequence of those of the first excitonic peak, supporting the interpretation
of the Urbach tail in SiO2 as a consequence of the momentary self-trapping of
the 10.4 eV exciton. Finally, the characteristics of the other energy peaks are
discussed and an excitonic origin also for the 11.6 eV peak is put forward. On
the whole, our results show that exciton dynamics accounts for all optical
properties of pure silicon dioxide from 8 up to 11 eV.

the mere existence of these clusters. At the 95% confidence level, fnl>467 with
cosmological parameters fixed to their most likely WMAP5 values, or fnl > 123

fundamental problem in signal processing and statistics which has become a
subject of interest in recent years. In general, these systems have infinitely
many solutions. However, it may be shown that sufficiently sparse solutions may
be identified uniquely. In other words, the corresponding linear transformation
will be invertible if we restrict its domain to sufficiently sparse vectors.
This property may be used, for example, to solve the underdetermined Blind
Source Separation (BSS) problem, or to find sparse representation of a signal
in an `overcomplete' dictionary of primitive elements (i.e., the so-called
atomic decomposition). The main drawback of current methods of finding sparse
solutions is their computational complexity. In this paper, we will show that
by detecting `active' components of the (potential) solution, i.e., those
components having a considerable value, a framework for fast solution of the
problem may be devised. The idea leads to a family of algorithms, called
`Iterative Detection-Estimation (IDE)', which converge to the solution by
successive detection and estimation of its active part. Comparing the
performance of IDE(s) with one of the most successful method to date, which is
based on Linear Programming (LP), an improvement in speed of about two to three
orders of magnitude is observed.

presence of an eavesdropper with arbitrary correlated side informations at the
legitimate decoder (referred to as Bob) and the eavesdropper (referred to as
Eve). This scenario consists of an encoder that wishes to compress a source to
satisfy the desired requirements on: (i) the distortion level at Bob and (ii)
the equivocation rate at Eve. It is assumed that the decoders have access to
correlated sources as side information. For instance, this problem can be seen
as a generalization of the well-known Wyner-Ziv problem taking into account the
security requirements. A complete characterization of the
rate-distortion-equivocation region for the case of arbitrary correlated side
informations at the decoders is derived. Several special cases of interest and
an application example to secure lossy source coding of binary sources in the
presence of binary and ternary side informations are also considered. It is
shown that the statistical differences between the side information at the
decoders and the presence of non-zero distortion at the legitimate decoder can
be useful in terms of secrecy. Applications of these results arise in a variety
of distributed sensor network scenarios.

languages but very few methods. We also propose the idea of Layered Fault
Tolerant Specification (LFTS) to make the method extensible to dependable
systems. The principle is layering the specification, for the sake of clarity,
in (at least) two different levels, the first one for the normal behavior and
the others (if more than one) for the abnormal. The abnormal behavior is
described in terms of an Error Injector (EI) which represents a model of the
erroneous interference coming from the environment. This structure has been
inspired by the notion of idealized fault tolerant component but the
combination of LFTS and EI using rely guarantee thinking to describe
interference can be considered one of the main contributions of this work. The
progress toward this method and the way to layer specifications has been made

estimates of V-band polarimetry of a group of CEMP stars. V-band polarimetry
was planned as the V-band is known to show maximum polarization among BVRI
polarimetry for any scattering of light caused due to dust. Based on these
estimates the program stars show a distinct classification into two: one with
p% < 0.4 and the other with p% > 1. Stars with circumstellar material exhibit a
certain amount of polarization that may be caused by scattering of starlight
due to circumstellar dust distribution into non-spherically symmetric
envelopes. The degree of polarization increases with asymmetries present in the
geometry of the circumstellar dust distribution. Our results reflect upon these
properties. While the sample size is relatively small, the polarimetric
separation of the two groups (p% < 0.4 and p% > 1) is very distinct; this

is a $q$-deformation of the classical Clifford algebra. The tensor space $
U_q(\g) \otimes \mathrm{cl}_q(\g)$ is given a structure of the adjoint module
of the quantum group and the Dirac operator is invariant under this action. The
purpose of this approach is to construct equivariant Fredholm modules and
$K$-homology cycles. This work generalizes the operator introduced by Bibikov

with its truth value in a many-valued and context-dependent logic. In short,
probability is degree of truth. These ideas appear to be new (though I expect

infinity) for i.i.d. Rayleigh fading channel by Zheng and Tse [1]. The
SNR-asymptotic DMT overestimates the finite-SNR one [2]. This paper outlines a
number of additional limitations and difficulties of the DMT framework and
discusses their implications. Using the recent results on the size-asymptotic
(in the number of antennas) outage capacity distribution, the finite-SNR,
size-asymptotic DMT is derived for a broad class of fading distributions. The
SNR range over which the finite-SNR DMT is accurately approximated by the
SNR-asymptotic one is characterized. The multiplexing gain definition is shown
to affect critically this range and thus should be carefully selected, so that
the SNR-asymptotic DMT is an accurate approximation at realistic SNR values and
thus has operational significance to be used as a design criteria. The finite
SNR diversity gain is shown to decrease with correlation and power imbalance in
a broad class of fading channels, and such an effect is described in a compact,
closed form. Complete characterization of the outage probability (or outage
capacity) requires not only the finite-SNR DMT, but also the SNR offset, which
is introduced and investigated as well. This offset, which is not accounted for
in the DMT framework, is shown to have a significant impact on the outage
probability for a broad class of fading channels, especially when the
multiplexing gain is small. The analytical results and conclusions are
validated via extensive Monte-Carlo simulations. Overall, the size-asymptotic
DMT represents a valuable alternative to the SNR-asymptotic one.

about half the regions have near infrared photometry that suggests they may be

have spectrophotometric parallaxes which support smaller distances. These
discrepancies between kinematic and spectrophotometric distances are not due to

be described within the impulse approximation. The traditional impulse

identity of dark matter. The current bound on the spin-independent scattering
cross section is sigma^SI < 10 zb for dark matter masses m_chi ~ 100 GeV, with
improved sensitivities expected soon. We examine the implications of this
progress for neutralino dark matter. We work in a supersymmetric framework
well-suited to dark matter studies that is simple and transparent, with models
defined in terms of four weak-scale parameters. We first show that robust
constraints on electric dipole moments motivate large sfermion masses mtilde >
1 TeV, effectively decoupling squarks and sleptons from neutralino dark matter
phenomenology. In this case, we find characteristic cross sections in the
narrow range 1 zb < sigma^SI < 40 zb for m_chi > 70 GeV. As sfermion masses are
lowered to near their experimental limit mtilde ~ 400 GeV, the upper and lower
limits of this range are extended, but only by factors of around two, and the
lower limit is not significantly altered by relaxing many particle physics
assumptions, varying the strange quark content of the nucleon, including the
effects of galactic small-scale structure, or assuming other components of dark
matter. Experiments are therefore rapidly entering the heart of dark
matter-favored supersymmetry parameter space. If no signal is seen,
supersymmetric models must contain some level of fine-tuning, and we identify
and analyze several possibilities. Barring large cancellations, however, in a
large and generic class of models, if thermal relic neutralinos are a
significant component of dark matter, experiments will discover them as they
probe down to the zeptobarn scale.

Expressions for the relevant metric perturbations in familiar coordinate

allows for future analysis of anisotropic matter sources in a more general

the break-up limit. Mergers between two stars in a binary are expected to
result in massive, fast rotating stars. These rapid rotators may appear as Be
or Oe stars or at low metallicity they may be progenitors of long gamma-ray
bursts.
  Given the high frequency of massive stars in close binaries it seems likely
that a large fraction of rapidly rotating stars result from binary interaction.
It is not straightforward to distinguish a a fast rotator that was born as a
rapidly rotating single star from a fast rotator that resulted from some kind
of binary interaction. Rapidly rotating stars resulting from binary interaction
will often appear to be single because the companion tends to be a low mass,
low luminosity star in a wide orbit. Alternatively, they became single stars
after a merger or disruption of the binary system during the supernova
explosion of the primary.
  The absence of evidence for a companion does not guarantee that the system
did not experience binary interaction in the past. If binary interaction is one
of the main causes of high stellar rotation rates, the binary fraction is
expected to be smaller among fast rotators. How this prediction depend on
uncertainties in the physics of the binary interactions requires further
investigation.

the temperature dependence of the in-plane London penetration depth
$\Delta\lambda(T)$, and therefore the superfluid phase stiffness
$\lambda^2(0)/\lambda^2(T)$ was measured. Down to 0.4 K, the data do not show
the exponential saturation at low temperatures expected from a singly-,
fully-gapped superconductor. Rather, both the electron- and the hole-doped
systems seem to be best described by a power law behavior, with
$\lambda^2(0)/\lambda^2(T)$ $\sim$ $T^n$ and \emph{n} $\approx$ 2.5. In the
three samples we studied, a weak feature near the sensitivity limit of our
measurements appears near $T/T_\mathrm{c}$ =~0.04, hinting at a corresponding
low energy feature in the superconducting density of states. The data can also
be relatively well-described by a simple two-gap s-wave model of the order
parameter, but this yields parameters which seem unrealistic and dependent on
the fit range. Broadband surface resistance measurements reveal a sample
dependent residual loss whose origin is unclear. The data from the \FeAs
samples can be made to scale as $\omega^2$ if the extrinsic loss is treated as
an additive component, indicating large scattering rates. Finally, the

very similar to those observed for $\Delta\lambda(T)$.

  We identify 16 afterglows of the former type, 17 of the latter, and 4 with
broad peaks, that could be of either type. The optical energy release of these
two classes is similar and is correlated with the GRB output, the correlation
being stronger for peaky afterglows, which suggests that the burst and
afterglow emissions of peaky afterglows are from the same relativistic ejecta
and that the optical emission of afterglows with plateaus arises more often
from ejecta that did not produce the burst emission.
  Consequently, we propose that peaky optical afterglows are from impulsive
ejecta releases and that plateau optical afterglows originate from long-lived
engines, the break in the optical light-curve (peak or plateau end) marking the
onset of the entire outflow deceleration.
  In the peak luminosity--peak time plane, the distribution of peaky afterglows
displays an edge with L_p \propto t_p^{-3}, which we attribute to variations
(among afterglows) in the ambient medium density. The fluxes and epochs of
optical plateau breaks follow a L_b \propto t_b^{-1} anticorrelation.
  Sixty percent of 25 afterglows that were well-monitored in the optical and
X-rays show light-curves with comparable power-law decays indices and
achromatic breaks. The other 40 percent display three types of decoupled
behaviours: i) chromatic optical light-curve breaks (perhaps due to the peak of
the synchrotron spectrum crossing the optical), ii) X-ray flux decays faster
than in the optical (suggesting that the X-ray emission is from local
inverse-Compton scattering), and iii) chromatic X-ray light-curve breaks
(indicating that the X-ray emission is from external up-scattering).

areas of queueing theory. Barring very specialized models such as product-form
type queueing networks, there exist very few results which provide provable
non-asymptotic upper and lower bounds on key performance measures. In this
paper we propose a new performance analysis method, which is based on the
robust optimization. The basic premise of our approach is as follows: rather
than assuming that the stochastic primitives of a queueing model satisfy
certain probability laws, such as, for example, i.i.d. interarrival and service
times distributions, we assume that the underlying primitives are deterministic
and satisfy the implications of such probability laws. These implications take
the form of simple linear constraints, namely, those motivated by the Law of
the Iterated Logarithm (LIL).
  Using this approach we are able to obtain performance bounds on some key
performance measures. Furthermore, these performance bounds imply similar
bounds in the underlying stochastic queueing models.
  We demonstrate our approach on two types of queueing networks: a) Tandem
Single Class queue- ing network and b) Multiclass Single Server queueing
network. In both cases, using the proposed robust optimization approach, we are
able to obtain explicit upper bounds on some steady-state performance measures.
For example, for the case of TSC system we obtain a bound of the form
$\frac{C}{1-\rho} \ln \ln(1/(1-\rho))$ on the expected steady-state sojourn
time, where C is an explicit constant and $\rho$ is the bottleneck traffic
intensity. This qualitatively agrees with the correct heavy traffic scaling of
this performance measure up to the $ln ln(1/(1-\rho))$ correction factor.

free probabilistic, setting some recent results by Nualart and Peccati on
characterizations of central limit theorems in a fixed order of Gaussian Wiener
chaos. Our proof is combinatorial, analyzing the relevant noncrossing
partitions that control the moments of the integrals. We can also use these
techniques to distinguish the first order of chaos from all others in terms of

quantitative bounds on a distance between different orders of chaos. When

arbitrary networks. RSR is a graph renormalization procedure that locally
aggregates nodes to produce a coarse grained network. It is analogous to the
(quasi-)parallel renormalization schemes introduced by C. Song {\it et al.}
(Nature {\bf 433}, 392 (2005)) and studied more recently by F. Radicchi {\it et
al.} (Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 101}, 148701 (2008)), but much simpler and easier
to implement. In this first paper we apply RSR to critical trees and derive
analytical results consistent with numerical simulations. Critical trees
exhibit three regimes in their evolution under RSR: (i) An initial regime
$N_0^{\nu}\lesssim N<N_0$, where $N$ is the number of nodes at some step in the
renormalization and $N_0$ is the initial size. RSR in this regime is described
by a mean field theory and fluctuations from one realization to another are
small. The exponent $\nu=1/2$ is derived using random walk arguments. The
degree distribution becomes broader under successive renormalization --
reaching a power law, $p_k\sim 1/k^{\gamma}$ with $\gamma=2$ and a variance
that diverges as $N_0^{1/2}$ at the end of this regime. Both of these results
are derived based on a scaling theory. (ii) An intermediate regime for
$N_0^{1/4}\lesssim N \lesssim N_0^{1/2}$, in which hubs develop, and
fluctuations between different realizations of the RSR are large. Crossover
functions exhibiting finite size scaling, in the critical region $N\sim
N_0^{1/2} \to \infty$, connect the behaviors in the first two regimes. (iii)
The last regime, for $1 \ll N\lesssim N_0^{1/4}$, is characterized by the
appearance of star configurations with a central hub surrounded by many leaves.
The distribution of sizes where stars first form is found numerically to be a
power law up to a cutoff that scales as $N_0^{\nu_{star}}$ with
$\nu_{star}\approx 1/4$.

probability by selecting numbers between $N$ and 2N at random and testing each
one in turn for primality until a prime is discovered. However, if one seeks a
deterministic method, then the problem is much more difficult, unless one
assumes some unproven conjectures in number theory; brute force methods give a
$O(N^{1+o(1)})$ algorithm, and the best unconditional algorithm, due to
Odlyzko, has a run time of $O(N^{1/2 + o(1)})$.
  In this paper we discuss an approach that may improve upon the

$O(N^{1/2-c})$ for some $c>0$ whether a given interval in $[N,2N]$ contains a
prime. While this strategy has not been fully implemented, it can be used to
establish partial results, such as being able to determine the \emph{parity} of
the number of primes in a given interval in $[N,2N]$ in time $O(N^{1/2-c})$.

like the ring $S \star K$.
  The rings produced in this manner exhibit pathological features, such as
failing to have finite normalization, but in spite of this they are quite
tractable and conceptually (if not practically) easy to locate, and in this way
provide a rich but manageable source of non-standard Noetherian rings.

networks with Markov-modeled outage channels. We consider the scenario in which
the scheduler does not have full knowledge of the channel state information,
but instead estimates the channel state information by exploiting the memory
inherent in the Markov channels along with ARQ-styled feedback from the
scheduled users. Opportunistic scheduling is optimized in two stages: (1)
Channel estimation and rate adaptation to maximize the expected immediate rate
of the scheduled user; (2) User scheduling, based on the optimized immediate
rate, to maximize the overall long term sum-throughput of the downlink. The
scheduling problem is a partially observable Markov decision process with the
classic 'exploitation vs exploration' trade-off that is difficult to quantify.
We therefore study the problem in the framework of Restless Multi-armed Bandit
Processes (RMBP) and perform a Whittle's indexability analysis. Whittle's
indexability is traditionally known to be hard to establish and the index
policy derived based on Whittle's indexability is known to have optimality
properties in various settings. We show that the problem of downlink scheduling
under imperfect channel state information is Whittle indexable and derive the
Whittle's index policy in closed form. Via extensive numerical experiments, we
show that the index policy has near-optimal performance.
  Our work reveals that, under incomplete channel state information, exploiting
channel memory for opportunistic scheduling can result in significant
performance gains and that almost all of these gains can be realized using an
easy-to-implement index policy.

over the past decade or so. MCs can start out as cold atomic clouds formed by
compressive motions in the warm neutral medium (WNM) of galaxies. Such motions
can be driven by large-scale instabilities, or by local turbulence. The
compressions induce a phase transition to the cold neutral medium (CNM) to form
growing cold atomic clouds, which in their early stages may constitute thin CNM
sheets. Several dynamical instabilities soon destabilize a cloud, rendering it
turbulent. For solar neighborhood conditions, a cloud is coincidentally
expected to become molecular, magnetically supercritical, and gravitationally
dominated at roughly the same column density, $N \sim 1.5 \times 10^21 \psc
\approx 10 \Msun$ pc$^{-2}$. At this point, the cloud begins to contract
gravitationally. However, before its global collapse is completed ($\sim 10^7$
yr later), the nonlinear density fluctuations within the cloud, which have
shorter local free-fall times, collapse first and begin forming stars, a few
Myr after the global contraction started. Large-scale fluctuations of lower
mean densities collapse later, so the formation of massive star-forming regions
is expected to occur late in the evolution of a large cloud complex, while
scattered low-mass regions are expected to form earlier. Eventually, the local
star formation episodes are terminated by stellar feedback, which disperses the
local dense gas, although more work is necessary to clarify the details and
characteristic scales of this process.

overview of the field, we present a new ab initio many-body approach capable of
describing simultaneously both bound and scattering states in light nuclei. By
combining the resonating-group method with the ab initio no-core shell model,
we complement a microscopic cluster technique with the use of realistic
interactions and a microscopic and consistent description of the clusters. We
show results for neutron and proton scattering on light nuclei, including p-7Be

electromagnetic fields and sources on accelerated frames. The purpose is to
study several configurations of fields and observers that in the literature are
understood as paradoxes. For instance, are the two situations, (i) an
accelerated charge in an inertial frame, and (ii) a charge at rest in an
inertial frame described from the perspective of an accelerated frame,
physically equivalent? Is the electromagnetic radiation the same in both
frames? Normally in the analysis of these paradoxes the electromagnetic fields
are transformed to (uniformly) accelerated frames by means of a coordinate
transformation of the Faraday tensor. In the present approach coordinate and
frame transformations are disentangled, and the electromagnetic field in the
accelerated frame is obtained through a frame (local Lorentz) transformation.
Consequently the fields in the inertial and accelerated frames are described in
the same coordinate system. This feature allows the investigation of paradoxes
such as the one mentioned above.

ejected from a fast-spinning central star. This material possesses large

star. This simple description outlines the basic issues that a successful disc
theory must address: 1) What is the mechanism responsible for the mass
ejection? 2) What is the final configuration of the material? 3) How the disc
grows? With the very high angular resolution that can be achieved with modern
interferometers operating in the optical and infrared we can now resolve the
photosphere and immediate vicinity of nearby Be stars. Those observations are
able to provide very stringent tests for our ideas about the physical processes
operating in those objects. This paper discusses the basic hydrodynamics of
viscous decretion discs around Be stars. The model predictions are
quantitatively compared to observations, demonstrating that the viscous
decretion scenario is currently the most viable theory to explain the discs

bloom--dates are quite accurate, but the predictive uncertainty is high,
possibly due to our crude climate model for predicting future temperature, the
time-dependent covariate in our regression model for phenological events. We
found that if we can manage to get accurate prediction of future temperature,

rates that are identical to those of a single 1D quantum channel connected to a
thermal reservoir at the Hawking temperature. The Landauer approach shows in a
direct way the particle statistics independence of the energy and entropy
fluxes of a black hole radiating into vacuum, as well as one near thermal

we show that Hawking radiation gives a net entropy production that is 50%

increases as one moves up the supply chain, is a major issue in Supply Chain

variance of the order process to that of the demand process), explicit formulas
are difficult to obtain. In this paper we investigate the theoretical and
practical issues of Zhang [Manufacturing and Services Operations Management 6-2

two-stage supply chain, the bullwhip effect is measured for an ARMA(p,q) demand
process admitting an infinite moving average representation. As particular
cases of this time series model, the AR(p), MA(q), ARMA(1,1), AR(1) and AR(2)
are discussed. For some of them, explicit formulas are obtained. We show that
for certain types of demand processes, the use of the optimal forecasting
procedure that minimizes the mean squared forecasting error leads to
significant reduction in the safety stock level. This highlights the potential
economic benefits resulting from the use of this time series analysis. Finally,
an R function called SCperf is programmed to calculate the bullwhip effect and
other supply chain performance variables. It leads to a simple but powerful
tool which could benefit both managers and researchers.

  Exact-match overlap graphs have been broadly used in the context of DNA
assembly and the \emph{shortest super string problem} where the number of
strings $n$ ranges from a couple of thousands to a couple of billions, the
length $\ell$ of the strings is from 25 to 1000, depending on DNA sequencing
technologies. However, many DNA assemblers using overlap graphs are facing a
major problem of constructing and storing them. Especially, it is impossible
for these DNA assemblers to handle the huge amount of data produced by the next
generation sequencing technologies where the number of strings $n$ is usually
very large ranging from hundred million to a couple of billions. In fact, to
our best knowledge there is no DNA assemblers that can handle such a large
number of strings. Fortunately, with our compact data structure, the major
problem of constructing and storing overlap graphs is practically solved since
it only requires linear time and and linear memory. As a result, it opens the
door of possibilities to build a DNA assembler that can handle large-scale

dynamically young, massive cluster RX J0152.7-1357 at z~0.84, aimed at
understanding the effects of the cluster environment on the star formation
history (SFH) of cluster galaxies and the assembly of the red-sequence (RS). We
use VLT/FORS spectroscopy, ACS/WFC optical and NTT/SofI near-IR data to
characterize SFHs as a function of color, luminosity, morphology, stellar mass,
and local environment from a sample of 134 spectroscopic members. In order to
increase the signal-to-noise, individual galaxy spectra are stacked according
to these properties. Moreover, the D4000, Balmer, CN3883, Fe4383 and C4668
indices are also quantified. The SFH analysis shows that galaxies in the blue
faint-end of the RS have on average younger stars (Delta t ~ 2 Gyr) than those
in the red bright-end. We also found, for a given luminosity range, differences
in age (Delta t ~ 0.5 - 1.3 Gyr) as a function of color, indicating that the
intrinsic scatter of the RS may be due to age variations. Passive galaxies in
the blue faint-end of the RS are preferentially located in the low density
areas of the cluster, likely being objects entering the RS from the ""blue
cloud"". It is likely that the quenching of the star formation of these RS
galaxies is due to interaction with the intracluster medium. Furthermore, the
SFH of galaxies in the RS as a function of stellar mass reveals signatures of
""downsizing"" in the overall cluster.

supernova remnants (SNRs) HB21 (G89.0+4.7) and CTB 1 (G116.9+0.2), two
well-known mixed-morphology (MM) SNRs. We find a marked contrast between the
X-ray properties of these SNRs: for HB21, the extracted ASCA spectra of the
northwest and southeast regions of the X-ray emitting plasma can be fit with a
single thermal model with marginally enhanced silicon and sulfur abundances.
For both of these regions, the derived column density and temperature are
N_H~0.3x10^22 cm^-2 and kT~0.7 keV, respectively. No significant spatial
differences in temperature or elemental abundances between the two regions are
detected and the X-ray-emitting plasma in both regions is close to ionization
equilibrium. Our Chandra spectral analysis of CTB 1 reveals that this source is
likely an oxygen-rich SNR with enhanced abundances of oxygen and neon. The
extracted ASCA spectra for the southwestern and northeastern regions of CTB 1
cannot be fit with a single thermal component. Based on our fits to these
spectra, we derive a column density N_H~0.6x10^22 cm^-2 and a temperature for
the soft thermal component of kT_soft~0.28 keV. The hard emission from the
southwest may be modeled with either a thermal component (kT_hard~3 keV) or by
a power law component (Gamma~2-3) while the hard emission from the northeast
may be modeled with a power law component (Gamma~1.4). We have also extracted
ASCA GIS spectra of the discrete X-ray source 1WGA J0001.4+6229 which is seen
in projection toward CTB 1. These spectra are best fit using a power-law model
with a photon index Gamma=2.2^{+0.5}_{-1.2} which is typical for featureless
power-law continua produced by rotation-powered pulsars. This source may be a
neutron star associated with CTB 1.

outflow. In the first method the outflow is assumed to be baryonic and is
accelerated by the thermal pressure, for which the final bulk Lorentz factor is
limited by the outflow luminosity as well as the initial radius of the outflow
getting accelerated. Such a method may be applied to a considerable fraction of
flares. The second method, based on the curvature effect interpretation of the
quick decline of the flare, can give a tightly constrained estimate of the bulk
Lorentz factor but can only be applied to a few giant flares. The results
obtained in these two different ways are consistent with each other. The
obtained bulk Lorentz factor (or just upper limit) of the X-ray flare outflows,
ranging from ten to a few hundred, is generally smaller than that of the

additional neutrino production modes, the neutrinos from muon decays, the

rules, which depends on the grammar type. A classification of grammars has been
made by Noam Chomsky, which led to four well-known types. Yet, there are other
types of grammars, which do not exactly fit in Chomsky's classification, such
as the two-level grammars. As their name suggests it, the main idea behind
these grammars is that they are composed of two grammars. Van Wijngaarden
grammars, particularly, are such grammars. They are interesting by their power
(expressiveness), which can be the same, under some hypotheses, as the most
powerful grammars of Chomsky's classification, i.e. Type 0 grammars. Another
point of interest is their relative conciseness and readability. Van
Wijngaarden grammars can describe static and dynamic semantic of a language.
So, by using them as a generative engine, it is possible to generate a possibly
infinite set of words, while assuring us that they all have the same semantic.
Moreover, they can describe K-ary codes, by describing the semantic of each

way of maintaining their competitiveness. Consequently, they cannot rely solely
on themselves, but must cooperate by combining their advantages. To obtain the
actual condition for this cooperation, a multi-layered network based on two
different types of data was investigated. The first type was transaction data
from Japanese firms. The network created from the data included 961,363 firms
and 7,808,760 links. The second type of data were from joint-patent
applications in Japan. The joint-patent application network included 54,197
nodes and 154,205 links. These two networks were merged into one network.
  The first anaysis was based on input-output tables and three different tables
were compared. The correlation coefficients between tables revealed that
transactions were more strongly tied to joint-patent applications than the
total amount of money. The total amount of money and transactions have few
relationships and these are probably connected to joint-patent applications in
different mechanisms. The second analysis was conducted based on the p* model.
Choice, multiplicity, reciprocity, multi-reciprocity and transitivity
configurations were evaluated. Multiplicity and reciprocity configurations were
significant in all the analyzed industries. The results for multiplicity meant
that transactions and joint-patent application links were closely related.
Multi-reciprocity and transitivity configurations were significant in some of
the analyzed industries. It was difficult to find any common characteristics in
the industries. Bayesian networks were used in the third analysis. The learned
structure revealed that if a transaction link between two firms is known, the
categories of firms' industries do not affect to the existence of a patent
link.

Soubie 2010, paper I) is implemented on realistic 3D cosmological simulations
and observed redshift catalogues (SDSS); it is found that DisPerSE traces
equally well the observed filaments, walls, and voids in both cases. In either
setting, filaments are shown to connect onto halos, outskirt walls, which
circumvent voids. Indeed this algorithm operates directly on the particles
without assuming anything about the distribution, and yields a natural
(topologically motivated) self-consistent criterion for selecting the
significance level of the identified structures. It is shown that this
extraction is possible even for very sparsely sampled point processes, as a
function of the persistence ratio. Hence astrophysicists should be in a
position to trace and measure precisely the filaments, walls and voids from
such samples and assess the confidence of the post-processed sets as a function
of this threshold, which can be expressed relative to the expected amplitude of
shot noise. In a cosmic framework, this criterion is comparable to friend of
friend for the identifications of peaks, while it also identifies the connected
filaments and walls, and quantitatively recovers the full set of topological
invariants (Betti numbers) {\sl directly from the particles} as a function of
the persistence threshold. This criterion is found to be sufficient even if one
particle out of two is noise, when the persistence ratio is set to 3-sigma or
more. The algorithm is also implemented on the SDSS catalogue and used to locat
interesting configurations of the filamentary structure. In this context we
carried the identification of an ``optically faint'' cluster at the

method and corresponding piece of software allows a genuinely scale free and
parameter free identification of the voids, walls, filaments, clusters and
their configuration within the cosmic web, directly from the discrete
distribution of particles in N-body simulations or galaxies in sparse
observational catalogues. To achieve that goal, the method works directly over
the Delaunay tessellation of the discrete sample and uses the DTFE density
computed at each tracer particle; no further sampling, smoothing or processing
of the density field is required.
  The idea is based on recent advances in distinct sub-domains of computational
topology, which allows a rigorous application of topological principles to
astrophysical data sets, taking into account uncertainties and Poisson noise.
Practically, the user can define a given persistence level in terms of
robustness with respect to noise (defined as a ""number of sigmas"") and the
algorithm returns the structures with the corresponding significance as sets of
critical points, lines, surfaces and volumes corresponding to the clusters,
filaments, walls and voids; filaments, connected at cluster nodes, crawling
along the edges of walls bounding the voids. The method is also interesting as
it allows for a robust quantification of the topological properties of a
discrete distribution in terms of Betti numbers or Euler characteristics,
without having to resort to smoothing or having to define a particular scale.

describe the method and implementation, while we address the application to 3D

sigma-models or non-Abelian lattice gauge theories, the method does not
converge in the physically most interesting weak-coupling limit. In this case
one can absorb the divergences into a self-consistent redefinition of expansion
parameters. Stochastic solution of the self-consistency conditions can be

in the back focal plane of the objective lens. For a phase shift of pi/2
between scattered and unscattered electrons induced by a physical phase plate,
the sine-type phase contrast transfer function is converted into a cosine-type
function. Optimal imaging conditions could theoretically be achieved if the
phase shifts caused by the objective lens defocus and lens aberrations would be
equal zero. In reality this situation is difficult to realize because of
residual aberrations and varying, non-zero local defocus values, which in
general result from an uneven sample surface topography. We explore the
conditions - i.e. range of Cs-values and defocus - for most favourable contrast
transfer as a function of the information limit, which is only limited by the
effect of partial coherence of the electron wave in Cs-corrected transmission
electron microscopes. Under high-resolution operation conditions we find that a

are greatly expanded. This paper provides an update of the Sling-on-a-Ring
concept in terms of new materials, potential applications, and trade-offs

associated LEO-Ring systems (e.g., ""Solar-Shade Rings"" and ""Power Rings"") is

indicates the feasibility of near-term implementation of the system (possibly
within the decade). The Sling-on-a-Ring can provide a less-expensive,
environment-friendly, mode of access to space. This would pave the way (via
eventual operation at >1000 tonnes per day by 2050) for large scale development

band and r' band (transformed to the V -band extinction coefficient kV) using
the Carlsberg Meridian Telescope (CMT). Clear seasonal variations that repeat
yearly are observed. The median value of kV is 0.13 mag/airmass; the mean value
has a maximum in the summer months (June- September), corresponding to the
season with maximum frequency of nights affected by dust or cirrus (~29% in

place during the database baseline, which has enabled the study of the impact
of volcanoes on the global atmosphere extinction. For the 5 yr of available

of the two-timing method, the Eulerian averaging procedure, and several novel

independent dimensionless scaling parameters: inverse frequency $1/\omega$ and
displacement amplitude $\delta$; (ii) we propose the \emph{inspection

solutions for $1/\omega\to 0, \delta\to 0$ and leads to the key notions of
\emph{critical, subcritical, and supercritical asymptotic families} of

that there are at least three different drift velocities which correspond to
different asymptotic paths on the plane $(1/\omega,\delta)$; each velocity has
dimensionless magnitude ${O}(1)$; (v) the obtained solutions also show that the
averaged motion of a scalar represents a pure drift for the zeroth and first
approximations and a drift combined with \emph{pseudo-diffusion} for the second
approximation; (vi) we have shown how the changing of a time-scale produces new
classes of solutions; (vii) we develop the two-timing theories of a drift based
on both the \emph{GLM}-theory and the dynamical systems approach; (viii)

values of the hydrogen column densities determined independently from the

is associated with the X-ray source. Since the X-ray luminosity can not be
explained in terms of emission from a single G9-V star, it is likely that CXO

J172337.5-373442 is the nearest known resolved X-ray jet from a binary system,

the compact object can not be confirmed. However the low luminosity of the
X-ray point source, 7.1x10^{30} Lsun combined with estimates of the age of the
jet and a lack of detection of bright outburst, suggests that the X-ray jet was
launched during extreme quiescence of the object. The measured low X-ray

thereby relaxing stresses. On the other hand, application of an electric field
is widely used experimentally to structure thin films: when the electric
Maxwell surface stress overcomes surface tension and elastic restoring forces,
the system undulates with a wavelength determined by the film thickness. We
develop a theory taking into account both mechanisms simultaneously and discuss

of low-energy positrons with molecules with emphasis on resonances, positron
attachment and annihilation. Annihilation rates measured as a function of
positron energy reveal the presence of vibrational Feshbach resonances (VFR)
for many polyatomic molecules. These resonances lead to strong enhancement of
the annihilation rates. They also provide evidence that positrons bind to many
molecular species. A quantitative theory of VFR-mediated attachment to small
molecules is presented. It is tested successfully for selected molecules (e.g.,
methyl halides and methanol) where all modes couple to the positron continuum.
Combination and overtone resonances are observed and their role is elucidated.
In larger molecules, annihilation rates from VFR far exceed those explicable on
the basis of single-mode resonances. These enhancements increase rapidly with
the number of vibrational degrees of freedom. While the details are as yet
unclear, intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution to states that do not
couple directly to the positron continuum appears to be responsible for these
enhanced annihilation rates. Downshifts of the VFR from the vibrational mode
energies have provided binding energies for thirty species. Their dependence
upon molecular parameters and their relationship to positron-atom and
positron-molecule binding energy calculations are discussed. Feshbach
resonances and positron binding to molecules are compared with the analogous
electron-molecule (negative ion) cases. The relationship of VFR-mediated
annihilation to other phenomena such as Doppler-broadening of the gamma-ray
annihilation spectra, annihilation of thermalized positrons in gases, and
annihilation-induced fragmentation of molecules is discussed.

""classical concepts."" In the context of the decoherence program, on the other
hand, it has become fashionable to talk about the ""dynamical emergence of
classicality"" from the quantum formalism alone. Does this mean that decoherence
challenges Bohr's dictum -- for example, that classical concepts do not need to
be assumed but can be derived? In this paper, we'll try to shed some light down
the murky waters where formalism and philosophy mingle. To begin, we'll clarify
the notion of classicality in the decoherence description. We'll then discuss
Bohr's and Heisenberg's takes on the quantum-classical problem and reflect on
the different meanings of the terms ""classicality"" and ""classical concepts"" in
the writings of Bohr and his followers. This analysis will allow us to put
forward some tentative suggestions for how we may better understand the
relation between decoherence-induced classicality and Bohr's classical
concepts.

supergiant H ii region in a nearby galaxy M 33. Our high spatial resolution

that have masses of (0.8 -7.4) 10$^5$M$_{\sun }$ and sizes of 5 -- 29 pc,
comparable to those of typical Galactic giant molecular clouds (GMCs).
Moreover, we detected for the first time HCN emission in the two most massive
clouds and 89 GHz continuum emission at the rims of the ""H${\alpha}$ shells"".
Three out of ten CO clouds are well correlated with the H${\alpha}$ shells both
in spatial and velocity domains, implying an interaction between molecular gas
and the expanding H ii region. Furthermore, we estimated star formation
efficiencies (SFEs) for each cloud from the 89-GHz and combination of
H${\alpha}$ and 24-${\mu}$m data, and found that the SFEs decrease with
increasing projected distance measured from the heart of the central OB star
cluster in NGC 604, suggesting the radial changes in evolutionary stages of the
molecular clouds in course of stellar cluster formation. Our results provide
further support to the picture of sequential star formation in NGC604 initially
proposed by Tosaki et al. (2007) with the higher spatially resolved molecular
clouds, in which an isotropic expansion of the H ii region pushes gases outward
and accumulates them to consecutively form dense molecular clouds, and then
induces massive star formations.

The equation defines a generalized gradient flow for an energy functional that

symmetric decreasing about $x=0$. For $\alpha<1$ there is a critical value for
the mass at which the minimizer has a touchdown zero. If the mass exceeds this
value, the minimizer is strictly positive. Otherwise, it is supported on a
proper subinterval of the domain and meets the dry region at zero contact

nano-hillock of 3-fold symmetry based on AFM and TEM images. First-principle
quantum-mechanical calculations show a substantial variation of electrostatic
potential at the hillock due to the presence of surface features such as edges
and vertexes. Using an implemented Monte Carlo simulated annealing method we
found the orientation of the immobilized protein on the zirconia surface (both
flat and nanostructured) and contribution of the each amino acid residue from
the protein sequence to the adsorption energy. Accounting for the variation of
the dielectric permittivity at the protein-implant interface we use a model
distance-dependent dielectric function to describe the inter-atom electrostatic
(Coulomb) interactions in the adsorption potential. We find that the initial
immobilization of the rigid protein fragment on the nanostructured pyramidal
ZrO2 surface is achieved with magnitude of adsorption energy larger than the
one for the protein on the smooth (flat) surface. The strong attractive
electrostatic interactions are a major factor in the enhanced adsorption at
nanostructured surface that is absent in the case of adsorption on the flat
uncharged surface. We show that the best electrostatic and steric fit of the
protein to the inorganic surface corresponds to a minimum of the adsorption
energy determined by the non-covalent interactions.

All tracers of dark matter evolution are expected to be sensitive to neutrino
masses on this and smaller scales. Here we explore the possibility of using
cluster number counts and power spectrum obtained from ongoing SZ surveys to
constrain neutrino masses. Specifically, we forecast the capability of ongoing
measurements with the PLANCK satellite and the ground-based SPT experiment, as
well as measurements with the proposed EPIC satellite, to set interesting
bounds on neutrino masses from their respective SZ surveys. We also consider an
ACT-like CMB experiment that covers only a few hundred ${\rm deg^{2}}$ also to
explore the tradeoff between the survey area and sensitivity and what effect
this may have on inferred neutrino masses. We find that for such an experiment
a shallow survey is preferable over a deep and low-noise scanning scheme. We
also find that projected results from the PLANCK SZ survey can, in principle,
be used to determine the total neutrino mass with a ($1\sigma$) uncertainty of
$0.28 eV$, if the detection limit of a cluster is set at the $5\sigma$
significance level. This is twice as large as the limits expected from PLANCK
CMB lensing measurements. The corresponding limits from the SPT and EPIC
surveys are $\sim 0.44 eV$ and $\sim 0.12 eV$, respectively. Mapping an area of
200 deg$^{2}$, ACT measurements are predicted to attain a $1\sigma$ uncertainty

provide information about the nature of small scale coronal heating. We expand
on previous work to investigate these properties. We study whether the
predicted statistical distribution of ion emission line intensities produced by
a specified heating function is affected by the isoelectronic sequence to which
the ion belongs, as well as the characteristic temperature at which it was
formed. Particular emphasis is placed on the strong resonance lines belonging
to the lithium isoelectronic sequence. Predictions for emission lines observed
by existing space-based UV spectrometers are given. The effects on the
statistics of a line when observed with a wide-band imaging instrument rather
than a spectrometer are also investigated. We use a hydrodynamic model to
simulate the UV emission of a loop system heated by nanoflares on small,
spatially unresolved scales. We select lines emitted at similar temperatures
but belonging to different isoelectronic groups: Fe IX and Ne VIII, Fe XII and
Mg X, Fe XVII, Fe XIX and Fe XXIV. Our simulations confirm previous results
that almost all lines have an intensity distribution that follows a power-law,
in a similar way to the heating function. However, only the high temperature
lines best preserve the heating function's power law index (Fe XIX being the
best ion in the case presented here). The Li isoelectronic lines have different
statistical properties with respect to the lines from other sequences, due to
the extended high temperature tail of their contribution functions. However,
this is not the case for Fe XXIV which may be used as a diagnostic of the
coronal heating function. We also show that the power-law index of the heating
function is effectively preserved when a line is observed by a wide-band
imaging instrument rather than a spectromenter.

values of the interactions. We show that it is essential to take into account
formally irrelevant terms of order $X$. They generate relevant terms
proportional to $X^2$ in the flow of the renormalization group (RG). These
terms are calculated using operator product expansions. The model shows three
phases separated by a charge transition at $U=U_c$ and a spin transition at
$U=U_s>U_c$. For $U<U_c$ singlet superconducting correlations dominate, while
for $U>U_s$, the system is in the spin-density wave phase as in the usual
Hubbard model. For intermediate values $U_c<U<U_s$, the system is in a
spontaneously dimerized bond-ordered wave phase, which is absent in the
ordinary Hubbard model with $X=0$. We obtain that the charge transition remains
at $U_c=0$ for $X \neq 0$. Solving the RG equations for the spin sector, we
provide an analytical expression for $U_s(X)$. The results, with only one
adjustable parameter, are in excellent agreement with numerical ones for $X <

device (SQUID) position detector on an integrated 1 MHz flexural resonator. The
frequency and quality factor of the micromechanical resonator can be tuned with
bias current and applied magnetic flux. The backaction is caused by the Lorentz
force due to the change in circulating current when the resonator displaces.
The experimental features are reproduced by numerical calculations using the
resistively and capacitively shunted junction (RCSJ) model.

world-sheet fields are periodic, whereas model II represents a particular
orbifold of AdS5 x S5 and model III is a beta-deformed theory. For models I and
II we construct the one-particle TBA equations and use them to determine the
leading finite-size correction to the asymptotic Bethe equation. We also make
some interesting observations concerning the quantization conditions for the
momentum. For the same models we compute the leading and for model II the
next-to-leading order finite-size corrections to the asymptotic magnon
dispersion relation. Furthermore, we apply L\""uscher's formulae to compute the
leading finite-size corrections in beta-deformed theory. In addition to
reproducing known results, we provide new predictions for two-particle states
from the sl(2) sector, to be confronted with explicit field-theoretic
calculations in the dual gauge theory. Finally, we prove that the leading
finite-size correction to the energy of an sl(2) magnon in orbifold theory is
the same as the one for an su(2) magnon in beta-deformed theory for special
values of beta. We also speculate that for these values of beta our result for
the next-to-leading order correction in the orbifold model might coincide with
the corresponding correction to the energy of su(2) magnon in beta-deformed
theory.

  case of M87","17 pages, 8 figures",,,,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A general relativistic model for the formation and acceleration of low
mass-loaded jets from systems containing accreting black holes is presented.
The model is based on previous numerical results and theoretical studies in the
Newtonian regime, but modified to include the effects of space-time curvature
in the vicinity of the event horizon of a spinning black hole. It is argued
that the boundary layer between the Keplerian accretion disk and the event
horizon is best suited for the formation and acceleration of the
accretion-powered jets in active galactic nuclei and micro-quasars.
  The model is based on matching the solutions of three different regions: i- a
weakly magnetized Keplerian accretion disk in the outer part, where the
transport of angular momentum is mediated through the magentorotational
instability, ii- a strongly magnetized, advection-dominated and turbulent-free
boundary layer (BL) between the outer cold accretion disk and the event
horizon, where the plasma rotates sub-Keplerian and iii- a transition zone (TZ)
between the BL and the overlying corona, where the electrons and protons are
thermally uncoupled, highly dissipative and rotate super-Keplerian.
  Our model predicts the known correlation between the Lorentz-factor and the
spin parameter of the BH. It also shows that the effective surface of the BL,
through which the baryons flow into the TZ, shrinks with increasing the spin
parameter, implying therefore that low mass-loaded jets most likely originate
from around Kerr black holes.
  When applying our model to the jet in the elliptical galaxy M87, we find a
spin parameter in the range 0.99 - 0.998, a transition radius of about 30
gravitational radii and a fraction of 0.05 - 0.1 of the mass accretion rate
goes into the TZ, where the plasma speeds up its outward-oriented motion to
reach a Lorentz factor of 2.5 - 5.0 at the transition radius.

  Networks with Limited Tx CSI",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An asymptotic technique is presented for finding the spectral efficiency of
multi-antenna links in wireless networks where transmitters have
Channel-State-Information (CSI) corresponding to their target receiver.
Transmitters are assumed to transmit independent data streams on a limited
number of channel modes which limits the rank of transmit covariance matrices.
This technique is applied to spatially distributed networks to derive an
approximation for the asymptotic spectral efficiency in the
interference-limited regime as a function of link-length, interferer density,
number of antennas per receiver and transmitter, number of transmit streams and
path-loss exponent. It is found that targeted-receiver CSI, which can be
acquired with low overhead in duplex systems with reciprocity, can increase
spectral efficiency several fold, particularly when link lengths are large,
node density is high or both. Additionally, the per-link spectral efficiency is
found to be a function of the ratio of node density to the number of receiver
antennas, and that it can often be improved if nodes transmit using fewer
streams. These results are validated for finite-sized systems by Monte-Carlo
simulation and are asymptotic in the regime where the number of users and
antennas per receiver approach infinity.
