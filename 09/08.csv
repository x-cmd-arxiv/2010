We found that (i) the contribution of short distances to the opacity for
nucleus-nucleus scattering dies at high energies, (ii) the opacity tends to
unity at high energy, and (iii) the main contribution that survives comes from
soft (long distance) processes for large values of the impact parameter. The
corrections to the opacity $\Omega\Lb Y,b\Rb = 1$ were calculated and it turns
out that they have a completely different form, namely($1 - \Omega \to \exp\Lb
- Const\,\sqrt{Y}\Rb$) than the opacity that stems from the Balisky-Kovchegov
equation, which is($1 - \Omega \to \exp\Lb - Const\,Y^2\Rb$). We reproduce the
formula for the nucleus-nucleus cross section that is commonly used in the
description of nucleus-nucleus scattering, and there is no reason why it should

cosmological systems where the characteristic scale of non-linearities is much
smaller than the Hubble scale. By integrating out the short-wavelength modes,
it is possible to obtain an effective theory of long-wavelength perturbations
that is described by an imperfect fluid evolving in an FRW background. As the
long-wavelength perturbations remain small even when the short-scale dynamics
are non-linear, the tools of linear perturbation theory may be applied. The
work in [arXiv:1004.2488] deals only with matter in the form of a pressureless
perfect fluid with zero anisotropic stress, and also assumes that the
short-scale gravitational dynamics are Newtonian. In this work we extend this
formalism to the case of a perfect fluid with pressure, and in particular to
the case of preheating after inflation, where the matter content of the
universe can be modeled by two coupled scalar fields. We discard the assumption
that the short-scale gravitational dynamics are Newtonian. We find that our
results differ from Baumann et al.'s even when the pressure is set to zero,
which suggests that relaxing their assumptions creates appreciable changes in
the long-wavelength effective theory. We derive equations of motion for the
total density perturbation and matter velocities during preheating, as well as
linearized Einstein equations for the long-wavelength metric perturbations. We
also present the equations governing the effective long-wavelength scalar field
dynamics.

cross-links which prescribe a finite angle and treat them as quenched disorder
in a semi-microscopic replica field theory. Starting from a fluid of
un-cross-linked polymers and small polymer clusters (sol) and increasing the
cross-link density, a continuous gelation transition occurs. In the resulting
gel, the semiflexible chains either display long range orientational order or
are frozen in random directions depending on the value of the crossing angle,
the crosslink concentration and the stiffness of the polymers. A crossing angle
$\theta\sim 2\pi/M$ leads to long range $M$-fold orientational order, e.g.,
""hexatic"" or ""tetratic"" for $\theta=60^{\circ}$ or $90^{\circ}$, respectively.
The transition is discontinuous and the critical cross-link density depends on
the bending stiffness of the polymers and the cross-link geometry: the higher
the stiffness and the lower $M$, the lower the critical number of cross-links.
In between the sol and the long range ordered state, we always observe a gel
which is a statistically isotropic amorphous solid (SIAS) with random
positional and random orientational localization of the participating polymers.

imitative. Despite such aspects are widely accepted and empirically confirmed,
the schemes currently exploited in order to generate the expected topology are
based on a-priori assumptions and in most cases still implement constant
intensities for links. Here we propose a simple shift in the definition of
patterns in an Hopfield model to convert frustration into dilution: By varying
the bias of the pattern distribution, the network topology -which is generated
by the reciprocal affinities among agents - crosses various well known regimes
(fully connected, linearly diverging connectivity, extreme dilution scenario,
no network), coupled with small world properties, which, in this context, are
emergent and no longer imposed a-priori. The model is investigated at first
focusing on these topological properties of the emergent network, then its
thermodynamics is analytically solved (at a replica symmetric level) by
extending the double stochastic stability technique, and presented together
with its fluctuation theory for a picture of criticality. At least at
equilibrium, dilution simply decreases the strength of the coupling felt by the
spins, but leaves the paramagnetic/ferromagnetic flavors unchanged. The main
difference with respect to previous investigations and a naive picture is that
within our approach replicas do not appear: instead of (multi)-overlaps as
order parameters, we introduce a class of magnetizations on all the possible
sub-graphs belonging to the main one investigated: As a consequence, for these
objects a closure for a self-consistent relation is achieved.

presentations satisfy a completeness property in the sense of Dehornoy, if the
corresponding graph of the arrangement has no edges. The completeness property
is a powerful property which leads to many nice properties concerning the

Phys",,"10.1118/1.3547724",,"physics.med-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Four-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT) has been widely used in cancer
radiotherapy for accurate target delineation and motion measurement for tumors
in thorax and upper abdomen areas. However, 4DCT simulation is associated with
much higher imaging dose than conventional CT simulation, which is a major
concern in its clinical application. Conventionally, each phase of 4DCT is
reconstructed independently using the filtered backprojection (FBP) algorithm.
The basic idea of our new algorithm is that, by utilizing the common
information among different phases, the input information required to
reconstruct image of high quality, and thus the imaging dose, can be reduced.
We proposed a temporal non-local means (TNLM) method to explore the inter-phase
similarity. All phases of the 4DCT images are reconstructed simultaneously by
minimizing a cost function consisting of a data fidelity term and a TNLM
regularization term. We utilized a forward-backward splitting algorithm and a
Gauss-Jacobi iteration method to efficiently solve the minimization problem.
The algorithm was also implemented on graphics processing unit (GPU) to achieve
a high computational speed. Our reconstruction algorithm has been tested on a
digital NCAT thorax phantom in three low dose scenarios. Our new algorithm
generates visually much better CT images containing less image noise and
streaking artifacts compared with the standard FBP algorithm. Quantitative
analysis shows that much higher contrast-to-noise ratio and signal-to-noise
ratio can be obtained using our algorithm. The total reconstruction time for
all 10 phases of a slice ranges from 90 to 140 seconds on an NVIDIA Tesla C1060
GPU card.

by a perturbing body. The continuous action of tides modify the rotation of the
planet together with its orbit until an equilibrium situation is reached. It is
often believed that synchronous motion is the most probable outcome of the
tidal evolution process, since synchronous rotation is observed for the
majority of the satellites in the Solar System. However, in the 19th century,
Schiaparelli also assumed synchronous motion for the rotations of Mercury and
Venus, and was later shown to be wrong. Rather, for planets in eccentric orbits
synchronous rotation is very unlikely. The rotation period and axial tilt of
exoplanets is still unknown, but a large number of planets have been detected
close to the parent star and should have evolved to a final equilibrium
situation. Therefore, based on the Solar System well studied cases, we can make
some predictions for exoplanets. Here we describe in detail the main tidal
effects that modify the secular evolution of the spin and the orbit of a
planet. We then apply our knowledge acquired from Solar System situations to
exoplanet cases. In particular, we will focus on two classes of planets,
""Hot-Jupiters"" (fluid) and ""Super-Earths"" (rocky with atmosphere).

finite-size scaling to extract the critical point as well as some critical
exponents for the one and two dimensional models. Our results indicate that
such multi-partite measure of global entanglement shows universal features

the specific case of Lipschitz and H\""older functions, the operator norm of the
maximal operator is uniformly bounded by $2^{-\alpha/q}$, where $q$ is the

energy fluctuations. Gravitational energy fluctuations -- gravitons -- are
responsible for elastic scattering of subatomic particles. Such scattering
corresponds to complimentary force -- graviton scattering force -- arising in
gravitational interaction in addition to Newtonian gravity. The strength of the
graviton scattering force is proportional to the graviton scattering
probability. Unlike Newtonian gravity the graviton scattering force follows the
1/r law and dominates the former on cosmological scale in the limit of low
orbital accelerations. Similarly to Modified Newtonian Dynamics the quantum
gravity accounts for variations in observed M/L ratios of diverse stellar
systems ranging from dwarf spheroid galaxies to X-ray galaxy clusters without
requiring an invisible matter (which is still required by MOND in X-Ray cluster
cores). Unlike MOND the presented theory neither violates cornerstone Newton
Laws nor suffers from the ambiguity of acceleration frames while enjoying vast
experimental evidence usually cited in favor of MOND. To ascertain the validity
of the presented theory I have examined the predictions of quantum gravity for
dwarf spheroid, ordinary and giant elliptic galaxies, and X-ray clusters. In
all cases quantum gravity yields M/L ratios and scaling relations consistent
with observations. Quantum gravity accounts for the tilt of the Fundamental
Plane of elliptical galaxies erasing the differences in M/L vs. luminosity
relations for faint and bright ellipticals, which cannot be easily explained by
CDM model. Lastly, by analyzing the behavior of the gravitational energy
fluctuations in the limit of high matter density expected in the early Universe
I show that primordial inflation and dark energy (i.e. non-zero cosmological
constant) arise as natural effects of quantum gravity in the expanding
Universe.

its mass MX is. For example, by assuming for it a solar (MX =M_Sun) or brown
dwarf mass (MX = 80mJup), now at not less than dX = 11-6 kau (1 kau=1000
astronomical units), v would be of the order of 6-10% and 3-5% of the speed of
light c, respectively. By assuming larger present-day distances for X, on the
basis of the lacking of direct observational evidences of electromagnetic
origin for it, its speed would be even higher. Instead, the fastest solitary
massive objects known so far, like hypervelocity stars (HVSs) and supernova
remnants (SRs), travel at v = 0.002-0.005c, having acquired so huge velocities
in some of the most violent astrophysical phenomena like interactions with
supermassive galactic black holes and supernova explosions. It turns out that
the orbit of the Earth would not be macroscopically altered by a close (0.2 au)
passage of such an ultrafast body X in the next 2 yr. On the contrary, our
planet would be hurled into the space if a Sun-sized body X would encounter it
by moving at v/c = 10^-4. On the other hand, this would imply that such a X
should be now at just 20-30 au, contrary to all direct observational and

cosmogenic neutrino flux given recent cosmic ray data and updates on plausible
source evolution models. The shape and normalization of the cosmogenic neutrino
flux are very sensitive to some of the current unknowns of ultrahigh energy
cosmic ray sources and composition. We investigate various chemical
compositions and maximum proton acceleration energies E_p,max which are allowed
by current observations. We consider different models of source evolution in
redshift and three possible scenarios for the Galactic to extragalactic
transition. We summarize the parameter space for cosmogenic neutrinos into
three regions: an optimistic scenario that is currently being constrained by
observations, a plausible range of models in which we base many of our rate
estimates, and a pessimistic scenario that will postpone detection for decades
to come. We present the implications of these three scenarios for the detection
of cosmogenic neutrinos from PeV to ZeV (10^14-21 eV) with the existing and
upcoming instruments. In the plausible range of parameters, the narrow flux
variability in the EeV energy region assures low but detectable rates for
IceCube (0.06-0.2 neutrino per year) and the Pierre Auger Observatory
(0.03-0.06 neutrino per year), and detection should happen in the next decade.
If EeV neutrinos are detected, PeV information can help select between
competing models of cosmic ray composition at the highest energy and the
Galactic to extragalactic transition at ankle energies. With improved
sensitivity, ZeV neutrino observatories, such as ANITA and JEM-EUSO could
explore and place limits on the maximum acceleration energy.

key role in the evolution of gas in groups and clusters of galaxies.
Unequivocal evidence comes from quasi-spherical X-ray cavities observed near
cluster centers having sizes ranging from a few to tens of kpc, some containing
radio emission. Cavities apparently evolve from the interaction of AGN jets
with the intracluster medium (ICM). However, in numerical simulations it has
been difficult to create such fat cavities from narrow jets. Ultra-hot thermal
jets dominated by kinetic energy typically penetrate deep into the ICM, forming
radially elongated cavities at large radii unlike those observed. Here, we
study very light jets dominated energetically by relativistic cosmic rays (CRs)
with axisymmetric hydrodynamic simulations, investigating the jet evolution
both when they are active and when they are later turned off. We find that,
when the thermal gas density in a CR-dominated jet is sufficiently low, the jet
has a correspondingly low inertia, and thus decelerates quickly in the ICM.
Furthermore, CR pressure causes the jet to expand laterally, encounter and
displace more decelerating ICM gas, naturally producing fat cavities near
cluster centers similar to those observed. Our calculations of cavity formation
imply that AGN jets responsible for creating fat X-ray cavities (radio bubbles)
are very light, and dominated by CRs. This scenario is consistent with radio
observations of Fanaroff-Riley I jets that appear to decelerate rapidly,
produce strong synchrotron emission and expand typically at distances of a few
kpc from the central AGN.

data at high redshift. For all explored semi-analytic models this holds at the
redshifts - between 2 and 3 - where the discrepancy was recently pointed out.
The reason for the success is that at these cosmic epochs the model galaxies
have the right age (~1 Gyr) to contain a well-developed TP-AGB phase which
makes them redder without the need of changing their mass or age. At the same
time, the known overestimation of the faint end is enhanced in the K-band when
including the TP-AGB contribution. At lower redshifts (z<2) some of the
explored models deviate from the data. This is due to too short merging
timescales and inefficient 'radio-mode' AGN feedback. Our results show that a
strong evolution in mass predicted by hierarchical models is compatible with no
evolution on the bright-end of the K-band LF from z=3 to the local universe.
This means that, at high redshifts and contrary to what is commonly accepted,
K-band emission is not necessarily a good tracer of galaxy mass.

less efficient than what is seen in local galaxies. Thus, the overall DLA
population seems to originate from the low luminosity end of the high redshift

surveys of stellar clusters. The orbital decay that hot Jupiters suffer may
result in their destruction, leaving fewer transiting planets in older
clusters. We calculate the impact tidal evolution has for different assumed
stellar populations, including that of 47~Tuc, a globular cluster that was the
focus of an intense HST search for transits. We find that in older clusters one
expects to detect fewer transiting planets by a factor of two for surveys
sensitive to Jupiter-like planets in orbits out to 0.5~AU, and up to a factor
of 25 for surveys sensitive to Jupiter-like planets in orbits out to 0.08~AU.
Additionally, tidal evolution affects the distribution of transiting planets as
a function of semi-major axis, producing larger orbital period gaps for
transiting planets as the age of the cluster increases. Tidal evolution can
explain the lack of detected exoplanets in 47~Tuc without invoking other
mechanisms. Four open clusters residing within the {\em Kepler} fields of view
have ages that span 0.4-8~Gyr--if {\em Kepler} can observe a significant number
of planets in these clusters, it will provide key tests for our tidal evolution
hypothesis. Finally, our results suggest that observers wishing to discover
transiting planets in clusters must have sufficient accuracy to detect lower

potential and behaves as dark energy), and apply it to a class of models
specified by an inverse power-law potential and a non-minimal coupling. Our
full solution of the scalar field perturbation confirms that, when the
potential is not too nonlinear, the effects of the scalar field could be
accurately approximated as a modification of background expansion rate plus a
rescaling of the effective gravitational constant relevant for structure
growth. For the models we consider, these have opposite effects, leading to a
weak net effect in the linear perturbation regime. However, on the nonlinear
scales the modified expansion rate dominates and could produce interesting
signatures in the matter power spectrum and mass function, which might be used
to improve the constraints on the models from cosmological data. We show that
the density profiles of the dark matter halos are well described by the
Navarro-Frenk-White formula, although the scalar field could change the
concentration. We also derive an analytic formula for the scalar field
perturbation inside halos assuming NFW density profile and sphericity, which
agrees well with numerical results if the parameter is appropriately tuned. The
results suggest that for the models considered, the spatial variation of the

weak, and so local experiments could see the background variation of

Z_2-even phase, the usual projection-based scheme can be used to build the
Wannier representation. In the Z_2-odd phase, we do find a topological
obstruction, but only if one insists on choosing a gauge that respects the
time-reversal symmetry, corresponding to Wannier functions that come in
time-reversal pairs. If instead we are willing to violate this gauge condition,
a Wannier representation becomes possible. We present an explicit construction
of Wannier functions for the Z_2-odd phase of the Kane-Mele model via a
modified projection scheme followed by maximal localization, and confirm that
these Wannier functions correctly represent the electric polarization and other

the formation of spin density wave (SDW) in a non-magnetic metal with strong

incommensurate magnetic order below 20 K in heavily-overdoped La2-xSrxCuO4

to the localized spins on Cu or doped Fe. Angle-resolved photoemission

example of the long-sought ""itinerant-spin extreme"" of cuprates, where the
spins of itinerant doped holes define the magnetic ordering ground state. This
finding complements the current picture of cuprate spin physics that highlights
the predominant role of localized spins at lower dopings. The demonstrated set

computation of flow in a domain confined by intersecting a liquid-fluid free
surface and a liquid-solid interface, with the three-phase contact line moving
across the solid, is considered. For this class of flows, different finite
element method (FEM) implementations have been proposed in the literature and
these are seen to produce apparently contradictory results. The purpose of this
paper is to develop a robust framework for the FEM simulation of these flows
and then, by performing numerical experiments, provide guidelines for future
investigations. In the new framework, the boundary conditions on the
liquid-solid interface are implemented in a methodologically similar way to
those on the free surface so that the equations at the contact line, where the
interfaces meet, are applied without any ad-hoc alterations. The new
implementation removes the need for complex rotations of the momentum
equations, usually required to apply boundary conditions normal and tangent to
the solid surface. The developed code allows the convergence of the solution to
be studied as the spatial resolution of the computational mesh is varied over
many orders of magnitude. This makes it possible to provide practical
recommendations on the spatial resolution required by a numerical scheme for a
given set of non-dimensional similarity parameters. Furthermore, one can
examine various implementations used in the literature and evaluate their
performance. Finally, it is shown how the framework may be generalized to
account for additional physical effects, such as gradients in surface tensions.
A user-friendly step-by-step guide specifying the entire implementation and
allowing the reader to easily reproduce all presented results is provided in

optical and near-infrared photometry. Luminosity functions in the z, H, and Ks
bands show a faint-end slope consistent with being flat, and a characteristic
magnitude M* close to passive evolution predictions of M* of local massive
clusters, with a formation redshift z>2. The color-magnitude and color-mass
diagrams show evidence of a tight red sequence of massive galaxies, with
overall old stellar populations, generally early-type morphology, typically
showing early-type spectral features and rest-frame far-UV emission consistent
with very low star formation rates (SFR<0.2Msun/yr). Star forming spectroscopic
members, with SFRs of up to ~100Msun/yr, are all located at clustercentric
distances >~250kpc, with the central cluster region already appearing
effectively quenched. Massive galaxies in the core of this cluster appear to be
in an advanced evolutionary stage in terms of both star formation and mass
assembly. The high-mass end of the galaxy stellar mass function is essentially
already in place, and the stellar mass fraction estimated within r500 (~1%,
Kroupa IMF) is already similar to that of local massive clusters. On the other
hand, morphological analysis of the massive red sequence galaxies suggests that
they are smaller than similarly massive local early-types. While possibly
affected by systematics and biases, this result might imply that, in spite of
the overall early assembly of these sources, their evolution is not complete,
and processes like minor (and likely dry) merging might still shape their
structural properties to resemble those of their local counterparts, without
substantially affecting their stellar mass or host stellar
populations.[abridged]

shallower as M increases and the same is true for the column density power

turbulent compressions, thermal instability
  generated density fluctuations, and the weakening of thermal pressure force
in diffuse gas. This behavior is consistent with the fact that observationally
determined spectra exhibit different slopes in different regions. The values of
the spectral indexes resulting from our simulations are consistent with
observational values. We do also explore the behavior of the velocity power

090510. We study the origin of this long-lived high-energy emission, using
broad-band observations including X-ray and optical data. We confirm that the
late > 100 MeV, X-ray and optical emission can be naturally explained via
synchrotron emission from an adiabatic forward shock propagating into a
homogeneous ambient medium with low number density. The Klein-Nishina effects
are found to be significant, and effects due to jet spreading and magnetic
field amplification in the shock appear to be required. Under the constraints
from the low-energy observations, the adiabatic forward shock synchrotron
emission is consistent with the later-time (t>2s) high-energy emission, but
falls below the early-time (t < 2s) high energy emission. Thus we argue that an
extra high energy component is needed at early times. A standard reverse shock
origin is found to be inconsistent with this extra component. Therefore, we
attribute the early part of the high-energy emission (t< 2s) to the prompt
component, and the long-lived high energy emission (t>2s) to the adiabatic
forward shock synchrotron afterglow radiation. This avoids the requirement for
an extremely high initial Lorentz factor.

carbon-oxygen white dwarf accretes material from a He main-sequence star or a
He subgiant to increase its mass to the Chandrasekhar mass. We mapped out the
initial parameters for producing SNe Ia in the orbital period--secondary mass

with short delay times (~100Myr) implied by recent observations. We obtained
many properties of the surviving companions of this channel after SN explosion,
which can be verified by future observations. We also find that the surviving
companions from the SN explosion scenario have a high spatial velocity
(>400km/s), which could be an alternative origin for hypervelocity stars

is done by linking the covering and quantizer problems to certain optimization
problems involving the ""void"" nearest-neighbor functions that arise in the
theory of random media and statistical mechanics. These reformulations, which
again exemplifies the deep interplay between geometry and physics, allow one
now to employ theoretical and numerical optimization techniques to analyze and

that disordered saturated sphere packings provide relatively thin (economical)
coverings and may yield thinner coverings than the best known lattice coverings
in sufficiently large dimensions. In the case of the quantizer problem, we
derive improved upper bounds on the quantizer error using sphere-packing

heteroscedastic noise also given by a polynomial or rational weight function.
The proposed method treats D-, E-, A-, and $\Phi_p$-optimal designs in a
unified manner, and generates a polynomial whose zeros are the support points
of the optimal approximate design, generalizing a number of previously known
results of the same flavor. The method is based on a mathematical optimization
model that can incorporate various criteria of optimality and can be solved
efficiently by well established numerical optimization methods. In contrast to
previous optimization-based methods proposed for similar design problems, it
also has theoretical guarantee of its algorithmic efficiency; in fact, the
running times of all numerical examples considered in the paper are negligible.
The stability of the method is demonstrated in an example involving high degree
polynomials. After discussing linear models, applications for finding locally
optimal designs for nonlinear regression models involving rational functions
are presented, then extensions to robust regression designs, and trigonometric
regression are shown. As a corollary, an upper bound on the size of the support
set of the minimally-supported optimal designs is also found. The method is of
considerable practical importance, with the potential for instance to impact
design software development. Further study of the optimality conditions of the
main optimization model might also yield new theoretical insights.

a novel experimental design for comparing market structures in live trading

same trading population. Participants trade on outcomes related to a
two-dimensional random walk that they observe on their computer screens. They
can simultaneously trade in two markets, corresponding to the independent
horizontal and vertical random walks. We use this experimental design to
compare the popular inventory-based logarithmic market scoring rule (LMSR)
market maker and a new information based Bayesian market maker (BMM). Our
experiments reveal that BMM can offer significant benefits in terms of price
stability and expected loss when controlling for liquidity; the caveat is that,
unlike LMSR, BMM does not guarantee bounded loss. Our investigation also
elucidates some general properties of market makers in prediction markets. In
particular, there is an inherent tradeoff between adaptability to market shocks
and convergence during market equilibrium.

either neighboring layer is a BaO layer. Due to the resulting enhancement of
the ferroelectric instability in the BaO-neighboring octahedra, we find that
overall the ferroelectric instability of the superlattice is enhanced by the

the planetary caustic despite the higher probability of planet detection
relative to the central caustic which has been responsible for four extrasolar
planet detections. This is because the perturbations induced by the planetary
caustic are unpredictable, thus making it difficult to carry out strategic
observations. However, if future high-cadence monitoring surveys are conducted,
the majority of planetary caustic events including the events by free-floating
planets and wide-separation planets would be detected. Hence, understanding the
planetary caustic perturbations becomes important. In this paper, we
investigate in detail the pattern of the planetary caustic perturbations. From
this study, we find three properties of the planetary caustic perturbations.
First, planetary systems with the same star-planet separation (s) basically
produce perturbations of constant strength regardless of the planet/star mass
ratio (q), but the duration of each perturbation scales with sqrt{q}. Second,
close planetary systems with the same separation produce essentially the same
negative perturbations between two triangular-shaped caustics regardless of q,
but the duration of the perturbations scales with sqrt{q}. Third, the positive
perturbations for planetary systems with the same mass ratio become stronger as
the caustic shrinks with the increasing |log s|, while the negative
perturbations become weaker. We estimate the degeneracy in the determination of
q that occurs in planetary caustic events. From this, we find that the mass
ratio can be more precisely determined as q increases and |log s| decreases. We
also find that the degeneracy range of events for which the source star passes
close to the planetary caustic is usually very narrow, and thus it would not
significantly affect the determination of q.

and $\sim$91 mJy at 880 $\mu$m) submillimeter galaxy (SMG),
AzTEC-ASTE-SXDF1100.001 (hereafter referred to as SXDF1100.001 or Orochi),
discovered in 1100 $\mu$m observations of the Subaru/XMM-Newton Deep Field
using AzTEC on ASTE. Subsequent CARMA 1300 $\mu$m and SMA 880 $\mu$m
observations successfully pinpoint the location of Orochi and suggest that it
has two components, one extended (FWHM of $\sim$ 4$^{\prime\prime}$) and one
compact (unresolved). Z-Spec on CSO has also been used to obtain a wide band
spectrum from 190 to 308 GHz, although no significant emission/absorption lines
are found. The derived upper limit to the line-to-continuum flux ratio is
0.1--0.3 (2 $\sigma$) across the Z-Spec band.
  Based on the analysis of the derived spectral energy distribution from
optical to radio wavelengths of possible counterparts near the SMA/CARMA peak
position, we suggest that Orochi is a lensed, optically dark SMG lying at $z
\sim 3.4$ behind a foreground, optically visible (but red) galaxy at $z \sim
1.4$. The deduced apparent (i.e., no correction for magnification) infrared
luminosity ($L_{\rm IR}$) and star formation rate (SFR) are $6 \times 10^{13}$
$L_{\odot}$ and 11000 $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, respectively, assuming that the
$L_{\rm IR}$ is dominated by star formation. These values suggest that Orochi
will consume its gas reservoir within a short time scale ($3 \times 10^{7}$
yr), which is indeed comparable to those in extreme starbursts like the centres
of local ULIRGs.

active transmitters per unit area, given an outage constraint at each receiver
for a fixed rate of transmission. Most prior work on finding the transmission
capacity of ad-hoc networks has focused only on one-way communication where a
source communicates with a destination and no data is sent from the destination
to the source. In practice, however, two-way or bidirectional data transmission
is required to support control functions like packet acknowledgements and
channel feedback. This paper extends the concept of transmission capacity to
two-way wireless ad-hoc networks by incorporating the concept of a two-way
outage with different rate requirements in both directions. Tight upper and
lower bounds on the two-way transmission capacity are derived for frequency
division duplexing. The derived bounds are used to derive the optimal solution
for bidirectional bandwidth allocation that maximizes the two-way transmission
capacity, which is shown to perform better than allocating bandwidth
proportional to the desired rate in both directions. Using the proposed two-way
transmission capacity framework, a lower bound on the two-way transmission
capacity with transmit beamforming using limited feedback is derived as a
function of bandwidth, and bits allocated for feedback.

The first method is fully Bayesian in which a prior distribution is placed on

of restricted maximum likelihood. We review the two score-based metrics, then
study their performance by measuring the Kullback Leibler divergence, or
distance, between the two resulting posterior density functions. The Kullback
Leibler divergence provides a natural framework for comparing distributions.
The residual approach is considerably simpler to apply in practice and we
demonstrate its utility both theoretically and via simulations. In particular,
in applications where the exogenous variables are not of primary interest, we
show that the potential loss of information about parameters and induced
components of correlation, is generally small.

solution to the non-linear equation, and how impact parameter dependence
influences the inclusive production. Answering the first question we solve the
modified BK equation which takes into account energy conservation. In spite of
the fact that we used the simplified kernel, we believe that the main result of
the paper: the small ($\leq 40%$) suppression of the inclusive productiondue to
energy conservation, reflects a general feature. This result leads us to
believe that the small value of the nuclear modification factor is of a
non-perturbative nature. In the solution a new scale appears $Q_{fr} = Q_s
\exp(-1/(2 \bas))$ and the production of dipoles with the size larger than
$2/Q_{fr}$ is suppressed. Therefore, we can expect that the typical temperature
for hadron production is about $Q_{fr}$ ($ T \approx Q_{fr}$). The simplified
equation allows us to obtain a solution to Balitsky-Kovchegov equation taking
into account the impact parameter dependence. We show that the impact parameter
($b$) dependence can be absorbed into the non-perturbative $b$ dependence of
the saturation scale. The solution of the BK equation, as well as of the
modified BK equation without $b$ dependence, is only accurate up to $\pm 25%$.

clearly show that quasar image A is affected by strong microlensing variations
and that the time delays are best expressed relative to quasar image B. We
measured Delta_t(BC) = 7.8+/-0.8 days, Delta_t(BD) = -6.5+/-0.7 days and
Delta_t_CD = -14.3+/-0.8 days. We spacially deconvolved HST NICMOS2 F160W
images to derive accurate astrometry of the quasar images and to infer the
light profile of the lensing galaxy. We combined these images with a stellar
population fitting of a deep VLT spectrum of the lensing galaxy to estimate the
baryonic fraction, $f_b$, in the Einstein radius. We measured f_b =
0.65+0.13-0.10 if the lensing galaxy has a Salpeter IMF and f_b =
0.45+0.04-0.07 if it has a Kroupa IMF. The spectrum also allowed us to estimate
the velocity dispersion of the lensing galaxy, sigma_ap = 222+/-34 km/s. We
used f_b and sigma_ap to constrain an analytical model of the lensing galaxy
composed of an Hernquist plus generalized NFW profile. We solve the Jeans
equations numerically for the model and explored the parameter space under the
additional requirement that the model must predict the correct astrometry for
the quasar images. Given the current error bars on f_b and sigma_ap, we did not
constrain H0 yet with high accuracy, i.e., we found a broad range of models
with chi^2 < 1. However, narrowing this range is possible, provided a better
velocity dispersion measurement becomes available. In addition, increasing the
depth of the current HST imaging data of HE 0435-1223 will allow us to combine

characterized by the rattling of monomers or particles in the cage formed by
their neighbors. Recently, a direct correlation in such systems, described by a
universal scaling form, has been established between the rattling amplitude and
the structural relaxation time. In this paper we analyze the glassy dynamics
emerging from the formation of a persistent network in a model colloidal gel at
very low density. The structural relaxation time of the gel network is compared
with the mean squared displacement at short times, corresponding to the
localization length associated to the presence of energetic bonds.
Interestingly, we find that the same type of scaling as for the dense glassy
systems holds. Our findings well elucidate the strong coupling between the
cooperative rearrangements of the gel network and the single particle
localization in the structure. Our results further indicate that the scaling
captures indeed fundamental physical elements of glassy dynamics.

different fields. For example, they are used as reference for the automatic
determination of atmospheric parameters, or for building synthetic stellar
populations to study galaxies. The CFLIB (Coude-feed library, Indo-US) database
is at present one of the most complete libraries, in terms of its coverage of
the atmospheric parameters space (Teff, log g and [Fe/H]) and wavelength
coverage 3460 - 9464 A at a resolution of 1 A FWHM. Although the atmospheric
parameters of most of the stars were determined from detailed analyses of
high-resolution spectra, for nearly 300 of the 1273 stars of the library at
least one of the three parameters is missing. For the others, the measurements,
compiled from the literature, are inhomogeneous.
  Aims: In this paper, we re-determine the atmospheric parameters, directly
using the CFLIB spectra, and compare them to the previous studies.
  Methods: We use the ULySS program to derive the atmospheric parameters, using
the ELODIE library as a reference.
  Results: Based on comparisons with several previous studies we conclude that
our determinations are unbiased. For the 958 F,G, and K type stars the
precision on Teff, log g, and [Fe/H] is respectively 43 K, 0.13 dex and 0.05
dex. For the 53 M stars they are 82 K, 0.22 dex and 0.28 dex. And, for the 260
OBA type stars the relative precision on Teff is 5.1%, and on log g, and [Fe/H]
the precision is respectively 0.19 dex and 0.16 dex. These parameters will be
used to re-calibrate the CFLIB fluxes and to produce synthetic spectra of
stellar populations.

that the fixed points found are in fact spurious. In two dimensions, we find,
as in the O(N) case, that there is apparent convergence of the critical

removing a source, however, it is necessary to detect it and source extraction
consists of a delicate preliminary operation. In the literature, various
techniques have been presented to detect point-sources in the sky maps. The
most sophisticated ones exploit the multi-frequency nature of the observations
that is typical of the CMB experiments. These techniques have ""optimal""
theoretical properties and, at least in principle, are capable of remarkable

the quality of the obtainable results. In this paper, we present a new

hence more robust in practical applications. Such technique shows particular
efficiency in the detection of sources whose spectra have a slope different
from zero. We apply this method to three Southern Hemisphere sky regions - each
with an area of 400 square degrees - of the seven years Wilkinson Microwave
Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) maps and compare the resulting sources with those of
the two seven-year WMAP point-sources catalogues. In these selected regions we
find seven additional sources not previously listed in WMAP catalogues and

$\chi_{min}^2=591.156$. The corresponding age of the universe agrees with the
result of D. Spergel {\it et al.}\cite{Spergel2003} at 95% confidence level.

present paper, a cluster-cluster aggregation model with stochastic particle
replication and chemotactically driven motility is investigated as a model for
the growth of animal cells in culture. The focus is on the scaling laws
governing the aggregation kinetics. Our simulations reveal that in the absence
of chemotaxy the mean cluster size and the total number of clusters scale in
time as stretched exponentials dependent on the particle replication rate.
Also, the dynamical cluster size distribution functions are represented by a
scaling relation in which the scaling function involves a stretched exponential
of the time. The introduction of chemoattraction among the particles leads to
distribution functions decaying as power laws with exponents that decrease in
time. The fractal dimensions and size distributions of the simulated clusters
are qualitatively discussed in terms of those determined experimentally for
several normal and tumoral cell lines growing in culture. It is shown that
particle replication and chemotaxy account for the simplest cluster size
distributions of cellular aggregates observed in culture.

linearly stable (all orbits of the linearized system are bounded) and no motion
is asymptotic in the past, namely no non-constant solution has the equilibrium
as limit point as time goes to minus infinity. In the unstable cases, there is
a sequence of initial data which converges to the equilibrium point whose
corresponding solutions are unbounded and the motion is slow. So instability is
quite weak and perhaps no such explicit examples of instability are known in
the literature. The stable cases are also interesting since the level sets of
the 2 first integrals independent and in involution keep being non-compact and
stability is related to the isochronous periodicity of all orbits near the
equilibrium point and the existence of a further first integral. Hopefully,
these superintegrable Hamiltonian systems will deserve further research.

asteroid belt to constrain the evolution of the giant planets when they
migrated from their primordial orbits to their current ones. Minton & Malhotra
(2009) showed that the orbital distribution of large asteroids in the main belt
can be reproduced by an exponentially-decaying migration of the giant planets
on a time scale of tau ~ 0.5My. However, self-consistent numerical simulations
show that the planetesimal-driven migration of the giant planets is
inconsistent with an exponential change in their semi major axes on such a
short time scale (Hahn & Malhotra, 1999). In fact, the typical time scale is
tau > 5My. When giant planet migration on this time scale is applied to the
asteroid belt, the resulting orbital distribution is incompatible with the
observed one. However, the planet migration can be significantly sped up by
planet-planet encounters. Consider an evolution where both Jupiter and Saturn
have close encounters with a Neptune-mass planet (presumably Uranus or Neptune
themselves) and where this third planet, after being scattered inwards by
Saturn, is scattered outwards by Jupiter. This scenario leads to a very rapid
increase in the orbital separation between Jupiter and Saturn that we show here
to have only mild effects on the structure of asteroid belt. This type of
evolution is called a jumping-Jupiter case. Our results suggest that the total
mass and dynamical excitation of the asteroid belt before migration were
comparable to those currently observed. Moreover, they imply that, before
migration, the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn were much less eccentric than the
current ones.

The tails have slightly larger masses than the heads, and comparable or

is ram pressure interaction between a gas-rich galaxy and a diffuse

also strip away gas from a galaxy and put it into a tail, which then forms new
stars and gravitationally drags along old stars with it. Such an effect might

rather than a random one, can improve the performance of compressed sensing. In
particular, a well-designed sensing matrix can reduce the coherence between the
atoms of the equivalent dictionary, and as a consequence, reduce the
reconstruction error. In some applications, the signals of interest can be well
approximated by a union of a small number of subspaces (e.g., face recognition
and motion segmentation). This implies the existence of a dictionary which
leads to block-sparse representations. In this work, we propose a framework for
sensing matrix design that improves the ability of block-sparse approximation
techniques to reconstruct and classify signals. This method is based on
minimizing a weighted sum of the inter-block coherence and the sub-block
coherence of the equivalent dictionary. Our experiments show that the proposed

hadronic bound states are accessible via covariant integral equations, e.g. the
Bethe-Salpeter equations for mesons. In particular, one has to deal with
linear, homogeneous integral equations which, in sophisticated model setups,
use numerical representations of the solutions of other integral equations as
part of their input. Analogously, inhomogeneous equations can be constructed to
obtain off-shell information in addition to bound-state masses and other
properties obtained from the covariant analogue to a wave function of the bound
state. These can be solved very efficiently using well-known matrix algorithms
for eigenvalues (in the homogeneous case) and the solution of linear systems
(in the inhomogeneous case). We demonstrate this by solving the homogeneous and
inhomogeneous Bethe-Salpeter equations and find, e.g. that for the calculation
of the mass spectrum it is more efficient to use the inhomogeneous equation.
This is valuable insight, in particular for the study of baryons in a
three-quark setup and more involved systems.

where $i_t$'s are thought of as IDs of users. Informally, a randomized function
$f$ is {\em differentially private} with respect to the IDs if the probability
distribution induced by $f$ is not much different from that induced by it on an
input in which occurrences of an ID $j$ are replaced with some other ID $k$
Recently, this notion was extended to {\em pan-privacy} where the computation
of $f$ retains differential privacy, even if the internal memory of the
algorithm is exposed to the adversary (say by a malicious break-in or by fiat
by the government). This is a strong notion of privacy, and surprisingly, for
basic counting tasks such as distinct counts, heavy hitters and others, Dwork
et al~\cite{dwork-pan} present pan-private algorithms with reasonable accuracy.
The pan-private algorithms are nontrivial, and rely on sampling. We reexamine
these basic counting tasks and show improved bounds. In particular, we estimate
the distinct count $\Dt$ to within $(1\pm \eps)\Dt \pm O(\polylog m)$, where
$m$ is the number of elements in the universe. This uses suitably noisy
statistics on sketches known in the streaming literature. We also present the
first known lower bounds for pan-privacy with respect to a single intrusion.
Our lower bounds show that, even if allowed to work with unbounded memory,
pan-private algorithms for distinct counts can not be significantly more
accurate than our algorithms. Our lower bound uses noisy decoding. For heavy
hitter counts, we present a pan private streaming algorithm that is accurate to
within $O(k)$ in worst case; previously known bound for this problem is
arbitrarily worse. An interesting aspect of our pan-private algorithms is that,
they deliberately use very small (polylogarithmic) space and tend to be
streaming algorithms, even though using more space is not forbidden.

of the dark-matter (DM) fraction of the lens galaxies. We present new redshift
of the strong lens candidates. The lens environment is characterized by the
projected 10 closest galaxies around each lens and by the number of galaxies
with a projected distance less than 1Mpc at the lens galaxy redshift. In both
cases, we perform similar measurements on a control sample of twin non-lens
early type galaxies (ETGs). In addition, we identify group members and field
galaxies in the X-ray and optical catalogs of galaxy groups. From those
catalogs, we measure the external shear contribution at the lens galaxy
positions. The systems are then modeled using a SIE plus the external shear due
to the groups. We observe that the average stellar mass of lens galaxies
increases with z and that the environment of lens galaxies is compatible with
that of the twins. During the lens modeling, we notice that, when let free, the
external shear points in a direction which is the mean direction of the
external shear due to groups and of the closest galaxy to the lens. We notice
that the DM fraction of the lens galaxies within the Einstein radius decreases
as the redshift increases. Given these, we conclude that, while the environment
of lens galaxies is compatible with that of non-lens ETGS, their mass
properties evolves significantly with redshift: it is still not clear whether
this advocates in favor of a stronger lensing bias toward massive objects at
high redshift or is simply representative of the high proportion of massive and
high stellar density galaxies at high redshift.

exponentially with the number of subsystems, and the number of invariants

entanglement via local unitary invariants seem very daunting. I point out here
that there is a simplifying principle: Invariants fall into families related by
the tracing-out of subsystems, and these families grow exponentially with the
number of subsystems. In particular, in the case of pure qubit systems, there
is a family whose size is about half the dimension of orbit space. These
invariants are closely related to cumulants and to multipartite separability.
Members of the family have been repeatedly discovered in the literature, but
the fact that they are related to cumulants and constitute a family has

classes later than M7) have emerged from a number of radio observations. The
highly (up to 100%) circularly polarized nature and high brightness temperature
of the emission has been interpreted as an effective amplification mechanism of
the high-frequency electromagnetic waves, the electron cyclotron maser
instability (ECMI). In order to understand the magnetic topology and the
properties of the radio emitting region and associated plasmas in these
ultracool dwarfs and interpret the origin of radio pulses and their radiation
mechanism, we built an active region model, based on the rotation of the UCD
and the ECMI mechanism. ECMI mechanism is responsible for the radio bursts from
the magnetic tubes and the rotation of the dwarf can modulate the integral of
flux with respect to time. The high degree of variability in the brightness and
the diverse profile of pulses can be interpreted in terms of a large-scale hot
active region with extended magnetic structure existing in the magnetosphere of
TVLM 513-46546. We suggest the time profile of the radio light curve is in the
form of power law in the model. The radio emitting region consists of
complicated substructure. With this model, we can determine the nature (e.g.
size, temperature, density) of the radio emitting region and plasma. The
magnetic topology can also be constrained. We compare our predicted X-ray flux
with Chandra X-ray observation of TVLM 513-46546. Although the X-ray detection
is only marginally significant, our predicted flux is significantly lower than
the observed flux. We suggest more observations at multi-wavelength will help
us understand the magnetic field structure and plasma behavior on the ultracool

investigate to what extent we can use this to decrease the variance on
${\fnl}$. We show that the variance can be decreased by up to $20\%$ at Planck

calculated in the presence of a magnetic island in tokamak plasmas. Modes with
the same helicity of the magnetic island are considered in a slab model
approximation. In this framework, with an appropriate rotation of the
coordinates the problem reduces to 2 dimensions. Geometrical effects due to the
shape of the flux surface's cross section are retained to all orders. On the
other hand, we keep only curvature effects responsible of the beta induced gap
in the low-frequency part of the continuous spectrum. New continuum
accumulation points are found at the O-point of the magnetic island. The
beta-induced Alfven Eigenmodes (BAE) continuum accumulation point is found to
be positioned at the separatrix flux surface. The most remarkable result is the
nonlinear modification of the BAE continuum accumulation point frequency.

traditional complication the difficulty in establishing cluster membership of

redshifts involves long exposure times when it is needed to reach the cluster
peripherical regions of/or clusters at moderately large redshifts, while
photometric redshifts often present uncertainties too large to offer
significant conclusions. The mapping of the cluster of galaxies with narrow
band tunable filters makes it possible to reach large redshifts intervals with
an accuracy high enough to establish the source membership of those presenting
emission/absorption lines easily identifiable, as H alpha. Moreover, the
wavelength scan can include other lines as [NII], [OIII] or $H_{\beta}$
allowing to distinguish those sources with strong stellar formation activity
and those with an active galactic nuclei. All this makes it possible to
estimate the stellar formation rate of the galaxies observed. This, together
with ancillary data in other wavelengths may lead to a good estimation of the
stellar formation histories. It will shed new light over the galaxy evolution
in clusters and will improve our understanding of galaxy evolution, especially
in the outer cluster regions, usually less studied and with significant
unexploited data that can not be correctly interpreted without redshift
determination.

ground state transitions of ortho-ammonia and ortho-water, including their 15N,
18O, and 17O isotopologues, towards Sgr B2. The extensive simultaneous velocity
coverage of the observations, >500 km/s, ensures that we can probe the
conditions of both the warm, dense gas of the molecular cloud Sgr B2 near the
Galactic centre, and the more diffuse gas in the Galactic disk clouds along the
line-of-sight. We present ground-state NH3 absorption in seven distinct
velocity features along the line-of-sight towards Sgr B2. We find a nearly
linear correlation between the column densities of NH3 and CS, and a
square-root relation to N2H+. The ammonia abundance in these diffuse Galactic
disk clouds is estimated to be about (0.5-1)e-8, similar to that observed for
diffuse clouds in the outer Galaxy. On the basis of the detection of H218O
absorption in the 3 kpc arm, and the absence of such a feature in the H217O
spectrum, we conclude that the water abundance is around 1e-7, compared to
~1e-8 for NH3. The Sgr B2 molecular cloud itself is seen in absorption in NH3,
15NH3, H2O, H218O, and H217O, with emission superimposed on the absorption in
the main isotopologues. The non-LTE excitation of NH3 in the environment of Sgr
B2 can be explained without invoking an unusually hot (500 K) molecular layer.
A hot layer is similarly not required to explain the line profiles of the
1_{1,0}-1_{0,1} transition from H2O and its isotopologues. The relatively weak
15NH3 absorption in the Sgr B2 molecular cloud indicates a high [14N/15N]
isotopic ratio >600. The abundance ratio of H218O and H217O is found to be
relatively low, 2.5--3. These results together indicate that the dominant
nucleosynthesis process in the Galactic centre is CNO hydrogen burning.

removed, any prior, including the forecast from the data assimilation cycle can
be used. Then we show how to transform this result into EOF space, when a
truncated EOF series has been used in the retrieval process. This provides a
degree of data compression and eliminates those transformed variables that have
very small information content. In both approaches a vertical interpolation
from the dynamical model coordinate to the radiative transfer coordinate is
required. We define an algorithm using the EOF representation to optimize this

out that the quantum features and intensity of the cavity radiation are
considerably modified by the phase fluctuation arising due to the practical
incapability of preparing atoms in the intended coherent superposition. New
terms having an opposite sign with the contribution of the driving radiation
emerged in the master equation. This can be taken as an indication for a
competing effect between the two in the manifestation of the nonclassical

the quantum properties that might have lost due to faulty preparation by
engineering the driving mechanism and vice versa. In light of this, quite
remarkably, the cavity radiation is shown to exhibit nonclassical features
