covering maps $f$ of 2-spheres $S^2$ with a finite set $\mathop{post}(f)$ of

$\varrho$. For example, we will see that an expanding Thurston map is
topologically conjugate to a rational map if and only if $(S^2, \varrho)$ is

complex sequence is a sequence that does not contain substrings of Kolmogorov
complexity less than $\alpha n-O(1)$ where $n$ is the length of substring and
$\alpha$ is a constant between 0 and 1.
  First, we prove that no randomized algorithm can produce everywhere complex
sequence with positive probability.
  On the other hand, for weaker notions of everywhere complex sequences the
situation is different. For example, there is a probabilistic algorithm that
produces (with probability~1) sequences whose substrings of length $n$ have
complexity $\sqrt{n}-O(1)$.
  Finally, one may replace the complexity of a substring (in the definition of
everywhere complex sequence) by its conditional complexity when the position is
given. This gives a stronger notion of everywhere complex sequence, and no
randomized algorighm can produce (with positive probability) such a sequence

structures in the mid-to-high frequency regime is a difficult task. In
particular, structures with large variation of local wavelengths and/or
characteristic scales pose a challenge referred to as the mid-frequency
problem. Standard numerical methods such as the finite element method (FEM)
scale with the local wavelength and quickly become too large even for modern
computer architectures. High frequency techniques, such as statistical energy
analysis (SEA), often miss important information such as dominant resonance
behaviour due to stiff or small scale parts of the structure. Hybrid methods
circumvent this problem by coupling FEM/BEM and SEA models in a given built-up
structure. In the approach adopted here, the whole system is split into a
number of subsystems which are treated by either FEM or SEA depending on the
local wavelength. Subsystems with relative long wavelengths are modelled using
FEM. Making a diffuse field assumption for the wave fields in the short wave
length components, the coupling between subsystems can be reduced to a weighted
random field correlation function. The approach presented results in an
SEA-like set of linear equations which can be solved for the mean energies in
the short wavelength subsystems.

white dwarf accretes from a helium-rich companion and explodes as a SN Ia
before reaching the Chandrasekhar mass limit. We find that using a common
envelope parameterization employing energy balance with alpha=1 and lambda=1,
the supernova rates per unit mass (born in stars) of sub-Chandrasekhar mass SNe
Ia exceed those of all other progenitor channels at epochs t=0.7 - 4 Gyr for a
burst of star formation at t=0. Additionally, the delay time distribution of
the sub-Chandrasekhar model can be divided in to two distinct evolutionary
channels: the `prompt' helium-star channel with delay times < 500 Myr, and the
`delayed' double white dwarf channel with delay times > 800 Myr spanning up to
a Hubble time. These findings are in agreement with recent
observationally-derived delay time distributions which predict that a large
number of SNe Ia have delay times < 1 Gyr, with a significant fraction having
delay times < 500 Myr. We find that the DDS channel is also able to account for
the observed rates of SNe Ia. However, detailed simulations of white dwarf
mergers have shown that most of these mergers will not lead to SNe Ia but
rather to the formation of a neutron star via accretion-induced collapse. If
this is true, our standard population synthesis model predicts that the only
progenitor channel which can account for the rates of SNe Ia is the
sub-Chandrasekhar mass scenario, and none of the other progenitors considered

decompositions of a signal for analysis or transmission, while also promoting
sparse expansions. However, when the signal dimension is large, the computation
of the frame measurements of a signal typically requires a large number of
additions and multiplications, and this makes a frame decomposition intractable
in applications with limited computing budget. To address this problem, in this
paper, we focus on frames in finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces and introduce
sparsity for such frames as a new paradigm. In our terminology, a sparse frame
is a frame whose elements have a sparse representation in an orthonormal basis,
thereby enabling low-complexity frame decompositions. To introduce a precise
meaning of optimality, we take the sum of the numbers of vectors needed of this
orthonormal basis when expanding each frame vector as sparsity measure. We then
analyze the recently introduced algorithm Spectral Tetris for construction of
unit norm tight frames and prove that the tight frames generated by this
algorithm are in fact optimally sparse with respect to the standard unit vector
basis. Finally, we show that even the generalization of Spectral Tetris for the
construction of unit norm frames associated with a given frame operator
produces optimally sparse frames.

Current scientific middleware cache systems, however, assume repositories are

queries, instead, are routed to the repository until data at the cache is
refreshed. In data-intensive scientific disciplines, such as astronomy,
indiscriminate query routing or data refreshing often results in runaway
network costs. This severely affects the performance and scalability of the

decouples data objects---choosing to keep some data object at the cache, when
they are heavily queried, and keeping some data objects at the repository, when
they are heavily updated. Our algorithm profiles incoming workload to search
for optimal data decoupling that reduces network costs. It leverages formal

these functions should be polynomials (the so-called fluxbrane polynomials). A
program (in Maple) for calculating of these polynomials for classical series of
Lie algebras is suggested (see Appendix). The polynomials corresponding to the
Lie algebra D_4 are obtained. It is conjectured that the polynomials for A_n-,
B_n- and C_n-series may be obtained from polynomials for D_{n+1}-series by
using certain reduction formulas.

enters only through the (Floquet-Bloch) spectral band dispersion associated
with the periodic structure; chromatic dispersion (time-nonlocality of the

conditions of wave-packet type (a plane wave of fixed carrier frequency
multiplied by a slow varying, spatially localized function) very long-lived
spatially localized coherent soliton-like structures emerge, whose character is
that of a slowly varying envelope of a train of shocks. We call this structure
an envelope carrier-shock train.
  The structure of the solution violates the oft-assumed nearly monochromatic
wave packet structure, whose envelope is governed by the nonlinear coupled mode
equations (NLCME). The inconsistency and inaccuracy of NLCME lies in the
neglect of all (infinitely many) resonances except for the principle resonance
induced by the initial carrier frequency. We derive, via a nonlinear
geometrical optics expansion, a system of nonlocal integro-differential
equations governing the coupled evolution of backward and forward propagating
waves. These equations incorporate effects of all resonances. In a periodic
medium, these equations may be expressed as a system of infinitely many coupled
mode equations, which we call the extended nonlinear coupled mode system
(xNLCME). Truncating xNLCME to include only the principle resonances leads to
the classical NLCME.
  Numerical simulations of xNLCME demonstrate that it captures both large scale

typical intrinsic time-dependence for the burst, we find gamma-ray light curves
that have a temporal microstructure similar to that observed in some reported

the production of gravitational waves. We find that the precession of accretion

and spatially-inhomogeneous solutions in Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity with
particular couplings. Similar to the supersymmetric case the solution can be
arbitrarily superposed in spite of non-trivial time-dependence, since the
metric is specified by a set of harmonic functions. When each harmonic has a
single point source at the center, the solution describes a spherically
symmetric black hole with regular Killing horizons and the spacetime approaches
asymptotically to the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmology.
We discuss in this paper that in 5-dimensions this equilibrium condition traces
back to the 1st-order ""Killing spinor"" equation in ""fake supergravity"" coupled
to arbitrary U(1) gauge fields and scalars. We present a 5-dimensional,
asymptotically FLRW, rotating black-hole solution admitting a nontrivial
""Killing spinor,"" which is a spinning generalization of our previous solution.
We argue that the solution admits nondegenerate and rotating Killing horizons
in contrast with the supersymmetric solutions. It is shown that the present
pseudo-supersymmetric solution admits closed timelike curves around the central
singularities. When only one harmonic is time-dependent, the solution oxidizes
to 11-dimensions and realizes the dynamically intersecting M2/M2/M2-branes in a
rotating Kasner universe. The Kaluza-Klein type black holes are also discussed.

anomalous non-Gaussian diffusion when immersed in a dilute suspension of
self-motile Chlamydomonas reinhardtii algae. Qualitatively, this observation
can be explained by the fact that the algae induce a fluid flow that may
occasionally accelerate the colloidal tracers to relatively large velocities. A
satisfactory quantitative theory of enhanced mixing in dilute active
suspensions, however, is lacking at present. In particular, it is unclear how
non-Gaussian signatures in the tracers' position distribution are linked to the

theoretical description of anomalous tracer diffusion in active suspensions,
based on a simplified tracer-swimmer interaction model that captures the
typical distance scaling of a microswimmer's flow field. We show that the
experimentally observed non-Gaussian tails are generic and arise due to a
combination of truncated L\'evy statistics for the velocity field and
algebraically decaying time correlations in the fluid. Our analytical
considerations are illustrated through extensive simulations, implemented on

complex manifold $X$, we take a suitable exhaustion $\{X_r\}_{r>0}$ admitting
complete \ke s of negative Ricci. Taking a positive decreasing sequence
$\{\lambda_r\}_{r>0}, \lim_{r\to\infty}\lambda_r=0$, we rescale the metric so
that $g_r$ is the complete \ke\ in $X_r$ of Ricci curvature $-\lambda_r$. The
idea is to show the limiting metric $\lim_{r\to\infty} g_r$ does exist. If so,
it is a Ricci-flat metric in $X$. Several examples: $X=\mathbb C^n$ and $X=TM$

  The existence of complete \ke s of negative Ricci in bounded domains of

dynamically bounded services. In our previous work [15], we have described a
framework for performing runtime monitoring of web service against behavioural
correctness properties (described using property patterns and converted into
finite state automata). These specify forbidden behavior (safety properties)
and desired behavior (bounded liveness properties). Finite execution traces of
web services described in BPEL are checked for conformance at runtime. When
violations are discovered, our framework automatically proposes and ranks
recovery plans which users can then select for execution. Such plans for safety
violations essentially involve ""going back"" - compensating the executed actions
until an alternative behaviour of the application is possible. For bounded
liveness violations, recovery plans include both ""going back"" and ""re-planning""
- guiding the application towards a desired behaviour. Our experience, reported
in [16], identified a drawback in this approach: we compute too many plans due
to (a) overapproximating the number of program points where an alternative
behaviour is possible and (b) generating recovery plans for bounded liveness
properties which can potentially violate safety properties. In this paper, we
describe improvements to our framework that remedy these problems and describe
their effectiveness on a case study.

attack vector, and this manner is benefited from the syntax meanings that are
labeled by the proposed tokenizing mechanism. Bayes theorem is used to
determine the number of hidden states in the model for generalizing the
structure model. The paper has the contributions as following: (1)
automatically learn the structure of attack vectors from practical data

the systems with regular 4-body interactions, the transition temperature

without a coupling of viscosity to the actual thermal state of the gas. The
model description of a turbulent disk consisting of emerging and spreading
clumps (Vollmer & Beckert 2003) contains free parameters, which can be
constrained by observations of molecular gas, atomic gas and the star formation
rate for individual galaxies. Radial profiles of 18 nearby spiral galaxies from
THINGS, HERACLES, SINGS, and GALEX data are used to compare the observed star
formation efficiency, molecular fraction, and velocity dispersion to the model.
The observed radially decreasing velocity dispersion can be reproduced by the
model. In the framework of this model the decrease in the inner disk is due to
the stellar mass distribution which dominates the gravitational potential.
Introducing a radial break in the star formation efficiency into the model
improves the fits significantly. This change in star formation regime is
realized by replacing the free fall time in the prescription of the star
formation rate with the molecule formation timescale. Depending on the star
formation prescription, the break radius is located near the transition region
between the molecular-gas-dominated and atomic-gas-dominated parts of the
galactic disk or closer to the optical radius. It is found that only less
massive galaxies (log (M (M_solar)) <~ 10) can balance gas loss via star
formation by radial gas accretion within the disk. These galaxies can thus
access their gas reservoirs with large angular momentum. On the other hand, the
star formation of massive galaxies is determined by the external gas mass
accretion rate from a putative spherical halo of ionized gas or from satellite
accretion.

mean-field hydrodynamics is presented and tested by computing the differential
rotation of the Sun. The model is then applied to four individual stars
including two moderate and two fast rotators to reproduce their observed
differential rotation quite closely. A series of models for rapidly rotating
($P_{rot} = 1$ day) stars of different masses and compositions is generated.
The effective temperature is found convenient to parameterize the differential
rotation: variations with metallicity, that are quite pronounced when the
differential rotation is considered as a function of the stellar mass, almost
disappear in the dependence of differential rotation on temperature. The
differential rotation increases steadily with surface temperature to exceed the
largest differential rotation observed to date for the hottest F-stars we
considered. This strong differential rotation is, however, found not to be
efficient for dynamos when the efficiency is estimated with the standard
$C_\Omega$-parameter of dynamo models. On the contrary, the small differential
rotation of M-stars is the most dynamo-efficient. The meridional flow near the
bottom of the convection zone is not small compared to the flow at the top in
all our computations. The flow is distributed over the entire convection zone
in slow rotators but retreats to the convection zone boundaries with increasing
rotation rate, to consist of two near-boundary jets in rapid rotators. The
implications of the change of the flow structure for stellar dynamos are
briefly discussed.

valuable tool to study the medium produced in heavy-ion collisions, as due to
uncertainty arguments their cross section should be calculable independent of
medium properties whereas the medium then modifies only the final state partons
emerging from a hard vertex. With the heavy-ion physics program at the CERN LHC
imminent, the attention of high P_T physics in heavy ion collisions is shifting
from the observation of hard single hadrons to fully reconstructed jets.
However, the presence of a background medium at low P_T complicates jet-finding
as compared to p-p collisions. Monte-Carlo (MC) codes designed to simulate the
evolution of parton showers evolving into hadron jets are valuable tools to
understand the complicated interplay between the medium modification of the jet
and the bias introduced by a specific jet-finding scheme. However, such codes
also use a set of approximations which needs to be tested against the better
understood single high P_T hadron observables. In this paper, I review the
ideas underlying the MC code YaJEM (Yet another Jet Energy-loss Model) and

implies association in the sense of Esary, Proschan and Walkup, while for
random vectors this simple relationship breaks. We modify the notion of
association in such a way that any vector-valued process with independent
increments has also associated increments in the new sense --- association
between blocks. The new notion is quite natural and admits nice
characterization for some classes of processes. In particular, using the
covariance interpolation formula due to Houdr\'{e}, P\'{e}rez-Abreu and
Surgailis, we show that within the class of multidimensional Gaussian processes
block-association of increments is equivalent to supermodularity (in time) of
the covariance functions. We define also corresponding versions of weak
association, positive association and negative association. It turns out that
the Central Limit Theorem for weakly associated random vectors due to Burton,
Dabrowski and Dehling remains valid, if the weak association is relaxed to the
weak association between blocks.

source radius (Helmholtz number). The acoustic field is found in terms of the
elementary fields generated by a set of line sources whose form is given by
Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind, and whose amplitude is found to be
given by weighted integrals of the radial source term. The analysis is
developed for tonal sources, such as rotors, and, for Helmholtz number less

cross-spectrum between two points in the acoustic field. The analysis is
applied to the problems of tonal radiation, random source radiation as a model

stochastic holding period (SHP) models. This is done in order to obtain a
`liquidity-adjusted risk measure' characterized by the absence of a fixed time
horizon. The underlying assumption is that - due to changes on market liquidity
conditions - one operates along an `operational time' to which the P&L process
of liquidating a market portfolio is referred. This framework leads to a
mixture of distributions for the portfolio returns, potentially allowing for
skewness, heavy tails and extreme scenarios. We analyze the impact of possible
distributional choices for the SHP. In a multivariate setting, we hint at the
possible introduction of dependent SHP processes, which potentially lead to non
linear dependence among the P&L processes and therefore to tail dependence
across assets in the portfolio, although this may require drastic choices on
the SHP distributions. We also find that increasing dependence as measured by
Kendall's tau through common SHP's appears to be unfeasible. We finally discuss
potential developments following future availability of market data.

poly[2-methoxy-5-(2'-ethyl-hexyloxy)-1,4-phenylene vinylene] (MEH-PPV) with
varying conjugation, and polyethylene dioxythiophene complexed with polystyrene
sulfonate (PEDOT-PSS) in different solvents have shown the important role of
pi-electron conjugation and solvent-chain interactions in controlling the chain
conformation and assembly. In MEH-PPV, by increasing the extent of conjugation
from 30 to 100 %, the persistence length (l_p) increases from 20 to 66
Angstrom. Moreover, a pronounced second peak in the pair distribution function
has been observed in fully conjugated chain, at larger length scales. This
feature indicates that the chain segments tend to self-assemble as the
conjugation along the chain increases. In case of PEDOT-PSS, the chains undergo
solvent induced expansion and enhanced chain organization. The clusters formed
by chains are better correlated in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution than
water, as observed in the scattered intensity profiles. The values of radius of
gyration and the exponent (water: 2.6, DMSO: 2.31) of power-law decay, obtained
from the unified scattering function (Beaucage) analysis, give evidence for
chain expansion from compact (in water) to extended coil in DMSO solutions,
which is consistent with the Kratky plot analysis. The mechanism of this
transition and the increase in dc conductivity of PEDOT-PSS in DMSO solution
are discussed. The onset frequency for the increase in ac conduction as well as
its temperature dependence probes the extent of connectivity in PEDOT-PSS
system. The enhanced charge transport in PEDOT-PSS in DMSO is attributed to the
extended chain conformation as observed in SAXS results.

term representation of structured documents and relational nature of Prolog
which facilitates transparent integration of relational databases. Although we
developed the system for accessing in-house biochemical and genomic data the
interface is generic and provides a number of extensible features. We describe

outline an in-house library that facilitates interaction between Prolog and the

IRAS, Spitzer, BLAST, Herschel and SCUBA and identify the range of dust
temperatures these surveys are sensitive to, for galaxies in the ULIRG
luminosity range (12<log(LIR)<13), between z=0 and z=4. We find that the extent
of the redshift range over which surveys are unbiased is a function of the
wavelength of selection, flux density limit and ULIRG luminosity. Short
wavelength (<200{\mu}m) surveys with IRAS, Spitzer/MIPS and Herschel/PACS are
sensitive to all SED types in a large temperature interval (17-87K), over a
substantial fraction of their accessible redshift range. On the other hand,
long wavelength (>200{\mu}m) surveys with BLAST, Herschel/ SPIRE and SCUBA are
significantly more sensitive to cold ULIRGs, disfavouring warmer SEDs even at
low redshifts. We evaluate observations in the context of survey selection
effects, finding that the lack of cold ULIRGs in the local (z<0.1) Universe is
not a consequence of selection and that the range of ULIRG temperatures seen
locally is only a subset of a much larger range which exists at high redshift.
We demonstrate that the local luminosity-temperature (L-T) relation, which
indicates that more luminous sources are also hotter, is not applicable in the
distant Universe when extrapolated to the ULIRG regime, because the scatter in
observed temperatures is too large. Finally, we show that the difference
between the ULIRG temperature distributions locally and at high redshift is not
the result of galaxies becoming colder due to an L-T relation which evolves as
a function of redshift. Instead, they are consistent with a picture where the

flow for handover procedures due to different 2-tier cell (macrocell and

with minimum signaling. A frequent and unnecessary handover is another problem
for hierarchical femtocell/macrocell network environment that must be
minimized. This work studies the details mobility management schemes for small

two different network architectures for small scale and medium scale WCDMA
femtocell deployment. The details handover call flow for these two network

H-solubility in the spatially-varying strain fields of realistic dislocations.
We find that H is strongly trapped by dislocations of both the edge and screw

dislocation cores. The strain dependence of the solution energy leading to
accumulation of H near dislocation cores, as well as the reduction of elastic

the block structure such as the occurrence of a robust gap in the middle of the
spectrum. Without randomness in the off-diagonal blocks the density of states
typically exhibits an inverse square-root singularity at the edges of the gap.
In the presence of randomness we establish a Wegner estimate that is valid at
all energies. It implies that the singularities are smeared out by randomness,
and the density of states is bounded. We also show Lifshits tails at these band

reconstruction, techniques proposed in this vein often considerably boost the
performance in subspace settings where traditional SC can fail. Despite the
success, there are fundamental problems that have been left unsolved: the
spectrum property of the learned affinity matrix cannot be gauged in advance,
and there is often one ugly symmetrization step that post-processes the
affinity for SC input. Hence we advocate to enforce the symmetric positive
semidefinite constraint explicitly during learning (Low-Rank Representation
with Positive SemiDefinite constraint, or LRR-PSD), and show that factually it
can be solved in an exquisite scheme efficiently instead of general-purpose SDP
solvers that usually scale up poorly. We provide rigorous mathematical
derivations to show that, in its canonical form, LRR-PSD is equivalent to the
recently proposed Low-Rank Representation (LRR) scheme {liu2010robust}, and
hence offer theoretic and practical insights to both LRR-PSD and LRR, inviting
future research. As per the computational cost, our proposal is at most
comparable to that of LRR, if not less. We validate our theoretic analysis and
optimization scheme by experiments on both synthetic and real data sets.

of target Single Spin Asymmetries (SSA) from semi-inclusive electro-production
of charged pions from a 40-cm long transversely polarized $^3$He target in
Deep-Inelastic-Scattering kinematics using 11 and 8.8 GeV electron beams. This
new coincidence experiment in Hall A will employ a newly proposed solenoid
spectrometer (SoLID). The large acceptance spectrometer and the high polarized
luminosity will provide precise 4-D ($x$, $z$, $P_T$ and $Q^2$) data on the
Collins, Sivers, and pretzelocity asymmetries for the neutron through the
azimuthal angular dependence. The full 2$\pi$ azimuthal angular coverage in the
lab is essential in controlling the systematic uncertainties. The results from
this experiment, when combined with the proton Collins asymmetry measurement
and the Collins fragmentation function determined from the e$^+$e$^-$ collision
data, will allow for a quark flavor separation in order to achieve a
determination of the tensor charge of the d quark to a 10% accuracy. The
extracted Sivers and pretzelocity asymmetries will provide important
information to understand the correlations between the quark orbital angular
momentum and the nucleon spin and between the quark spin and nucleon spin.

modelled explicitly as a superposition of signals concerning relevant market
factors and independent noise. The rate at which the signal is revealed to the
market then determines the overall magnitude of asset volatility. By letting
this information flow rate random, we obtain an elementary stochastic
volatility model within the information-based approach. Such an extension is
economically justified on account of the fact that in real markets information
flow rates are rarely measurable. Effects of having a random information flow
rate is investigated in detail in the context of a simple model setup.
Specifically, the price process of the asset is derived, and its characteristic
behaviours are revealed via simulation studies. The price of a European-style
option is worked out, showing that the model has a sufficient flexibility to
fit volatility surface. As an extension of the random information flow model,
price manipulation is considered. A simple model is used to show how the

studied as well the effect of the excitations from the 100-Sn core on our

align to J=11 and T=0. In 110-Xe and 112-Xe the alignment begins in the J=10

termination the alignment of a neutron and a proton to J=11 and T=0 takes over.

temporal growth is ballistic, while generally it is sub-linear. For the

have been shown to have atypical properties. These SNe are faint (absolute peak
magnitude of ~ -15) and fast SNe that show unique composition. They are
inferred to have low ejecta mass (a few tenths of a solar mass) and to be
highly enriched in calcium, but poor in silicon elements and nickel. These SNe
were therefore suggested to belong to a new class of calcium-rich faint SNe
explosions. Their properties were proposed to be the result of helium
detonations that may occur on helium accreting white dwarfs. In this paper we
theoretically study the scenario of helium detonations, and focus on the
results of detonations in accreted helium layers on low mass carbon-oxygen (CO)
cores. We present new results from one dimensional simulations of such
explosions, including their light curves and spectra. We find that when the
density of the helium layer is low enough the helium detonation produces large
amounts of intermediate elements, such as calcium and titanium, together with a
large amount of unburnt helium. Our results suggest that the properties of
calcium-rich faint SNe could indeed be consistent with the helium-detonation
scenario on small CO cores. Above a certain density (larger CO cores) the
detonation leaves mainly 56Ni and unburnt helium, and the predicted spectrum
will unlikely fit the unique features of this class of SNe. Finally, none of
our studied models reproduces the bright, fast evolving light curves of another
type of peculiar SNe suggested to originate in helium detonations (SNe 1885A,

a simple and elegant solution in principle, in practice passive state
preparation might be desirable in some scenarios, for instance, in those
experimental setups operating at high transmission rates. Passive schemes might
also be more robust against side-channel attacks than active sources. Typical
passive devices involve parametric down-conversion. In this paper, we show that
both coherent light and practical single photon sources are also suitable for
passive generation of BB84 signal states. Our method does not require any
external-driven element, but only linear optical components and photodetectors.

of this work is to derive the physical conditions pertaining to the warm
molecular gas and study their variations within the flow. The mid-IR H2
emission follows the morphology of the precessing flow, with peaks correlated
with individual CO clumps and H2 2.12{\mu}m ro-vibrational emission. More
diffuse emission delineating the CO cavities is detected only in the low-laying
transitions, with J(lower) less or equal to 2. The H2 line images have been
used to construct 2D maps of N(H2), H2 ortho-to-para ratio and temperature
spectral index beta, in the assumption of a gas temperature stratification
where the H2 column density varies as T^(beta). Variations of these parameters
are observed along the flow. In particular, the ortho-to-para ratio ranges from
0.6 to 2.8, highlighting the presence of regions subject to recent shocks where
the ortho-to-para ratio has not had time yet to reach the equilibrium value.
Near-IR spectroscopic data on ro-vibrational H2 emission have been combined
with the mid-IR data and used to derive additional shock parameters in the
brightest blue- and red-shifted emission knots. A high abundance of atomic
hydrogen (H/H2 about 0.1-0.3) is implied by the observed H2 column densities,
assuming n(H2) values as derived by independent SiO observations. The presence
of a high fraction of atomic hydrogen, indicates that a partially-dissociative
shock component should be considered for the H2 excitation in these localized
regions. However, planar shock models, either of C- or J-type, are not able to
consistently reproduce all the physical parameters derived from our analysis of
the H2 emission. Globally, H2 emission contributes to about 50% of the total
shock radiated energy in the L1157 outflow.

senses the relativistic shift in the frequency of laser-diode oscillators set

fiber optics and a digital electronic interferometer/spectrometer to measure
the effect of the relativistic time dilation on the frequency-modulated (FM)
harmonic amplitudes in the beat signals between the tip-diodes and a stationary
reference diode. The FM amplitudes depend on the orientation of the rotor. For
the vertical-east-west orientation with a rotor frequency of 73.9 Hz, the

respectively 7x10^-10 Hz, 4x10^-11 Hz, and 9x10^-11 Hz. The overtones in the
beat signals can be amplified and observed with a tunable FM digital audio

naturally induced from the TeV scale dynamics without introducing any
artificial assumption on magnitudes of coupling constants. The combination of

spectacular case is photo-induced water condensation. These non-equilibrium

and two-qubit ($q=2^2$) systems, the octit ($q=8$), qubit/quartit ($q=2\times
4$) and three-qubit ($q=2^3$) systems, and so on. In the single qudit case,
e.g. $q=4,8,12,...$, one defines a bijection between the $\sigma (q)$ maximal
commuting sets [with $\sigma[q)$ the sum of divisors of $q$] of Pauli
observables and the maximal submodules of the modular ring $\mathbb{Z}_q^2$,
that arrange into the projective line $P_1(\mathbb{Z}_q)$ and a independent set
of size $\sigma (q)-\psi(q)$ [with $\psi(q)$ the Dedekind psi function]. In the
multiple qudit case, e.g. $q=2^2, 2^3, 3^2,...$, the Pauli graphs rely on
symplectic polar spaces such as the generalized quadrangles GQ(2,2) (if
$q=2^2$) and GQ(3,3) (if $q=3^2$). More precisely, in dimension $p^n$ ($p$ a
prime) of the Hilbert space, the observables of the Pauli group (modulo the
center) are seen as the elements of the $2n$-dimensional vector space over the
field $\mathbb{F}_p$. In this space, one makes use of the commutator to define
a symplectic polar space $W_{2n-1}(p)$ of cardinality $\sigma(p^{2n-1})$, that
encodes the maximal commuting sets of the Pauli group by its totally isotropic
subspaces. Building blocks of $W_{2n-1}(p)$ are punctured polar spaces (i.e. a
observable and all maximum cliques passing to it are removed) of size given by
the Dedekind psi function $\psi(p^{2n-1})$. For multiple qudit mixtures (e.g.
qubit/quartit, qubit/octit and so on), one finds multiple copies of polar
spaces, ponctured polar spaces, hypercube geometries and other intricate
structures. Such structures play a role in the science of quantum information.

(very cold, low-mass white dwarfs, accreting at very low rates) we find bona
fide classical novae that are very luminous and red because they eject very
slowly moving, massive envelopes. A crucial prediction of these nova models -
in contrast to the predictions of merging star (""mergeburst"") models - is that
a hot remnant, the underlying white dwarf, will emerge after the massive
ejected envelope has expanded enough to become optically thin. This blue
remnant must fade on a timescale of decades - much faster than a ""mergeburst"",
which must fade on timescales of millennia or longer. Furthermore, the cooling
nova white dwarf and its expanding ejecta must become redder in the years after
eruption, while a contracting mergeburst must become hotter and bluer. We
predict that red novae will always brighten to L~1000 Lsun for about 1 year
before rising to maximum luminosity at L~10^6 - 10^7 Lsun. The maximum
luminosity attainable by a nova is likely to be L~10^7 Lsun, corresponding to

theory of renormalization trace back to the work on divergent series by Euler
and by mathematicians of two centuries ago. Feynman, Dyson, Schwinger...
rediscovered most of these mathematical ""curiosities"" and were able to develop
a new and powerful way of looking at physical phenomena.
