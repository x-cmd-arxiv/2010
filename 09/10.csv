(dSphs). The stellar component has an isotropic, lowered isothermal (or King)
distribution function. A physical basis for the isotropization of stellar
velocities is given by tidal stirring, whilst the isothermality of the
distribution function guarantees the observed flatness of the velocity
dispersion profile in the inner parts. Our models reproduce the data on the
half-light radius and line of sight central velocity dispersion of the dSphs.
We show that different dark halo profiles -- whether cored or cusped -- lead to
very similar mass estimates within one particular radius, namely 1.7 half-light
radii. Deviations between mass measures due to different density profiles are
substantially smaller than the uncertainties propagated by the observational
errors. We produce a mass measure for each of the Milky Way dSphs and find that
the two most massive are the most luminous, namely Sagittarius (~ 2.8 x 10^8
solar masses) and Fornax (~ 1.3 x 10^8 solar masses). The least massive of the
Milky Way satellites are Willman 1 (~ 4 x 10^5 solar masses) and Segue 1 (~ 6 x

certain rationally smooth toric varieties $X(J)$ that come naturally from the

a density matched model suspension with varying volume fraction ({\phi} = 15%

beginning of the detachment process, the suspensions behave as an effective
fluid. The detachment dynamics in this regime can be entirely described by the
shear viscosity of the suspension. At later stages of the detachment the
dynamics become independent of the volume fraction and are found to be
identical to the dynamics of the interstitial fluid. Surprisingly, visual
observation reveals that at this stage particles are still present in the neck.
We suspect rearrangements of particles to locally free the neck of grains,
causing the observed dynamics. Close to the final pinch off, the detachment of
the suspensions is further accelerated, compared to the dynamics of pure
interstitial fluid. This acceleration might be due to the fact that the neck
diameter gets of the order of magnitude of the size of the grains and a
continuous thinning of the liquid thread is not possible any more. The
crossover between the different detachment regimes is function of the grain
size and the initial volume fraction. We characterize the overall acceleration

the rotational temperatures and column densities of the dense gas, and using a
Large Velocity Gradients model to calculate the H2 density structure in the

gradients in the molecular clouds, showing similar excitation conditions, and
suggesting that they arise from the same gas components. In M82, CH3CCH has the
highest fractional abundance determined in a extragalactic source (10^-8). The
density and the chemical gradients found in all galaxies can be explained in
the framework of the starburst evolution. The young shock-dominatedstarburst
galaxies, like presumably Maffei2, show a cloud structure with a rather uniform
density and chemical composition which suggests low star formation activity.
Molecular clouds in galaxies with starburst in an intermediate stage of
evolution, such as NGC253 and IC342, show clouds with a large density contrast
(two orders of magnitude) between the denser regions (cores) and the less dense
regions (halos) of the molecular clouds and relatively constant chemical
abundance. Finally, the galaxy with the most evolved starburst, M82, has clouds
with a rather uniform density structure, large envelopes of atomic/molecular

RESPER probe. A uniform ADC, which is characterized by a sensible phase
inaccuracy depending on frequency, is connected to a Fast Fourier Transform
(FFT) processor, that is especially affected by a round-off amplitude noise
linked to both the FFT register length and samples number. If the register
length is equal to 32 bits, then the round-off noise is entirely negligible,
else, once bits are reduced to 16, a technique of compensation must occur. In
fact, oversampling can be employed within a short time window, reaching a
compromise between the needs of limiting the phase inaccuracy due to ADC and
not raising too much the number of averaged FFT values sufficient to bound the
round-off. Finally, the appendix presents an outline of somewhat lengthy
demonstrations needed to calculate the amplitude and especially phase
inaccuracies due to the round-off noise of FFT processors.

publicly released by the Kepler project. Using the stellar parameters from the
Kepler Input Catalog, we have separated the sample into 129,000 dwarfs and
17,000 giants, and further sub-divided the luminosity classes into temperature
bins corresponding approximately to the spectral classes A, F, G, K, and M.
Utilizing the inherent sampling and time baseline of the public dataset (30
minute sampling and 33.5 day baseline), we have explored the variability of the
stellar sample. The overall variability rate of the dwarfs is 25% for the
entire sample, but can reach 100% for the brightest groups of stars in the
sample. G-dwarfs are found to be the most stable with a dispersion floor of
$\sigma \sim 0.04$ mmag. At the precision of Kepler, $>95$% of the giant stars
are variable with a noise floor of $\sim 0.1$ mmag, 0.3 mmag, and 10 mmag for
the G-giants, K-giants, and M-giants, respectively. The photometric dispersion
of the giants is consistent with acoustic variations of the photosphere; the
photometrically-derived predicted radial velocity distribution for the K-giants
is in agreement with the measured radial velocity distribution. We have also
briefly explored the variability fraction as a function of dataset baseline (1
- 33 days), at the native 30-minute sampling of the public Kepler data. To
within the limitations of the data, we find that the overall variability
fractions increase as the dataset baseline is increased from 1 day to 33 days,
in particular for the most variable stars. The lower mass M-dwarf, K-dwarf,
G-dwarf stars increase their variability more significantly than the higher
mass F-dwarf and A-dwarf stars as the time-baseline is increased, indicating
that the variability of the lower mass stars is mostly characterized by
timescales of weeks whi...astroph will not allow longer abstract!

empirically-based trophic ecosystem models to test the hypothesis that indirect
flows dominate direct flows in ecosystem networks. Further, we used Monte Carlo
based perturbations to investigate the robustness of these results to potential
error in the underlying data. To explain our findings, we further investigated
the importance of the microbial food web in recycling energy-matter using
components of the Finn Cycling Index and analysis of Environ Centrality. We
found that indirect flows dominate direct flows in 37/50 (74.0%) models. This
increases to 31/35 (88.5%) models when we consider only models that have
cycling structure and a representation of the microbial food web. The
uncertainty analysis reveals that there is less error in the I/D values than
the $\pm$ 5% error introduced into the models, suggesting the results are
robust to uncertainty. Our results show that the microbial food web mediates a
substantial percentage of cycling in some systems (median = 30.2%), but its
role is highly variable in these models, in agreement with the literature. Our
results, combined with previous work, strongly suggest that indirect effects
are dominant components of activity in ecosystems.

investigate the quality of these lines as abundance indicators. Method. We
measure these lines in two turn-off (TO) stars in the Globular Cluster NGC 6752

hydrodynamical model atmospheres computed with the CO5BOLD code. These
abundances are compared to the Cu abundances measured in giant stars of the
same clusters, using the lines of Mult. 2 at 510.5 nm and 578.2 nm. Results.
The abundances derived from the lines of Mult. 1 in TO stars differ from the
abundances of giants of the same clusters. This is true both using CO5BOLD
models and using traditional 1D model atmospheres. The LTE 3D corrections for
TO stars are large, while they are small for giant stars. Conclusions. The Cu I
resonance lines of Mult. 1 are not reliable abundance indicators. It is likely
that departures from LTE should be taken into account to properly describe
these lines, although it is not clear if these alone can account for the
observations. An investigation of these departures is indeed encouraged for
both dwarfs and giants. Our recommendation to those interested in the study of
the evolution of copper abundances is to rely on the measurements in giants,
based on the lines of Mult. 2. We caution, however, that NLTE studies may imply
a revision in all the Cu abundances, both in dwarfs and giants.

symmetrized versions of $TC_n(X)$. The first one, unlike Farber-Grant's
symmetric topological complexity, turns out to be a homotopy invariant of $X$;
the second one is closely tied to the homotopical properties of the
configuration space of cardinality-$n$ subsets of $X$. Special attention is
given to the case of spheres.

distribution and level of star formation and dust obscuration in the nearby
tidally distorted galaxy NGC2442. Spitzer images in the IR at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8,
8.0um, and 24um and GALEX images at 1500\AA{} and 2300\AA{} allow us to resolve
the galaxy on scales between 240-600pc. We supplement these with archival data
in the B, J, H, and K bands. We use the 8um, 24um and FUV (1500\AA) emission to
study the star formation rate (SFR). We find that globally, these tracers of
star formation give a range of results of ~6-11\msun/yr, with the
dust-corrected FUV giving the highest value of SFR. We can reconcile the UV and
IR-based estimates by adopting a steeper UV extinction curve that lies in
between the starburst (Calzetti) and SMC extinction curves. However, the
regions of highest SFR intensity along the spiral arms are consistent with a
starburst-like extinction. Overall, the level of star-formation we find is
higher than previously published for this galaxy, by about a factor of two,
which, contrary to previous conclusions, implies that the interaction that
caused the distorted morphology of NGC2442 likely also triggered increased
levels of star-formation activity. Outside of the spiral arms, we discover what
appears to be a superbubble, ~1.7kpc across in the IRAC images. Significant
H{\alpha}, UV and IR emission in the area also suggest vigorous ongoing
star-formation. A known, recent supernova (SN1999ga) is located at the edge of
this superbubble. Although speculative at this stage, this area suggests a
large star-forming region with a morphology shaped by generations of
supernovae. Lastly, we discover an 8um (PAH) circumnuclear ring with an ~0.8kpc
radius. The H{\alpha} emission is largely concentrated inside that ring and
shows a vague spiral structure in the rest of the galaxy.

by standard physics has recently led to the suggestion that the peculiar jet
structure observed above ~ 10E16 eV could be due to a suppression of effective
space transverse dimensions. The new pattern considered violates Lorentz
symmetry. We point out that, in models with Lorentz symmetry violation, a
suppression of available transverse energy for jets while conserving
longitudinal momentum can be generated by new forms of energy losses at very
high energy without altering space-time structure. An illustrative example can
be superbradyon emission, where in all cases the superbradyon energy would be
much larger than its momentum times c (speed of light). More generally, such
phenomena could be due to the interaction of the high-energy cosmic ray with
new vacuum and/or particle structure below the 10E-20 cm scale. Scenarios
involving Lorentz symmetry violation but not superbradyons are also briefly
considered.

The vertices are replaced by unity while each propagator becomes a dual

The momentum twistor MHV rules generate a formula for the full, all-loop planar
integrand of the super Yang-Mills S-matrix that is manifestly dual
superconformally invariant up to the choice of a reference twistor. We give a
general proof of this reformulation and illustrate its use by computing the

evidence for anisotropy in the arrival directions of cosmic rays above the
Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuz'min energy threshold, \nobreak{$6\times 10^{19}$eV}. The
anisotropy was measured by the fraction of arrival directions that are less
than $3.1^\circ$ from the position of an active galactic nucleus within 75 Mpc
(using the V\'eron-Cetty and V\'eron $12^{\rm th}$ catalog). An updated
measurement of this fraction is reported here using the arrival directions of
cosmic rays recorded above the same energy threshold through 31 December 2009.
The number of arrival directions has increased from 27 to 69, allowing a more
precise measurement. The correlating fraction is $(38^{+7}_{-6})%$, compared
with $21%$ expected for isotropic cosmic rays. This is down from the early
estimate of $(69^{+11}_{-13})%$. The enlarged set of arrival directions is
examined also in relation to other populations of nearby extragalactic objects:
galaxies in the 2 Microns All Sky Survey and active galactic nuclei detected in
hard X-rays by the Swift Burst Alert Telescope. A celestial region around the
position of the radiogalaxy Cen A has the largest excess of arrival directions
relative to isotropic expectations. The 2-point autocorrelation function is
shown for the enlarged set of arrival directions and compared to the isotropic
expectation.

Mrk573 using Chandra, XMM-Newton and HST data. The X-ray morphology shows a
biconical region extending up to 12 arcsecs (4 kpc) in projection from the
nucleus. A strong correlation between the X-rays and the highly ionized gas
seen in the [O III] image is reported. Moreover, we have studied the line
intensities detected with the RGS/XMM-Newton and used them to fit the low
resolution EPIC/XMM-Newton and ACIS/Chandra spectra. The RGS spectrum is
dominated by emission lines of C VI, O VII, O VIII, Fe XVII, and Ne IX, among
others. A good fit is obtained using these emission lines found in the RGS
spectrum as a template for Chandra spectra of the nucleus and extended
emission. The photoionization model Cloudy provides a reasonable fit for both
the nuclear region and the cone-like structures. For the nucleus the emission
is modelled using two phases: a high ionization [log(U)=1.23] and a low
ionization [log(U)=0.13]. For the high ionization phase the transmitted and
reflected component are in a ratio 1:2, whereas for the low ionization the
reflected component dominates. For the extended emission, we successfully
reproduced the emission with two phases. The first phase shows a higher
ionization parameter for the NW (log(U)=0.9) than for the SE cone (log(U)=0.3).
The second phase shows a low ionization parameter (log(U)=-3) and is rather
uniform for NW and SE cones. In addition, the nuclear optical/infrared SED has
been modeled by a clumpy torus model. The torus bolometric luminosity agrees
with the AGN luminosity inferred from the observed hard X-ray spectrum. The
optical depth along the line of sight derived from the SED fit indicates a high
neutral column density in agreement with the classification of the nucleus as a
Compton-thick AGN.

type refinements are bidirectional, leading to a straightforward proof of
decidability of typechecking even in the presence of intersection types.
Because we insist on canonical forms, structural rules for subtyping can now be
derived rather than being assumed as primitive. We illustrate the expressive
power of our system with examples and validate its design by demonstrating a
precise correspondence with traditional presentations of subtyping. Proof
irrelevance provides a mechanism for selectively hiding the identities of terms
in type theories. We show that LF refinement types can be interpreted as
predicates using proof irrelevance, establishing a uniform relationship between
two previously studied concepts in type theory. The interpretation and its

Ngo Bao Chau, for which he was awarded a Fields Medal. Our aim here is to touch
on some of the beautiful ideas contributing to the Fundamental Lemma and its

algorithm visualizes such a tree as a hierarchical partition of a square into
rectangles, where the area of the rectangle corresponding to any node in

rectangles in such a rectangular partition necessarily depends on the weights
and can become arbitrarily high.
  We introduce a new hierarchical partition scheme, called a polygonal
partition, which uses convex polygons rather than just rectangles. We present
two methods for constructing polygonal partitions, both having guarantees on
the worst-case aspect ratio of the constructed polygons; in particular, both
methods guarantee a bound on the aspect ratio that is independent of the
weights of the nodes.
  We also consider rectangular partitions with slack, where the areas of the
rectangles may differ slightly from the weights of the corresponding nodes. We
show that this makes it possible to obtain partitions with constant aspect
ratio. This result generalizes to hyper-rectangular partitions in
$\mathbb{R}^d$. We use these partitions with slack for embedding ultrametrics
into $d$-dimensional Euclidean space: we give a $\mathop{\rm
polylog}(\Delta)$-approximation algorithm for embedding $n$-point ultrametrics
into $\mathbb{R}^d$ with minimum distortion, where $\Delta$ denotes the spread
of the metric, i.e., the ratio between the largest and the smallest distance
between two points. The previously best-known approximation ratio for this
problem was polynomial in $n$. This is the first algorithm for embedding a
non-trivial family of weighted-graph metrics into a space of constant dimension

hierarchy is generated between these fermion families. Thus, the fermion mass
spectrum of the model presents a rough approximation to what is observed in
Nature. In the MCPM the couplings of the Higgs bosons to the fermions are
completely fixed. This allows us to present clear predictions for the
production at the LHC and for the decays of the physical Higgs bosons. As

derived separations of the binaries are smaller than 6 AU and consistent with
previous brown dwarf binary statistics. Their mass ratios of q > 0.8 confirm
the preference for equal mass systems similar to a large number of other

The resonance is between the moonlet underlying the propeller, and co-orbiting

librates within the gap about an equilibrium point established by co-orbiting
material and stabilized by the Coriolis force. In the limit of small libration
amplitude, the libration period scales linearly with the gap azimuthal width
and inversely as the square root of the co-orbital mass. The new resonance
recalls but is distinct from conventional horseshoe and tadpole orbits; we call
it the ""frog"" resonance, after the relevant term in equine hoof anatomy. For a
ring surface density and gap geometry appropriate for the propeller Bl\'eriot

to the ~3.7 year period over which Bl\'eriot's orbital longitude is observed to
vary. These librations should be subtracted from the longitude data before any

equivalent single perturbation simulation but eventually exhibits a higher
reconnection rate. The unobstructed outflow jets are faster and longer than the
outflow jets directed towards the magnetic island that forms between the two
current sheets. The X-line and flow stagnation point are located near the
trailing end of each current sheet very close to the obstructed exit. The speed
of X-line retreat ranges from ~0.02-0.06 while the speed of stagnation point
retreat ranges from ~0.03-0.07, in units of the initial upstream Alfven
velocity. Early in time, the flow stagnation point is located closer to the
center of the current sheet than the X-line, but later on the relative
positions of these two points switch. Consequently, late in time there is
significant plasma flow across the X-line in the opposite direction of X-line
retreat. Throughout the simulation, the velocity at the X-line does not equal
the velocity of the X-line. Motivated by these results, an expression for the
rate of X-line retreat is derived in terms of local parameters at the X-point.
This expression shows that X-line retreat is due to both advection by the bulk
plasma flow and diffusion of the normal component of the magnetic field.

gas and Coulomb drag (grains are expected to be photoelectrically charged) as
well as the Lorentz force and the electric force caused by the induction
electric field. We show that to zeroth order the combined effect of these
forces can be well described in the framework of the classical Stark problem:
particle motion in a Keplerian potential subject to an additional constant
force. Based on this analogy, we elucidate the circumstances in which the
motion becomes unbound, and show that under local ISM conditions dust grains
smaller than ~100 microns originating in the Oort Cloud (e.g. in collisions of
comets) beyond 10000 AU are ejected from the Solar System under the action of
the electric force. Orbital motion of larger, bound grains is described
analytically using the orbit-averaged Hamiltonian approach and consists of
orbital plane precession at a fixed semi-major axis, accompanied by the
periodic variations of the inclination and eccentricity (the latter may
approach unity in some cases). A more detailed analysis of the combined effect

from a noncommutative U(N) Yang-Mills theory on M, coupled to a triplet of
scalars in the adjoint of U(N). Employing the SU(2)-equivariant gauge field
constructed in arXiv:0905.2338, we perform the dimensional reduction of the
theory over the fuzzy sphere. The emergent model is a noncommutative U(1) gauge
theory coupled adjointly to a set of scalar fields. We study this model on the
Groenewald-Moyal plane and find that, in certain limits, it admits
noncommutative, non-BPS vortex as well as flux-tube (fluxon) solutions and
discuss some of their properties.

in a long-duration, global, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation of black hole
accretion. Such cycles had been seen previously in local shearing box
simulations, but we discuss their evolution over 1,500 inner disk orbits of a
global pi/4 disk wedge spanning two orders of magnitude in radius and seven
scale heights in elevation above/below the disk midplane. The observed cycles
manifest themselves as oscillations in azimuthal magnetic field occupying a
region that extends into a low-density corona several scale heights above the
disk. The cycle frequencies are ten to twenty times lower than the local
orbital frequency, making them potentially interesting sources of low-frequency
variability when scaled to real astrophysical systems. Furthermore, power
spectra derived from the full time series reveal that the cycles manifest
themselves at discrete, narrow-band frequencies that often share power across
broad radial ranges. We explore possible connections between these simulated
cycles and observed low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (LFQPOs) in
galactic black hole binary systems, finding that dynamo cycles have the
appropriate frequencies and are located in a spatial region associated with
X-ray emission in real systems. Derived observational proxies, however, fail to
feature peaks with RMS amplitudes comparable to LFQPO observations, suggesting
that further theoretical work and more sophisticated simulations will be
required to form a complete theory of dynamo-driven LFQPOs. Nonetheless, this
work clearly illustrates that global MHD dynamos exhibit quasi-periodic
behavior on timescales much longer than those derived from test particle
considerations.

in an extreme high-velocity quasar outflow (with v ~ -50000 km/s) is confirmed
by the line variability, broad smooth absorption profiles, and partial covering
of the background light source. HI and lower ionization metals are not clearly
present. The resolved OVI doublet indicates that these lines are moderately
saturated, with the absorber covering ~80% of the quasar continuum source
(C_f~0.8). We derive ionic column densities of order 1015 cm^(-2) in CIV and
several times larger in OVI, indicating an ionization parameter of log U >~
-0.5. Assuming solar abundances, we estimate a total column density of N(H) ~5
x 10^(19) cm^(-2). This outflow emerged sometime between 1982 and 1993. Our
examination of the CIV data from 1993 to 2007 shows that there is variable
complex absorption across a range of velocities from -45000 to -54000 km/s.
There is no clear evidence for acceleration or deceleration of the outflow gas.
Outflows are common in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), but extreme speeds such as
those reported here are extremely rare. It is not clear what properties of
PG0935+417 might produce this unusual outflow. In fact, PG0935+417 has
significantly less X-ray absorption than typical BAL quasars even though its
outflow has a degree of ionization typical of BALs at speeds that are 2-3 times
larger than most BALs. These results might present a challenge to theoretical
models that invoke strong radiative shielding in the X-rays/far-UV to moderate
the outflow ionization and thus enable its radiative acceleration to high
speeds.

LOG operates on generalized Fibonacci polynomials giving generalized Lucas
polynomials. The EXP is the inverse of LOG. In particular, LOG takes a
convolution product of generalized Fibonacci polynomials to a sum of
generalized Lucas polynomials and EXP takes the sum to the convolution product.
We use this structure to produce a theory of logarithms and exponentials within
arithmetic functions giving another proof of the fact that the group of
multiplicative functions under convolution product is isomorphic to the group
of additive functions under addition. The hyperbolic trigonometric functions
are constructed from the EXP operator, again, in the usual way. The usual
hyperbolic trigonometric identities hold. We exhibit new structure and
identities in the isobaric ring. Given a monic polynomial, its infinite
companion matrix can be embedded in the group of weighted isobaric polynomials.
The derivative of the monic polynomial and its companion matrix give us the
different matrix and the infinite different matrix. The determinant of the
different matrix is the discriminate of the monic polynomial up to sign. In
fact, the LOG operating on the infinite companion matrix is the infinite
different matrix. We prove that an arithmetic function is locally representable
if an only if it is a multiplicative function. An arithmetic function is both
locally and globally representable if it is trivially globally represented.

thousands of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) will be limited by spectroscopic
follow-up and must therefore rely on photometric identification, increasing the
chance that the sample is contaminated by Core Collapse Supernovae (CC SNe).
Bayesian methods for supernova cosmology can remove contamination bias while
maintaining high statistical precision but are sensitive to the choice of
parameterization of the contaminating distance distribution. We use simulations
to investigate the form of the contaminating distribution and its dependence on
the absolute magnitudes, light curve shapes, colors, extinction, and redshifts
of core collapse supernovae. We find that the CC luminosity function dominates
the distance distribution function, but its shape is increasingly distorted as
the redshift increases and more CC SNe fall below the survey magnitude limit.
The shapes and colors of the CC light curves generally shift the distance
distribution, and their effect on the CC distances is correlated. We compare
the simulated distances to the first year results of the SDSS-II SN survey and
find that the SDSS distance distributions can be reproduced with simulated CC
SNe that are ~1 mag fainter than the standard Richardson et al. (2002)
luminosity functions, which do not produce a good fit. To exploit the full
power of the Bayesian parameter estimation method, parameterization of the
contaminating distribution should be guided by the current knowledge of the CC
luminosity functions, coupled with the effects of the survey selection and
magnitude-limit, and allow for systematic shifts caused by the parameters of
the distance fit.

drag, which is prone to saturation: the asymptotic value reached by the
horseshoe drag depends on a balance between coorbital dynamics (which tends to
cancel out or saturate the torque) and diffusive processes (which tend to
restore the unperturbed disk profiles, thereby desaturating the torque). We
entertain here the question of this asymptotic value, and we derive torque
formulae which give the total torque as a function of the disk's viscosity and
thermal diffusivity. The horseshoe drag features two components: one which
scales with the vortensity gradient, and one which scales with the entropy
gradient, and which constitutes the most promising candidate for halting inward
type I migration. Our analysis, which is complemented by numerical simulations,
recovers characteristics already noted by numericists, namely that the viscous
timescale across the horseshoe region must be shorter than the libration time
in order to avoid saturation, and that, provided this condition is satisfied,
the entropy related part of the horseshoe drag remains large if the thermal
timescale is shorter than the libration time. Side results include a study of
the Lindblad torque as a function of thermal diffusivity, and a contribution to
the corotation torque arising from vortensity viscously created at the contact
discontinuities that appear at the horseshoe separatrices. For the convenience
of the reader mostly interested in the torque formulae, section 8 is

with the Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope and the Spitzer Space
Telescope were used to study the association with the detected X-ray emission
and to understand the structure of the SNR at differents wavelengths. Results.
The SNR shows an extended and arc-like internal structure in the X-ray band
with out a compact point-like source inside the remnant. We find a high column
density of NH in the range 2.5-3.5x1022 cm-2, which supports a relatively
distant location (d $\geq$ 9.7 kpc). The X-ray spectrum exhibits at least three
emission lines, indicating that the X-ray emission has a thin thermal plasma
origin, although a non-thermal contribution cannot be discarded. The spectra of
three different regions (north, center and south) are well represented by a
combination of a non-equilibrium ionization (PSHOCK) and a power-law (PL)
model. The mid-infrared observations show a bright filamentary structure along
the north-south direction coincident with the NW radio shell. This suggests
that Kes 17 is propagating in a non-uniform environment with high density and
that the shock front is interacting with several adjacent massive molecular
clouds. The good correspondence of radio and mid-infrared emissions suggests
that the filamentary features are caused by shock compression. The X-ray
characteristics and well-known radio parameters indicate that G304.6+0.1 is a
middle-aged SNR (2.8-6.4)x104 yr old and a new member of the recently proposed
group of mixed-morphology SNRs.

establish the true form of the metallicity gradient. We find no compelling
evidence that the gradient differs between Peimbert Types I and II, nor is
oxygen abundance related to the vertical distance from the galactic plane. Our
gradient agrees well with analogous results for H II regions but is steeper
than the one recently published by Stanghellini & Haywood (2010) over a similar
range in galactocentric distance. A second analysis using PN distances from a
different source implied a flatter gradient, and we suggest that we have
reached a confusion limit which can only be resolved with greatly improved
distance measurements and an understanding of the natural scatter in oxygen
abundances. Finally, a consideration of recently published chemical evolution
models of the Galactic disk suggests that reconciling the current range in
published oxygen gradients is necessary for adequately constraining parameters
such as the surface density threshold for star formation and the characteristic
timescale for disk formation.

spherically symmetric error distributions. We propose sub-harmonic priors which
arise as a class of mixtures of Zellner's g-priors for which the Bayes factors
are independent of the underlying error distribution, as long as it is in the
spherically symmetric class. Because of this invariance to spherically
symmetric error distribution, we refer to our method as a robust Bayesian
variable selection method. We demonstrate that our Bayes factors have model
selection consistency and are coherent. We also develop Laplace approximations
to Bayes factors for a number of recently studied mixtures of g-priors that
have recently appeared in the literature (including our own) for Gaussian
errors. These approximations, in each case, are given by the Gaussian Bayes
factor based on BIC times a simple rational function of the prior's
hyper-parameters and the R^2's for the respective models. We also extend model
selection consistency for several g-prior based Bayes factor methods for
Gaussian errors to the entire class of spherically symmetric error
distributions. Additionally we demonstrate that our class of sub-harmonic
priors are the only ones within a large class of mixtures of g-priors studied
in the literature which are robust in our sense. A simulation study and an
analysis of two real data sets indicates good performance of our robust Bayes
factors relative to BIC and to other mixture of g-prior based methods.

3489, and IC 5063 show rings and/or arm-like structures, bluer than the body of
the galaxy, suggesting the presence of recent star formation. Although seven of
our ETGs show shell systems in their optical image, only NGC 7135 displays
shells in the UV bands. We characterize the UV and optical surface brightness
profiles, along the major axis, using a Sersic law. The Sersic law exponent,
$n$, varies from 1 to 16 in the UV bands. S0 galaxies tend to have lower values
of $n$ ($\leq5$). The Sersic law exponent $n=4$ seems to be a watershed: ETGs
with $n>4$ tend to have [$\alpha$/Fe] greater than 0.15, implying a short
star-formation time scale. We find a significant correlation between the
FUV$-$NUV colour and central velocity dispersions $\sigma$, with the UV colours
getting bluer at larger $\sigma$. This trend is likely driven by a combined
effect of `downsizing' and of the mass-metallicity relation.

photons from massive stars and galaxies propagate through space, were
ubiquitous in the universe from its earliest times. The cosmic dark ages ended
with the formation of the first primeval stars and galaxies a few hundred Myr
after the Big Bang. Numerical simulations suggest that stars in this era were
very massive, 25 - 500 solar masses, with H II regions of up to 30,000
light-years in diameter. We present three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamical
calculations that reveal that the I-fronts of the first stars and galaxies were
prone to violent instabilities, enhancing the escape of UV photons into the
early intergalactic medium (IGM) and forming clumpy media in which supernovae
later exploded. The enrichment of such clumps with metals by the first
supernovae may have led to the prompt formation of a second generation of
low-mass stars, profoundly transforming the nature of the first protogalaxies.
Cosmological radiation hydrodynamics is unique because ionizing photons coupled
strongly to both gas flows and primordial chemistry at early epochs,
introducing a hierarchy of disparate characteristic timescales whose relative
magnitudes can vary greatly throughout a given calculation. We describe the
adaptive multistep integration scheme we have developed for the self-consistent
transport of both cosmological and galactic ionization fronts.

operator of photons in plasma acquires infrared singular terms at small photon
momentum and the screened potential drops down as a power of distance and even
has an oscillating behavior, similar to the Friedel oscillations in plasma with
degenerate fermions. The magnetic properties of the cosmological plasma with
condensed W-bosons are also discussed. It is shown that W-bosons condense in

parameters. A major difficulty in making best use of Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ)
and X-ray observations of clusters for cosmology is that using X-ray
observations it is difficult to measure the temperature distribution and
therefore determine the density distribution in individual clusters of galaxies
out to the virial radius. Observations with the new generation of SZ
instruments are a promising alternative approach. We use clusters of galaxies
drawn from high-resolution adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) cosmological
simulations to study how well we should be able to constrain the large-scale
distribution of the intra-cluster gas (ICG) in individual massive relaxed
clusters using AMiBA in its configuration with 13 1.2-m diameter dishes
(AMiBA13) along with X-ray observations. We show that non-isothermal beta
models provide a good description of the ICG in our simulated relaxed clusters.
We use simulated X-ray observations to estimate the quality of constraints on
the distribution of gas density, and simulated SZ visibilities (AMiBA13
observations) for constraints on the large-scale temperature distribution of
the ICG. We find that AMiBA13 visibilities should constrain the scale radius of
the temperature distribution to about 50% accuracy. We conclude that the
upgraded AMiBA, AMiBA13, should be a powerful instrument to constrain the
large-scale distribution of the ICG.

well as the energy conversion efficiency are obtained, and compared to the

accretion in a slowly rotating Kehagias-Sfetsos geometry in Ho\v{r}ava gravity
with the one of a slowly rotating Kerr black hole, we verify that the intensity
of the flux emerging from the disk surface is greater for the slowly rotating

Thus, distinct signatures appear in the electromagnetic spectrum, leading to

elastically anisotropic sphere embedded in an isotropic matrix. This has
important application to understanding the spectra of low-frequency Raman
scattering from nanoparticles embedded in a glass matrix. First some low
frequency vibrational modes of a free cubically elastic sphere are found to be
nearly independent of one combination of elastic constants. This is then
exploited to obtain an isotropic approximation for these modes which enables to
take into account the surrounding isotropic matrix. This method is then used to
quantatively explain recent spectra of gold and copper nanocrystals in glasses.

multi-wavelength observations. Observations include spectro-imaging with
XMM-Newton EPIC camera, multi-object spectroscopy (260 new redshifts), and
wide-field imaging at the ESO 3.6m and 2.2m telescopes. We build a global
picture of these clusters using X-ray luminosity and temperature maps together
with galaxy density and velocity distributions. Idealized numerical simulations
were used to constrain the merging scenario for each system. We show that A2933
is very likely an equal-mass advanced pre-merger ~ 200 Myr before the core
collapse, while A2440 and A2384 are post-merger systems ~ 450 Myr and ~1.5 Gyr
after core collapse, respectively). In the case of A2384, we detect a
spectacular filament of galaxies and gas spreading over more than 1 h^{-1} Mpc,
which we infer to have been stripped during the previous collision. The
analysis of the MUSIC sample allows us to outline some general properties of
merging clusters: a strong luminosity segregation of galaxies in recent
post-mergers; the existence of preferential axes --corresponding to the merging
directions-- along which the BCGs and structures on various scales are aligned;
the concomitance, in most major merger cases, of secondary merging or accretion
events, with groups infalling onto the main cluster, and in some cases the
evidence of previous merging episodes in one of the main components. These
results are in good agreement with the hierarchical scenario of structure
formation, in which clusters are expected to form by successive merging events,

the Sigma(H2) values are mostly within 10 to 40 M_solar pc^{-2}. The surface
density of gas and that of SFR correlate well at a 1-kpc resolution, but the
correlation becomes looser with higher resolution and breaks down at GMC
scales. The scatter of the Sigma(SFR)-Sigma(H2) relationship in the 80-pc

is attributed to the various evolutionary stages of GMCs and to the drift of
young clusters from their parent GMCs. This result shows that the

absorption of X-rays in the O star wind and occultation of the X-ray emitting
region by the massive star can alter the X-ray lightcurve and spectrum along
the orbit. Yet, the X-ray spectrum and lightcurve of LS 5039 do not show
intrinsic absorption or X-ray eclipses. We study these effects in the framework
of the pulsar wind scenario as a function of the binary inclination angle, the
stellar wind mass-loss rate and the size of the X-ray emitter. An extended
X-ray emission region >~ 3R_star appears necessary to reconcile the pulsar wind
scenario with observations.

Consecutive key face expressions in the database that are highly similar to the
query frame's face, then the key faces are used to generate the set of
retrieved video shots from the database. A concrete example of its application

ET will provide opportunities to test Einstein's theory of relativity in the
strong field and will realize precision gravitational wave astronomy with a
thousandfold increase in the expected number of events over the advanced
ground-based detectors. A design study for ET is currently underway, so it is
timely to assess the science that could be done with such an instrument. This
paper is the first in a series that will carry out a detailed study of
intermediate-mass-ratio inspirals (IMRIs) for ET. In the context of ET, an IMRI
is the inspiral of a neutron star or stellar-mass black hole into an
intermediate mass black hole (IMBH). In this paper we focus on the development
of IMRI waveform models for circular and equatorial inspirals. We consider two
approximations for the waveforms, which both incorporate the inspiral, merger
and ringdown phases in a consistent way. One approximation, valid for IMBHs of
arbitrary spin, uses the transition model of Ori and Thorne [1] to describe the
merger, and this is then matched smoothly onto a ringdown waveform. The second
approximation uses the Effective One Body (EOB) approach to model the merger
phase of the waveform and is valid for non-spinning IMBHs. In this paper, we
use both waveform models to compute signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) for IMRI
sources detectable by ET. At a redshift of z=1, we find typical SNRs for IMRI
systems with masses 1.4+100 solar masses, 10+100 solar masses, 1.4+500 solar
masses and 10+500 solar masses of about 10-25, 40-80, 3-15 and 10-60,

non-spinning inspirals that are consistent to about ten percent.

describe such systems. Here we present results of extensive simulations
designed to elucidate the microscopic basis underpinning macroscopic flow in

springs governed by rate-based rules for attachment, detachment and
unidirectional motion of motor heads along the filament contour. We
systematically vary motor density and speed, and uncover parameter regions
corresponding to unusual statics and dynamics which overlap but do not
coincide. The anomalous statics arise at high motor densities and take the form
of end-bound localized filament bundles for rapid motors, and extended clusters
exhibiting enhanced small-wavenumber density fluctuations and power-law
cluster-size distributions for slow, processive motors. Anomalous dynamics
arise for slow, processive motors over a range of motor densities, and are most
evident as superdiffusive mass transport, which we argue is the consequence of
a form of effective self-propulsion resulting from the polar coupling between

if polycrystalline rather than single crystalline materials can be actually
used. The aim of this study was therefore to verify whether polycrystalline Si
films deposited on top of a SiO$_2$ insulating layer can develop interesting
thermoelectric power factors. We prepared 450-nm thick heavily boron doped
polysilicon layers, setting the initial boron content in the film to be in
excess of the boron solubility in polycrystalline silicon at 1000 {\deg}C.
Isochronal thermal annealings were then used to modify the B$_{Si}$ content by
precipitation. Quite unexpectedly, a concurrent increase of the thermoelectric
power and of the conductivity was observed for heat treatments at temperatures
above 800 {\deg}C. Upon annealing at 1000 {\deg}C we found a power factor $P$
of 13 mW K$^{-2}$ m$^{-1}$, more than three times higher than previously
reported $P$ for Si nanowires. These findings could be explained observing that
degenerate polysilicon displays a remarkable enhancement of its Seebeck
coefficient as an effect of the large amount of boron it can dissolve. Band gap
narrowing and band tailing modify the density of states around the Fermi energy
leading to a dramatic improvement of its log-derivative in the Mott equation.
These results apparently point out an interesting direction for the development
of Seebeck and Peltier devices sharing low cost and relatively high efficiency.

the most important topics in computational logic and artificial intelligence.
Different ways to introduce non-monotonic aspects to classical logic have been
considered, e.g., extension with default rules, extension with modal belief
operators, or modification of the semantics. In this survey we consider a
logical formalism from each of the above possibilities, namely Reiter's default
logic, Moore's autoepistemic logic and McCarthy's circumscription.
Additionally, we consider abduction, where one is not interested in inferences
from a given knowledge base but in computing possible explanations for an
observation with respect to a given knowledge base.
  Complexity results for different reasoning tasks for propositional variants
of these logics have been studied already in the nineties. In recent years,
however, a renewed interest in complexity issues can be observed. One current
focal approach is to consider parameterized problems and identify reasonable
parameters that allow for FPT algorithms. In another approach, the emphasis
lies on identifying fragments, i.e., restriction of the logical language, that
allow more efficient algorithms for the most important reasoning tasks. In this
survey we focus on this second aspect. We describe complexity results for
fragments of logical languages obtained by either restricting the allowed set
of operators (e.g., forbidding negations one might consider only monotone
formulae) or by considering only formulae in conjunctive normal form but with
generalized clause types.
  The algorithmic problems we consider are suitable variants of satisfiability
and implication in each of the logics, but also counting problems, where one is
not only interested in the existence of certain objects (e.g., models of a
formula) but asks for their number.

describing radiation processes is an universal description which is gained by
the use of the end-point formulation. Hence, not only pure geomagnetic
radiation is simulated with REAS3 but also radiation due to the variation of
the net charge excess in the air shower, independent of the Earth's magnetic

Evershed flow along low-lying flow channels, which are cospatial with the

at the periphery of the sunspot as moving magnetic features in the sunspot
moat. Besides these well-ordered flows, peculiar motions are found in complex
sunspots, where they contribute to the build-up or relaxation of magnetic
shear. In principle, the three-dimensional structure of these velocity fields
can be captured. The line-of-sight component of the velocity vector is
accessible with spectroscopic measurements, whereas local correlation or
feature tracking techniques provide the means to assess horizontal proper
motions. The next generation of ground-based solar telescopes will provide

Lyot Telescope (Observatoire du Pic du Midi, France) to obtain a series of
Stokes I and Stokes V profiles for EK Boo. Using the Least Square Deconvolution
technique we were able to detect the Zeeman signature of the magnetic field. We
measured its longitudinal component by means of the averaged Stokes V and
Stokes I profiles. The spectra also permitted us to monitor the CaII K&H
chromospheric emission lines, which are well known as indicators of stellar
magnetic activity. From ten observations obtained between April 2008 and March
2009, we deduce that EK Boo has a magnetic field, which varied in the range of
-0.1 to -8 G. We also determined the initial mass and evolutionary stage of EK
Boo, based on up-to-date stellar evolution tracks. The initial mass is in the
range of 2.0-3.6 M_sun, and EK Boo is either on the asymptotic giant branch
(AGB), at the onset of the thermal pulse phase, or at the tip of the first (or
red) giant branch (RGB). The fast rotation and activity of EK Boo might be
explained by angular momentum dredge-up from the interior, or by the merging of
a binary. In addition, we observed eight other M giants, which are known as
X-ray emitters, or to be rotating fast for their class. For one of these, beta
And, presumably also an AGB star, we have a marginal detection of magnetic
field, and a longitudinal component Bl of about 1G was measured. More
observations like this will answer the question whether EK Boo is a special
case, or whether magnetic activity is, rather, more common among M giants than
expected.

the overdamped dynamics of self-assembling nanoscale components equipped with
strong, short-ranged and anisotropic interactions. Conventional Monte Carlo
simulations comprise sequential moves of single particles, proposed and
accepted so as to satisfy detailed balance. Under certain circumstances such
simulations provide an approximation of overdamped dynamics, but the accuracy
of this approximation can be poor if e.g. particle-particle interactions vary
strongly with distance or angle. The twin requirements of simulation efficiency
(trial moves of appreciable scale are needed to ensure reasonable sampling) and
dynamical fidelity (true in the limit of vanishingly small trial moves) then
become irreconcilable. As a result, single-particle moves can underrepresent
important collective modes of relaxation, such as self-diffusion of particle
clusters. However, one way of using Monte Carlo simulation to mimic real
collective modes of motion, retaining the ability to make trial moves of
reasonable scale, is to make explicit moves of collections of particles. We
will outline ways of doing so by iteratively linking particles to their
environment. Linking criteria can be static, conditioned upon properties of the
current state of a system, or dynamic, conditioned upon energy changes
resulting from trial virtual moves of particles. We argue that the latter
protocol is better-suited to approximating real dynamics.

  be published in Memorie della Societa Astronomica Italiana",,,,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The most puzzling aspect of the radio emission from LSI+61303 is that the
large periodic radio outburst, with period equal to the orbital one, occurs
very displaced from periastron passage, nearly at apoastron. In 1992, Taylor,
one of the discoverers of this source, together with his collaborators proposed
a model of a compact object in an eccentric orbit accreting from the equatorial
wind of the Be star primary. The application of this model by Marti & Paredes
(1995) predicts one ejection at periastron and a second more displaced ejection
along the orbit. The first ejection should correspond to weak radio emission,
because of strong inverse Compton losses of the emitting electrons due to the
proximity to the hot Be star, whereas the second ejection, quite displaced from
the star, would correspond to a strong radio outburst, that one indeed
observed. Corroborated along the years by numerical computations, simulations
and gamma-ray observations, until now this two-peak model could not be proved
in the radio band, because of the negligible emission around periastron. We
show here, that the radio spectral index based on the ratio of flux densities
is the unique tool to monitor activity of LSI+61303 in the radio band around
periastron. The analysis of the radio spectral index over almost 7 years of
Green Bank Interferometer data results in a clear double-peaked spectral index
curve along the orbit. This result gives finally observational support at
radiowavelengths to the two-peak accretion/ejection model for LSI+61303.
Moreover, the here shown comparison of the two-peak curves - the radio spectral
index curve and the Fermi-LAT gamma-ray curve - indicates a new interesting
hypothesis on the electron population responsible for the gamma-ray emission.

optical lattice and conclude that it is feasible to transport the atoms over 50

to reduce the contribution of the blackbody radiation to the fractional

lattice, including walks with a random coin, which is chosen from step to step
by a general Markov chain. In the unitary (i.e., non-random) case, we allow any
unitary operator, which commutes with translations, and couples only sites at a
finite distance from each other. For example, a single step of the walk could
be composed of any finite succession of different shift and coin operations in
the usual sense, with any lattice dimension and coin dimension. We find
ballistic scaling, and establish a direct method for computing the asymptotic
distribution of position divided by time, namely as the distribution of the
discrete time analog of the group velocity. In the random case, we let a Markov
chain (control process) pick in each step one of finitely many unitary walks,
in the sense described above. In ballistic order we find a non-random drift,
which depends only on the mean of the control process and not on the initial
state. In diffusive scaling the limiting distribution is asymptotically
Gaussian, with a covariance matrix (diffusion matrix) depending on momentum.
The diffusion matrix depends not only on the mean but also on the transition
rates of the control process. In the non-random limit, i.e., when the coins
chosen are all very close, or the transition rates of the control process are
small, leading to long intervals of ballistic evolution, the diffusion matrix
diverges. Our method is based on spatial Fourier transforms, and the first and
second order perturbation theory of the eigenvalue 1 of the transition operator
for each value of the momentum.

has also shown how to compute the lineage of a non-answer to a query. However,
the cause of an answer or non-answer is a more subtle notion and consists, in
general, of only a fragment of the lineage. In this paper, we adapt Halpern,
Pearl, and Chockler's recent definitions of causality and responsibility to
define the causes of answers and non-answers to queries, and their degree of
responsibility. Responsibility captures the notion of degree of causality and
serves to rank potentially many causes by their relative contributions to the
effect. Then, we study the complexity of computing causes and responsibilities
for conjunctive queries. It is known that computing causes is NP-complete in
general. Our first main result shows that all causes to conjunctive queries can
be computed by a relational query which may involve negation. Thus, causality
can be computed in PTIME, and very efficiently so. Next, we study computing
responsibility. Here, we prove that the complexity depends on the conjunctive
query and demonstrate a dichotomy between PTIME and NP-complete cases. For the
PTIME cases, we give a non-trivial algorithm, consisting of a reduction to the
max-flow computation problem. Finally, we prove that, even when it is in PTIME,
responsibility is complete for LOGSPACE, implying that, unlike causality, it

both zigzag interfaces are fully hydrogenated, the superlattice behaves like a

general expression for the thermal energy current is accomplished, in the form
of a generalized Landauer formula. In the harmonic limit this expression
reduces to the standard Landauer result for heat transfer, while in the
presence of nonlinearities multiphonon tunneling effects are realized.

theory and probability theory which is based on the algebraic approach to
integration, information geometry, and maximum relative entropy methods. It
enables us to deal with conceptual and mathematical problems of quantum theory
without any appeal to frameworks of Hilbert spaces and measure spaces.

resolved in all three spatial dimensions by piezoresponse force microscopy.
Their topology is dominated by electrostatic effects with a range of 100 unit
cells and reflects the unusual electrostatic origin of the spontaneous
polarization. The response of the domains to locally applied electric fields
explains difficulties in transferring YMnO$_3$ into a single-domain state. Our
results demonstrate that the wealth of non-displacive mechanisms driving
ferroelectricity that emerged from the research on multiferroics are a rich
source of alternative types of domains and domain-switching phenomena.
