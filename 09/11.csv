redshift (z \sim 0.2-0.6), with the IRAM 30m telescope, with the goal to follow
galaxy evolution and in particular the star formation efficiency (SFE) as
defined by the ratio between far-infrared luminosity and molecular gas mass
(LFIR/M(H2)). The sources are selected to be ultra-luminous infrared galaxies
(ULIRGs), with LFIR larger than 2.8 10^{12} Lsol, experiencing starbursts;
adopting a low ULIRG CO-to-H2 conversion factor, their gas consumption
time-scale is lower than 10^8 yr. To date only very few CO observations exist
in this redshift range that spans nearly 25% of the universe's age.
Considerable evolution of the star formation rate is already observed during
this period. 18 galaxies out of our sample of 30 are detected (of which 16 are
new detections), corresponding to a detection rate of 60%. The average CO
luminosity for the 18 galaxies detected is L'CO = 2 10^{10} K km/s pc^2,
corresponding to an average H2 mass of 1.6 10^{10} Msol. The FIR luminosity
correlates well with the CO luminosity, in agreement with the correlation found
for low and high redshift ULIRGs. Although the conversion factor between CO
luminosity and H2 mass is uncertain, we find that the maximum amount of gas
available for a single galaxy is quickly increasing as a function of redshift.
Using the same conversion factor, the SFEs for z\sim 0.2-0.6 ULIRGs are found
to be significantly higher, by a factor 3, than for local ULIRGs, and are
comparable to high redshift ones. We compare this evolution to the expected
cosmic H2 abundance and the cosmic star formation history.

beliefs of a knowledge base. He also showed how only-knowing can be used to
formalize non-monotonic behavior within a monotonic logic. Despite its appeal,
all attempts to extend only-knowing to the many agent case have undesirable
properties. A belief model by Halpern and Lakemeyer, for instance, appeals to
proof-theoretic constructs in the semantics and needs to axiomatize validity as
part of the logic. It is also not clear how to generalize their ideas to a
first-order case. In this paper, we propose a new account of multi-agent
only-knowing which, for the first time, has a natural possible-world semantics
for a quantified language with equality. We then provide, for the propositional

proof theory to the many agent case. We also discuss comparisons to the earlier

stellar clusters of modest population evolve very differently from the picture
presented by classical dynamical relaxation theory. The system's most massive
stars rapidly sink towards the center and form binary systems. These binaries
efficiently heat the cluster, reversing any incipient core contraction and
driving a subsequent phase of global expansion. Most previous theoretical
studies demonstrating deep and persistent dynamical relaxation have either
conflated the process with mass segregation, ignored three-body interactions,
or else adopted the artificial assumption that all cluster members are single
stars of identical mass. In such a uniform-mass cluster, binary formation is
greatly delayed, as we confirm here both numerically and analytically. The
relative duration of core contraction and global expansion is effected by
stellar evolution, which causes the most massive stars to die out before they
form binaries. In clusters of higher N, the epoch of dynamical relaxation lasts
for progressively longer periods. By extrapolating our results to much larger
populations, we can understand, at least qualitatively, why some globular
clusters reach the point of true core collapse.

evidence that most real-world complex systems are driven by a combination of
heterogeneous mechanisms that may collaboratively shape their ubiquitous

well correlated with nitrogen abundance, NH3360 is almost equally well
anti-correlated with Mg abundance. This prompts the definition of two new
indices, Mg3334, which is mostly sensitive to magnesium, and NH3375, which is
mostly sensitive to nitrogen. Rather surprisingly, we find that the new NH3375
index shows a trend versus optical absorption feature indices that is as
shallow as the NH3360 index. We hypothesize that the lack of a strong index
trend in these near-UV indices is due to the presence of an old metal-poor
component of the galactic population. Comparison of observed index trends and
those predicted by models shows that a modest fraction of an old, metal-poor
stellar population could easily account for the observed flat trend in these

contrast to previous results reported in optimally doped La1111 with Tc=28 K

almost vanishing hole FS through the heavily electron-overdoping. Our findings
strongly suggest that the sign reversal of the gap functions on the different
FSs, that is, s(+-)-wave state is realized in La1111 compounds. We remark that
interband scattering on well-nested FSs is essential for stabilizing the

conic formulation of the problem; second, determine its dual; third, apply
smoothing; and fourth, solve using an optimal first-order method. A merit of
this approach is its flexibility: for example, all compressed sensing problems
can be solved via this approach. These include models with objective
functionals such as the total-variation norm, ||Wx||_1 where W is arbitrary, or
a combination thereof. In addition, the paper also introduces a number of
technical contributions such as a novel continuation scheme, a novel approach
for controlling the step size, and some new results showing that the smooth and
unsmoothed problems are sometimes formally equivalent. Combined with our
framework, these lead to novel, stable and computationally efficient
algorithms. For instance, our general implementation is competitive with
state-of-the-art methods for solving intensively studied problems such as the
LASSO. Further, numerical experiments show that one can solve the Dantzig
selector problem, for which no efficient large-scale solvers exist, in a few
hundred iterations. Finally, the paper is accompanied with a software release.

curves of coronal loops and their associated magnetic topologies for NOAA
Active Region 10963. We examine loops that show both transient and steady
emission, and we find that loops that show many transient brightenings are
located in domains associated with a high number of separators. This topology
provides an environment for continual impulsive heating events through magnetic
reconnection at the separators. A loop with relatively constant X-ray and EUV
emission, on the other hand, is located in domains that are not associated with
separators. This result implies that larger-scale magnetic field reconnections
are not involved in heating plasma in these regions, and the heating in these
loops must come from another mechanism, such as small-scale reconnections
(i.e., nanoflares) or wave heating. Additionally, we find that loops that
undergo repeated transient brightenings are associated with separators that
have enhanced free energy. In contrast, we find one case of an isolated
transient brightening that seems to be associated with separators with a
smaller free energy.

also explain the anticorrelation of the electrons in the deep below

leads to the formation of protostellar disks that are more susceptible to
gravitational instability. Disk fragmentation occurs in most models but its
effect is often limited to the very early stage, with the fragments being
either dispersed or driven onto the forming star during tens of orbital
periods. Only cloud cores with high enough M_cl or \beta may eventually form
wide-separation binary/multiple systems with low mass ratios and brown dwarf or
sub-solar mass companions. It is feasible that such systems may eventually
break up, giving birth to rogue brown dwarfs. Protostellar disks of {\it equal}
age formed from cloud cores of greater mass (but equal \beta) are generally
denser, hotter, larger, and more massive. On the other hand, protostellar disks
formed from cloud cores of higher \beta (but equal M_cl) are generally thinner
and colder but larger and more massive. In all models, the difference between
the irradiation temperature and midplane temperature \triangle T is small,
except for the innermost regions of young disks, dense fragments, and disk's
outer edge where \triangle T is negative and may reach a factor of two or even
more. Gravitationally unstable, embedded disks show radial pulsations, the
amplitude of which increases along the line of increasing M_cl and \beta but
tends to diminish as the envelope clears. We find that single stars with a
disk-to-star mass ratio of order unity can be formed only from high-\beta cloud
cores, but such massive disks are unstable and quickly fragment into

in magnetic fields up to 60 T for a hole concentration p from 0.078 to 0.152,
in the underdoped regime. In fields large enough to suppress superconductivity,
R_H(T) is seen to go from positive at high temperature to negative at low
temperature, for p > 0.08. This change of sign is attributed to the emergence
of an electron pocket in the Fermi surface at low temperature. At p < 0.08, the
normal-state R_H(T) remains positive at all temperatures, increasing
monotonically as T \to 0. We attribute the change of behaviour across p = 0.08
to a Lifshitz transition, namely a change in Fermi-surface topology occurring
at a critical concentration p_L = 0.08, where the electron pocket vanishes. The
loss of the high-mobility electron pocket across p_L coincides with a ten-fold
drop in the conductivity at low temperature, revealed in measurements of the
electrical resistivity $\rho$ at high fields, showing that the so-called
metal-insulator crossover of cuprates is in fact driven by a Lifshitz
transition. It also coincides with a jump in the in-plane anisotropy of $\rho$,
showing that without its electron pocket the Fermi surface must have strong
two-fold in-plane anisotropy. These findings are consistent with a

investigated in the semiclassical regime. We consider a model of two particles,
initially prepared in a product of coherent states, evolving in time according
to a generic Hamiltonian, and derive a formula for the linear entropy of the
reduced density matrix using the semiclassical propagator in the coherent-state
representation. The formula is explicitly written in terms of quantities that
define the stability of classical trajectories of the underlying classical
system. The formalism is then applied to the problem of two nonlinearly coupled
harmonic oscillators and the result is shown to be in remarkable agreement with
the exact quantum measure of entanglement in the short-time regime. An
important byproduct of our approach is a unified semiclassical formula which
contemplates both the coherent-state propagator and its complex conjugate.

confirmed quasar sample, we demonstrate that variability selection in typical
extragalactic fields with low stellar density can deliver complete samples with
reasonable purity (or efficiency, E). Compared to a selection method based
solely on the slope of the structure function, the inclusion of the tau
information boosts E from 60% to 75% while maintaining a highly complete sample
(98%) even in the absence of color information. For a completeness of C=90%, E
is boosted from 80% to 85%. Conversely, C improves from 90% to 97% while
maintaining E=80% when imposing a lower limit on tau. With the aid of color
selection, the purity can be further boosted to 96%, with C= 93%. Hence,
selection methods based on variability will play an important role in the
selection of quasars with data provided by upcoming large sky surveys, such as
Pan-STARRS and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). For a typical
(simulated) LSST cadence over 10 years and a photometric accuracy of 0.03 mag
(achieved at i~22), C is expected to be 88% for a simple sample selection
criterion of tau>100 days. In summary, given an adequate survey cadence,
photometric variability provides an even better method than color selection for
separating quasars from stars.

star-formation efficiency which makes it a good laboratory to study the very
early stages of the star formation process. The Pipe Nebula is largely
filamentary, and appears to be threaded by a uniform magnetic field at scales
of few parsecs, perpendicular to its main axis. The field is only locally
perturbed in a few regions, such as the only active cluster forming core B59.
The aim of this study is to investigate primordial conditions in low-mass
pre-stellar cores and how they relate to the local magnetic field in the cloud.
We used the IRAM 30-m telescope to carry out a continuum and molecular survey
at 3 and 1 mm of early- and late-time molecules toward four selected starless
cores inside the Pipe Nebula. We found that the dust continuum emission maps
trace better the densest regions than previous 2MASS extinction maps, while
2MASS extinction maps trace better the diffuse gas. The properties of the cores
derived from dust emission show average radii of ~0.09 pc, densities of
~1.3x10^5 cm^-3, and core masses of ~2.5 M_sun. Our results confirm that the
Pipe Nebula starless cores studied are in a very early evolutionary stage, and
present a very young chemistry with different properties that allow us to
propose an evolutionary sequence. All of the cores present early-time molecular
emission, with CS detections toward all the sample. Two of them, Cores 40 and
109, present strong late-time molecular emission. There seems to be a
correlation between the chemical evolutionary stage of the cores and the local
magnetic properties that suggests that the evolution of the cores is ruled by a
local competition between the magnetic energy and other mechanisms, such as
turbulence.

  equation",,,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  L\'evy ratchets are minimal models of fluctuation-driven transport in the
presence of L\'evy noise and periodic external potentials with broken spatial
symmetry. In these systems, a net ratchet current can appear even in the
absence of time dependent perturbations, external tilting forces, or a bias in
the noise. The majority of studies on the interaction of L\'evy noise with
external potentials have assumed $\alpha$-stable L\'evy statistics in the
Langevin description, which in the continuum limit corresponds to the
fractional Fokker-Planck equation. However, the divergence of the low order
moments is a potential drawback of $\alpha$-stable distributions because, in
applications, the moments represent physical quantities. For example, for
$\alpha <1$, the current $J$, in $\alpha$-stable L\'evy ratchets is unbounded.
To overcome this limitation, we study ratchet transport using truncated L\'evy
distributions which in the continuum limit correspond to the spatially tempered
fractional Fokker-Planck equation. The main object of study is the dependence
of the ratchet current on the level of tempering, $\lambda$. For $\lambda \neq
0$, the statistics ultimately converges (although very slowly) to Gaussian
diffusion in the absence of a potential. However, it is shown here that in the
presence of a ratchet potential a finite current persists asymptotically for
any finite value of $\lambda$. The current converges exponentially in time to
the steady state value. The steady state current exhibits algebraically decay,
$J\sim \lambda^{-\zeta}$, for $\alpha \geq 1.75$. However, for $\alpha \leq
1.5$, the decay is exponential, $J \sim e^{-\xi \lambda}$. In the presence of a
bias in the L\'evy noise, it is shown that the tempering can lead to a current
reversal. A detailed numerical study is presented on the dependence of the
current on $\lambda$ and the physical parameters of the system.

natural way we consider the case where they are the Goldstone bosons of a
global symmetry group or are partially protected by an approximate
supersymmetry. We write the most general Lagrangian that couples the scalar
mode associated to the breaking of time translation during inflation to the
additional light scalar fields. This Lagrangian is constrained by
diffeomorphism invariance and the additional symmetries that keep the new
scalars light. This Lagrangian describes the fluctuations around the time of
horizon crossing and it is supplemented with a general parameterization
describing how the additional fluctuating fields can affect cosmological
perturbations. We find that multifield inflation can reproduce the
non-Gaussianities that can be generated in single field inflation but can also
give rise to new kinds of non-Gaussianities. We find several new three-point
function shapes. We show that in multifield inflation it is possible to
naturally suppress the three-point function making the four-point function the
leading source of detectable non-Gaussianities. We find that under certain
circumstances, i.e. if specific shapes of non-Gaussianities are detected in the

sometimes even among the various mechanisms that kept the additional fields

criticality with connectivity to cortical cytoskeleton. Our model is motivated
by recent observations of micron-sized critical fluctuations in plasma membrane
vesicles that are detached from their cortical cytoskeleton. We incorporate
criticality using a conserved order parameter Ising model coupled to a simple
actin cytoskeleton interacting through point-like pinning sites. Using this
minimal model, we recapitulate several experimental observations of plasma
membrane raft heterogeneity. Small (r~20nm) and dynamic fluctuations at
physiological temperatures arise from criticality. Including connectivity to
cortical cytoskeleton disrupts large fluctuations, prevents macroscopic phase
separation at low temperatures (T<=22{\deg}C), and provides a template for long
lived fluctuations at physiological temperature (T=37{\deg}C).
Cytoskeleton-stabilized fluctuations produce significant barriers to the
diffusion of some membrane components in a manner that is weakly dependent on
the number of pinning sites and strongly dependent on criticality. More
generally, we demonstrate that critical fluctuations provide a physical
mechanism to organize and spatially segregate membrane components by providing
channels for interaction over large distances.

that phase locking will always occur for sufficiently asymmetric shapes. We
characterize the effect of the geometry of the waveforms and the separation

work done by the swimmers is always minimized at the in-phase conformation. As
the swimmers get further apart, additional fixed points arise at intermediate

waves using the boundary integral method reveal that the two asymptotic limits
capture all the relevant physics of the problem. Our results provide a

the response of the system to a fictitious space and time dependent field,

superconductivity with unpaired electrons at the Fermi surface. The T=0 phase

couplings for the scalar and vector fields. We investigate static,
non-cylindrically symmetric solutions of the resulting field equations and
propose a pinch solution which interpolates between degenerate vacua along the
string, labelled by $\pm |n|$. This configuration corresponds to a vortex which
shrinks to Planck scale before re-emerging as an anti-vortex, resulting in the
formation of a bead pair with one bead at either side of the intersection. The
solution is then topologically stable. A key assumption is that quantities such
as phase and winding number, along with those which depend on them like the
magnetic flux, become undefined at the Planck scale so that regions of opposite
winding may be joined via a Planck-sized segment of neutral string.
Similarities between this solution and the extra-dimensional windings of
strings in type IIB string theory are discussed and a correspondence between
field theory and string theory parameters is suggested. The spatial-dependence
of the field couplings is found to have a natural interpretation in the dual
string picture and results from the variation of the winding radius, giving
rise to a varying (effective) string coupling. An interesting result is an
estimate of the Higgs mass (at critical coupling) in terms of the parameters
which define the Klebanov-Strassler geometry and which, in principle, may be
constrained by cosmological observations.

iteratively maximizing the (penalized) log-likelihood w.r.t. its Euclidean
parameter and functional nuisance parameter via Newton-Raphson algorithm. The
purpose of this paper is to provide a formula in calculating the minimal number
of iterations $k^\ast$ needed to produce an efficient estimate
$\hat\theta_n^{(k^\ast)}$ from a theoretical point of view. We discover that
(a) $k^\ast$ depends on the convergence rates of the initial estimate and
nuisance estimate; (b) more than $k^\ast$ iterations, i.e., $k$, will only
improve the higher order asymptotic efficiency of $\hat\theta_n^{(k)}$; (c)
$k^\ast$ iterations are also sufficient for recovering the estimation sparsity
in high dimensional data. These general conclusions hold, in particular, when
the nuisance parameter is not estimable at root-n rate, and apply to
semiparametric models estimated under various regularizations, e.g., kernel or
penalized estimation. This paper provides a first general theoretical
justification for the ""one-/two-step iteration"" phenomena observed in the
literature, and may be useful in reducing the bootstrap computational cost for
the semiparametric models.

observations, for direct comparison of the properties of galactic warps as a
function of wavelength, and calculate warp curves for each galaxy and obtain
the characteristic warp parameters. We discuss these properties as possible
constraints to the different mechanisms that have been proposed for the
development and persistence of galactic warps.
  Methods: We observed 20 galaxies that were selected from a statistically
complete diameter-limited subsample of edge-on disc galaxies. We used the Cerro

acquire the NIR data. We used the 1.54m Danish and 0.92m Dutch telescopes at

  Results: Our results show that 13 of our 20 sample galaxies are warped, with
the warp more pronounced in the optical than at NIR wavelengths. In the
remaining seven galaxies, no warp is apparent within the limitations of our
automated detection method. The transition between the unperturbed inner disc
and the outer, warped region is rather abrupt. S0 galaxies exhibit very small
or no warps. The magnetic model remains one of a number of interesting

we extend it to a presentation of the category of generalized Bott-Samelson

spin-split systems within a tight-binding single-band Hubbard model with
on-site and all nearest-neighbor matrix elements of the Coulomb interaction. By
Rashba-like systems we refer to the Dresselhaus and Rashba spin-orbit coupled
phases; spin-split systems have spin-up and spin-down Fermi surfaces shifted
relative to each other. Both systems break parity but preserve time-reversal
symmetry. They belong to a class of symmetry-breaking ground states that
satisfy: (i) electron crystal momentum is a good quantum number (ii) these
states have no net magnetic moment and (iii) their distribution of `polarized
spin' in momentum space breaks the lattice symmetry. In this class, the
relevant Coulomb matrix elements are found to be nearest-neighbor exchange $J$,
pair-hopping $J'$ and nearest-neighbor repulsion $V$. These ground states lower
their energy most effectively through $J$, hence we name them Class $J$ states.
The competing effects of $V-J'$ on the direct and exchange energies determine
the relative stability of Class $J$ states. We show that the spin-split and
Rashba-like phases are the most favored ground states within Class $J$ because
they have the minimum anisotropy in `polarized spin'. On a square lattice we
find that the spin-split phase is always favored for near-empty bands; above a
critical filling, we predict a transition from the paramagnetic to the
Rashba-like phase at $ J_{c1}$ and a second transition to the spin-split state
at $J_{c2}>J_{c1}$. An energetic comparison with ferromagnetism highlights the
importance of the role of $V$ in the stability of Class $J$ states. We discuss
the relevance of our results to (i) the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ phases proposed by
Wu and Zhang in the Fermi Liquid formalism and (ii) experimental observations
of spin-orbit splitting in \emph{Au}(111) surface states.

may be useful in IAEA reactor safeguards applications. We introduce a
hypothesis testing procedure to identify statistically significant differences
between the antineutrino count rate evolution of a standard 'baseline' fuel
cycle and that of an anomalous cycle, in which plutonium is removed and
replaced with an equivalent fissile worth of uranium. The test would allow an
inspector to detect anomalous reactor activity, or to positively confirm that
the reactor is operating in a manner consistent with its declared fuel
inventory and power level. We show that with a reasonable choice of detector
parameters, the test can detect replacement of 73 kg of plutonium in 90 days
with 95% probability, while controlling the false positive rate at 5%. We show
that some improvement on this level of sensitivity may be expected by various
means, including use of the method in conjunction with existing reactor
safeguards methods. We also identify a necessary and sufficient daily
antineutrino count rate to achieve the quoted sensitivity, and list examples of
detectors in which such rates have been attained.

derived using a detailed profile fitting of the Li I doublet at lambda 6708 A
in LTE. The planet hosting and comparison stars were chosen to have significant
overlap in their respective physical properties, including effective
temperatures, luminosities, masses, metallicities and ages. The combination of
uniform data and homogeneous analysis with well selected samples, makes this
study well-suited to probe for possible differences in the lithium abundances
found in planet hosting stars. An overall comparison between the two samples
reveals no obvious differences between stars with and without planets. Closer
examination of the behavior of the Li abundances over a narrow range of
effective temperature (5700 K < Teff < 5850 K) indicates subtle differences
between the two stellar samples; this temperature range is particularly
sensitive to various physical processes that can deplete lithium. In this Teff
range planet hosting stars have lower Li abundances (by ~0.26 dex on average)
than the comparison stars, although this segregation may be influenced by
combining stars from a range of ages, metallicities and masses. When stars with
very restricted ranges in metallicity ([Fe/H] = 0.00 to +0.20 dex) and mass (M

exhibit similar behaviors in the lithium abundance with stellar age, suggesting
that there are no differences in the lithium abundances between stars with

that the position measurements per each step with probability $p \sim
1/n^\beta$ can be evaluated, where $n$ is the final time and $0<\beta<1$. We
also give a corresponding continuous-time case. As a consequence, crossovers
from the diffusive spreading (random walk) to the ballistic spreading (quantum
walk) can be seen as the parameter $\beta$ shifts from 0 to 1 in both discrete-
and continuous-time cases of the weak convergence theorems. Secondly, we
introduce a new class of the DTQW, in which the absolute value of the diagonal
parts of the quantum coin is proportional to a power of the inverse of the
final time $n$. This is called a final-time-dependent DTQW (FTD-DTQW). The CTQW
is obtained in a limit of the FTD-DTQW. We also obtain the weak convergence
theorem for the FTD-DTQW which shows a variety of spreading properties.
Finally, we consider the FTD-DTQW with periodic position measurements. This
weak convergence theorem gives a phase diagram which maps sufficiently
long-time behaviors of the discrete- and continuous-time quantum and random

the density profile exhibits a wedding-cake shaped distribution with insulating

potential induces dissipationless circulation currents whose magnitudes and
chiralities vary with the distance from the trap center. In the insulating
regions the Hall conductances are quantized, and in the metallic regions the

disk formation in a strongly magnetized cloud. As the initial state, an
isolated cloud core embedded in a low-density interstellar medium with a
uniform magnetic field is adopted. The cloud evolution is calculated until
almost all gas inside the initial cloud falls onto either the circumstellar
disk or a protostar, and a part of the gas is ejected into the interstellar
medium by the protostellar outflow driven by the circumstellar disk. In the
early main accretion phase, the disk size is limited to \sim 10 AU because the
angular momentum of the circumstellar disk is effectively transferred by both
magnetic braking and the protostellar outflow. In the later main accretion
phase, however, the circumstellar disk grows rapidly and exceeds 100 AU by the
end of the main accretion phase. This rapid growth of the circumstellar disk is
caused by the depletion of the infalling envelope, while magnetic braking is
effective when the infalling envelope is more massive than the circumstellar
disk. The infalling envelope cannot brake the circumstellar disk when the
latter is more massive than the former. In addition, the protostellar outflow
weakens and disappears in the later main accretion phase, because the outflow
is powered by gas accretion onto the circumstellar disk. Although the
circumstellar disk formed in a magnetized cloud is considerably smaller than
that in an unmagnetized cloud, a circumstellar disk exceeding 100 AU can form
even in a strongly magnetized cloud.

polarization observed in some L dwarfs. Whether this polarization arises from
an inhomogeneous distribution of dust across the disk or an oblate shape
induced by rotation remains unclear. Here we argue that the latter case is
plausible and, for many L dwarfs, the more likely one. Furthermore evolutionary
models of mature field L dwarfs predict surface gravities ranging from about
200 to 2500 m/s^2 (corresponding to masses of about 15 to 70 times of Jupiter
mass). Yet comparison of observed spectra to available synthetic spectra often
does not permit more precise determination of the surface gravity of individual
field L dwarfs, leading to important uncertainties in their properties. Since
rotationally-induced non-sphericity, which gives rise to non-zero
disk-integrated polarization, is more pronounced at lower gravities,
polarization is a promising low gravity indicator. Here we combine a rigorous
multiple scattering analysis with a self-consistent cloudy atmospheric model
and observationally inferred rotational velocities and find that the observed
optical polarization can be explained if the surface gravity of the polarized
objects is about 300 m/s^2 or less, potentially providing a new method for
constraining L dwarf masses.

a function of the parameters describing the intrinsic shape and the

hints (>3sigma) of flares in the middle of October and November 2009, implies
that the emission is variable. The MAGIC results favour a scenario with the
very high energy emission originating from the inner jet close to the central
engine. More complicated models than a simple one-zone SSC scenario, e.g.
multi-zone SSC, external Compton or hadronic, may be required to explain the
very flat spectrum and its extension over more than three orders of magnitude
in energy.

a different meaning in each of general relativity and ordinary quantum theory.
This incompatibility creates serious problems with trying to replace these two
branches of physics with a single framework in regimes in which neither quantum
theory nor general relativity can be neglected, such as in black holes or in
the very early universe. Strategies for resolving the Problem of Time have
evolved somewhat since Kuchar and Isham's well-known reviews from the early
90's. These come in the following divisions I) time before quantization, such
as hidden time or matter time. II) Time after quantization, such as emergent
semiclassical time. III) Timeless strategies of Type 1: naive Schrodinger
interpretation, conditional probabilities interpretation and various forms of
records theories, and Type 2 `Rovelli': in terms of evolving constants of the
motion, complete observables and partial observables. IV) I argue for histories
theories to be a separate class of strategy. Additionally, various combinations
of these strategies have begun to appear in the literature; I discuss a number
of such. Finally, I comment on loop quantum gravity, supergravity and
string/M-theory from the problem of time perspective.

[1], we investigate here the final fate of a spherical distribution of a matter
cloud, where radial pressures vanish but tangential pressures are non-zero.
Within this framework, firstly we examine the effect of introducing a generic
small pressure in a well-known black hole formation process, which is that of
an otherwise pressure-free dust cloud. The intriguing result we find is that a
dust collapse that was going to a black hole final state could now go to a
naked singularity final configuration, when arbitrarily small tangential
pressures are introduced. The implications of such a scenario are discussed in
some detail. Secondly, the approach here allows us to generalize the earlier
results obtained on gravitational collapse with non-zero tangential pressure,
in the presence of a non-zero cosmological constant. Finally, we discuss the
genericity of black hole and naked singularity formation in collapse with
non-zero tangential pressure. The treatment here gives a unified and complete
picture on collapse final states, in terms of black hole and naked singularity
formation, generalizing the earlier results obtained for this class of collapse
models. Thus the role of tangential stresses towards determining collapse
endstates emerges in a straightforward and transparent manner in our treatment.

with emphasis on the detection of new states, in particular the search for
$J^{PC}$-exotic states and glueballs. We have collected data with 190 GeV/c
charged hadron beams on a liquid hydrogen and nuclear targets in 2008/09. The
spectrometer features good coverage by electromagnetic calorimetry and a RICH
detector further provides $\pi$ / $K$ separation, allowing for studying final
states involving neutral particles like $\pi^0$ or $\eta$ as well as hidden
strangeness, respectively. We discuss the status of ongoing analyses with
specific focus on diffractively produced $(\pi^0\pi^0\pi)^{-}$ as well as
$(K\bar{K}\pi)^{-}$ final states.

It makes use of typed existence properties between arguments of a predicate to
rewrite negative goals in a logic program. A typed existence property is a
generalization of functional dependencies in that an input value maps to a
fixed number of output values. Types are used to specify the domains of the
input and output values. An implementation of the simplification method is
presented and its complexity is analyzed. A key algorithm of the implementation
checks if an atom in a negative goal can be extracted using a given typed
existence property. A digraph links an atom to the quantified variables
occurring in the atom and is used to quickly retrieve atoms in the negative
goal that may become extractable after some other atom is extracted.

  JCAP","JCAP 1102:007,2011","10.1088/1475-7516/2011/02/007",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study dynamics of entropy perturbations in the two-field assisted dark
energy model. Based on the scenario of assisted dark energy, in which one
scalar field is subdominant compared with the other in the early epoch, we show
that the entropy perturbations in this two-field system tend to be constant on
large scales in the early epoch and hence survive until the present era for a
generic evolution of both fields during the radiation and matter eras. This
behaviour of the entropy perturbations is preserved even when the fields are
coupled via kinetic interaction. Since, for assisted dark energy, the
subdominant field in the early epoch becomes dominant at late time, the entropy
perturbations can significantly influence the dynamics of density perturbations
in the universe. Assuming correlations between the entropy and curvature
perturbations, the entropy perturbations can enhance the integrated Sachs-Wolfe
(ISW) effect if the signs of the contributions from entropy perturbations and
curvature perturbations are opposite after the matter era, otherwise the ISW
contribution is suppressed. For canonical scalar field the effect of entropy
perturbations on ISW effect is small because the initial value of the entropy
perturbations estimated during inflation cannot be sufficiently large. However,
in the case of k-essence, the initial value of the entropy perturbations can be
large enough to affect the ISW effect to leave a significant imprint on the CMB
power spectrum.

traffic in the district of Afogados, in the city of Recife, Brazil, with the
objective to verify whether the complexity of the underlying street grid, with
multiple lane streets, crossings, and semaphores, is capable of exhibiting the
effect of critical density: appearance of a maximum in the vehicle flux versus
density curve. Numerical simulations demonstrate that this effect indeed is
observed on individual avenues, while the phase offset among the avenues
results in damping of this effect for the region as a whole.

gravitational constant problem, which naturally implements the Dirac's large
numbers hypothesis in a new proposed holographic scenario for the origin of
gravity as an entropic force. We survey the effect of the Stochastic motion of
the test particle in Verlinde's scenario for gravity\cite{Verlinde}. Firstly we
show that we must get the equipartition values for $t\rightarrow\infty$ which
leads to the usual Newtonian gravitational constant. Secondly,the stochastic
(Brownian) essence of the motion of the test particle, modifies the Newton's
2'nd law. The direct result is that the Newtonian constant has been time
dependence in resemblance as \cite{Running}.

have strictly bounded rationality and where income allocation strategies evolve
through selective imitation. Income is calculated by a Cobb-Douglas type
production function, and selection of strategies for imitation depends on the
income growth rate they generate. We show that under these conditions, when an
agent adopts a new strategy, the effect on its income growth rate is
immediately visible to other agents, which allows a group of imitating agents
to quickly adapt their strategies when needed.
