the pressure range of 1 to 10 bar are investigated. The maximum charge gain
achieved in each pressure is approximately constant, around 4x10^2, for xenon
pressures up to 5 bar and decreasing slowly above this pressure down to values
somewhat above 10^2 at 10 bar. The MM presents the highest gains for xenon
pressures above 4 bar, when compared to other micropattern gaseous multipliers.
The lowest energy resolution obtained for X-rays of 22.1 keV exhibits a steady
increase with pressure, from 12% at 1bar to about 32% at 10 bar. The effective
scintillation yield, defined as the number of photons exiting through the MM
mesh holes per primary electron produced in the conversion region was
calculated. This yield is about 2x10^2 photons per primary electron at 1 bar,
increasing to about 6x10^2 at 5 bar and, then, decreasing again to 2x10^2 at 10
bar. The readout of this scintillation by a suitable photosensor will result in
higher gains but with increased statistical fluctuations.

displaying very cool temperatures (roughly 1000 Kelvins) as it faded. The
photometric behavior of M31-RV (and several other very red novae, i.e. luminous
eruptive red variables) has led to several models of this apparently new class
of astrophysical object. One of the most detailed models is that of
""mergebursts"": hypothetical mergers of close binary stars. These are predicted
to rival or exceed the brightest classical novae in luminosity, but to be much
cooler and redder than classical novae, and to become slowly hotter and bluer
as they age. This prediction suggests two stringent and definitive tests of the
mergeburst hypothesis. First, there should always be a cool red remnant, and
NOT a hot blue remnant at the site of such an outburst. Second, the inflated
envelope of a mergeburst event should be slowly contracting, hence it must
display a slowly rising effective temperature. We have located a luminous,
UV-bright object within 0.4 arcsec (1.5 sigma of the astrometric position) of
M31-RV in archival WFPC2 images taken 10 years after the outburst: it resembles
an old nova. Twenty years after the outburst, the object remains much too hot
to be a mergeburst. Its behavior remains consistent with that of theoretical
nova models which erupt on a low mass white dwarf. Future Hubble UV and visible
images could determine if the M31-RV analogs (in M85 and in M99) are also
behaving like old novae.

Doppler velocity maps of solar features. These velocity maps are created by
taking the difference between the blue- and red-wing intensity images of a
chosen spectral line. This method has the inherent assumption that these two
images are obtained under identical conditions. With the dynamical nature of
the solar features as well as the Earth's atmosphere, systematic errors can be
introduced in such measurements. In this paper, a quantitative estimate of the
errors introduced due to variable seeing conditions for ground-based
observations is simulated and compared with real observational data for
identifying their reliability. It is shown, under such conditions, that there
is a strong cross-talk from the total intensity to the velocity estimates.
These spurious velocities are larger in magnitude for the umbral regions
compared to the penumbra or quiet-sun regions surrounding the sunspots. The
variable seeing can induce spurious velocities up to about 1 km/s It is also
shown that adaptive optics, in general, helps in minimising this effect.

nurseries, but these potential sites for massive star formation are ``starless""

some interesting possibilities: some cold massive compact sources might never

not have an identifiable compact cold massive precursor.

familiar from symplectic geometry. For example, any 2-plectic manifold has a
Lie 2-algebra consisting of smooth functions and Hamiltonian 1-forms. This is
equipped with a Poisson-like bracket which only satisfies the Jacobi identity
up to `coherent chain homotopy'. Over any 2-plectic manifold is a vector bundle
equipped with extra structure called an exact Courant algebroid. This Courant
algebroid is the 2-plectic analogue of a transitive Lie algebroid over a
symplectic manifold. Its space of global sections also forms a Lie 2-algebra.
We show that this Lie 2-algebra contains an important sub-Lie 2-algebra which
is isomorphic to the Lie 2-algebra of Hamiltonian 1-forms. Furthermore, we
prove that it is quasi-isomorphic to a central extension of the (trivial) Lie
2-algebra of Hamiltonian vector fields, and therefore is the higher analogue of
the well-known Kostant-Souriau central extension in symplectic geometry. We
interpret all of these results within the context of a categorified
prequantization procedure for 2-plectic manifolds. In doing so, we describe how
U(1)-gerbes, equipped with a connection and curving, and Courant algebroids are

associated with rapidly expanding open magnetic fields and the acceleration of
the high-speed solar wind. During the years of the solar minima, coronal holes
are generally confined to the Sun's polar regions, while at solar maxima they
can also be found at lower latitudes. Waves, observed via remote sensing and
detected in-situ in the wind streams, are most likely responsible for the wind
and several theoretical models describe the role of MHD waves in the
acceleration of the fast solar wind. This paper reviews the observational
evidences of detection of propa- gating waves in these regions. The
characteristics of the waves, like periodicities, amplitude, speed provide
input parameters and also act as constraints on theoretical models of coronal
heating and solar wind acceleration.

traditional GUT scale at a mass M_32 by the inclusion of extra F-theory derived
heavy vectorlike multiplets. We demonstrate that simultaneous adherence to all
current experimental constraints, most importantly contributions to the muon
anomalous magnetic moment (g-2)_mu, the branching ratio limit on (b \to s
gamma), and the 7-year WMAP relic density measurement, dramatically reduces the
allowed solutions to a highly non-trivial ""golden strip"" with tan(beta) \sim
15, m_t = 173.0-174.4 GeV, M_1/2 = 455-481 GeV, and M_V = 691-1020 GeV,
effectively eliminating all extraneously tunable model parameters. We emphasize
that the consonance of the theoretically viable m_t range with the
experimentally established value is an independently correlated ""postdiction"".
The predicted range of M_V is testable at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The
partial lifetime for proton decay in the leading (e+|mu+) pi0 channels falls
around 4.6 X 10^34 Y, testable at the future DUSEL and Hyper-Kamiokande

  figures",,"10.1088/0004-637X/724/1/687",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we investigate the level of star formation activity within
nearby molecular clouds. We employ a uniform set of infrared extinction maps to
provide accurate assessments of cloud mass and structure and compare these with
inventories of young stellar objects within the clouds. We present evidence
indicating that both the yield and rate of star formation can vary considerably
in local clouds, independent of their mass and size. We find that the surface
density structure of such clouds appears to be important in controlling both
these factors. In particular, we find that the star formation rate (SFR) in
molecular clouds is linearly proportional to the cloud mass (M_{0.8}) above an
extinction threshold of A_K approximately equal to 0.8 magnitudes,
corresponding to a gas surface density threshold of approximaely 116 solar
masses per square pc. We argue that this surface density threshold corresponds
to a gas volume density threshold which we estimate to be n(H_2) approximately
equal to 10^4\cc. Specifically we find SFR (solar masses per yr) = 4.6 +/- 2.6
x 10^{-8} M_{0.8} (solar masses) for the clouds in our sample. This relation
between the rate of star formation and the amount of dense gas in molecular
clouds appears to be in excellent agreement with previous observations of both
galactic and extragalactic star forming activity. It is likely the underlying
physical relationship or empirical law that most directly connects star
formation activity with interstellar gas over many spatial scales within and
between individual galaxies. These results suggest that the key to obtaining a
predictive understanding of the star formation rates in molecular clouds and
galaxies is to understand those physical factors which give rise to the dense
components of these clouds.

  non-locality, and a full/empty waves model for entanglements","11 pages",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Whether the quantum mechanics (QM) is non-local is an issue disputed for a
long time. The violation of the Bell-type inequalities was considered as
proving this non-locality. However, these inequalities are constructed on a
class of local hidden variables, which obey the calculus with positive
probabilities. Such a calculus is rather suitable for billiard balls while the
QM deals with wave-packets of complex amplitudes. There is no wonder that a
calculus with positive numbers does not match a calculus with complex numbers.
The present text describes a different model of hidden variables for
entanglements, model that reproduces the quantum predictions in different
experiments, and also explains why the QM is nonlocal. The model deals with
waves, some of them full and the others empty, and the hidden variables mark
which waves are full. The basic physical concept with which the model operates
is joint amplitudes of probability, and not probabilities. The latter are a
secondary concept, the probability of a combination of results being equal to
the absolute square of sum of all the contributing joint amplitudes. Thus the
non-locality appears: a) a joint amplitude ignores distance, it handles distant
particles as if they were one single particle at one single place, b) joint
amplitudes are complex numbers and the sum of several contributions may vanish,
blocking the respective combination of wave-packets and therefore of results.
Although showing the success of the model, this text does not advocate for
full/empty waves. It is shown that this hypothesis works only as long as one
does not consider moving observers, and does not compare their conclusions. The
real purpose here is to point to a severe impasse: assuming the existence of a
preferred frame contradicts the theory of relativity, while refuting the
full/empty waves idea one runs into other insurmountable difficulties.

that the inner disk is at the innermost stable circular orbit, our blurred
reflection models give a spin of a = 0.7+/-0.1. The reflection component in
each spectrum is weaker than predicted by simple reflection models. If the
illuminating X-ray emission is produced by flares above the disk that move at
mildly relativistic velocities, however, diminished reflection is expected.

bottom-up approach, we consider different sensing, motion and cost models with
increasing levels of difficulty. At the first level, the sensing regions of the
different sensors do not overlap and the target is only observed within the
sensing range of an active sensor. Then, we consider sensors with overlapping
sensing range such that the tracking error, and hence the actions of the

redshift, radio-selected ULIRGs using deep observations obtained with SPIRE
from the Herschel Multi-tiered Extragalactic Survey (HerMES). These galaxies
span a large range of 850um fluxes from submillimetre-luminous ~10mJy ""SCUBA
galaxies -- SMGs"" to ~1.5mJy from stacked SCUBA non-detections, thus likely
representing a complete distribution of ULIRG spectral energy distributions.
From Keck spectroscopic surveys in the Lockman-North field we identified a
sample of 31 SMGs and 37 submillimetre-faint, optically-faint radio galaxies
(OFRGs), all with radio-inferred IR luminosities >10^12 Lsun. These galaxies
were cross-identified with SPIRE 250, 350 and 500um catalogs based on fluxes
extracted at 24um positions in the SWIRE survey, yielding a sample of more than
half of the galaxies well detected in at least two of the SPIRE bandpasses. By
fitting greybody dust models to the SPIRE photometry together with SCUBA 850um
measurements, we infer dust temperatures and far-infrared luminosities. The
OFRGs detected by SPIRE have median <T_d>= 41+-5 K and the SMGs have <T_d>=
34+-5 K, both in reasonable agreement with previous (pre-Herschel) estimates,

subset of high-z ULIRGs) at high redshift. Our observations firstly confirm
that a substantial fraction of OFRGs exhibit large infrared luminosities

the higher dust temperatures for these OFRGs than similarly selected SMGs,

form time series of outcomes. The frequencies of different outcomes are
compared with the probabilities provided by the algorithms of quantum theory
(QT). In spite of statistical predictions of QT a claim was made that the
theory provided the most complete description of the data and of the underlying
physical phenomena. This claim could be easily rejected if some fine
structures, averaged out in standard statistical descriptive analysis, were
found in the time series of experimental data. To search for these structures
one has to use more subtle statistical tools which were developed to study time
series produced by various stochastic processes. In this talk we review some of
these tools. As an example we show how the standard descriptive statistical
analysis of the data is unable to reveal a fine structure in a simulated sample
of AR(2) stochastic process. We emphasize once again that the violation of Bell
inequalities gives no information on the completeness or the non locality of
QT. The appropriate way to test the completeness of quantum theory is to search
for fine structures in time series of experimental data by means of the purity
tests or by studying the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions.

pair correlation functions of sphere packings and an upper bound on the maximal
density of infinite sphere packings. In R3, we find wide variability in the
densest local packings, including a multitude of packing symmetries such as
perfect tetrahedral and imperfect icosahedral symmetry. We compare the densest
local packings of N spheres near a central sphere to minimal-energy
configurations of N+1 points interacting with short-range repulsive and
long-range attractive pair potentials, e.g., 12-6 Lennard-Jones, and find that
they are in general completely different, a result that has possible
implications for nucleation theory. We also compare the densest local packings
to finite subsets of stacking variants of the densest infinite packings in R3

always most similar, as measured by a similarity metric, to the subsets of
Barlow packings with the smallest number of coordination shells measured about
a single central sphere, e.g., a subset of the FCC Barlow packing. We
additionally observe that the densest local packings are dominated by the

interaction driven, and UCDs are abundant in the cores of galaxy clusters,
environments that mark the end-point of galaxy evolution. Nothing is known
about the properties of UCDs in compact groups of galaxies, environments where
most of galaxy evolution and interaction is believed to occur and where UCDs in
intermediate state of evolution may be expected. The main goal of this study is
to detect and characterize, for the first time, the UCD population of compact
groups. For that, 2 groups in different evolutionary stages, HCG 22 and HCG 90,
were targeted with VLT/FORS2/MXU. We detect 16 and 5 objects belonging to HCG
22 and HCG 90, respectively, covering the magnitude range -10.0 > M_R > -11.5
mag. Their colours are consistent with old ages covering a broad range in
metallicities. Photometric mass estimates put 4 objects in HCG 90 and 9 in HCG
22 in the mass range of UCDs (>2x10^6 M_Sun) for an assumed age of 12 Gyr.
These UCDs are on average 2-3 times larger than typical Galactic GCs, covering
a range of 2 >~ r_h >~ 21 pc. The UCDs in HCG 22 are more concentrated around
the central galaxy than in HCG 90, at the 99% confidence level. They cover a
broad range in [alpha/Fe] abundances from sub- to super-solar. The spectra of 3
UCDs show tentative evidence for intermediate age stellar populations. We
calculate the specific frequency (S_N) of UCDs for both groups, finding that
HCG 22 has about three times higher S_N than HCG 90. The ensemble properties of
the detected UCDs supports 2 co-existing formation channels: a star cluster
origin and an origin as tidally stripped dwarf nuclei. Our results imply that
the UCDs detected in both groups do not, in their majority, originate from
relatively recent galaxy interactions. Most of the detected UCDs have likely
been brought into the group with their host galaxies.[abridged]

collisions and subsequent sticking due to surface forces. Results of many
fields of research involving circumstellar disks, such as radiative transfer
calculations, disk chemistry, magneto-hydrodynamic simulations largely depend
on the unknown grain size distribution.
  Aims. As detailed calculations of grain growth and fragmentation are both
numerically challenging and computationally expensive, we aim to find simple
recipes and analytical solutions for the grain size distribution in
circumstellar disks for a scenario in which grain growth is limited by
fragmentation and radial drift can be neglected.
  Methods. We generalize previous analytical work on self-similar steady-state
grain distributions. Numerical simulations are carried out to identify under
which conditions the grain size distributions can be understood in terms of a
combination of power-law distributions. A physically motivated fitting formula
for grain size distributions is derived using our analytical predictions and
numerical simulations.
  Results. We find good agreement between analytical results and numerical
solutions of the Smoluchowski equation for simple shapes of the kernel
function. The results for more complicated and realistic cases can be fitted
with a physically motivated ""black box"" recipe presented in this paper. Our
results show that the shape of the dust distribution is mostly dominated by the
gas surface density (not the dust-to-gas ratio), the turbulence strength and
the temperature and does not obey an MRN type distribution.

towards the open cluster Westerlund 2 has been re-observed, increasing the
total exposure to 45.9 h. The combined dataset includes 33 h of new data and
now permits a search for energy-dependent morphology and detailed spectroscopy.
Results. A new, hard spectrum VHE {\gamma}-ray source, HESSJ1026-582, was
discovered with a statistical significance of 7{\sigma}. It is positionally
coincident with the Fermi LAT pulsar PSR J1028-5819. The positional coincidence
and radio/{\gamma}-ray characteristics of the LAT pulsar favors a scenario

J1023-575 is discussed in light of the deep H.E.S.S. observations and recent

giant molecular clouds in the region. Despite the improved VHE dataset, a clear
identification of the object responsible for the VHE emission from HESS

of stars to expect a detection assuming the frequency of short-period giant

from the ensemble of open cluster surveys is inconsistent with expectations
from the field planet population. We select a subset of existing transit
surveys with well-defined selection criteria and quantified detection
efficiencies, and statistically combine their null results to show that the
upper limit on the planet fraction is 5.5% and 1.4% for 1.0 $R_{J}$ and 1.5

short-period giant planets around field stars in both radial velocity and

parallel chains and study the Renyi entanglement entropy $S_n$ between the two
chains. Here the entanglement cut is introduced between the chains, not along
the perpendicular direction as used in previous studies of one-dimensional
systems. The limit $n\to1$ corresponds to the von Neumann entanglement entropy.
The system is effectively described by two-component bosonic field theory with
different TLL parameters in the symmetric/antisymmetric channels as far as the
coupled system remains in a gapless phase. We argue that in this system, $S_n$
is a linear function of the length of the chains (boundary law) followed by a
universal subleading constant $\gamma_n$ determined by the ratio of the two TLL
parameters. The formulae of $\gamma_n$ for integer $n\ge 2$ are derived using
(a) ground-state wave functionals of TLLs and (b) boundary conformal field
theory, which lead to the same result. These predictions are checked in a
numerical diagonalization analysis of a hard-core bosonic model on a ladder.
Although the analytic continuation of $\gamma_n$ to $n\to 1$ turns out to be a
difficult problem, our numerical result suggests that the subleading constant
in the von Neumann entropy is also universal. Our results may provide useful
characterization of inherently anisotropic quantum phases such as the sliding
Luttinger liquid phase via qualitatively different behaviors of the
entanglement entropy with the entanglement partitions along different
directions.

stars. One of the more common ways of determining stellar characteristics from
these data is by so-called ""grid based"" modelling. We have made a detailed
study of grid-based analysis techniques to study the errors (and
error-correlations) involved. As had been reported earlier, we find that it is
relatively easy to get very precise values of stellar radii using grid-based
techniques. However, we find that there are small, but significant, biases that
can result because of the grid of models used. The biases can be minimized if
metallicity is known. Masses cannot be determined as precisely as the radii,
and suffer from larger systematic effects. We also find that the errors in mass
and radius are correlated. A positive consequence of this correlation is that
log g can be determined both precisely and accurately with almost no systematic
biases. Radii and log g can be determined with almost no model dependence to
within 5% for realistic estimates of error in asteroseismic and conventional
observations. Errors in mass can be somewhat higher unless accurate metallicity
estimates are available. Age estimates of individual stars are the most model
dependent. The errors are larger too. However, we find that for star-clusters,
it is possible to get a relatively precise age if one assumes that all stars in
a given cluster have the same age.

Phasing of the data yields a double-peaked lightcurve and indicates a nucleus
rotational period of 8.941 +/- 0.002 hr with a peak-to-peak amplitude of ~0.75

solutions as well as the single- and triple- peaked solutions. This rotation
period agrees with one of five possible solutions found in post-perihelion data
from 1994 by Mueller and Ferrin (1996, Icarus, 123, 463-477), and unambiguously
eliminates their remaining four solutions. We applied our same techniques to
published lightcurves from 1988 which were obtained at an equivalent orbital
position and viewing geometry as in 1999. We found a rotation period of 8.932

incompatible with our 1999 solution. This reveals that Tempel 2 spun-down by
~32 s between 1988 and 1999 (two intervening perihelion passages). If the
spin-down is due to a systematic torque, then the rotation period prior to

constructed from stacked optical to infrared photometry, of a sample of the
1,902 most UV-luminous star-forming galaxies found in 5.3 square degrees of the
NOAO Deep Wide-Field Survey. We bin the sample according to UV luminosity, and
find that the shape of the average SED in the rest-frame optical and infrared
is fairly constant with UV luminosity: i.e., more UV luminous galaxies are, on
average, also more luminous at longer wavelengths. In the rest-UV, however, the
spectral slope (measured at 0.13-0.28 um) rises steeply with the median UV
luminosity from -1.8 at L L* to -1.2 in the brightest bin (L~4-5L*). We use
population synthesis analyses to derive the average physical properties of
these galaxies and find that: (1) L_UV, and thus star formation rates (SFRs),
scale closely with stellar mass such that more UV-luminous galaxies are also
more massive; (2) The median ages indicate that the stellar populations are
relatively young (200-400 Myr) and show little correlation with UV luminosity;
and (3) More UV-luminous galaxies are dustier than their less-luminous
counterparts, such that L~4-5L* galaxies are extincted up to A(1600)=2 mag
while L L* galaxies have A(1600)=0.7-1.5 mag. Based on these observations, we
argue that the average star formation histories of UV-luminous galaxies are
better described by models in which SFR increases with time in order to
simultaneously reproduce the tight correlation between the observed SFR and
stellar mass, and the universally young ages of these galaxies. We demonstrate
the potential of measurements of the SFR-M* relation at multiple redshifts to
discriminate between simple models of star formation histories.

latter systems experience a higher level of dissipation than exoplanet host

paper proposes an image hashing method that is invariant under rotation,
scaling and translation of the image. The gist of our approach relies on the
geometric characterization of salient point distribution in the image. This is
achieved by the definition of a ""saliency graph"" connecting these points
jointly with an image intensity function on the graph nodes. An invariant hash
is then obtained by considering the spectrum of this function in the
eigenvector basis of the Laplacian graph, that is, its graph Fourier transform.
Interestingly, this spectrum is invariant under any relabeling of the graph
nodes. The graph reveals geometric information of the image, making the hash
robust to image transformation, yet distinct for different visual content. The
efficiency of the proposed method is assessed on a set of MRI 2-D slices and on
a database of faces.

main advantage of this model lies in the reduction of computational cost.
Nevertheless, up until now the degree of agreement with the original Hall MHD
system and the range of validity in a regime of turbulence was not established.
In this work direct numerical simulations of three-dimensional Hall MHD
turbulence in the presence of a strong mean magnetic field are compared with
simulations of the weak compressible RHMHD model. The results show that the
degree of agreement is very high (when the different assumptions of RHMHD, like
spectral anisotropy, are satisfied). Nevertheless, when the initial conditions
are isotropic but the mean magnetic field is maintained strong, the results
differ at the beginning but asymptotically reach a good agreement at relatively
short times. We also found evidence that the compressibility still plays a role
in the dynamics of these systems, and the weak compressible RHMHD model is able
to capture these effects. In conclusion the weak compressible RHMHD model is a
valid approximation of the Hall MHD turbulence in the relevant physical
context.

considered. A source and a destination intend to share secret information over

transmission through another Gaussian channel. Two constraints are imposed on
the source-to-destination channel; namely, the source can transmit only binary
phase shift keyed (BPSK) symbols, and symbol-by-symbol hard-decision
quantization is applied to the received symbols of the destination. An
error-free public channel is also available for the source and destination to

can perfectly observe all messages in the public channel. It is shown that a
secret sharing scheme that employs a random ensemble of regular low density

accommodate practical constraints of finite block length and limited decoding
complexity, fixed irregular LDPC codes are also designed to replace the regular

unitary representations of the Poincar\'e group, whereas the causal fields'
classification employs the finite dimensional (non-unitary) representations of
the (homogeneous) Lorentz group. A natural question arises - why the fields are
not allowed to transform nontrivially under translations? We investigate this
issue by considering the fields that transform under the full representation of
the Poincar\'e group. It follows that such fields can be consistently
constructed, although the Lagrangians that describe them necessarily exhibit
explicit dependence on the space-time coordinates. The two examples of the
Poincar\'e-spinor and the Poincar\'e-vector fields are considered in details.
The inclusion of Yang--Mills type interactions is considered on the simplest
example of the U(1) gauge theory. The generalization to the non-abelian case is
straightforward so long as the action of the gauge group on fields is
independent of the action of the Poincar\'e group. This is the case for all the
known interactions but gravity.

terrestrial fgravity is responsible for earth's trajectory. However its
correlation or geodesic deviation is manifested as semi-diurnal and diurnal
tides. Tidal signals, A(t) are temporal modulations in the field differential
which can be observed in a wide variety of natural and laboratory situations.
A(t) is a quasi-static, low frequency signal which arises from the relative
changes in positions of the detector and source and is not part of the
electromagnetic spectrum. Isaac Newton was the first to recognize the
importance of tides in astrometry and attempetd to estimate lunar mass from
ocean tides. By a case study we show, how the systematics of the gravitational
correlation can be used for calibration and de-trending which can significantly
increase the confidence level of high precision experiments. A(t) can also be
used to determine the distribution of celestial masses independently of the
""1-2-3"" law. Guided by modern advances in gravity wave detectors we argue that
it is important to develop high precision accelerometry. With a resolution of
about a nano-m it will be possible to determine solar system masses and detect
the SMBH at the center of our galaxy. Observations of the gravitational
correlation can potentially open up yet to be explored vistas of the cosmos.

exoplanets. In particular, we note that planets of Earth-size can give rise to
multi-magnitude eclipses of massive white dwarfs. Such a large signal is almost
unmistakable and would be detectable even with very low-precision photometry.
For objects of smaller size, the high accuracy photometry currently being used
to detect Super-Earth and smaller planets transiting Sun-sized stars, is
capable of revealing minor planets down to R~100km as they transit white
dwarfs. Such observations can be used to test current evidence for
asteroid-size objects being the cause for dust rings which have recently been

complete classical background for a new approach to relativistic quantum
theory. Here, we first show that there are two versions of Maxwell's equations.
The new version fixes the clock of the field source for all inertial observers.
However now, the (natural definition of the effective) speed of light is no
longer an invariant for all observers, but depends on the motion of the source.
This approach allows us to account for radiation reaction without the
Lorentz-Dirac equation, self-energy (divergence), advanced potentials or any
assumptions about the structure of the source. The theory provides a new
invariance group which, in general, is a nonlinear and nonlocal representation
of the Lorentz group. This approach also provides a natural (and unique)
definition of simultaneity for all observers. The corresponding particle theory
is independent of particle number, noninvariant under time reversal (arrow of
time), compatible with quantum mechanics and has a corresponding positive
definite canonical Hamiltonian associated with the clock of the source.
  We also provide a brief review of our work on the foundational aspects of the
corresponding relativistic quantum theory. Here, we show that the standard
square-root and the Dirac equations are actually two distinct

function of planet-star separation, metallicity, mass, and observed phase for

with 1x and 3x the solar abundance of heavy elements, and Neptune analogs with
10x and 30x. Our model planets orbit a solar analog parent star at separations
of 0.8 AU, 2 AU, 5 AU, and 10 AU. We use a radiative-convective model to
compute temperature-pressure profiles. The giant exoplanets are cloud-free at
0.8 AU, have H2O clouds at 2 AU, and have both NH3 and H2O clouds at 5 AU and
10 AU. For each model planet we compute moderate resolution spectra as a
function of phase. The presence and structure of clouds strongly influence the
spectra. Since the planet images will be unresolved, their phase may not be
obvious, and multiple observations will be needed to discriminate between the
effects of planet-star separation, metallicity, and phase. We consider the
range of these combined effects on spectra and colors. For example, we find
that the spectral influence of clouds depends more on planet-star separation
and hence temperature than metallicity, and it is easier to discriminate
between cloudy 1x and 3x Jupiters than between 10x and 30x Neptunes. In
addition to alkalis and methane, our Jupiter models show H2O absorption
features near 0.94 {\mu}m. We also predict that giant exoplanets receiving

illustrate that the TiZr alloy is rather ductile and its ductility is more
predominant than that of element Zr, especially in $\beta$ phase. Elastic wave

found that a soft-spring Duffing self-interaction enables a closer approach to
the displacement detection standard quantum limit, as well as cooling closer to
the ground state. Next, we make use of a superconducting transmission line
formed from an array of dc-SQUIDs for investigating analogue Hawking radiation.
Biasing the array with a space-time varying flux modifies the propagation
velocity of the transmission line, leading to an effective metric with a
horizon. This setup allows for quantum effects such as backreaction and
analogue space-time fluctuations on the Hawking process. Finally, we look at a
quantum parametric amplifier with dynamical pump mode, viewed as a
zero-dimensional model of Hawking radiation from an evaporating black hole. The
conditions are derived under which the spectrum of particles generated from
vacuum fluctuations deviates from the thermal spectrum predicted for the
conventional parametric amplifier. We find that significant deviation occurs
once the pump mode (black hole) has released nearly half of its initial energy
in the signal (Hawking radiation) and idler (in-falling particle) modes. As a
model of black hole dynamics, this finding lends support to the view that
late-time Hawking radiation contains information about the quantum state of the
black hole and is entangled with the black hole's quantum gravitational degrees
of freedom.

interface and at the acetonitrile-silica (LS) interface are studied by means of
molecular dynamics simulations. We set up the interfacial system and treat the
long-ranged electrostatics carefully to obtain both stable LV and LS interfaces
within the same system. Single molecule (singlet) and correlated density
orientational profiles and singlet and collective reorientational dynamics are
reported for both interfaces. At the LS interface acetonitrile forms layers.
The closest sublayer is dominated by nitrogen atoms bonding to the hydrogen
sites of the silica surface. The singlet molecular reorientation is strongly
hindered when close to the silica surface, but at the LV interface it relaxes
much faster than in the bulk. Antiparallel correlations between acetonitrile
molecules at the LV interface are even stronger than in the bulk liquid phase.
This strong antiparallel correlation disappears at the LS interface. The
collective reorientational relaxation of the first layer acetonitrile is much
faster than the singlet reorientational relaxation but it is still slower than
in the bulk. These results are interpreted with reference to a variety of
recent experiments.
  We found that defining interface properties based on the distribution of
positions of different choices of atoms or sites within the molecule leads to
apparently different orientational profiles, especially at the LV interface. We
provide a general formulation showing that this ambiguity arises when the size
of the molecule is comparable to the interfacial width and is particularly
significant when there is a large difference in density at the upper and lower
boundaries of the interface. We finally analyze the effect of electrostatics to
show the necessity of properly treating long-ranged electrostatics for
simulations of interfacial systems.

initial step of dust evolution in protoplanetary disks. Recently, it has been
pointed out that negative charging of dust in the weakly ionized disks could
significantly slow down the coagulation process. In this paper, we apply the
growth criteria obtained in Paper I to finding out a location (""frozen"" zone)
where the charging stalls dust growth at the fractal growth stage. For
low-turbulence disks, we find that the frozen zone can cover the major part of
the disks at a few to 100 AU from the central star. The maximum mass of the
aggregates is approximately 10^{-7} g at 1 AU and as small as a few monomer
masses at 100 AU. Strong turbulence can significantly reduce the size of the
frozen zone, but such turbulence will cause the fragmentation of macroscopic
aggregates at later stages. We examine a possibility that complete freezeout of
dust evolution in low-turbulence disks could be prevented by global transport
of dust in the disks. Our simple estimation shows that global dust transport
can lead to the supply of macroscopic aggregates and the removal of frozen
aggregates on a timescale of 10^6 yr. This overturns the usual understanding
that tiny dust particles get depleted on much shorter timescales unless
collisional fragmentation is effective. The frozen zone together with global
dust transport might explain ""slow"" (\sim 10^6 yr) dust evolution suggested by
infrared observation of T Tauri stars and by radioactive dating of chondrites.

very different properties to stellar binaries. This has led to the suggestion
that VLMBs form a distinct and different population. As most stars are born in
clusters, dynamical evolution can significantly alter any initial binary
population, preferentially destroying wide binaries. In this paper we examine
the dynamical evolution of initially different VLMB distributions in clusters
to investigate how different the initial and final distributions can be.
  We find that the majority of the observed VLMB systems, which have
separations <20 au, cannot be destroyed in even the densest clusters.
Therefore, the distribution of VLMBs with separations <20 au now must have been
the birth population (although we note that the observations of this population
may be very incomplete). Most VLMBs with separations >100 au can be destroyed
in high-density clusters, but are mainly unaffected in low-density clusters.
Therefore, the initial VLMB population must contain many more binaries with
these separations than now, or such systems must be made by capture during
cluster dissolution. M-dwarf binaries are processed in the same way as VLMBs
and so the difference in the current field populations either points to
fundamentally different birth populations, or significant observational
incompleteness in one or both samples.

coupling strength. The Wigner states exhibit non-trivial geometries due to the
anisotropy of the interaction. This leads to transitions between different
Wigner states as the tilt angle of the dipoles with the confining plane is
changed. Intriguingly, while the individual Wigner states are well described by
a classical analysis, the transitions between different Wigner states are
strongly affected by quantum statistics. This can be understood by considering
the interplay between quantum-mechanical and spatial symmetry properties.
Finally, we demonstrate that our results are relevant to experimentally
realistic systems.

The predictions of the ellipticity of the dark matter halos from models
of structure formation are notoriously difficult to test with observations. A
direct measurement would give important constraints on the formation of
galaxies, and its effect on the dark matter distribution in their halos. Here
we show that galaxy-galaxy flexion provides a direct and potentially powerful
method for determining the ellipticity of (an ensemble of) elliptical lenses.
Methods. We decompose the spin-1 flexion into a radial and a tangential
component. Using the ratio of tangential-to- radial flexion, which is
independent of the radial mass profile, the mass ellipticity can be estimated.
Results. An estimator for the ellipticity of the mass distribution is derived
and tested with simulations. We show that the estimator is slightly biased. We
quantify this bias, and provide a method to reduce it. Furthermore, a
parametric fitting of the flexion ratio and orientation provides another
estimate for the dark halo ellipticity, which is more accurate for individual
lenses Overall, galaxy-galaxy flexion appears as a powerful tool for
constraining the ellipticity of mass distributions.

fact that the outbursting star is in the middle of an old planetary nebula and
that the ejecta associated with the outburst is hydrogen deficient supports
this diagnosis. However, the material ejected during that outburst is also
extremely neon rich, suggesting that it derives from an oxygen-neon-magnesium
star, as is the case in the so-called neon novae. We have therefore attempted
to construct a scenario that explains all the observations of the nebula and
its central star, including the ejecta abundances. We find two scenarios that
have the potential to explain the observations, although neither is a perfect
match. The first scenario invokes the merger of a main sequence star and a
massive oxygen-neon-magnesium white dwarf. The second invokes an
oxygen-neon-magnesium classical nova that takes place shortly after a final
helium shell flash. The main drawback of the first scenario is the inability to
determine whether the ejecta would have the observed composition and whether a
merger could result in the observed hydrogen-deficient stellar abundances
observed in the star today. The second scenario is based on better understood
physics, but, through a population synthesis technique, we determine that its
frequency of occurrence should be very low and possibly lower than what is
implied by the number of observed systems. While we could not envisage a
scenario that naturally explains this object, this is the second final flash
star which, upon closer scrutiny, is found to have hydrogen-deficient ejecta
with abnormally high neon abundances. These findings are in stark contrast with
the predictions of the final helium shell flash and beg for an alternative
explanation.

signal quantization. However, it has been shown that scalar quantization of
oversampled or Compressively Sensed signals can be inefficient in terms of the
rate-distortion trade-off, especially as the oversampling rate or the sparsity
of the signal increases. In this paper, we modify the scalar quantizer to have
discontinuous quantization regions. We demonstrate that with this modification
it is possible to achieve exponential decay of the quantization error as a
function of the oversampling rate instead of the quadratic decay exhibited by
current approaches. Our approach is universal in the sense that prior knowledge
of the signal model is not necessary in the quantizer design, only in the
reconstruction. Thus, we demonstrate that it is possible to reduce the
quantization error by incorporating side information on the acquired signal,
such as sparse signal models or signal similarity with known signals. In doing
so, we establish a relationship between quantization performance and the
Kolmogorov entropy of the signal model.

expressed, the Cad system counteracts the elevated H+ concentration by
converting lysine to cadaverine under the consumption of H+, and exporting
cadaverine in exchange for external lysine. Surprisingly, the cad operon
displays a transient response, even when the conditions for its induction
persist. To quantitatively characterize the regulation of the Cad module, we
have experimentally recorded and theoretically modeled the dynamics of
important system variables. We establish a quantitative model that adequately
describes and predicts the transient expression behavior for various initial
conditions. Our quantitative analysis of the Cad system supports a negative
feedback by external cadaverine as the origin of the transient response.
Furthermore, the analysis puts causal constraints on the precise mechanism of
signal transduction via the regulatory protein CadC.

process in individual cells, focusing on the dynamics of the transition from
the OFF to the ON state. Using quantitative time-lapse microscopy, we determine
the time delay between inducer addition and fluorescence onset of a GFP

we can separate the lag time caused by the reporter from the intrinsic

propose that Anx A2t binds in a side-by-side configuration, i.e., both Anx A2
monomers bind to the bilayer with the p11 dimer positioned on top. Furthermore,
we observe a strong decrease of lipid mobility upon binding of Anx A2t to SLBs
with varying POPS content. X-ray reflectivity measurements indicate that
binding of Anx A2t also increases the density of the SLB. Interestingly, in the
protein-facing leaflet of the SLB the lipid density is higher than in the
substrate-facing leaflet. This asymmetric densification of the lipid bilayer by

that an asleep sensor cannot be communicated with or woken up, and hence the
sleep duration needs to be determined at the time the sensor goes to sleep
based on all the information available to the sensor. Having sleeping sensors
in the network could result in degraded tracking performance, therefore, there
is a tradeoff between energy usage and tracking performance. We design sleeping
policies that attempt to optimize this tradeoff and characterize their
performance. As an extension to our previous work in this area [1], we consider
generalized models for object movement, object sensing, and tracking cost. For
discrete state spaces and continuous Gaussian observations, we derive a lower

the two networks in a such a way that the mutually dependent nodes have the
same number of connectivity links, i.e. their degrees coincide. This implies
that both networks have the same degree distribution $P(k)$. We call such
networks correspondently coupled networks (CCN). We assume that the nodes in
each network are randomly connected. We define the mutually connected clusters
and the mutual giant component as in earlier works on randomly coupled
interdependent networks and assume that only the nodes which belong to the
mutual giant component remain functional. We assume that initially a $1-p$
fraction of nodes are randomly removed due to an attack or failure and find
analytically, for an arbitrary $P(k)$, the fraction of nodes $\mu(p)$ which
belong to the mutual giant component. We find that the system undergoes a
percolation transition at certain fraction $p=p_c$ which is always smaller than
the $p_c$ for randomly coupled networks with the same $P(k)$. We also find that
the system undergoes a first order transition at $p_c>0$ if $P(k)$ has a finite
second moment. For the case of scale free networks with $2<\lambda \leq 3$, the
transition becomes a second order transition. Moreover, if $\lambda<3$ we find

studied in the statistics community under the name of group testing. It
involves grouping subsets of items into different pools and detecting defective
members based on the set of test results obtained for each pool.
  In a classical noiseless group testing setup, it is assumed that the sampling
procedure is fully known to the reconstruction algorithm, in the sense that the
existence of a defective member in a pool results in the test outcome of that
pool to be positive. However, this may not be always a valid assumption in some
cases of interest. In particular, we consider the case where the defective
items in a pool can become independently inactive with a certain probability.
Hence, one may obtain a negative test result in a pool despite containing some
defective items. As a result, any sampling and reconstruction method should be
able to cope with two different types of uncertainty, i.e., the unknown set of
defective items and the partially unknown, probabilistic testing procedure.
  In this work, motivated by the application of detecting infected people in
viral epidemics, we design non-adaptive sampling procedures that allow
successful identification of the defective items through a set of probabilistic
tests. Our design requires only a small number of tests to single out the
defective items. In particular, for a population of size $N$ and at most $K$
defective items with activation probability $p$, our results show that $M =
O(K^2\log{(N/K)}/p^3)$ tests is sufficient if the sampling procedure should
work for all possible sets of defective items, while $M = O(K\log{(N)}/p^3)$
tests is enough to be successful for any single set of defective items.
Moreover, we show that the defective members can be recovered using a simple
reconstruction algorithm with complexity of $O(MN)$.

redshift range of 0.4 < z < 1 based on data from the POWIR near infrared
imaging and DEEP2 spectroscopic redshift surveys, down to a stellar mass of log
M* = 10.25 M_sun. Galaxy environments are measured in terms of nearest
neighbour densities as well as fixed aperture densities and kinematical and
dynamical parameters of neighbour galaxies within a radius of 1 Mpc. We
disentangle the correlations between galaxy stellar mass, galaxy colour and
galaxy environment, using not only galaxy number densities, but also other
environmental characteristics such as velocity dispersion, mean harmonic
radius, and crossing time. We find that galaxy colour and the fraction of blue
galaxies depends very strongly on stellar mass at 0.4 < z < 1, while a weak
additional dependence on local number densities is in place at lower redshifts
(0.4 < z < 0.7). This environmental influence is most visible in the colours of
intermediate mass galaxies (10.5 < log M* < 11), whereas colours of lower and
higher mass galaxies remain largely unchanged with redshift and environment. At
a fixed stellar mass, the colour-density relation almost disappears, while the
colour-stellar mass relation is present at all local densities. We find a weak
correlation between stellar mass and environment at intermediate redshifts,
which contributes to the overall colour-density relation. We furthermore do not
find a significant correlation between galaxy colour and virial mass, i.e.,
parent dark matter halo mass. Galaxy stellar mass thus appears to be the
crucial defining parameter for intrinsic galaxy properties such as ongoing star
formation and colour.

population of stars hotter and fainter than the hot end of the horizontal
branch (HB), the so-called blue hook stars. This feature might be explained
either by the late hot flasher scenario where stars experience the helium flash
while on the white dwarf cooling curve or by the progeny of the helium-enriched
sub-population postulated to exist in some clusters. Previous spectroscopic
analyses of blue hook stars in omega Cen and NGC 2808 support the late hot
flasher scenario, but the stars contain much less helium than expected and the
predicted C and N enrichment cannot be verified. We compare the observed
effective temperatures, surface gravities, helium abundances, and carbon line
strengths (where detectable) of our targets stars with the predictions of the
two aforementioned scenarios. Moderately high resolution spectra of hot HB
stars in the globular cluster omega Cen were analysed for radial velocity
variations, atmospheric parameters, and abundances using LTE and non-LTE model
atmospheres. We find no evidence of close binaries among our target stars. All
stars below 30,000K are helium-poor and very similar to HB stars observed in
that temperature range in other globular clusters. In the temperature range
30,000K to 50,000K, we find that 28% of our stars are helium-poor (log(He/H) <
-1.6), while 72% have roughly solar or super-solar helium abundance (log(He/H)
>= -1.5). We also find that carbon enrichment is strongly correlated with
helium enrichment, with a maximum carbon enrichment of 3% by mass. A strong
carbon enrichment in tandem with helium enrichment is predicted by the late hot
flasher scenario, but not by the helium-enrichment scenario. We conclude that
the helium-rich HB stars in omega Cen cannot be explained solely by the
helium-enrichment scenario invoked to explain the blue main sequence.

is the first step of planet formation in protoplanetary disks. These grains are
expected to carry nonzero negative charges in the weakly ionized disks, but its
effect on their collisional growth has not been fully understood so far. In
this paper, we investigate how the charging affects the evolution of the dust
size distribution properly taking into account the charging mechanism in a
weakly ionized gas as well as porosity evolution through low-energy collisions.
To clarify the role of the size distribution, we divide our analysis into two
steps. First, we analyze the collisional growth of charged aggregates assuming
a monodisperse (i.e., narrow) size distribution. We show that the monodisperse
growth stalls due to the electrostatic repulsion when a certain condition is
met, as is already expected in the previous work. Second, we numerically
simulate dust coagulation using Smoluchowski's method to see how the outcome
changes when the size distribution is allowed to freely evolve. We find that,
under certain conditions, the dust undergoes bimodal growth where only a
limited number of aggregates continue to grow carrying the major part of the
dust mass in the system. This occurs because remaining small aggregates
efficiently sweep up free electrons to prevent the larger aggregates from being
strongly charged. We obtain a set of simple criteria that allows us to predict
how the size distribution evolves for a given condition. In Paper II
(arXiv:1009.3101), we apply these criteria to dust growth in protoplanetary
disks.

the extent to which the upcoming observations by a high-angular resolution
experiment of CMB and deep galaxy imaging survey can tightly constrain the
neutrino mass and dark energy equation-of-state parameters. Including the
primary CMB information as a prior cosmological information, the Fisher
analysis reveals that the time varying equation-of-state parameters, given by
w(a)=w_0+w_a(1-a), can be tightly constrained with the accuracies of 5% for w_0
and 15% for w_a, which are comparable to or even better than those of the
stage-III type surveys neglecting the effect of massive neutrinos. In other
words, including the neutrino mass in the parameter estimation would not
drastically alter the Figure-of-Merit estimates of dark energy parameters from
the weak lensing measurements. For the neutrino mass, a clear signal for total
neutrino mass with 0.1 eV can be detected with 2-sigma significance. The
robustness and sensitivity of these results are checked in detail by allowing
the setup of cosmic shear experiment to vary as a function of observation time
or exposure time, showing that the improvement of the constraints very weakly
depends on the survey parameters, and the results mentioned above are nearly
optimal for the dark energy parameters and the neutrino mass.

Draconis, adopting collision of the winds, predicts soft X-ray bremsstrahlung
from nebulae downstream of the reverse shock with velocities > 150 km/s and
intensities comparable to those of the white dwarf black body flux. At
outbursts, the envelop of debris, which corresponds to the nebula downstream of
the high velocity shocks (700-1000 km/s) accompanying the blast wave, absorbs
the black body soft X-ray flux from the white dwarf, explains the broad
component of the H and He lines, and leads to low optical-UV-X-ray continuum
fluxes. The high optical-UV flux observed at the outbursts is explained by
bremsstrahlung downstream of the reverse shock between the stars. The depletion
of C, N, O, and Mg relative to H indicates that they are trapped into dust
grains and/or into diatomic molecules, suggesting that the collision of the
wind from the white dwarf with the dusty shells, ejected from the red giant
with about 1 year periodicity, leads to the U-band fluctuations during the
major bursts.

internal location-identification system for mobile devices based on integration
of RFID and wireless technology. The function of our system is based on
strategically located passive RFID tags placed on objects around building which
are identified using an RFID reader attached to a mobile device. The mobile
device reads the RFID tag and through the wireless network, sends the request
to the server. The server resolves the request and sends the desired
location-based information back to the mobile device. We had addressed that we
can go through the RFID technology for internal location identification
(indoor), which provides us better location accuracy because of no contact
between the tag and the reader, and the system requires no line of sight. In
this paper we had also focused on the issues of RFID technologies i.e.
Non-line-of-sight & High inventory speeds.

long-standing and well-known problem. Three methods proposed earlier to
calculate the tunneling probabilities and energy splitting: (1). Instanton
Method (2) WKb Approximation (3) Numerical Calculation.Instaton method is
helpful to understand the physical insight of quantum tunneling but the
validity is restricted to the case of large separation between the two
potential minima. WKB approximation is widely used in its simple mathematical
form, but the result is inaccurate due to its inherent defect in connection
formula. Recently WKB approximation has been developed by changing the phase
lose at the classical turning points but no above approximation have provide
the perfect result to the best of knowledge of Author. Using numerical methods,
one can get the solution up to the desired accuracy, but a considerable deal of
physical insight is lost in this process. In this paper, the Author presented
the developmentof models of multiple quantum wells or barriers potential by
using analytical Transfer matrix method (TMM), which has been applied to any
arbitrary potential wells and barriers successfully. The author applied the
above theory to three electronic device models and got satisfactory results.
