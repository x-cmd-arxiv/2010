generic boundary conditions the eigenvalues cannot be obtained from the
solution of finitely many algebraic Bethe equations. Based on careful finite
size studies of the analytic properties of the underlying hierarchy of transfer
matrices we devise two approaches to analyze the functional equations. First we
introduce a truncation method leading to Bethe type equations determining the
energy spectrum of the spin chain. In a second approach the hierarchy of
functional equations is mapped to an infinite system of non-linear integral
equations of TBA type. The two schemes have complementary ranges of
applicability and facilitate an efficient numerical analysis for a wide range
of boundary parameters. Some data are presented on the finite size corrections
to the energy of the state which evolves into the antiferromagnetic ground
state in the limit of parallel boundary fields.

collapsing into massive protogalactic halos at high redshift. The resulting
radiative cooling by HD can lower the gas temperature to that of the cosmic
microwave background, T_CMB=2.7(1+z)K, significantly below the temperature of a
few 100 K achievable via H_2-cooling alone, and thus reduce the masses of the
first generation of stars. Here we consider the suppression of HD-cooling by UV
irradiation in the Lyman-Werner (LW) bands. We include photo-dissociation of
both H_2 and HD, and explicitly compute the self-shielding and shielding of
both molecules by neutral hydrogen as well as the shielding of HD by H_2. We
use a simplified dynamical collapse model, and follow the chemical and thermal
evolution of the gas, in the presence of a UV background. We find that a LW
flux of J_crit = 1e-22 erg/cm^2/sr/s/Hz is able to suppress HD cooling and thus
prevent collapsing primordial gas from reaching temperatures below 100 K. The
main reason for the lack of HD cooling for J>J_crit is the partial
photo-dissociation of H_2, which prevents the gas from reaching sufficiently
low temperatures (T<150K) for HD to become the dominant coolant; direct HD
photo-dissociation is unimportant except for a narrow range of fluxes and
column densities. Since the prevention of HD-cooling requires only partial H_2
photo-dissociation, the critical flux J_crit is modest, and is below the UV
background required to reionize the universe at redshift z=10-20. We conclude
that HD-cooling can reduce the masses of typical stars only in rare halos
forming well before the epoch of reionization.

Ew were also measured. The globular clusters Ew were compared with model
predictions with ages within 4-15 Gyr, and metallicities between 1/200 and 2

integrated spectra among our sample appear qualitatively similar in most the
absorption features. The M05 models can properly predict the optical Ew
observed in globular clusters. Regarding the NIR, they do underestimate the
strength of Mg I 1.49mum, but they can reproduce the observed Ew of Fe I
1.58mum, Si I 1.59mum, and CO 2.29mum, in about half of our sample. The
remaining objects require the inclusion of intermediate-age populations. Thus,
we suggest that the presence of C- and O-rich stars in models is important to
reproduce the observed strengths of metallic lines. Another possibility is the
lack of alpha-enhancement in the models. In the case of the optical and NIR Fe
I lines, standard models and those that include blue horizontal branch stars,
produce similar results. A similar trend is observed for Na I 5895A, while in
the case of the G-band, the models with blue horizontal branch do describe
better the observations. For most of the sample the optical to NIR colours are
well described by the M05 models. In general, M05 models can provide reliable
information on the NIR stellar population of galaxies, but only when Ew and
colours are taken together, in other words, Ew and continuum fluxes should be
simultaneously fitted. However, the results should be taken with caution, since
the models tend to predict results biased towards young ages.

polarimetry to reach polarization sensitivities of 0.1%. As a spectrograph, the
instrument uses a LiNbO3 etalon in double pass and a narrow band pre-filter to
achieve a spectral resolution of 85 mAA. IMaX uses the high Zeeman sensitive
line of Fe I at 5250.2 AA and observes all four Stokes parameters at various
points inside the spectral line. This allows vector magnetograms, Dopplergrams,
and intensity frames to be produced that, after reconstruction, reach spatial
resolutions in the 0.15-0.18 arcsec range over a 50x50 arcsec FOV. Time
cadences vary between ten and 33 seconds, although the shortest one only
includes longitudinal polarimetry. The spectral line is sampled in various ways
depending on the applied observing mode, from just two points inside the line
to 11 of them. All observing modes include one extra wavelength point in the
nearby continuum. Gauss equivalent sensitivities are four Gauss for
longitudinal fields and 80 Gauss for transverse fields per wavelength sample.
The LOS velocities are estimated with statistical errors of the order of 5-40
m/s. The design, calibration and integration phases of the instrument, together

of g_0, we prove that the usual Dixmier map for nilpotent Lie algebras can be
naturally extended to the context of nilpotent super Lie algebras, i.e. there

sending the equivalence class [lambda] of a functional lambda to a primitive
ideal I(lambda) of U(g), and which coincides with the Dixmier map in the case
of nilpotent Lie algebras. Moreover, the construction of the previous map is
explicit, and more or less parallel to the one for Lie algebras, a major
difference with a previous approach. One key fact in the construction is the
existence of polarizations for super Lie algebras, generalizing the concept
defined for Lie algebras. As a corollary of the previous description, we obtain
that the quotient of the enveloping algebra by the ideal I(lambda) is
isomorphic to the tensor product Cliff_q(k) \otimes A_p(k) of a Clifford

millions of applications created by various individual programmers, some of
which may be malicious or flawed. In order to detect that an application is
malicious, monitoring its operation in a real environment for a significant
period of time is often required. Mobile devices have limited computation and
power resources and thus are limited in their monitoring capabilities. In this
paper we propose an efficient collaborative monitoring scheme that harnesses
the collective resources of many mobile devices, ""vaccinating"" them against
potentially unsafe applications. We suggest a new local information flooding
algorithm called ""TTL Probabilistic Propagation"" (TPP). The algorithm
periodically monitors one or more application and reports its conclusions to a
small number of other mobile devices, who then propagate this information
onwards. The algorithm is analyzed, and is shown to outperform existing state
of the art information propagation algorithms, in terms of convergence time as
well as network overhead. The maximal ""load"" of the algorithm (the fastest
arrival rate of new suspicious applications, that can still guarantee complete
monitoring), is analytically calculated and shown to be significantly superior
compared to any non-collaborative approach. Finally, we show both analytically
and experimentally using real world network data that implementing the proposed
algorithm significantly reduces the number of infected mobile devices. In
addition, we analytically prove that the algorithm is tolerant to several types
of Byzantine attacks where some adversarial agents may generate false
information, or abuse the algorithm in other ways.

entire photoionization budget at the redshifts considered here, with the exact
details dependent upon the assumed ionizing background and QSO contribution
thereto. It is possible that f_esc depends on the UV luminosity of the
galaxies, with fainter galaxies having higher f_esc, and estimates of f_esc
from a sample of faint LBG from the HUDF (i775<28.5) are in broad quantitative
agreement with such a scenario.

of nearby sources, which reduces the Poisson fluctuation in the flux. The WD
pulsars could dominate the quickly cooling electrons/positrons above TeV energy

provide a direct probe of the CR escape complementary to the CR nuclei and
gamma-rays. We calculate the electron spectra from a young pulsar embedded in
the supernova remnant (SNR), like Vela, taking into account the
energy-dependent CR escape. SNRs would accelerate and hence confine particles
with energy up to 10^{15.5}eV. Only energetic particles can escape first, while
the lower energy particles are confined and released later. Then the observed
electron spectrum should have a low energy cutoff whose position marks the age
of the pulsar/SNR. The low energy cutoff is observable in the $\gtrsim {\rm
TeV}$ energy window, where other contaminating sources are expected to be few
due to the fast cooling of electrons. The spectrum looks similar to a dark
matter annihilation line if the low energy cutoff is close to the high energy
intrinsic or cooling break. The future experiments such as CALET and CTA are
capable of directly detecting the CR escape features toward revealing the
origin of CRs.

As a preparatory step, we generalise the results for passive and active areas

arbitrary transverse momenta. As a main part of our study, we use the mass area
to analyse a range of modern jet algorithms acting on simple one and

their separation. We also study mass areas of jets from Monte Carlo simulations

bandpass filters centered at 8150A and 9140A with deep BVRIz broadband imaging
to select high-redshift galaxy candidates over an area of 4180 square arcmin.
The goal was to obtain a uniform selection of comparable depth over the 7
targeted fields in the two filters. For the GOODS-N region of the HDF-N field,
we also selected candidates using a 120A filter centered at 9210A. We made
spectroscopic observations with Keck DEIMOS of nearly all the candidates to
obtain the final sample of Ly alpha emitters. At the 3.3A resolution of the
DEIMOS observations the asymmetric profile for Ly alpha emission with its steep
blue fall-off can be clearly seen in the spectra of nearly all the galaxies. We
show that the spectral profiles are surprisingly similar for many of the
galaxies and that the composite spectral profiles are nearly identical at z=5.7
and z=6.5. We analyze the distributions of line widths and Ly alpha equivalent
widths and find that the lines are marginally narrower at the higher redshift,
with median values of 0.77A at z=6.5 and 0.92A at z=5.7. The line widths have a
dependence on the Ly alpha luminosity of the form L(L alpha)^(0.3). We compare
the surface densities and the luminosity functions at the two redshifts and
find that there is a multiplicative factor of 2 decrease in the number density
of bright Ly alpha emitters from z=5.7 to z=6.5, while the characteristic
luminosity is unchanged.

is based upon that of Greene, Peng & Ludwig, expanded with new near-IR

consistent continuum luminosity estimates at 5100A. We find that BH mass
estimates based on the FWHM of CIV show a systematic offset with respect to
those obtained from the line dispersion, sigma_l, of the same emission line,
but not with those obtained from the FWHM of Halpha and Hbeta. The magnitude of
the offset depends on the treatment of the HeII and FeII emission blended with
CIV, but there is little scatter for any fixed measurement prescription. While
we otherwise find no systematic offsets between CIV and Balmer line mass
estimates, we do find that the residuals between them are strongly correlated
with the ratio of the UV and optical continuum luminosities. Removing this
dependency reduces the scatter between the UV- and optical-based BH mass
estimates by a factor of approximately 2, from roughly 0.35 to 0.18 dex. The
dispersion is smallest when comparing the CIV sigma_l mass estimate, after
removing the offset from the FWHM estimates, and either Balmer line mass
estimate. The correlation with the continuum slope is likely due to a
combination of reddening, host contamination and object-dependent SED shapes.
When we add additional heterogeneous measurements from the literature, the
results are unchanged.

galaxies, aimed at measuring their stellar masses and population ages. The
goals of this study are to evaluate whether short GRBs track the stellar mass
distribution of galaxies, to investigate the progenitor delay time
distribution, and to explore any connection between long and short GRB
progenitors. Using single stellar population models we infer masses of
log(M/M_sun)=8.8-11.6 and population ages of tau=0.03-4.4 Gyr. We further infer
maximal masses of log(M/M_sun)=9.7-11.9 by assuming stellar population ages
equal to the age of the universe at each host's redshift. Comparing the
distribution of stellar masses to the general galaxy mass function we find that
short GRBs track the cosmic stellar mass distribution only if the late-type
hosts generally have maximal masses. However, there is an apparent dearth of
early-type hosts compared to the equal contribution of early- and late-type
galaxies to the cosmic stellar mass budget. These results suggest that stellar
mass may not be the sole parameter controlling the short GRB rate, and raise
the possibility of a two-component model with both mass and star formation
playing a role. If short GRBs in late-type galaxies indeed track the star
formation activity, the resulting typical delay time is ~0.2 Gyr, while those
in early-type hosts have a typical delay of ~3 Gyr. Using the same stellar
population models we fit the data for 22 long GRB hosts and find that they have
lower masses and younger population ages, with <log(M/M_sun)>=9.1 and
<tau>=0.06 Gyr, respectively; their maximal masses are similarly lower,
<log(M/M_sun)>=9.6. Most importantly, the two host populations remain distinct
even if we consider only the star-forming hosts of short GRBs, supporting our
previous findings that the progenitors of long GRBs and short GRBs in late-type
galaxies are distinct.

attention to the coupling physics, we determine their 21 cm absorption line
profiles. The infalling gas velocity around minihalos/dwarf galaxies strongly
affects the line shape, and with the low spin temperatures outside the virial
radii of the systems, gives rise to horn-like line profiles. The optical depth
of a dwarf galaxy is reduced for lines of sight penetrating through its HII
region, and especially, a large HII region created by a dwarf galaxy with
higher stellar mass and/or a top-heavy initial mass function results in an
optical depth trough rather than an absorption line. We compute synthetic
spectra of 21 cm forest for both high redshift quasars and radio afterglows of
gamma ray bursts (GRBs). Even with the planned SKA, radio afterglows of most if
not all GRBs would still be too dim to be the background sources for high
resolution (1 kHz) observations, but absorption lines can be easily detected
towards a high-z quasar. Broadband observation against GRB afterglows can also
be used to reveal the evolving 21 cm signal from both minihalos and dwarf
galaxies if there was no X-ray background or it was extremely weak, but it
becomes difficult if an early X-ray background existed. Hence the 21 cm
absorption could be a powerful probe of the presence/intensity of the X-ray

binding of the cloud with bound regions forming full IMFs whereas in the

temperatures we begin to see discrepancies between the two. This is due to the
fact that, unlike the polaron approach, the weak-coupling theory is incapable
of capturing multiphonon effects, while it also does not properly account for
phonon-induced renormalisation of the driving frequency. In particular, we find
that the weak-coupling theory often overestimates the damping rate when
compared to that predicted by the polaron theory. Finally, we extend our theory
to include non-Markovian effects and find that, for the parameters considered
here, they have little bearing on the excitonic Rabi rotations when plotted as
a function of pulse area.

characteristics consistent with flares observed by classical spectroscopic

increase from 0.02% for early M dwarfs to 3% for late M dwarfs. We find that
the flare duty cycle is larger in the population near the Galactic plane and
that the flare stars are more spatially restricted than the magnetically active

stellar age (younger stars are more likely to flare) and that the flare stars

From the remaining models we obtain predictions for the low-energy quadratic
slope parameters of $F_{\pi^0\gamma^*\gamma^*}$, currently out of experimental
reach but testable in the near future. We find it particularly useful to encode
this low-energy information in a form factor able to satisfy also QCD
short-distance constraints. We choose the form factor introduced by D'Ambrosio,
Isidori and Portoles in kaon decays, which has the right short distance for a
particular value of the quadratic slope, which is later shown to be compatible
with our holographic predictions. We then turn to a determination of the
(dominant) pion exchange diagram in the hadronic light by light scattering
contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment. We quantify the theoretical
uncertainty in $(g-2)_{\mu}$ coming from the different input we use: QCD short

test the pion-pole approximation. Our final result is
$a_{\mu}^{\pi^0}=6.54(25)\cdot 10^{-10}$, where the error is driven by the
linear slope of $F_{\pi^0\gamma^*\gamma^*}$, soon to be measured with precision
at KLOE-2. Our numerical analysis also indicates that large values of the

structure around the X-ray luminous cluster MACSJ0717.5 (z=0.545) to study the
morphology of galaxies at the cluster redshift. We find the global fraction of
morphological types of galaxies to be consistent with results in the
literature. Interestingly, we find that the fraction of S0s also correlates
with local galaxy density, in contrast to the findings of a study of the cores
of 10 clusters at similar redshift by Dressler et al. We suggest that this
apparent inconsistency is due to differences in the spatial coverage around
clusters, which is supported by the fact that the correlation disappears for
S0s within a radius of 0.6R_200 of MACSJ0717. We interpret this result as
evidence of the morphology-density relation being caused by a combination of
morphological transformation triggered by galaxy-galaxy interactions, and
effects related to the formation and evolution of large-scale structure. In
environments of low to intermediate density, where galaxy-galaxy interactions
are frequent and efficient, the observed pronounced morphology-density relation
for S0s reflects the density dependence of the interaction cross section. In
clusters, however, the correlation disappears for S0s, as the much higher
galaxy velocities in clusters not only lower the interaction cross section, but
also cause a spatial redistribution of galaxies that all but destroys such a
correlation. This argument does not hold for elliptical galaxies in clusters
which, having formed much earlier, have settled into the large-scale cluster
potential; hence the morphology-density relation for cluster ellipticals may
reflect primarily the state of advanced dynamical relaxation of this population
within the cluster rather than a causal link to the environment responsible for
the morphological transformation of galaxies.

interstellar extinction. The candidates were selected from the Massey et al.
(2006) catalog based on the following criteria: emission in Halpha, V<18.5 and
0.35<(B-V)<1.2. The spectra of both stars reveal a broad and strong Halpha
emission with extended wings (770 and 1000 km/s). Based on the spectra we
estimated the main parameters of the stars. Object N45901 has a bolometric
luminosity log(L/Lsun)=6.0-6.2 with the value of interstellar extinction
Av=2.3+-0.1. The temperature of the star's photosphere is estimated as
Tstar~13000-15000K its probable mass on the Zero Age Main Sequence is
M~60-80Msun. The infrared excess in N45901 corresponds to the emission of warm
dust with the temperature Twarm~1000K, and amounts to 0.1% of the bolometric
luminosity. A comparison of stellar magnitude estimates from different catalogs
points to the probable variability of the object N45901. Bolometric luminosity
of the second object, N125093, is log(L/Lsun)=6.3-6.6, the value of
interstellar extinction is Av=2.75+-0.15. We estimate its photosphere's
temperature as Tstar~13000-16000K, the initial mass as M~90-120Msun. The
infrared excess in N125093 amounts to 5-6% of the bolometric luminosity. Its
spectral energy distribution reveals two thermal components with the
temperatures Twarm~1000K and Tcold~480K. The [CaII] lines (7291A and 7323A),
observed in LBV-like stars VarA and N93351 in M33, are also present in the
spectrum of N125093. These lines indicate relatively recent gas eruptions and
dust activity linked with them. High bolometric luminosity of these stars and
broad Halpha emissions allow classifying the studied objects as LBV candidates.

around the star. Within this model and depending on the assumed visibility of
plasma parcels causing the oscillations, the observed shortest-period
oscillation period may indicate the stellar rotation period of 1.3 or 2.6 d,
synchronized with the disk at 4.5 or 7.1 solar radii, respectively.

importance of stellar collisions for the formation and mass accretion history
of high-mass stars. Our clusters start in virial equilibrium as a mix of gas
and proto-stars. Proto-stars then accrete matter using different mass accretion
rates and the amount of gas is reduced in the same way as the mass of stars
increases. During the simulations we check for stellar collisions and we
investigate the role of these collisions for the build-up of high-mass stars
and the formation of runaway stars. We find that a significant number of
collisions only occur in clusters with initial half-mass radii r_h < 0.1 pc.
After emerging from their parental gas clouds, such clusters end up too compact
compared to observed young, massive open clusters. In addition, collisions lead
mainly to the formation of a single runaway star instead of the formation of
many high mass stars with a broad mass spectrum. We therefore conclude that
massive stars form mainly by gas accretion, with stellar collisions only
playing a minor role if any at all. Collisions of stars in the pre-main
sequence phase might however contribute to the formation of the most massive
stars in the densest star clusters and possibly to the formation of
intermediate-mass black holes with masses up to a few 100 Msun.

size probability distribution undergoes a phase transition at a critical time

forecasting of rare events based on limited statistical sampling of the
collision dynamics over short time windows. The analysis was extended to
L$^p$-normed spaces ($p=1,...,\infty$) to allow for some amount of
interpenetration or volume exclusion. The results for the elastic collisions
are consistent with previously published low-dimensional results in that a
power law is observed for the empirical cluster size distribution at the

network, it is shown that forwarding an even/odd indicator bit for a scalar
quantization of a relay observation recovers 1 bit of information at the two
destinations in a noiseless interference channel where interference is treated
as noise. Based on this observation, a coding strategy is proposed to improve
the rate of both users at the same time using a relay node in an interference
channel. In this strategy, the relay observes a linear combination of the two
source signals, and broadcasts a common message to the two destinations over a
shared out-of-band link of rate R0 bits per channel use. The relay message
consists of the bin index of a structured binning scheme obtained from a
2^R0-way partition of the squared lattice in the complex plane. We show that
such scalar quantization-binning relay strategy asymptotically achieves the
cut-set bound in an interference channel with a common out-of-band relay link
of limited rate, improving the sum rate by two bits for every bit relayed,
asymptotically at high signal to noise ratios (SNR) and when interference is
treated as noise. We then use low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes along with
bit-interleaved coded-modulation (BICM) as a practical coding scheme for the
proposed strategy. We consider matched and mismatched scenarios, depending on
whether the input alphabet of the interference signal is known or unknown to
the decoder, respectively. For the matched scenario, we show the proposed
strategy results in significant gains in SNR. For the mismatched scenario, we
show that the proposed strategy results in rate improvements that, without the
relay, cannot be achieved by merely increasing transmit powers. Finally, we use
generalized mutual information analysis to characterize the theoretical
performance of the mismatched scenario and validate our simulation results.

(EOS) of mixed phase is different from the one obtained by a bulk application

at the reconnection site in-between this interacting loop system. This provides
the evidence of progressive reconnection and flare maximization at the
interaction site in the active region. The absence of type III radio burst
during this time period indicates no opening of magnetic field lines during the
flare energy release, which implies only the change of field lines
connectivity/orientation during the loop-loop interaction and reconnection
process. The Ondrejov dynamic radio spectrum shows an intense decimetric (DCIM)
radio burst (2.5--4.5 GHz, duration ~3 min) during flare initiation, which
reveals the signature of particle acceleration from the reconnection site
during loop-loop interaction. The double peak structures at 4.9 and 8.8 GHz
provide the most likely confirmatory signature of the loop-loop interaction at
the flare site in the active region. RHESSI hard X-ray images also show the
loop-top and footpoint sources of the corresponding two loop system and their
coalescence during the flare maximum, which act like the current carrying
flux-tubes with resultant opposite magnetic fields and the net force of

an exact flow-density diagram for two lane traffic. In addition, we introduce
two parameters that indicate respectively driver's driving-lane preference and
passing-lane priority. Due to the additional parameters, the model shows a
deviation of the density ratio for driving-lane use and a biased
lane-efficiency in flow. Then, a mean-field approach explicitly describes the
asymmetric flow by the hop rates, the driving-lane preference, and the
passing-lane priority. Meanwhile, the simulation results are in good agreement
with an observational data, and we thus estimate these parameters. We conclude
that the proposed model successfully produces two-lane traffic flow

$\theta_{c.m.}$$\approx$152${^\circ}$$\pm$8${^\circ}$, respectively. Several

have been determined by an $R$-matrix analysis of the differential cross

related to the reaction-rate calculation of the stellar

reaction from the hot CNO cycles into the $rp$-process in x-ray bursters. Here,
$J^\pi$=(3$^-$, 2$^-$) are tentatively assigned to the 6.15-MeV state which was
thought the key 1$^-$ state previously. In addition, a doublet structure at
7.05 MeV are tentatively identified, and its contribution to the resonant
reaction rate of $^{14}$O($\alpha$,$p$)$^{17}$F could be enhanced by at least
factors of about 4$\sim$6 in comparison with the previous estimation involving
only a singlet. The present calculated resonant rates are much larger than
those previous values, and it may imply that this breakout reaction could play
a crucial role under x-ray bursters conditions.

covariant derivative holds, in such Finsler spaces the metrical non-linear
angle-preserving connection is the respective export of the metrical linear
Riemannian connection. From the commutators of covariant derivatives the
associated curvature tensor is found. In case of the ${\cal FS}$-space, the
explicit example of the conformally automorphic transformation can be
developed, which entails the explicit connection coefficients and the metric

probabilities between states. Traditionally, data consist in sequences of
observed states for a given number of individuals over the whole observation
period. In such a case, the estimation of transition probabilities is
straightforwardly made by counting one-step moves from a given state to
another. In many real-life problems, however, the inference is much more
difficult as state sequences are not fully observed, namely the state of each
individual is known only for some given values of the time variable. A review
of the problem is given, focusing on Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) algorithms
to perform Bayesian inference and evaluate posterior distributions of the
transition probabilities in this missing-data framework. Leaning on the
dependence between the rows of the transition matrix, an adaptive MCMC
mechanism accelerating the classical Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is then
proposed and empirically studied.

nonrelativistic Sedov phase. Our goal is to determine the stability properties
of its frontal shock. We carried out a grid-adaptive relativistic 2D
hydro-simulation at extreme resolving power, following the GRB jet during the
entire afterglow phase. We investigate the effect of the finite initial jet
opening angle on the deceleration of the blast wave, and identify the growth of
various instabilities throughout the coasting shock front. We find that during
the relativistic phase, the blast wave is subject to pressure-ram pressure
instabilities that ripple and fragment the frontal shock. These instabilities
manifest themselves in the ultra-relativistic phase alone, remain in full
agreement with causality arguments, and decay slowly to finally disappear in
the near-Newtonian phase as the shell Lorentz factor drops below 3. From then
on, the compression rate decreases to levels predicted to be stable by a linear
analysis of the Sedov phase. Our simulations confirm previous findings that the
shell also spreads laterally because a rarefaction wave slowly propagates to
the jet axis, inducing a clear shell deformation from its initial spherical
shape. The blast front becomes meridionally stratified, with decreasing speed
from axis to jet edge.

magnetars, neutron stars whose emission results from the dissipation of their
magnetic field. The extremely high magnetic field of magnetars distorts their
shape, and causes the emission of a conspicuous gravitational waves signal if
rotation is fast and takes place around a different axis than the symmetry axis
of the magnetic distortion. Based on a numerical model of the cosmic star
formation history, we derive the cosmological background of gravitational waves
produced by magnetars, when they are very young and fast spinning. We adopt
different models for the configuration and strength of the internal magnetic
field (which determines the distortion) as well as different values of the
external dipole field strength (which governs the spin evolution of magnetars
over a wide range of parameters). We find that the expected gravitational wave
background differs considerably from one model to another. The strongest
signals are generated for magnetars with very intense toroidal internal fields
($\sim 10^{16}$ G range) and external dipole fields of $\sim 10^{14}$, as
envisaged in models aimed at explaining the properties of the Dec 2004 giant
flare from SGR 1806-20. Such signals should be easily detectable with third
generation ground based interferometers such as the Einstein Telescope.

microscopic world at the macroscopic level. Despite their apparent noisy
origin, fluctuations encode fundamental aspects of the physics of the system at
hand, crucial to understand irreversibility and nonequilibrium behavior. In
order to sustain a given fluctuation, a system traverses a precise optimal path
in phase space. Here we show that by demanding invariance of optimal paths
under symmetry transformations, new and general fluctuation relations valid
arbitrarily far from equilibrium are unveiled. This opens an unexplored route
toward a deeper understanding of nonequilibrium physics by bringing symmetry
principles to the realm of fluctuations. We illustrate this concept studying
symmetries of the current distribution out of equilibrium. In particular we
derive an isometric fluctuation relation which links in a strikingly simple
manner the probabilities of any pair of isometric current fluctuations. This
relation, which results from the time-reversibility of the dynamics, includes
as a particular instance the Gallavotti-Cohen fluctuation theorem in this
context but adds a completely new perspective on the high level of symmetry
imposed by time-reversibility on the statistics of nonequilibrium fluctuations.
The new symmetry implies remarkable hierarchies of equations for the current
cumulants and the nonlinear response coefficients, going far beyond Onsager's
reciprocity relations and Green-Kubo formulae. We confirm the validity of the
new symmetry relation in extensive numerical simulations, and suggest that the
idea of symmetry in fluctuations as invariance of optimal paths has
far-reaching consequences in diverse fields.

altimetric data and corneal power maps from the data collected by keratoscopes,
such as the Placido rings based topographers, decisive for an early detection
of corneal diseases such as keratoconus.
  Numerical experiments show that the algorithm exhibits a steady exponential
error decay, independently of the level of aberration of the cornea. The
complexity of each anisotropic gaussian basis functions in the functional
representation is the same, but their parameters vary to fit the current scale.
This scale is determined only by the residual errors and not by the number of
the iteration. Finally, the position and clustering of their centers, as well
as the size of the shape parameters, provides an additional spatial information
about the regions of higher irregularity. These results are compared with the
standard approximation procedures based on the Zernike polynomials expansions.

between 2 and 60 mas in radius, our observations exclude at 3 sigma
significance the presence of companions with K-band contrasts greater than 5e-3

The median 1-sigma error bar in the contrast of potential companions within our

found for a faint companion located at about 14.4 mas from beta Pic, which has
a contrast of 1.8e-3 \pm 1.1e-3 (a result consistent with the absence of
companions). For angular separations larger than 60 mas, both time smearing and
field-of-view limitations reduce the sensitivity. Conclusions. We can exclude
the presence of brown dwarfs with masses higher than 29 Mjup (resp. 47 Mjup) at

may still show activity in low-mass environments or when being rejuvenated by
wet mergers. In late-type galaxies, we find continuous, though variable star
formation over a Hubble time. In the dwarf regime, a wide range of properties

discovery at RHIC. We analyze the correlation between different observables
like the nuclear modification factor $\Rapt$, the elliptic flow and the ratio
of quark to gluon suppressions. We show that the temperature (or entropy
density) dependence of the in-medium energy loss strongly affects the relation
among these observables. In particular the large elliptic flow and the nearly
equal $\Rapt$ of quarks and gluons can be accounted for only if the energy loss
occurs mainly around $T_c$ and the $q\leftrightarrow g$ conversion is
significant. The use of an equation of state fitted to lattice QCD
calculations, slowing down the cooling as $T \to T_c$, seems to contribute to
both the enhancement of $v_2$ and the efficiency of the conversion mechanism.

the underlying white dwarf star in V709 Cas, as has been previously claimed;
based on the non-detection of the secondary star, we argue that the system is
farther away that had been thought and the white dwarf contribution is probably
negligible. V478 Her had been classified as an SU UMa-type dwarf nova, but this
is incompatible with the long orbital period we find. We report the first
secondary-star velocity curve for V1062 Tau. In V542 Cyg, we find a late-type

unresolved in a direct image, suggesting that it is a hierarchical triple

870 micron dust continuum data. The gas kinetic temperature in the cores is
between ~9.4-13.9 K. The non-thermal velocity dispersion is subsonic in most of
the cores. The non-thermal linewidth in protostellar cores appears to increase
with increasing bolometric luminosity. The core masses are very likely drawn
from the same parent distribution as the core masses in Orion B North. Starless
cores in the region are likely to be gravitationally bound, and thus
prestellar. Some of the cores have a lower radial velocity than the systemic
velocity of the region, suggesting that they are members of the ""low-velocity
part"" of Orion B. The observed core-separation distances deviate from the
corresponding random-like model distributions. The distances between the
nearest-neighbours are comparable to the thermal Jeans length. The fractional
abundances of NH3 and N2H+ in the cores are ~1.5-9.8x10^{-8} and
~0.2-5.9x10^{-10}, respectively. The NH3 abundance appears to decrease with
increasing H2 column and number densities. The NH3/N2H+ column density ratio is
larger in starless cores than in cores with embedded protostars. The core
population in Orion B9 is comparable in physical properties to those in nearby
low-mass star-forming regions. It is unclear if the origin of cores could be
explained by turbulent fragmentation. On the other hand, many of the core
properties conform with the picture of dynamic core evolution. The Orion B9
region has probably been influenced by the feedback from the nearby Ori OB 1b
group, and the fragmentation of the parental cloud into cores could be caused
by gravitational instability.

interacting with a large external system with N states. The coupling is
described by a random hamiltonian in a new general gaussian SU(2)xU(N) random
matrix ensemble, that we introduce in this paper. We solve the model in the
large N limit, for any value of the spin j and for any choice of the coupling
matrix element distributions in the different possible angular momentum
channels l (and provided that the internal dynamics of the spin is slow).
Besides its mathematical interest as a non-trivial random matrix model, it
allows to study and illustrate in a simple framework various phenomena: the
decoherence dynamics, the conditions of emergence of the classical phase space
for the spin, the properties quantum diffusion in phase space. The large time
evolution for the spin is shown to be non-Markovian in general, the Markov
property emerging in some specific case for the dynamics and the initial
conditions.

learning rule based on spike-time-dependent plasticity, with an asymmetric time
window depending on the relative timing between pre- and post-synaptic
activity. We store multiple patterns and study the network capacity.
  For the analog model, we find that the network capacity scales linearly with
the network size, and that both capacity and the oscillation frequency of the
retrieval state depend on the asymmetry of the learning time window. In
addition to fully-connected networks, we study sparse networks, where each
neuron is connected only to a small number z << N of other neurons. Connections
can be short range, between neighboring neurons placed on a regular lattice, or
long range, between randomly chosen pairs of neurons. We find that a small
fraction of long range connections is able to amplify the capacity of the
network. This imply that a small-world-network topology is optimal, as a
compromise between the cost of long range connections and the capacity
increase.
  Also in the spiking integrate and fire model the crucial result of storing

be marginally accommodated within the forward shock emission under the

of the WMAP7+SN+BAO dataset in the context of the non-minimally coupled Higgs

m_T=171.3 GeV, the fit of the inflation model with non-minimally coupled Higgs

We show that the inflation driven by a non-minimally coupled scalar field to
the Einstein gravity leads to significant constraints on the scalar spectral
index and tensor-to-scalar ratio when compared with the similar constraints
tensor to from the standard inflation with minimally coupled scalar field. We
also show that an accurate reconstruction of the Higgs potential in terms of
inflationary observables requires an improved accuracy of other parameters of
the Standard Model of particle physics as the top quark mass and the effective

nonlinear interaction of quantum Langmuir waves (QLWs) and quantum ion-acoustic
waves (QIAWs), which are governed by the one-dimensional quantum Zakharov
equations (QZEs). It is shown that a transition to spatiotemporal chaos (STC)
occurs when the length scale of excitation of linear modes is larger than that
of the most unstable ones. Such length scale is, however, to be larger
(compared to the classical one) in presence of the quantum tunneling effect.
The latter induces strong QIAW emission leading to the occurrence of collision
and fusion among the patterns at an earlier time than the classical case.
Moreover, numerical simulation of the QZEs reveals that many solitary patterns
can be excited and saturated through the modulational instability (MI) of
unstable harmonic modes. In a longer time, these solitons are seen to appear in
the state of STC due to strong QIAW emission as well as by the collision and
fusion in stochastic motion. The energy in the system is thus strongly
redistributed, which may switch on the onset of Langmuir turbulence in quantum
plasmas.

shared with the reception path of the CR, so that the lowrate streaming samples

functionality they provide. Combining these advantages leads to a real time map
of the spectrum with minimal use of mobile resources. Our approach is based on
the modulated wideband converter (MWC) system, which samples sparse wideband

half lines with the same origin. Our analysis is based on a reduction of the
walk on a half line. The idea plays an important role to analyze the walks on
some class of graphs with \textit{symmetric} initial states. In this paper, we
introduce a quantum walk with an enlarged basis and show that $W_{t,\kappa}$
can be reduced to the walk on a half line even if the initial state is
\textit{asymmetric}. For $W_{t,\kappa}$, we obtain two types of limit theorems.
The first one is an asymptotic behavior of $W_{t,\kappa}$ which corresponds to
localization. For some conditions, we find that the asymptotic behavior
oscillates. The second one is the weak convergence theorem for $W_{t,\kappa}$.
On each half line, $W_{t,\kappa}$ converges to a density function like the case
of the one-dimensional lattice with a scaling order of $t$. The results contain
the cases of quantum walks starting from the general initial state on a half

QECCs can be very much different from decoding classical codes due to the
degeneracy property. Intuitively, one expect degeneracy would simplify the
decoding since two different errors might not and need not be distinguished in

Lorentz-symmetry violating Electrodynamics in an $N=1$-supersymmetric
framework. A chiral and a vector superfield are chosen to describe the
background that signals Lorentz-symmetry breaking. In each case, the $\ K_{\mu
\nu \kappa \lambda }$-tensor is expressed in terms of the components of the
background superfield that we choose to describe the breaking. We also present
in detail the actions with all fermionic partners of the background that
determine $\ K_{\mu \nu \kappa \lambda }$.

wide luminescence band peaking at ~2.1 eV with a long luminescence time at 8 K

excitation spectra of ZnO:Ga have been measured in the range from 4 to 12.5 eV

by stretches of linker DNA) fold into higher-order chromatin structures which
ultimately make up eukaryotic chromosomes. Chromatin structure formation leads
to 10-11 base pair (bp) discretization of linker lengths caused by the smaller
free energy cost of packaging nucleosomes into a regular chromatin fiber if
their rotational setting (defined by DNA helical twist) is conserved. We
describe nucleosome positions along the fiber using a thermodynamic model of
finite-size particles with effective two-body interactions, subject to an
arbitrary external potential. We infer both one-body and two-body energies from
readily available large-scale maps of nucleosome positions. We show that
two-body forces play a leading role in establishing well-known 10-11 bp
genome-wide periodicity of nucleosome occupancies. They also explain nucleosome
ordering over transcribed regions observed in both in vitro and in vivo
high-throughput experiments.
