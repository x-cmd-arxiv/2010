To this end we calculate the electronic Raman response on the basis of results
from angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). In the limits of our
approximations we find agreement on the overdoped side and pronounced
discrepancies at lower doping. In contrast to the successful approach for the
transport properties at low energies, the Raman and the ARPES data cannot be
reconciled by adding angle-dependent momentum scattering. We discuss possible
routes towards an explanation of the suppression of spectral weight close to
the $(\pi,0)$ points which sets in abruptly close to 21% doping.

microstructural level of ferroelectric (FE) materials is applied to maximize
piezoelectricity. Piezoelectricity in ceramic FEs differ significantly from
that of single crystals because of the presence of crystallites (grains)
possessing crystallographic axes aligned imperfectly. The piezoelectric
properties of a polycrystalline (ceramic) FE is inextricably related to the
grain orientation distribution (texture). The set of combination of variables,
known as solution space, which dictates the texture of a ceramic is unlimited
and hence the choice of the optimal solution which maximizes the
piezoelectricity is complicated. Thus a stochastic global optimization combined
with homogenization is employed for the identification of the optimal granular
configuration of the FE ceramic microstructure with optimum piezoelectric
properties. The macroscopic equilibrium piezoelectric properties of
polycrystalline FE is calculated using mathematical homogenization at each
iteration step. The configuration of grains characterised by its orientations
at each iteration is generated using a randomly selected set of orientation
distribution parameters. Apparent enhancement of piezoelectric coefficient
$d_{33}$ is observed in an optimally oriented BaTiO$_3$ single crystal. A
configuration of crystallites, simultaneously constraining the orientation
distribution of the c-axis (polar axis) while incorporating ab-plane
randomness, which would multiply the overall piezoelectricity in ceramic
BaTiO$_{3}$ is also identified. The orientation distribution of the c-axes is
found to be a narrow Gaussian distribution centred around ${45^\circ}$. The
piezoelectric coefficient in such a ceramic is found to be nearly three times
as that of the single crystal.

importance for actual reaction simulations. First, the preparation of the
initial state within the same methodology as for the reaction dynamics is
demonstrated by an adiabatic switching on of the mean-field interaction, which
leads to the mean-field ground state. Second, the importance of the Green's
function matrix-elements far away from the spatial diagonal is analyzed by a
suitable suppression process that does not significantly affect the evolution
of the elements close to the diagonal. The relative lack of importance of the
far-away elements is tied to system expansion. We also examine the evolution of
the Wigner function and verify quantitatively that erasing of the off-diagonal
elements corresponds to averaging out of the momentum-space details in the
Wigner function.

boolean-width $O(\log n)$ and problems solvable in $O^*(2^{O(k)})$, combining
these two results to design polynomial algorithms. We show that for trapezoid
graphs, circular permutation graphs, convex graphs, Dilworth-$k$ graphs,
circular arc graphs and complements of $k$-degenerate graphs,
boolean-decompositions of width $O(\log n)$ can be found in polynomial time. We
also show that circular $k$-trapezoid graphs have boolean-width $O(\log n)$,

of energy in a highly collimated, extremely relativistic jet. This in turn
appears to require a rapidly spinning highly magnetised stellar core that
collapses into a magnetic neutron star or a black hole within a relatively
massive envelope. They appear to be associated with type Ib/c supernovae but,
with a birthrate of around 10^{-6}-10^{-5} per year per galaxy, they are
considerably rarer than such supernovae in general. To satisfy all these
requirements we hypothesize a binary star model that ends with the merging of
an oxygen neon white dwarf with the carbon-oxygen core of a naked helium star
during a common envelope phase of evolution. The rapid spin and high magnetic
field are natural consequences of such a merging. The evolution that leads to
these progenitors is convoluted and so naturally occurs only very rarely. To
test the hypothesis we evolve a population of progenitors and find that the
rate is as required. At low metallicity we calculate that a similar fraction of
stars evolve to this point and so would expect the gamma-ray burst rate to
correlate with the star formation rate in any galaxy. This too is consistent
with observations. These progenitors, being of intermediate mass, differ
radically from the usually postulated high-mass stars. Thus we can reconcile
observations that the bursts occur close to but not within massive star
associations.

absorption line systems, we detect luminous L>L* galaxies for four of the five
fields within 10"" of the QSO. In contrast to previous imaging surveys of DLA
systems at these redshifts, which indicate a range of morphological types and
luminosities for the host galaxies of the systems, the galaxies we detect in
these sub-DLA fields appear to be luminous (L>L*). In the case of the absorber
towards Q1009-0026 at z=0.8866 we have spectroscopic confirmation that the
candidate galaxy is at the redshift of the absorber, at an impact parameter of
~35 kpc with a luminosity of 3 < L/L* < 8 depending on the magnitude of the
K-correction. These observations are in concordance with the view that sub-DLAs
may be more representative of massive galaxies than DLA systems. The
environments of the absorbers span a range of types, from the inner disk of a
galaxy, the periphery of a luminous galaxy, and the outskirts of interacting
galaxies. The large impact parameters to some of the candidate galaxies suggest
that galactic outflows or tidal tails are likely responsible for the material
seen in absorption. We find a weak correlation between N(HI) and the impact
parameter at the 2 sigma level, which may be expected from the heterogeneous
population of galaxies hosting the absorption line systems and random
orientation angles. In addition, we detect a possible gravitationally lensed

closed trapped surfaces have a non-local property, ""clairvoyance"", which is
inherited by $\B$. We prove that $\B$ is not a marginally trapped tube in
general, and that it can have portions in regions whose whole past is flat. For
asymptotically flat black holes, we identify a general past barrier, well
inside the event horizon, to the location of $\B$ under physically reasonable
conditions. We also define the core $\mathscr{Z}$ of the trapped region as that
part of $\mathscr{T}$ which is indispensable to sustain closed trapped
surfaces. We prove that the unique spherically symmetric dynamical horizon is
the boundary of such a core, and we argue that this may serve to single it out.
To illustrate the results, some explicit examples are discussed, namely
Robertson-Walker geometries and the imploding Vaidya spacetime.

those derived from the synthesis. We find that CRD calculations derived using
the most recent quiet Sun model, on average, reproduce the measured values of
the quiet Sun regions slightly more accurately than PRD computations with the
same model. This may reflect that the utilized atmospheric model was computed
assuming CRD. Calculations with PRD on earlier quiet Sun model atmospheres
reproduce measured quantities with a similar accuracy as to that achieved here
by applying CRD to the recent model. We also find that the median contrast
values measured for most of the identified bright features, disk positions, and
filter widths are, on average, a factor 1.9 lower than those derived from PRD
simulations performed using the recent bright feature models. The discrepancy
between measured and modeled values decreases by 12% after taking into account

version of the MSSM (CMSSM) and its differences with models based on minimal
supergravity (mSUGRA), I will consider the effects of unifying the
supersymmetry-breaking parameters at a scale above M_{GUT}. One of the
consequences of superGUT unification, is the ability to take vanishing scalar
masses at the unification scale with a neutralino LSP dark matter candidate.
This allows one to resurrect no-scale supergravity as a viable phenomenological
model.

be overcome before these devices can be combined into network-level
architectures. In particular, due to the high refractive index contrast between
the core and cladding of semiconductor waveguides, nanoscale defects along the
waveguide often scatter light into the backward-propagating mode. These
reflections could result in unwanted feedback to optical sources or crosstalk
in bidirectional interconnects such as those employed in fiber-optic networks.
It is often assumed that these reflected waves spatially overlap the
forward-propagating waves making it difficult to implement optical circulators

direction. Here, we individually identify and map the near-field mode profiles
of forward-propagating and reflected light in a single-mode silicon waveguide
using Transmission-based near-field scanning optical microscopy (TraNSOM). We
show that unlike fiber-optic waveguides, the high-index-contrast and nanoscale
dimensions of semiconductor waveguides create counter propagating waves with
distinct spatial near-field profiles. These near-field differences are a
previously-unobserved consequence of nanoscale light confinement and could
provide a basis for novel elements to filter forward-propagating from reflected

starts with the identification of sources, continues with the extraction and
transformation of data from these sources, and then loads the data into a set
of data marts according to desired multidimensional relational schemas. End
user business intelligence tools are added on top of the materialized
multidimensional schemas to drive decision making in an organization.
Unfortunately, this bottom-up approach is costly both in terms of the skilled
users needed and the sheer size of the warehouses. This paper proposes a
top-down framework in which data warehousing is driven by a conceptual model.
The framework offers both design time and run time environments. At design
time, a business user first uses the conceptual modeling language as a
multidimensional object model to specify what business information is needed;
then she maps the conceptual model to a pre-existing logical multidimensional
representation. At run time, a system will transform the user conceptual model
together with the mappings into views over the logical multidimensional
representation. We focus on how the user can conceptually abstract from an
existing data warehouse, and on how this conceptual model can be mapped to the
logical multidimensional representation. We also give an indication of what
query language is used over the conceptual model. Finally, we argue that our
framework is a step along the way to allowing automatic generation of the data
warehouse.

coupling, raised lately in the newly-proposed Horava-Lifshitz (HL) theory of
quantum gravity with projectability condition. We find that all the scalar
modes are stable in the de Sitter background, due to two different kinds of
effects, one from high-order derivatives of the spacetime curvature, and the
other from the exponential expansion of the de Sitter space. Combining these
effects properly, one can make the instability found in the Minkowski
background never appear even for small-scale modes, provided that the IR limit
is sufficiently closed to the relativistic fixed point. At the fixed point, all
the modes become stabilized. We also show that the instability of Minkowski
spacetime can be cured by introducing mass to the spin-0 graviton. The strong
coupling problem is investigated following the effective field theory approach,
and found that it cannot be cured by the Blas-Pujolas-Sibiryakov mechanism,
initially designed for the case without projectability condition, but might be
circumvented by the Vainshtein mechanism, due to the non-linear effects. In
fact, we construct a class of exact solutions, and show explicitly that it
reduces smoothly to the de Sitter spacetime in the relativistic limit.

at z=3.5 is red and faint in the observer's optical, with median r=26.1, and
rest-frame U-V=1.6. About 60% of the sample have optical colors satisfying
either the U- or the B-dropout color criteria, although ~50% of these galaxies

zero. However, >80% of the sample is detected at 24 micron, with total infrared
luminosities in the range (0.5-4.0)x10^13 Lsun. This implies the presence of
either dust-enshrouded starburst activity (with SFRs of 600-4300 Msun/yr)
and/or highly-obscured active galactic nuclei (AGN). The contribution of
galaxies with M_star>2.5x10^11 Msun to the total stellar mass budget at z=3.5

errors up to a factor of ~8 in the densities, bringing the observed SMF in
marginal agreement with the predicted SMF. Additional systematic uncertainties
on the high-mass end could be introduced by either 1) the intense

our position to be very close to the void centre. By selecting from a family of
void profiles that fit supernova luminosity data, we carefully determine how
far from the centre we could be. To do so, we use the observed dipole component
of the cosmic microwave background, as well as an additional stochastic
peculiar velocity arising from primordial perturbations. We find that we are
constrained to live within 80 Mpc of the centre of a void--a somewhat weaker
constraint than found in previous studies, but nevertheless a strong violation
of the Copernican principle. By considering how such a Gpc-scale void would
appear on the microwave sky, we also show that there can be a maximum of one of
these voids within our Hubble radius. Hence, the constraint on our position
corresponds to a fraction of the Hubble volume of order 10^{-8}. Finally, we
use the fact that void models only look temporarily similar to a
cosmological-constant-dominated universe to argue that these models are not
free of temporal fine-tuning.

near-antinodal regions behave differently as a function of temperature and
doping, implying that different orders dominate in different momentum-space
regions. However, the ubiquity of sharp quasiparticles all around the Fermi
surface in Bi-2212 indicates that superconductivity extends into the
momentum-space region dominated by the pseudogap, revealing subtlety in this
dichotomy. In Bi-2201, the temperature dependence of antinodal spectra reveals
particle-hole asymmetry and anomalous spectral broadening, which may constrain
the explanation for the pseudogap. Recognizing that electron-boson coupling is
an important aspect of cuprate physics, we close with a discussion of the
multiple 'kinks' in the nodal dispersion. Understanding these may be important

separate fields, a total of 160 individual galaxies has been detected in
neutral hydrogen, with HI masses varying from 1.1x10^9 to 4.0x10^10 Msun. The
largest galaxies are spatially resolved by the synthesized beam of 23x37
arcsec^2 while the velocity resolution of 19 km/s allowed the HI emission lines
to be well resolved. The large scale structure in the surveyed volume is traced
well in HI, apart from the highest density regions like the cores of galaxy
clusters. All significant HI detections have obvious or plausible optical
counterparts which are usually blue late-type galaxies that are UV-bright. One
of the observed fields contains a massive Butcher-Oemler cluster but none of
the associated blue galaxies has been detected in HI. The data suggest that the
lower-luminosity galaxies at z=0.2 are more gas-rich than galaxies of similar
luminosities at z=0, pending a careful analysis of the completeness near the
detection limit. Optical counterparts of the HI detected galaxies are mostly
located in the 'blue cloud' of the galaxy population although several galaxies
on the 'red sequence' are also detected in HI. These results hold great promise
for future deep 21cm surveys of neutral hydrogen with MeerKAT, APERTIF, ASKAP,
and ultimately the Square Kilometre Array.

synchrotron emission in the northeastern limb of SN 1006, using two Chandra

(about 10"") regions. After taking account of proper motion and isolating the
synchrotron from the thermal emission, we study time variations in the
synchrotron emission in the small regions. We find that there are no regions
showing strong flux variations. Our analysis shows an apparent flux decline in
the overall synchrotron flux of about 4% at high energies, but we suspect that
this is mostly a calibration effect, and that flux is actually constant to
about 1%. This is much less than the variation found in other remnants where it
was used to infer magnetic-field strengths up to 1 mG. We attribute the lack of
variability to the smoothness of the synchrotron morphology, in contrast to the
small-scale knots found to be variable in other remnants. The smoothness is to
be expected for a Type Ia remnant encountering uniform material. Finally we
find a spatial correlation between the flux and the cut-off frequency in
synchrotron emission. The simplest interpretation is that the cut-off frequency
depends on the magnetic-field strength. This would require that the maximum
energy of accelerated electrons is not limited by synchrotron losses, but by
some other effect. Alternatively, the rate of particle injection and
acceleration may vary due to some effect not yet accounted for, such as a
dependence on shock obliquity.

Glivenko-Cantelli function class (i.e., a function class that admits a Uniform
Law of Large Numbers) and demonstrate its power by giving simple derivations of
the fundamental limits on the achievable rates in several source coding
scenarios, in which the relevant operational criteria pertain to reproducing

of n-body techniques that incorporates the accretional growth of stars from the
gaseous reservoir in which they are embedded. Following on from Monte Carlo
studies by Davis et al., we target our experiments toward populous clusters
likely to experience collisions as a result of accretion-driven contraction. We
verify that in less extreme star forming environments, similar to Orion, the
stellar density is low enough that collisions are unimportant, but that
conditions suitable for stellar collisions are much more easily satisfied in
large-n clusters, i.e. n ~ 30,000 (we argue, however, that the density of the
Arches cluster is insufficient for us to expect stellar collisions to have
occurred in the cluster's prior evolution). We find that the character of the
collision process is not such that it is a route toward smoothly filling the
top end of the mass spectrum. Instead, runaway growth of one or two extreme
objects can occur within less than 1 Myr after accretion is shut off, resulting
in a few objects with masses several times the maximum reached by accretion.
The rapid formation of these objects is due to not just the post-formation
dynamical evolution of the clusters, but an interplay of dynamics and the
accretional growth of the stars. We find that accretion-driven cluster
shrinkage results in a distribution of gas and stars that offsets the
disruptive effect of gas expulsion, and we propose that the process can lead to
massive binaries and early mass segregation in star clusters.

have provided accurate estimates for the mass of the central supermassive black
hole and the size and structure of the accretion disk in nearby galaxies. To
find water masers at much higher redshifts, we have begun a survey of known
gravitationally lensed quasars and star-forming galaxies. In this paper, we
present a search for 22 GHz (rest frame) water masers toward five dusty,
gravitationally lensed quasars and star-forming galaxies at redshifts 2.3--2.9
with the Effelsberg telescope and the EVLA. Our observations do not find any
new definite examples of high redshift water maser galaxies, suggesting that
large reservoirs of dust and gas are not a sufficient condition for powerful
water maser emission. However, we do find the tentative detection of a water
maser system in the active galaxy IRAS 10214+4724 at redshift 2.285. Our survey
has now doubled the number of lensed galaxies and quasars that have been
searched for high redshift water masers. We present an analysis of the high
redshift water maser luminosity function that is based on the results presented
here and from the only cosmologically distant (z > 1) water maser galaxy found
thus far, MG J0414+0534 at redshift 2.64. By comparing with the luminosity
function locally and at moderate redshifts, we find that there must be some
evolution in the luminosity function of water maser galaxies at high redshifts.
By assuming a moderate evolution [(1 + z )^4] in the luminosity function, we
find that blind surveys for water maser galaxies are only worthwhile with
extremely high sensitivity like that of the planned Square Kilometre Array.
However, instruments like the EVLA and MeerKAT will be capable of detecting
water maser systems similar to the one found from MG J0414+0534 through
targeted observations.

This relationship is subsequently employed to determine the lower bound to the

tropical overturning circulations (Walker circulations) are examined over a
wide range of climates simulated with an idealized atmospheric general
circulation model (GCM). The asymmetry in the tropical climate is generated by
an imposed ocean energy flux, which does not vary with climate. The range of
climates is simulated by modifying the optical thickness of an idealized
longwave absorber (representing greenhouse gases).
  The zonal surface temperature gradient in low latitudes generally decreases
as the climate warms in the idealized GCM simulations. A scaling relationship
based on a two-term balance in the surface energy budget accounts for the
changes in the zonally asymmetric component of the GCM-simulated surface
temperature gradients.
  The Walker circulation weakens as the climate warms in the idealized
simulations, as it does in comprehensive simulations of climate change. The
wide range of climates allows a systematic test of energetic arguments that
have been proposed to account for these changes in the tropical circulation.
The analysis shows that a scaling estimate based on changes in the hydrological
cycle (precipitation rate and saturation specific humidity) accounts for the
simulated changes in the Walker circulation. However, it must be evaluated
locally, with local precipitation rates. If global-mean quantities are used,
the scaling estimate does not generally account for changes in the Walker
circulation, and the extent to which it does is the result of compensating
errors in changes in precipitation and saturation specific humidity that enter
the scaling estimate.

based on the traditional linear utility functions. Recall that an Arrow-Debreu
market equilibrium in a conventional exchange market with linear utility
functions can be computed in polynomial time by convex programming. Our
complexity results show that even a bounded-degree, planar influence network
can significantly increase the difficulty of equilibrium computation even in
markets with only a constant number of goods. Our algorithmic results suggest
that finding an approximate equilibrium in markets with hierarchical influence
networks might be easier than that in markets with arbitrary neighborhood
structures. By demonstrating a simple market with a constant number of goods
and a bounded-degree, planar influence graph whose equilibrium is PPAD-hard to
approximate, we also provide a counterexample to a common belief, which we
refer to as the myth of a constant number of goods, that equilibria in markets

approximately $2^{\circ} \times 2^{\circ}$ around the Sculptor group galaxy
NGC~300 in the 21-cm line emission of neutral hydrogen. We achieved a $5
\sigma$ \ion{H}{i} column density sensitivity of $10^{19}~\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$
over a spectral channel width of $8~\mathrm{km \, s}^{-1}$ for emission filling
the $180'' \times 88''$ synthesised beam. The corresponding \ion{H}{i} mass
sensitivity is $1.2 \times 10^{5}~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, assuming a distance of
$1.9~\mathrm{Mpc}$. For the first time, the vast \ion{H}{i} disc of NGC~300 has
been mapped over its entire extent at a moderately high spatial resolution of
about $1~\mathrm{kpc}$.
  NGC~300 is characterised by a dense inner \ion{H}{i} disc, well aligned with
the optical disc of $290^{\circ}$ orientation angle, and an extended outer
\ion{H}{i} disc with a major axis of more than $1^{\circ}$ on the sky
(equivalent to a diameter of about $35~\mathrm{kpc}$) and a different
orientation angle of $332^{\circ}$. A significant fraction (about 43~per cent)
of the total detected \ion{H}{i} mass of $1.5 \times 10^{9}~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$
resides within the extended outer disc. We fitted a tilted ring model to the
velocity field of NGC~300 to derive the rotation curve out to a radius of
$18.4~\mathrm{kpc}$, almost twice the range of previous rotation curve studies.
The rotation curve rises to a maximum velocity of almost $100~\mathrm{km \,
s}^{-1}$ and then gently decreases again in the outer disc beyond a radius of
about $10~\mathrm{kpc}$. Mass models fitted to the derived rotation curve yield
good fits for Burkert and NFW dark matter halo models, whereas
pseudo-isothermal halo models and MOND-based models both struggle to cope with
the declining rotation curve.
  We also observe significant asymmetries in the outer \ion{H}{i} disc of
NGC~300, in particular near the edge of the disc, which are possibly due to ram
pressure stripping of gas by the intergalactic medium (IGM) of the Sculptor
group. Our estimates show that ram pressure stripping can occur under
reasonable assumptions on the density of the IGM and the relative velocity of
NGC~300. The asymmetries in the gas disc suggest a proper motion of NGC~300
toward the south-east. At the same time, our data exclude IGM densities of
significantly higher than $10^{-5}~\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ in the vicinity of
NGC~300, as otherwise the outer gas disc would have been stripped.

for magnetic fields below 100GT the variation of the radius at ISCO is
negligible and hence the non-magnetized approximate expression can be used. In

preferentially attracts one of the components, interfaces between A-rich and

Young's equation describes this angle in terms of a balance between the $A-B$
interfacial tension $\gamma_{AB}$ and the surface tensions $\gamma_{wA}$,
$\gamma_{wB}$ between, respectively, the $A$- and $B$-rich phases and the wall,
$\gamma _{AB} \cos \theta =\gamma_{wA}-\gamma_{wB}$. By Monte Carlo simulations
of bridges, formed by one of the components in a binary Lennard-Jones liquid,
connecting the two walls of a nanoscopic slit pore, $\theta$ is estimated from
the inclination of the interfaces, as a function of the wall-fluid interaction
strength. The information on the surface tensions $\gamma_{wA}$, $\gamma_{wB}$
are obtained independently from a new thermodynamic integration method, while
$\gamma_{AB}$ is found from the finite-size scaling analysis of the
concentration distribution function. We show that Young's equation describes

demonstrate, via an exact solution, that the model provides an example of a
system with an anisotropic critical point and exhibits unusual scaling of
defect density $n$ and residual energy $Q$ for a slow linear quench. We provide
a general expression for the scaling of $n$ ($Q$) generated during a slow
power-law dynamics, characterized by a rate $\tau^{-1}$ and exponent $\alpha$,
from a gapped phase to an anisotropic quantum critical point in $d$ dimensions,
for which the energy gap $\Delta_{\vec k} \sim k_i^z$ for $m$ momentum
components ($i=1..m$) and $\sim k_i^{z'}$ for the rest $d-m$ components
($i=m+1..d$) with $z\le z'$: $n \sim \tau^{-[m + (d-m)z/z']\nu \alpha/(z\nu
\alpha +1)}$ ($Q \sim \tau^{-[(m+z)+ (d-m)z/z']\nu \alpha/(z\nu \alpha +1)}$).
These general expressions reproduce both the corresponding results for the
Kitaev model as a special case for $d=z'=2$ and $m=z=\nu=1$ and the well-known
scaling laws of $n$ and $Q$ for isotropic critical points for $z=z'$. We also
present an exact computation of all non-zero, independent, multispin
correlation functions of the Kitaev model for such a quench and discuss their
spatial dependence. For the disordered Kitaev model, where the disorder is
introduced via random choice of the link variables $D_n$ in the model's

observed t2(V)=2.3 and t3(V)=4.2 days decline times, it is one of the fastest
known novae, being rivalled only by V1500 Cyg (1975) and V838 Her (1991) among
classical novae, and U Sco among the recurrent ones. The line of sight to the
nova passes within a few degrees of the Galactic centre. The reddening of V2672
Oph is E(B-V)=1.6 +/-0.1, and its distance ~19 kpc places it on the other side
of the Galactic centre at a galacto-centric distance larger than the solar one.
The lack of an infrared counterpart for the progenitor excludes the donor star
from being a cool giant like in RS Oph or T CrB. With close similarity to U
Sco, V2672 Oph displayed a photometric plateau phase, a He/N spectrum
classification, extreme expansion velocities and triple peaked emission line
profiles during advanced decline. The full width at zero intensity of Halpha
was 12,000 km/s at maximum, and declined linearly in time with a slope very
similar to that observed in U Sco. We infer a WD mass close to the
Chandrasekhar limit and a possible final fate as a SNIa. Morpho-kinematical
modelling of the evolution of the Halpha profile suggests that the overall
structure of the ejecta is that of a prolate system with polar blobs and an
equatorial ring. The density in the prolate system appeared to decline faster
than that in the other components. V2672 Oph is seen pole-on, with an
inclination of 0+/-6 deg and an expansion velocity of the polar blobs of 4800
+900/-800 km/s. On the basis of its remarkable similarity to U Sco, we suspect
this nova may be a recurrent. Given the southern declination, the faintness at
maximum, the extremely rapid decline and its close proximity to the Ecliptic,
it is quite possible that previous outbursts of V2672 Oph have been missed.

parameters are propagated from other parameters. In this paper, we show that
despite the apparent complexity of the pattern of light curves of planetary
lensing events, the correlations between the lensing parameters can be
understood by studying how the parameters affect the characteristics of lensing
light curves such as the height and width, the caustic-crossing time scale, and
the location and duration of planetary perturbations. Based on analytic
arguments about the dependency of light curve features on the parameters, we
obtain the correlations for the two representative cases of planetary events.
We also demonstrate the applicability of the correlations to general planetary
events by actually obtaining the correlations from modelings of light curves
produced by simulations.

standardized rotation matrix is defined to transform from the conventional-
cubic-cell basis to the quantum-well-transport basis whereby effective mass

scattering vectors are all defined in their respective bases. The specific
cases of (001)-, (110)-, and (111)-oriented aluminum arsenide (AlAs) quantum

particular importance in AlAs literature. Calculations of electron confinement

width for crossover from double- to single-valley degeneracy in each system.
The notation is generalized to include miscut angles, and can be adapted to
other multi-valley systems. To help classify anisotropic inter-valley
scattering events, a new primitive unit cell is defined in momentum space which
allows one to distinguish purely in-plane inter-valley scattering events from
those that requires an out-of-plane momentum scattering component.

generalise stadium billiards. These models correspond to the free motion of a
point-particle in a region bounded by cylinders cut by planes. They are
motivated by models of particles interacting via a string-type mechanism, and
confined by hard walls. The combination of these elements may give rise to a
defocusing mechanism, similar to that in two dimensions, which allows large
chaotic regions in phase space. The remaining part of phase space is associated
with marginally stable behaviour. In fact periodic orbits in these systems
generically come in continuous parametric families, sociated with a pair of
parabolic eigen-directions: the periodic orbits are unstable in the presence of
a defocusing mechanism, but marginally stable otherwise. By performing the
stability analysis of families of periodic orbits at a nonlinear level, we
establish the conditions under which families are nonlinearly stable or
unstable. As a result, we identify regions in the parameter space of the models
which admit non-linearly stable oscillations in the form of whispering gallery
modes. Where no families of periodic orbits are stable, the billiards are
completely chaotic, i.e.\ the Lyapunov exponents of the billiard map are
non-zero.

microlensing event OGLE-2009-BLG-092/MOA-2009-BLG-137, for which the light
curve is characterized by two distinct peaks with perturbations near both
peaks. We find that the event is produced by the passage of the source
trajectory over the central perturbation regions associated with the individual
components of a wide-separation binary. The event is special in the sense that
the second perturbation, occurring $\sim 100$ days after the first, was
predicted by the real-time analysis conducted after the first peak,
demonstrating that real-time modeling can be routinely done for binary and
planetary events. With the data obtained from follow-up observations covering
the second peak, we are able to uniquely determine the physical parameters of
the lens system. We find that the event occurred on a bulge clump giant and it
was produced by a binary lens composed of a K and M-type main-sequence stars.
The estimated masses of the binary components are $M_1=0.69 \pm 0.11\ M_\odot$

that the energy-dependent spectral models obtained by the previous separate
observations were also satisfied over a wide energy range from 0.4 to ~70 keV,
simultaneously. Here, the models below ~10 keV were a combination of blackbody
(BB) and power-law (PL) functions or of two BBs wit h different temperatures at
0.6 - 7.0 keV (Morii et al. 2003), and that above ~20 keV was a PL function
(Kuiper Hermsen Mendez 2004). The combination BB + PL + PL was found to best
represent the phase-averaged spectrum. Phase-resolved spectroscopy indicated
the existence of two emission regions, one with a thermal and the other with a
non-thermal nature. The combination BB + BB + PL was also found to represent
the phase-averaged spectrum well. However, we found that this model is
physically unacceptable due to an excessively large area of the emission region
of the blackbody. Nonetheless, we found that the temperatures and radii of the
two blackbody components showed moderate correlations in the phase-resolved
spectra. The fact that the same correlations have been observed between the
phase-averaged spectra of various magnetars (Nakagawa et al. 2009) suggests
that a self-similar function can approximate the intrinsic energy spectra of
magnetars below ~10 keV.

significant deviations between the models, reaching from important qualitative

of three length scales: (i) length scale of the FFLO instability; (ii) 2D
system size; (iii) length scale associated with the orbital effect caused
either by the Fermi condensate rotation or magnetic field component applied
perpendicular to the superconducting disc. We have studied this interplay and
resulting quantum oscillation effects in both superconducting and superfluid
finite -- size systems with FFLO instability and described the hallmarks of the
FFLO phenomenon in a restricted geometry. The finite size of the system is
shown to affect strongly the conditions of the observability of switching
between the states with different vorticities.

anisotropic superconductors in tilted magnetic fields are studied for the
limits of moderate and strong anisotropy. The energetically favorable shape of
isolated vortex lines is found in the framework of two particular models
describing these limiting cases: London theory with an anisotropic mass tensor
and London-type model for a stack of Josephson--decoupled superconducting
layers. The increase of the field tilting is shown to result in qualitative
changes in the vortex--vortex interaction potential: the balance between
long--range attractive and repulsive forces occurs to be responsible for a
formation of a minimum of the interaction potential vs the intervortex
distance. This minimum appears to exist only for a certain restricted range of
the vortex tilting angles which shrinks with the decrease of the system
anisotropy parameter. Tilted vortices with such unusual interaction potential
form clusters with the size depending on the field tilting angle and film
thickness or/and can arrange into multiquanta flux lattice. The magnetic flux
through the unit cells of the corresponding flux line lattices equals to an
integer number $M$ of flux quanta. Thus, the increase in the field tilting
should be accompanied by the series of the phase transitions between the vortex
lattices with different $M$.

removing (slightly less than) $m/2$ edges. On the other hand, there are many

necessary to remove roughly $m/2$ edges in order to eliminate all triangles. It
is proved that dense graphs that are hard to make triangle-free, have a large

to the clock models with $q\geq6$ for which the helicity modulus vanishes. This
means that the transition for the five-state clock model differs from the

identify a large class of trigraphs for which list homomorphism problems do

in particular, include all trigraphs whose underlying graphs are trees. In
fact, we show that for these tree-like trigraphs, the trigraph list

the gravitational potential and we give it in a form suitable to be used in
dynamical studies. The estimation is done directly from near-infrared
observations. Since the 3D distribution of the luminous matter is unknown, we
construct three different general models for the potential corresponding to
three different assumptions for the geometry of the system, representing
limiting cases. A pure 2D disc, a cylindrical geometry (thick disc) and a third
case, where a spherical geometry is assumed to apply for the major part of the
bar. For the potential of the disc component on the galactic plane a Fourier
decomposition method is used, that allows us to express it as a sum of
trigonometric terms. Both even and odd components are considered, so that the
estimated potential accounts also for the observed asymmetries in the
morphology. For the amplitudes of the trigonometric terms a smoothed cubic
interpolation scheme is used. The total potential in each model may include two
additional terms (Plummer spheres) representing a central mass concentration
and a dark halo component, respectively. In all examined models, the relative
force perturbation points to a strongly nonlinear gravitational field, which
ranges from 0.45 to 0.8 of the axisymmetric background with the pure 2D being
the most nonlinear one. We present the topological distributions of the stable
and unstable Lagrangian points as a function of the pattern speed $(\Omega_p)$.
In all three models there is a range of $\Omega_p$ values, where we find
multiple stationary points whose stability affects the overall dynamics of the

enforce global objectives only by charging the players for the resources they

quantitatively which cases reproduce specific features of NGC 1300 in an

Schwarzschild type technique. By this method we vary the weights of the various

minimize the differences between the response density and that deduced from the

mechanism to alleviate the effect of broadcast storm problem (BSP) in mobile ad
hoc networks (MANETs). Many research studies have been carried-out to develop
and evaluate the performance of this mechanism in an error-free (noiseless)
environment. In reality, wireless communication channels in MANETs are an
error-prone and suffer from high packet-loss due to presence of noise, i.e.,
noisy environment. In this paper, we propose a simulation model that can be
used to evaluate the performance of probabilistic broadcast for flooding in
noisy environment. In the proposed model, the noise-level is represented by a
generic name, probability of reception (pc) (0<=pc<=1), where pc=1 for
noiseless and <1 for noisy environment. The effect of noise is determined
randomly by generating a random number \zeta (0<=\zeta<1); if \zeta<=pc means
the packet is successfully delivered to the receiving node, otherwise,
unsuccessful delivery occurs. The proposed model is implemented on a MANET
simulator, namely, MANSim. The effect of noise on the performance of
probabilistic algorithm was investigated in four scenarios. The main
conclusions of these scenarios are: the performance of probabilistic algorithm
suffers in presence of noise. However, this suffering is less in high density
networks, or if the nodes characterized by high retransmission probability or
large radio transmission range. The nodes' speed has no or insignificant effect
on the performance.

  Let S be the minimal desingularization of \bar{S} (which has 48 isolated

of the Picard group of S, including its structure as a Galois module over Q.
The main ingredient for showing that the known subgroup is actually the full

criteria on some grouping attribute(s) of the nodes. One important attribute
that is largely ignored by most of the existing multi-hop clustering protocols
is the reliability of the communication links between the nodes. In this paper,
we suggest an adaptive and completely distributed multi-hop clustering protocol
that incorporates different notions of reliability of the communication links,
among other things, into a composite metric and uses it in all phases of the
clustering process. The joining criteria for the nodes, which lie at one hop
from the elected cluster heads, to a particular cluster not only consider the
reliability of their communication link with their cluster head but also other
important attributes. The nodes that lie outside the communication range of
cluster heads become cluster members transitively through existing cluster
members utilizing the end-to-end notion of link reliability, between the nodes
and the cluster heads, along with other important attributes. Similarly,
inter-cluster communication paths are selected using a set of criteria that
includes the end-to-end communication link reliability with the sink node along
with other important node and network attributes. We believe that incorporating
link reliability in all phases of clustering process results in an efficient
multi-hop communication hierarchy that has the potential of bringing down the
total communication costs in the network.

due to sparsity, however it is not practical to solve the $\ell_0$ minimization
problem. Commonly used techniques include $\ell_1$ minimization, such as Basis
Pursuit (BP) and greedy pursuit algorithms such as Orthogonal Matching Pursuit
(OMP) and Subspace Pursuit (SP). This manuscript proposes a novel semi-greedy
recovery approach, namely A* Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (A*OMP). A*OMP
performs A* search to look for the sparsest solution on a tree whose paths grow
similar to the Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithm. Paths on the tree
are evaluated according to a cost function, which should compensate for
different path lengths. For this purpose, three different auxiliary structures
are defined, including novel dynamic ones. A*OMP also incorporates pruning
techniques which enable practical applications of the algorithm. Moreover, the
adjustable search parameters provide means for a complexity-accuracy trade-off.
We demonstrate the reconstruction ability of the proposed scheme on both
synthetically generated data and images using Gaussian and Bernoulli
observation matrices, where A*OMP yields less reconstruction error and higher
exact recovery frequency than BP, OMP and SP. Results also indicate that novel
dynamic cost functions provide improved results as compared to a conventional
choice.

that an extension of Uhrig's dynamical decoupling (UDD) sequence can (in
theory) lock an arbitrary but known two-qubit entangled state to the $N$th
order using a sequence of $N$ control pulses [Mukhtar et al., Phys. Rev. A 81,
012331 (2010)]. By nesting three layers of explicitly constructed UDD
sequences, here we first consider the protection of unknown two-qubit states as
superposition of two known basis states, without making assumptions of the
system-environment coupling. It is found that the obtained decoherence
suppression can be highly sensitive to the ordering of the three UDD layers and
can be remarkably effective with the correct ordering. The detailed theoretical
results are useful for general understanding of the nature of controlled
quantum dynamics under nested UDD. As an extension of our three-layer UDD, it
is finally pointed out that a completely unknown two-qubit state can be
protected by nesting four layers of UDD sequences. This work indicates that
when UDD is applicable (e.g., when environment has a sharp frequency cut-off
and when control pulses can be taken as instantaneous pulses), dynamical
decoupling using nested UDD sequences is a powerful approach for entanglement
protection.

different cultures. The 'true' (or myopic) self-avoiding walk model (TSAW) was
introduced in the physics literature by Amit, Parisi and Peliti. This is a
nearest neighbor non-Markovian random walk in Z^d which prefers to jump to
those neighbors which were less visited in the past. The self-repelling
Brownian polymer model (SRBP), initiated in the probabilistic literature by
Durrett and Rogers (independently of the physics community), is the continuous
space-time counterpart: a diffusion in R^d pushed by the negative gradient of
the (mollified) occupation time measure of the process. In both cases, similar
long memory effects are caused by a pathwise self-repellency of the
trajectories due to a push by the negative gradient of (softened) local time.
We investigate the asymptotic behaviour of TSAW and SRBP in the non-recurrent
dimensions. First, we identify a natural stationary (in time) and ergodic
distribution of the environment (the local time profile) as seen from the
moving particle. The main results are diffusive limits. In the case of TSAW,
for a wide class of self-interaction functions, we establish diffusive lower
and upper bounds for the displacement and for a particular, more restricted
class of interactions, we prove full CLT for the finite dimensional
distributions of the displacement. In the case of SRBP, we prove full CLT
without restrictions on the interaction functions. These results settle part of
the conjectures, based on non-rigorous renormalization group arguments (equally
'valid' for the TSAW and SRBP cases). The proof of the CLT follows the
non-reversible version of Kipnis-Varadhan theory. On the way to the proof, we
slightly weaken the so-called graded sector condition.

morphological features of NGC 1300 among a large number of models, as became
evident in a previous study. Our main result is the discovery of three new
dynamical mechanisms that can support structures in a barred-spiral grand
design system. These mechanisms are presented in characteristic cases, where
these dynamical phenomena take place. They refer firstly to the support of a
strong bar, of ansae type, almost solely by chaotic orbits, then to the support
of spirals by chaotic orbits that for a certain number of pat tern revolutions
follow an n:1 (n=7,8) morphology, and finally to the support of spiral arms by
a combination of orbits trapped around L$_{4,5}$ and sticky chaotic orbits with
the same Jacobi constant. We have encountered these dynamical phenomena in a
large fraction of the cases we studied as we varied the parameters of our
general models, without forcing in some way their appearance. This suggests
that they could be responsible for the observed morphologies of many
barred-spiral galaxies. Comparing our response models among themselves we find
that the NGC 130 0 morphology is best described by a thick disc model for the
bar region and a 2D disc model for the spirals, with both components rotating
with the same pattern speed $\Omega_p$=16 \ksk !. In such a case, the whole
structure is included inside the corotation of the system. The bar is supported
mainly by regular orbits, while the spirals are supported by chaotic orbits.

evaluation that includes standard branching schemes such as 2-way, d-way, and
dichotomic domain splitting, as well as variations of set branching where
branching is performed on sets of values. We also propose and evaluate a
generic approach to set branching where the partition of a domain into sets is
created using the scores assigned to values by a value ordering heuristic, and
a clustering algorithm from machine learning. Experimental results demonstrate
that although exponential differences between branching schemes, as predicted
in theory between 2-way and d-way branching, are not very common, still the
choice of branching scheme can make quite a difference on certain classes of
problems. Set branching methods are very competitive with 2-way branching and
outperform it on some problem classes. A statistical analysis of the results

solving nonsmooth equations. Based on advanced techniques of variational
analysis and generalized differentiation, we establish the well-posedness of
the algorithm, its local superlinear convergence, and its global convergence of
the Kantorovich type. Our convergence results hold with no semismoothness
assumption, which is illustrated by examples. The algorithm and main results

CIB emission as a function of redshift, is still not well known. Our goal is to
measure the CIB history at 70 {\mu}m and 160 {\mu}m at different redshifts, and
provide constraints for infrared galaxy evolution models. We use complete deep
Spitzer 24 {\mu}m catalogs down to about 80 {\mu}Jy, with spectroscopic and
photometric redshifts identifications, from the GOODS and COSMOS deep infrared
surveys covering 2 square degrees total. After cleaning the Spitzer/MIPS 70
{\mu}m and 160 {\mu}m maps from detected sources, we stacked the far-IR images
at the positions of the 24 {\mu}m sources in different redshift bins. We
measured the contribution of each stacked source to the total 70 and 160 {\mu}m
light, and compare with model predictions and recent far-IR measurements made
with Herschel/PACS on smaller fields. We have detected components of the 70 and
160 {\mu}m backgrounds in different redshift bins up to z ~ 2. The contribution
to the CIB is maximum at 0.3 <= z <= 0.9 at 160{\mu}m (and z <= 0.5 at 70
{\mu}m). A total of 81% (74%) of the 70 (160) {\mu}m background was emitted at
z < 1. We estimate that the AGN relative contribution to the far-IR CIB is less
than about 10% at z < 1.5. We provide a comprehensive view of the CIB buildup
at 24, 70, 100, 160 {\mu}m. IR galaxy models predicting a major contribution to
the CIB at z < 1 are in agreement with our measurements, while our results
discard other models that predict a peak of the background at higher redshifts.

this work, we first introduce a novel three-time-slot time-division duplexing
(TDD) transmission protocol. This protocol unifies direct transmission, one-way
relaying and network-coded two-way relaying between the BS and each MS. Using
the proposed three-time-slot TDD protocol, we then propose an optimization
framework for resource allocation to achieve the following gains: cooperative
diversity (via relay selection), network coding gain (via bidirectional
transmission mode selection), and multiuser diversity (via subcarrier
assignment). We formulate the problem as a combinatorial optimization problem,
which is NP-complete. To make it more tractable, we adopt a graph-based
approach. We first establish the equivalence between the original problem and a
maximum weighted clique problem in graph theory. A metaheuristic algorithm
based on any colony optimization (ACO) is then employed to find the solution in
polynomial time. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed protocol
together with the ACO algorithm significantly enhances the system total

match the needs of user and keep their attention in their web site. So, only
option is to capture the intuition of the user and provide them with the
recommendation list. Most specifically, an online navigation behavior grows
with each passing day, thus extracting information intelligently from it is a
difficult issue. Web master should use web usage mining method to capture
intuition. A WUM is designed to operate on web server logs which contain user's
navigation. Hence, recommendation system using WUM can be used to forecast the
navigation pattern of user and recommend those to user in a form of
recommendation list. In this paper, we propose a two tier architecture for
capturing users intuition in the form of recommendation list containing pages
visited by user and pages visited by other user's having similar usage profile.
The practical implementation of proposed architecture and algorithm shows that
accuracy of user intuition capturing is improved.

by seeing limited performance at this plate-scale brings the system into the

in industrial manufacturing processes. The cost-benefits that may be realized
through such an approach must be offset against the robot performance, and the

to assume the low metallicity for the whole HII region. Sh~2-284 is expected to
host a significant population of Pre-Main Sequence (PMS) stars of both low and
intermediate mass stars (Herbig Ae stars). We aim at characterizing these stars
by means of a spectroscopic and photometric survey conducted with VIMOS@VLT and
complemented with additional optical and infrared observations. In this survey
we selected and characterized 23 PMS objects. We derived the effective
temperature, the spectral energy distribution and luminosity of these objects;
using theoretical PMS evolutionary tracks, with the appropriate metallicity, we
estimated the mass and the age of the studied objects. We also estimated a
distance of 4 Kpc for Sh 2-284 by using spectroscopic parallax of 3 OB stars.
From the age determination we concluded that triggered star formation is in act
in this region. Our results show that a significant fraction of the young
stellar objects (YSOs) may have preserved their disk/envelopes, in contrast
with what is found in other recent studies of low-metallicity star forming
regions in the Galaxy. Finally, among the 23 bona fide PMS stars, we identified
8 stars which are good candidates to pulsators of the delta Scuti type.

light rays through two-dimensional photonic crystals when slow spatial
modulation of the lattice parameters induces mixed stable-chaotic ray dynamics.
This modulation changes both the shape and frequency range of the allowed
frequency bands, thereby bending the resulting semiclassical ray trajectories
and confining them within particular regions of the crystal. The curved
boundaries of these regions, combined with the bending of the orbits
themselves, creates a hierarchy of stable and unstable chaotic trajectories in
phase space. For certain lattice parameters and electromagnetic wave
frequencies, islands of stable orbits act as a dynamical barrier, which
separates the chaotic trajectories into two distinct regions of the crystal,
thereby preventing the rays propagating through the structure. We show that
changing the frequency of the light strongly affects the distribution of stable
and unstable orbits in both real and phase space. This switches the dynamical
barriers on and off and thus modulates the transmission of rays through the
crystal. We propose microwave analogues of the photonic crystals as a route to
the experimental study of the transport effects that we predict.

assess biomarkers i.e. species almost exclusively associated with life, in
present-day and in 10% present atmospheric level oxygen atmospheres
corresponding to the Earth's Proterozoic period. We investigate the impact of
proposed enhanced microbial emissions of the biomarker nitrous oxide, which
photolyses to form nitrogen oxides which can destroy the biomarker ozone. A
major result of our work is regardless of the microbial activity producing
nitrous oxide in the early anoxic ocean, a certain minimum ozone column can be
expected to persist in Proterozoic-type atmospheres due to a stabilising
feedback loop between ozone, nitrous oxide and the ultraviolet radiation field.
Atmospheric nitrous oxide columns were enhanced by a factor of 51 for the
Proterozoic ""Canfield ocean"" scenario with 100 times increased nitrous oxide
surface emissions. In such a scenario nitrous oxide displays prominent spectral
features, so may be more important as a biomarker than previously considered in
such cases. The run with ""Canfield ocean"" nitrous oxide emissions enhanced by a
factor of 100 also featured additional surface warming of 3.5K. Our results
suggest that the Proterozoic ozone layer mostly survives the changes in

5.8um, and r'(Vega)>23. The entire sample was observed with the low resolution
units of the Spitzer/IRS infrared spectrograph. These sources have 1.2mm
observations with IRAM 30m/MAMBO and very deep 20cm observations from the VLA.
Nine of our sources also benefit from 350um observation and detection from
CSO/SHARC-II. The entire sample shows good quality IRS spectra dominated by
strong PAH features. The main PAH features at 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, and 11.3um have
high S/N average luminosities of 2.90, 10.38, 3.62, and 2.29x10^{10}Lsun,

average of these redshifts is 2.017. This result confirms that the selection
criteria of ""5.8um-peakers"" associated with a strong detection at 24um are
reliable to select sources at z~2. We have analyzed the different correlations
between PAH emission and infrared, millimeter, and radio emission. Practically
all our sources are strongly dominated by starburst emission. We have also
defined two subsamples based on the equivalent width at 7.7um to investigate
AGN contributions. Our sample contains strong starbursts and represents a
particularly 24um-bright class of SMGs. The very good correlation between PAH
and far-IR luminosities is now confirmed in high-z starburst ULIRGs. These
sources show a small AGN contribution to the mid-IR, around ~20% in most cases.

an important role in redistributing mass, energy and angular momentum within
the dense core and parent cloud. The interplay between magnetic field and
rotation is responsible for launching these outflows, whose formation has been
generally carried out for idealized systems where the angle $\alpha$ between
the rotation axis and large-scale magnetic field is zero. Here we explore,
through three-dimensional ideal magneto-hydrodynamic simulations, the effects
of a non-zero $\alpha$ on the formation of outflows during the collapse of
dense pre-stellar cores. We find that mass ejection is less efficient for
increasing angle $\alpha$, and that outflows are essentially suppressed for
$\alpha\sim90^{\circ}$. An important consequence is a corresponding increase of
the mass accreted onto the adiabatic (first) core. In addition, mean flow
velocities tend to increase with $\alpha$, and misaligned configurations
produce clumpy, heterogeneous outflows that undergo precession, and are more
prone to instabilities.

as a (classical) fixed background, is performed in the context of a pure
Yang-Mills formulation for gravity in a $2+1$ dimensional space-time. In the
massless case we show that the theory contains three degrees of freedom and
only one is a non-unitary mode. Next, we introduce quadratical terms dependent
on torsion, which preserve parity and general covariance. The linearized
version reproduces an analogue Hilbert-Einstein-Fierz-Pauli unitary massive
theory plus three massless modes, two of them represents non-unitary ones.
Finally we confirm the existence of a family of unitary Yang-Mills-extended
theories which are classically consistent with Einstein's solutions coming from
non massive and topologically massive gravity. The unitarity of these
YM-extended theories is shown in a perturbative regime. A possible way to
perform a non-perturbative study is remarked.

How this
collective period is established is a key question in understanding biological
clocks. We explore this question in the segmentation clock, a population of
coupled cellular oscillators in the vertebrate embryo that sets the rhythm of
somitogenesis, the morphological segmentation of the body axis. The oscillating
cells of the zebrafish segmentation clock are thought to possess noisy
autonomous periods, which are synchronized by intercellular coupling through
the Delta-Notch pathway. Here we ask whether Delta-Notch coupling additionally
influences the collective period of the segmentation clock. Using
multiple-embryo time-lapse microscopy, we show that disruption of Delta-Notch
intercellular coupling increases the period of zebrafish somitogenesis.
Embryonic segment length and the spatial wavelength of oscillating gene
expression also increase correspondingly, indicating an increase in the
segmentation clock's period. Using a theory based on phase oscillators in which
the collective period self-organizes because of time delays in coupling, we
estimate the cell-autonomous period, the coupling strength, and the coupling
delay from our data. Further supporting the role of coupling delays in the
clock, we predict and experimentally confirm an instability resulting from
decreased coupling delay time. Synchronization of cells by Delta-Notch coupling
regulates the collective period of the segmentation clock. Our identification
of the first segmentation clock period mutants is a critical step toward a
molecular understanding of temporal control in this system. We propose that
collective control of period via delayed coupling may be a general feature of
biological clocks.

of practical interest. We investigate the dynamics of entanglement for
different degrees of anisotropy of the system and at both zero and finite
temperatures. We find that the time evolution of entanglement in the system
show non-ergodic and critical behavior at zero and finite temperatures and
different degrees of anisotropy. The asymptotic behavior of entanglement at the
infinite time limit at zero temperature and constant J and h depends only the
parameter lambda=J/h rather than the individual values of J and h for all
degrees of anisotropy but changes for nonzero temperature. Furthermore, the
asymptotic behavior is very sensitive to the initial values of J and h and for
particular choices we may create finite asymptotic entanglement regardless of
the final values of J and h. The persistence of quantum effects in the system
as it evolves and as the temperature is raised is studied by monitoring the
entanglement. We find that the quantum effects dominates within certain regions
of the kT-lambda space that vary significantly depending on the degree of the
anisotropy of the system. Particularly, the quantum effects in the Ising model
case persists in the vicinity of both its critical phase transition point and
zero temperature as it evolves in time. Moreover, the interplay between the
different system parameters to tune and control the entanglement evolution is

the UQ objectives and the assumptions/information set are brought to the
forefront. This framework, which we call \emph{Optimal Uncertainty
Quantification} (OUQ), is based on the observation that, given a set of
assumptions and information about the problem, there exist optimal bounds on
uncertainties: these are obtained as values of well-defined optimization
problems corresponding to extremizing probabilities of failure, or of
deviations, subject to the constraints imposed by the scenarios compatible with
the assumptions and information. In particular, this framework does not
implicitly impose inappropriate assumptions, nor does it repudiate relevant
information. Although OUQ optimization problems are extremely large, we show
that under general conditions they have finite-dimensional reductions. As an
application, we develop \emph{Optimal Concentration Inequalities} (OCI) of
Hoeffding and McDiarmid type. Surprisingly, these results show that
uncertainties in input parameters, which propagate to output uncertainties in
the classical sensitivity analysis paradigm, may fail to do so if the transfer
functions (or probability distributions) are imperfectly known. We show how,
for hierarchical structures, this phenomenon may lead to the non-propagation of
uncertainties or information across scales. In addition, a general algorithmic
framework is developed for OUQ and is tested on the Caltech surrogate model for
hypervelocity impact and on the seismic safety assessment of truss structures,
suggesting the feasibility of the framework for important complex systems. The
introduction of this paper provides both an overview of the paper and a
self-contained mini-tutorial about basic concepts and issues of UQ.

production channel, gluon-gluon fusion into a Higgs boson. Since then, a note
from the Higgs working groups of the CDF and D0 collaborations criticizing our
modeling of the $gg\to H$ cross section has appeared. In this addendum, we
answer to this criticism point by point and, in particular, perform an analysis
of $\sigma(gg\to H)$ for a central value of the renormalization and
factorization scales $\mu_0=\frac12 M_H$ for which higher order corrections
beyond next-to-next-to-leading order (that we discarded in our previous
