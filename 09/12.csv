two-dimensional central fraction of dark over total mass and dark matter
density as a function of stellar mass, central stellar velocity dispersion,
effective radius, and central surface stellar mass density. We use a sample of
~ 1.7 x 10^5 galaxies from the SDSS DR7 at redshift smaller than 0.33. We apply
conservative photometric and spectroscopic cuts to select galaxies with
physical properties similar to those of the lenses studied in the SLACS Survey.
The values of the galaxy stellar and total mass projected inside a cylinder of
radius equal to the effective radius are obtained, respectively, by fitting the
SDSS multicolor photometry with stellar population synthesis models, under the
assumption of a Chabrier stellar IMF, and adopting a one-component isothermal
total mass model with effective velocity dispersion approximated by the central
stellar velocity dispersion. We find that within the effective radius the
stellar mass estimates differ from the total ones by only a relatively constant
proportionality factor. In detail, we observe that the values of the projected
fraction of dark over total mass and the logarithmic values of the central
surface dark matter density (measured in M_{Sun} kpc^{-2}) have almost Gaussian
probability distribution functions, with median values of 0.64^{+0.08}_{-0.11}
and 9.1^{+0.2}_{-0.2}, respectively. Our results disfavor an interpretation of
the tilt of the FP in terms of differences in the galaxy dark matter content
and give useful information on the possible variations of the galaxy stellar
IMF and dark matter density profile. Finally, we provide some observational
evidence on the likely significant contribution of dry minor mergers, feedback
from active galactic nuclei, and/or coalescence of binary black holes on the
formation and evolution of massive early-type galaxies.

a top-down multilevel tumor dynamics modeling method primarily based on
discrete entity consideration and manipulation. The method is clinically
oriented, one of its major goals being to support patient individualized
treatment optimization through experimentation in silico (=on the computer).
Therefore, modeling of the treatment response of clinical tumors lies at the
epicenter of the approach. Macroscopic data, including i.a. anatomic and
metabolic tomographic images of the tumor, provide the framework for the
integration of data and mechanisms pertaining to lower and lower biocomplexity
levels such as clinically approved cellular and molecular biomarkers. The
method also provides a powerful framework for the investigation of multilevel
(multiscale) tumor biology in the generic investigational context. The
Oncosimulator, a multiscale physics and biomedical engineering concept and
construct tightly associated with the method and currently undergoing clinical
adaptation, optimization and validation, is also sketched. A brief outline of
the approach is provided in natural language. Two specific models of tumor
response to chemotherapeutic and radiotherapeutic schemes are briefly outlined
and indicative results are presented in order to exemplify the application
potential of the method. The chapter concludes with a discussion of several
important aspects of the method including i.a. numerical analysis aspects,
technological issues, model extensions and validation within the framework of
actual running clinico-genomic trials. Future perspectives and challenges are
also addressed.

secondary protons, the creation of recoil protons and heavy recoil nuclei as
well as lateral scattering of these contributions. The buildup, which is
experimentally observed in higher energy depth dose curves, is modeled by
inclusion of two different origins: 1. Secondary reaction protons with a
contribution of ca. 65 % of the buildup (for monoenergetic protons). 2. Landau
tails as well as Gaussian type of fluctuations for range straggling effects.
All parameters of the model for initially monoenergetic proton beams have been
obtained from Monte Carlo calculations or checked by them. Furthermore, there
are a few parameters, which can be obtained by fitting the model to measured
depth dose curves in order to describe individual characteristics of the
beamline - the most important being the initial energy spread. We find that the
free parameters of the depth dose model can be predicted for any intermediate

feasibility in a much more general class of SDPs than previous result. Another
advantage is the design of the oracle which is necessary for applying the
multiplicative weight update method is much simplified in general cases. This
leads to an alternative and easier solutions to the SDPs used in the previous

step in our solution, we are able to solve a class of SDPs in \class{NC}.
Although our motivation is from quantum computing, our result will also apply
directly to any SDP which satisfies our conditions. In addition to the new
framework for solving SDPs, we also provide a novel framework which improves
the range of equilibrium value problems that can be solved via the
multiplicative weight update method. Before this work we are only able to
calculate the equilibrium value where one of the two convex sets needs to be
the set of density operators. Our work demonstrates that in the case when one
set is the set of density operators with further linear constraints, we are
still able to approximate the equilibrium value to high precision via the

involve usage of sintered compounds. The critical current density and the
ability to trap high magnetic flux inside the sample depend largely on the
quality of the GBs. Zn has the ability to pin vortices but it also degrades
superconductivity. In this study we have investigated the effect of Zn impurity
on the intergrain coupling properties in high-quality La2-xSrxCu1-yZnyO4
sintered samples with different hole concentrations, p (\equiv x), over a wide
range of Zn contents (y) using field-dependent ac susceptibility (ACS)
measurements. The ACS results enabled us to determine the superconducting
transition temperature Tc, and the temperature Tgcp, at which the randomly
oriented superconducting grains become coupled as a function of hole and
disorder contents. We have analyzed the behavior of the GBs from the systematic
evolution of the values of Tgcp(p, y), Tc(p, y), and from the contribution to
the field-dependent ACS signal coming from the intergrain shielding current. Zn
suppresses both Tc and Tgcp in a similar fashion. The hole content and the
carrier localization due to Zn substitution seem to have significant effect on
the coupling properties of the GBs. We have discussed the possible implications

identify settings in which noise-free recovery techniques deteriorate

statistically significant filaments. We find that $L_{\rm MAX}$ varies in the
range $100-130 \, h^{-1} {\rm Mpc}$ across the 11 slices, with a mean value
$L_{\rm MAX}=110 \pm 12 \, h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$. Longer filaments, though possibly
present in our data, are not statistically significant and are the outcome of

including all N^kMHV partial amplitudes to all loops - is equivalent to the
correlation function of a supersymmetric Wilson loop in twistor space.
Remarkably, the entire classical S-matrix arises from evaluating the
correlation function in the self-dual sector, while the expansion of the
correlation function in powers of the Yang-Mills coupling constant provides the
loop expansion of the amplitudes. We support our proposal with explicit
computations of the n particle NMHV and NNMHV trees, the integrands of the
1-loop MHV and NMHV amplitudes, and the n particle 2-loop MHV amplitude. These
calculations are performed using the twistor action in axial gauge. In this
gauge, the Feynman diagrams of the correlation function are the planar duals of
the usual MHV diagrams for the scattering amplitude. The results are presented
in the form of a sum of products of dual superconformal invariants in
(momentum) twistor space, and agree with the expressions derived in
arXiv:1009.1854 directly from the MHV rules. The twistor space Wilson loop is a
natural supersymmetric generalization of the standard Wilson loop used to
compute MHV amplitudes. We show how the Penrose-Ward transform can be used to
determine a corresponding supersymmetrization on space-time.

the crust-core transition is not first order, and for all subsaturation
densities matter can be viewed as a continuous fluid mixture between free
nucleons and massive nuclei. As a consequence, the equations of state and the
associated observables do not present any discontinuity over the whole
thermodynamic range. We further investigate the nuclear matter composition over
a wide range of densities and temperatures. At high density and temperature our
model accounts for a much larger mass fraction bound in medium nuclei with
respect to traditional approaches as Lattimer-Swesty, with sizeable
consequences on the thermodynamic quantities. The equations of state agree well
with the presently used EOS only at low temperatures and in the homogeneous
matter phase, while important differences are present in the crust-core

significance as a neat way of representing quantum convolutional codes, they
are not well-suited to practical realization. In fact, there is no
straightforward way to implement any given pearl-necklace structure. This paper
closes the gap between theoretical representation and practical implementation.
In our previous work, we presented an efficient algorithm for finding a
minimal-memory realization of a pearl-necklace encoder for
Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) convolutional codes. This work extends our
previous work and presents an algorithm for turning a pearl-necklace encoder
for a general (non-CSS) quantum convolutional code into a realizable quantum
convolutional encoder. We show that a minimal-memory realization depends on the
commutativity relations between the gate strings in the pearl-necklace encoder.
We find a realization by means of a weighted graph which details the
non-commutative paths through the pearl-necklace. The weight of the longest
path in this graph is equal to the minimal amount of memory needed to implement
the encoder. The algorithm has a polynomial-time complexity in the number of
gate strings in the pearl-necklace encoder.

between glial cells and neuron-glia interactions should be considered together
with neurons and their networks to understand higher brain functions. In
particular, astrocytes, the main type of glial cells in the cortex, have been
shown to communicate with neurons and with each other. They are thought to form
a gap-junction-coupled syncytium supporting cell-cell communication via
propagating Ca2+ waves. An identified mode of propagation is based on
cytoplasm-to-cytoplasm transport of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) through gap
junctions that locally trigger Ca2+ pulses via IP3-dependent Ca2+-induced Ca2+
release. It is, however, currently unknown whether this intracellular route is
able to support the propagation of long-distance regenerative Ca2+ waves or is
restricted to short-distance signaling. Furthermore, the influence of the
intracellular signaling dynamics on intercellular propagation remains to be
understood. In this work, we propose a model of the gap-junctional route for
intercellular Ca2+ wave propagation in astrocytes showing that: (1)
long-distance regenerative signaling requires nonlinear coupling in the gap
junctions, and (2) even with nonlinear gap junctions, long-distance
regenerative signaling is favored when the internal Ca2+ dynamics implements
frequency modulation-encoding oscillations with pulsating dynamics, while
amplitude modulation-encoding dynamics tends to restrict the propagation range.
As a result, spatially heterogeneous molecular properties and/or weak couplings
are shown to give rise to rich spatiotemporal dynamics that support complex
propagation behaviors. These results shed new light on the mechanisms
implicated in the propagation of Ca2+ waves across astrocytes and precise the
conditions under which glial cells may participate in information processing in
the brain.
