two frequency subsets are expected to be visible : a regular frequency subset

networks with one-hop traffic. The main contribution of this paper is to
propose Unlocking CSMA (U-CSMA) policy that enables to obtain high throughput
with low (average) packet delay for large wireless networks. In particular, the
delay under U-CSMA policy becomes order-optimal. For one-hop traffic, delay is
defined to be order-optimal if it is O(1), i.e., it stays bounded, as the
network-size increases to infinity. Using mean field theory techniques, we
analytically show that for torus (grid-like) interference topologies with
one-hop traffic, to achieve a network load of $\rho$, the delay under U-CSMA
policy becomes $O(1/(1-\rho)^{3})$ as the network-size increases, and hence,
delay becomes order optimal. We conduct simulations for general random
geometric interference topologies under U-CSMA policy combined with congestion
control to maximize a network-wide utility. These simulations confirm that
order optimality holds, and that we can use U-CSMA policy jointly with
congestion control to operate close to the optimal utility with a low packet
delay in arbitrarily large random geometric topologies. To the best of our
knowledge, it is for the first time that a simple distributed scheduling policy
is proposed that in addition to throughput/utility-optimality exhibits delay
order-optimality.

early ingress compared to the optical transit. We suggest that the resulting
early ingress is caused by a bow shock ahead of the planetary orbital motion.
In this Letter we investigate the conditions that might lead to the formation
of such a bow shock. We consider two scenarios: (1) the stellar magnetic field
is strong enough to confine the hot coronal plasma out to the planetary orbit
and (2) the stellar magnetic field is unable to confine the plasma, which
escapes in a wind. In both cases, a shock capable of compressing plasma to the
observed densities will form around the planet for plasma temperatures T < (4 -
5) x 10^6 K. In the confined case, the shock always forms directly ahead of the
planet, but in the wind case the shock orientation depends on the wind speed
and hence on the plasma temperature. For higher wind temperatures, the shock
forms closer to the line of centers between the planet and the star. We
conclude that shock formation leading to an observable early UV ingress is
likely to be a common feature of transiting systems and may prove to be a
useful tool in setting limits on planetary magnetic field strengths Bp. In the
case of WASP-12b, we derive an upper limit of about Bp=24 G.

  perfect is a nucleonic fluid?","32 pages, 9 figures",,,,"nucl-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The viscosity of hadronic matter is studied using a classical evaluation of
the scattering angle and a quantum mechanical discussion based on phase shifts
from a potential. Semi classical limits of the quantum theory are presented. A
hard sphere and an attractive square well potential step are each considered as
well as the combined effects of both. The lowest classical value of the
viscosity for an attractive potential is shown to be a hard sphere limit. The
high wave number-short wavelength limits of the quantum result have scaling
laws associated with it for both the viscosity and entropy. These scaling laws
are similar to the Fraunhoher diffraction increase for the hard sphere
geometric cross section. Specific examples for nuclear collisions are given.
The importance of the nuclear tensor force and hard core is mentioned. The
viscosity (eta), entropy density (s) and eta/s ratio are calculated for a gas
of dilute neutrons in the unitary limit of large scattering length. Away from
the unitary limit, the ratio of the interaction radius or the scattering length
to the interparticle spacing introduces a variable y besides the fugacity z.
The isothermal compressibility is shown to impose important constraints. The
results for eta/s are compared to the AdS/CFT string theory minimum of
(1/4Pi)hbar/kb to see how close a nucleonic gas is to being a perfect fluid.
The eta/s ~1hbar/kb for a neutron gas in its unitary limit. The eta/s 3hbar/kb
treating the nuclear scattering as billiard ball collisions. The minimum eta/s
for a neutron gas occurs in regions of negative isothermal compressibility and
high fugacity where higher virial terms are important. In a neutron-proton
system higher virial terms are associated with a liquid-gas phase transition
and critical opalescent phenomena.The type of flow-laminar,vortex, turbulent-
is investigated.

by analyzing the spectral lineshape of the 408-nm 1S0->3D1 transition driven by
a standing wave of resonant light in the presence of static electric and
magnetic fields. Due to the interaction of atoms with the standing wave, the
lineshape has a characteristic polarizability-dependent distortion. A
theoretical model was used to simulate the lineshape and determine a
combination of the polarizabilities of the ground and excited states by fitting
the model to experimental data. This combination was measured with a 13%
uncertainty, only 3% of which is due to uncertainty in the simulation and
fitting procedure. The scalar and tensor polarizabilities of the state 3D1 were
measured for the first time by comparing two different combinations of
polarizabilities. We show that this technique can be applied to similar atomic

restrict explicit considerations to semiclassical regimes but have the crucial
advantage of allowing the consistent use of local internal times in
non-deparameterizable systems. Different local internal times are related
merely by gauge transformations, thereby enabling relational evolution through
turning points of non-global internal times. The main consequence of the local
nature of internal time is the necessity of its complex-valuedness, reminiscent
of but more general than non-unitarity of evolution defined for finite ranges
of time. By several general arguments, the consistency of this setting is
demonstrated. Finally, we attempt an outlook on the nature of time in highly

$\approx$1.5-2, while the angular momentum loss rate drops by a factor of
$\approx$4 as the distance decreases past the Alfv\'en surface. This reduction
in angular momentum loss is due to the interaction between the stellar and
planetary Alfv\'en surfaces, which modifies the global structure of the stellar
corona and stellar wind on the hemisphere facing the planet, as well as the
opposite hemisphere. The simulation also shows that the magnitude of change in
angular momentum loss rate depends mostly on the strength of the planetary
magnetic field and not on its polarity. The interaction however, begins at
greater separation if the overall field topology of the star and the planet are
of anti-aligned. Our results are consistent with evidence for excess angular
momentum in stars harboring close-in giant planets, and show that the reduction
in wind-driven angular momentum loss can compete with, and perhaps dominate,
spin-up due to tidal interaction.

relay.
  However, the question remains whether this freedom of selecting the
compression necessarily improves the achievable rate of the original message.
It has been shown in (El Gamal and Kim, 2010) that the answer is negative in
the single-relay case. In this paper, it is further demonstrated that in the
case of multiple relays, there is no improvement on the achievable rate by
joint decoding either. More interestingly, it is discovered that any
compressions not supporting successive decoding will actually lead to strictly
lower achievable rates for the original message. Therefore, to maximize the
achievable rate for the original message, the compressions should always be
chosen to support successive decoding. Furthermore, it is shown that any
compressions not completely decodable even with joint decoding will not provide
any contribution to the decoding of the original message.
  The above phenomenon is also shown to exist under the repetitive encoding
framework recently proposed by (Lim, Kim, El Gamal, and Chung, 2010), which
improved the achievable rate in the case of multiple relays. Here, another
interesting discovery is that the improvement is not a result of repetitive
encoding, but the benefit of delayed decoding after all the blocks have been
finished. The same rate is shown to be achievable with the simpler classical
encoding process of (Cover and El Gamal, 1979) with a block-by-block backward
decoding process.

We investigate effects on the solar cycle periods, the maximum tachocline field

  We conduct three experiments: (I) comparing very different magnetic
diffusivity profiles; (II) comparing different locations of diffusivity

different slopes of diffusivity gradient for an optimal profile.

follow the evolution of emission at different temperatures. We find that at the
apex of the high temperature loops the emission measure distribution is
strongly peaked near 4 MK and falls off sharply at both higher and lower
temperatures. Perhaps most significantly, the emission measure at 0.5 MK is
reduced by more than two orders of magnitude from the peak at 4 MK. We also
find that the temporal evolution in broad-band soft X-ray images is relatively
constant over about 6 hours of observing. Observations in the cooler SDO/AIA
bandpasses generally do not show cooling loops in the core of the active
region, consistent with the steady emission observed at high temperatures.
These observations suggest that the high temperature loops observed in the core
of an active region are close to equilibrium. We find that it is possible to
reproduce the relative intensities of high temperature emission lines with a
simple, high-frequency heating scenario where heating events occur on time
scales much less than a cooling time. In contrast, low-frequency heating
scenarios, which are commonly invoked to describe nanoflare models of coronal
heating, do not reproduce the relative intensities of high temperature emission
lines and predict low-temperature emission that is approximately an order of
magnitude too large. We also present an initial look at images from the SDO/AIA

large numbers of genes, SNPs, or other biological features tend to have large
biases when applied to data with a smaller number of features such as genes
with expression measured conventionally, proteins, and metabolites. To analyze
such small-scale and medium-scale data in an empirical Bayes framework, we
introduce corrections of maximum likelihood estimators (MLE) of the local false
discovery rate (LFDR). In this context, the MLE estimates the LFDR, which is a
posterior probability of null hypothesis truth, by estimating the prior
distribution. The corrections lie in excluding each feature when estimating one
or more parameters on which the prior depends. An application of the new
estimators and previous estimators to protein abundance data illustrates how
different estimators lead to very different conclusions about which proteins
are affected by cancer.
  The estimators are compared using simulated data of two different numbers of
features, two different detectability levels, and all possible numbers of
affected features. The simulations show that some of the corrected MLEs
substantially reduce a negative bias of the MLE. (The best-performing corrected
MLE was derived from the minimum description length principle.) However, even
the corrected MLEs have strong negative biases when the proportion of features
that are unaffected is greater than 90%. Therefore, since the number of
affected features is unknown in the case of real data, we recommend an
optimally weighted combination of the best of the corrected MLEs with a
conservative estimator that has weaker parametric assumptions.

spectrometer, of five sub-millimeter bright lensed sources selected from the
Herschel Astrophysical Terahertz Large Area Survey (H-ATLAS) science
demonstration phase (SDP) catalog. We construct a redshift finding algorithm
using combinations of the signal-to-noise of all the lines falling in the
Z-Spec bandpass to determine redshifts with high confidence, even in cases
where the signal-to-noise in individual lines is low. We measure the dust
continuum in all sources and secure CO redshifts for four out of five
(z~1.5-3). In one source, SDP.17, we tentatively identify two independent
redshifts and a water line, confirmed at z=2.308. Our sources have properties
characteristic of dusty starburst galaxies, with magnification-corrected star
formation rates of 10^(2-3) M_sun/yr. Lower limits for the dust masses (~a few
10^8 M_sun) and spatial extents (~1 kpc equivalent radius) are derived from the
continuum spectral energy distributions, corresponding to dust temperatures
between 54 and 69K. In the LTE approximation, we derive relatively low CO
excitation temperatures (< 100 K) and optical depths (tau<1). Performing a
non-LTE excitation analysis using RADEX, we find that the CO lines measured by
Z-Spec (from J=4->3 to 10->9, depending on the galaxy) localize the best
solutions to either a high-temperature / low-density region, or a
low-temperature / high-density region near the LTE solution, with the optical
depth varying accordingly. Observations of additional CO lines, CO(1-0) in
particular, are needed to constrain the non-LTE models.

curved spectrum, or a moderately steep power-law with soft excess and
high-energy downturn, is that they are an extension of the very high state, up
to luminosities ~ 1 to 3 L_{Edd}. Two competing models are Comptonization in a
warm corona, and slim disk; I suggest bulk motion Comptonization in the
radiatively-driven outflow as another possibility. The interpretation of ULXs
with a hard power-law spectrum is more problematic. Some of them remain in that
state over a large range of luminosities; others switch directly to a curved
state without going through a canonical high/soft state. I suggest that those
ULXs are in a high/hard state not seen in Galactic black holes; that state may
overlap with the low/hard state at lower accretion rates, and extend all the
way to Eddington accretion rates. If some black holes can reach Eddington
accretion rates without switching to a standard-disk-dominated state, it is
also possible that they never quench their steady jets.

contain blue straggler stars (BSs). BSs in a cluster can significantly enhance
the integrated spectrum of the host population, preferentially at short
wavelengths, and render it much bluer in photometric colours. Current
theoretical simple stellar population (SSP) models constructed within the
traditional framework of single and binary stellar evolution cannot fully
account for the impact of these objects on the integrated spectral properties
of stellar populations. Using conventional SSP models without taking into
account BS contributions may significantly underestimate a cluster's age and/or
metallicity, simply because one has to balance the observed bluer colours (or a
bluer spectrum) with a younger age and/or a lower metallicity. Therefore,
inclusion of BS contributions in SSP models is an important and necessary
improvement for population synthesis and its applications. Here, we present a
new set of SSP models, which include BS contributions based on our analysis of
individual star clusters. The models cover the wavelength range from 91~{\AA}
to 160~$\mu$m, ages from 0.1 to 20 Gyr and metallicities $Z=0.0004, 0.004,
0.008, 0.02$ (solar) and 0.05. We use the observed integrated spectra of
several Magellanic Cloud star clusters to cross-check and validate our models.

Data on such oscillations are a source of information about the objects,
notably about properties of convection in their envelopes and about the systems

small amplitude variable red giants (OSARGs) in the Large Magellanic Cloud.
  We want to explain variability in OSARGs as the solar-like oscillation and to
associate the peaks in power spectra with frequencies of acoustic modes. We use
data on reddening-free magnitudes of the objects and interpret them in terms of
stellar physical parameters using tabulated isochrones calculated for ages and
composition parameters corresponding to the upper RGB of the LMC. Massive data
on the peak frequencies and amplitudes are compared with expectations for
stochastically excited oscillations. The frequencies are also compared with
those calculated for radial modes in envelope models with parameters taken from
the isochrones.
  In stars close to the tip of the RGB, the peaks in power spectra are found in
the 0.1-1.0 $\mu$Hz range, which is consistent with extrapolation of the
frequency-luminosity relation for the solar-like oscillation. The dominant
peaks occur close to the first two radial overtones. The increase in amplitude
with luminosity is slower than linear. The exponent s=0.9 is similar to what is
found from recent analysis of CoRoT data on less luminous red giants. Frequency
separations between dominant peaks are found to be smaller by about 20% than
calculated separations between these modes. After examining various
possibilities, we left this discrepancy unexplained.
  The small amplitude variability of stars at the RGB tip is likely to be
caused by a stochastic excitation of acoustic oscillations, but interpreting of

supported by differences in the spatial, kinematic and metallicity
distributions of their stars. These differences have led to the view that the
thick disk formed early via a cataclysmic event and constitutes fossil evidence
of the hierarchical growth of the Milky Way. We show here, using N-body
simulations, how a double-exponential vertical structure, with stellar
populations displaying similar dichotomies can arise purely through internal
evolution. In this picture, stars migrate radially, while retaining nearly
circular orbits, as described by Sellwood & Binney (2002). As stars move
outwards they populate a thickened component. Such stars found at the present
time in the solar neighborhood formed early in the disk's history at smaller
radii where stars are more metal-poor and alpha-enhanced, leading to the
properties observed for thick disk stars. Classifying stars as members of the
thin or thick disk by either velocity or metallicity leads to an apparent
separation in the other property as observed. This scenario is supported by the
SDSS observation that stars in the transition region do not show any
correlation between rotational velocity and metallicity. The good qualitative
agreement between our simulation and observations in the Milky Way hint that
the thick disk may be a ubiquitous galaxy feature generated by stellar
migration. Nonetheless, we cannot exclude that some fraction of the thick disk
is a fossil of a past more violent history, nor can this scenario explain thick
disks in all galaxies.

the envelope of very massive first generation star (Population III; Pop III) by
using the stellar density profile to estimate both the jet luminosity (via
accretion) and its penetrability. The jet breakout is possible even if the Pop
III star has a supergiant hydrogen envelope without mass loss, thanks to the
long-lived powerful accretion of the envelope itself. While the Pop III GRB is
estimated to be energetic, E_{gamma,iso} ~ 10^{55} erg, the supergiant envelope
hides the initial bright phase into the cocoon component, leading to a GRB with
a long duration ~ 1000(1+z) sec and an ordinary isotropic luminosity ~ 10^{52}
erg s^{-1} (~ 10^{-9} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1} at redshift z ~ 20). The
neutrino-annihilation is not effective for Pop III GRBs because of a low
central temperature, while the magnetic mechanism is viable. We also derive
analytic estimates of the breakout conditions, which are applicable to various
progenitor models. The GRB luminosity and duration are found to be very
sensitive to the core and envelope mass, providing possible probes of the first

flexible modeling of the power spectral density (PSD), and we derive the

the process, including break frequencies in the PSD. Our statistical technique
is computationally efficient, unbiased by aliasing and red noise leak, and
fully accounts for irregular sampling and measurement errors. We show that our
stochastic model provides a good approximation to the X-ray lightcurves of
galactic black holes, and the optical and X-ray lightcurves of AGN. We use the
estimated time scales of our stochastic model to recover the correlation
between characteristic time scale of the high frequency X-ray fluctuations and
black hole mass for AGN, including two new `detections' of the time scale for
Fairall 9 and NGC 5548. We find a tight anti-correlation between the black hole
mass and the amplitude of the driving noise field, which is proportional to the
amplitude of the high frequency X-ray PSD, and we estimate that this parameter
gives black hole mass estimates to within ~ 0.2 dex precision, potentially the
most accurate method for AGN yet. We also find evidence that ~ 13% of AGN
optical PSDs fall off flatter than 1 / f^2, and, similar to previous work, find
that the optical fluctuations are more suppressed on short time scales compared
to the X-rays, but are larger on long time scales, suggesting the optical
fluctuations are not solely due to reprocessing of X-rays.

agreement translates into matches higher than 97 % over a period between 4 and

For the first time, we have mapped and analyzed the 2-D kinematics of a cool
neutral outflow in a ULIRG, F10565+2448, using the integral field unit (IFU) on
Gemini North to observe the Na I D feature. At the same time we have mapped the
ionized outflow with the [NII] and H$\alpha$ emission lines. We find a systemic
rotation curve that is consistent with the rotation of the molecular disk
determined from previous CO observations. The absorption lines show evidence of
a nuclear outflow with a radial extent of at least 3 kpc, consistent with
previous observations. The strength of the Na I D lines have a strong,
spatially resolved correlation with reddening, suggesting that dust is present
in the outflow. Surprisingly, the outflow velocities of the neutral gas show a
strong asymmetry in the form of a major-axis gradient that is opposite in sign
to disk rotation. This is inconsistent with entrained material rotating along
with the galaxy or with a tilted minor-axis outflow. We hypothesize that this
unusual behavior is due to an asymmetry in the distribution of the ambient gas.
We also see evidence of asymmetric ionized outflow in the emission-line
velocity map, which appear to be decoupled from the neutral outflow. Our
results strengthen the hypothesis that ULIRG outflows differ in morphology from
those in more quiescent disk galaxies.

is a consequence of a small-data global existence result for a reduced system
of equations that is equivalent to the original system in our wave coordinate
gauge. Our analysis of the spacetime metric components is based on a framework
recently developed by Lindblad and Rodnianski, which allows us to derive
suitable estimates for tensorial systems of quasilinear wave equations with
nonlinearities that satisfy the weak null condition. Our analysis of the
electromagnetic fields, which satisfy quasilinear first-order equations, is
based on an extension of a geometric energy-method framework developed by
Christodoulou, together with a collection of pointwise decay estimates for the
Faraday tensor developed in the article. We work directly with the
electromagnetic fields, and thus avoid the use of electromagnetic potentials.

quadratic cost when the source and target measures are periodic probability
densities. This method is based on a numerical resolution of the corresponding
Monge-Amp\`ere equation. We extend the damped Newton algorithm of Loeper and
Rapetti \cite{LR} to the more general case of a non uniform density which is
relevant to the optimal transport problem, and we show that our algorithm
converges for sufficiently large damping coefficients. The main idea consists
of designing an iterative scheme where the fully nonlinear equation is
approximated by a non-constant coefficient linear elliptic PDE that we solve
numerically. We introduce several improvements and some new techniques for the
numerical resolution of the corresponding linear system. Namely, we use a Fast
Fourier Transform (FFT) method by Strain \cite{St}, which allows to increase
the efficiency of our algorithm against the standard finite difference method.
Moreover, we use a fourth order finite difference scheme to approximate the
partial derivatives involved in the nonlinear terms of the Newton algorithm,
which are evaluated once at each iteration; this leads to a significant
improvement of the accuracy of the method, but does not sacrifice its
efficiency. Finally, we present some numerical experiments which demonstrate
the robustness and efficiency of our method on several examples of image
processing, including an application to multiple sclerosis disease detection.

carrying the action of a discrete group into the periodic cyclic cohomology of
the associated convolution algebra. Furthermore, for proper \'etale groupoids,
J.-L. Tu and P. Xu provide a map between the periodic cyclic cohomology of a
gerbe twisted convolution algebra and twisted cohomology groups. Our focus will
be the convolution algebra with a product defined by a gerbe over a discrete
translation groupoid. When the action is not proper, we cannot construct an
invariant connection on the gerbe; therefore to study this algebra, we instead
develop simplicial notions related to ideas of J. Dupont to construct a
simplicial form representing the Dixmier-Douady class of the gerbe. Then by
using a JLO formula we define a morphism from a simplicial complex twisted by
this simplicial Dixmier-Douady form to the mixed bicomplex of certain matrix
algebras. Finally, we define a morphism from this complex to the mixed
bicomplex computing the periodic cyclic cohomology of the twisted convolution

the charge quasi-neutrality of unmagnetized plasmas in global scales. This

electric field which attracts the opposite charge, and this opposite charge
reduces the charge separation. Here, we report a newly discovered instability
which causes a charge separation in a rotating plasma inside of an innermost
stable circular orbit (ISCO) around a black hole. The growth rate of the
instability is smaller than that of the disk instability even in the unstable
disk region and is forbidden in the stable disk region outside of the ISCO.
However, this growth rate becomes comparable to that of the disk instability
when the plasma density is much lower than a critical density inside of the
ISCO. In such case, the charge separation instability would become apparent and
cause the charged accretion into the black hole, thus charge the hole up.

the $L_\sigma$ distance measure ($1 \leq \sigma \leq \infty$). Our main result
is an exact characterization of the probability that a particular labeled cycle
exists in this random graph. For $\sigma = 2$ and $\sigma = \infty$, we use
this characterization to derive a series which evaluates to the cycle
probability. We thus obtain an exact formula for the expected number of
Hamilton cycles in the random graph (when $\sigma = \infty$ and $\sigma = 2$).
We also consider the adjacency matrix of the random graph and derive a
recurrence relation for the expected values of the elementary symmetric
functions evaluated on the eigenvalues (and thus the determinant) of the
adjacency matrix, and a recurrence relation for the expected value of the
permanent of the adjacency matrix. The cycle probability features prominently
in these recurrence relations. We calculate these quantities for geometric
random graphs (in the $\sigma = 2$ and $\sigma = \infty$ case) with up to $20$
vertices, and compare them with the corresponding quantities for the
Erd\""{o}s-R\'{e}nyi (ER) random graph with the same edge probabilities. The
calculations indicate that the threshold for rapid growth in the number of
Hamilton cycles (as well as that for rapid growth in the permanent of the
adjacency matrix) in the GR graph is lower than in the ER graph. However, as
the number of vertices $n$ increases, the difference between the GR and ER
thresholds reduces, and in both cases, the threshold $\sim \log(n)/n$. Also, we
observe that the expected determinant can take very large values. This throws
some light on the question of the maximal determinant of symmetric $0/1$

140, and 160um using the Infrared Camera and the Far-Infrared Surveyor onboard

160um band images show a shell-like emission structure with brightness peaks at
the north east (NE) and north west (NW) boundaries, sharply outlining part of
the X-ray shell. The 140 and 160um bands are dominated by cold dust emission
from the surrounding ISM near the NE boundary. Conclusion: We conclude that the
dust emission at the NE boundary comes from the ambient cloud interacting with
the shock front, while the origin of the dust emission at the NW boundary is
rather unclear because of the absence of prominent interstellar clouds near the
corresponding region. We cannot rule out the possibility that the latter is

not know what model of new physics will actually reflect the property of the

anomalous couplings (deviation from the SM couplings), we can conclude that it
is a new physics effect. In a previous paper \cite{QKLZ09}, we gave a hadron

measured in the FeI 630 nm lines by SOT/SP, in both quiet Sun internetwork (IN)
and network regions. The inversion is carried out under the hypothesis of
MISMA, where the unresolved structure is assumed to be optically thin. We
analyze a 29.52""x31.70"" subfield carefully selected to be representative of the
properties of a 302""x162"" quiet Sun field-of-view at disk center. The inversion
code is able to reproduce the observed asymmetries in a very satisfactory way.
The inversion code interprets 25% of inverted profiles as emerging from pixels
in which both positive and negative polarities coexist. kG field strengths are
found at the base of the photosphere in both network and IN; in the case of the
latter, both kG fields and hG fields are admixed. When considering the magnetic
properties at the mid photosphere most kG fields are gone, and the statistics
is dominated by hG fields. We constrain the magnetic field of only 4.5% of the
analyzed photosphere (and this percentage reduces to 1.3% when referred to all
pixels, including those with low polarization not analyzed). The rest of the
plasma is consistent with the presence of weak fields not contributing to the
detected polarization signals. The average flux densities derived in the full
subfield and in IN regions are higher than the ones derived from the same
dataset by Milne-Eddington inversion. The existence of large asymmetries in
SOT/SP polarization profiles is uncovered. These are not negligible in quiet
Sun data. The MISMA inversion code reproduces them in a satisfactory way, and
provides a statistical description of the magnetized IN and network which
partly differs and complements the results obtained so far. From this it
follows the importance of having a complete interpretation of the line profile
shapes.

templates to extract these signals from the noise and obtain the relevant
physical parameters. This means that in the modeling of these systems we have
to take into account how the orbit of the stellar-mass compact object is
modified by the action of its own gravitational field. This effect can be
described as the action of a local force, the self-force. We present a
time-domain technique to compute the self-force for geodesic eccentric orbits
around a non-rotating massive black hole. To illustrate the method we have
applied it to a testbed model consisting of scalar charged particle orbiting a
non-dynamical black hole. A key feature of our method is that it does not
introduce a small scale associated with the stellar-mass compact object. This
is achieved by using a multidomain framework where the particle is located at
the interface between two subdomains. In this way, we just have to evolve
homogeneous wave-like equations with smooth solutions that have to be
communicated across the subdomain boundaries using appropriate junction
conditions. The numerical technique that we use to implement this scheme is the
pseudospectral collocation method. We show the suitability of this technique
for the modeling of Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals and show that it can provide
accurate results for the self-force.

the temporal signature of the signal of interest (SOI) to acquire its spatial
statistical information. It does not need any knowledge of directional
information or training sequences. However, the major problem of the existing
MPBs is that they have serious threshold effects and the thresholds will grow
as the interference power increases or even approach infinity. In particular,
this issue prevails in scenarios with structured interference, such as,
periodically repeated white noise, tones, or MAIs in multipath channels. In
this paper, we will first present the principles for designing the projection
space of the MPB which are closely correlated with the ability of suppressing
structured interference and system finite sample performance. Then a
multiple-interference-channel based matrix pair beamformer (MIC-MPB) for CDMA
systems is developed according to the principles. In order to adapt to dynamic
channels, an adaptive algorithm for the beamformer is also proposed.
Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the proposed beamformer
has a small and bounded threshold when the interference power increases.
Performance comparisons of the MIC-MPB and the existing MPBs in various

structure. We use the Schwinger bosons for representing spin operators and also
coherent-state path integral for calculating physical quantities.
Finite-temperature properties of the system are investigated by means of the
numerical Monte-Carlo simulations. Detailed phase diagram of the system is
obtained by calculating internal energy, specific heat, spin correlation
functions, etc. There are AF N\'eel, paramagnetic and spiral states. Turning on
plaquette term (i.e., the Maxwell term on a lattice) of an emergent U(1) gauge
field that flips a pair of parallel spin-singlet bonds, we found that there
appears a phase that is regarded as a deconfined spin-liquid state, though
""transition"" to this phase from the paramagnetic phase is not of second order
but a crossover. In that phase, the emergent gauge boson is a physical gapless
excitation coupled with spinons. These results support our previous study on AF
Heisenberg model on a triangular lattice at vanishing temperature.

We continue earlier modeling work, where we have shown numerically that
branching patterns arise for this system and we have analyzed this instability
by formal asymptotics for small diffusivity of the chemo-repellent. Here we are
interested in the more general situation, where the diffusivities of both the
chemo-attractant and the chemo-repellent are positive. To do so, we develop an
appropriate functional analysis framework. We apply our method to two cases.
Firstly we analyze steady states. Secondly we analyze traveling waves when
neglecting the degradation coefficient of the chemo-repellent; the unique wave
speed appears through a singularity cancelation which is the main theoretical
difficulty. This shows that in different situations the cell density takes the
shape of a plateau. The existence of steady states and traveling plateaus are a
symptom of how rich the system is and why branching instabilities can occur.
Numerical tests show that large plateaus may split into smaller ones, which
remain stable.

the present work, we continue investigating the same systems from the points of
view of localization and Nicolai mapping. The localization is studied by
changing of integration variables in the path integral, which is applicable
whether or not SUSY is explicitly broken. We examine in detail how the
integrand of the partition function with respect to the integral over the

mechanism of the localization. In SUSY matrix models, we obtain a matrix-model
generalization of the localization formula. In terms of eigenvalues of matrix
variables, we observe that eigenvalues' dynamics is governed by balance of
attractive force from the localization and repulsive force from the Vandermonde
determinant. The approach of the Nicolai mapping works even in the presence of
the external field. It enables us to compute the partition function of SUSY
matrix models for finite N (N is the rank of matrices) with arbitrary
superpotential at least in the leading nontrivial order of an expansion with

Adaptation (SARA)in a general applicative scenario with two classes of devices:
sensors that can adapt their sensing range (adjustable sensors) and sensors
that cannot (fixed sensors). In particular, SARA activates only a subset of all
the available sensors and reduces the sensing range of the adjustable sensors
that have been activated. In doing so, SARA also takes possible heterogeneous
coverage capabilities of sensors belonging to the same class into account. It
specifically addresses device heterogeneity by modeling the coverage problem in
the Laguerre geometry through Voronoi-Laguerre diagrams.
  SARA executes quickly and is guaranteed to terminate. It provides a
configuration of the active set of sensors that lifetime and coverage

entanglement of the output state. Since the classical moment problem does not
generalize to two or more modes, we turn in these cases to other familiar
sufficient but not necessary conditions for nonclassicality, namely the Mandel
parameter criterion and its extensions. We generalize the Mandel matrix from
one-mode states to the two-mode situation, leading to a natural classification
of states with varying levels of nonclassicality. For two--mode states we
present a single test that can, if successful, simultaneously show
nonclassicality as well as NPT entanglement. We also develop a test for NPT
entanglement after beamsplitter action on a nonclassical state, tracing
carefully the way in which it goes beyond the Mandel nonclassicality test. The
result of three--mode beamsplitter action after coupling to an ancilla in the
ground state is treated in the same spirit. The concept of genuine tripartite
entanglement, and scalar measures of nonclassicality at the Mandel level for
two-mode systems, are discussed. Numerous examples illustrating all these
concepts are presented.

  complexity analysis in Computer Science","25 pages",,,,"cs.CC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In 1994, S.G. Matthews introduced the notion of partial metric space in order
to obtain a suitable mathematical tool for program verification [Ann. New York
Acad. Sci. 728 (1994), 183-197]. He gave an application of this new structure
to parallel computing by means of a partial metric version of the celebrated
Banach fixed point theorem [Theoret. Comput. Sci. 151 (1995), 195-205]. Later
on, M.P. Schellekens introduced the theory of complexity (quasi-metric) spaces
as a part of the development of a topological foundation for the asymptotic
complexity analysis of programs and algorithms [Elec- tronic Notes in Theoret.
Comput. Sci. 1 (1995), 211-232]. The applicability of this theory to the
asymptotic complexity analysis of Divide and Conquer algorithms was also
illustrated by Schellekens. In particular, he gave a new proof, based on the
use of the aforenamed Banach fixed point theorem, of the well-known fact that
Mergesort al- gorithm has optimal asymptotic average running time of computing.
In this paper, motivated by the utility of partial metrics in Computer Science,
we discuss whether the Matthews fixed point theorem is a suitable tool to
analyze the asymptotic complexity of algorithms in the spirit of Schellekens.
Specifically, we show that a slight modification of the well-known Baire
partial metric on the set of all words over an alphabet constitutes an
appropriate tool to carry out the asymptotic complexity analysis of algorithms
via fixed point methods without the need for assuming the convergence condition
inherent to the defini- tion of the complexity space in the Shellekens
framework. Finally, in order to illustrate and to validate the developed theory
we apply our results to analyze the asymptotic complexity of Quicksort,
Mergesort and Largesort algorithms.

collapse of a zero metallicity halo with an effective equation of state (that
accounts for the trapping) and to explore the fate of a halo in each of the
three cases, specifically, the impact of thermodynamics on fragmentation of
halos.Our results show that in the case of Lyman alpha trapping, fragmentation
is halted and a massive object is formed at the center of a halo. The
temperature of the gas remains well above $10^{4}$ K and the halo is not able
to fragment to stellar masses. In the atomic cooling case, gas collapses into
one or two massive clumps in contrast to the Lyman alpha trapping case. For the
molecular hydrogen cooling case, gas cools efficiently and fragments.The
formation of massive primordial objects is thus strongly dependent on the
thermodynamics of the gas. A salient feature of our results is that for the
formation of massive objects, e.g. intermediate mass black holes, feedback
effects are not required to suppress $H_{2}$ cooling, as molecular hydrogen is
collisionally dissociated at temperatures higher than $10^{4}$ K as a
consequence of Lyman alpha trapping.

The presence of anisotropic stress, like the one generated by free-streaming

the Universe. We find that in the standard case of three neutrino families, 22%
of the intensity of the wave is absorbed, in fair agreement with previous
studies. We have also calculated the maximum possible amount of damping,
corresponding to the case of a flat Universe completely dominated by
ultrarelativistic collisionless particles. In this case 43% of the intensity of
the wave is absorbed. Finally, we have taken into account the effect of
collisions, using a simple form for the collision term parameterized by the
mean time between interactions, that allows to go smoothly from the case of a
tigthly-coupled fluid to that of a collisionless gas. The dependence of the
absorption on the neutrino energy density and on the effectiveness of the
interactions opens the interesting possibility of observing spectral features
related to particular events in the thermal history of the Universe, like
neutrino decoupling and electron-positron annihilation, both occurring at T~1

the spin-wave velocity $c$ of spin-1/2 antiferromagnets with $O(N)$ symmetry in
a Monte Carlo simulation. Specifically we suggest that $c$ can be determined by
$c = L/\beta$ when the squares of the spatial and temporal winding numbers are
tuned to be the same in the Monte Carlo calculations. Here $\beta$ and $L$ are
the inverse temperature and the box size used in the simulations when this
condition is met. We verify the validity of this idea by simulating the quantum
spin-1/2 XY model. The $c$ obtained by using the squares of winding numbers is
given by $c = 1.1348(5)Ja$ which is consistent with the known values of $c$ in
the literature. Unlike other conventional approaches, our new idea provides a
direct method to measure $c$. Further, by simultaneously fitting our Monte
Carlo data of susceptibilities $\chi_{11}$ and spin susceptibilities $\chi$ to
their theoretical predictions from magnon chiral perturbation theory, we find
$c$ is given by $c = 1.1347(2)Ja$ which agrees with the one we obtain by the
new method of using the squares of winding numbers. The low-energy constants
magnetization density ${\cal M}$ and spin stiffenss $\rho$ of quantum spin-1/2
XY model are determined as well and are given by ${\cal M} = 0.43561(1)/a^2$
and $\rho = 0.26974(5)J$, respectively. Thanks to the prediction power of
magnon chiral perturbation theory which puts a very restricted constraint among
the low-energy constants for the model considered here, the accuracy of ${\cal
M}$ we present in this study is much precise than previous Monte Carlo result.

Thus, to use a limited storage place efficiently in solving DCSP becomes a very
important problem, and it can help to reduce searching time as well. This paper
provides an efficient knowledge base management approach based on general usage
of hyper-resolution-rule in consistence algorithm. The approach minimizes the
increasing of the knowledge base by eliminate sufficient constraint and false
nogood. These eliminations do not change the completeness of the original

on the empirical nebular analyses assuming a uniform chemical composition. Our
results show that chemically homogeneous models yield small electron
temperature fluctuations and fail to reproduce the strengths of ORLs from C, N,
O and Ne ions. In contrast, bi-abundance models incorporating a small amount of
metal-rich inclusions ($\sim 1.3$ per cent of the total nebular mass) are able
to match all the observations within the measurement uncertainties. The
metal-rich clumps, cooled down to a very low temperature ($\sim 800$~K) by
ionic infrared fine-structure lines, dominate the emission of heavy element
ORLs, but contribute almost nil to the emission of most CELs. We find that the
abundances of C, N, O and Ne derived empirically from CELs, assuming a uniform
chemical composition, are about 30 per cent lower than the corresponding
average values of the whole nebula, including the contribution from the
H-deficient inclusions. Ironically, in the presence of H-deficient inclusions,
the traditional standard analysis of the optical helium recombination lines,
assuming a chemically homogeneous nebula, overestimates the helium abundance by
40 per cent.

one atom addressed by an external laser field. We show that the arrangement
would easily be realized in practice by trapping the atoms at the distance
equal to the quarter-wavelength of a standing-wave laser field and locating one
of the atoms at a node and the other at the successive antinode of the wave.
The undesirable dipole-dipole interaction between the atoms, that could be
large at this small distance, is adjusted to zero by a specific initial
preparation of the atoms or by a specific polarization of the atomic dipole
moments. Following this arrangement, we show that the dissipative relaxation
can create a stationary entanglement on demand by tuning the Rabi frequency of
the laser field to the difference between the atomic transition frequencies.
The laser field dresses the atom and we identify that the entangled state
occurs when the frequency of one of the Rabi sidebands of the driven atom tunes
to frequency of the undriven atom. It is also found that this system behaves as
a cascade open system where the fluorescence from the dressed atom drives the
other atom with no feedback.

in space. Deep insights on terrestrial life, extrasolar life, and the origin of
life in the universe, would be brought by consideration of both of the place
where life is able to live, the ""habitable"" zone, and the place where life is
able to originate, what we shall call the ""originable"" zone.

the parton distribution functions of the proton is presented. The study is
based on the HERA I combined data using a flexible parameterization form based
on Chebyshev polynomials with and without an additional regularization
constraint. The accuracy of the data allows to determine the gluon density in
the kinematic range of $0.0005 \le x \le 0.05 $ with a small parameterization
uncertainty. An additional regularization prior leads to a significantly
reduced uncertainty for $x \le 0.0005$.

In
order to build a framework for reasoning about such specifications, we make use
of a sequent calculus involving induction and co-induction. These proof
principles are based on a proof theoretic (rather than set-theoretic) notion of
definition. Definitions are akin to logic programs, where the left and right
rules for defined atoms allow one to view theories as ""closed"" or defining
fixed points. The use of definitions and free equality makes it possible to
reason intentionally about syntax. We add in a consistent way rules for pre and
post fixed points, thus allowing the user to reason inductively and
co-inductively about properties of computational system making full use of
higher-order abstract syntax. Consistency is guaranteed via cut-elimination,
where we give the first, to our knowledge, cut-elimination procedure in the
presence of general inductive and co-inductive definitions.

containing black holes with mass in the range from 10 thousand to 10 million
solar masses. Black holes in this mass range are not well constrained by
current electromagnetic observations, so LISA could significantly enhance our
understanding of the astrophysics of such systems. In this paper, we describe a
framework for combining LISA observations to make statements about massive
black hole populations. We summarise the constraints that LISA observations of
extreme-mass-ratio inspirals might be able to place on the mass function of
black holes in the LISA range. We also describe how LISA observations can be
used to choose between different models for the hierarchical growth of
structure in the early Universe. We consider four models that differ in their
prescription for the initial mass distribution of black hole seeds, and in the
efficiency of accretion onto the black holes. We show that with as little as 3
months of LISA data we can clearly distinguish between these models, even under
relatively pessimistic assumptions about the performance of the detector and
our knowledge of the gravitational waveforms.

non-relativistic field theory models that exhibit anisotropic scaling. The
prime example is the heat equation arising from a Lifshitz scalar field theory;
other examples include the Allen-Cahn equation that models the evolution of
phase boundaries. Then, I review recent results reported in arXiv:1002.0062
describing instantons of Horava-Lifshitz gravity as eternal solutions of
certain geometric flow equations on 3-manifolds. These instanton solutions are
in general chiral when the anisotropic scaling exponent is z=3. Some general
connections with the Onsager-Machlup theory of non-equilibrium processes are
also briefly discussed in this context. Thus, theories of Lifshitz type in d+1
dimensions can be used as off-shell toy models for dynamical vacuum selection
of relativistic field theories in d dimensions.

connected with spinor, this paper uses the combination of these spinors to
express the state of quantum field in a new style - the global state. Thus, the
state, state equation and action function of quantum fields are all expressed
in an integrated system. Based upon this, it seems that the origin of the
principle of least action, the intrinsic connection between classical mechanics
and quantum theory can be fully exposed.
