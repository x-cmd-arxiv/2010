and it is shown that the positions and widths of recombination minima and
Efimov resonances are identical for both states within the experimental errors
which indicates that the short-range physics is nuclear-spin independent. We
also find that the Efimov features are universally related across Feshbach
resonances. These results crucially depend on careful mapping between the
scattering length and the applied magnetic field which we achieve by
characterization of the two broad Feshbach resonances in the different states
by means of rf-spectroscopy of weakly bound molecules. By fitting the binding
energies numerically with a coupled channels calculation we precisely determine
the absolute positions of the Feshbach resonances and the values of the singlet
and triplet scattering lengths.

observed in Nd(0.8)Tb(0.2)Al(2). The ac susceptibility, the heat capacity and

between the contributions from nearly balanced weighted averages of moments of

study statistically the baryon fractions in early dark matter halos. We
critically examine how differences in the initial conditions affect the gas
fraction in the redshift range z = 11--21. We test three different linear power
spectra for the initial conditions: (1) A complete heating model, which is our
fiducial model; this model follows the evolution of overdensities correctly,
according to Naoz & Barkana (2005), in particular including the spatial
variation of the speed of sound of the gas due to Compton heating from the CMB.
(2) An equal-{\delta} model, which assumes that the initial baryon fluctuations
are equal to those of the dark matter, while conserving sigma8 of the total
matter. (3) A mean cs model, which assumes a uniform speed of sound of the gas.
The latter two models are often used in the literature. We calculate the baryon
fractions for a large sample of halos in our simulations. Our fiducial model
implies that before reionization and significant stellar heating took place,
the minimum mass needed for a minihalo to keep most of its baryons throughout
its formation was ~ 3 * 10^4 Msun. However, the alternative models yield a
wrong (higher by about 50%) minimum mass, since the system retains a memory of
the initial conditions. We also demonstrate this using the ""filtering mass""
from linear theory, which accurately describes the evolution of the baryon
fraction throughout the simulated redshift range.

of neutral hydrogen from the period before reionization would shed light on the
dawn of the first stars and galaxies. In this paper, we use large-scale
semi-numerical simulations to analyse the imprint on the 21 cm signal of
spatial fluctuations in the Lyman-alpha flux arising from the clustering of the
first galaxies. We show that an experiment such as the Square Kilometer Array
(SKA) can probe this signal at the onset of reionization, giving us important
information about the UV emission spectra of the first stars and characterizing
their host galaxies. SKA-pathfinders with ~ 10% of the full collecting area
should be capable of making a statistical detection of the 21 cm power spectrum
at redshifts z < 20 (corresponding to frequencies $\nu$ > 67 MHz). We then show
that the SKA should be able to measure the three dimensional power spectrum as
a function of the angle with the line of sight and discuss the use of the
redshift space distortions as a way to separate out the different components of
the 21 cm power spectrum. We demonstrate that, at least on large scales where
the Lyman-alpha fluctuations are linear, they can be used as a model
independent way to extract the power spectra due to these Lyman-alpha
fluctuations.

long-term, continuous star formation has been accompanied by a steady rate of
accretion of low-metallicity gas from the halo. We now argue that the recent
discovery of an enhanced deuterium (D) fraction in the Galaxy is consistent
with this picture. We consider two processes: the destruction of D in the
interior of stars (astration) and the supply of nearly primordial D associated
with the gas infall. Conventional Galactic chemical evolution models predict a
monotonic decrease in D/H with time with a present-day D/H abundance which is
much lower than the local value recently revealed. This predicted feature is
the result of high levels of deuterium astration involved in the formation of
the local metal-enhanced disk. Here we propose a new channel to explain the
observed enhancement in D/H. Our model, which invokes ongoing gaseous infall
and a star formation rate that declines over the past several Gyr, predicts
that the D astration is suppressed over the same time interval.

radiation, cosmic microwave background radiation, radio source counts, quasar
variability and the Butcher--Oemler effect. An analysis of the best raw data

evolution that cancels the effects of expansion. An alternate cosmology,
curvature cosmology, is in full agreement with the raw data. This tired-light
cosmology predicts a well defined static and stable universe and is fully
described. It not only predicts accurate values for the Hubble constant and the
temperature of cosmic microwave background radiation but shows excellent

nonequilibrium steady states (NESS), we take the one which is guided by
operational thermodynamics and the Clausius relation. In our previous study, we
derived the extended Clausius relation for NESS, where the heat in the original
relation is replaced by its ""renormalized"" counterpart called the excess heat,
and the Gibbs-Shannon expression for the entropy by a new symmetrized
Gibbs-Shannon-like expression. Here we concentrate on Markov processes
describing heat conducting systems, and develop a new method for deriving
thermodynamic relations. We first present a new simpler derivation of the
extended Clausius relation, and clarify its close relation with the linear
response theory. We then derive a new improved extended Clausius relation with
a ""nonlinear nonequilibrium"" contribution which is written as a correlation
between work and heat. We argue that the ""nonlinear nonequilibrium""
contribution is unavoidable, and is determined uniquely once we accept the
(very natural) definition of the excess heat. Moreover it turns out that to
operationally determine the difference in the nonequilibrium entropy to the
second order in the temperature difference, one may only use the previous
Clausius relation without a nonlinear term or must use the new relation,
depending on the operation (i.e., the path in the parameter space). This

their associated timestamps. Transitional patterns are the patterns which
specify the dynamic behavior of frequent patterns in a transaction database. To
discover transitional patterns and their significant milestones, first we have
to extract all frequent patterns and their supports using any frequent pattern
generation algorithm. These frequent patterns are used in the generation of
transitional patterns. The existing algorithm (TP-Mine) generates frequent
patterns, some of which cannot be used in generation of transitional patterns.
In this paper, we propose a modification to the existing algorithm, which
prunes the candidate items to be used in the generation of frequent patterns.
This method drastically reduces the number of frequent patterns which are used
in discovering transitional patterns. Extensive simulation test is done to
evaluate the proposed method.

equilibrium, real economic systems appear to be always out of equilibrium.
Indeed, they share many of the dynamical features of other complex systems,
e.g., ecological food-webs. We focus on the relation between increasing
complexity of the economic network and its stability with respect to small
perturbations in the dynamical variables associated with the constituent nodes.
Inherent delays and multiple time-scales suggest that economic systems will be
more likely to exhibit instabilities as their complexity is increased even
though the speed at which transactions are conducted has increased many-fold
through technological developments. Analogous to the birth of nonlinear
dynamics from Poincare's work on the question of whether the solar system is
stable, we suggest that similar theoretical developments may arise from efforts
by econophysicists to understand the mechanisms by which instabilities arise in
the economy.

conclude that, within the framework of a simple atmospheric model, the IMaX

by initial envelope structures that differ only by their metal content. At
selected phases along the evolutionary path, the hydrodynamic terms were
switched off, allowing the models to relax for fixed radial structure and

ionisation. The analyses of the line spectra emitted from both the dynamical

hydrodynamics as a function of metallicity and evolution. We also recomputed
selected sequences already used in previous publications, but now with
different metal abundances. These sequences were used to study the expansion
properties of planetary nebulae close to the bright cut-off of the planetary
nebula luminosity function. Our simulations show that the metal content
strongly influences the expansion of planetary nebulae: the lower the metal
content, the weaker the pressure of the stellar wind bubble, but the faster the
expansion of the outer shell because of the higher electron temperature. This
is in variance with the predictions of the interacting-stellar-winds model (or
its variants) according to which only the central-star wind is thought to be
responsible for driving the expansion of a planetary nebula. Metal-poor objects
around slowly evolving central stars become very dilute and are prone to depart
from thermal equilibrium because then adiabatic expansion contributes to gas
cooling. ...abridged abstract.

lead to an important reduction of such spurious reflections. In this paper, a
simple absorbing layer method is proposed: it is based on a Rayleigh/Caughey
damping formulation which is often already available in existing Finite Element
softwares. The principle of the Caughey Absorbing Layer Method is first
presented (including a rheological interpretation). The efficiency of the
method is then shown through 1D Finite Element simulations considering
homogeneous and heterogeneous damping in the absorbing layer. 2D models are
considered afterwards to assess the efficiency of the absorbing layer method
for various wave types and incidences. A comparison with the PML method is
first performed for pure P-waves and the method is shown to be reliable in a
more complex 2D case involving various wave types and incidences. It may thus
be used for various types of problems involving elastic waves (e.g. machine

product of stellar evolution, their internal composition and structure is
rather poorly constrained by measurements.
  It is the purpose of this paper to put some constrains on the mass and moment
of inertia of neutron stars based on the interpretation of kHz quasi-periodic
oscillations observed in low mass X-ray binaries.
  We use observations of high-frequency quasi-periodic observations (HF-QPOs)
in low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) to look for the average mass and moment of
inertia of neutron stars. This is done by applying our parametric resonance
model to discriminate between slow and fast rotators.
  We fit our model to data from ten LMXBs for which HF-QPOs have been seen and
the spin of the enclosed accreting neutron star is known. For a simplified
analysis we assume that all neutron stars possess the same properties (same
mass $M_*$ and same moment of inertia $I_*$). We find an average mass $M_*
\approx 2.0-2.2\, M_{\odot}$. The corresponding average moment of inertia is
then $I_* \approx 1-3 \times 10^{38}\;{\rm kg\,m^2} \approx 0.5-1.5 \,
(10\;\textrm{ km})^2 \, M_\odot$ which equals to dimensionless spin parameter
$\tilde{a} \approx 0.05-0.15$ for slow rotators (neutron stars with a spin

are compared with simulations. We demonstrate good agreement with theory. A
peak attenuation of 295 was achieved, and contrasts of 10^-5 and 10^-6 were

maintain these contrasts with a central obscuration ratio of the telescope in

a wide wavelength bandpass (BW = 24%). In addition, we report improvement to
the accuracy of the control of the local transmission of the manufactured
microdot apodizer to that of the previous prototype. The local profile error is

strongly (by a factor of several) from those in photoequilibrium due to
overionization of the ionic states in the nonequilibrium case. The difference

notable at $T\simlt 10^6$ K. In this temperature range, the mismatch of the

them persistent or transient, are characterized by the presence of a strong
thermal Comptonization bump, thought to originate in the transition layer (TL)
between the accretion disk and the NS surface. The observable quantities which
characterize this component dominating the emission below 30 keV, are the
spectral index alpha and the rollover energy, both related to the electron
temperature and optical depth of the plasma. Starting from observational
results on a sample of NS LMXBs in different spectral states, we formulate the
problem of X-ray spectral formation in the TL of these sources. We predict a
stability of the thermal Comptonization spectral index in different spectral
states if the energy release in the TL is much higher than the intercepted flux
coming from the accretion disk. We use an equation for the energy balance and
the radiative transfer diffusion equation for a slab geometry in the TL, to
derive a formula for the thermal Comptonization index alpha. We show that in
this approximation the TL electron temperature kTe and optical depth tau_0 can
be written as a function of the energy flux from the disk intercepted by the
corona (TL) and that in the corona itself Qdisk/Qcor, in turn leading to a
relation alpha=f(Qdisk/Qcor), with alpha ~ 1 when Qdisk/Qcor <<1. We show that
the observed spectral index alpha for the sample of sources here considered
lies in a belt around 1 +/- 0.2 a part for the case of GX 354--0. Comparing our
theoretical predictions with observations, we claim that this result, which is
consistent with the condition Qdisk/Qcor <<1, can give us constraints on the
accretion geometry of these systems, an issue that seems difficult to be solved
using only the spectral analysis method.

remarkable characteristics. It consists of a knotty ring expanding at a speed
of 28 km/s, and a fast collimated outflow in the form of faint lobes and caps
along the direction perpendicular to the ring. The expansion speed of the polar
caps is 100 km/s, and their kinematical age is twice as large as the age of the
ring. Time-resolved photometry of the central star of IPHASXJ194359.5+170901
reveals a sinusoidal modulation with a period of 1.16 days. This is interpreted
as evidence for binarity of the central star, the brightness variations being
related to the orbital motion of an irradiated companion. This is supported by
the spectrum of the central star in the visible range, which appears to be
dominated by emission from the irradiated zone, consisting of a warm (6000-7000
K) continuum, narrow C III, C IV, and N III emission lines, and broader lines
from a flat H I Balmer sequence in emission. IPHASXJ194359.5+170901 helps to
clarify the role of (close) binaries in the formation and shaping of planetary
nebulae. The output of the common-envelope evolution of the system is a
strongly flattened circumstellar mass deposition, a feature that seems to be
distinctive of this kind of binary system. Also, IPHASXJ194359.5+170901 is
among the first post-CE PNe for which the existence of a high-velocity polar
outflow has been demonstrated. Its kinematical age might indicate that the
polar outflow is formed before the common-envelope phase. This points to mass
transfer onto the secondary as the origin, but alternative explanations are
also considered.

Efficiently sampling such a wide range of frequencies provides a considerable
thermostatting challenge. Here we introduce a simple stochastic path integral
Langevin equation (PILE) thermostat which exploits an analytic knowledge of the
free path integral normal mode frequencies. We also apply a recently-developed
colored-noise thermostat based on a generalized Langevin equation (GLE), which
automatically achieves a similar, frequency-optimized sampling. The sampling
efficiencies of these thermostats are compared with that of the more
conventional Nos\'e-Hoover chain (NHC) thermostat for a number of physically
relevant properties of the liquid water and hydrogen-in-palladium systems. In
nearly every case, the new PILE thermostat is found to perform just as well as
the NHC thermostat while allowing for a computationally more efficient
implementation. The GLE thermostat also proves to be very robust delivering a
near-optimum sampling efficiency in all of the cases considered. We suspect
that these simple stochastic thermostats will therefore find useful application

dust temperatures of local galaxies at z<0.1 using AKARI and IRAS data in the

that of AKARI-selected local galaxies with similar luminosities; and the
dispersion in T_dust for high-z galaxies increases with L_IR due to the
existence of cold galaxies that are not seen among local galaxies. We show that
this large dispersion of the L_IR-T_dust relation can bridge the gap between
local star-forming galaxies and high-z submillimeter galaxies (SMGs). We also
find that three SMGs with very low T_dust (<20 K) covered in this study have

spontaneously form ""graphene-like"" nanoflakes. We propose that these

the dimer configuration, we analyze the different contributions to its binding
energy. A significant reinforcement of the intermolecular hydrogen-bond
(H-bond), also supported by the observed frequency shifts of the vibration
modes, is attributed to the polarization of the donor molecule when bonded to
the Ru atoms in the substrate. This result is further confirmed by our

clearly show that the observed effect does not depend critically on fine
structural details and/or the presence of co-adsorbates. Interestingly, the
cooperative reinforcement of the H-bond is suppressed when the acceptor

Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) with dipolar interactions loaded into an optical
lattice with a staggered flux. Apart from uniform superfluid, checkerboard
supersolid and striped supersolid phases, we identify several supersolid phases
with staggered vortices, which can be seen as combinations of supersolid phases
found in earlier work on dipolar BECs and a staggered-vortex phase found for
bosons in optical lattices with staggered flux. By allowing for different
phases and densities on each of the four sites of the elementary plaquette,
more complex phase patterns are found.

approximation and show explicitly that they can be used to solve
non-equilibrium dynamics of bosonic atoms in one-dimensional traps. We consider
systems both with and without an optical lattice, and address different
approximations in the stochastic synthesization of quantum statistical
correlations of the initial atomic field. We also present a numerically
efficient projection method for analyzing correlation functions of the
simulation results, and demonstrate physical examples of non-equilibrium
quantum dynamics of solitons and atom number squeezing in optical lattices.

problem of net theory. The general problem is known to be decidable by
algorithms exclusively based on the classical
Kosaraju-Lambert-Mayr-Sacerdote-Tenney decomposition. This decomposition is
used in this paper to prove that the Parikh images of languages recognized by
VASs are semi-pseudo-linear; a class that extends the semi-linear sets, a.k.a.
the sets definable in Presburger arithmetic. We provide an application of this
result; we prove that a final configuration is not reachable from an initial
one if and only if there exists a semi-linear inductive invariant that contains
the initial configuration but not the final one. Since we can decide if a
Presburger formula denotes an inductive invariant, we deduce that there exist
checkable certificates of non-reachability. In particular, there exists a
simple algorithm for deciding the general VAS reachability problem based on two
semi-algorithms. A first one that tries to prove the reachability by
enumerating finite sequences of actions and a second one that tries to prove
the non-reachability by enumerating Presburger formulas.

non coupled spins which differ in the value of their chemical offsets are
controlled by the same magnetic fields. Using an appropriate rotating frame, we
restrict the study to the case of opposite shifts. We then show that the
optimal solution of the inversion problem in a rotating frame is composed of a
pulse sequence of maximum intensity and is similar to the optimal solution for
inverting only one spin by using a non-resonant control field in the laboratory
frame. An example is implemented experimentally using techniques of Nuclear
Magnetic Resonance.

diagnosis of melanoma and other pigmented skin lesions. Due to the difficulty
and subjectivity of human interpretation, automated analysis of dermoscopy
images has become an important research area. Border detection is often the
first step in this analysis. Methods: In this article, we present an
approximate lesion localization method that serves as a preprocessing step for
detecting borders in dermoscopy images. In this method, first the black frame
around the image is removed using an iterative algorithm. The approximate
location of the lesion is then determined using an ensemble of thresholding
algorithms. Results: The method is tested on a set of 428 dermoscopy images.
The localization error is quantified by a metric that uses dermatologist
determined borders as the ground truth. Conclusion: The results demonstrate
that the method presented here achieves both fast and accurate localization of
lesions in dermoscopy images.
