cookies) random walks toward an excited Brownian motion. This last process is a
continuous semi-martingale whose drift is a function, say $\phi$, of its local
time. It was introduced by Norris, Rogers and Williams as a simplified version
of Brownian polymers, and then recently further studied by the authors. To get
our results we need to renormalize together the sequence of cookies, the time
and the space in a convenient way. The proof follows a general approach already
taken by T\'oth and his coauthors in multiple occasions, which goes through
Ray-Knight type results. Namely we first prove, when $\phi$ is bounded and
Lipschitz, that the convergence holds at the level of the local time processes.
This is done via a careful study of the transition kernel of an auxiliary
Markov chain which describes the local time at a given level. Then we prove a
tightness result and deduce the convergence at the level of the full processes.

(MEP) and energy barriers between local minima on a multidimensional potential
energy surface (PES). Such paths play a central role in the understanding of
transition pathways between metastable states. Our method relies on the
original formulation of the string method [Phys. Rev. B ${\bf 66}$, 052301
(2002)], i.e. to evolve a smooth curve along a direction normal to the curve.
The algorithm works by performing minimization steps on hyperplanes normal to
the curve. Therefore the problem of finding MEP on the PES is remodeled as a
set of constrained minimization problems. This provides the flexibility of
using minimization algorithms faster than the steepest descent method used in
the simplified string method [J. Chem. Phys., ${\bf 126}$(16),164103 (2007)].
At the same time, it provides a more direct analog of the finite temperature
string method. The applicability of the algorithm is demonstrated using various
examples.

consider the problem in the time domain and subject to constraints on the
amplitude of the input signal. This optimization problem is nonconvex. The main
result of the paper is a convex relaxation that gives an upper bound accurate
to within $2/\pi$ of the true maximum. A randomized algorithm is presented for
finding a feasible solution which, in a certain sense is expected to be at
least $2/\pi$ as informative as the globally optimal input signal. In the case
of a single constraint on input power, the proposed approach recovers the true
global optimum exactly. Extensions to situations with both power and amplitude
constraints on both inputs and outputs are given. A simple simulation example
illustrates the technique.

model-dependent. On one hand, models involving elaborate radiative transfer
solvers are too time consuming in general to perform an automatic fitting
procedure and derive astrophysical quantities and their related errors. On the
other hand, using simple geometrical models does not give sufficient insights
into the physics of the object. We propose to stand in between these two
extreme approaches by using a physical but still simple parameterised model for
the object under consideration. Based on this philosophy, we developed a
numerical tool optimised for mid-infrared (mid-IR) interferometry, the fast
ray-tracing algorithm for circumstellar structures (FRACS) which can be used as
a stand-alone model, or as an aid for a more advanced physical description or
even for elaborating observation strategies. FRACS is based on the ray-tracing
technique without scattering, but supplemented with the use of quadtree meshes
and the full symmetries of the axisymmetrical problem to significantly decrease
the necessary computing time to obtain e.g. monochromatic images and
visibilities. We applied FRACS in a theoretical study of the dusty
circumstellar environments (CSEs) of B[e] supergiants (sgB[e]) in order to
determine which information (physical parameters) can be retrieved from present
mid-IR interferometry (flux and visibility). From a set of selected dusty CSE
models typical of sgB[e] stars we show that together with the geometrical
parameters (position angle, inclination, inner radius), the temperature
structure (inner dust temperature and gradient) can be well constrained by the
mid-IR data alone. Our results also indicate that the determination of the
parameters characterising the CSE density structure is more challenging but, in
some cases, upper limits as well as correlations on the parameters
characterising the mass loss can be obtained. Good constraints for the sgB[e]
central continuum emission (central star and inner gas emissions) can be
obtained whenever its contribution to the total mid-IR flux is only as high as
a few percents. Ray-tracing parameterised models such as FRACS are thus well
adapted to prepare and/or interpret long wavelengths (from mid-IR to radio)

OC-SSGs are 2-player turn-based stochastic games played on the transition graph

where the goal of one player is to maximize the probability of reaching counter
value 0, while the other player wishes to avoid this. Partly motivated by the
goal of understanding termination objectives, we also study certain ""limit"" and
""long run average"" reward objectives that are closely related to some
well-studied objectives for stochastic games with rewards. Examples of problems
we address include: does player 1 have a strategy to ensure that the counter
eventually hits 0, i.e., terminates, almost surely, regardless of what player 2
does? Or that the liminf (or limsup) counter value equals infinity with a
desired probability? Or that the long run average reward is >0 with desired
probability? We show that the qualitative termination problem for OC-SSGs is in
NP intersection coNP, and is in P-time for 1-player OC-SSGs, or equivalently
for one-counter Markov Decision Processes (OC-MDPs). Moreover, we show that
quantitative limit problems for OC-SSGs are in NP intersection coNP, and are in
P-time for 1-player OC-MDPs. Both qualitative limit problems and qualitative
termination problems for OC-SSGs are already at least as hard as Condon's

penumbral filaments. Our analysis is based on measurements of the Fe I 709.0 nm
line taken with the Littrow spectrograph of the Swedish 1 m Solar Telescope
under excellent seeing conditions. We compute line bisectors at different
intensity levels and derive Doppler velocities from them. The velocities are
calibrated using a nearby telluric line, with systematic errors smaller than
150 m/s. Deep in the photosphere, as sampled by the bisectors at the 80%-88%
intensity levels, we always observe blueshifts or zero velocities. The maximum
blueshifts reach 1.2 km/s and tend to be cospatial with bright penumbral
filaments. In the line core we detect blueshifts for the most part, with small
velocities not exceeding 300 m/s. Redshifts also occur, but at the level of
100-150 m/s, and only occasionally. The fact that they are visible in high
layers casts doubts on their convective origin. Overall, we do not find
indications of downflows that could be associated with overturning convection
at our detection limit of 150 m/s. Either no downflows exist, or we have been
unable to observe them because they occur beneath tau=1 or the spatial
resolution/height resolution of the measurements is still insufficient.

exhibited by developing a theory of the generating function $H(z)$ of Hurwitz
polyzeta functions to parallel that of the polylogarithms. By emulating the
role of the KZ equation as a connection on a suitable bundle, a difference
equation version of the notion of connection is developed for which $H(z)$ is a
flat section. Solving a family of difference equations satisfied by the Hurwitz
polyzetas leads to the normalized multiple Bernoulli polynomials (NMBPs) as the
counterpart to the Hurwitz polyzeta functions, at tuples of negative integers.
A generating function for these polynomials satisfies a similar difference
equation to that of $H(z)$, but in contrast to the fact that said polynomials
have rational coefficients, the algebraic independence of the Hurwitz polyzeta
functions is proven. The values of the NMBPs at $z=1$ provide a regularization
of the multiple zeta values at tuples of negative integers, which is shown to
agree with the regularization given in work of S. Akiyama and collaborators.
Various elementary properties of these values are proven.

combining smaller circuit components. Connections between components are
achieved by transcription factors acting on promoters. If the individual
components behave as true modules and certain module interface conditions are
satisfied, the function of the composite circuits can in principle be
predicted. In this paper, we investigate one of the interface conditions:
fan-out. We quantify the fan-out, a concept widely used in electric
engineering, to indicate the maximum number of the downstream inputs that an
upstream output transcription factor can regulate. We show that the fan-out is
closely related to retroactivity studied by Del Vecchio, et al. We propose an
efficient operational method for measuring the fan-out that can be applied to
various types of module interfaces. We also show that the fan-out can be
enhanced by self-inhibitory regulation on the output. We discuss the potential
role of the inhibitory regulations found in gene regulatory networks and
protein signal pathways. The proposed estimation method for fanout not only
provides an experimentally efficient way for quantifying the level of
modularity in gene regulatory circuits but also helps characterize and design
module interfaces, enabling the modular construction of gene circuits.

from X-ray line profiles are not sensitive to density-squared clumping effects,
and indicate mass-loss rate reductions of factors of 3 to 6 over traditional
diagnostics that suffer from density-squared effects. Broad-band X-ray spectral
energy distributions also provide mass-loss rate information via soft X-ray
absorption signatures. In some cases, the degree of wind absorption is so high

cosmic far-infrared background. Deep Herschel-SPIRE images designed to detect
and characterize the galaxies that comprise this background are highly
confused, such that the bulk lies below the classical confusion limit. We
analyze three fields from the HerMES programme in all three SPIRE bands (250,
350, and 500 microns); parameterized galaxy number count models are derived to
a depth of ~2 mJy/beam, approximately 4 times the depth of previous analyses at
these wavelengths, using a P(D) (probability of deflection) approach for
comparison to theoretical number count models. Our fits account for 64, 60, and
43 per cent of the far-infrared background in the three bands. The number
counts are consistent with those based on individually detected SPIRE sources,
but generally inconsistent with most galaxy number counts models, which
generically overpredict the number of bright galaxies and are not as steep as
the P(D)-derived number counts. Clear evidence is found for a break in the
slope of the differential number counts at low flux densities. Systematic
effects in the P(D) analysis are explored. We find that the effects of
clustering have a small impact on the data, and the largest identified
systematic error arises from uncertainties in the SPIRE beam.

that evolution of our configuration in the holographic direction, representing

including the M81/M82 and NGC 2403 galaxy groups, searching for observational
evidence of an HI component associated with dark matter halos within the ""M81

an 8.7 degree x 21.3 degree (480 kpc x 1.2 Mpc) region centered between the
M81/M82 and NGC 2403 galaxy groups. Our observations cover a wide velocity
range, from -890 to 1320 km/s, which spans much of the range predicted by
cosmological N-body simulations for dark matter minihalo velocities. Our search
is not complete in the velocity range -210 to 85 km/s, containing Galactic
emission and the HVC Complex A. For an HI cloud at the distance of M81, with a
size < 10 kpc, our average 5-sigma mass detection limit is 3.2 x 10^6 M_Sun,
for a linewidth of 20 km/s. We compare our observations to two large
cosmological N-body simulations and find that the simulation predicts a
significantly greater number of detectable minihalos than are found in our

observed HI clouds. These results place strong constraints on the HI gas that
can be associated with dark-matter halos. Our observations indicate that the

Gaussianizing also increases the Fisher information in the power spectrum in

field are studied. These black holes are solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell
theory with a negative cosmological constant and a conformally coupled real
self-interacting scalar field. Comparing, in the grand canonical ensemble, the
free energies of the hairy and undressed black holes two different phase
transitions are found. The first of them is one of second-order type and it
occurs at a temperature defined by the value of the cosmological constant.
Below this temperature an undressed black hole spontaneously acquires a scalar
hair. The other phase transition is one of first-order type. The corresponding
critical temperature, which is bounded from above by the one of the previous
case, strongly depends on the coupling constant of the quartic self-interaction
potential, and this transition only appears when the coupling constant is less
than a certain value. In this case, below the critical temperature the
undressed black is thermodynamically favored. However, when the temperature
exceeds the critical value a hairy black hole is likely to be occur.

complex behavior as a function of mutual orientations and separation of the
domain walls, thus affecting the domain wall dynamics. Then we consider how the
theory should be modified in the case of a magnetized quantum ring. In this
case the situation is more complicated because the vortex and onion
magnetization states in the ring are not truly ferromagnetic.

regression models, where the overall number of regressors $p$ is large,
possibly much larger than $n$, but only $s$ regressors are significant. The
method is a modification of the lasso, called the square-root lasso. The method
is pivotal in that it neither relies on the knowledge of the standard deviation
$\sigma$ or nor does it need to pre-estimate $\sigma$. Moreover, the method
does not rely on normality or sub-Gaussianity of noise. It achieves near-oracle
performance, attaining the convergence rate $\sigma \{(s/n)\log p\}^{1/2}$ in
the prediction norm, and thus matching the performance of the lasso with known
$\sigma$. These performance results are valid for both Gaussian and
non-Gaussian errors, under some mild moment restrictions. We formulate the
square-root lasso as a solution to a convex conic programming problem, which
allows us to implement the estimator using efficient algorithmic methods, such
as interior-point and first-order methods.

scattering length $a_s$ exhibit a variety of intriguing properties. Among these
are the scale invariance of two-component Fermi gases with equal masses, and
the favorable scaling of Efimov features for two-component Bose gases and
Bose-Fermi mixtures with unequal masses. This paper builds on our earlier work
[D. Blume and K. M. Daily, arXiv:1006.5002] and presents a detailed discussion
of our studies of small unequal-mass two-component systems with infinite $a_s$
in the regime where three-body Efimov physics is absent. We report on
non-universal few-body resonances. Just like with two-body systems on
resonance, few-body systems have a zero-energy bound state in free space and a
diverging generalized scattering length. Our calculations are performed within
a non-perturbative microscopic framework and investigate the energetics and
structural properties of small unequal-mass two-component systems as functions
of the mass ratio $\kappa$, and the numbers $N_{1}$ and $N_2$ of heavy and
light atoms. For purely attractive Gaussian two-body interactions, we find that
the $(N_1,N_2)=(2,1)$ and $(3,1)$ systems exhibit three-body and four-body
resonances at mass ratios $\kappa = 12.314(2)$ and 10.4(2), respectively. The
three- and four-particle systems on resonance are found to be large. This
suggests that the corresponding wave function has relatively small overlap with
deeply-bound dimers, trimers or larger clusters and that the three- and
four-body systems on resonance have a comparatively long lifetime. Thus, it
seems feasible that the features discussed in this paper can be probed
experimentally with present-day technology.

VandenBerg & Clem (2003, AJ, 126, 778) have also been considered, mainly to
resolve some outstanding questions concerning them. Remarkably, when the
subdwarfs in the CRMBA data set that have sigma_pi/pi < 0.15 are superimposed
on a set of 12 Gyr isochrones spanning a wide range in [Fe/H], the inferred
metallicities and effective temperatures agree, in the mean, with those given
by CRMBA to within +/- 0.05 dex and +/- 10 K, respectively. Thus the hot Teff
scale derived by CRMBA is nearly identical with that predicted by stellar
models and consequently, there is excellent consistency between theory and
observations on the H-R diagram and the different color-magnitude diagrams
considered in this investigation. To obtain similar consistency, the colors
obtained from the MARCS and VandenBerg & Clem B-V vs. Teff relations for
metal-poor dwarf stars should be adjusted to the red by 0.02-0.03 mag. In
general, isochrones that employ the CRMBA transformations provide reasonably
good fits to our BV(RI)_C photometry for main-sequence stars in the globular
clusters 47 Tuc, M3, M5, M92 and NGC 1851 - but not the cluster giants (when
adopting the synthetic MARCS colors). We speculate that differences between the
actual heavy-element mixtures and those assumed in the theoretical models may
be the primary cause of this difficulty.

thirteen 250\mu m-luminous galaxies in the CDF-S, seven of which have confirmed
redshifts which average to <z > = 2.0 \pm 0.4. Another two sources of the 13
have tentative z > 1 identifications. Eight of the nine redshifts were
identified with H{\alpha} detection in H- and K-bands, three of which are
confirmed redshifts from previous spectroscopic surveys. We use their near-IR
spectra to measure H{\alpha} line widths and luminosities, which average to 415
\pm 20 km/s and 3 \times 10^35 W (implying SFR(H{\alpha})~200 M_\odot /yr),
both similar to the H{\alpha} properties of SMGs. Just like SMGs, 250 \mu
m-luminous galaxies have large H{\alpha} to far-infrared (FIR) extinction
factors such that the H{\alpha} SFRs underestimate the FIR SFRs by ~8-80 times.
Far-infrared photometric points from observed 24\mu m through 870\mu m are used
to constrain the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) even though uncertainty
caused by FIR confusion in the BLAST bands is significant. The population has a
mean dust temperature of Td = 52 \pm 6 K, emissivity {\beta} = 1.73 \pm 0.13,
and FIR luminosity LFIR = 3 \times 10^13 L_\odot. Although selection at 250\mu
m allows for the detection of much hotter dust dominated HyLIRGs than SMG
selection (at 850\mu m), we do not find any >60 K 'hot-dust' HyLIRGs. We have
shown that near-infrared spectroscopy combined with good photometric redshifts
is an efficient way to spectroscopically identify and characterise these rare,
extreme systems, hundreds of which are being discovered by the newest
generation of IR observatories including the Herschel Space Observatory.

back-action on quantum systems by their quantum environment(s). Here we
consider a system of two independently evolving qubits, each locally
interacting with a classical random external field. The environments of the
qubits are also independent, and there is no back-action on the qubits.
Nevertheless, entanglement, quantum discord and classical correlations between
the two qubits may revive in this model. We explain the revivals in terms of
correlations in a classical-quantum state of the environments and the qubits.
Although classical states cannot store entanglement on their own, they can play
a role in storing and reviving entanglement. It is important to know how the
absence of back-action, or modelling an environment as classical, affects the
kind of system time evolutions one is able to describe. We find a class of
global time evolutions where back-action is absent and for which there is no
loss of generality in modelling the environment as classical. Finally, we show
that the revivals can be connected with the increase of a parameter used to
quantify non-Markovianity of the single-qubit dynamics.

with rotation curves dominated by a central object, but with substantial
contributions from magnetic pressure and tension. The treatment is general, but
the application is to the circumstellar disks that arise during the
gravitational collapse phase of star formation. We find the dispersion relation
for spiral density waves in these generalized disks and derive the stability
criterion for axisymmetric $(m=0)$ disturbances (the analog of the Toomre
parameter $Q_T$) for any radial distribution of the mass-to-flux ratio
$\lambda$. The magnetic effects work in two opposing directions: on one hand,
magnetic tension and pressure stabilize the disk against gravitational collapse
and fragmentation; on the other hand, they also lower the rotation rate making
the disk more unstable. For disks around young stars the first effect generally
dominates, so that magnetic fields allow disks to be stable for higher surface
densities and larger total masses. These results indicate that magnetic fields
act to suppress the formation of giant planets through gravitational
instability. Finally, even if gravitational instability can form a secondary
body, it must lose an enormous amount of magnetic flux in order to become a
planet; this latter requirement represents an additional constraint for planet
formation via gravitational instability and places a lower limit on the
electrical resistivity.

classification, log Lbol/Lsun = -5.62+/-0.03, Teff = 650+/-25 K, and a mass at

K-band associated with youth (low surface gravity) and supersolar metallicity,

confirm a low surface gravity and supersolar metallicity, while the temperature
differs depending on the presence (635 [+25,-35] K) or absence (760 [+70,-45]
K) of cloud extinction. ULAS J1335+1130 and SDSS J1416+1348B have similar

three cases, cloudy models provide better fits to the spectral data,
significantly so for Ross 458C. These results indicate that clouds are an
important opacity source in the spectra of young cold T dwarfs, and should be
considered when characterizing the spectra of planetary-mass objects in young
clusters and directly-imaged exoplanets. The characteristics of Ross 458C
suggest it could itself be regarded as a planet, albeit one whose cosmogony

perpendicular magnetic field, to minimize their energy, they capture an even
number of flux quanta and create new particles called composite fermions (CFs).
These complex electron-flux-bound states offer an elegant explanation for the
fractional quantum Hall effect. Furthermore, thanks to the flux attachment, the
effective field vanishes at a half-filled Landau level and CFs exhibit
Fermi-liquid-like properties, similar to their zero-field electron
counterparts. However, being solely influenced by interactions, CFs should
possess no memory whatever of the electron parameters. Here we address a
fundamental question: Does an anisotropy of the electron effective mass and
Fermi surface (FS) survive composite fermionization? We measure the resistance
of CFs in AlAs quantum wells where electrons occupy an elliptical FS with large
eccentricity and anisotropic effective mass. Similar to their electron

which corresponds to maximum a posteriori (MAP) parameter estimation with an
entropic prior. The lack of conjugacy between the entropic prior and the
multinomial distribution complicates this approach. In this report I propose a
simple iterative algorithm for MAP estimation of multinomial distributions with
sparsity-inducing entropic priors.

the output of insignificant coefficients, and 2) using variable-length group
test coding with context weights to adjust the coding order and cost as few

104), we study the diffuse X-ray emission in and around its massive stellar

the K-band star light and most likely arises from unresolved stellar sources.
At lower energies, however, the unresolved emission reaches a galactocentric
radius of at least 23 kpc, significantly beyond the extent of the starlight,
clearly indicating the presence of diffuse hot gas. We isolate the emission of
the gas by properly accounting for the emission from unresolved stellar
sources, predominantly cataclysmic variables and coronally active binaries,
whose quasi-universal X-ray emissivity is recently established. We find a gas
temperature of ~0.6 keV with little variation across the field of view, except
for a lower temperature of ~0.3 keV along the stellar disk. We measure a total
intrinsic 0.3-2 keV luminosity of ~2e39 erg/s, which is comparable to the
prediction by the latest galaxy formation models for disk galaxies as massive
as Sombrero. However, such numerical models do not fully account for internal
feedback processes, such as nuclear feedback and stellar feedback, against
accretion from the intergalactic medium. On the other hand, we find no evidence
for either the nucleus or the very modest star-forming activities in the disk
to be a dominant heating source for the diffuse gas. We also show that neither
the expected energy released by Type Ia supernovae nor the expected mass
returned by evolved stars is recovered by observations. We argue that in
Sombrero a galactic-scale subsonic outflow of hot gas continuously removes much
of the ""missing"" energy and mass input from the bulge region. The observed

data, we find that its transit timings do not match a linear ephemeris; the
best fit \chi^2 values is 32.2 with 9 degrees of freedom which corresponds to a
confidence level of 99.982 % or 3.7 \sigma. This result indicates that excess
variations of transit timings has been observed, due either to unknown
systematic effects or possibly to real TTVs. The TTV amplitude is as large as
50 s, and if this is real, it cannot be explained by other effects than that
due to an additional body or bodies. From the RV data, we put an upper limit on
the RV amplitude caused by the possible secondary body (planet) as 21 m s^{-1},
which corresponds to its mass of 22-70 M_{Earth} over the orbital period ratio
of the two planets from 0.2 to 5.0. From the TTVs data, using the numerical
simulations, we place more stringent limits down to 2 M_{Earth} near 1:2 and
2:1 mean motion resonances (MMRs) with WASP-5b at the 3 \sigma level, assuming
that the two planets are co-planer. We also put an upper limit on excess of

also find that if the possible secondary planet has non- or a small

photometric and spectroscopic observations will be required to confirm the
reality of the TTV signal, and results such as these will provide important

no rigorous and unified framework for simultaneously utilizing both

determine the jointly optimal power-control, AMC, and DPM policies; (ii) it
exploits partial information about the system so that less information needs to
be learned than when using conventional reinforcement learning algorithms; and
(iii) it obviates the need for action exploration, which severely limits the
adaptation speed and run-time performance of conventional reinforcement
learning algorithms. Our results show that the proposed learning algorithms can

highlighted the need for measures of fingerprint individuality when a person is

fingerprint individuality is to adequately capture the variability of
fingerprint features in a population. In this paper hierarchical mixture models
are introduced to infer the extent of individualization. Hierarchical mixtures
utilize complementary aspects of mixtures at different levels of the hierarchy.
At the first (top) level, a mixture is used to represent homogeneous groups of
fingerprints in the population, whereas at the second level, nested mixtures
are used as flexible representations of distributions of features from each
fingerprint. Inference for hierarchical mixtures is more challenging since the
number of unknown mixture components arise in both the first and second levels
of the hierarchy. A Bayesian approach based on reversible jump Markov chain
Monte Carlo methodology is developed for the inference of all unknown
parameters of hierarchical mixtures. The methodology is illustrated on
fingerprint images from the NIST database and is used to make inference on
fingerprint individuality estimates from this population.

various models. We discuss how the quenched lattice QCD results with
delocalized pion interpolators can be identified with the coarse grained wave
functions, typical of low-energy effective models. Actually, we find that
one-loop chiral quark models predict that pseudoscalar and tensor wave
functions have the same shape, while the axial component is more extended.
These facts are accurately confirmed by the lattice. We also show how the
transversity information, relevant for the light-cone physics, can be
straightforwardly obtained from the equal-time rest-frame lattice calculations.
This remarkable relation provides a way to extract, for instance, the
equal-time holographic wave functions and compare them, quite favorably, to the
lattice calculations.

$[u]$, such methods only maintain a concise fingerprint of the stream, and
perform computations using the fingerprints. The computations are done
approximately, and the required fingerprint size $k$ depends on the desired
accuracy $\epsilon$ and confidence $\delta$. Our technique maintains a single
bit per hash function, rather than a single integer, thus requiring a
fingerprint of length $k = O(\frac{\ln \frac{1}{\delta}}{\epsilon^2})$ bits,
rather than $O(\log u \cdot \frac{\ln \frac{1}{\delta}}{\epsilon^2})$ bits
required by previous approaches. The main advantage of the fingerprints we
propose is that rather than computing the fingerprint of a stream of $b$ items
in time of $O(b \cdot k)$, we can compute it in time $O(b \log k)$. Thus this
allows an exponential speedup for the fingerprint construction, or
alternatively allows achieving a much higher accuracy while preserving
computation time. Our methods rely on a specific family of pseudo-random hashes
for which we can quickly locate hashes resulting in small values.

to observe dwarf or subgiant stars. Abridged Although Li has been extensively
studied in the Galactic disk and halo, to date there is only one uncertain
detection of Li in an unevolved bulge star. AIMS: Our aim with this study is to
provide the first clear detection of Li in the Galactic bulge, based on an
analysis of a dwarf star that has largely retained its initial Li abundance.
METHODS: We have performed a detailed elemental abundance analysis of the bulge
dwarf star MOA-2010-BLG-285S using a high-resolution, and high signal-to-noise
spectrum obtained with the UVES spectrograph at the VLT when the object was
optically magnified during a gravitational microlensing event (visual
magnification A~550 during observation). The lithium abundance was determined
through synthetic line profile fitting of the 7Li resonance doublet line at
670.8 nm. The results have been corrected for departures from LTE. Results:
MOA-2010-BLG-285S is, at [Fe/H]=-1.23, the most metal-poor dwarf star detected
so far in the Galactic bulge. Its old age (12.5 Gyr) and enhanced [alpha/Fe]
ratios agree well with stars in the thick disk at similar metallicity. This
star represents the first unambiguous detection of Li in a metal-poor dwarf
star in the Galactic bulge. We find an NLTE corrected Li abundance of log
e(Li)=2.16, which is consistent with values derived for Galactic disk and halo
dwarf stars at similar metallicities and temperatures. Conclusion: Our results
show that there are no signs of Li enrichment or production in the Galactic
bulge during its earliest phases. Observations of Li in other galaxies (omega
Cen) and other components of the Galaxy suggest further that the Spite plateau
is universal.

and kinetic energy of SN ejecta is efficiently converted to thermal energy
which is eventually released as radiation. We find that explosions of RSGs are
affected by CSM in early epochs when mass-loss rate just before the explosions
is higher than 10^{-4} Msun/yr. Their characteristic features are that the LC
has a luminous round peak followed by a flat LC, that multicolor LCs are
simultaneously bright in ultraviolet and optical at the peak, and that
photospheric velocity is very low at these epochs. We calculate LCs for various
CSM conditions and explosion properties, i.e., mass-loss rates, radii of CSM,
density slopes of CSM, explosion energies of SN ejecta, and SN progenitors

days (=14.5226 hours), based on the measurements of radial velocity of a
complex of absorption features emanating from the K2-K4V type secondary
component. However, the radial velocity measurements from the emission lines
are best folded with the period Pem = 0.5743day (=13.78 hours). The
gamma-velocity of the emission lines varies significantly from epoch to epoch.
There is an underlying broader and weaker component to the emission lines,
which we could not resolve. Based on the appearance of the emission lines, the
presence of very strong He II lines and the moderate polarization detected by
Dillon et al. (2008), we conclude that SDSS J0018+3454 is an asynchronous

modeling studies for several planetary scenarios. A 1D radiative-convective
model was used to calculate temperature and pressure profiles of model
atmospheres, assumed to be composed of molecular nitrogen, water, and carbon
dioxide. The model allows for changing surface pressures caused by
evaporation/condensation of water and carbon dioxide. Furthermore, the
treatment of the energy transport has been improved in the model to account in
particular for high CO2, high-pressure Super-Earth conditions. For four
high-pressure scenarios of our study, the resulting surface temperatures were
above 273 K, indicating a potential habitability of the planet. These scenarios
include three CO2-dominated atmospheres (95% CO2 concentration with 5, 10, and
20 bar surface pressure) and a high-pressure CO2-enriched atmosphere (5% CO2
concentration with 20 bar surface pressure). For all other considered

to the incorporation of kernel functions. The latter allow to model
nonlinearity, but also to deal with nonnumerical data such as protein strings.
However, Support Vector Machines can suffer a lot from unclean data containing,
for example, outliers or mislabeled observations. Although several outlier
detection schemes have been proposed in the literature, the selection of
outliers versus nonoutliers is often rather ad hoc and does not provide much
insight in the data. In robust multivariate statistics outlier maps are quite
popular tools to assess the quality of data under consideration. They provide a
visual representation of the data depicting several types of outliers. This
paper proposes an outlier map designed for Support Vector Machine
classification. The Stahel--Donoho outlyingness measure from multivariate
statistics is extended to an arbitrary kernel space. A trimmed version of
Support Vector Machines is defined trimming part of the samples with largest
outlyingness. Based on this classifier, an outlier map is constructed
visualizing data in any type of high-dimensional kernel space. The outlier map
is illustrated on 4 biological examples showing its use in exploratory data
analysis.

messages(RCC), where a sender attempts to transmit common information to both a
receiver and a relay and also has private information intended for the receiver

confidential to the relay is measured by the equivocation rate, i.e., the
entropy rate of private information conditioned on channel outputs at the
relay. The performance measure of interest for the RCC is the rate triple that
includes the common rate, the private rate, and the equivocation rate as

all these achievable rate triples. In this paper we give two definitions of the

Only recently have other model groups or families like Marcs and
NextGen-Phoenix become available to the same extent. This study aims to
determine whether the predicted stellar flux of a disk target can change with
the choice of model family - can a disk excess be present in the use of one
model family whilst being absent from another? A simple comparison of Kurucz
model spectra with Mrcs and NextGen model spectra of identical stellar
parameters was conducted and differences were present at near-infrared
wavelengths. Model spectra often do not extend in wavelength to that of
observation and therefore extrapolation of the spectrum is required. In
extrapolation of model spectra to the Spitzer MIPS passbands, prediction of the
stellar contribution differed by 5 % at 70mum for F, G and early K spectral
types with differences increasing to 15% for early M dwarfs. Analysis of the
Spitzer MIPS 24mum observations of 37 F, G and K solar-like stars in the

were detected while only 3 and 4 excesses were detected in using Marcs and

depend on two key quantities: first, on the regularity of the target regression
function and second, on the intrinsic dimensionality of the data mapped into

the true regression function belongs to the reproducing kernel Hilbert space.

6 {\rm \mu G}$. A coherent magnetic field of this strength is more than
sufficient to dynamically stabilize the cloud against ram pressure stripping by
the Milky Way halo and may also provide thermal insulation for the cold cloud.
We estimate an upper limit to the ratio of random to coherent magnetic field of
$B_{r}/B_{||} < 0.8$, which suggests that the random field does not dominate
over the coherent field as it does in the Magellanic Clouds from which this HVC
likely originates.

interactions with the secondary component can actually significantly impact the
giant planet formation and evolution. Rare close binaries hosting giant planets
offer therefore an ideal laboratory to explore the properties and the stability
of such extreme planetary systems. In the course of our CFHT and VLT
coronographic imaging survey dedicated to the search for faint companions of
exoplanet host stars, a close (about 20 AU) secondary stellar companion to the
exoplanet host HD196885 A was discovered. For more than 4 years, we have used
the NaCo near-infrared adaptive optics instrument to monitor the astrometric
position of HD196885 B relative to A. The system was observed at five different
epochs from August 2005 to August 2009 and accurate relative positions were
determined. Our observations fully reject the stationary background hypothesis
for HD196885 B. The two components are found to be comoving. The orbital motion
of HD196885 B is well resolved and the orbital curvature is even detected. From
our imaging data combined with published radial velocity measurements, we
refine the complete orbital parameters of the stellar component. We derive for
the first time its orbital inclination and its accurate mass. We find also
solutions for the inner giant planet HD196885 Ab compatible with previous
independent radial velocity studies. Finally, we investigate the stability of
the inner giant planet HD196885 Ab due to the binary companion proximity. Our
dynamical simulations show that the system is currently and surprisingly more
stable in a high mutual inclination configuration that falls in the Kozai
resonance regime. If confirmed, this system would constitute one of the most
compact non-coplanar systems known so far. It would raise several questions
about its formation and stability

exclude data below the scale of statistical homogeneity, z < 0.033. Using all

favours the timescape model over the Lambda CDM model. We discuss the questions

Edgeworth-Kuiper belt zone is treated for semimajor axes 30-50 AU. Besides
solar gravity, also solar electromagnetic and corpuscular radiation, and, fast
interstellar gas flow are important forces influencing motion of the particles.
The solar electromagnetic radiation is represented by the Poynting-Robertson
effect and the solar corpuscular radiation corresponds to the solar wind.
Time-variability of the non-radial solar wind can significantly increase dust
lifetime in the zone. The average time for the particle stay in the zone is
more than 30-times greater than the conventional case of constant (time
independent) radial solar wind offers, for the particles of tens micrometers in
size. This holds for the most realistic material properties of the particles:
$\bar{Q}'_{pr} =$ 1, where $\bar{Q}'_{pr}$ is the dimensionless efficiency
factor for electromagnetic radiation pressure. If $\bar{Q}'_{pr} =$ 1/2, then
the average time of the particle stay in the zone is only 4-times the
conventional value. The approach used in the paper illustrates the relevance of
the solar wind action in comparison with the Poynting-Robertson effect. The
results have an important consequence for our understanding of the structure of

accommodate one or more keV sterile neutrinos as a natural candidate for warm
dark matter. To illustrate this point of view, we simply assume that there is
one keV sterile neutrino nu_4 and its flavor eigenstate nu_s weakly mixes with
three active neutrinos. We clarify different active-sterile neutrino mixing
factors for the radiative decay of nu_4 and beta decays in a self-consistent
parametrization. A direct detection of this keV sterile neutrino dark matter in
the laboratory is in principle possible since the nu_4 component of nu_e can
leave a distinct imprint on the electron energy spectrum when it is captured on
radioactive beta-decaying nuclei. We carry out an analysis of its signatures in
the capture reactions nu_e + ^{3}H \to ^{3}He + e^- and nu_e + ^{106}Ru \to
^{106}Rh + e^- against the beta-decay backgrounds, and conclude that this
experimental approach might not be hopeless in the long run.

low reheating temperature in the inflation model, and suggest the exciting

Three pulsars were discovered, and 16 previously known pulsars detected. In
this paper we present two previously-unpublished discoveries, both with
extremely high dispersion measures, one of which is very close, in angular
distance, to the Galactic centre. The survey data also contain the first known
detection, at radio frequencies, of the radio magnetar PSR J1550-5418. Our
survey observation was made 46 days prior to that previously published and

  The detection of only three previously undiscovered pulsars argues that there
are few pulsars in the direction of the inner Galaxy whose flux density
spectrum is governed by a flat power law. However, these pulsars would be
likely to remain undetected at lower frequencies due to the large amount of
scatter broadening which affects pulsars with high values of dispersion
measure. Surveys with future telescopes at high observing frequencies will,
therefore, play an important role in the discovery of pulsars at the Galactic
centre. By simulating pulsar surveys of the Galaxy with Phase 1 SKA at

the only way to discover and observe the Galactic-centre pulsar population.

branches into the subcritical parameter regime (a region of parameter space in

find that it is possible to generate a solution which is characterised by a

Kepko, and Spence (2008) examined 11 years of in-situ solar-wind density
measurements at 1 AU and demonstrated that not only turbulent structures, but
also non-turbulent periodic density structures exist in the solar wind with
scale sizes of hundreds to one thousand Mm. In a subsequent paper, Viall,
Spence, and Kasper (2009) analyzed the {\alpha} to proton solar-wind abundance
ratio measured during one such event of periodic density structures,
demonstrating that the plasma behavior was highly suggestive that either
temporally or spatially varying coronal source plasma created those density
structures. Large periodic density structures observed at 1 AU, which were
generated in the corona, can be observable in coronal and heliospheric
white-light images if they possess sufficiently high density contrast. Indeed,
we identify such periodic density structures as they enter the HI field of view
and follow them as they advect with the solar wind through the images. The
smaller periodic density structures that we identify in the images are
comparable in size to the larger structures analyzed in-situ at 1 AU, yielding
further evidence that periodic density enhancements are a consequence of
coronal activity as the solar wind is formed.

typical scenario includes about 10% of neutron stars born as magnetars,
significant magnetic field decay during the first million years of a NS life.
Evolutionary links between different subclasses may exist, although robust
conclusions are not yet possible.
  We apply the obtained field distribution and the model of decay to study
long-term evolution of neuton stars till the stage of accretion from the

be relatively long, initially highly magnetized neutron stars ($B_0 > \sim

kick velocities are not too large. The fact that in previous studies made $>$10
years ago, such objects were not considered results in a slight increase of the
Accretor fraction in comparison with earlier conclusions. Most of the neutron
stars similar to the Magnificent seven are expected to become accreting from

trajectories and (de)acceleration by the electric field component due to the
galactic rotation. The deflection of the cosmic ray trajectories makes the flux
intensity arriving to the halo from some direction to appear reaching the Earth
from another direction. This applies to any intrinsic anisotropy in the
extragalactic distribution or, even in the absence of intrinsic anisotropies,
to the dipolar Compton-Getting anisotropy induced when the observer is moving
with respect to the cosmic rays rest frame. For an observer moving with the
solar system, cosmic rays traveling through far away regions of the Galaxy also
experience an electric force coming from the relative motion (due to the
rotation of the Galaxy) of the local system in which the field can be
considered as being purely magnetic. This produces small changes in the
particles momentum that can originate large scale anisotropies even for an
isotropic extragalactic flux.

Our results show that bulk band structures present no significant differences.

semiconducting transport observed in Fe3O2BO3 are not present in Co3O2BO3. More
important differences were found to be related to local octahedral geometry.
Larger distortions in Co3O2BO3 lead to higher 2+ 3+ hopping barriers in the
triads and consequent localization of charge. In Fe3O2BO3, site equivalence
provides easy paths for inter-cation hopping. The present results indicate that
local geometry of the cation sites is the main cause of differences in these
two compounds; dimerization in the triads, which characterizes the structural

due to its simplicity and analytical tractability. Its key aspects include
fixed user locations and the deterministic and homogeneous interference
intensity. While clearly a significant simplification of a real cellular
system, which has random user locations and interference levels that vary by
several orders of magnitude over a cell, a common presumption by theorists is
that the Wyner model nevertheless captures the essential aspects of cellular
interactions. But is this true? To answer this question, we consider both
uplink and downlink transmissions, and both outage-based and average-based
metrics. For the uplink, for both metrics, we conclude that the Wyner model is
in fact quite accurate for systems with a sufficient number of simultaneous
users, e.g. CDMA. Conversely, it is broadly inaccurate otherwise. With
multicell processing, intracell TDMA is shown to be suboptimal in terms of
average throughput, in sharp contrast to predictions using the Wyner model.
Turning to the downlink, the Wyner model is highly inaccurate for outage since
it depends largely on the user locations. However, for average or sum
throughput, the Wyner model serves as an acceptable simplification in certain
special cases if the interference parameter is set appropriately.

ferromagnetic/metal to paramagnetic/insulator transition except the Pb doped
sample which is insulating and ferromagnetic in the entire temperature range.
The simultaneous occurrence of ferromagnetism and insulating behavior in Pb
doped compound is most likely due to the presence of FM clusters separated by
Fe and Mn ions that are coupled AFM and hence prevent the current from crossing
the inter-domain region. The magnetization and Tc are decreased by decreasing
the Cation size on La site. We observed that (for a fixed Fe content of 5%) the
transition temperature and magnetic moment at 77 K is a maximum for Sr doped
sample and is decreasing if we increase or decrease the cation size from Sr
size. The maximum value of Tc and magnetic moment for Sr based sample is most
likely due to the closer ionic sizes of La and Sr as compared to the other
dopants (Ca, Pb, Ba). The decrease in the transition temperature and magnetic
moment is due to the deviation of Mn-O-Mn angle from 1800 caused by the size
mismatch of the A site cations. This deviation leads to weakening of the FM
double exchange (DE). We observed a spin freezing type effect in the Pb doped
sample below 120 K in resistivity, AC susceptibility and in magnetization. This
suggests that the AFM interactions introduced by the Fe are most effective in
the Pb doped composition leading to increased competition between the FM and
AFM interactions. This FM and AFM interaction generates some degree of
frustration leading to the appearance of spin glass like phase whose typical
magnetic behavior is studied for small ion when the metallic like behavior is
lost.

galaxies with a separation in the sky plane 5h^-1 kpc < r_p <= r_p^max and a
relative velocity Delta v <= 500 km s^-1 in redshift space. We vary r_p^max
from 30h^-1 kpc to 100h^-1 kpc. We study f_m in two redshift intervals and for
several values of mu, the B-band luminosity ratio of the galaxies in the pair,
from 1/2 to 1/10. We take mu >= 1/4 and 1/10 <= mu < 1/4 as major and minor
mergers. The merger fraction increases with z and its dependence on mu is
described well as f_m (>= mu) proportional to mu^s. The value of s evolves from
s = -0.60 +- 0.08 at z = 0.8 to s = -1.02 +- 0.13 at z = 0.5. The fraction of
minor mergers for bright galaxies evolves with redshift as a power-law (1+z)^m
with index m = -0.4 +- 0.7 for the merger fraction and m = -0.5 +- 0.7 for the
merger rate. We split our principal galaxies in red and blue by their
rest-frame NUV-r colour, finding that i) f_m is higher for red galaxies, ii)
f_m^red does not evolve with z, and iii) f_m^blue evolves dramatically. Our
results show that the mass of normal L_B >= L*_B galaxies has grown ~25% since
z ~ 1 because of minor and major mergers. The relative contribution of the mass
growth by merging is ~25% due to minor mergers and ~75% due to major ones. The
relative effect of merging is more important for red than for blue galaxies,
with red galaxies subject to 0.5 minor and 0.7 major mergers since z~1, which
leads to a mass growth of ~40% and a size increase by a factor of 2. Our
results also suggest that, for blue galaxies, minor mergers likely lead to
early-type spirals rather than elliptical galaxies. These results show that
minor merging is a significant but not dominant mechanism driving the mass
growth of galaxies in the last ~8 Gyr (Abriged).

Langevin equations are employed to describe time-evolution of collective
coordinates with a time-dependent potential energy surface corresponding to
different stages of surrogate reactions. The new model is capable of
calculating spin distributions of the compound nuclei, one of the most
important quantity in the surrogate technique. Furthermore, various observables
of surrogate reactions can be calculated, e.g., energy and angular distribution
of ejectile, and mass distributions of fission fragments. These features are
important to assess validity of the proposed model itself, to understand
mechanisms of the surrogate reactions and to determine unknown parameters of
the model. It is found that spin distributions of compound nuclei produced in

parameters of a metamaterial based only on external measurements or
simulations, taking boundary effects at the interfaces between a conventional
material and metamaterial into account. Plane-wave reflection and transmission
coefficients at the interfaces are regarded as additional unknowns to be
determined, rather than explicitly dependent on the material parameters. Our
technique is thus analogous to the line-reflect-line (LRL) calibration method
in microwave measurements. The refractive index can be determined from
S-parameters for two samples of different thickness. The effective wave
impedance requires the additional assumption that generalized sheet transition
conditions (GSTCs) account for the boundary effects. Expressions for the bulk
permittivity and permeability then follow easily. Our method is validated by
comparison with the results using the Nicolson-Ross-Weir (NRW) for determining
properties of an ordinary material measured in a coaxial line. Utilizing
S-parameters obtained from 3-D full wave simulations, we test the method on
magnetodielectric metamaterials. We compare the results from our method and the

ultrashort, brilliant pulses are expected to allow single molecule diffraction
experiments providing structural information on the atomic length scale. This
ultimate goal, however, is currently hampered by several challenging questions
basically concerning sample damage, Coulomb explosion and the role of
nonlinearity. By employing an original \emph{ab-initio} approach, as well as
exceptional resources of parallel computing, we address these issues showing
that accurate XFEL-based single molecule imaging will be only possible with
ultrashort pulses of half of femtosecond, due to significant radiation damage
and the formation of preferred multi-soliton clusters which reshape the overall
electronic density of the molecular system at the femtosecond scale.
