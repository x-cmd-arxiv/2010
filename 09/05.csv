  relativistic plasmas",,,,,"physics.plasm-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The understanding of the physics of lasermatter interactions in the strongly
relativistic regime is of fundamental importance. In this article, a new
mechanism of fast electron generation at the vacuum-solid boundary of intense
laser pulse interaction with overdense plasma is described. It is one that has
no analogue in classical, non-relativistic laser-plasma interactions. Here,
conclusive proof is provided that the key contribution to the fast electron
generation is given by the zero points of the vector potential. We demonstrate
that the new mechanism leads to scalings for the fast electron energy, which
explicitly depend on the plasma density, thus providing a new insight into
relativistic laser-matter interaction. Furthermore, it is shown that this new
mechanism provides the dominant contribution to the interaction by the
injection of energy into the overdense plasma delivered by attosecondduration
electron bunches. This new understanding will allow the future generation of a
single ultra-bright attosecond X-ray pulse by suitable control of the laser
pulse polarization [1]-[7]. This process will also allow single pulse
attosecond electron bunches to be generated that can be further accelerated in
laser wakefield accelerators [8]-[10]. Other applications that will benefit
from this new insight include laser driven ion accelerators [11]-[15], fast
ignition inertial confinement fusion [16]-[18] as well as fundamental studies
at the intensity frontier [19]-[20].

However, similarities to the cuprate high-temperature superconductors suggest
that a similar mechanism may be at work. Recently, careful experimental studies
of the spin excitation spectrum revealed, like in the cuprates, a strong
temperature dependence in the normal state and a resonance feature in the
superconducting state. Motivated by these findings, we develop a model of
electrons interacting with a temperature dependent magnetic excitation spectrum
based on these experimental observations. We apply it to analyse angle resolved
photoemission and tunnelling spectra in Ba{1-x}KxFe2As2. We reproduce in
quantitative agreement with experiment a renormalisation of the quasiparticle
dispersion both in the normal and the superconducting state, and the dependence
of the quasiparticle linewidth on binding energy. We estimate the strength of
the coupling between electronic and spin excitations. Our findings support the
possibility of a pairing mechanism based dominantly on such a coupling.

properties remain elusive despite more than 50 years of intense research
activity. In this review we remind the reader of the noticeable properties of
these particles and of the stakes of the solar neutrino puzzle. The Standard
Solar Model triggered persistent efforts in fundamental Physics to predict the
solar neutrino fluxes, and its constantly evolving predictions have been
regularly compared to the detected neutrino signals. Anticipating that this
standard model could not reproduce the internal solar dynamics, a SEismic Solar
Model was developed which enriched theoretical neutrino flux predictions with
in situ observation of acoustic waves propagating in the Sun. This review
reminds the historical steps, from the pioneering Homestake detection, the
GALLEX- SAGE captures of the first pp neutrinos and emphasizes the importance
of the Superkamiokande and SNO detectors to demonstrate that the solar-emitted
electronic neutrinos are partially transformed into other neutrino flavors
before reaching the Earth. The success of BOREXINO in detecting the 7 Be
neutrino signal justifies the building of a new generation of detectors to
measure the entire solar neutrino spectrum. A coherent picture emerged from
neutrino physics and helioseismology. Today, new paradigms take shape:
determining the masses of neutrinos and the research on the Sun is focusing on
the dynamical aspects and on signature of dark matter. The third part of the
review is dedicated to this prospect. The understanding of the crucial role of
both rotation and magnetism in solar physics benefit from SoHO, SDO, and PICARD
space observations. For now, the particle and stellar challenges seem
decoupled, but this is only a superficial appearance. The development of
asteroseismology shows the far-reaching impact of Neutrino and Stellar
Astronomy.

molecule biophysics has generated a variety of novel time series data requiring
equally novel computational tools for analysis and inference. This article
describes in general terms how graphical modeling may be used to learn from
biophysical time series data using the variational Bayesian expectation
maximization algorithm (VBEM). The discussion is illustrated by the example of
single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) versus time
data, where the smFRET time series is modeled as a hidden Markov model (HMM)
with Gaussian observables. A detailed description of smFRET is provided as
well. Results: The VBEM algorithm returns the model's evidence and an
approximating posterior parameter distribution given the data. The former
provides a metric for model selection via maximum evidence (ME), and the latter
a description of the model's parameters learned from the data. ME/VBEM provide
several advantages over the more commonly used approach of maximum likelihood
(ML) optimized by the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, the most
important being a natural form of model selection and a well-posed
(non-divergent) optimization problem. Conclusions: The results demonstrate the
utility of graphical modeling for inference of dynamic processes in single
molecule biophysics.

been used to characterize the ability to extract global information from a

coherence is defined in terms of the singular vectors of a matrix and is

novel algorithm for estimating coherence from a small number of columns,
formally analyze its behavior, and derive a new coherence-based matrix

lensed CMB, Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ), and foreground contribution to the 148 GHz

that activate post-synaptic receptors. The amplitude of the post-synaptic
current, mostly mediated by glutamatergic (AMPARs) receptors, is a fundamental
signal that may generate an action potential. However, although various
simulation results \cite{kullman,Barbour,Raghavachari} have addressed how
synapses control the post-synaptic current, it is still unclear how this
current depends analytically on factors such as the synaptic cleft geometry,
the distribution, the number and the multi-conductance state of receptors, the
geometry of post-synaptic density (PSD) and the neurotransmitter release
location. To estimate the synaptic current maximal amplitude, we present a
semi-analytical model of glutamate diffusing in the synaptic cleft. We modeled
receptors as multi-conductance channels and we find that PSD morphological
changes can significantly modulate the synaptic current, which is maximally
reliable (the coefficient of variation is minimal) for an optimal size of the
PSD, that depends on the vesicular release active zone. The existence of an
optimal PSD size is related to nonlinear phenomena such as the multi-binding
cooperativity of the neurotransmitter to the receptors. We conclude that
changes in the PSD geometry can sustain a form of synaptic plasticity,
independent of a change in the number of receptors.

average revenue for the service provider under each client's long-term average
budget constraint, and design an online algorithm which captures the stochastic
properties of users' queries and click-through behaviors. We solve the
optimization problem by making connections to scheduling problems in wireless
networks, queueing theory and stochastic networks. Unlike prior models, we do
not assume that the number of query arrivals is known. Due to the stochastic
nature of the arrival process considered here, either temporary ""free"" service,
i.e., service above the specified budget or under-utilization of the budget is
unavoidable. We prove that our online algorithm can achieve a revenue that is
within $O(\epsilon)$ of the optimal revenue while ensuring that the overdraft
or underdraft is $O(1/\epsilon)$, where $\epsilon$ can be arbitrarily small.
With a view towards practice, we can show that one can always operate strictly
under the budget. In addition, we extend our results to a click-through rate
maximization model, and also show how our algorithm can be modified to handle
non-stationary query arrival processes and clients with short-term contracts.
  Our algorithm allows us to quantify the effect of errors in click-through
rate estimation on the achieved revenue. We also show that in the long run, an
expected overdraft level of $\Omega(\log(1/\epsilon))$ is unavoidable (a
universal lower bound) under any stationary ad assignment algorithm which
achieves a long-term average revenue within $O(\epsilon)$ of the offline
optimum.

non-linear device cuts across disciplinary boundaries. It is as relevant for
unmasking the dynamics of neurons in noisy environments as it is for designing
reliable nanoscale logic circuit elements and sensors. Most studies of noise in
non-linear devices are limited to either time-correlated noise with a
Lorentzian spectrum (of which the white noise is a limiting case) or just white
noise. We use analytical theory and numerical simulations to study the impact
of the more ubiquitous ""natural"" noise with a 1/f frequency spectrum.
Specifically, we study the impact of the 1/f noise on a leaky integrate and
fire model of a neuron. The impact of noise is considered on two quantities of
interest to neuron function: The spike count Fano factor and the speed of
neuron response to a small step-like stimulus. For the perfect (non-leaky)
integrate and fire model, we show that the Fano factor can be expressed as an
integral over noise spectrum weighted by a (low pass) filter function. This
result elucidates the connection between low frequency noise and disorder in
neuron dynamics. We compare our results to experimental data of single neurons
in vivo, and show how the 1/f noise model provides much better agreement than
the usual approximations based on Lorentzian noise. The low frequency noise,
however, complicates the case for information coding scheme based on interspike
intervals by introducing variability in the neuron response time. On a positive
note, the neuron response time to a step stimulus is, remarkably, nearly
optimal in the presence of 1/f noise. An explanation of this effect elucidates
how the brain can take advantage of noise to prime a subset of the neurons to
respond almost instantly to sudden stimuli.

for flavor neutrino masses given by M_{ij} (i,j=e,\mu,\tau), two conditions of

dichroism is derived from the basic Kramers-Kronig relations. In our discussion
of the general theory of molecular optical activity we introduce the tensor of
molecular optical activity. It is shown that to evaluate the optical rotation
and circular dichroism at arbitrary frequencies one needs to know only nine (3

optical activity is also briefly discussed. We also raise the possibility of
measuring the optical rotation and circular dichroism at wavelengths which

in many computer vision applications. Extraction of effective features is the
key to this task. Promising features should be discriminative, robust to
various variations and easy to compute. In this work, we present novel
features, termed dense center-symmetric local binary patterns (CS-LBP) and
pyramid center-symmetric local binary/ternary patterns (CS-LBP/LTP), for
pedestrian detection. The standard LBP proposed by Ojala et al. \cite{c4}
mainly captures the texture information. The proposed CS-LBP feature, in
contrast, captures the gradient information and some texture information.
Moreover, the proposed dense CS-LBP and the pyramid CS-LBP/LTP are easy to
implement and computationally efficient, which is desirable for real-time
applications. Experiments on the INRIA pedestrian dataset show that the dense
CS-LBP feature with linear supporct vector machines (SVMs) is comparable with
the histograms of oriented gradients (HOG) feature with linear SVMs, and the
pyramid CS-LBP/LTP features outperform both HOG features with linear SVMs and
the start-of-the-art pyramid HOG (PHOG) feature with the histogram intersection

used in ecology and epidemiology to model stochastic dynamics of the population
of interest. In clinical settings, multiple birth-death processes can describe
disease trajectories of individual patients, allowing for estimation of the
effects of individual covariates on the birth and death rates of the process.
Such estimation is usually accomplished by analyzing patient data collected at
unevenly spaced time points, referred to as panel data in the biostatistics
literature. Fitting linear BDI processes to panel data is a nontrivial
optimization problem because birth and death rates can be functions of many
parameters related to the covariates of interest. We propose a novel
expectation--maximization (EM) algorithm for fitting linear BDI models with
covariates to panel data. We derive a closed-form expression for the joint
generating function of some of the BDI process statistics and use this
generating function to reduce the E-step of the EM algorithm, as well as
calculation of the Fisher information, to one-dimensional integration. This
analytical technique yields a computationally efficient and robust optimization
algorithm that we implemented in an open-source R package. We apply our method
to DNA fingerprinting of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of
tuberculosis, to study intrapatient time evolution of IS6110 copy number, a
genetic marker frequently used during estimation of epidemiological clusters of
Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections. Our analysis reveals previously
undocumented differences in IS6110 birth-death rates among three major lineages
of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which has important implications for
epidemiologists that use IS6110 for DNA fingerprinting of Mycobacterium
tuberculosis.

(DCs) to uptake iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) is assessed and a
strategy to induce selective cell death in these MNP-loaded DCs using external
alternating magnetic fields (AMFs) is reported. No significant decrease in the
cell viability of MNP-loaded DCs, compared to the control samples, was observed
after five days of culture. The amount of MNPs incorporated into the cytoplasm
was measured by magnetometry, which confirmed that 1 to 5 pg of the particles
were uploaded per cell. The intracellular distribution of these MNPs, assessed
by transmission electron microscopy, was found to be primarily inside the
endosomic structures. These cells were then subjected to an AMF for 30 min, and
the viability of the blank DCs (i.e., without MNPs), which were used as control
samples, remained essentially unaffected. However, a remarkable decrease of
viability from approximately 90% to 2-5% of DCs previously loaded with MNPs was
observed after the same 30 min exposure to an AMF. The same results were
obtained using MNPs having either positive (NH2+) or negative (COOH-) surface
functional groups. In spite of the massive cell death induced by application of
AMF to MNP-loaded DCs, the amount of incorporated magnetic particles did not
raise the temperature of the cell culture. Clear morphological changes at the
cell structure after magnetic field application were observed using scanning
electron microscopy. Therefore, local damage produced by the MNPs could be the
main mechanism for the selective cell death of MNP-loaded DCs under an AMF.
Based on the ability of these cells to evade the reticuloendothelial system,
these complexes combined with an AMF should be considered as a potentially
powerful tool for tumour therapy.

process of examining genealogical records to determine which pairs of
individuals are parent and child. New methods to automate this process take as
input genetic data from a set of extant individuals and reconstruct ancestral
individuals. There is a great need to evaluate the quality of these methods by
comparing the estimated pedigree to the true pedigree.
  In this paper, we consider two main pedigree comparison problems. The first
is the pedigree isomorphism problem, for which we present a linear-time
algorithm for leaf-labeled pedigrees. The second is the pedigree edit distance
problem, for which we present 1) several algorithms that are fast and exact in
various special cases, and 2) a general, randomized heuristic algorithm.
  In the negative direction, we first prove that the pedigree isomorphism
problem is as hard as the general graph isomorphism problem, and that the
sub-pedigree isomorphism problem is NP-hard. We then show that the pedigree
edit distance problem is APX-hard in general and NP-hard on leaf-labeled
pedigrees.
  We use simulated pedigrees to compare our edit-distance algorithms to each
other as well as to a branch-and-bound algorithm that always finds an optimal
solution.

stable, featuring a virtually vanishing real instability eigenvalue. The
solitons become unstable in the case of the slowly relaxing nonlinearity. The
character of the instability alters with the increase of the delay time, which

robust localized breathers in rapidly relaxing media, and decay into

catalog probes deep into the halo where substructures are expected to be
abundant and easy to detect. Our analysis reveals 16 structures at high
Galactic latitude (greater than 15 degree), of which 10 have been previously
identified. Among the six new structures two could plausibly be due to masks
applied to the data, one is associated with a strong extinction region and one
is probably a part of the Monoceros ring. Another one originates at low
latitudes, suggesting some contamination from disk stars, but also shows
protrusions extending to high latitudes, implying that it could be a real
feature in the stellar halo. The last remaining structure is free from the
defects discussed above and hence is very likely a satellite remnant. Although
the extinction in the direction of the structure is very low, the structure
does match a low temperature feature in the dust maps. While this casts some
doubt on its origin, the low temperature feature could plausibly be due to real
dust in the structure itself. The angular position and distance of this
structure encompass the Pisces overdensity traced by RR Lyraes in Stripe 82 of
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). However, the 2MASS M-giants indicate that
the structure is much more extended than what is visible with the SDSS, with
the point of peak density lying just outside Stripe 82. The morphology of the

employed the LLmodels stellar model atmosphere code to predict the light
variability in different photometric systems. The rotational period of epsUMa
is refined to 5d088631(18). It is shown that the observed light variability can
be explained as a result of the redistribution of radiative flux from the UV
spectral region to the visual caused by the inhomogeneous surface distribution
of chemical elements. Among seven mapped elements, only Fe and Cr significantly
contribute to the amplitude of the observed light variability. In general, we
find a very good agreement between theory and observations. We confirm the
important role of Fe and Cr to the magnitude of the well-known depression
around 5200 \AA\ through the analysis of the peculiar $a$-parameter. Finally,
we show that the abundance spots of considered elements cannot explain the
observed variability in near UV and $\beta$ index which are likely due to some
other causes. The inhomogeneous surface distribution of chemical elements can

the Machian energy of collective gravitational interactions of all particles
inside the horizon. It is shown that the fine structure constant can be
expressed in terms of the observed radiative, baryon and dark energy densities
of the universe and the densities of various matter components are interrelated
via it.
