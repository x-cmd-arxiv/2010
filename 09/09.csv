dislocations in gamma-TiAl which leads to the characteristic trailing of
dipoles in the microstructure. While it has been proposed that these may be
variously intrinsic or extrinsic in nature, we are able to rule out the former
mechanism. We do this by means of very large scale, three dimensional atomistic
simulations using the quantum mechanical bond order potential. We find that the
kink-pair formation energy is large: 6eV, while the single kink migration
energy is conversely very small: 0.13eV. Using these, and other atomistically
derived data, we make kinetic Monte Carlo simulations at realistic time and
length scales to simulate dislocation mobility as a function of stress and
temperature. In the temperature range of the stress anomaly in gamma-TiAl, we
determine whether one or several of the pinning and unzipping processes
associated with generation of jogs are observed during our simulations. We
conclude that the pinning of ordinary dislocations and anomalous mechanical
behaviour in gamma-TiAl must be attributed to a combination of extrinsic
obstacles and extensive cross-slip in a crystal containing impurities.

condensations in the progenitor medium. However, as the cloud is forming, it
also becomes bound, and gravitational accelerations dominate the motions.
Energy conservation in this case implies $|E_g| \sim E_k$, in agreement with
observational data, and providing an interpretation for two recent
observational results: the scatter in the $\delta v-R$ plane, and the
dependence of the velocity dispersion on the surface density ${\delta v^2/ R}

molecular clouds in a state of hierarchical gravitational collapse, i.e.,
developing local centers of collapse throughout the whole cloud while the cloud
itself is collapsing, and making equilibrium unnecessary at all stages prior to
the formation of actual stars. Finally, we discuss how this mechanism need not
be in conflict with the observed star formation rate.

four additional clusters from the literature (M15, M22, M55, NGC362), and with
additional literature data on NGC288. In this first paper, we measured the
strength of CN and CH band indices, and we investigated the anti-correlation
and bimodality of these indices. We compared r_CN, the ratio of stars belonging
to the CN-strong and weak groups, with 15 different cluster parameters. We
clearly see bimodal anti-correlation of the CH and CN band stregths in the
metal-rich clusters (Pal12, 47Tuc, NGC6352, NGC5927). Only M15 among the
metal-poor clusters shows a clearly bimodal anti-correlation. We found weak
correlations (sligthly above 1 sigma) of r_CN with the cluster orbital
parameters, present-day total mass, cluster concentration, and age. Our
findings support the self-enrichment scenario, and suggest that the occurrence
of more than two major generations of stars in a GGC should be rare. Small
additional generations (<10-20% of the total) would be difficult to detect with
our samples. The first generation, which corresponds to the CN-weak stars,
usually contains more stars than the second one (<r_CN>=0.82+/-0.29), as
opposed to results based on the Na-O anti-correlations.

observable consequences of the theory. In the search for quantum gravity,
research in phenomenology has been dominated by models violating Lorentz
invariance (LI) -- despite there being, at present, no evidence that LI is
violated. Causal set theory is a LI candidate theory of QG that seeks not to
quantise gravity as such, but rather to develop a new understanding of the
universe from which both GR and QM could arise separately. The key hypothesis
is that spacetime is a discrete partial order: a set of events where the
partial ordering is the physical causal ordering between the events. This
thesis investigates Lorentz invariant QG phenomenology motivated by the causal
set approach. Massive particles propagating in a discrete spacetime will
experience diffusion in both position and momentum in proper time. This thesis
considers this idea in more depth, providing a rigorous derivation of the
diffusion equation in terms of observable cosmic time. The diffusion behaviour
does not depend on any particular underlying particle model. Simulations of
three different models are conducted, revealing behaviour that matches the
diffusion equation despite limitations on the size of causal set simulated. The
effect of spacetime discreteness on the behaviour of massless particles is also
investigated. Diffusion equations in both affine time and cosmic time are
derived, and it is found that massless particles undergo diffusion and drift in
energy. Constraints are placed on the magnitudes of the drift and diffusion
parameters by considering the blackbody nature of the CMB. Spacetime
discreteness also has a potentially observable effect on photon polarisation.
For linearly polarised photons, underlying discreteness is found to cause a
rotation in polarisation angle and a suppression in overall polarisation.

  problem",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we develop new applications of variational analysis and
generalized differentiation to the following optimization problem and its
specifications: given n closed subsets of a Banach space, find such a point for
which the sum of its distances to these sets is minimal. This problem can be
viewed as an extension of the celebrated Fermat-Torricelli problem: given three
points on the plane, find another point such that the sum of its distances to
the designated points is minimal. The generalized Fermat-Torricelli problem
formulated and studied in this paper is of undoubted mathematical interest and
is promising for various applications including those frequently arising in
location science, optimal networks, etc. Based on advanced tools and recent
results of variational analysis and generalized differentiation, we derive
necessary as well as necessary and sufficient optimality conditions for the
extended version of the Fermat-Torricelli problem under consideration, which
allow us to completely solve it in some important settings. Furthermore, we
develop and justify a numerical algorithm of the subgradient type to find
optimal solutions in convex settings and provide its numerical implementations.

flows combining direct numerical simulations, large eddy simulations, and
phenomenological theory. Several cases are considered: (1) the effect of
varying the characteristic scale of the initial conditions when compared with
the size of the box, to mimic ""bounded"" and ""unbounded"" flows; (2) the effect
of helicity (correlation between the velocity and vorticity); (3) the effect of
Rossby and Reynolds numbers; and (4) the effect of anisotropy in the initial
conditions. Initial conditions include the Taylor-Green vortex, the
Arn'old-Beltrami-Childress flow, and random flows with large-scale energy
spectrum proportional to $k^4$. The decay laws obtained in the simulations for
the energy, helicity, and enstrophy in each case can be explained with
phenomenological arguments that separate the decay of two-dimensional from
three-dimensional modes, and that take into account the role of helicity and
rotation in slowing down the energy decay. The time evolution of the energy
spectrum and development of anisotropies in the simulations are also discussed.
Finally, the effect of rotation and helicity in the skewness and kurtosis of
the flow is considered.

IRS 9A. Our goal is to investigate with infrared interferometry the structure
of IRS 9A on scales as small as 200AU, exploiting the fact that a cluster of O
and B stars has blown away much of the obscuring foreground dust and gas.
Observations in the N-band were carried out with the MIDI beam combiner
attached to the VLTI. Additional interferometric observations which probe the
structure of IRS 9A on larger scales were performed with an aperture mask
installed in the T-ReCS instrument of Gemini South. The spectral energy
distribution (SED) is constrained by the MIDI N-band spectrum and by data from
the Spitzer Space Telescope. Our efforts to model the structure and SED of IRS
9A range from simple geometrical models of the brightness distribution to one-
and two-dimensional radiative transfer computations. The target is resolved by
T-ReCS, with an equivalent (elliptical) Gaussian width of 330mas by 280mas
(2300 AU by 2000 AU). Despite this fact, a warm compact unresolved component
was detected by MIDI which is possibly associated with the inner regions of a
flattened dust distribution. Based on our interferometric data, no sign of
multiplicity was found on scales between about 200AU and 700AU projected
separation. A geometric model consisting of a warm (1000 K) ring (400 AU
diameter) and a cool (140 K) large envelope provides a good fit to the data. No
single model fitting all visibility and photometric data could be found, with
disk models performing better than spherical models. While the data are clearly
inconsistent with a spherical dust distribution they are insufficient to prove
the existence of a disk but rather hint at a more complex dust distribution.

sensor technology, wireless sensor network (WSN) systems have begun to take
significant roles in various applications ranging from environmental sensing to
mobile healthcare sensing. While some WSN applications only require a lim- ited
amount of bandwidth, new emerging applications operate with a notice- ably
large amount of data transfers. One way to deal with such applications is to
maximize the available capacity by utilizing the use of multiple wireless
channels. This work proposes DynaChannAl, a distributed dynamic wireless
channel algorithm with the goal of effectively distributing nodes on multiple
wireless channels in WSN systems. Specifically, DynaChannAl targets applica-
tions where mobile nodes connect to a pre-existing wireless backbone and takes
the expected end-to-end queuing delay as its core metric. We use the link qual-
ity indicator (LQI) values provided by IEEE 802.15.4 radios white-list
potential links with good link quality and evaluate such links with the
aggregated packet transmission latency at each hop. Our approach is useful for
applications that require minimal end-to-end delay (i.e., healthcare
applications). DynaChannAl is a light weight and highly adoptable scheme that
can be easily incorporated with various pre-developed components and
pre-deployed applications. We eval- uate DynaChannAl in on a 45 node WSN
testbed. As the first study to consider end-to-end latency as the core metric
for channel allocation in WSN systems, the experimental results indicate that
DynaChannAl successfully distributes multi- ple (mobile) source nodes on
different wireless channels and enables the nodes to select wireless channel
and links that can minimize the end-to-end latency.

of triangulations. This study leads to interpret multitriangulations by duality
as pseudoline arrangements with contact points covering a given support. We
exploit finally these results to discuss some open problems on
multitriangulations, in particular the question of the polytopal realization of
their flip graphs.

to time that the AB effect is somehow a consequence of a local classical
electromagnetic field phenomenon involving energy that is temporarily stored in
the overlap between the external field and the field of which the beam particle
is the source. That idea was shown in the past not to work for some models of
the source of the external field. Here a more general proof is presented for
the magnetic AB effect to show that the overlap energy is always compensated by
another contribution to the energy of the magnetic field in such a way that the

an observed scatter of 0.15 dex. We also find that, at fixed Mstar, the ratio
Mstar/Mdyn depends strongly on galaxy structure, as parameterized by Sersic
index, n. The size of the differential effect is on the order of 0.6 dex across
2 < n < 10. The apparent n-dependence of Mstar/Mdyn is similar to expectations
from simple models, indicating that assuming homology gives the wrong dynamical
mass. We have also derived dynamical mass estimates that explicitly account for
differences in galaxies' profiles. Using this `structure-corrected' dynamical
mass estimator, M(dyn,n), the best fit relation is Mstar = M(dyn,n)**(0.92 +-
0.08) with an observed scatter of 0.13 dex. While the data are thus consistent
with a linear relation, they do prefer a slightly shallower slope. Further, we
see only a small residual trend in Mstar/M(dyn,n) with n. We find no
statistically significant systematic trends in Mstar/M(dyn,n) as a function of
observed quantities (e.g, apparent magnitude, redshift), or as a function of
tracers of stellar populations. The net differential bias in Mstar/M(dyn,n)

the Spitzer cores to disks and Gould's Belt surveys. We estimate the gas

(Sigma_SFR) from the number of YSOs, assuming a mean mass and lifetime. We also
divide the clouds into contour levels of Av, counting only the youngest Class I

find that Galactic clouds lie above the extragalactic relations (e.g.,
Kennicutt-Schmidt Law) by factors up to 17. Cloud regions with high Sigma_gas
lie above extragalactic relations up to a factor of 54 and overlap with massive
clumps. We use 12CO and 13CO gas maps of the Perseus and Ophiuchus clouds to
estimate Sigma_gas and compare to Sigma_gas from Av maps. We find that 13CO,
underestimates the Av-based mass by factors of 4-5. 12CO may underestimate the
total gas mass at Sigma_gas > 200 Msun pc^-2 by > 30%;however, this does not
explain the large discrepancy between Galactic and extragalactic relations. We
find evidence for a threshold of star formation (Sigma_th) at 129+-14 Msun
pc^-2. At Sigma_gas > Sigma_th, the Galactic relation is linear. A possible
reason for the difference between Galactic and extragalactic relations is that
all the CO-emitting gas, including Sigma_gas below Sigma_th, is measured in
extragalactic studies. If the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation (Sigma_SFR
Sigma_gas^1.4) and a linear relation between dense gas and star formation is
assumed, the fraction of dense star forming gas (f_dense) increases as
Sigma_gas^0.4. When Sigma_gas reaches ~300Sigma_th, f_dense is 1. (Abridged)

respect to a ""classical"" Monte Carlo RT, especially when combined with an
Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) scheme. Among several new features, RADAMESH is
able to adaptively refine the computational mesh in correspondence of the
I-fronts, allowing to fully resolve them within large, cosmological boxes. We
follow the propagation of ionizing radiation from an arbitrary number of

for angular momentum of large scale structures as a function of mass, and
average speed of substructures within large scale structures. The analysis also
indicates relaxation times for star clusters are generally less than the age of
the universe and relaxation times for more massive structures are greater than
the age of the universe.

O, has about S, and the work necessary to erase a system may therefore vary for
different observers. Here, we consider a general setting where the information

proportional to H(S|O) is still sufficient to erase S. Since the entropy H(S|O)

a corresponding cooling of the environment).

range mostly from 10$^9$L$_\odot$ to $10^{13.5}$L$_\odot$, with 83% in the
range 10$^{10}$L$_\odot$$<$L$_{\rm IR}$$<10^{12}$L$_\odot$. The redshifts range
from 0.008 to 4.27, with a median of 0.144. The equivalent widths of the
6.2\,$\mu$m aromatic feature have a bimodal distribution. We use the
6.2\,$\mu$m PAH EW to classify our objects as SB-dominated (44%), SB-AGN
composite (22%), and AGN-dominated (34%). The high EW objects (SB-dominated)
tend to have steeper mid-IR to far-IR spectral slopes and lower L$_{\rm IR}$
and redshifts. The low EW objects (AGN-dominated) tend to have less steep
spectral slopes and higher L$_{\rm IR}$ and redshifts. This dichotomy leads to
a gross correlation between EW and slope, which does not hold within either
group. AGN dominated sources tend to have lower log(L$_{\rm PAH 7.7\mu
m}$/L$_{\rm PAH 11.3\mu m}$) ratios than star-forming galaxies, possibly due to
preferential destruction of the smaller aromatics by the AGN. The log(L$_{\rm
PAH 7.7\mu m}$/L$_{\rm PAH 11.3\mu m}$) ratios for star-forming galaxies are
lower in our sample than the ratios measured from the nuclear spectra of nearby
normal galaxies, most probably indicating a difference in the ionization state
or grain size distribution between the nuclear regions and the entire galaxy.
Finally, we provide a calibration relating the monochromatic 5.8, 8, 14 and
24um continuum or Aromatic Feature luminosity to L$_{\rm IR}$ for different

problems that defy existing, classical, computers. The theory of computational
complexity, one of the crown jewels of computer science, provides a rigorous
framework for classifying the hardness of problems according to the
computational resources, most notably time, needed to solve them. Its extension
to quantum computers allows the relative power of quantum computers to be
analyzed. This framework identifies families of problems which are likely hard
for classical computers (``NP-complete'') and those which are likely hard for
quantum computers (``QMA-complete'') by indirect methods. That is, they
identify problems of comparable worst-case difficulty without directly
determining the individual hardness of any given instance. Statistical
mechanical methods can be used to complement this classification by directly
extracting information about particular families of instances---typically those
that involve optimization---by studying random ensembles of them. These pose
unusual and interesting (quantum) statistical mechanical questions and the
results shed light on the difficulty of problems for large classes of
algorithms as well as providing a window on the contrast between typical and
worst case complexity. In these lecture notes we present an introduction to
this set of ideas with older work on classical satisfiability and recent work
on quantum satisfiability as primary examples. We also touch on the connection
of computational hardness with the physical notion of glassiness.

described by a power-law (photon index $\alpha=1.87\pm0.09$) with a remarkable

rest velocity, and they exhibit a quantitatively different line profile from

point-like emission sources such as the HII regions surrounding individual star
clusters. The size of the SiII* emitting region is estimated to be ~ 250 pc. We
discuss the possibility of this emission arising in overlapping super star

classified as SSSs, one is a candidate SSS. Two SSSs are still visible more
than nine years after the nova outburst, whereas two other nova counterparts
show a short SSS phase of less than 150 days. Of the latter sources, M31N
2006-04a exhibits a short-time variable X-ray light curve with an apparent
period of (1.6+-0.3) h. This periodicity could indicate the binary period of

are not detected anymore. Additionally, we found four SSSs in our XMM-Newton
data without a nova counterpart, one of which is a new source. Out of eleven
SSSs detected in our monitoring, seven are counterparts of CNe. We therefore
confirm the earlier finding that CNe are the major class of SSSs in the central
region of M 31. We use the measured SSS turn-on and turn-off times to estimate
the mass ejected in the nova outburst and the mass burned on the white dwarf.
Classical novae with short SSS phases seem to be an important contributor to

thin-film micromagnetics. It consists in a free-energy functional depending on
two small parameters $\eps$ and $\eta$ and defined over $S^2-$vector fields $m$
that are tangent at the boundary of a two-dimensional domain $\Omega$. We are
interested in the behavior of minimizers as $\eps, \eta \to 0$. The minimizers
tend to be in-plane away from a region of length scale $\eps$ (generically, an
interior vortex ball or two boundary vortex balls) and of vanishing divergence,
so that $S^1-$transition layers of length scale $\eta$ (N\'eel walls) are
enforced by the boundary condition. We first prove an upper bound for the
minimal energy that corresponds to the cost of a vortex and the configuration
of N\'eel walls associated to the viscosity solution, so-called Landau state.
Our main result concerns the compactness of vector fields $m_{\eps, \eta}$ of
energies close to the Landau state in the regime where a vortex is
energetically more expensive than a N\'eel wall. Our method uses techniques
developed for the Ginzburg-Landau type problems for the concentration of energy
on vortex balls, together with an approximation argument of $S^2-$vector fields
by $S^1-$vector fields away from the vortex balls.

scaling between the (kpc-averaged) surface density of molecular gas (\Sigma_H2)
and recent star formation rate (\Sigma_SFR) relates to individual star-forming
regions. To do this, we measure the ratio of CO emission to
extinction-corrected Halpha emission in apertures of varying sizes centered
both on peaks of CO and Halpha emission. We parameterize this ratio as a
molecular gas (H_2) depletion time (\tau_dep). On large (kpc) scales, our
results are consistent with a molecular star formation law (Sigma_SFR \sim
Sigma_H2^b) with b \sim 1.1 - 1.5 and a median \tau_dep \sim 1 Gyr, with no
dependence on type of region targeted. Below these scales, \tau_dep is a strong
function of adopted angular scale and the type of region that is targeted.
Small (\lesssim 300pc) apertures centered on CO peaks have very long \tau_dep
(i.e., high CO-to-Halpha flux ratio) and small apertures targeted toward Halpha
peaks have very short \tau_dep. This implies that the star formation law
observed on kpc scales breaks down once one reaches aperture sizes of \lesssim
300pc. For our smallest apertures (75pc), the difference in \tau_dep between
the two types of regions is more than one order of magnitude. This scale
behavior emerges from averaging over star-forming regions with a wide range of
CO-to-Halpha ratios with the natural consequence that the breakdown in the star
formation law is a function of the surface density of the regions studied. We
consider the evolution of individual regions the most likely driver for
region-to-region differences in \tau_dep (and thus the CO-to-Halpha ratio).

emissions play on the photochemical and photoionization evolution of early,
young planetary atmospheres and ionospheres. Motivated by the current
exoplanetary search missions that are hunting for earth-size planets in the
habitable zones of nearby main-sequence G-M stars, we are expanding our program
to cooler, less luminous, but much more numerous main-sequence K-type stars,
such as alpha Centauri B. The long life (2-3x longer than our Sun) and slow
evolution of K stars provide nearly constant energy sources for possible hosted
planets. Presented here are X-ray, UV, and recently acquired FUV observations
of the K1 V star alpha Cen B. These combined high-energy measures provide a
more complete look into the nature of alpha Cen B's magnetic activity and X-UV
radiances. We find that alpha Cen B has exhibited significant long-term
variability in X-ray through NUV emission fluxes, indicating a solar-like
long-term activity cycle of P_cycle = 8.84 years. In addition, analysis of the
short-term rotational modulation of mean light due to the effects of
magnetically active regions has yielded a well-determined rotation period of
P_rotation = 36.2 days. alpha Cen B is the only old main-sequence K star with a
reliably determined age and rotation period, and for early K-stars, is an
important calibrator for stellar age/rotation/activity relations.

of the gap equation that Delta necessarily exists in the normal phase in a

linear inversion and model selection techniques to produce reliable
cross-identification catalogues based on Spitzer MIPS 24 micron source
positions. Testing on simulations and real Herschel observations show that this
approach gives robust results for even the faintest sources S250~10 mJy. We
apply our new technique to HerMES SPIRE observations taken as part of the
science demostration phase of Herschel. For our real SPIRE observations we show
that, for bright unconfused sources, our flux density estimates are in good
agreement with those produced via more traditional point source detection
methods (SussExtractor; Savage & Oliver et al. 2006) by Smith et al. 2010. When
compared to the measured number density of sources in the SPIRE bands, we show
that our method allows the recovery of a larger fraction of faint sources than
these traditional methods. However this completeness is heavily dependant on
the relative depth of the existing 24 micron catalogues and SPIRE imaging.
Using our deepest multi-wavelength dataset in GOODS-N, we estimate that the use
of shallow 24 micron in our other fields introduces an incompleteness at faint
levels of between 20-40 per cent at 250 micron.

their global FIR and radio synchrotron luminosities, which is believed to be
ultimately the result of the formation of massive stars. Two colliding pairs of
galaxies, UGC12914/5 and UGC 813/6 deviate from this correlation and show an
excess of radio emission which in both cases originates to a large extent in a
gas bridge connecting the two galactic disks. We are aiming to clarify the
origin of the radio continuum emission from the bridge. The radio synchrotron
emission expected from the bridge regions is calculated, assuming that the
kinetic energy liberated in the predominantly gas dynamic interaction of the
respective interstellar media (ISM) has produced shock waves that efficiently
accelerate nuclei and electrons to relativistic energies. We present a model
for this acceleration and calculate the resulting radio emission, its spectral
index and the expected high-energy gamma-ray emission. It is found that the
nonthermal energy produced in the collision is large enough to explain the
radio emission from the bridge between the two galaxies. The calculated
spectral index at the present time also agrees with the observed value. The
deviation of these two interacting galaxy systems from the standard FIR-radio
correlation is consistent with the acceleration of an additional population of
electrons. This process is not related to star formation and therefore it is
expected that the systems do not follow the FIR-radio correlation. The
acceleration of relativistic electrons in shocks caused by an ISM collision, in
the same way as described here, is likely to take place in other systems as
well, as in galaxy clusters and groups or high-redshift systems.

have an average q_{24} ratio which is better fit by local LIRG SEDs rather than
local ULIRG SEDs, indicating that high redshift ULIRGs differ in their IR/radio

these benchmarks from existing searches, estimate the discovery potential with
10 fb^-1, and discuss ways in which these searches can be optimized for slepton
co-NLSPs. We also analyze the Tevatron constraints on a scenario with light
gluinos that could be discovered at the early LHC. Overall, we find that the
Tevatron still has excellent reach for the discovery of SUSY in multilepton
final states. Finally, we comment on the possible interpretation of a mild
""excess"" in the CDF same-sign dilepton search in terms of slepton co-NLSPs.

will likely provide the most accurate measurements for the ionizing photon
rates (star formation rates; SFRs) of normal galaxies since their non-thermal
emission should be highly suppressed due to the increased inverse Compton (IC)
losses from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), leaving only thermal
(free-free) emission detectable. Thus, a careful analysis of such observations
in combination with future ALMA and JWST data, measuring the rest-frame
far-infrared and UV emission from the same population of galaxies, may yield
the best means to search for variability in the stellar IMF at such epochs.

This method allows for an enormous reduction in the amount of memory and CPU

considerably improved by this method.

superaging scenario was postulated for the autocorrelation function in
disordered ferromagnets. We also study the scaling behavior of the space-time

singularities along the fifth dimension despite the existence of a mass gap in
the graviton spectrum as it happens in thick branes with 4D Poincare symmetry,
providing a simple model with very good features: the curvature is completely
smooth along the fifth dimension, it localizes 4D gravity and the spectrum of
gravity fluctuations presents a mass gap, a fact that rules out the existence
of phenomenologically dangerous ultralight KK excitations in the model. We
finally present our solution as a limit of scalar thick branes.

been regarded as one of the most significant structural characteristics of
social and information networks. Node degree, however, only discloses the
first-order structure of a network. Higher-order structures such as the edge
embeddedness and the size of communities may play more important roles in many
online social networks. In this paper, we provide empirical evidence on the
existence of rich higherorder structural characteristics in online social
networks, develop mathematical models to interpret and model these
characteristics, and discuss their various applications in practice. In
particular, 1) We show that the embeddedness distribution of social links in
many social networks has interesting and rich behavior that cannot be captured
by well-known network models. We also provide empirical results showing a clear
correlation between the embeddedness distribution and the average number of
messages communicated between pairs of social network nodes. 2) We formally
prove that random k-tree, a recent model for complex networks, has a power law
embeddedness distribution, and show empirically that the random k-tree model
can be used to capture the rich behavior of higherorder structures we observed
in real-world social networks. 3) Going beyond the embeddedness, we show that a
variant of the random k-tree model can be used to capture the power law
distribution of the size of communities of overlapping cliques discovered

run Anywhere, Anytime, Anything (3As) environments. The Bittorrent file sharing
protocol can be rarely combined with the mobility scenario framework since
resources are not available due to the dynamically changing topology network.
As a result, mobility in P2P-oriented file sharing platforms, degrades the
end-to-end efficiency and the system's performance. This work proposes a new
hybridized model, which takes into account the mobility characteristics of the
combined Bittorrent protocol in a centralized manner enabling partial mobility
characteristics, where the clients of the network use a distinct technique to
differentiate between mobile and static nodes. Many parameters were taken into
consideration like the round trip delays, the diffusion process, and the
seeding techniques, targeting the maximization of the average throughput in the
clustered swarms containing mobile peers. Partial mobility characteristics are
set in a peer-tracker and peer-peer communication enhancement schema with

  Double Perovskites","8 pages, pdflatex",,,,"cond-mat.str-el","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In addition to the well known ferromagnetism, double perovskites are also
expected to exhibit antiferromagnetic (AF) order driven by electron
delocalisation. This has been seen in model Hamiltonian studies and confirmed
via ab initio calculations. The AF phases should occur, for example, on
sufficient electron doping of materials like Sr_2FeMoO_6 (SFMO) via La
substitution for Sr. Clear experimental indication of such AF order is limited,
possibly because of increase in antisite disorder with La doping on SFMO,
although intriguing signatures of non ferromagnetic behaviour are seen. We
study the survival of electronically driven antiferromagnetism in the presence
of spatially correlated antisite disorder and extract the signals in magnetism
and transport. We discover that A and G type AF order, that is predicted in the
clean limit, is actually suppressed less strongly than ferromagnetism by
antisite disorder. The AF phases are metallic, and, remarkably, more conducting
that the ferromagnet for similar antisite disorder. We also highlight the phase
coexistence window that connects the ferromagnetic regime to the A type
antiferromagnetic phase.

are computationally universal in the sense that they can simulate, after
appropriate initialization, any quantum or classical computation, respectively.
Here we introduce a different notion of universality: a CA is called physically
universal if every transformation on any finite region can be (approximately)
implemented by the autonomous time evolution of the system after the complement
of the region has been initialized in an appropriate way. We pose the question
of whether physically universal CAs exist. Such CAs would provide a model of
the world where the boundary between a physical system and its controller can
be consistently shifted, in analogy to the Heisenberg cut for the quantum
measurement problem. We propose to study the thermodynamic cost of computation
and control within such a model because implementing a cyclic process on a
microsystem may require a non-cyclic process for its controller, whereas
implementing a cyclic process on system and controller may require the
implementation of a non-cyclic process on a ""meta""-controller, and so on.
Physically universal CAs avoid this infinite hierarchy of controllers and the
cost of implementing cycles on a subsystem can be described by mixing
properties of the CA dynamics. We define a physical prior on the CA
configurations by applying the dynamics to an initial state where half of the
CA is in the maximum entropy state and half of it is in the all-zero state
(thus reflecting the fact that life requires non-equilibrium states like the
boundary between a hold and a cold reservoir). As opposed to Solomonoff's
prior, our prior does not only account for the Kolmogorov complexity but also
for the cost of isolating the system during the state preparation if the
preparation process is not robust.

that the mixing phase from the scalar unparticle is negative, and unparticles

using molecular-dynamics simulations in three dimensions. Dynamical
heterogeneity can be characterized by three quantities: correlation length
$\xi_4$, intensity $\chi_4$, and lifetime $\tau_{\text{hetero}}$. We evaluated
all three quantities consistently from a single order parameter. In a previous
study (H. Mizuno and R. Yamamoto, Phys. Rev. E {\bf 82}, 030501(R) (2010)), we
examined the lifetime $\tau_{\text{hetero}}(t)$ in two time intervals
$t=\tau_\alpha$ and $\tau_{\text{ngp}}$, where $\tau_\alpha$ is the
$\alpha$-relaxation time and $\tau_{\text{ngp}}$ is the time at which the
non-Gaussian parameter of the Van Hove self-correlation function is maximized.
In the present study, in addition to the lifetime $\tau_{\text{hetero}}(t)$, we
evaluated the correlation length $\xi_4(t)$ and the intensity $\chi_4(t)$ from
the same order parameter used for the lifetime $\tau_{\text{hetero}}(t)$. We
found that as the temperature decreases, the lifetime $\tau_{\text{hetero}}(t)$
grows dramatically, whereas the correlation length $\xi_4(t)$ and the intensity
$\chi_4(t)$ increase slowly compared to $\tau_{\text{hetero}}(t)$ or plateaus.
Furthermore, we investigated the lifetime $\tau_{\text{hetero}}(t)$ in more
detail. We examined the time-interval dependence of the lifetime
$\tau_{\text{hetero}}(t)$ and found that as the time interval $t$ increases,
$\tau_{\text{hetero}}(t)$ monotonically becomes longer and plateaus at the
relaxation time of the two-point density correlation function. At the large
time intervals for which $\tau_{\text{hetero}}(t)$ plateaus, the heterogeneous
dynamics migrate in space with a diffusion mechanism, such as the particle
density.

provides near complete sky-map coverage with precision visible-light photometry
at 102-minute cadence. The light curves derived from these sky maps offer
unprecedented temporal resolution around, and especially before, maximum light,
a phase of the nova eruption normally not covered by ground-based observations.
They allow us to explore fundamental parameters of individual objects including
the epoch of the initial explosion, the reality and duration of any pre-maximum
halt (found in all three fast novae in our sample), the presence of secondary
maxima, speed of decline of the initial light curve, plus precise timing of the
onset of dust formation (in V1280 Sco) leading to estimation of the bolometric
luminosity, white dwarf mass and object distance. For KT Eri, Liverpool
Telescope SkyCamT data confirm important features of the SMEI light curve and
overall our results add weight to the proposed similarities of this object to
recurrent rather than to classical novae. In RS Oph, comparison with hard X-ray
data from the 2006 outburst implies that the onset of the outburst coincides
with extensive high velocity mass-loss. It is also noted that two of the four
novae we have detected (V598 Pup and KT Eri) were only discovered by
ground-based observers weeks or months after maximum light, yet these novae
reached peak magnitudes of 3.46 and 5.42 respectively. This emphasizes the fact
that many bright novae per year are still overlooked, particularly those of the
very fast speed class. Coupled with its ability to observe novae in detail even
when relatively close to the Sun in the sky, we estimate that as many as 5
novae per year may be detectable by SMEI.

continuous transformation at zero temperature. While the collective
fluctuations at quantum-critical points are being increasingly recognized as
playing an important role in a wide range of quantum materials, the nature of
the underlying quantum-critical excitations remains poorly understood. Here we
report in-depth measurements of the Hall effect in the heavy-fermion metal
YbRh2Si2, a prototypical system for quantum criticality. We isolate a rapid
crossover of the isothermal Hall coefficient clearly connected to the
quantum-critical point from a smooth background contribution; the latter exists
away from the quantum-critical point and is detectable through our studies only
over a wide range of magnetic field. Importantly, the width of the critical
crossover is proportional to temperature, which violates the predictions of
conventional theory and is instead consistent with an energy over temperature,
E/T, scaling of the quantum-critical single-electron fluctuation spectrum. Our
results provide evidence that the quantum-dynamical scaling and a critical
Kondo breakdown simultaneously operate in the same material. Correspondingly,
we infer that macroscopic scale-invariant fluctuations emerge from the
microscopic many-body excitations associated with a collapsing Fermi-surface.
This insight is expected to be relevant to the unconventional
finite-temperature behavior in a broad range of strongly correlated quantum
systems.

now complete the proof of the consistency of QLRA to cover hyperbolic

The problem of consistency of QLRA arises, because formally the output of QLRA
depends on the order of conditioning. For two observables (e.g., physical or
biological) a and b, b|a- and a|b- conditional probabilities produce two
representations, say in Hilbert spaces H^{b| a} and H^{a|b} (in this paper over

surface convection simulations of red giants to explore the impact of
granulation on interferometric observables. Methods. We compute intensity maps
for the 3D simulation snapshots in two filters: in the optical at 5000 \pm 300
{\AA} and in the K band 2.14 $\pm$ 0.26 {\mu}m FLUOR filter, corresponding to
the wavelength-range of instruments mounted on the CHARA interferometer. From
the intensity maps, we construct images of the stellar disks, accounting for
center-to-limb variations. We then derive interferometric visibility amplitudes
and phases. We study their behavior with position angle and wavelength.
Results. We provide average limb-darkening coefficients for different
metallicities and wavelength-ranges. We detail the prospects for the detection
and characterization of granulation and center-to-limb variations of red giant
stars with today's interferometers. We find that the effect of
convective-related surface structures depends on metallicity and surface
gravity. We provided theoretical closure phases that should be incorporated

estimate 3D-1D corrections to stellar radii determination: 3D models are ~ 3.5%
smaller to ~ 1% larger in the optical with respect to 1D, and roughly 0.5 to
1.5% smaller in the infrared. Even if these corrections are small, they are
important to properly set the zero point of effective temperature scale derived

calibration. On board of Gaia there will be two (spectro)photometers, the blue
one (BP) and the red one (RP) covering the range 330-1050 nm, and the white
light (G-band) imager dedicated to astrometry. Given the fact that the focal
plane of Gaia will be constituted by 105 CCDs and the sources will cross the
the focal plane at constant speed, at different positions in each of the
foreseen passages (on average 70--80, but up to 350) in the mission lifetime,
the ``simple"" problem of calibrating the integrated BP/RP and G-band magnitudes
and the low resolution BP/RP spectra flux turns into a very delicate and
complicated issue, including CTI effects, LSF variations across the focal plane
and with time, CCD gating to avoid saturation and the like. The calibration
model requires a carefully selected set of $\simeq$200 SpectroPhotometric
Standard Stars (SPSS) with a nominal precision of a few \%, with respect to
Vega.

molecule between two conductance states is studied by low-temperature scanning
tunneling microscopy for the first time, and is found to be dependent on the
tip-substrate distance and the applied bias. Using a minimal model Hamiltonian
approach combined with density-functional calculations, the switching is shown
to be related to the scattering of electrons tunneling through the junction,
which progressively excite the relevant chemical bond. Depending on the
direction in which the molecule switches, different molecular orbitals are
shown to dominate the transport and thus the vibrational heating process. This
in turn can dramatically affect the switching rate, leading to non-monotonic
behavior with respect to bias under certain conditions. In this work, rather
than simply assuming a constant density of states as in previous works, it was
modeled by Lorentzians. This allows for the successful description of this
non-monotonic behavior of the switching rate, thus demonstrating the importance
of modeling the density of states realistically.

elliptical streaming associated with the spiral structure of the HI disc and
the central bar-like feature in the mass distribution, (2) a spherical dark

radial flows in the HI velocity field. The radial outflows are inconsistent
with the plausible disc formation scenario in which gas from the surrounding

Building on a totally asymmetric exclusion process (TASEP) to characterize the
motion of the interacting cargoes, we allow for mass exchange with the
environment, input and output at filament boundaries and focus on the role of
interconversion rates and how they affect the directionality of the net cargo
transport. We quantify the effect of the various different competing processes
in terms of non-equilibrium phase diagrams. The interplay of interconversion
rates, which allow for flux reversal and evaporation/deposition processes
introduce qualitatively new features in the phase diagrams. We observe regimes
of three-phase coexistence, the possibility of phase re-entrance and a
significant flexibility in how the different phase boundaries shift in response
to changes in control parameters. The moving steady state solutions of this
model allows for different possibilities for the spatial distribution of cargo
vesicles, ranging from homogeneous distribution of vesicles to polarized
distributions, characterized by inhomogeneities or {\it shocks}. Current
reversals due to internal regulation emerge naturally within the framework of
this model. We believe this minimal model will clarify the understanding of
many features of collective vesicle transport, apart from serving as the basis
for building more exact quantitative models for vesicle transport relevant to

relation provides a new complimentary tool that can be employed to study
light-induced charge transport models and facilitate experimental data
analysis. It is shown that the origin of the coherent current and the
dc-polarisation induced in a noncentrosymmetric crystal under illumination is
related to the theory of the Berry phase and can be represented in terms of the
renormalised geometric potentials. This renormalisation originates from the
extra phase difference acquired by a carrier in the light field on the quantum
transition between the electronic bands. The gauge invariance of the
corresponding expressions for the current and the polarisation is demonstrated.

emerging from triple degenerated species as from a paraelectric cubic phase

distance information, the luminosities for young RMS sources with far-infrared
fluxes. Methods: We use a model spectral energy distribution (SED) fitter to
obtain the bolometric flux for our sources, given flux data from our work and
the literature. The inputs to the model fitter were optimised by a series of
investigations designed to reveal the effect varying these inputs had on the
resulting bolometric flux. Kinematic distances derived from molecular line
observations were then used to calculate the luminosity of each source.
Results: Bolometric fluxes are obtained for 1173 young RMS sources, of which
1069 have uniquely constrained kinematic distances and good SED fits. A
comparison of the bolometric fluxes obtained using SED fitting with trapezium
rule integration and two component greybody fits was also undertaken, and
showed that both produce considerable scatter compared to the method used here.
Conclusions: The bolometric flux results allowed us to obtain the luminosity
distributions of YSOs and UC\HII{} regions in the RMS sample, which we find to
be different. We also find that there are few MYSOs with L $\geq$

spectrum of \zeta and the non-linearity parameter fNL have an angular
modulation. This formalism is applied for two vector curvaton models and the

water'. Water itself (without ions) is lethal to animal cells and damaging for

to sustain life. Physical chemistry is the language of electrolyte solutions.
Physical chemistry and biology are intertwined. Physical chemists and
biologists come from different traditions that separated for several decades as
biologists described the molecules of life. Communication is not easy between a
fundamentally descriptive tradition and a fundamentally analytical one.
Biologists have now learned to study well defined systems with physical
techniques, of considerable interest to physical chemists. Physical chemists
are increasingly interested in spatially inhomogeneous systems with structures
on the atomic scale so common in biology. Physical chemists will find it
productive to work on well defined systems built by evolution to be reasonably
robust, with input output relations insensitive to environmental insults. This
article deals with properties of ion channels that in my view can be dealt with
by 'physics as usual', with much the same tools that physical chemists apply to
other systems. Indeed, I introduce and use a tool of physicists-a field theory
(and boundary conditions) based on an energy variational approach developed by
Chun Liu-not too widely used among physical chemists. My goal is to provide the
knowledge base, and identify the assumptions, that biologists use in studying
ion channels, avoiding jargon. Rather simple models of selectivity and
permeation in ion channels work quite well in important cases. Those physical
models and cases are the main focus of this review because they demonstrate the
strong essential link between the traditional treatments of ions in chemical
physics, and the biological function of ion channels.

better when the correction provided by adaptive optics becomes poor, by a
factor of 2 and more when the Strehl ratio is lower than 10%. In low light
level cases (detector noise regime), multimode interferometry reaches better
performance, yet the gain never exceeds 20%, which corresponds to the
percentage of photon loss due to the injection in the guides. Besides, we
demonstrate that single-mode interferometry is also more robust to the

spacetime, based on the recognition that such theories should be diffeomorphism
invariant. These theorems, which are in fact generalized Noether theorems, have
several nontrivial ramifications. One immediate consequence is the necessity to
re-evaluate some of the default characterizations of the original Noether
theorems as general statements - for instance, the statement that every global
invariance of the action gives rise to a conserved current. As it turns out,
this latter statement remains valid, but apparently only as a consequence of
both the generalized first and second Noether theorem (at any rate, it is very
far from clear how to avoid such a conclusion). A ramification of a more
constructive nature consists in a novel expression for the so-called Belinfante
stress-energy tensor, for which it is evident that it generalizes to the
correct stress-energy tensor within the context of general relativity. The
crucial symmetry property here is diffeomorphism invariance, rather than
Poincar\'e invariance. Using this new form for the stress-energy tensor, an
alternative route to general relativity also becomes available, which, in
contrast to many standard treatments, is intrinsically based on a variational
formulation - i.e. without the need to have prior knowledge of the form of
Einstein's equation. The connection of these results to related results
previously established in the literature (although in a completely different

approaches such as the quasiparticle GW method. In ZnO the valence bands are
narrowed and the band gap is increased to a value in much better agreement with
experiment. The Zn $d$ states do not move to higher binding energy as they do
in LDA+U calculations. The functional is effective for systems with hydride
anions, where correcting self-interaction errors in the 1$s$ state is
important. Similarly, it correctly opens semiconducting gaps in the alkaline
earth hexaborides.It correctly stabilizes an antiferromagnetic insulating
ground state for the undoped cuprate parent CaCuO$_2$, but seriously degrades
the agreement with experiment for ferromagnetic Gd relative to the standard
local spin density approximation and generalized gradient approximations. This
is due to positioning of the minority spin $4f$ states at too low an energy.
Conversly, the position of the La $4f$ conduction bands of La$_2$O$_3$ is in
reasonable accord with experiment as it is with standard functionals. The

to very general asymptotic properties of the survival probability. The observed

density. We expand the energy per particle (E/A) of symmetric infinite nuclear
matter in powers of the density to take into account 2,3,. . .,N-body forces.
New EOS are proposed by fitting ground state properties of nuclear matter
(binding energy, compressibility and pressure) and assuming that at high
densities a second order phase transition to the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP)
occurs. The latter phase transition is due to symmetry breaking at high density
from nuclear matter (locally color white) to the QGP (globally color white). In
the simplest implementation of a second order phase transition we calculate the
critical exponent ? by using Landau's theory of phase transition. We find ? =
3. Refining the properties of the EOS near the critical point gives ? = 5 in
agreement with experimental results. We also discuss some scenarios for the EOS
at finite temperatures.

  streaming using an interactive middleware support system","IEEE Systems Journal 2010",,"10.1109/JSYST.2010.2047172",,"cs.DC cs.MM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/","  While sharing resources the efficiency is substantially degraded as a result
of the scarceness of availability of the requested resources in a multiclient
support manner. These resources are often aggravated by many factors like the
temporal constraints for availability or node flooding by the requested
replicated file chunks. Thus replicated file chunks should be efficiently
disseminated in order to enable resource availability on-demand by the mobile
users. This work considers a cross layered middleware support system for
efficient delay-sensitive streaming by using each device's connectivity and
social interactions in a cross layered manner. The collaborative streaming is
achieved through the epidemically replicated file chunk policy which uses a
transition-based approach of a chained model of an infectious disease with
susceptible, infected, recovered and death states. The Gossip-based stateful
model enforces the mobile nodes whether to host a file chunk or not or, when no
longer a chunk is needed, to purge it. The proposed model is thoroughly
evaluated through experimental simulation taking measures for the effective
throughput Eff as a function of the packet loss parameter in contrast with the
effectiveness of the replication Gossip-based policy.

parameterization of software defined radio (SDR) architecture. Parameterization
decreases the size of the software to be downloaded and also limits the
hardware reconfiguration time. The present paper is based on the design and
development of a programmable baseband modulator that perform the QPSK
modulation schemes and as well as its other three commonly used variants to
satisfy the requirement of several established 2G and 3G wireless communication
standards. The proposed design has been shown to be capable of operating at a
maximum data rate of 77 Mbps on Xilinx Virtex 2-Pro University field
programmable gate array (FPGA) board. The pulse shaping root raised cosine
(RRC) filter has been implemented using distributed arithmetic (DA) technique
in the present work in order to reduce the computational complexity, and to
achieve appropriate power reduction and enhanced throughput. The designed
multiplier-less programmable 32-tap FIR-based RRC filter has been found to
withstand a peak inter-symbol interference (ISI) distortion of -41 dBs
