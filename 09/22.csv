clouds, and evolved stars, carried out using the Caltech Submillimeter
Observatory. Fourteen sources in the sample are also observed in the

clear detections in all but four of the targets, often in emission. Absorptions
against bright background continuum sources are also seen in nine cases,
usually involving a delicate balance between emission and absorption features.
From RADEX modeling, we derive gas densities and HCl column densities for
sources with HCl emission. HCl is found in a wide range of environments, with
gas densities ranging from $10^5$ to $10^7$~cm$^{-3}$. The HCl abundance
relative to H$_2$ is in the range of $(3-30)\times10^{-10}$. Comparing with the
chlorine abundance in the solar neighborhood, this corresponds to a chlorine
depletion factor of up to $\sim$400, assuming that HCl accounts for one third
of the total chlorine in the gas phase. The [\tfcl]/[\tscl] isotopic ratio is
rather varied, from unity to $\sim$5, mostly lower than the terrestrial value
of 3.1. Such variation is highly localized, and could be generated by the
nucleosynthesis in supernovae, which predicts a \tscl\ deficiency in most
models. The lower ratios seen in W3IRS4 and W3IRS5 likely confine the
progenitors of the supernovae to stars with relatively large mass
($\ga$25M$_\sun$) and high metallicity (Z$\sim$0.02).

orbital plane of a transiting exoplanet and the spin of its host star was a
good discriminator between different migration processes for hot-Jupiters.
Specifically, well-aligned hot-Jupiter systems (as measured by the
Rossiter-McLaughlin effect) were thought to have formed via migration through
interaction with a viscous disk, while misaligned systems were thought to have
undergone a more violent dynamical history. These conclusions were based on the
assumption that the planet-forming disk was well-aligned with the host star.
Recent work by a number of authors has challenged this assumption by proposing
mechanisms that act to drive the star-disk interaction out of alignment during
the pre-main sequence phase. We have estimated the stellar rotation axis of a
sample of stars which host spatially resolved debris disks. Comparison of our
derived stellar rotation axis inclination angles with the geometrically

the fair price of an insurance contract. In a lot of European countries for
instance the prices for motor car insurance depend on the number of claims the
driver has reported to the insurance company during the last years. Classically
these prices are calculated on the basis of a mixed Poisson model with a gamma
mixing distribution. The mixing distribution models the car drivers' qualities
across the insured portfolio. This is just one example for experience rating.
In the classical context the price is equal to the expectation of the Bayesian
posterior distribution.
  In some lines of business (especially third party liability and lines with
exposure to extreme weather events) we that the real world data cannot be
described well enough by the classical Poisson - gamma model. Therefore we
investigate the influence of the mixing distribution on the posterior
distribution conditional on the experienced number of claims. This enables the
application of other - more risk adequate premium principles than the
expectation principle. We introduce the inverse - gamma distribution as a new
mixing distribution to model claim numbers and compare it to the classical
gamma distribution. In both cases a closed analytic representation of the mixed
distribution can be found: In the classic case the well known negative binomial
distribution, in our new one a representation using the Bessel functions.
Additionally we present numerical results about the tail behaviour of the mixed
Poisson - inverse - gamma distribution. Finally we introduce the concept of
resolution. It enables us to decide if the classification of risk groups via
the number of experienced claims is a risk adequate procedure.

modelling of the risk processes relevant for its business. Every insurance
company should be capable of running a holistic risk management process to meet
this challenge. For property and casualty (P&C) insurance companies the risk
adequate modelling of the claim reserves is a very important topic as this
liabilities determine up to 70% percent of the balance sum. We propose a three
dimensional (3D) stochastic model for claim reserving. It delivers consistently
the reserve's distribution function as well as the distributions of all parts
of it that are needed for accounting and controlling. The calibration methods
for the model are well known from data analysis and they are applicable in an
practitioner environment. We evaluate the model numerically by the help of
Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. Classical actuarial reserve models are two
dimensional (2D). They lead to an estimation algorithm that is applied on a 2D
matrix, the run off triangle. Those methods (for instance the Chain - Ladder or
the Bornhuetter - Ferguson method) are widely used in practice nowadays and
give rise to several problems: They estimate the reserves' expectation and some
of them - under very restriction assumptions - the variance. They provide no
information about the tail of the reserve's distribution, what would be most
important for risk calculation, for assessing the insurance company's financial
stability and economic situation. Additionally, due to the projection of the
claim process into a two dimensional space the results are very often distorted
and dependent on the kind of projection. Therefore we extend the classical 2D
models to a 3D space because we find inconsistencies generated by inadequate
projections into the 2D spaces.

locally isothermal disk, with moderate turbulent viscosity (~0.0005 < alpha <
~0.05), based on three-dimensional nonlinear hydrodynamical simulations. The
radial gradients (in a dimensionless logarithmic form) of density and
temperature are assumed to be constant near the planet. We find that the torque
is roughly equally sensitive to the surface density and temperature radial
gradients. Both gradients contribute to inward migration when they are
negative. Our results indicate that two-dimensional calculations with a
smoothed planet potential, used to account for the effects of the third
dimension, do not accurately determine the effects of density and temperature
gradients on the three-dimensional torque. The results suggest that
substantially slowing or stopping planet migration by means of changes in disk
opacity or shadowing is difficult and appears unlikely for a disk that is
locally isothermal. The scalings of the torque and torque density with planet
mass and gas sound speed follow the expectations of linear theory. We also
determine an improved formula for the torque density distribution that can be
used in one-dimensional long-term evolution studies of planets embedded in
locally isothermal disks. This formula can be also applied in the presence of
mildly varying radial gradients and of planets that open gaps. We illustrate
its use in the case of migrating super-Earths and determine some conditions

operation at the Thermopylae Satellite Communication Station since 1996. The
observations extend from the base of the Solar Corona (650 MHz) to about 2
Solar Radii (20 MHz) with time resolution 1/10-1/100 sec. The instruments
recordings, being in the form of dynamic spectra, measure radio flux as a
function of height in the corona; our observations are combined with spatial
data from the Nancay Radioheliograph whenever the need for 3D positional
information arises. The ARTEMIS-IV contribution in the study of solar radio
bursts is two fold- Firstly, in investigating new spectral characteristics
since its high sampling rate facilitates the study of fine structures in radio
events. On the other hand it is used in studying the association of solar
bursts with interplanetary phenomena because of its extended frequency range
which is, furthermore, complementary to the range of the WIND/WAVES receivers
and the observations may be readily combined. This reports serves as a brief
account of this operation. Joint observations with STEREO/WAVES and LOFAR low
frequency receivers are envisaged in the future.

polynomial ring $P = K[X\times N^*]$ and by the monoid $\Sigma = < \sigma >$

of polynomials in a countable set of commuting variables, we present also a
general Gr\""obner bases theory for graded two-sided ideals of the graded
algebra $S = \bigoplus_i S_i$ with $S_i = P \sigma^i$ and $\sigma:P \to P$ an
abstract endomorphism satisfying compatibility conditions with ordering and
divisibility of the monomials of $P$. Moreover, using a suitable grading for
the algebra $P$ compatible with the action of $\Sigma$, we obtain a bijective
correspondence, preserving Gr\""obner bases, between graded $\Sigma$-invariant
ideals of $P$ and a class of graded two-sided ideals of $S$. By means of the
embedding $\iota$ this results in the unification, in the graded case, of the
Gr\""obner bases theories for commutative and non-commutative polynomial rings.
Finally, since the ring of ordinary difference polynomials $P = K[X\times N]$
fits the proposed theory one obtains that, with respect to a suitable grading,
the Gr\""obner bases of finitely generated graded ordinary difference ideals can
be computed also in the operators ring $S$ and in a finite number of steps up

maximization problems where the objective is a function of the sequence of

introduce the concepts of \emph{sequence-submodularity} and
\emph{sequence-monotonicity} which extend the notions of submodularity and
monotonicity from functions defined over sets to functions defined over
sequences. We establish that if the objective function is sequence-submodular

$1-1/e$ of the optimal solution. We apply our algorithm and analysis to two
applications in online advertising: online ad allocation and query rewriting.
We first show that both problems can be formulated as maximizing non-decreasing
sequence-submodular functions. We then apply our framework to these two
problems, leading to simple greedy approaches with guaranteed performances. In
particular, for online ad allocation problem the performance of our algorithm
is $1-1/e$, which matches the best known existing performance, and for query
rewriting problem the performance of our algorithm is $1- 1/e^{1-1/e}$ which
improves upon the best known existing performance in the literature.

states generate a source of internal fluctuations in a neuron, known as channel
noise. The standard method for modeling fluctuations in the states of ion
channels uses continuous-time Markov chains nonlinearly coupled to a
differential equation for voltage. Beginning with the work of Fox and Lu, there
have been attempts to generate simpler models that use stochastic differential
equation (SDEs) to approximate the stochastic spiking activity produced by
Markov chain models. Recent numerical investigations, however, have raised
doubts that SDE models can preserve the stochastic dynamics of Markov chain
models.
  We analyze three SDE models that have been proposed as approximations to the
Markov chain model: one that describes the states of the ion channels and two
that describe the states of the ion channel subunits. We show that the former
channel-based approach can capture the distribution of channel noise and its
effect on spiking in a Hodgkin-Huxley neuron model to a degree not previously
demonstrated, but the latter two subunit-based approaches cannot. Our analysis
provides intuitive and mathematical explanations for why this is the case: the
temporal correlation in the channel noise is determined by the combinatorics of
bundling subunits into channels, and the subunit-based approaches do not
correctly account for this structure. Our study therefore confirms and
elucidates the findings of previous numerical investigations of subunit-based
SDE models. Moreover, it presents the first evidence that Markov chain models
of the nonlinear, stochastic dynamics of neural membranes can be accurately
approximated by SDEs. This finding opens a door to future modeling work using
SDE techniques to further illuminate the effects of ion channel fluctuations on
electrically active cells.

deduced by R. L. Kurucz and D. F. Gray. Additionally, we present a fitting
formula for the wave energy flux based on the governing stellar and magnetic

numerically account for the wave energies generated at the base of magnetic
flux tubes. Results. The results indicate a stiff dependence of the generated
wave energy on the stellar and magnetic parameters in principal agreement with
previous studies. The wave energy flux F_LTW decreases by about a factor of 1.7
between G0V and K0V stars, but drops by almost two orders of magnitude between
K0V and M0V stars. In addition, the values for F_LTW are significantly higher

the findings from previous studies. Conclusions. Our study will add to the
description of magnetic energy generation in late-type main-sequence stars. Our
results will be helpful for calculating theoretical atmospheric models for

geometric property. Indeed, the fundamental group of a 3-manifold is
left-orderable whenever the first Betti number is positive; in the case that
the first Betti number is zero this property is closely tied to the existence
of certain nice foliations. As a result, many large classes of 3-manifolds,
including knot complements, are known to have left-orderable fundamental group.
However, though the complement of a knot has left-orderable fundamental group,
the result of Dehn surgery is a closed 3-manifold that need not have this
property. We take this as motivation for the study of left-orderability in the
context of Dehn surgery, and establish a condition on peripheral elements that
must hold whenever a given Dehn surgery yields a manifold with left-orderable
fundamental group. This leads to a workable criterion used to determine when
sufficiently positive Dehn surgery produces manifolds with non-left-orderable
fundamental group. As examples we produce infinite families of hyperbolic knots
-- subsuming the (-2,3,q)-pretzel knots -- for which sufficiently positive
surgery always produces a manifold with non-left-orderable fundamental group.
Our examples are consistent with the observation that many (indeed, all known)
examples of L-spaces have non-left-orderable fundamental group, as the given
families of knots are hyperbolic L-space knots. Moreover, the behaviour of the
examples studied here is consistent with the property that sufficiently
positive surgery on an L-space knot always yields an L-space.

achieve this, we follow a RG strategy similar to that proposed by Vojta
\emph{et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{85}, 4940 (2000)], which consists of
defining a soft ultraviolet regulator in the space of Matsubara frequencies for
the renormalized Green's function. Then we proceed to derive analytically and
solve numerically integro-differential flow equations for the effective
couplings and the quasiparticle weight of the present model, which fully treat
the interplay of particle-particle and particle-hole parquet diagrams and the
effect of the two-loop self-energy feedback into them. We show that our results
correctly reproduce accurate numerical renormalization group data for weak to
slightly moderate interactions. These results are in excellent agreement with
other functional Wilsonian RG works available in the literature. Since the
field-theoretical RG method turns out to be easier to implement at higher loops
than the Wilsonian approach, higher-order calculations within the present
approach could improve further the results for this model at stronger
couplings. We argue that the present RG scheme could thus offer a possible
alternative to other functional RG methods to describe electronic correlations
within this model.

installed at water depths between 2050 and 2300 m, employ piezo-electric
elements for the broad-band recording of signals with frequencies ranging up to
125 kHz. The typical sensitivity of the sensors is around -145 dB re 1V/muPa
(including preamplifier). Completed in May 2008, AMADEUS consists of six
""acoustic clusters"", each comprising six acoustic sensors that are arranged at
distances of roughly 1 m from each other. Two vertical mechanical structures
(so-called lines) of the ANTARES detector host three acoustic clusters each.
Spacings between the clusters range from 14.5 to 340 m. Each cluster contains
custom-designed electronics boards to amplify and digitise the acoustic signals
from the sensors. An on-shore computer cluster is used to process and filter
the data stream and store the selected events. The daily volume of recorded
data is about 10 GB. The system is operating continuously and automatically,
requiring only little human intervention. AMADEUS allows for extensive studies
of both transient signals and ambient noise in the deep sea, as well as signal
correlations on several length scales and localisation of acoustic point
sources. Thus the system is excellently suited to assess the background
conditions for the measurement of the bipolar pulses expected to originate from
neutrino interactions.

densities have been determined: log(N(HD),A)=15.70+/-0.07 for z_A=2.626443(2)

for z_D=1.77670(3) in the spectrum of Q1331+170. The measured HD/H2 ratio for
three of these subsystems has been found to be considerably higher than its
values typical of clouds in our Galaxy. We discuss the problem of determining
the primordial deuterium abundance, which is most sensitive to the baryon
density of the Universe \Omega_{b}. Using a well-known model for the chemistry
of a molecular cloud, we have estimated the isotopic ratio
D/H=HD/2H_2=(2.97+/-0.55)x10^{-5} and the corresponding baryon density
\Omega_{b}h^2=0.0205^{+0.0025}_{-0.0020}. This value is in good agreement with
\Omega_{b}h^2=0.0226^{+0.0006}_{-0.0006} obtained by analyzing the cosmic
microwave background radiation anisotropy. However, in high-redshift clouds,
under conditions of low metallicity and low dust content, hydrogen may be
incompletely molecularized even in the case of self-shielding. In this
situation, the HD/2H_2 ratio may not correspond to the actual D/H isotopic
ratio. We have estimated the cloud molecularization dynamics and the influence
of cosmological evolutionary effects on it.

Sporadic dynamical perturbation processes are ignored, such as passing stars,

field on the cometary motion and how it changes in time. We use a model of the
Galaxy with a disc, bulge and dark halo, and a local disc density, and disc

By integrating a few million of cometary orbits over 1 Gyr, we calculate the
time variable flux of Oort cloud comets that enter the inner Solar System, for
the cases of a constant Galactic tidal field, and a realistically varying tidal
field which is a function of the Sun's orbit. The applied method calculates the
evolution of the comets by using first-order averaged mean elements. We find
that the periodicity in the cometary flux is complicated and quasi-periodic.
The amplitude of the variations in the flux are of order 30%. The radial motion
of the Sun is the chief cause of this behaviour, and should be taken into
account when the Galactic influence on the Oort cloud comets is studied.

orientations are anisotropic: a galaxy's long axis tends to be oriented toward
the center of its host. This radial alignment is seen across a wide range of
scales, from galaxies in massive clusters to small Milky Way type satellite
systems. Recently, this effect has also been detected in dark matter
simulations of cosmological structure, but the degree of alignment of dark
matter substructures in these studies is significantly stronger than seen in
observations. In this paper we attempt to reconcile these two results by
performing high-resolution numerical experiments on N-body multi-component
models of triaxial galaxies orbiting in an external analytical potential. The
large number of particles employed allows us to probe deep into the inner
structure of the galaxy: we show that the discrepancy between observed galaxies
and simulated dark matter halos is a natural consequence of induced radial
shape twisting in the galaxy by the external potential. The degree of twisting
depends strongly on the orbital phase and eccentricity of the satellite, and it
can, under certain conditions, be significant at radii smaller than the dark
matter scale radius. Such internal misalignments will have important
consequences, both for the dynamical evolution of the galaxy itself, and for
mass modeling of galaxies in clustered environments.

eccentric orbits. The high eccentricities are not easily explained by
planet-formation models, which predict that planets should be on rather
circular orbits. Here we explore whether fly-bys involving planetary systems
with properties similar to those of the gas giants in the solar system, can
produce planets with properties similar to the observed planets. Using
numerical simulations, we show that fly-bys can cause the immediate ejection of
planets, and sometimes also lead to the capture of one or more planets by the
intruder. More common, however, is that fly-bys only perturb the orbits of
planets, sometimes leaving the system in an unstable state. Over time-scales of
a few million to several hundred million years after the fly-by, this
perturbation can trigger planet-planet scatterings, leading to the ejection of
one or more planets. For example, in the case of the four gas giants of the
solar system, the fraction of systems from which at least one planet is ejected
more than doubles in 10^8 years after the fly-by. The remaining planets are
often left on more eccentric orbits, similar to the eccentricities of the
observed extrasolar planets. We combine our results of how fly-bys effect
solar-system-like planetary systems, with the rate at which encounters in young
stellar clusters occur. For example, we measure the effects of fly-bys on the
four gas giants in the solar system. We find, that for such systems, between 5
and 15 per cent suffer ejections of planets in 10^8 years after fly-bys in
typical open clusters. Thus, encounters in young stellar clusters can
significantly alter the properties of any planets orbiting stars in clusters.
As a large fraction of stars which populate the solar neighbourhood form in
stellar clusters, encounters can significantly affect the properties of the

  figures, 3 tables",,"10.1088/2041-8205/722/2/L209",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Velocity dispersion measurements of recently discovered Milky Way satellites
with $M_V\gtrsim-7$ imply they posses high mass-to-light ratios. The expected
velocity dispersions due to their baryonic mass are $\sim0.2$\,km\,s$^{-1}$,
but values $\gtrsim3$\,km\,s$^{-1}$ are measured. We perform Monte Carlo
simulations of mock radial velocity measurements of these systems assuming they
have mass-to-light ratios similar to globular clusters and posses an
unidentified binary star population, to determine if these stars could boost
the velocity dispersion to the observed values. We find that this hypothesis is
unlikely to produce dispersions much in excess of $\sim 4.5$\,km\,s$^{-1}$, in
agreement with previous work. However, for the systems with potentially the
smallest velocity dispersions, values consistent with observations are produced
in 5-40% of our simulations for binary fractions in excess of
$f_{bin}(P\le10$\,yrs$)\sim5%$. This sample includes the dwarf galaxy
candidates that lie closest to classical globular clusters in $M_V-r_h$ space.
Considered as a population, it is unlikely that all of these dwarf galaxy
candidates have mass-to-light ratios typical of globular clusters, but boosting
of the observed dispersion by binaries from near-zero values cannot be ruled
out at high confidence for several individual dwarf galaxy candidates. Given
the importance of obtaining accurate velocity dispersions and dynamical masses
for the faintest satellites, it is clearly desirable to exclude directly the
possible effect of binaries on these systems. This requires multi-epoch radial
velocity measurements with individual uncertainties of
$\lesssim$1\,km\,s$^{-1}$ to identify spectroscopic binaries with orbital
velocities of order the observed velocity dispersion.

moderately metal-rich ([Fe/H] ~ -1.3) Galactic globular cluster (GC) M62 (NGC
6266). The present dataset is the largest obtained so far for this cluster, and
consists of 168 images per filter, obtained with the Warsaw 1.3m telescope at
the Las Campanas Observatory (LCO) and the 1.3m telescope of the Cerro Tololo
Inter-American Observatory (CTIO), in two separate runs over the time span of
three months. The procedure adopted to detect the variable stars was the
optimal image subtraction method (ISIS v2.2), as implemented by Alard. The
photometry was performed using both ISIS and DAOPHOT/ALLFRAME. We have
identified 245 variable stars in the cluster fields that have been analyzed so
far, of which 179 are new discoveries. Of these variables, 133 are fundamental
mode RR Lyrae stars (RRab), 76 are first overtone (RRc) pulsators, 4 are type
II Cepheids, 25 are long-period variables (LPV), 1 is an eclipsing binary, and
6 are not yet well classified. Such a large number of RR Lyrae stars places M62
among the top two most RR Lyrae-rich (in the sense of total number of RR Lyrae
stars present) GCs known in the Galaxy, second only to M3 (NGC 5272) with a
total of 230 known RR Lyrae stars. Since this study covers most but not all of
the cluster area, it is not unlikely that M62 is in fact the most RR Lyrae-rich
GC in the Galaxy. In like vein, we were also able to detect the largest sample
of LPV's known in a Galactic GC. We analyze a variety of Oosterhoff type
indicators for the cluster, and conclude that M62 is an Oosterhoff type I
system. This is in good agreement with the moderately high metallicity of the
cluster, in spite of its predominantly blue horizontal branch morphology --
which is more typical of Oosterhoff type II systems. We thus conclude that
metallicity plays a key role in defining Oosterhoff type. [abridged]

The L[CII] /LFIR ratio in our star-formation-dominated systems is ~8 times

star-formation-dominated systems. Furthermore, the L[CII]/LFIR and
L[CII]/L(CO(1-0)) ratios in our starforming galaxies and nearby starburst
galaxies are the same, so that luminous starforming galaxies at earlier epochs
(z~1-2) appear to be scaled up versions of local starbursts entailing
kilo-parsec-scale starbursts. Most of the FIR and [CII] radiation from our
AGN-dominated sample (excepting PKS 0215+015) also arises from kpc scale
starformation, but with far-UV radiation fields ~8 times more intense than in
our star-formation-dominated sample. We speculate that the onset of AGN
activity stimulates large-scale star-formation activity within AGN-dominated
systems. This idea is supported by the relatively strong [OIII] line emission,
indicating very young stars, that was recently observed in high z composite
AGN/starburst systems. Our results confirm the utility of the [CII] line, and

important to understand the processes of how this energy and material is
released as planets are destroyed. It is not known how fast the large amounts
of energy and material are released, making it difficult to predict how
observable planet destruction will be. There is a huge amount of energy made
available by falling deep into the star's potential well: Simple calculations
show that many of the currently known ""hot Jupiters"" can potentially produce
events as luminous as a small nova if the energy is released fast enough. To
observe these events, the important questions are how will this energy be
released, and whether the energy will be released rapidly enough to create an
event luminous enough to be found by transient surveys.
  Alternatively, if planet destruction is slowed by the inward migration
alternating with periods of outward migration caused by Roche lobe overflow
(RLOF), then the primary signature may be the effects of the release of large
amounts of gas. The infall of this gas also may significantly contribute to the
system's luminosity. The release of planetary gas may be a searchable signature
of planet destruction. Signs of runaway RLOF and outward or alternating RLOF
should be searched for.

nanopillars and diamond nanowires. The first device consists of a 'shallow'

the devices contain a single NV center. The second device demonstrates 'deep'
(~1\mu m) implantation of individual NV centers into pre-fabricated diamond
nanowire. The high single photon flux of the nanowire geometry, combined with
the low background fluorescence of the ultrapure diamond, allows us to sustain
strong photon anti-bunching even at high pump powers.

special symmetry conditions, which can be achieved by tuning gate voltages,

leads to a remarkable one-parameter description of nonperturbative hadron
dynamics. The model predicts a zero-mass pion for zero-mass quarks and a Regge
spectrum of linear trajectories with the same slope in the leading orbital
angular momentum $L$ of hadrons and the radial quantum number $N$. Light-Front
Holography maps the amplitudes which are functions of the fifth dimension
variable $z$ of anti-de Sitter space to a corresponding hadron theory quantized
on the light front. The resulting Lorentz-invariant relativistic light-front
wave equations are functions of an invariant impact variable $\zeta$ which
measures the separation of the quark and gluonic constituents within the hadron
at equal light-front time. The result is a semi-classical frame-independent
first approximation to the spectra and light-front wavefunctions of meson and
baryon light-quark bound states, which in turn predict the behavior of the pion
and nucleon form factors. The effects of chiral symmetry breaking increase as
one goes toward large interquark separation, consistent with spectroscopic
data, and the hadron eigenstates generally have components with different
orbital angular momentum; e.g., the proton eigenstate in AdS/QCD with massless
quarks has L=0 and L=1 light-front Fock components with equal probability. The
soft-wall model also predicts the form of the non-perturbative effective
coupling $\alpha_s^{AdS}(Q)$ which agrees with the effective coupling extracted
from the Bjorken sum rule. The AdS/QCD model can be systematically improved by
using its complete orthonormal solutions to diagonalize the full QCD
light-front Hamiltonian or by applying the Lippmann-Schwinger method in order
to systematically include the QCD interaction terms. A new perspective on quark
and gluon condensates is also reviewed.

lamellae interleaved with amorphous regions. As a result, crystalline polymers
are full of crystal-melt interfaces, which dominate their physical properties.
The longstanding theoretical challenge to understand these interfaces has new
relevance, because of accumulating evidence that polymer crystals often
nucleate via a metastable, partially ordered ""rotator"" phase. To test this idea
requires a theory of the bulk and interfacial free energies of the critical
nucleus. We present a new approach to the crystal-melt interface, which
represents the amorphous region as a grafted brush of loops in a
self-consistent pressure field. We combine this theory with estimates of bulk
free energy differences, to calculate nucleation barriers and rates via rotator
versus crystal nuclei for polyethylene. We find rotator-phase nucleation is
indeed favored throughout the temperature range where nucleation is observed.
Our methods can be extended to other polymers.

low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes over the Binary Erasure Channel (BEC).
The TEP decoder is derived applying the expectation propagation (EP) algorithm
with a tree- structured approximation. Expectation Propagation (EP) is a
generalization to Belief Propagation (BP) in two ways. First, it can be used
with any exponential family distribution over the cliques in the graph. Second,
it can impose additional constraints on the marginal distributions. We use this
second property to impose pair-wise marginal constraints in some check nodes of
the LDPC code's Tanner graph. The algorithm has the same computational
complexity than BP, but it can decode a higher fraction of errors when applied
over the BEC. In this paper, we focus on the asymptotic performance of the TEP
decoder, as the block size tends to infinity. We describe the TEP decoder by a
set of differential equations that represents the residual graph evolution
during the decoding process. The solution of these equations yields the
capacity of this decoder for a given LDPC ensemble over the BEC. We show that

Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) on board the Hinode solar observatory is the
presence of persistent high temperature high speed outflows from the edges of
active regions. Measurements by EIS indicate that the outflows reach velocities
of 50 km/s with spectral line asymmetries approaching 200 km/s. It has been
suggested that these outflows may lie on open field lines that connect to the
heliosphere, and that they could potentially be a significant source of the
slow speed solar wind. A direct link has been difficult to establish, however.
In this letter, we use EIS measurements of spectral line intensities that are
sensitive to changes in the relative abundance of Si and S as a result of the
first ionization potential (FIP) effect, to measure the chemical composition in
the outflow regions of AR 10978 over a period of 5 days in December 2007. We
find that Si is always enhanced over S by a factor of 3--4. This is generally
consistent with the enhancement factor of low FIP elements measured in-situ in
the slow solar wind by non-spectroscopic methods. Plasma with a slow wind-like
composition was therefore flowing from the edge of the active region for at
least 5 days. Furthermore, on December 10--11, when the outflow from the
western side was favorably oriented in the Earth direction, the Si/S ratio was
found to match the value measured a few days later by ACE/SWICS. These results
provide strong observational evidence for a direct connection between the solar
wind, and the coronal plasma in the outflow regions.

model, edges of the square lattice are partitioned into $x$ and $z$-types that
alternate along both coordinate directions and thus arrange into a checkerboard
pattern of $x$ and $z$-plaquettes; classical O(2)-spins are then coupled
ferromagnetically via their first components over the $x$-edges and via their
second components over the $z$-edges. We prove from first principles that, at
sufficiently low temperatures, the model exhibits orientational long-range
order (OLRO) in one of the two principal lattice directions. Magnetic order is
precluded by the underlying symmetries. A similar set of results is inferred
also for quantum systems with large spin although the $\frac12$ instance
currently seems beyond the reach of rigorous methods. We point out that the
Ne\'el order in the plaquette energy distribution observed in numerical
simulations is an artefact of the OLRO and a judicious choice of the plaquette
energies. In particular, this order seems to disappear when the plaquette
energies are adjusted to vanish at the ground-state level. We also discuss the
specific role of the underlying symmetries in Wenzel and Janke's simulations

significantly increase the speed of convergence.

of CdTe were found around 4 GPa, i.e. close to the onset of the cinnabar to
rock-salt transition. In particular, the carrier concentration increases by
more than five orders of magnitude. Additionally, an abrupt decrease of the

comparison with optical, thermoelectric, and x-ray diffraction experiments. The
metallic character of the Cmcm phase of CdTe is confirmed and a semi-metallic

the drift. We shall show that the large-time behavior of solutions depends on a

make all or only part of the cold dark matter. This corresponds to either
imposing full WMAP relic density limits or just its upper bound for
constraining the MSSM parameters. We consider several realisations of the MSSM,
namely, three GUT-scale SUSY breaking scenarios with a handful of parameters
corresponding to the CMSSM, anomaly mediation and the large volume string
scenarios as well as the weak-scale 25-parameter phenomenological MSSM (pMSSM).
The results give a data-based quantitative evidence for a multicomponent cold
dark matter. The pMSSM posterior samples indicate that the choice of imposing
full WMAP limits or just its upper bound affects mostly the gaugino-higgsino
content of the neutralino and, against naive expectations, essentially not any
other sector.

~5000 galaxies with imaging and spectroscopic data from GALEX and the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey, which lie within the current footprint of the Arecibo
Legacy Fast ALFA (ALFALFA) Survey. Our galaxies are selected to have stellar
masses greater than 10^10 Msun and redshifts in the range 0.025<z<0.05. We
extract a sub-sample of 1833 ""early-type"" galaxies with inclinations less than
70deg, with concentration indices C>2.6 and with light profiles that are well
fit by a De Vaucouleurs model. We then stack HI line spectra extracted from the
ALFALFA data cubes at the 3-D positions of the galaxies from these two samples
in bins of stellar mass, stellar mass surface density, central velocity
dispersion, and NUV-r colour. We use the stacked spectra to estimate the
average HI gas fractions M_HI/M_* of the galaxies in each bin.
  Our main result is that the HI content of a galaxy is not influenced by its
bulge. The average HI gas fractions of galaxies in both our samples correlate
most strongly with NUV-r colour and with stellar surface density. The relation
between average HI fraction and these two parameters is independent of
concentration index C. We have tested whether the average HI gas content of
bulge-dominated galaxies on the red sequence, differs from that of late-type
galaxies on the red sequence. We find no evidence that galaxies with a
significant bulge component are less efficient at turning their available gas
reservoirs into stars. This result is in contradiction with the ""morphological
quenching"" scenario proposed by Martig et al. (2009).

performance of the conventional CCSD(T) approach, calculations were carried out
using correlation-consistent polarized valence X-tuple-zeta bases, with X
ranging from 2 to 5. The contribution beyond the CCSD(T)-F12 model, obtained
from full configuration interaction (FCI) calculations for the valence-valence

collisional dynamics. When the LiH bond is allowed to vary, a seam of conical
intersections appears at C_{2v} geometries. At the linear LiH-Li geometry, the
conical intersection is at a Li-H distance which is only slightly larger than
the monomer equilibrium distance, but for nonlinear geometries it quickly
shifts to Li-H distances that are well outside the classical turning points of
the ground-state potential of LiH. Finally, the reaction channels for the

the squared energy. The optimal kernels are found to be a simple {\it pinched}

potential duality violations near the real axis in the complex s-plane, and the

piecewise continuous initial reconstruction with discontinuous jump at a cell
interface is usually used in modern computational fluid dynamics methods.
Starting from the discontinuity, a Riemann problem in the Godunov method is
solved for the flux evaluation across the cell interface in a finite volume
scheme. With the increasing of Mach number in the CFD simulations, the
adaptation of the Riemann solver seems introduce intrinsically a mechanism to
develop instabilities in strong shock regions. Theoretically, the Riemann
solution of the Euler equations are based on the equilibrium assumption, which
may not be valid in the non-equilibrium shock layer. In order to clarify the
flow physics from a discontinuity, the unsteady flow behavior of
one-dimensional contact and shock wave is studied on a time scale of (0~10000)
times of the particle collision time. In the study of the non-equilibrium flow
behavior from a discontinuity, the collision-less Boltzmann equation is first
used for the time scale within one particle collision time, then the direct
simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method will be adapted to get the further
evolution solution. The transition from the free particle transport to the
dissipative Navier-Stokes (NS) solutions are obtained as an increasing of time.
The exact Riemann solution becomes a limiting solution with infinite number of
particle collisions. For the high Mach number flow simulations, the points in
the shock transition region, even though the region is enlarged numerically to
the mesh size, should be considered as the points inside a highly
non-equilibrium shock layer.

from hopping to critical regime of the metal-insulator transition, depending on
the subtle details of morphology. The extent of electrical-connectivity in

and target consisted of 1.5 micron monodisperse, spherical SiO2 monomers with
volume filling factors of 0.15 (projectiles) and 0.45 (targets). The
projectiles were accelerated by a solenoid magnet and combined with a magazine
with which 25 impacts onto the same spot on the target could be performed in
vacuum. We measured the mass-accretion efficiency and the volume filling factor
for different impact velocities between 1.5 and 6.0 m/s. The experiments at the
lowest impact speeds were performed in the Bremen drop-tower under microgravity
conditions. Within this velocity range we found a linear increase of the
accretion efficiency with increasing velocity. In the laboratory experiments,
the accretion efficiency increases from 0.12 to 0.21 in units of the projectile
mass. The recorded images of the impacts showed that the mass transfer from the
projectile to the target leads to the growth of a conical structure on the
target. From the images we also measured the volume filling factors of the
grown structures, which ranged from 0.15 (uncompacted) to 0.40 (significantly
compacted) with increasing impact speed. These results augment our knowledge of

capabilities). In this paper, we extend our previous studies, which were
limited to a two-dimensional cylindrical scenario, to the three-dimensional
spherical case. More specifically, via a generalized (coordinate-mapped)
Mie-series approach, we derive a general analytical full-wave solution
pertaining to plane-wave-excited configurations featuring a spherical object
surrounded by a TO-based invisibility cloak coupled via a vacuum layer to an
anti-cloak, and explore the various interactions of interest. With a number of
selected examples, we illustrate the cloaking and field-restoring capabilities
of various configurations, highlighting similarities and differences with
respect to the cylindrical case, with special emphasis on sensor-cloaking
scenarios and ideas for approximate implementations that require the use of
double-positive media only.

  Applications to Coherent Particle Transport and to Quantum~Brownian Motion","PhD thesis",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We employ the theoretical framework of positive operator valued measures, to
study Markovian open quantum systems. In particular, we discuss how a quantum
system influences its environment. Using the theory of indirect measurements,
we then draw conclusions about the information we could hypothetically obtain
about the system by observing the environment. Although the environment is not
actually observed, we can use these results to describe the change of the
quantum system due to its interaction with the environment. We apply this
technique to two different problems.
  In the first part, we study the coherently driven dynamics of a particle on a
rail of quantum dots. This tunnelling between adjacent quantum dots can be
controlled externally. We employ an adiabatic scheme similar to stimulated
Raman adiabatic passage, to transfer the particle between different quantum
dots. We compare two fundamentally different sources of decoherence.
  In the second part, we study the dynamics of a free quantum particle, which
experiences random collisions with gas particles. Previous studies on this
topic applied scattering theory to momentum eigenstates. We present a
supplementary approach, where we develop a rigorous measurement interpretation
of the collision process to derive a master equation. Finally, we study the
collisional decoherence process in terms of the Wigner function. We restrict
ourselves to one spatial dimension. Nevertheless, we find some interesting new
insight, including that the previously celebrated quantum contribution to
position diffusion is not real, but a consequence of the Markovian
approximation. Further, we discover that the leading decoherence process is due
to phase averaging, rather than induced by the information transfer between the
colliding particles.

The server is equipped with a random-access buffer of limited capacity which
can be used to rearrange items. The problem is to design a scheduling strategy
that decides upon the order in which items from the buffer are sent to the
server. Each type change incurs unit cost, and thus, the cost minimizing
objective is to minimize the total number of type changes for serving the
entire sequence. This problem is motivated by various applications in

attention in the last few years. The main focus has been on online competitive
algorithms. Surprisingly little is known on the basic offline problem. In this

dyadic scalings and translations of a single function, but including a precise
control of directionality. Of the many directional representation systems
proposed in the last decade, shearlets are among the most versatile and
successful systems. The reason for this being an extensive list of desirable
properties: shearlet systems can be generated by one function, they provide
precise resolution of wavefront sets, they allow compactly supported analyzing
elements, they are associated with fast decomposition algorithms, and they
provide a unified treatment of the continuum and the digital realm.
  The aim of this paper is to introduce some key concepts in directional
representation systems and to shed some light on the success of shearlet
systems as directional representation systems. In particular, we will give an
overview of the different paths taken in shearlet theory with focus on

close to the optical band; within this low typical frequency framework, we use

resonant cavity. We use neither the rotating-wave approximation nor the Markov
approximation. The qubit-cavity coupling strength is varied from weak, to
strong, even to lower bound of the ultra-strong. For the weak-coupling case,
the spontaneous emission spectrum of the qubit is a single peak, with its
location depending on the spectral density of the qubit environment. Increasing
the qubit-cavity coupling increases the asymmetry (the positions about the
qubit energy spacing and heights of the two peaks) of the two spontaneous
emission peaks (which are related to the vacuum Rabi splitting) more.
Explicitly, for a qubit in a low-frequency intrinsic bath, the height asymmetry
of the splitting peaks becomes larger, when the qubit-cavity coupling strength
is increased. However, for a qubit in an Ohmic bath, the height asymmetry of
the spectral peaks is inverted from the same case of the low-frequency bath,
when the qubit is strongly coupled to the cavity. Increasing the qubit-cavity
coupling to the lower bound of the ultra-strong regime, the height asymmetry of
the left and right peak heights are inverted, which is consistent with the same
case of low-frequency bath, only relatively weak. Therefore, our results
explicitly show how the height asymmetry in the spontaneous emission spectrum
peaks depends not only on the qubit-cavity coupling, but also on the type of
intrinsic noise experienced by the qubit.

own Solar System. As such, one expects extrasolar planets to present a wide
range of distinctive features, therefore the characterisation of Earth- and
super Earth-like planets is becoming of key importance in scientific research.
The SEARCH (Spectropolarimetric Exoplanet AtmospheRe CHaracerisation) mission
proposal of this paper represents one possible approach to realising these
objectives. The mission goals of SEARCH include the detailed characterisation
of a wide variety of exoplanets, ranging from terrestrial planets to gas
giants. More specifically, SEARCH will determine atmospheric properties such as
cloud coverage, surface pressure and atmospheric composition, and may also be
capable of identifying basic surface features. To resolve a planet with a semi
major axis of down to 1.4AU and 30pc distant SEARCH will have a mirror system
consisting of two segments, with elliptical rim, cut out of a parabolic mirror.
This will yield an effective diameter of 9 meters along one axis. A phase mask
coronagraph along with an integral spectrograph will be used to overcome the
contrast ratio of star to planet light. Such a mission would provide invaluable
data on the diversity present in extrasolar planetary systems and much more
could be learned from the similarities and differences compared to our own
Solar System. This would allow our theories of planetary formation, atmospheric
accretion and evolution to be tested, and our understanding of regions such as
the outer limit of the Habitable Zone to be further improved.

radiative transfer in ProDiMo includes isotropic scattering. The dust

various heating and cooling processes. The gas and dust interact thermally via
photoelectrons, radiatively, and via gas accommodation on grain surfaces. As a
result, the gas is much hotter than in the thermo-coupled case, where the gas
and dust temperatures are equal, reaching a few thousands K in the upper disc
layers and making the inner rim higher. A physically motivated density drop at
the inner radius (""soft-edge"") results in rounded inner rims, which appear
ring-like in near-infrared images. The combination of lower gravity pull and
hot gas beyond ~1 AU results in a disc atmosphere that reaches a height over

every codeword coordinate can be recovered, probabilistically, by reading at

$\delta m$ values of $j \in [m]$ such that the line through $v_i,v_j$ contains

emission in accreting black holes (BH) should be imprinted in the observational
apperances of the power law tails in the X-ray spectra from these objects.
Different spectral states exhibited by galactic BH binaries allow examination
of the photon upscattering under different accretion regimes. We revisit the
data collected by Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) from the BH X-ray binary
XTE J1550-564 during two periods of X-ray activity in 1998 and 2000 focusing on
the behavior of the high energy cutoff of the power law part of the spectrum.
For the 1998 outburst the transition from the low-hard state to the
intermediate state was accompanied by a gradual decrease in the cutoff energy
which then showed an abrupt reversal to a clear increasing trend as the source
evolved to the very high and high-soft states. The 2000 outburst showed only
the decreasing part of this pattern. Notably, the photon indexes corresponding
to the cutoff increase for the 1998 event are much higher than the index values
reached during the 2000 rise transition. We attribute this difference in the
cutoff energy behavior to the different partial contributions of the thermal
and non-thermal (bulk motion) Comptonization in photon upscattering. Namely,
during the 1998 event the higher accretion rate presumably provided more
cooling to the Comptonizing media and thus reducing the effectiveness of the
thermal upscattering process. Under these conditions the bulk motion takes a
leading role in boosting the input soft photons. Monte Carlo simulations of the
Comptonization in a bulk motion region near an accreting black hole by Laurent
& Titarchuk 2010 strongly support this scenario.

$L_n(\Phi,\xi,\cdot)$ in $L_q({\II}^d)$ we use the quantity
$$r_n(B^\alpha_{p,\theta})_q \ := \ \inf_{H,\xi} \ \sup_{f \in
B^\alpha_{p,\theta}} \, \|f - L_n(\Phi,xi,f)\|_q$$, where the infimum is taken
over all grids $\xi = \{x^j\}_{j=1}^n$ and all families $\Phi =
\{\phi_j\}_{j=1}^n$ in $L_q({\II}^d)$. We explicitly constructed linear
sampling algorithms $L_n(\Phi,\xi,\cdot)$ on the grid $\xi = \ G^d(m):=
\{(2^{-k_1}s_1,...,2^{-k_d}s_d) \in \II^d : \ k_1 + ... + k_d \le m\}$, with
$\Phi$ a family of linear combinations of mixed B-splines which are mixed
tensor products of either integer or half integer translated dilations of the
centered B-spline of order $r$. The grid $G^d(m)$ is of the size $2^m m^{d-1}$
and sparse in comparing with the generating dyadic coordinate cube grid of the
size $2^{dm}$. For various $0<p,q,\theta \le \infty$ and $1/p < \alpha < r$, we
proved upper bounds for the worst case error $ \sup_{f \in B^\alpha_{p,\theta}}
\, \|f - L_n(\Phi,\xi,f)\|_q$ which coincide with the asymptotic order of
$r_n(B^\alpha_{p,\theta})_q$ in some cases. A key role in constructing these
linear sampling algorithms, plays a quasi-interpolant representation of
functions $f \in B^\alpha_{p,\theta}$ by mixed B-spline series.

the Fornax Cluster and a prolific producer of Type Ia supernovae, having hosted
four observed events since 1980. Here we present detailed optical and
near-infrared light curves of the spectroscopically normal SN 2006dd. These
data are used, along with previously published photometry of the normal SN
1980N and SN 1981D, and the fast-declining, low-luminosity SN 2006mr, to
compute independent estimates of the host reddening for each supernova, and the
distance to NGC 1316. From the three normal supernovae, we find a distance of
17.8 +/- 0.3 (random) +/- 0.3 (systematic) Mpc for Ho = 72. Distance moduli
derived from the ""EBV"" and Tripp methods give values that are mutually
consistent to 4 -- 8%. Moreover, the weighted means of the distance moduli for
these three SNe for three methods agree to within 3%. This consistency is
encouraging and supports the premise that Type Ia supernovae are reliable
distance indicators at the 5% precision level or better. On the other hand, the
two methods used to estimate the distance of the fast-declining SN 2006mr both
yield a distance to NGC 1316 which is 25-30% larger. This disparity casts doubt
on the suitability of fast-declining events for estimating extragalactic
distances. Modest-to-negligible host galaxy reddening values are derived for
all four supernovae. Nevertheless, two of them (SN 2006dd and SN 2006mr) show
strong NaID interstellar lines in the host galaxy system. The strength of this
absorption is completely inconsistent with the small reddening values derived
from the supernova light curves if the gas in NGC 1316 is typical of that found
in the interstellar medium of the Milky Way. In addition, the equivalent width
of the NaID lines in SN 2006dd appear to have weakened significantly some
100-150 days after explosion.

X-ray astronomy. Typically covering the 0.3-10.0 keV energy range, CCDs are
able to detect photoelectric absorption edges and K shell lines from most
abundant metals. New CCDs also offer resolutions of 30-50 (E/dE), which is
sufficient to detect lines in hot plasmas and to resolve many lines shaped by
dynamical processes in accretion flows. The spectral capabilities of X-ray CCDs
have been particularly important in detecting relativistic emission lines from
the inner disks around accreting neutron stars and black holes. One drawback of
X-ray CCDs is that spectra can be distorted by photon ""pile-up"", wherein two or
more photons may be registered as a single event during one frame time. We have
conducted a large number of simulations using a statistical model of photon
pile-up to assess its impacts on relativistic disk line and continuum spectra
from stellar-mass black holes and neutron stars. The simulations cover the
range of current X-ray CCD spectrometers and operational modes typically used
to observe neutron stars and black holes in X-ray binaries. Our results suggest
that severe photon pile-up acts to falsely narrow emission lines, leading to
falsely large disk radii and falsely low spin values. In contrast, our
simulations suggest that disk continua affected by severe pile-up are measured
to have falsely low flux values, leading to falsely small radii and falsely
high spin values. The results of these simulations and existing data appear to
suggest that relativistic disk spectroscopy is generally robust against pile-up
when this effect is modest.

intermediate polar (IP), EX Hya, together with the spin phase-resolved spectra
during two different epochs using the X-ray Multi-Mirror Mission, European
Photon Imaging Camera (pn instrument). We find that the source at the two
epochs has the same X-ray luminosity of $\sim$ 6.5 $\times$ 10$^{31}$ erg
s$^{-1}$. We detect spectral variations between the 2000 and 2003 observations
of the source. We fitted the spectrum using a neutral hydrogen absorption model
with or without covering fraction together with Gaussians for emission lines,
two collisional equilibrium plasma emission models (MEKAL) and a cooling-flow
plasma emission model (VMCFLOW). We find that two of the three emission
components ($kT$=0.6-0.8 keV and $kT$=1.3-1.7 keV) fitted by the MEKAL models
are almost constant over the spin and orbital phases and also over the two
different epochs with the normalisation varying directly proportional to the
flux when the data are folded according to the orbital and spin phase
indicating that the slight variation may be due to occultation. The emission
modeled by the VMCFLOW changes over the spin and orbital phases and the 2000
and 2003 observations reveal two different ranges of temperatures (3-33 and
8-61 keV respectively) that model the shock zone in the accretion column/s. The
ratios of the spin maximum to minimum and the orbital maximum to minimum
spectra along with the increase in the plasma temperatures indicate that the
spectrum gets harder in the minimum phases of both orbital and spin periods. In
the 2003 observation, a 6.4 keV fluorescent Fe emission line is present at the
orbital minima in a range of phases from 0.9 to 1.3 and it is absent otherwise.
This indicates that there is reflection from the disc most likely from a large
bulge at the accretion impact zone.

both the bound and the continuum states. If the Hamiltonian depends on a set of
parameters, these could be tuned to a transition from bound to continuum
states. The behavior of systems near the threshold, which separates
bound-states from continuum states, is important in the study of such
phenomenon as: ionization of atoms and molecules, molecule dissociation,
scattering collisions and stability of matter. In general, the energy is
non-analytic as a function of the Hamiltonian parameters or a bound-state does
not exist at the threshold energy. The overall goal of this chapter is to show
how one can predict, generate and identify new class of stable quantum systems
using large-dimensional models and the finite size scaling approach. Within
this approach, the finite size corresponds not to the spatial dimension but to
the number of elements in a complete basis set used to expand the exact
eigenfunction of a given Hamiltonian. This method is efficient and very
accurate for estimating the critical parameters, $\{\lambda_i\}$, for stability
of a given Hamiltonian, $H(\lambda_i)$. We present two methods of obtaining
critical parameters using finite size scaling for a given quantum Hamiltonian:
The finite element method and the basis set expansion method.

spectroscopy for the star forming regions and associated outflows, allowing us
to look at how the physical properties of the hot ISM such as temperature,
hydrogen column density and metal abundances vary throughout these galaxies. We
find temperatures of >0.41 keV and 0.85 +0.59/-0.12 keV, electron densities of
>1.87 eta^(-1/2) x 10^(-3) cm^(-3) and 0.21 +0.03/-0.04 eta^(-1/2) x 10^(-3)

eta^(1/2) x 10^7 M_{\odot} in the plane and halo of NGC 4490 respectively,
where eta is the filling factor of the hot gas. The abundance ratios of Ne, Mg
and Si with respect to Fe are found to be consistent with those predicted by
theoretical models of type II supernovae. The thermal energy in the hot ISM is
~5% of the total mechanical energy input from supernovae, so it is likely that
the hot ISM has been enriched and heated by type II supernovae. The X-ray
emission is anticorrelated with the H-alpha and mid-infrared emission,
suggesting that the hot gas is bounded by filaments of cooler ionized hydrogen
mixed with warm dust.
