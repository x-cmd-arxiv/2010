minimal Lagrangian surface in CH2 from the data of a compact hyperbolic Riemann
surface and a small holomorphic cubic differential. The minimal Lagrangian
surface is invariant under an SU(2,1) action of the fundamental group. We
further parameterise a neighborhood of the R-Fuchsian representations in the
representation space by pairs consisting of a point in Teichmuller space and a
small cubic differential. By constructing a fundamental domain, we show these

of Guichard and Parker-Platis. Our proof involves using the Toda lattice
framework to construct an SU(2,1) frame corresponding to a minimal Lagrangian
surface. Then the equation of Tzitzeica type is an integrability condition. A
very similar equation to ours governs minimal surfaces in hyperbolic 3-space,
and our paper can be interpreted as an analog of the theory of minimal surfaces
in quasi-Fuchsian manifolds, as first studied by Uhlenbeck.

facility location and minimum latency (ML) problems, where facilities need to
be opened to serve clients and also need to be sequentially activated before
they can provide service. Formally, we are given a set \F of n facilities with
facility-opening costs {f_i}, a set of m clients, and connection costs {c_{ij}}
specifying the cost of assigning a client j to a facility i, a root node r
denoting the depot, and a time metric d on \F\cup{r}. Our goal is to open a
subset F of facilities, find a path P starting at r and spanning F to activate
the open facilities, and connect each client j to a facility \phi(j)\in F, so
as to minimize \sum_{i\in F}f_i +\sum_{clients j}(c_{\phi(j),j}+t_j), where t_j
is the time taken to reach \phi(j) along path P. We call this the minimum
latency uncapacitated facility location (MLUFL) problem.
  Our main result is an O(\log n\max{\log n,\log m})-approximation for MLUFL.
We also show that any improvement in this approximation guarantee, implies an
improvement in the (current-best) approximation factor for group Steiner tree.
We obtain constant approximations for two natural special cases of the problem:
(a) related MLUFL (metric connection costs that are a scalar multiple of the
time metric); (b) metric uniform MLUFL (metric connection costs, unform
time-metric). Our LP-based methods are versatile and easily adapted to yield
approximation guarantees for MLUFL in various more general settings, such as
(i) when the latency-cost of a client is a function of the delay faced by the
facility to which it is connected; and (ii) the k-route version, where k
vehicles are routed in parallel to activate the open facilities. Our LP-based
understanding of MLUFL also offers some LP-based insights into ML, which we
believe is a promising direction for obtaining improvements for ML.

compact star clusters or Massive Black Holes in central regions of galaxies.
The dynamical friction force can be well approximated by Chandrasekhar's
standard formula, but recent investigations show, that corrections to the
Coulomb logarithm are necessary. With a large set of N-body simulations we show
that the improved formula for the Coulomb logarithm fits the orbital decay very
well for circular and eccentric orbits. The local scale-length of the
background density distribution serves as the maximum impact parameter for a
wide range of power-law indices of -1 ... -5. For each type of code the
numerical resolution must be compared to the effective minimum impact parameter
in order to determine the Coulomb logarithm. We also quantify the correction
factors by using self-consistent velocity distribution functions instead of the
standard Maxwellian often used. These factors enter directly the decay
timescale and cover a range of 0.5 ... 3 for typical orbits. The new Coulomb
logarithm combined with self-consistent velocity distribution functions in the
Chandrasekhar formula provides a significant improvement of orbital decay times
with correction up to one order of magnitude compared to the standard case. We
suggest the general use of the improved formula in parameter studies as well as
in special applications.

with two prescribed starting points at time $t=0$ and two prescribed ending
points at time $t=1$ in a critical regime where the paths fill two tangent
ellipses in the time-space plane as $n \to \infty$. The limiting mean density
for the positions of the Brownian paths at the time of tangency consists of two
touching semicircles, possibly of different sizes. We show that in an
appropriate double scaling limit, there is a new familiy of limiting
determinantal point processes with integrable correlation kernels that are
expressed in terms of a new Riemann-Hilbert problem of size $4\times 4$. We
prove solvability of the Riemann-Hilbert problem and establish a remarkable
connection with the Hastings-McLeod solution of the Painlev\'e II equation. We
show that this Painlev\'e II transcendent also appears in the critical limits
of the recurrence coefficients of the multiple Hermite polynomials that are
associated with the non-intersecting Brownian motions. Universality suggests
that the new limiting kernels apply to more general situations whenever a
limiting mean density vanishes according to two touching square roots, which
represents a new universality class.

we estimate the size and time evolution of the gravitational potential induced

QPOs namely, GRS 1915+105, XTE J1550-564, XTE J1859+226 and Cygnus X-2. We
compute and focus on the form of the ACFs in search of systematics or specific
temporal properties at the time scales associated with the known QPO
frequencies in comparison with the corresponding PDS. Even within our small
object sample we find both similarities as well as significant and subtle
differences in the form of the ACFs both amongst black holes and between black
holes and neutron stars to warrant a closer look at the QPO phenomenon in the
time domain: The QPO features manifest as an oscillatory behavior of the ACF at
lags near zero; the oscillation damps exponentially on time scales equal to the
inverse QPO width to a level of a percent or so. In black holes this
oscillatory behavior is preserved and easily discerned at much longer lags
while this is not the case for the neutron star system Cyg X-2. The ACF of GRS
1915+105 provides an exception to this general behavior in that its decay is
linear in time indicating an undamped oscillation of coherent phase. We present
simple ad hoc models that reproduce these diverse time domain behaviors and we
speculate that their origin is the phase coherence of the underlying
oscillation. It appears plausible that time domain analyses, complementary to
the more common frequency domain ones, could impose tighter constraints and
provide clues for the driving mechanisms behind the QPO phenomenon.

that even if purely poloidal initially, the magnetic fields produced in the

marginally, by detectors such as advanced LIGO or advanced Virgo. However,
magnetically induced modifications could become detectable in the case of

models. We have studied its importance on the period, the amplitude of the
solar cycle, and also in producing Maunder-like grand minima in these models.
First, we model the periods of the last 23 sunspot cycles by varying the
meridional circulation speed. If the dynamo is in a diffusion-dominated regime,
then we find that most of the cycle amplitudes also get modeled up to some
extent when we model the periods. Next, we propose that at the beginning of the
Maunder minimum the amplitude of meridional circulation dropped to a low value
and then after a few years it increased again. Several independent studies also
favor this assumption. With this assumption, a diffusion-dominated dynamo is
able to reproduce many important features of the Maunder minimum remarkably
well. If the dynamo is in a diffusion-dominated regime, then a slower
meridional circulation means that the poloidal field gets more time to diffuse
during its transport through the convection zone, making the dynamo weaker.
This consequence helps to model both the cycle amplitudes and the Maunder-like
minima. We, however, fail to reproduce these results if the dynamo is in an
advection-dominated regime.

The aim is to use the geographical position of a party as its only credential.
On the negative side, we show that if adversaries are allowed to share an
arbitrarily large entangled quantum state, no secure position-verification is
possible at all. We show a distributed protocol for computing any unitary
operation on a state shared between the different users, using local operations
and one round of classical communication. Using this surprising result, we
break any position-verification scheme of a very general form. On the positive
side, we show that if adversaries do not share any entangled quantum state but
can compute arbitrary quantum operations, secure position-verification is
achievable. Jointly, these results suggest the interesting question whether
secure position-verification is possible in case of a bounded amount of
entanglement. Our positive result can be interpreted as resolving this question
in the simplest case, where the bound is set to zero.
  In models where secure positioning is achievable, it has a number of
interesting applications. For example, it enables secure communication over an
insecure channel without having any pre-shared key, with the guarantee that
only a party at a specific location can learn the content of the conversation.
More generally, we show that in settings where secure position-verification is
achievable, other position-based cryptographic schemes are possible as well,
such as secure position-based authentication and position-based key agreement.

Cosmic-Ray-Dominated-Regions (CRDRs) characterize the ISM of galaxies during
events of high-density star formation, fundamentally altering its initial
conditions (Papadopoulos 2010). Solving the coupled chemical and thermal state
equations for dense UV-shielded gas reveals that the large cosmic ray energy
densities in such systems (U_{CR} (few)x(10^3-10^4) U_{CR,Gal}) will indeed
raise the minimum temperature of this phase (where the initial conditions of
star formation are set) from ~10K (as in the Milky Way) to (50-100)K. Moreover
in such extreme CRDRs the gas temperature remains fully decoupled from that of
the dust, with T_{kin} >> T_{dust}, even at high densities (n(H_2)~10^5--10^6
cm^{-3}), quite unlike CRDRs in the Milky Way where T_k T_{dust} when n(H_2) >=
10^5 cm^{-3}.
  These dramatically different star formation initial conditions will: a) boost
the Jeans mass of UV-shielded gas regions by factors of ~10--100 with respect
to those in quiescent or less extreme star forming systems, and b) ""erase"" the
so-called inflection point of the effective equation of state (EOS) of
molecular gas. Both these effects occur across the entire density range of
typical molecular clouds, and may represent {\it a new paradigm for all
high-density star formation in the Universe}, with cosmic rays as the key
driving mechanism, operating efficiently even in the high dust extinction
environments of extreme starbursts...

astrophysical plasmas using two and three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic
simulations. For weak magnetic fields, dilute plasmas are buoyantly unstable
for either sign of the temperature gradient: the heat-flux-driven buoyancy
instability (HBI) operates when the temperature increases with radius while the
magnetothermal instability (MTI) operates in the opposite limit. In contrast to
previous results, we show that, in the presence of a sustained temperature
gradient, the MTI drives strong turbulence and operates as an efficient
magnetic dynamo (akin to standard, adiabatic convection). Together, the
turbulent and magnetic energies contribute up to ~10% of the pressure support
in the plasma. In addition, the MTI drives a large convective heat flux, ~1.5%
of rho c_s^3. These findings are robust even in the presence of an external
source of strong turbulence. Our results on the nonlinear saturation of the HBI
are consistent with previous studies but we explain physically why the HBI
saturates quiescently by re-orienting the magnetic field (suppressing the
conductive heat flux through the plasma), while the MTI saturates by generating
sustained turbulence. We also systematically study how an external source of
turbulence affects the saturation of the HBI: such turbulence can disrupt the
HBI only on scales where the shearing rate of the turbulence is faster than the
growth rate of the HBI. In particular, our results provide a simple mapping
between the level of turbulence in a plasma and the effective isotropic thermal
conductivity. We discuss the astrophysical implications of these findings, with
a particular focus on the intracluster medium of galaxy clusters.

the tidal interactions between rotationally-supported dwarfs and MW-sized host
galaxies. Using a set of collisionless N-body simulations, we investigate the
efficiency of the tidal stirring mechanism. We explore a wide variety of dwarf
orbital configurations and initial structures and demonstrate that in most
cases the disky dwarfs experience significant mass loss and their stellar
components undergo a dramatic morphological and dynamical transformation: from
disks to bars and finally to pressure-supported spheroidal systems with
kinematic and structural properties akin to those of the classic dSphs in the
Local Group (LG). Our results suggest that such tidal transformations should be
common occurrences within the currently favored cosmological paradigm and
highlight the key factor responsible for an effective metamorphosis to be the
strength of the tidal shocks at the pericenters of the orbit. We demonstrate
that the combination of short orbital times and small pericenters,
characteristic of dwarfs being accreted at high redshift, induces the strongest
transformations. Our models also indicate that the transformation efficiency is
affected significantly by the structure of the progenitor disky dwarfs. Lastly,
we find that the dwarf remnants satisfy the relation Vmax = \sqrt{3} * sigma,
where sigma is the 1D, central stellar velocity dispersion and Vmax is the
maximum halo circular velocity, with intriguing implications for the missing
satellites problem. Overall, we conclude that the action of tidal forces from
the hosts constitutes a crucial evolutionary mechanism for shaping the nature
of dwarf galaxies in environments such as that of the LG. Environmental
processes of this type should thus be included as ingredients in models of
dwarf galaxy formation and evolution.

the concentration index for classification purposes can cause a severe loss of

show that, for poorly resolved galaxies, concentration index and M_20 suffer

reliability of these parameters for classification purposes. Two-dimensional
Sersic profiles accounting for centroid and ellipticity are identified as the
currently most reliable parametrisation scheme in the regime of intermediate
signal-to-noise ratios and resolutions, where asymmetries and substructures do
not play an important role. We argue that basis functions provide good
parametrisation schemes in the regimes of high signal-to-noise ratios and

asymptotic giant branch star --- has been a matter of debate for more than 25
years. Here we use a quantitative analysis of the rapid optical brightness
variations from this companion, Mira B, which we observed with the Nickel
telescope at Lick Observatory, to show that it is a white dwarf (WD). The
amplitude of aperiodic optical variations on time scales of minutes to tens of
minutes (approximately 0.2 mag) is consistent with that of accreting WDs in
cataclysmic variables on these same time scales. It is significantly greater
than that expected from an accreting main-sequence star. With Mira B identified
as a WD, its ultraviolet (UV) and optical luminosities, along with constraints
on the WD effective temperature from the UV, indicate that it accretes at
~1e-10 solar masses per year. We do not find any evidence that the accretion
rate is higher than predicted by Bondi-Hoyle theory. The accretion rate is high
enough, however, to explain the weak X-ray emission, since the accretion-disk
boundary layer around a low-mass WD accreting at this rate is likely to be
optically thick and therefore to emit primarily in the far or extreme UV.
Furthermore, the finding that Mira B is a WD means that it has experienced, and
will continue to experience nova explosions, roughly every million years. It
also highlights the similarity between Mira AB and other jet-producing
symbiotic binaries such as R Aquarii, CH Cygni, and MWC 560, and therefore
raises the possibility that Mira B launched the recently discovered bipolar
streams from this system.

characteristic property of unified flavour models and can reduce the large
number of free parameters related to the flavour sector of the SM. The Yukawa
couplings of the down-type quarks and charged leptons are affected within SUSY
models by tan beta-enhanced threshold corrections. We analyse these corrections
and give simple analytic expressions and numerical estimates for them. The
threshold corrections sensitively depend on the soft SUSY breaking parameters.
Especially, they determine if the affected Yukawa couplings are enhanced or
suppressed. In a first approach, we make some plausible assumptions about the
soft SUSY parameters. In a second, more sophisticated approach we use three
common breaking schemes in which all the soft breaking parameters at the
electroweak scale can be calculated from only a handful of parameters. Within
this approach, we apply various phenomenological constraints on the
supersymmetric parameters and find in this way new viable Yukawa coupling
relations, for example y_mu/y_s = 9/2 or 6 or y_tau/y_b = 3/2 in SU(5).
Furthermore, we study a special class of quark mass matrix textures for small
tan beta where theta_13^u = theta_13^d = 0. We derive sum rules for the quark
mixing parameters and find a simple relation between the two phases delta_12^u

simple phase structure for the quark mass matrices. To complement the
aforementioned considerations, we give two explicit examples in an SU(5)

probe into the temperature of the horizontal branch (HB) stars in these

the core density of a cluster and its FUV-NUV colour, with dense clusters
having bluer ultraviolet colours. These results are consistent with a
population of (FUV bright) extreme-HB (EHB) stars, the production of which is
related to the stellar density in the clusters. Such a relationship may be
expected if the formation of EHB stars is enhanced in dense clusters due to
dynamical interactions. We also consider the contribution of low mass X-ray
binaries (LMXBs) to the integrated FUV luminosity of a cluster. We note that
two of the three metal rich clusters, identified by Rey et al. 2007 as having a
FUV excess, are known to host LMXBs in outburst. Considering the FUV luminosity
of Galactic LMXBs, we suggest that a single LMXB is unlikely to produce more

a Poisson distribution model for inner-shell occupancy, exploits measurable
inter-ionic correlation functions, and is correct at the closest pair distances
whether primitive electrolyte solutions models or molecularly detailed models
are considered, and for low electrolyte concentrations in all cases. With
detailed models these generalizations includes non-ionic interactions and
solvation effects. These generalizations are relevant for computational
analysis of bi-molecular reactive processes in solution. Comparisons with

accurate for a slightly supersaturated solution of tetraethylammonium

question has two sides, the first of which focuses on the lack of an external
channel in the counterexample. Using existing results, we argue that the core
difficulty in the counterexample is retained even in the presence of such a
channel. The second side questions the LQG formulation of the counterexample.
We consider alternative formulations and show that the understanding developed
for the LQG case guides the investigation for these other cases as well.
Specifically, we consider 1) a variation on the original counterexample with
general, but bounded, noise distributions, and 2) an adversarial extension with
bounded disturbance and quadratic costs. For each of these formulations, we
show that quantization-based nonlinear strategies outperform linear strategies
by an arbitrarily large factor. Further, these nonlinear strategies also
perform within a constant factor of the optimal, uniformly over all possible
parameter choices (for fixed noise distributions in the Bayesian case).
  Fortuitously, the assumption of bounded noise results in a significant
simplification of proofs as compared to those for the LQG formulation.
Therefore, the results in this paper are also of pedagogical interest.

the Hamiltonian equations of motion describing the conservative dynamics of the

incorporate an effective treatment of dissipation through gravitational
radiation. We evolve these equations for systems with orbital eccentricity and
precessing spins. We find that, while spin-spin coupling corrections can
destroy constant radius orbits in principle, the effect is so small that orbits
will reliably tend to quasi-spherical orbits as angular momentum and energy are
lost to gravitational radiation. Still, binaries that are initially highly
eccentric may retain eccentricity as they pass into the detectable bandwidth of
ground-based gravitational wave detectors. We also show that a useful set of
natural frequencies for an orbit demonstrating both spin precession and
periastron precession is comprised of (1) the frequency of angular motion in
the orbital plane, (2) the frequency of the plane precession, and (3) the

phase transitions were believed to be continuous, however, in 2009, a
remarkably different, discontinuous phase transition was reported in a new
so-called ""explosive percolation"" problem. Each link in this problem is
established by a specific optimization process. Here, employing strict
analytical arguments and numerical calculations, we find that in fact the
""explosive percolation"" transition is continuous though with an uniquely small
critical exponent of the percolation cluster size. These transitions provide a
new class of critical phenomena in irreversible systems and processes.

LHC ($\sqrt s=14$ TeV, 1 fb$^{-1}$) to find SUSY within the 19-dimensional
pMSSM subspace of the MSSM using their standard transverse missing energy and
long-lived particle searches that were essentially designed for mSUGRA. To this
end, we employ a set of $\sim 71$k previously generated model points in the
19-dimensional parameter space that satisfy all of the existing experimental
and theoretical constraints. Employing ATLAS-generated SM backgrounds and
following their approach in each of 11 missing energy analyses as closely as
possible, we explore all of these $71$k model points for a possible SUSY
signal. To test our analysis procedure, we first verify that we faithfully
reproduce the published ATLAS results for the signal distributions for their
benchmark mSUGRA model points. We then show that, requiring all sparticle
masses to lie below 1(3) TeV, almost all(two-thirds) of the pMSSM model points
are discovered with a significance $S>5$ in at least one of these 11 analyses
assuming a 50\% systematic error on the SM background. If this systematic error
can be reduced to only 20\% then this parameter space coverage is increased.
These results are indicative that the ATLAS SUSY search strategy is robust
under a broad class of Supersymmetric models. We then explore in detail the
properties of the kinematically accessible model points which remain
unobservable by these search analyses in order to ascertain problematic cases
which may arise in general SUSY searches.

  Topology","submitted for publication",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Loss tomography has received considerable attention in recent years and a
number of estimators have been proposed. Unfortunately, almost all of them are
devoted to the tree topology despite the general topology is more common in
practice. In addition, most of the works presented in the literature rely on
iterative approximation to search for the maximum of a likelihood function
formed from observations, which have been known neither scalable nor efficient.
In contrast to the tree topology, there is few paper dedicated to the general
topology because of the lack of understanding the impacts created by the probes
sent by different sources. We in this paper present the analytical results
obtained recently for the general topology that show the correlation created by
the probes sent by multiple sources to a node located in an intersection of
multiple trees. The correlation is expressed by a set of polynomials of the
pass rates of the paths connecting the sources to the node. In addition to the
expression, a closed form solution is proposed to obtain the MLE of the pass
rates of the paths connecting the sources to the node. Then, two strategies are
proposed to estimate the loss rate of a link for the general topology: one is
path-based and the other is link-based, depending on whether we need to obtain
the pass rate of a path first. The two strategies are compared in the context
of the general topology that shows each has its advantages and the link-based
one is more general. Apart from proving the estimates obtained are the MLEs, we
prove the estimator presented here has the optimal asymptotic property.

in Sato et al. (2009), we study the covariance matrix of cosmic shear
correlation functions, which is the standard statistics used in the previous
measurements. The shear correlation function of a particular separation angle
is affected by Fourier modes over a wide range of multipoles, even beyond a
survey area, which complicates the analysis of the covariance matrix. To
overcome such obstacles we first construct Gaussian shear simulations from the
1000 realizations, and then use the Gaussian simulations to disentangle the
Gaussian covariance contribution to the covariance matrix we measured from the
original simulations. We found that an analytical formula of Gaussian
covariance overestimates the covariance amplitudes due to an effect of finite
survey area. Furthermore, the clean separation of the Gaussian covariance
allows to examine the non-Gaussian covariance contributions as a function of
separation angles and source redshifts. For upcoming surveys with typical
source redshifts of z_s=0.6 and 1.0, the non-Gaussian contribution to the
diagonal covariance components at 1 arcminute scales is greater than the
Gaussian contribution by a factor of 20 and 10, respectively. Predictions based
on the halo model qualitatively well reproduce the simulation results, however
show a sizable disagreement in the covariance amplitudes. By combining these
simulation results we develop a fitting formula to the covariance matrix for a
survey with arbitrary area coverage, taking into account effects of the
finiteness of survey area on the Gaussian covariance.

obtained from hard exclusive processes in ep/gamma p scattering, we evaluate
the impact parameter distribution of pp collisions with a hard parton-parton
process as a function of p_T of the produced parton (jet). We find that the
average pp impact parameters in such events depend very weakly on p_T in the
range 2 < p_T < few 100 GeV, while they are much smaller than those in
minimum-bias inelastic collisions. The impact parameters in turn govern the
observable transverse multiplicity in such events (in the direction
perpendicular to the trigger particle or jet). Measuring the transverse
multiplicity as a function of p_T thus provides an effective tool for
determining the minimum p_T for which a given trigger particle originates from
a hard parton-parton process. Additional tests of the proposed geometric
correlations are possible by measuring the dependence on the trigger rapidity.
Various strategies for implementing this method are outlined.

for high-contrast imaging systems. However, the wave-front error of an optics

presents an iterative optimization algorithm for the measurement of large
static wave-front errors directly from only one focal plane image. We firstly
measure the intensity of the pupil image to get the pupil function of the
system and acquire the aberrated image on the focal plane with a phase error
that is to be measured. Then we induce a dynamic phase to the tested pupil
function and calculate the associated intensity of the reconstructed image on
the focal plane. The algorithm is to minimize the intensity difference between
the reconstructed image and the tested aberrated image on the focal plane,
where the induced phase is as the variable of the optimization algorithm. The
simulation shows that the wave-front of an optics system can be theoretically
reconstructed with a high precision, which indicates that such an iterative
algorithm may be an effective way for the wave-front sensing for high-contrast

82 images, we are able to pay special attentions to the low-surface-brightness
areas (LSB areas) of the galaxies. The LSB areas make a difference to the
Sersic fittings and concentration indices, making both the indices less than
the typical values for ETGs. There are about 60% negative color gradients
(red-core) within 1.5Re , much more than the approximately 10% positive ones
(blue-core) within the same radius. However, taking into account of the LSB
areas, we find that the color gradients are not necessarily monotonic: about
one third of the red-core (or blue-core) galaxies have positive (or negative)
color gradients in the outer areas. So LSB areas not only make ETGs' Sersic
profiles deviate from de Vaucouleur ones and shift to the disk end, but also
reveal that quite a number of ETGs have opposite color gradients in inner and
outer areas. These outcomes remind us the necessity of double-Sersic fitting.
These LSB phenomena may be interpreted by mergers and thus different
metallicity in the outer areas. Isophotal parameters are also discussed briefly
in this paper: more disky nearby ETGs are spotted than boxy ones.

Fermi-liquid state at higher temperatures. For finite next-nearest-neighbor

transition between a compressible Mott gas and an incompressible Mott liquid

the critical temperature T_c extrapolates to zero as t' vanishes, we conclude
that a quantum critical point connects the Fermi-liquid to the pseudogap

analogous of the supercritical region in the liquid-gas transition.

With spectroscopic measurement in unpolarised light, the total magnetic flux
averaged over the stellar disc can be derived but very little information on
the field geometry is available. Spectropolarimetry provides a complementary
information on the large-scale component of the magnetic topology. With
Zeeman-Doppler Imaging (ZDI), this information can be retrieved to produce a
map of the vector magnetic field at the surface of the star, and in particular
to assess the relative importance of the poloidal and toroidal components as
well as the degree of axisymmetry of the field distribution. The development of
high-performance spectropolarimeters associated with multi-lines techniques and
ZDI allows us to explore magnetic topologies throughout the Hertzsprung-Russel
diagram, on stars spanning a wide range of mass, age and rotation period. These
observations bring novel constraints on magnetic field generation by dynamo
effect in cool stars. In particular, the study of solar twins brings new
insight on the impact of rotation on the solar dynamo, whereas the detection of

the precise role of the tachocline in this process.

a multi-channel multi-band superconductor model that an inverse isotope
exponent on the superconducting transition temperature Tc can be realized in
iron-based superconductors. Simultaneously, a subgroup of the authors of Ref. 1
performed the corresponding isotope effect experiment on (Ba, K)Fe2As2 by
investigating the iron isotope exchange effect on Tc [2]. In accordance with
their theoretical analysis they indeed report an unusually large sign reversed
isotope exponent of {\alpha} \simeq -0.18(3) which is in strong contrast to
previous experiments on the nominally same system with the same composition in
Ba, K content, namely Ba0.6K0.4Fe2As2 [3], where the exponent was determined to
be {\alpha} \simeq 0.37(3). This conflict remains unsolved until now with the
exception of Ref. 4 where the iron isotope exponent has been determined for
FeSe. In accordance with the results of Ref. 3 a large positive isotope
exponent has been seen thus questioning the outcome of Ref. 1 and implicitly
the findings of Ref. 2. Here, we do not comment on the controversial

The input to the popular matching problem is a bipartite graph G = (A U B,E),
where A is a set of people, B is a set of items, and each person a belonging to
A ranks a subset of items in an order of preference, with ties allowed. The
popular matching problem seeks to compute a matching M* between people and
items such that there is no matching M where more people are happier with M
than with M*. Such a matching M* is called a popular matching. However, there
are simple instances where no popular matching exists.
  Here we consider the following natural extension to the above problem:
associated with each item b belonging to B is a non-negative price cost(b),
that is, for any item b, new copies of b can be added to the input graph by
paying an amount of cost(b) per copy. When G does not admit a popular matching,
the problem is to ""augment"" G at minimum cost such that the new graph admits a
popular matching. We show that this problem is NP-hard; in fact, it is NP-hard
to approximate it within a factor of sqrt{n1}/2, where n1 is the number of
people. This problem has a simple polynomial time algorithm when each person
has a preference list of length at most 2. However, if we consider the problem
of ""constructing"" a graph at minimum cost that admits a popular matching that
matches all people, then even with preference lists of length 2, the problem
becomes NP-hard. On the other hand, when the number of copies of each item is
""fixed"", we show that the problem of computing a minimum cost popular matching
or deciding that no popular matching exists can be solved in O(mn1) time, where

relatively high projected rotational velocity of the star (vsini=40+/-5 km/s)
places CoRoT-11 among the most rapidly rotating planet host stars discovered so
far. With a planetary mass of mp=2.33+/-0.34 Mjup and radius rp=1.43+/-0.03
Rjup, the resulting mean density of CoRoT-11b (rho=0.99+/-0.15 g/cm^3) can be
explained with a model for an inflated hydrogen-planet with a solar composition
and a high level of energy dissipation in its interior.

observations in the most disc dominated states show a variation of the disc
luminosity with temperature close to L ~\propto T^4. This in turn implies that
in these states, the disc radius, R_in, and the colour correction factor,
f_col, are almost constant. Deviations away from the T^4 law are observed at
the beginning and end of the most disc dominated states, during the
intermediate states. Although these could be explained by an inward motion of
the accretion disc, they are more likely to be the result of an increase in the
value of f_col as the disc fraction decreases. By comparing the expected and
observed disc luminosities, we place approximate limits on the allowed
distances and masses of the BHXRB system. In a number of cases, the measured
distances and masses of the BHXRB system indicate that it is possible that the
black hole may be spinning.

the utility function defined as the sum logarithm throughput of all users has
been shown to guarantee proportional fairness. However, to acquire the channel
quality information may consume substantial amount of resources. In this work,
it is assumed that probing the quality of each user's channel takes a fraction
of the coherence time, so that the amount of time for data transmission is
reduced. The multiuser diversity gain does not always increase as the number of
users increases. In case the statistics of the channel quality is available to
the controller, the problem of sequential channel probing for user scheduling
is formulated as an optimal stopping time problem. A joint channel probing and
proportional fair scheduling scheme is developed. This scheme is extended to
the case where the channel statistics are not available to the controller, in

studying a generalized bandit problem. Numerical results demonstrate that the

XMM-Newton, Swift, and Fermi. We analyse these data with particular attention
to the calibration of Swift UV data, and apply a helical jet model to interpret
the source broad-band variability. The GASP-WEBT observations show an optical
flare in 2008 February-March, and oscillations of several tenths of mag on a
few-day time scale afterwards. The radio flux is only mildly variable. The UV
data from both XMM-Newton and Swift seem to confirm a UV excess that is likely
caused by thermal emission from the accretion disc. The X-ray data from
XMM-Newton indicate a strongly concave spectrum, as well as moderate flux
variability on an hour time scale. The Swift X-ray data reveal fast (interday)
flux changes, not correlated with those observed at lower energies. We compare
the spectral energy distribution (SED) corresponding to the 2008 low-brightness
state, which was characterised by a synchrotron dominance, to the 1997 outburst
state, where the inverse-Compton emission was prevailing. A fit with an
inhomogeneous helical jet model suggests that two synchrotron components are at
work with their self inverse-Compton emission. Most likely, they represent the
radiation from two distinct emitting regions in the jet. We show that the
difference between the source SEDs in 2008 and 1997 can be explained in terms
of pure geometrical variations. The outburst state occurred when the
jet-emitting regions were better aligned with the line of sight, producing an
increase of the Doppler beaming factor. Our analysis demonstrates that the jet
geometry can play an extremely important role in the BL Lacertae flux and
spectral variability.

parameters of fashionable items: (1) their innate utility; (2) individual
boredom associated with repeated usage of an item; and (3) social influences
associated with the preferences from other people. While there are several
works that emphasize the effect of social influence in understanding fashion
trends, in this paper we show how boredom plays a strong role in both
individual and social choices. We show how boredom can be used to explain the
cyclic choices in several scenarios such as an individual who has to pick a
restaurant to visit every day, or a society that has to repeatedly `vote' on a
single fashion style from a collection. We formally show that a society that
votes for a single fashion style can be viewed as a single individual cycling
through different choices.
  In our model, the utility of an item gets discounted by the amount of boredom
that has accumulated over the past; this boredom increases with every use of
the item and decays exponentially when not used. We address the problem of
optimally choosing items for usage, so as to maximize over-all satisfaction,
i.e., composite utility, over a period of time. First we show that the simple
greedy heuristic of always choosing the item with the maximum current composite
utility can be arbitrarily worse than the optimal. Second, we prove that even
with just a single individual, determining the optimal strategy for choosing
items is NP-hard. Third, we show that a simple modification to the greedy
algorithm that simply doubles the boredom of each item is a provably close

two regimes with different theta dependence, one behaving as a dilute instanton

gamma-ray source is inflected with a relatively steep spectral region matching
between the flatter spectrum found at both low and high energies. We seek to
model the gamma-ray production in the inner 10 pc of the Galaxy and examine, in
particular, cosmic ray (CR) proton propagation scenarios that reproduce the
observed spectrum of the central source. We show that a model that instantiates
a transition from diffusive propagation of the CR protons at low energy to
almost rectilinear propagation at high energies (given a reasonable
energy-dependence of the assumed diffusion coefficient) can well explain the
spectral phenomenology. In general, however, we find considerable degeneracy
between different parameter choices which will only be broken with the addition
of morphological information that gamma-ray telescopes cannot deliver given

face centered cubic Ag nanoislands grow with a predominant epitaxial
orientation [1 -1 0]Ag || [1 -1 0]Si, (111)Ag || (111)Si along with its twin

of Ag on Si(111) surfaces. The twins are thus rotated by a 180{\deg} rotation
of the Ag unit cell about the Si [111] axis. It is intriguing that Ag
nanoislands follow an epitaxial relationship with the Si(111) substrate in
spite of the presence of a 2-3 nm thick oxide layer between Ag and Si.

from high-energy electrons accelerated in internal shocks. Fast synchrotron
cooling predicts that the photon index below the spectral peak is alpha=-3/2.
This differs significantly from the observed median value alpha \approx -1. We
quantify the influence of inverse Compton and adiabatic cooling on alpha to
understand whether these processes can reconcile the observations with a
synchrotron origin. We use a time-dependent code that follows both the shock
dynamics and electron energy losses. We investigate the dependence of alpha on
the parameters of the model. Slopes between -3/2 and -1 are reached when
electrons suffer IC losses in the Klein-Nishina regime. This does not
necessarily imply a strong IC component in the Fermi/LAT range because
scatterings are only moderately efficient. Steep slopes require that a large
fraction (10-30%) of the dissipated energy is given to a small fraction (<~1%)
of the electrons and that the magnetic energy density fraction remains low (<~
0.1%). Values of alpha up to -2/3 can be obtained with relatively high
radiative efficiencies (>50%) when adiabatic cooling is comparable with
radiative cooling (marginally fast cooling). This requires collisions at small
radii and/or with low magnetic fields. Amending the standard fast cooling
scenario to account for IC cooling naturally leads to alpha up to -1.
Marginally fast cooling may also account for alpha up to -2/3, although the
conditions required are more difficult to reach. About 20% of GRBs show spectra
with slopes alpha>-2/3. Other effects, not investigated here, such as a thermal
component in the electron distribution or pair production by HE photons may
further affect alpha. Still, the majority of observed GRB prompt spectra can be
reconciled with a synchrotron origin, constraining the microphysics of mildly
relativistic internal shocks.

manifolds of $N$ landmarks (or feature points) in D dimensions, endowed with
the Riemannian metric induced by the group action of diffeomorphisms. The
inverse of the metric tensor for these manifolds (i.e. the cometric), when
written in coordinates, is such that each of its elements depends on at most 2D
of the ND coordinates. This makes the matrices of partial derivatives of the
cometric very sparse in nature, thus suggesting solving the highly non-trivial
problem of developing a formula that expresses sectional curvature in terms of
the cometric and its first and second partial derivatives (we call this Mario's
formula). We apply such formula to the manifolds of landmarks and in particular
we fully explore the case of geodesics on which only two points have non-zero
momenta and compute the sectional curvatures of 2-planes spanned by the

inhomogeneous stochastic gossip process of continuous opinion dynamics in a
society consisting of two types of agents: regular agents, who update their
beliefs according to information that they receive from their social neighbors;
and stubborn agents, who never update their opinions. When the society contains
stubborn agents with different opinions, the belief dynamics never lead to a
consensus (among the regular agents). Instead, beliefs in the society fail to
converge almost surely, the belief profile keeps on fluctuating in an ergodic
fashion, and it converges in law to a non-degenerate random vector. The
structure of the network and the location of the stubborn agents within it
shape the opinion dynamics. The expected belief vector evolves according to an
ordinary differential equation coinciding with the Kolmogorov backward equation
of a continuous-time Markov chain with absorbing states corresponding to the
stubborn agents and converges to a harmonic vector, with every regular agent's
value being the weighted average of its neighbors' values, and boundary
conditions corresponding to the stubborn agents'. Expected cross-products of
the agents' beliefs allow for a similar characterization in terms of coupled
Markov chains on the network. We prove that, in large-scale societies which are
highly fluid, meaning that the product of the mixing time of the Markov chain
on the graph describing the social network and the relative size of the
linkages to stubborn agents vanishes as the population size grows large, a
condition of \emph{homogeneous influence} emerges, whereby the stationary
beliefs' marginal distributions of most of the regular agents have
approximately equal first and second moments.

dimension of the Hilbert space? The possible answers range from practical
limitations due to decoherence within quantum theory to fundamental limits due
to collapse models that modify quantum theory. Here, we suggest the viewpoint
that there might be also fundamental limits without altering the quantum laws.
We first demonstrate that for two quantum spins systems of a given spin length,
no violation of local realism can be observed, if the measurements are
sufficiently coarse-grained. Then we show that there exists a fundamental limit
for the precision of measurements due to (i) the Heisenberg uncertainty
relation which has to be applied to the measuring apparatus, (ii) relativistic
causality, and (iii) the finiteness of resources in any laboratory including
the whole universe. This suggests that there might exist a limit for the size
of the systems (dimension of the Hilbert space) above which no violation of

regardless of their distance, with arbitrary precision. EPR correlations give
rise to two fundamental notions: {\em nonlocal ``steering''} of the quantum
state of one object by measuring the other, and inseparability ({\em
entanglement}) of their quantum states. EPR entanglement is a resource of
quantum information (QI) and CV teleportation of light and matter waves. It has
lately been demonstrated for {\em collective} CV of distant thermal-gas clouds,
correlated by interaction with a common field. Here we demonstrate that
collective CV of two species of trapped ultracold bosonic gases can be
EPR-correlated (entangled) via {\em inherent} interactions between the species.

changes in the physical environments and in PAH feature radiances down to a

and (8.6 micron)/(6.2 micron) PAH radiance ratios are found to be independent
of position across all three galaxies, although the ratios do vary from galaxy
to galaxy. As seen in other galaxies, we find no variation in the grain size
distribution as a function of local radiation field strength. Absolute PAH
feature intensities as measured by a ratio of PAH/(24 micron) radiances are
seen to vary both positionally within a given galaxy, and from one galaxy to
another when integrated over the full observed extent of each system. We
examine direct comparisons of CC mode PAH ratios (7.7 micron)/(6.2 micron) and
(8.6 micron)/(6.2 micron) to the mixed (CC/CH) mode PAH ratio (7.7

of robust constraining the UV-to-X-ray emission continuum we selected only the
data corresponding to truly simultaneous time intervals between Swift and
Suzaku, allowing us to obtain a good-quality, broad-band spectrum despite a
modest length (0.6 ksec) exposure. We analyzed the spectrum with the parametric
forward-fitting SYNCHROTRON model implemented in XSPEC assuming two different
representations of the underlying electron energy distribution, both well
motivated by the current particle acceleration models: a power-law distribution
above the minimum energy $\gamma_{\rm min}$ with an exponential cutoff at the
maximum energy $\gamma_{\rm max}$, and a modified ultra-relativistic Maxwellian
with an equilibrium energy $\gamma_{\rm eq}$. We found that the latter implies
unlikely physical conditions within the blazar zone of Mrk 421. On the other
hand, the exponentially moderated power-law electron distribution gives two
possible sets of the model parameters: (i) flat spectrum $dN'_e/d\gamma \propto
\gamma^{-1.91}$ with low minimum electron energy $\gamma_{\rm min}<10^3$, and
(ii) steep spectrum $\propto \gamma^{-2.77}$ with high minimum electron energy
$\gamma_{\rm min}\simeq 2\times10^4$. We discuss different interpretations of
both possibilities in the context of a diffusive acceleration of electrons at
relativistic, sub- or superluminal shocks. We also comment on how exactly the

We found that irregularities in the local structure of cleaved mica surface
provide different mechanisms for the mica-graphene binding. By assuming
electroneutrality for both surfaces, the binding is mainly of vdW nature,
barely exceeding thermal energy per carbon atom at room temperature. In
contrast, if potassium atoms are non uniformly distributed on mica, the
different regions of the surface give rise to $n$- or $p$-type doping of
graphene. In turn, an additional interaction arises between the surfaces,
significantly increasing the adhesion. For each case the electronic states of
graphene remain unaltered by the adhesion. It is expected, however, that the
Fermi level of graphene supported on realistic mica could be shifted relative
to the Dirac point due to asymmetry in the charge doping. Obtained variations
of the distance between graphene and mica for different regions of the surface
are found to be consistent with recent atomic force microscopy experiments. A
relative flatness of mica and the absence of interlayer covalent bonding in the

outside. This observation reveals that the role of the MD essentially is to
drive the whole work substance being off equilibrium, or equivalently working

J051306.40-690946.3) is a carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star for
which we have photometry and spectra from the Spitzer SAGE and SAGE-Spec
programs along with UBVIJHK_s photometry. By modeling this source, we obtain a
baseline set of dust properties to be used in the construction of a grid of
models for carbon stars. We reproduce its spectral energy distribution using a
mixture of AmC and SiC (15% by mass). The grain sizes are distributed according
to the KMH model. The best-fit model has an optical depth of 0.28 for the shell
at the peak of the SiC feature, with R_in~1430 R_sun or 4.4 R_star. The
temperature at this inner radius is 1310 K. Assuming an expansion velocity of
10 km s^-1, we obtain a dust mass-loss rate of 2.5x10^-9 M_sun yr-1. We
calculate a 15% variation in this rate by testing the fit sensitivity against
variation in input parameters. We also present a simple model for the molecular
gas in the extended atmosphere that could give rise to the 13.7 \mu m feature
seen in the spectrum. We find that a combination of CO and C_2H_2 gas at an
excitation temperature of about 1000 K and column densities of 3x10^21 cm^-2
and 10^19 cm^-2 respectively are able to reproduce the observations. Given that
the excitation temperature is close to T_dust(R_in), most of the molecular
contribution probably arises from the inner shell region. The luminosity
corresponding to the first epoch of SAGE observations is 6580 L_sun. For an
effective temperature of about 3000 K, this implies a stellar mass of 1.5-2
M_sun and an age of 1-2.5 Gyr. For a gas:dust ratio of 200, we obtain a gas
mass-loss rate of 5.0x10^-7 M_sun yr^-1, consistent with the gas mass-loss
rates estimated from the period, color and 8 \mu m flux of the source.

attention as probes of cold and depleted dense molecular cloud cores. These
ions are at the basis of molecular deuterium fractionation, a common
characteristic observed in star forming regions. H2D+ is now routinely
observed, but the search for its isotopologue D2H+ is still difficult because
of the high frequency of its ground para transition (692 GHz). Aims: We have
observed molecular transitions of H2D+ and D2H+ in a cold prestellar core to
characterize the roots of deuterium chemistry. Methods: Thanks to the sensitive
multi-pixel CHAMP+ receiver on the APEX telescope where the required excellent
weather conditions are met, we not only successfully detect D2H+ in the H-MM1
prestellar core located in the L1688 cloud, but also obtain information on the
spatial extent of its emission. We also detect H2D+ at 372 GHz in the same
source. We analyse these detections using a non-LTE radiative transfer code and
a state-of-the-art spin-dependent chemical model. Results: This observation is
the first secure detection of D2H+ in space. The emission is moreover extended
over several pixels of the CHAMP+ array, i.e. on a scale of at least 40'',
corresponding to ~ 4800 AU. We derive column densities on the order of
1e12-1e13 cm-2 for both molecules in the LTE approximation depending on the
assumed temperature, and up to two orders of magnitude higher based on a
non-LTE analysis. Conclusions: Our modeling suggests that the level of CO
depletion must be extremely high (>10, and even >100 if the temperature of the
core is around 10 K) at the core center, in contradiction with CO depletion
levels directly measured in other cores. Observation of the H2D+ spatial
distribution and direct measurement of the CO depletion in H-MM1 will be
essential to confirm if present chemical models investigating the basis of

objects to show a quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) in its power spectrum.
Previous analysis of this signal identified it with the well-studied type C
low-frequency QPO (LFQPO) seen in black hole binaries (BHBs), implying an
intermediate mass black hole (IMBH). However, in BHBs this QPO has a centroid
frequency which scales tightly with the position of the low-frequency break in
the broad band power spectrum. We use this relation to predict the frequency of
the power spectral break in NGC 5408 X-1, and show that this is inconsistent
with the break frequencies in both available, archival XMM-Newton observations.
Thus the broad band power spectral shape does not support this identification
of the QPO. The energy spectra also do not support an IMBH interpretation. They
can be fit by a two-component model, best described by soft thermal emission at
low energies, together with low-temperature, optically thick Comptonisation
producing a tail which dominates above 2 keV. The parameters of the tail are
unlike those seen in any of the sub-Eddington BHB spectral states. The energy
dependent variability supports this deconvolution, as it is consistent with the
soft thermal component below 2 keV diluting extreme variability of the high
energy tail. The only objects with similar spectra which have similar amounts
of variability are the BHB, GRS 1915+105, and some extreme NLS1s. This suggests
that NGC 5408 X-1 is in a similar super-Eddington state, placing a natural
limit on the mass of < 100 solar masses. Its QPO could then be similar to the
ultra-LFQPO seen occasionally in GRS 1915+105, consistent with a large stellar
mass black hole. We suggest a model geometry which may explain the spectra and
variability of highly super-Eddington sources.

density although they have different properties. This coincidence can be
elegantly explained if the dark matter relic density, originating from a dark
matter asymmetry, is fully determined by the baryon asymmetry. Thus the dark
matter mass is not arbitrary, rather becomes predictive. We realize this
scenario in baryon(lepton) number conserving models where two or more neutral
singlet scalars decay into two or three baryonic(leptonic) dark matter scalars,
and also decay into quarks(leptons) through other on-shell and/or off-shell

several disks around young stars. Radially resolved images of grain growth in
circumstellar disks are believed to be a powerful tool to constrain the dust
evolution models and the initial stage for the formation of planets. In this
paper we attempt to provide these constraints for the disk surrounding the
young star CQ Tau. This system was already suggested from previous studies to
host a population of grains grown to large sizes. We present new high angular
resolution (0.3-0.9 arcsec) observations at wavelengths from 850um to 3.6cm
obtained at the SMA, IRAM-PdBI and NRAO-VLA interferometers. We perform a
combined analysis of the spectral energy distribution and of the
high-resolution images at different wavelengths using a model to describe the
dust thermal emission from the circumstellar disk. We include a prescription
for the gas emission from the inner regions of the system. We detect the
presence of evolved dust by constraining the disk averaged dust opacity
coefficient beta (computed between 1.3 and 7mm) to be 0.6+/-0.1. This confirms
the earlier suggestions that the disk contains dust grains grown to significant
sizes and puts this on firmer grounds by tightly constraining the gas
contamination to the observed fluxes at mm-cm wavelengths. We report some
evidence of radial variations in dust properties, but current resolution and
sensitivity are still too low for definitive results.

path-integral framework. To allow for the formation of the
Fulde-Ferell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov-state (FFLO-state), a suitable form of the
saddle-point is chosen, in which the pairs have a finite centre-of-mass
momentum. To test the correctness of this path-integral description, the
zero-temperature phase diagram for an imbalanced Fermi gas in three dimensions
is calculated, and compared to recent theoretical results. Subsequently, we
investigate two models that describe the effect of imposing a one-dimensional
optical potential on the 3D imbalanced Fermi gas. We show that this 1D optical
potential can greatly enlarge the stability region of the FFLO-state, relative
to the case of the 3D Fermi gas without 1D periodic modulation. Furthermore it
is show that there exists a direct connection between the centre-of-mass
momentum of the FFLO-pairs and the wavevector of the optical potential. We
propose that this concept can be used experimentally to resonantly enhance the
stability region of the FFLO-state.

anisotropy maps obtained by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP)
mission, and plays a key role throughout the data processing. Previously, we
discovered a timing asynchronism of -25.6ms between the timestamps of the
spacecraft attitude and radiometer output in the original raw WMAP time-ordered
data (TOD), which, if not corrected in following data processing, would
generate an artificial quadrupole component (l=2) in recovered CMB maps (Liu,
Xiong & Li 2010). Recently, Roukema (2010b) proves that there does exist a
timing-offset-induced error corresponding to about -25.6ms in the WMAP
calibrated TOD by studying the fluctuation variance per pixel in the
temperature map recovered from the TOD as a function of assumed timing-offset.
Here, we find evidence directly in the WMAP TOD for such an uncorrected timing
error, possibly occurred in calculating the Doppler dipole signal during the
WMAP team's TOD data processing. The amplitude is highly significant and is
consistent with previous work. We also show that the uncorrected timing-offset
can lead the WMAP CMB quadrupole to be substantially overestimated.

orbit (AGIS-LEO). Gravitational waves can be observed by comparing a pair of
atom interferometers separated over a ~30 km baseline. In the proposed
configuration, one or three of these interferometer pairs are simultaneously
operated through the use of two or three satellites in formation flight. The
three satellite configuration allows for the increased suppression of multiple
noise sources and for the detection of stochastic gravitational wave signals.
The mission will offer a strain sensitivity of < 10^(-18) / Hz^(1/2) in the 50
mHz - 10 Hz frequency range, providing access to a rich scientific region with
substantial discovery potential. This band is not currently addressed with the
LIGO or LISA instruments. We analyze systematic backgrounds that are relevant
to the mission and discuss how they can be mitigated at the required levels.
Some of these effects do not appear to have been considered previously in the
context of atom interferometry, and we therefore expect that our analysis will
be broadly relevant to atom interferometric precision measurements. Finally, we
present a brief conceptual overview of shorter-baseline (< 100 m) atom
interferometer configurations that could be deployed as proof-of-principle
instruments on the International Space Station (AGIS-ISS) or an independent
satellite.

Specifically, we consider membranes made of macroscopic matter with maximally
symmetric distribution of spin. In the narrow membrane limit, the dimensionally
reduced theory is obtained. It describes how effective strings couple to the
effective $D$-dimensional geometry. The striking coincidence with the string
theory $\sigma$-model is observed. In this correspondence, the string
background fields $G_{\mu\nu}$, $B_{\mu\nu}$, $A_{\mu}$ and $\Phi$ are related
to the metric and torsion of the Riemann-Cartan spacetime.

type stars from a list of Fe line equivalent widths. The solution should verify
3 conditions in the standard method: ionization equilibrium, excitation
equilibrium and independence between metallicity and equivalent widths. We
added the condition that the input metallicity of the model atmosphere should
be similar to the output metallicity derived with equivalent widths.
Solar-scaled Kurucz model atmospheres with NEWODF opacities are calculated with
an independent program. Parameter files control different details, such as the
mixing-length parameter, the overshooting, the damping of the lines and the
weight factors in the definition of the chi2 function. FUNDPAR derive the
uncertainties following 2 methods: the criteria of Gonzalez & Vanture (1998)
and the dispersion using the chi2 function. The code use the 2009 version of
the MOOG program. The results derived with FUNDPAR are in agreement with
previous determinations in the literature. In particular we obtained the
fundamental parameters of 58 exoplanet host stars. The program is freely
available from the web (http://icate-conicet.gob.ar/saffe/fundpar/).
