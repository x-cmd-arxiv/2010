each transmit/receive node is equipped with no more than two antennas. Finally,

those states most relevant in communication scenarios. We show that for this
class of states, entanglement swapping adds no additional mixedness, that is
the ensemble average output state has the same purity as the input states. This
implies that, by using intermediate entanglement swapping steps, it is, in
principle, possible to distribute entangled two-mode Gaussian states of higher
purity as compared to direct transmission. We then apply the general results on
optimal Gaussian swapping to the problem of quantum communication over a lossy
fiber and demonstrate that, contrary to negative conclusions in the literature,
swapping-based schemes in fact often perform better than direct transmission
for high input squeezing. However, an effective transmission analysis reveals
that the hope for improved performance based on optimal Gaussian entanglement
swapping is spurious since the swapping does not lead to an enhancement of the
effective transmission. This implies that the same or better results can always
be obtained using direct transmission in combination with, in general, less
squeezing.

Inflation effective theory predicts a tensor to scalar ratio 0.05-0.04 at
reach/border line of next CMB observations, early fast-roll inflation provides
lowest multipoles depression. SZ amplitudes are smaller than expected: CMB and
X-ray data agree but intracluster models need revision and relaxed/non-relaxed
clusters distinction. (ii) cosmic ray positron excess is explained naturally by
astrophysical processes, annihilating/decaying dark matter needs growing
tailoring. (iii) Cored (non cusped) DM halos and warm (keV scale mass) DM are
increasingly favored from theory and observations, naturally producing observed
small scale structures, wimps turn strongly disfavoured. LambdaWDM 1 keV
simulations well reproduce observations. Evidence that LambdaCDM does not work
at small scales is staggering. P Biermann presents his live minutes of the
Colloquium and concludes that a keV sterile neutrino is the most interesting DM
candidate. Photos of the Colloquium are included.

the usual Aharonov-Bohm effects (magnetic or electric). (i) Application to
cases of particles passing through static magnetic or electric fields leads to
cancellations of Aharonov-Bohm phases at the observation point; these are
linked to behaviors at the semiclassical level (to the old Werner & Brill
experimental observations, or their ""electric analogs"" - or to recent reports
of Batelaan & Tonomura) but are shown to be far more general (true not only for

using these cancellations, certain previously unnoticed sign-errors in the
literature are corrected. (ii) Application to time-dependent situations
provides a remedy for erroneous results in the literature (on improper uses of

a field-nonlocal part: their competition is shown to recover Relativistic
Causality in earlier ""paradoxes"" (such as the van Kampen thought-experiment),
while a more general consideration indicates that the temporal nonlocalities
found here demonstrate in part a causal propagation of phases of quantum

E' between G_1-I and G_2-I such that G_1 \cup G_2 \cup E' is an interval graph.
  Simultaneous representation problems are related to simultaneous planar
embeddings, and have applications in any situation where it is desirable to
consistently represent two related graphs, for example: interval graphs
capturing overlaps of DNA fragments of two similar organisms; or graphs
connected in time, where one is an updated version of the other.
  In this paper we give an O(n^2*logn) time algorithm for recognizing
simultaneous interval graphs,where n = |G_1 \cup G_2|. This result complements
the polynomial time algorithms for recognizing probe interval graphs and
provides an efficient algorithm for the interval graph sandwich problem for the
special case where the set of optional edges induce a complete bipartite graph.

available for GOODS-South galaxies to measure their photometric redshifts. The
photometry includes VLT/VIMOS (U-band), HST/ACS (F435W, F606W, F775W, and
F850LP bands), VLT/ISAAC (J-, H-, and Ks-bands), and four Spitzer/IRAC channels
(3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 micron). The catalog is selected in the z-band (F850LP)
and photometry in each band is carried out using the recently completed TFIT
algorithm, which performs PSF matched photometry uniformly across different
instruments and filters, despite large variations in PSFs and pixel scales.
Photometric redshifts are derived using the GOODZ code, which is based on the
template fitting method using priors. The code also implements ""training"" of
the template SED set, using available spectroscopic redshifts in order to
minimize systematic differences between the templates and the SEDs of the
observed galaxies. Our final catalog covers an area of 153 sq. arcmin and
includes photometric redshifts for a total of 32,505 objects. The scatter
between our estimated photometric and spectroscopic redshifts is sigma=0.040
with 3.7% outliers to the full z-band depth of our catalog, decreasing to
sigma=0.039 and 2.1% outliers at a magnitude limit m(z)<24.5. This is
consistent with the best results previously published for GOODS-S galaxies,
however, the present catalog is the deepest yet available and provides
photometric redshifts for significantly more objects to deeper flux limits and
higher redshifts than earlier works. Furthermore, we show that the photometric
redshifts estimated here for galaxies selected as dropouts are consistent with
those expected based on the Lyman break technique.

to recover oscillations. This effect is useful only in a precise range of

large chemical potential of the order of the potential's amplitude, a strong

mark-recapture under heterogeneity (model M$_{h}$) presents two challenges: (i)
finding a flexible likelihood in which abundance appears as an explicit
parameter and (ii) fitting the hierarchical model for abundance. The first
challenge arises because abundance not only indexes the population size, it
also determines the dimension of the capture probabilities in heterogeneity
models. A common approach is to use data augmentation to include these capture
probabilities directly into the likelihood and fit the model using Bayesian
inference via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Two such examples of this
approach are (i) explicit trans-dimensional MCMC, and (ii) superpopulation data
augmentation. The superpopulation approach has the advantage of simple
specification that is easily implemented in BUGS and related software. However,
it reparameterizes the model so that abundance is no longer included, except as
a derived quantity. This is a drawback when hierarchical models for abundance,
or related parameters, are desired. Here, we analytically compare the two
approaches and show that they are more closely related than might appear
superficially. We exploit this relationship to specify the model in a way that
allows us to include abundance as a parameter and that facilitates hierarchical
modeling using readily available software such as BUGS. We use this approach to
model trends in grizzly bear abundance in Yellowstone National Park from
1986-1998.

between home and cellular users such that a specified minimum rate for each can
be achieved. The optimal such sharing fraction is derived. Analysis shows that
shared access achieves at least the overall throughput of open access while
also satisfying rate requirements, while closed access fails for cellular users
and open access fails for the home user.

probability of being nonzero. We propose a weighted $\ell_1$ minimization
recovery algorithm and analyze its performance using a Grassmann angle
approach. We compute explicitly the relationship between the system
parameters-the weights, the number of measurements, the size of the two sets,
the probabilities of being nonzero- so that when i.i.d. random Gaussian
measurement matrices are used, the weighted $\ell_1$ minimization recovers a
randomly selected signal drawn from the considered sparsity model with
overwhelming probability as the problem dimension increases. This allows us to
compute the optimal weights. We demonstrate through rigorous analysis and
simulations that for the case when the support of the signal can be divided
into two different subclasses with unequal sparsity fractions, the optimal
weighted $\ell_1$ minimization outperforms the regular $\ell_1$ minimization
substantially. We also generalize the results to an arbitrary number of

at least $\lfloor \log w \rfloor$ in time $O(\log W/w + k)$, and report $k$
highest-rank points in $R$ in time $O(\log\log n + \log W/w' + k)$, where

annihilation. As concrete examples, we calculate the effects of p-wave
annihilation (with the $v$-weighted cross section of $\sigma v=a+bv^2$) on the
mean intensity of extragalactic gamma rays produced in cosmological dark matter
halos. This velocity variation makes the shape of the energy spectrum harder,
but this change in the shape is too small to see unless $b/a\agt 10^6$. While
we find no such models in the parameter space of the Minimal Supersymmetric
Standard Model (MSSM), we show that it is possible to find $b/a\agt 10^6$ in
the extension MSSM$\otimes U(1)_{B-L}$. However, we find that the most dominant
effect of the p-wave annihilation is the suppression of the amplitude of the
gamma-ray background. A non-zero $b$ at the dark matter freeze-out epoch
requires a smaller value of $a$ in order for the relic density constraint to be
satisfied, suppressing the amplitude by a factor as low as $10^{-6}$ for a
thermal relic. Non-thermal relics will have weaker amplitude suppression. As
another velocity-dependent effect, we calculate the spectrum for s-wave
annihilation into fermions enhanced by the attractive Sommerfeld effect.
Resonances associated with this effect result in significantly enhanced
intensities, with a slightly softer energy spectrum.

The primary goal of the low surface brightness sample is to test our ability to
use morphological and surface brightness criteria to distinguish between Coma
Cluster members and background galaxies using high resolution HST/ACS images.
Candidates were rated as expected members, uncertain, or expected background.
From 93 spectra, 51 dwarf galaxy members and 20 background galaxies are
identified. Our morphological membership estimation success rate is ~100% for
objects expected to be members and better than ~90% for galaxies expected to be
in the background. We confirm that low surface brightness is a very good
indicator of cluster membership. High surface brightness galaxies are almost
always background with confusion arising only from the cases of the rare
compact elliptical galaxies. The more problematic cases occur at intermediate
surface brightness. Many of these galaxies are given uncertain membership
ratings, and these were found to be members about half of the time. Including
color information will improve membership determination but will fail for some
of the same objects that are already mis-identified when using only surface
brightness and morphology criteria. Compact elliptical galaxies with B-V colors
~0.2 magnitudes redward of the red sequence in particular require spectroscopic
follow-up. In a sample of 47 high surface brightness, UCD candidates, 19
objects have redshifts which place them in the Coma Cluster. Redshift

when one restricts to the n-torsion subgroup. This failure is however
relatively mild; we show that weak approximation holds outside a finite set of

that can be seen as an analog of the Grunwald-Wang theorem in class field
