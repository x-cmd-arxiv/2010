energy from the Sun to enter the food-chain on Earth. It is a remarkable
non-equilibrium process in which photons are converted to many-body excitations
which traverse a complex biomolecular membrane, getting captured and fueling
chemical reactions within a reaction-center in order to produce nutrients. The
precise nature of these dynamical processes -- which lie at the interface
between quantum and classical behaviour, and involve both noise and
coordination -- are still being explored. Here we focus on a striking recent
empirical finding concerning an illumination-driven transition in the
biomolecular membrane architecture of {\it Rsp. Photometricum} purple bacteria.
Using stochastic realisations to describe a hopping rate model for excitation
transfer, we show numerically and analytically that this surprising shift in
preferred architectures can be traced to the interplay between the excitation
kinetics and the reaction center dynamics. The net effect is that the bacteria
profit from efficient metabolism at low illumination intensities while using
dissipation to avoid an oversupply of energy at high illumination intensities.

geometrical model valid at unification scale, which offers a purely

phenomenological model of particle physics. Noncommutative geometry states that
close to the Planck energy scale, space-time has a fine structure and proposes
that it is given as the product of a four-dimensional continuum compact
Riemaniann manifold by a tiny discrete finite noncommutative space. The
spectral action principle, a universal action functional on spectral triples
which depends only on the spectrum of the Dirac operator, applied to this
almost commutative product geometry, leads to the full Standard Model,
including neutrino mixing which has Majorana mass terms and a see-saw
mechanism, minimally coupled to gravity. It also makes various predictions at
unification scale. I will review some of the phenomenological and cosmological
consequences of this beautiful and purely geometrical approach to unification.

queries return only the best answers, according to a given preference relation.
Preference queries are a fast growing area of database research. Skyline
queries constitute one of the most thoroughly studied classes of preference
queries. A well known limitation of skyline queries is that skyline preference
relations assign the same importance to all attributes. In this work, we study
p-skyline queries that generalize skyline queries by allowing varying attribute
importance in preference relations. We perform an in-depth study of the
properties of p-skyline preference relations. In particular,we study the
problems of containment and minimal extension. We apply the obtained results to
the central problem of the paper: eliciting relative importance of attributes.
Relative importance is implicit in the constructed p-skyline preference
relation. The elicitation is based on user-selected sets of superior (positive)
and inferior (negative) examples. We show that the computational complexity of
elicitation depends on whether inferior examples are involved. If they are not,
elicitation can be achieved in polynomial time. Otherwise, it is NP-complete.
Our experiments show that the proposed elicitation algorithm has high accuracy

density and of the Fe K{\alpha} emission line along the orbit and during the
eclipses. We also built a 3D model of the structure of the stellar wind to
reproduce the observed variability. We first derived a refined orbital solution
built from INTEGRAL, RXTE and XMM data. The XMM monitoring campaign revealed
significant variation of intrinsic absorbing column density along the orbit and
of the Fe K{\alpha} line equivalent width around the eclipses. The origin of
the soft X-ray absorption is modeled with an dense and extended hydrodynamical
tail, trailing the neutron star. This structure extends along most of the
orbit, indicating that the stellar wind is strongly disrupted by the neutron
star. The variability of the absorbing column density suggests that the
terminal velocity of the wind is smaller (~400 km/s) than observed in classical
systems. This can also explain the much stronger density perturbation inferred
from the observations. Most of the Fe K{\alpha} emission is generated in the
most inner region of the hydrodynamical tail. This region, that extends over a
few accretion radii, is ionized and does not contribute to the soft X-ray
absorption. We have built a qualitative model of the stellar wind of IGR
J17252-3616 that can represent the observations and suggest that highly
absorbed systems have a lower wind velocity than classical sgHMXB. This
proposal could be tested with de- tailed numerical simulations and
high-resolution infrared/optical observations. If confirmed, it may turn out
that half of the persistent sgHMXB have low stellar wind speeds.

emission that varies strongly around periastron, and non-thermal emission seen
in hard X-rays and gamma-rays.
  Aims: To definitively identify Eta Car as the source of the hard X-ray
emission, to examine how changes in the 2-10 keV band influence changes in the
hard X-ray band, and to understand more clearly the mechanisms producing the
non-thermal emission using new INTEGRAL observations obtained close to
periastron.
  Methods: A Chandra observation encompassing the ISGRI error circle was
analysed, and all other soft X-ray sources (including the outer shell of Eta
Car itself) were discarded as likely counter-parts. New hard X-ray images of
Eta Car were studied close to periastron, and compared to previous observations
far from periastron.
  Results: The INTEGRAL component, when represented by a power law (with a
photon index of 1.8), would produce more emission in the Chandra band than
observed from any point source in the ISGRI error circle apart from Eta Car, as
long as the hydrogen column density to the ISGRI source is lower than 1E24
cm^{-2}. Such sources are rare, thus the ISGRI emission is very likely to be
associated with Eta Car. The eventual contribution of the outer shell to the
non-thermal component also remains fairly limited. Close to periastron, a
3-sigma detection is achieved for the hard X-ray emission of Eta Car, with a
flux similar to the average value far from periastron.
  Conclusions: Assuming a single absorption component for both the thermal and
non-thermal sources, this detection can be explained with a hydrogen column
density that does not exceed 6E23 cm^{-2} without resorting to an intrinsic
increase in the hard X-ray emission. The energy injected in hard X-rays
(averaged over a month) appears rather constant as close as a few stellar
radii, well within the acceleration region of the wind.

the supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the Galactic center, noting the cases in
which the two stars would come close enough together to collide. In this paper
we replace the point-mass stars by fluid realizations, and use a
smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code to follow the close interactions. We
model the binary components as main-sequence stars with initial masses of 1, 3
and 6 Solar masses, and with chemical composition profiles taken from stellar
evolution codes. Outcomes of the close interactions include mergers, collisions
that leave both stars intact, and ejection of one star at high velocity
accompanied by capture of the other star into a tight orbit around the SMBH.
For the first time, we follow the evolution of the collision products for many
($\gtrsim 100$) orbits around the SMBH. Stars that are initially too small to
be tidally disrupted by the SMBH can be puffed up by close encounters or
collisions, with the result that tidal stripping occurs in subsequent periapse
passages. In these cases, mass loss occurs episodically, sometimes for hundreds
of orbits before the star is completely disrupted. Repeated tidal flares, of
either increasing or decreasing intensity, are a predicted consequence. In
collisions involving a low-mass and a high-mass star, the merger product
acquires a high core hydrogen abundance from the smaller star, effectively
resetting the nuclear evolution ""clock"" to a younger age. Elements like Li, Be
and B that can exist only in the outermost envelope of a star are severely
depleted due to envelope ejection during collisions and due to tidal forces
from the SMBH. In the absence of collisions, tidal spin-up of stars is only
important in a narrow range of periapse distances, $r_t/2\lesssim r_per
\lesssim r_t$ with $r_t$ the tidal disruption radius.

precisely those that are indexed by permutations that avoid the patterns 4231

study the case when W is the affine Weyl group of type A or the affine

two models with dynamical dark energy, viewed as a quintessence scalar field
(using a RP and a SUGRA potential form) and two extended quintessence models
(EQp and EQn) where the quintessence scalar field interacts non-minimally with
gravity (scalar-tensor theories). We adopted for all models the normalization
of the matter power spectrum $\sigma_{8}$ to match the CMB data. In the models
with dynamical dark energy and quintessence, we describe the equation of state
with $w_0\approx-0.9$, still within the range allowed by observations. For each
model, we have performed hydrodynamical simulations in a cosmological box of
$(300 \ {\rm{Mpc}} \ h^{-1})^{3}$ including baryons and allowing for cooling
and star formation. The contemporary presence of evolving dark energy and
baryon physics allows us to investigate the interplay between the different
background cosmology and the evolution of the luminous matter. Since cluster
baryon fraction can be used to constrain other cosmological parameters such as
$\Omega_{m}$, we also analyse how dark energy influences the baryon content of
galaxy clusters. We find that, in models with dynamical dark energy, the
evolving cosmological background leads to different star formation rates and
different formation histories of galaxy clusters, but the baryon physics is not
affected in a relevant way. We investigate several proxies of the cluster mass
function based on X-ray observables like temperature, luminosity, $M_{gas}$,

PIL depending on the local field configuration. We distinguish the evolution of
the HXR source motion in four phases and associate each of them with distinct
regions of coronal magnetic fields as reconstructed using a non-linear
force-free field extrapolation. It is found that the magnetic reconnection
proceeds along the PIL toward the regions where the overlying field decreases

effective and accurate algorithms for similar tasks using ultra-massive data
sets and complex (natural or synthetic) dynamical systems. We propose a novel
principled approach to feature extraction in hybrid architectures comprised of
humans and machines in networked communication, who collaborate to solve a
pre-assigned pattern recognition (feature extraction) task. There are two
practical considerations addressed below: (1) Human experts, such as plant
biologists or astronomers, often use their visual perception and other implicit
prior knowledge or expertise without any obvious constraints to search for the
significant features, whereas machines are limited to a pre-programmed set of
criteria to work with; (2) in a team collaboration of collective problem
solving, the human experts have diverse abilities that are complementary, and
they learn from each other to succeed in cognitively complex tasks in ways that
are still impossible imitate by machines.

including the existence of pure Mott phases and highly populated condensates.
In this paper we show that the ODC method can also lead to temperatures that
are smaller than with the conventional DC method, depending on the control

hard-core case, then we extend our results to the soft-core case by performing
quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations for both DC and ODC systems at fixed

density structures, which is the result of their interaction with the
structured solar wind and with previous eruptions. ICMEs are revealed by in
situ measurements and in the past five years, through remote-sensing
observations by heliospheric imagers. However, to understand and analyze these
observations often requires the use of numerical modeling. It is because no
instruments can yet provide a simple view of ICMEs in two or three dimensions.
Numerical simulations can be used to determine the origin of a complex ejecta
observed near Earth, or to analyze the origin, speed and extent of density
structures observed remotely. Here, we review and discuss recent efforts to use
numerical simulations of ICMEs to investigate the magnetic topology, density
structure, energetics and kinematics of ICMEs in the interplanetary space.
  After reviewing existing numerical models of ICMEs, we first focus on
numerical modeling in support of the SMEI and STEREO observations. 3-D
simulations can help determining the origins of the fronts observed by SECCHI
and SMEI, especially for complex events such as the January 24-25, 2007 CMEs.
They can also be used to test different methods to derive ICME properties from
remote observations, to predict and explain observational effects, and to
understand the deceleration and deformation of ICMEs. In the last part, we
focus on the numerical investigation of non-magnetic cloud ejecta. We discuss
how simulations are crucial to understand the formation of non-twisted ejecta
and the formation of complex ejecta due to the interaction of multiple ICMEs.

previously known with certainty and that the entire MS and Leading Arm (LA)

square degree, 21-cm survey at the MS-tip to substantiate the continuity of the
MS between the Hulsbosch & Wakker data and the MS-like emission reported by
Braun & Thilker. Our survey, in combination with the Arecibo survey by
Stanimirovic et al., shows that the MS gas is continuous in this region and
that the MS is at least ~140 degrees long. We identify a new filament on the
eastern side of the MS that significantly deviates from the equator of the MS
coordinate system for more than ~45 degrees. Additionally, we find a previously
unknown velocity inflection in the MS-tip near MS longitude L_MS=-120 degrees
at which the velocity reaches a minimum and then starts to increase. We find
that five compact high velocity clouds cataloged by de Heij et al. as well as
Wright's Cloud are plausibly associated with the MS because they match the MS
in position and velocity. The mass of the newly-confirmed ~40 degree extension
of the MS-tip is ~2x10^7 Msun (d/120 kpc)^2 (including Wright's Cloud increases
this by ~50%) and increases the total mass of the MS by ~4%. However, projected
model distances of the MS at the tip are generally quite large and, if true,
indicate that the mass of the extension might be as large as ~10^8 Msun. From
our combined map of the entire MS, we find that the total column density
(integrated transverse to the MS) drops markedly along the MS and follows an
exponential decline with L_MS. We estimate that the age of the ~140 degree-long
MS is ~2.5 Gyr which coincides with bursts of star formation in the Magellanic
Clouds and a possible close encounter of these two galaxies with each other
that could have triggered the formation of the MS. [Abridged]

they allow us to construct a nearly stellar mass-limited sample down to ~

sample with two indicators, namely, the Spitzer/MIPS 24um flux and the
rest-frame 2800A luminosity. The SFR distribution at a fixed Mstar shifts to
higher values with increasing redshift at 0.5<z<3.5. More massive galaxies show
stronger evolution of SFR at z>~1. We found galaxies at 2.5<z<3.5 show a
bimodality in their SSFR distribution, which can be divided into two
populations by a constant SSFR of ~2 Gyr^{-1}. Galaxies in the low-SSFR group
have SSFRs of ~ 0.5-1.0 Gyr^{-1}, while the high-SSFR population shows ~10
Gyr^{-1}. The cosmic SFRD is dominated by galaxies with Mstar = 10^{10-11} Msun
at 0.5<z<3.5, while the contribution of massive galaxies with Mstar =
10^{11-11.5} Msun shows a strong evolution at z>1 and becomes significant at
z~3, especially in the case with the SFR based on MIPS 24um. In galaxies with
Mstar = 10^{10-11.5} Msun, those with a relatively narrow range of SSFR (<~1
dex) dominates the cosmic SFRD at 0.5<z<3.5. The SSFR of galaxies which
dominate the SFRD systematically increases with redshift. At 2.5<z<3.5, the
high-SSFR population, which is relatively small in number, dominates the SFRD.
Major star formation in the universe at higher redshift seems to be associated

properties of the redshift 3.036 sightline, giving perhaps the most detailed
information on the ultraviolet continuum absorption properties of any sightline

modeled by any ordinary extinction template (including the average Milky Way,
Large Magellanic Cloud, and Small Magellanic Cloud curves), partially because
the 2175-Angstrom feature (while present) is weaker by about a factor of two
than when seen under similar circumstances locally. However, the spectral
energy distribution is exquisitely fitted by the more general Fitzpatrick &
Massa (1990) parameterization of Local-Group extinction, putting it in the same
family as some peculiar Milky Way extinction curves. After correcting for this

described a simulation of neutron star evolution in phase space in the Galaxy,
taking into account the distribution of the progenitors and the kick at

stars and black holes adding a bulge component. From the new distributions we
calculate the microlensing optical depth, event rate and distribution of event
time scales, comparing and contrasting the case of ICoRs and ""normal stars"". We
find that the contribution of remnants to optical depth is slightly lower than
without kinematics, owing to the evaporation from the Galaxy. On the other
hand, the relative contribution to the rate of events is a factor $\sim\,5$
higher. In all, $\sim\,6-7$ percent of the events are likely related to ICoRs.
In particular, $\sim\,30-40$ percent of the events with duration $>\,100$ days

pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars in star-forming regions in the Magellanic Clouds,
accounting simultaneously for photometric errors, unresolved binarity,
differential extinction, stellar variability, accretion and crowding. The
application of the method is performed with the statistical construction of
synthetic color-magnitude diagrams using PMS evolutionary models. We convert
each isochrone into 2D probability distributions of artificial PMS stars in the
CMD by applying the aforementioned biases that dislocate these stars from their
original CMD positions. A maximum-likelihood technique is then applied to
derive the probability for each observed star to have a certain age, as well as
the best age for the entire cluster. We apply our method to the photometric
catalog of ~2000 PMS stars in the young association LH 95 in the LMC, based on
the deepest HST/ACS imaging ever performed toward this galaxy, with a detection
limit of V~28, corresponding to M~0.2 Msun. Our treatment shows that the age
determination is very sensitive to the considered grid of evolutionary models
and the assumed binary fraction. The age of LH 95 is found to vary from 2.8 Myr
to 4.4 Myr, depending on these factors. Our analysis allows us to disentangle a
real age-spread from the apparent CMD-broadening caused by the physical and
observational biases. We find that LH 95 hosts an age-spread well represented
by a gaussian distribution with a FWHM of the order of 2.8 Myr to 4.2 Myr
depending on the model and binary fraction. We detect a dependence of the
average age of the system with stellar mass. This dependence does not appear to
have any physical meaning, being rather due to imperfections of the PMS

seek to understand what the dust contents, ages and stellar masses of the

other redshifts. The candidates here are shown to have different properties
from those of Ly-alpha emitters found at higher redshift, by fitting the
spectral energy distributions (SEDs) using a Monte-Carlo Markov-Chain technique
and including nebular emission in the spectra. The stellar masses, and possibly
the dust contents, are higher, with stellar masses in the range log M_* = 8.5 -
11.0 M_sun and A_V = 0.0 - 2.5 mag. Young population ages are well constrained,
but the ages of older populations are typically unconstrained. In 15% of the
galaxies only a single, young population of stars is observed. We show that the
Ly-alpha fluxes of the best fit galaxies are correlated with their dust
properties, with higher dust extinction in Ly-alpha faint galaxies. Testing for
whether results derived from a light-weighted stack of objects correlate to
those found when fitting individual objects we see that stellar masses are
robust to stacking, but ages and especially dust extinctions are derived
incorrectly from stacks. We conclude that the stellar properties of Ly-alpha
emitters at z = 2.25 are different from those at higher redshift and that they
are diverse. Ly-alpha selection appears to be tracing systematically different
galaxies at different redshifts.

energy perturbations in the linear regime. We find that the introduction of a
finite sound speed into the picture necessarily induces a scale-dependence in
the dark energy clustering, which in turn affects the dynamics of the spherical
collapse in a scale-dependent way. As with other, more conventional fluids, we
can define a Jeans scale for the dark energy clustering, and hence a Jeans mass
M_J for the dark matter which feels the effect of dark energy clustering via
gravitational interactions. For bound objects (halos) with masses M >> M_J, the
effect of dark energy clustering is maximal. For those with M << M_J, the dark
energy component is effectively homogeneous, and its role in the formation of
these structures is reduced to its effects on the Hubble expansion rate. To
compute quantitatively the virial density and the linearly extrapolated
threshold density, we use a quasi-linear approach which is expected to be valid
up to around the Jeans mass. We find an interesting dependence of these
quantities on the halo mass M, given some w and c_s. The dependence is the
strongest for masses lying in the vicinity of M ~ M_J. Observing this
M-dependence will be a tell-tale sign that dark energy is dynamic, and a great
leap towards pinning down its clustering properties.

100cm^3 or 300cm^3. Besides, the turbulence is varied between Mach 1.5 and Mach
12.5 and the main driving scale between 1pc and 8pc. We vary the ionizing flux
by an order of magnitude. In our simulations the ionizing radiation enhances
the initial turbulent density distribution and thus leads to the formation of
pillar-like structures observed adjacent to HII regions in a natural way.
Gravitational collapse occurs regularly at the tips of the structures. We find
a clear correlation between the initial state of the turbulent cold cloud and
the final morphology and physical properties of the structures formed. The most
favorable regime for the formation of pillars is Mach 4-10. Structures and
therefore stars only form if the initial density contrast between the high
density unionized gas and the gas that is going to be ionized is lower than the
temperature contrast between the hot and the cold gas. The density of the
resulting pillars is determined by a pressure equilibrium between the hot and
the cold gas. A thorough analysis of the simulations shows that the complex
kinematical and geometrical structure of the formed elongated filaments
reflects that of observed pillars to an impressive level of detail. In
addition, we find that the observed line-of sight velocities allow for a
distinct determination of different formation mechanisms. Comparing the current

the pillars of creation in M16 formed by the mechanism proposed here and not by

observation of a scale-invariant, universal behavior of 2D gases through
in-situ density and density fluctuation measurements at different temperatures

universal region near the BKT phase transition, provide a sensitive test to the
universality prediction by classical-field theory[11,12] and quantum Monte

holes inspiral. The twisting of the magnetic field lines then generates jets
around each black hole, even though these are not spinning. Their simulations
show the formation of such a dual jet geometry and how it transitions to a

long-standing puzzles about the nature of dark matter, the dark compact objects

scalar fields are very poorly constrained by astronomical observations, leading
to great uncertainties in estimates of the mass $m_\phi$ and the
self-interacting coupling constant $\lambda$ of these fields. To counter this,
we have systematically employed available astronomical observations to develop
new constraints, considerably restricting this parameter space. In particular,
by exploiting precise observations of stellar dynamics at the centre of our
Galaxy and assuming that these dynamics can be explained by a single boson
star, we determine an upper limit for the boson star compactness and impose
significant limits on the values of the properties of possible scalar fields.
Requiring the scalar field particle to follow a collisional dark matter model
further narrows these constraints. Most importantly, we find that if a scalar

when the abundances of Fe, alpha elements, and the r-process element Eu are
considered, stars separate neatly into two groups that delineate the
traditional thin and thick disk of the Milky Way. The group akin to the thin
disk is traced by stars with [Fe/H]>-0.7 and alpha/Fe<0.2. The thick disk-like
group overlaps the thin disk in [Fe/H] but has higher abundances of alpha
elements and Eu. Stars in the range -1.5<[Fe/H]<-0.7 with low [alpha/Fe]
ratios, however, seem to belong to a separate, dynamically-cold, non-rotating
component that we associate with tidal debris. The kinematically-hot stellar
halo dominates the sample for [Fe/H]<-1.5. These results suggest that it may be
possible to define the main dynamical components of the solar neighbourhood
using only their chemistry, an approach with a number of interesting
consequences. The kinematics of thin disk stars is then independent of
metallicity: their average rotation speed remains roughly constant in the range
-0.7<[Fe/H]<+0.4, a result that argues against radial migration having played a
substantial role in the evolution of the thin disk. The velocity dispersion of
stars assigned to the thin disk is also independent of [Fe/H], implying that
the familiar increase in velocity dispersion with decreasing metallicity is the
result of the increased prevalence of the thick disk at lower metallicities,
rather than of the sustained operation of a dynamical heating mechanism. The
substantial overlap in [Fe/H] and, probably, stellar age, of the various
components might affect other reported trends in the properties of stars in the
solar neighbourhood.

over a period of 2.5 years following the detection obtained with a subset of

at a 5$\sigma$ confidence level and the lightcurve is similar to those found
earlier by Comptel up to 30 MeV: a broad asymmetric first peak reaching its
maximum 0.39 +/- 0.02 cycles after the radio peak plus a second peak at 0.94
+/- 0.03. The gamma-ray spectral energy distribution of the pulsed flux
detected by Comptel and Agile is well described by a power-law (photon index
alpha=1.87+/-0.09) with a remarkable cutoff at E_c=81 +/- 20 MeV, representing
the softest spectrum observed among gamma-ray pulsars so far. The pulsar
luminosity at E > 1 MeV is $L_{\gamma}=4.2^{+0.5}_{-0.2} \times10^{35}$ erg/s,
assuming a distance of 5.2 kpc, which implies a spin-down conversion efficiency
to gamma-rays of $\sim 0.03$. The unusual soft break in the spectrum of PSR
B1509-58 has been interpreted in the framework of polar cap models as a
signature of the exotic photon splitting process in the strong magnetic field
of this pulsar. In this interpretation our spectrum constrains the magnetic
altitude of the emission point(s) at 3 km above the neutron star surface,
implying that the attenuation may not be as strong as formerly suggested
because pair production can substitute photon splitting in regions of the
magnetosphere where the magnetic field becomes too low to sustain photon
splitting. In the case of an outer-gap scenario, or the two pole caustic model,
better constraints on the geometry of the emission would be needed from the
radio band in order to establish whether the conditions required by the models
to reproduce Agile lightcurves and spectra match the polarization measurements.

singularities enjoy adjoint transitions - a phenomenon which occurs when the
gauge coupling of a node possessing adjoint matter is driven to strong coupling
in a manner resulting in a reduction of rank in the non-Abelian part of the
gauge group and a subsequent flow to weaker coupling. We describe adjoint
transitions in a simple family of cascades based on a Z2-orbifold of the
conifold using field theory. We show that they are dual to Higgsing and produce
varying numbers of U(1) factors, moduli, and monopoles in a manner which we
calculate. This realizes a large family of cascades which proceed through
Seiberg duality and Higgsing. We briefly describe the supergravity limit of our
analysis, as well as a prescription for treating more general theories. A
special role is played by N=2 SQCD. Our results suggest that additional light
fields are typically generated when UV completing certain constructions of
spontaneous supersymmetry breaking into cascades, potentially leading to
instabilities.

magnetized collisionless electron-ion shocks by means of 2.5D particle-in-cell
simulations with ion-to-electron mass ratios (m_i/m_e) ranging from 16 to 1000.
We explore a range of inclination angles between the pre-shock magnetic field
and the shock normal. In ""subluminal"" shocks, where relativistic particles can
escape ahead of the shock along the magnetic field lines, ions are efficiently
accelerated via a Fermi-like mechanism. The downstream ion spectrum consists of
a relativistic Maxwellian and a high-energy power-law tail, which contains ~5%
of ions and ~30% of ion energy. Its slope is -2.1. Upstream electrons enter the
shock with lower energy than ions, so they are more strongly tied to the field.
As a result, only ~1% of the incoming electrons are Fermi-accelerated at the
shock before being advected downstream, where they populate a steep power-law
tail (with slope -3.5). For ""superluminal"" shocks, where relativistic particles
cannot outrun the shock along the field, the self-generated turbulence is not
strong enough to permit efficient Fermi acceleration, and the ion and electron
downstream spectra are consistent with thermal distributions. The incoming
electrons are heated up to equipartition with ions, due to strong
electromagnetic waves emitted by the shock into the upstream. Thus, efficient
electron heating (>15% of the upstream ion energy) is the universal property of
relativistic electron-ion shocks, but significant nonthermal acceleration of
electrons (>2% by number, >10% by energy, with slope flatter than -2.5) is hard
to achieve in magnetized flows and requires weakly magnetized shocks
(magnetization <1e-3). These findings place important constraints on the models
of AGN jets and Gamma Ray Bursts that invoke particle acceleration in
relativistic magnetized electron-ion shocks.

They suggested that this is in conflict with the LCDM model, which predicts the
hierarchical formation of cosmic structures from bottom up. In light of the
importance of the issue, we performed a similar analysis on global parameters
of galaxies with a significantly larger database and two additional parameters,
LJ and RJ, of the near-infrared J band. We used databases from the Arecibo
Legacy Fast Arecibo L-band Feed Array Survey for the atomic gas properties, the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey for the optical properties, and the Two Micron All Sky
Survey for the near-infrared properties, of the galaxies. We conducted
principal component analysis (PCA) to find relations among these observational
variables and confirmed that the five parameters in the work of Disney et al.
are indeed correlated. The first principal component dominates the correlations
among the five parameters and can explain 86% of the variation in the data.
When color (g - i) is included, the first component still dominates and the
color forms a second principal component that is almost independent of other
parameters. The overall trend in our near-infrared PCA is very similar, except
that color (i - J) seems even more decoupled from all other parameters. The
dominance of the first principal component suggests that the structure of
galaxies is governed by a single physical parameter. This confirms the
observational results in Disney et al. However, based on the importance of the
baryon physics in galaxy formation, we are not convinced that the hierarchical
structure formation scenario and the notion of cold dark matter are necessarily
flawed.

observe that the resistivity perpendicular to the layers, \rho(perp), becomes
finite at a temperature consistent with previous studies on very similar
materials; however, the onset of finite parallel resistivity, \rho(par), occurs
at a much higher temperature. This behavior contradicts conventional theory,
which predicts that \rho(perp) and \rho(par) should become finite at the same
temperature. Voltage vs. current measurements near the threshold of voltage
detectability indicate linear behavior perpendicular to the layers, becoming
nonlinear at higher currents, while the behavior is nonlinear from the onset
parallel to the layers. These results, in the presence of moderate H(perp),
appear consistent with superconducting order parallel to the layers with
voltage fluctuations between the layers due to thermal noise. In search of
uncommon effects that might help to explain this behavior, we have performed
diffraction measurements that provide evidence for H(perp)-induced charge and
spin stripe order. The field-induced decoupling of superconducting layers is

Great Observatories All-Sky LIRG Survey (GOALS) sample based on 5-15um low

of extended emission as a function of wavelength for the galaxies in the
sample, FEE_lambda. We can identify 3 general types of FEE_lambda: one where it
is constant, one where features due to emission lines and PAHs appear more
extended than the continuum, and a third which is characteristic of sources
with deep silicate absorption at 9.7um. More than 30% of the galaxies have a
median FEE_lambda larger than 0.5 implying that at least half of their MIR
emission is extended. Luminous Infrared Galaxies (LIRGs) display a wide range
of FEE in their warm dust continuum (0<=FEE_13.2um<=0.85). The large values of
FEE_13.2um that we find in many LIRGs suggest that their extended MIR continuum
emission originates in scales up to 10kpc. The mean size of the LIRG cores at
13.2um is 2.6kpc. However, once the LIR of the systems reaches the threshold of
~10^11.8Lsun, all sources become clearly more compact, with FEE_13.2um<=0.2,
and their cores are unresolved. Our estimated upper limit for the core size of
ULIRGs is less than 1.5kpc. The analysis indicates that the compactness of
systems with LIR>~10^11.25Lsun strongly increases in those classified as
mergers in their final stage of interaction. The FEE_13.2um is also related to
the contribution of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) to the MIR. Galaxies which
are more AGN-dominated are less extended, independently of their LIR. We
finally find that the extent of the MIR continuum emission is correlated with
the far-IR IRAS log(f_60um/f_100um) color. This enables us to place a lower
limit to the area in a galaxy from where the cold dust emission may originate,
a prediction which can be tested soon with the Herschel Space Telescope.

three-component (colors) fermionic atoms in optical lattices using a

increases in the low temperature region, a second-order transition occurs from
a Fermi liquid to a color superfluid (CSF). In the strong attractive region, a
first-order transition occurs from a CSF to a trionic state. In the high

observed with increasing the strength of the attractive interaction. The

that the EOS cannot be accurately described within either the local density or

closes just below 11 GPa. At this pressure, the HSE06 functional predicts a
first-order isostructural transition accompanied by a pronounced elastic
instability of the longitudinal-acoustic branches that provides the mechanism
for the experimentally observed decomposition. Using an extensive Wannier
function analysis, we show that the structural transformation is driven by a
phase transition of the electronic structure, which is manifested by a
discontinuous change in the hybridization between Pd-d and N-p electrons as
well as a conversion from single to triple bonded nitrogen dimers. We argue for
the possible existence of a critical point for the isostructural transition, at
which massive fluctuations in both the electronic as well as the structural

because their good isolation from the environment precludes the rapid loss of
quantum coherence. Many strategies have been developed to further extend their
decoherence times. Some of them make use of decoupling techniques based on the
Carr-Purcell and Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill pulse sequences. In many cases, when
applied to inhomogeneous samples, they yield a magnetization decay much slower
than the Hahn echo. However, we have proved that these decays cannot be
associated with longer decoherence times as coherences remain frozen. They
result from coherences recovered after their storage as local polarization and
thus they can be used as memories. We show here how this freezing of the
coherent state, which can subsequently be recovered after times longer than the
natural decoherence time of the system, can be generated in a controlled way
with the use of field gradients. A similar behaviour of homogeneous samples in
inhomogeneous fields are demonstrated. It is emphasized that the effects of
inhomogeneities in solid state NMR, independently of their origin, should not
be disregarded as they play a crucial role in multipulse sequences.

within the context of the coupled electron pair approximation (CEPA), and
several CEPA-like topological factors are presented for use within the p-2RDM

traditional CEPA methodologies. We cite the important distinction that the
obtained energies represent stationary points, facilitating the efficient
evaluation of properties and geometric derivatives. The p-2RDM/n formalism is
generalized for an equal treatment of exclusion-principle-violating (EPV)

maximum coding gain for Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems with two
transmit and two receive antennas. Since four information symbols taken from an
M-QAM constellation are selected to construct one Golden Code codeword, a
maximum likelihood decoder using sphere decoding has the worst-case complexity
of O(M^4), when the Channel State Information (CSI) is available at the
receiver. Previously, this worst-case complexity was reduced to O(M^(2.5))
without performance degradation. When the CSI is known by the transmitter as
well as the receiver, beamforming techniques that employ singular value
decomposition are commonly used in MIMO systems. In the absence of channel
coding, when a single symbol is transmitted, these systems achieve the full
diversity order provided by the channel. Whereas this property is lost when
multiple symbols are simultaneously transmitted. However, uncoded multiple
beamforming can achieve the full diversity order by adding a properly designed
constellation precoder. For 2 \times 2 Fully Precoded Multiple Beamforming
(FPMB), the general worst-case decoding complexity is O(M). In this paper,
Golden Coded Multiple Beamforming (GCMB) is proposed, which transmits the
Golden Code through 2 \times 2 multiple beamforming. GCMB achieves the full
diversity order and its performance is similar to general MIMO systems using
the Golden Code and FPMB, whereas the worst-case decoding complexity of
O(sqrt(M)) is much lower. The extension of GCMB to larger dimensions is also

It is shown that the non-LTE corrections to the N abundances increase with
Teff. The nitrogen overabundance as a general feature of this type of stars is
confirmed. A majority of the stars has a nitrogen excess [N/Fe] between 0.2 and
0.9 dex with the maximum position of the star's distribution on [N/Fe] between
0.4 and 0.7 dex. The N excesses are discussed in light of predictions for
B-type main sequence (MS) stars with rotationally induced mixing and for their
next evolutionary phase, i.e. A- and F-type supergiants that have experienced
the first dredge-up. Rotationally induced mixing in the MS progenitors of the
supergiants may be a significant cause of the nitrogen excesses. When comparing
our results with predictions of the theory developed for stars with the mixing,
we find that the bulk of the supergiants (28 of 30) show the N enrichment that
can be expected (i) either after the MS phase for stars with the initial
rotational velocities v0 = 200-400 km s-1, (ii) or after the first dredge-up
for stars with v0 = 50-400 km s-1. The latter possibility is preferred on
account of the longer lifetime for stars on red-blue loops following the first
dredge-up. Two supergiants without a discernible N enrichment, namely HR 825
and HR 7876, may be post-MS objects with the relatively low initial rotational
velocity of about 100 km s-1. The suggested range for v0 is approximately
consistent with inferences from the observed projected rotational velocities of
B-type MS stars, progenitors of A and F supergiants.

explored within context of defect model for mixed mobile ion effect (V.
Belostotsky, J. Non-Cryst. Solids (2007)). In mixed alkaline earth glasses
mixed cation effect is observed as in ionic diffusivity as well as in the glass
transition temperature reflecting the fact that movement of dissimilar ions of
unequal size is accompanied by formation of intrinsic defects in glass matrix
when mobile ions enter foreign sites. It is qualitatively similar to that in
mixed alkali glasses although quantitatively it is much less pronounced due to
lower mobility of alkaline earth ions. In mixed cation glasses whose
composition involves dissimilar mobile ions with ionic radii close to each
other 'classical' mixed mobile ion effect is not observed in sense we face it
in mixed alkali glasses. In alkali alkaline earth glasses like
xNa2O-(1-x)CaO-SiO2 and xK2O-(1-x)BaO-SiO2 energy landscape is comprised of
regular unicharged alkali sites and double-charged alkaline-earth sites, and
mobile ions of both types can utilize either vacant sites without their
rearrangement. This leads to increase in apparent diffusivity of alkaline-earth
species when their concentration decreases which is opposite to what is
reported for mixed alkali glasses. Mixed cation effect in the transition
temperature of such glasses is not observed which is clear indication that site
rearrangement involving generation of intrinsic defects does not occur when a
mobile ion enters a foreign site. Similar picture is observed in Na-Ag
phosphate glasses where mixed cation effect in ionic conductivity is
anomalously low because dissimilar ions have almost equal ionic radii and can
utilize either vacant sites without their rearrangement and intrinsic defect
formations in nearest glass matrix

best-fit with a consistent phase that is compatible with a circular orbit. By
combining our secondary eclipse times with others published in the literature,
as well as the radial velocity and transit timing data for this system, we show
that there is no evidence that WASP-12b is precessing at a detectable rate, and
show that its orbital eccentricity is likely zero. Our thermal emission
measurements also allow us to constrain the characteristics of the planet's
atmosphere; our Ks-band eclipse depth argues in favour of inefficient day to
nightside redistribution of heat and a low Bond albedo for this very highly
irradiated hot Jupiter. The J and H-band brightness temperatures are slightly
cooler than the Ks-band brightness temperature, and thus hint at the
possibility of a modest temperature inversion deep in the atmosphere of
WASP-12b; the high pressure, deep atmospheric layers probed by our J and H-band
observations are likely more homogenized than the higher altitude layer.
Lastly, our best-fit Ks-band eclipse has a marginally longer duration than

tidally stripped from the planet - as was predicted for this system by Li &

relay selection results to each relay. Instead, by broadcasting the link
adaptation results from the destination, each relay will automatically
understand whether it is selected or not. The lower and upper bounds of the
throughput of the proposed scheme are derived. The analysis and simulation
results indicate that the proposed scheme provides synergistic gains compared
to the pure relay selection and link adaptation schemes.

unconventional superconductors. Furthermore, recent experiments have revealed
the existence of spurious low energy in-gap states in tunnel junctions of

feasible ""strain engineering"" of the electronic states of graphene by proper

radiative feedback processes that are potentially important during Population
III star formation. Specifically, we examine the effect of the Lyman-Werner
(photodissociating) background on the early stages of primordial star
formation, which serves to delay the onset of star formation in a given halo
but never suppresses it entirely. We also examine the effect that both
photodissociating and ionizing radiation in I-fronts from nearby stellar
systems have on the formation of primordial protostellar clouds. Depending on
the strength of the incoming radiation field and the central density of the
halos, Pop III star formation can be suppressed, unaffected, or even enhanced.
Understanding these and other effects is crucial to modeling Population III
star formation and to building the earliest generations of galaxies in the
Universe.

particularly in more populous clusters. At face value there is no compelling
evidence for non-random selection of stellar masses in low mass clusters but
there is arguably some evidence that the maximum stellar mass is anomalously
low (compared with the expectations of random mass selection) in clusters
containing more than several thousand stars. Whether or not this effect is then
imprinted on the IGIMF then depends on the slope of the cluster mass function.
We argue that a more economical approach to the problem would instead involve
direct analysis of the upper IMF in clusters using statistical tests for
truncation of the mass function. When such an approach is applied to data from

behavior of particles after shell crossing on the matter power spectrum. We
compare their amplitude with the perturbative terms that can be obtained within
the fluid description of the system, to estimate the range of scales where such
perturbative approaches are relevant. We use the simple Zeldovich dynamics as a
benchmark, as it allows the exact computation of the full nonlinear power
spectrum and of perturbative terms at all orders. Then, we introduce a ""sticky
model"" that coincides with the Zeldovich dynamics before shell crossing but
shows a different behavior afterwards. Thus, their power spectra only differ in
their nonperturbative terms. We consider both the real-space and redshift-space
power spectra. We find that the potential of perturbative schemes is greater at
higher redshift for a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. For the real-space power
spectrum, one can go up to order $66$ of perturbation theory at $z=3$, and to
order $9$ at $z=0$, before the nonperturbative correction surpasses the
perturbative correction of that order. This allows us to increase the upper
bound on $k$ where systematic theoretical predictions may be obtained by
perturbative schemes, beyond the linear regime, by a factor $\sim 26$ at $z=3$
and $\sim 6.5$ at $z=0$. This provides a strong motivation to study
perturbative resummation schemes, especially at high redshifts $z \geq 1$. We
find similar results for the redshift-space power spectrum, with characteristic
wavenumbers that are shifted to lower values as redshift-space distortions
amplify higher order terms of the perturbative expansions while decreasing the
resummed nonlinear power at high $k$.

studies, we propose a multistage categorization strategy which allows
establishing an automatic categorization model flexibly for a given emotional
speech categorization task. We apply the strategy to the Serbian Emotional
Speech Corpus (GEES) and the Danish Emotional Speech Corpus (DES), where human
performance was reported in previous psychological studies. Our work is the
first attempt to apply machine learning to the GEES corpus where the human
recognition rates were only available prior to our study. Unlike the previous
work on the DES corpus, our work focuses on a comparison to human performance
under the same experimental settings. Our studies suggest that
psychology-inspired systems yield behaviours that, to a great extent, resemble
what humans perceived and their performance is close to that of humans under
the same experimental setup. Furthermore, our work also uncovers some
differences between machine and humans in terms of emotional state recognition
from speech.

dominating the star-formation rate density at redshifts ~1 - 2. Therefore, they
are important objects in order to understand how galaxies form and evolve
through cosmic time. We aim to characterize the morphologies of the stellar
continuum and the ionized gas (H_alpha) emissions from local sources, and
investigate how they relate with the dynamical status and IR-luminosity of the
sources. We use optical (5250 -- 7450 \AA) integral field spectroscopic (IFS)
data for a sample of 38 sources, taken with the VIMOS instrument, on the VLT.
We present an atlas of IFS images of continuum emission, H_alpha emission, and
H_alpha equivalent widths for the sample. The H_alpha images frequently reveal
extended structures that are not visible in the continuum, such as HII regions
in spiral arms, tidal tails, rings, of up to few kpc from the nuclear regions.
The morphologies of the continuum and H_alpha images are studied on the basis
of the C_{2kpc} parameter, which measures the concentration of the emission
within the central 2 kpc. The C_{2kpc} values found for the H_alpha images are
higher than those of the continuum for the majority (85%) of the objects in our
sample. On the other hand, most of the objects in our sample (~62%) have more
than half of their H_alpha emission outside the central 2 kpc. No clear trends
are found between the values of C_{2kpc} and the IR-luminosity of the sources.
On the other hand, our results suggest that the star formation in advance
mergers and early-stage interactions is more concentrated than in isolated
objects. We compared the H_alpha and infrared emissions as tracers of the
star-formation activity. We find that the star-formation rates derived using
the H_alpha luminosities generally underpredict those derived using the IR
luminosities, even after accounting for reddening effects.

have i.i.d. lifetime durations, which are not necessarily exponentially
distributed, and each individual gives birth independently at constant rate
\lambda. We assume that types are clonally inherited. We consider two classes
of speciation models in this setting. In the immigration model, new individuals
of an entirely new species singly enter the population at constant rate \mu
(e.g., from the mainland into the island). In the mutation model, each
individual independently experiences point mutations in its germ line, at
constant rate \theta. We are interested in the species abundance distribution,
i.e., in the numbers, denoted I_n(k) in the immigration model and A_n(k) in the
mutation model, of species represented by k individuals, k=1,2,...,n, when
there are n individuals in the total population. In the immigration model, we
prove that the numbers (I_t(k);k\ge 1) of species represented by k individuals
at time t, are independent Poisson variables with parameters as in Fisher's
log-series. When conditioning on the total size of the population to equal n,
this results in species abundance distributions given by Ewens' sampling
formula. In particular, I_n(k) converges as n\to\infty to a Poisson r.v. with
mean \gamma /k, where \gamma:=\mu/\lambda. In the mutation model, as
n\to\infty, we obtain the almost sure convergence of n^{-1}A_n(k) to a
nonrandom explicit constant. In the case of a critical, linear birth--death
process, this constant is given by Fisher's log-series, namely n^{-1}A_n(k)
converges to \alpha^{k}/k, where \alpha :=\lambda/(\lambda+\theta). In both
models, the abundances of the most abundant species are briefly discussed.

the well-known asteroseismic diagnostic echelle diagrams, examining how

the identification of modes. We illustrate the work with a real case: the
solar-like star $\eta$ Bootis. The modeling takes into account rotation effects
on the equilibrium models through an effective gravity and on the oscillation
frequencies through both perturbative and non-perturbative calculations. We
compare the results of both type of calculations in the context of the regular
spacings (like the small spacings and the scaled small spacings) and echelle
diagrams. We show that for echelle diagrams the perturbative approach remains
valid for rotational velocities up to 40-50 km/s. We show that for the
rotational velocities measured in solar-like stars, theoretical oscillation
frequencies must be corrected up to the second-order in terms of rotation rate,
including near degeneracy effects. For rotational velocities of about 16 km/S
and higher, diagnostics on large spacings and on modal identification through
echelle diagrams can be significantly altered by the presence of the $m\neq0$
components of the rotationally split modes. We found these effects to be
detectable in the observed frequency range. Analysis of the effects of rotation
on small spacings and scaled small spacings reveals that these can be of the
order of, or even larger than surface effects, typically turbulence,
microscopic diffusion, etc. Furthermore, we show that scaled spacings are
significantly affected by stellar distortion even for small stellar rotational
velocities (from 10-15 km/s) and therefore some care must be taken when using
them as indicators for probing deep stellar interiors.

formation in a galaxy. Because H2 is difficult to observe directly in dense and
cold clouds, tracers like CO are used. However, at low metallicities
especially, CO only traces the shielded interiors of the clouds. mm dust
emission can be used as a tracer to unveil the total dense gas masses. The
comparison of masses deduced from the continuum SIMBA 1.2 mm emission and
virial masses in a sample of giant molecular clouds (GMCs), in the SW region of
the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), showed a discrepancy that is in need of an
explanation. This study aims at better assessing possible uncertainties on the
dust emission observed in the sample of GMCs from the SMC and focuses on the
densest parts of the GMCs where CO is detected. New observations were obtained
with the LABOCA camera on the APEX telescope. All GMCs previously observed in
CO are detected and their emission at 870microns is compared to ancillary data.
The different contributions to the sub-mmm emission are estimated, as well as
dust properties, in order to deduce molecular cloud masses precisely. The
(sub-)mm emission observed in the GMCs in the SW region of the SMC is dominated
by dust emission and masses are deduced for the part of each cloud where CO is
detected and compared to the virial masses. The mass discrepancy between both
methods is confirmed at 870microns with the LABOCA observations: the virial
masses are on average 4 times smaller than the masses of dense gas deduced from
dust emission, contrary to what is observed for equivalent clouds in our
Galaxy. The origin of this mass discrepancy in the SMC remains unkown. The
direct interpretation of this effect is that the CO linewidth used to compute
virial masses do not measure the full velocity distribution of the gas.
Geometrical effects and uncertainties on the dust properties are also
discussed.

the phase space quantum mechanics or deformation quantization. It is shown that
the quantization naturally arises as an appropriate deformation of the
classical Hamiltonian mechanics. More precisely, the deformation of the
point-wise product of observables to an appropriate noncommutative
$\star$-product and the deformation of the Poisson bracket to an appropriate
Lie bracket is the key element in introducing the quantization of classical
Hamiltonian systems.
  The considered class of deformations and the corresponding $\star$-products
contains as a special cases all deformations which can be found in the
literature devoted to the subject of the phase space quantum mechanics.
  Fundamental properties of $\star$-products of observables, associated with
the considered deformations are presented as well. Moreover, a space of states
containing all admissible states is introduced, where the admissible states are
appropriate pseudo-probability distributions defined on the phase space. It is
proved that the space of states is endowed with a structure of a Hilbert
algebra with respect to the $\star$-multiplication.
  The most important result of the paper shows that developed formalism is more
fundamental then the axiomatic ordinary quantum mechanics which appears in the
presented approach as the intrinsic element of the general formalism. The
equivalence of two formulations of quantum mechanics is proved by observing
that the Wigner-Moyal transform has all properties of the tensor product. This
observation allows writing many previous results found in the literature in a
transparent way, from which the equivalence of the two formulations of quantum
mechanics follows naturally.

It has recently been proposed that the jets of low-luminosity radio
galaxies are powered by direct accretion of the hot phase of the IGM onto the
central black hole. Cold gas remains a plausible alternative fuel supply,
however. The most compelling evidence that cold gas plays a role in fueling
radio galaxies is that dust is detected more commonly and/or in larger
quantities in (elliptical) radio galaxies compared with radio-quiet elliptical
galaxies. On the other hand, only small numbers of radio galaxies have yet been
detected in CO (and even fewer imaged), and whether or not all radio galaxies
have enough cold gas to fuel their jets remains an open question. If so, then
the dynamics of the cold gas in the nuclei of radio galaxies may provide
important clues to the fuelling mechanism. Aims. The only instrument capable of
imaging the molecular component on scales relevant to the accretion process is
ALMA, but very little is yet known about CO in southern radio galaxies. Our aim
is to measure the CO content in a complete volume-limited sample of southern
radio galaxies, in order to create a well-defined list of nearby targets to be
imaged in the near future with ALMA. Methods. APEX has recently been equipped
with a receiver (APEX-1) able to observe the 230 GHz waveband. This allows us
to search for CO(2-1) line emission in our target galaxies. Results. Here we
present the results for our first three southern targets, proposed for APEX-1
spectroscopy during science verification: NGC3557, IC4296 and NGC1399. The
experiment was successful with two targets detected, and possible indications
for a double-horned CO line profile, consistent with ordered rotation. These
early results are encouraging, demonstrating that APEX can efficiently detect
CO in nearby radio galaxies. We therefore plan to use APEX to obtain CO
spectroscopy for all our southern targets.

binary massive black holes. After the binary orbit decays due to an interaction
with a massive circumbinary disk, the binary is decoupled from the circumbinary
disk because the orbital-decay timescale due to emission of gravitational wave
becomes shorter than the viscous timescale evaluated at the inner edge of
circumbinary disk. During the subsequent evolution, the accretion disk, which
is truncated at the tidal radius because of the tidal torque, also shrinks as
the orbital decay. Assuming that the disk mass changed by this process is all
accreted, the disk becomes radiatively inefficient when the semi-major axis is
several hundred Schwarzschild radii. The high-energy radiations, in spite of a
low bolometric luminosity, are emitted from an accretion disk around each black
hole long before the black hole coalescence as well as the gravitational wave
signals. The synchrotron process can notably produce potentially observable
radio emissions at large distances if there is a strong, dipole magnetic field
around each black hole. In unequal mass-ratio binaries, step-like light
variations are seen in the observed light curve because the luminosity is
higher and its duration time are shorter in the radio emission by the disk
around the secondary black hole than those of the primary black hole. Such a
precursor would be unique to not a single black hole system but a binary black
hole system, and implies that binary black holes finally merge without
accretion disks.

radiation-pressure force and is collimated by the Lorentz force of a magnetic
tower, inflated magnetic structure made by toroidal magnetic field lines
accumulated around the black hole, though radiation energy greatly dominates
over magnetic energy. This magnetic tower is collimated by a geometrically
thick accretion flow supported by radiation-pressure force. This type of jet
may explain relativistic jets from Galactic microquasars, appearing at high

the DNA sequence are readily accessible for regulatory proteins and which are
not. Genome-wide maps of nucleosome positions have revealed a salient pattern
around transcription start sites, involving a nucleosome-free region (NFR)
flanked by a pronounced periodic pattern in the average nucleosome density.
While the periodic pattern clearly reflects well-positioned nucleosomes, the
positioning mechanism is less clear. A recent experimental study by Mavrich et
al. argued that the pattern observed in S. cerevisiae is qualitatively
consistent with a `barrier nucleosome model', in which the oscillatory pattern
is created by the statistical positioning mechanism of Kornberg and Stryer. On
the other hand, there is clear evidence for intrinsic sequence preferences of
nucleosomes, and it is unclear to what extent these sequence preferences affect
the observed pattern. To test the barrier nucleosome model, we quantitatively
analyze yeast nucleosome positioning data both up- and downstream from NFRs.
Our analysis is based on the Tonks model of statistical physics which
quantifies the interplay between the excluded-volume interaction of nucleosomes
and their positional entropy. We find that although the typical patterns on the
two sides of the NFR are different, they are both quantitatively described by
the same physical model, with the same parameters, but different boundary
conditions. The inferred boundary conditions suggest that the first nucleosome
downstream from the NFR (the +1 nucleosome) is typically directly positioned
while the first nucleosome upstream is statistically positioned via a
nucleosome-repelling DNA region. These boundary conditions, which can be
locally encoded into the genome sequence, significantly shape the statistical
distribution of nucleosomes over a range of up to ~1000 bp to each side.

adsorption mode above the center of the benzene molecule, while Rh2 and Pd2 are
adsorbed parallel to the benzene plane. The ground state of Co2Bz (with a dimer
adsorption energy of about 1 eV) is well separated from other possible
structures and spin states. In conjunction with similar results obtained by ab
initio quantum chemical calculations, this implies that a stable Co2Bz complex
with C6v symmetry is likely to exist. Chemical bonding to the carbon ring does
not destroy the magnetic state and the characteristic level scheme of the
cobalt dimer. Calculations including spin- orbit coupling show that the huge
MAE of the free Co dimer is preserved in the Co2Bz structure. The MAE predicted
for this structure is much larger than the MAE of other magnetic molecules
known hitherto, making it an interesting candidate for high-density magnetic
recording. Among all the other investigated complexes, only Ru2Bz shows a

constancy of the mean curvature is equivalent to the harmonicity of the Gauss

the central engine. We compute the temporal evolution of the average flare
luminosity $< L >$ in the common rest frame energy band of 44 GRBs taken from
the large \emph{Swift} 5-years data base. Our work highlights the importance of
a proper consideration of the threshold of detection of flares against the
contemporaneous continuous X-ray emission. In the time interval $30
\rm{s}<t<1000\,\rm{s}$ we find $< L >\propto t^{-2.7\pm 0.1}$; this implies
that the flare isotropic energy scaling is $E_{\rm{iso,flare}}\propto
t^{-1.7}$. The decay of the continuum underlying the flare emission closely
tracks the average flare luminosity evolution, with a typical flare to
steep-decay luminosity ratio which is $L_{\rm{flare}}/L_{\rm{steep}}=4.7$: this
suggests that flares and continuum emission are deeply related to one another.
We infer on the progenitor properties considering different models. According
to the hyper-accreting black hole scenario, the average flare luminosity
scaling can be obtained in the case of rapid accretion ($t_{\rm{acc}}\ll t$) or
when the last $\sim 0.5 M_{\sun}$ of the original $14 M_{\sun}$ progenitor star
are accreted. Alternatively, the steep $\propto t^{-2.7}$ behaviour could be
triggered by a rapid outward expansion of an accretion shock in the material
feeding a convective disk. If instead we assume the engine to be a rapidly
spinning magnetar, then its rotational energy can be extracted to power a jet
whose luminosity is likely to be between the monopole ($L\propto e^{-2t}$) and
dipole ($L\propto t^{-2}$) cases. In both scenarios we suggest the variability,
which is the main signature of the flaring activity, to be established as a
consequence of different kinds of instabilities.

The situation is much more promising in models without a light Higgs boson, in
which the goal can be met. The prices are: a relatively low messenger scale,
semiperturbativity before the GUT scale, and some amount of
degeneracy/alignement of order of the Cabibbo angle in the sfermion sector. A
crucial role is played by the increased quartic coupling. The resulting

a few have also been observed in the outer main belt and near-Earth space.
These asteroids -referred to as V-types- have surface compositions that
resemble that of the 530km sized asteroid Vesta. Besides the compositional
similarity, dynamical evidence also links many V-type asteroids to Vesta.
Moreover, Vesta is one of the few asteroids to have been identified as source
of specific classes of meteorites, the howardite, eucrite, diogenite
achondrites (HEDs). Despite the general consensus on the outlined scenario,
several questions remain unresolved. In particular, it is not clear if the
observed spectral diversity among Vesta, V-types and HEDs is due to space
weathering, as is thought to be the case for S-type asteroids. In this paper,
SDSS photometry is used to address the question of whether the spectral
diversity among candidate V-types and HEDs can be explained by space
weathering. We show that visible spectral slopes of V-types are systematically
redder with respect to HEDs, in a similar way to what is found for ordinary
chondrite meteorites and S-types. On the assumption that space weathering is
responsible for the slope mismatch, we estimated an upper limit for the
reddening timescale of about 0.5Ga. Nevertheless, the observed slope mismatch
between HEDs and V-types poses several puzzles to understanding its origin. The
implication of our findings is also discussed in the light of Dawn mission to
Vesta.

to incoherent scattering of light from the lasers forming the lattice. Because
atoms scattered into higher bands do not thermalize on the timescale of typical
experiments, this process cannot be described by the total energy increase in
the system alone (which is determined by single-particle effects). The heating
instead involves an important interplay between the atomic physics of the
heating process and the many-body physics of the state. We characterize the
effects on many-body states for various system parameters, where we observe
important differences in the heating for strongly and weakly interacting
regimes, as well as a strong dependence on the sign of the laser detuning from
the excited atomic state. We compute heating rates and changes to
characteristic correlation functions based both on perturbation theory
calculations, and a time-dependent calculation of the dissipative many-body
dynamics. The latter is made possible for 1D systems by combining
time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (t-DMRG) methods with
quantum trajectory techniques.

where now the first contribution depends on the geometry of the spacetime

mathematically very simple. It is the linear structure of the Hilbert space

usually talk about the superposition principle valid for individual and
composed quantum objects. So, while the source of interference is
understandable it leads in fact to many counter-intuitive physical phenomena
which puzzle physicists for almost hundred years.
  The present thesis studies interference in two seemingly disjoint fields of
physics. However, both have strong links to quantum information processing and
hence are related. In the first part we study the intriguing properties of
quantum walks. In the second part we analyze a sophisticated application of
wave packet dynamics in atoms and molecules for factorization of integers.

gravitational-wave (GW) detector called Einstein Telescope (ET). An important
kind of source for ET will be the inspiral and merger of binary neutron stars
(BNS) up to $z \sim 2$. If BNS mergers are the progenitors of short-hard
$\gamma$-ray bursts, then some fraction of them will be seen both
electromagnetically and through GW, so that the luminosity distance and the
redshift of the source can be determined separately. An important property of
these `standard sirens' is that they are \emph{self-calibrating}: the
luminosity distance can be inferred directly from the GW signal, with no need
for a cosmic distance ladder. Thus, standard sirens will provide a powerful
independent check of the $\Lambda$CDM model. In previous work, estimates were
made of how well ET would be able to measure a subset of the cosmological
parameters (such as the dark energy parameter $w_0$) it will have access to,
assuming that the others had been determined to great accuracy by alternative
means. Here we perform a more careful analysis by explicitly using the
potential Planck CMB data as prior information for these other parameters. We
find that ET will be able to constrain $w_0$ and $w_a$ with accuracies $\Delta
w_0 = 0.099$ and $\Delta w_a = 0.302$, respectively. These results are compared
with projected accuracies for the JDEM Baryon Acoustic Oscillations project and

the quantum dot is performed by resonant optical excitation and subsequent
partial exciton ionization; the hole is removed from the quantum dot whilst the
electron remains stored. When subject to a magnetic field applied in Faraday
geometry, we show how the spin of the electron can be prepared with a
polarization up to 65% simply by controlling the voltage applied to the gate
electrode. After generation, the electron spin is stored in the quantum dot
before being read out using an all optical implementation of spin to charge
conversion technique, whereby the spin projection of the electron is mapped
onto the more robust charge state of the quantum dot. After spin to charge
conversion, the charge state of the dot is repeatedly tested by pumping a
luminescence recycling transition to obtain strong readout signals. In
combination with spin manipulation using fast optical pulses or microwave
pulses, this provides an ideal basis for probing spin coherence in single
self-assembled quantum dots over long timescales and developing optimal methods

finite-volume effects, thereby limiting its use to dilute flows. The second,

dense systems as well. To demonstrate the significance of the dense-phase
treatment relative to its dilute counterpart, the ratio of dense (GHD) to
dilute (GD) predictions of all relevant transport coefficients and equations of
state are plotted over a range of physical parameters (volume fraction,
coefficients of restitution, material density ratio, diameter ratio, and
mixture composition). These plots reveal the deviation between the two
treatments, which can become quite large ($>$100%) even at moderate values of
the physical parameters. Such information will be useful when choosing which
theory is most applicable to a given situation, since the dilute theory offers
relative simplicity and the dense theory offers improved accuracy. It is also
important to note that several corrections to original GHD expressions are
presented here in the form of a complete, self-contained set of relevant

J141256.0+792204 (Calvera). Calvera was observed in the X-rays with XMM/EPIC
twice for a total exposure time of ~50 ks. The source spectrum is thermal and
well reproduced by a two component model composed of either two hydrogen
atmosphere models, or two blackbodies (kT_1~ 55/150 eV, kT_2~ 80/250 eV,
respectively, as measured at infinity). Evidence was found for an absorption
feature at ~0.65 keV; no power-law high-energy tail is statistically required.
Using pn and MOS data we discovered pulsations in the X-ray emission at a
period P=59.2 ms. The detection is highly significant (> 11 sigma), and
unambiguously confirms the neutron star nature of Calvera. The pulse profile is
nearly sinusoidal, with a pulsed fraction of ~18%. We looked for the timing
signature of Calvera in the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) database and found
a significant (~5 sigma) pulsed signal at a period coincident with the X-ray
value. The gamma-ray timing analysis yielded a tight upper limit on the period
derivative, dP/dt < 5E-18 s/s (dE_rot/dt <1E33 erg/s, B<5E10 G for magneto-
dipolar spin-down). Radio searches at 1.36 GHz with the 100-m Effelsberg radio
telescope yielded negative results, with a deep upper limit on the pulsed flux
of 0.05 mJy. Diffuse, soft (< 1 keV) X-ray emission about 13' west of the
Calvera position is present both in our pointed observations and in archive
ROSAT all-sky survey images, but is unlikely associated with the X-ray pulsar.
Its spectrum is compatible with an old supernova remnant (SNR); no evidence for
diffuse emission in the radio and optical bands was found. The most likely
interpretations are that Calvera is either a central compact object escaped
from a SNR or a mildly recycled pulsar; in both cases the source would be the
first ever member of the class detected at gamma-ray energies.

voters' preferences as an imperfect approximation to some kind of consensus is
deeply rooted in social choice literature. It allows one to define
(""rationalize"") voting rules via a consensus class of elections and a distance:
a candidate is said to be an election winner if she is ranked first in one of
the nearest (with respect to the given distance) consensus elections. It is
known that many classic voting rules can be distance rationalized. In this
paper, we provide new results on distance rationalizability of several
Condorcet-consistent voting rules. In particular, we distance rationalize
Young's rule and Maximin rule using distances similar to the Hamming distance.
We show that the claim that Young's rule can be rationalized by the Condorcet
consensus class and the Hamming distance is incorrect; in fact, these consensus
class and distance yield a new rule which has not been studied before. We prove
that, similarly to Young's rule, this new rule has a computationally hard
winner determination problem.

designed to give a comprehensive introduction to Weyl quantization and
semiclassics via Egorov's theorem.
  Chapter 2 gives a quick overview of classical and quantum mechanics on R^d.
Some mathematical preliminaries concerning Hilbert space theory, operator
theory and tempered distributions are detailed in Chapters 3-5. Weyl
quantization and semiclassics are the content of Chapters 6 and 7. Finally, an
application of Weyl calculus to Born-Oppenheimer systems is discussed in
Chapter 8.
