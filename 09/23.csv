droplet, with homeotropic boundary conditions, within the Landau-de Gennes

for a globally stable configuration in this model framework and is also a
prototype configuration for studying isolated point defects in condensed matter
physics. The static properties of the radial-hedgehog solution are governed by
a nonlinear singular ordinary differential equation. We consider two different
limits separately - the \emph{vanishing core limit} and \emph{low-temperature

perturbation methods and stability analysis to study the qualitative properties
of the radial-hedgehog solution, both in the vicinity of and away from the
defect core. We establish the instability of the radial-hedgehog solution with
respect to biaxial perturbations in certain parameter regimes and demonstrate
the stability of the radial-hedgehog solution in other parameter regimes. Our
results complement previous work in the field, are rigorous in nature and give
information about the role of geometry and temperature on the properties of the
radial-hedgehog solution and the associated biaxial instabilities.

one: it is a point particle. Naturally, the energy density and the spacetime
curvature have a delta-like singularity at the apex of the conical defect, but
that doesn't give rise to any unphysical situations. Since the conical solution
implies the presence of a source, applying reverse enginnering, one can
identify the coupling term that is required in the action to account for that

operation that gives rise to the topological defect and the interaction term in
the action that produces it. This idea has a natural extension to higher
dimensions, where instead of a point particle (zero-brane) one finds membranes
of even spatial dimensions (p-branes, with p=2n). The generalization to other
abelian and nonabelian gauge theories --including (super-) gravities-- is
fairly straightforward: the 2n-brane couple to a (2n+1) Chern-Simons form. The
construction suggests a generic role for Chern-Simons forms as the natural way
to couple a gauge connection to a brane and avoids the inconsistency that
results from the minimal coupling between a brane and a fundamental p-form

broken symmetry condensates in exact diagonalization studies. Using this
technique we show that, for all cases studied, the groundstate of the

quantitative determinations of the condensate fraction. We discuss the
experimental consequences of our results. In particular, we explain the meaning

describing the strength of the heterotic deformation. We calculate both \beta
functions, \beta_g and \beta_\gamma at one loop, determining the flow of g^2

asymptotically free. The \beta function for the ratio \rho =\gamma^2/g^2
exhibits an infrared fixed point at \rho={1}{2}. Formally this fixed point lies
outside the validity of the one-loop approximation. We argue, however, that the
fixed point at \rho ={1}{2} may survive to all orders. The reason is the
enhancement of symmetry - emergence of a chiral fermion flavor symmetry in the
heterotically deformed Lagrangian - at \rho ={1}{2}. Next we argue that
\beta_\rho formally obtained at one loop, is exact to all orders in the large-N

breaking of the central symmetry has shown, that it practically disappears with
symmetry breaking by more than 0.05 degrees. Thus we can confirmed the
manifestation of the central symmetry of celestial sphere through existence of
the central symmetrical pairs of quasars, which can be interpreted as the pairs
of images of the same object.
  We shown the possibility of a theoretical modeling of the observed
dependencies in the closed Universe model. It can be supposed, that a
relatively small amount of the discovered pairs of the opposite quasars is
conditioned by the fact, that the opposite objects for most of the quasars are
galaxies, which are not included to the chosen as initial source of data quasar
catalog SDSS-DR5.

4-point tensor integrals of rank R-1, such that the appearance of the inverse

represented in terms of 4-point integrals, defined in $d$ dimensions,
$4-2\epsilon \le d \le 4-2\epsilon+2(R-1)$, with higher powers of the
propagators. They can be further reduced to expressions which stay free of the
inverse 4-point Gram determinants but contain higher-dimensional 4-point
integrals with only the first power of scalar propagators, plus 3-point tensor
coefficients. A direct evaluation of the higher dimensional 4-point functions
would avoid the appearance of inverse powers of the Gram determinants
completely. The simplest approach, however, is to apply here dimensional
recurrence relations in order to reduce them to the familiar 2- to 4-point
functions in generic dimension $d = 4-2\eps$, introducing thereby coefficients
with inverse 4-point Gram determinants up to power $R$ for tensors of rank $R$.
For small or vanishing Gram determinants - where this reduction is not
applicable - we use analytic expansions in positive powers of the Gram
determinants. Improving the convergence of the expansions substantially with
Pad\'e approximants we close up to the evaluation of the 4-point tensor
coefficients for larger Gram determinants. Finally, some relations are
discussed which may be useful for analytic simplifications of Feynman diagrams.

development of universal grippers able to pick up unfamiliar objects of widely
varying shape and surface properties remains, however, challenging. Most
current designs are based on the multi-fingered hand, but this approach
introduces hardware and software complexities. These include large numbers of
controllable joints, the need for force sensing if objects are to be handled
securely without crushing them, and the computational overhead to decide how
much stress each finger should apply and where. Here we demonstrate a
completely different approach to a universal gripper. Individual fingers are
replaced by a single mass of granular material that, when pressed onto a target
object, flows around it and conforms to its shape. Upon application of a vacuum
the granular material contracts and hardens quickly to pinch and hold the
object without requiring sensory feedback. We find that volume changes of less
than 0.5% suffice to grip objects reliably and hold them with forces exceeding
many times their weight. We show that the operating principle is the ability of
granular materials to transition between an unjammed, deformable state and a
jammed state with solid-like rigidity. We delineate three separate mechanisms,

polarization in arbitrary random variable that can be decomposed into a pair of
orthogonal subspaces. The method uses measures based on comparisons of given
dynamics to its counterpart with statistically independent components. The
formalism of previously considered X-distributions is used to express the
aforementioned comparisons, in effect putting the former approach on solid
footing. Our analysis leads to definition of a suitable correlation coefficient
with clear statistical meaning. We apply the method to the dynamics induced by
pure-glue lattice QCD in local left-right components of overlap Dirac
eigenmodes. It is found that, in finite physical volume, there exists a
non-zero physical scale in the spectrum of eigenvalues such that eigenmodes at
smaller (fixed) eigenvalues exhibit convex X-distribution (positive
correlation), while at larger eigenvalues the distribution is concave (negative
correlation). This chiral polarization scale thus separates a regime where
dynamics enhances chirality relative to statistical independence from a regime
where it suppresses it, and gives an objective definition to the notion of
""low"" and ""high"" Dirac eigenmode. We propose to investigate whether the
polarization scale remains non-zero in the infinite volume limit, in which case
it would represent a new kind of low energy scale in QCD.

the outer solar atmosphere will be in the focus of solar physics research for
the next decades. One key-ingredient is the process of magnetic flux emergence
into the solar photosphere, and the reorganization to form the magnetic
phenomena of active regions like sunspots and pores.
  On July 4, 2009, we observed a region of emerging magnetic flux, in which a
proto-spot without penumbra forms a penumbra within some 4.5 hours. This
process is documented by multi-wavelength observations at the German VTT: (a)
imaging, (b) data with high resolution and temporal cadence acquired in Fe I
617.3 nm with the 2D imaging spectropolarimter GFPI, and (c) scans with the
slit based spectropolarimeter TIP in Fe I 1089.6 nm. MDI contiuum maps and
magnetograms are used to follow the formation of the proto-spot, and the
subsequent evolution of the entire active region.
  During the formation of the penumbra, the area and the magnetic flux of the
spot increases. The additional magnetic flux is supplied by the adjacent region
of emerging magnetic flux: As emerging bipole separate, the poles of the spot
polarity migrate towards the spot, and finally merge with it. As more and more
flux is accumulated, a penumbra forms. From inversions we infer maps for the
magnetic field and the Doppler velocity (being constant along the
line-of-sight). We calculate the magnetic flux of the forming spot and of the
bipole footpoints that merge with the proto-spot. We witness the onset of the
Evershed flow and the associated enhance of the field inclination as individual
penumbral filaments form. Prior to the formation of individual penumbral
sectors we detect the existence of 'counter' Evershed flows. These in-flows
turn into the classical radial Evershed outflows as stable penumbra segments
form.

regions very close to their surface. These regions are caused by an opacity
peak associated with iron ionization. Cantiello et al. (2009) found a possible
connection between the presence of sub-photospheric convective motions and
small scale stochastic velocities in the photosphere of early-type stars. This
supports a physical mechanism where microturbulence is caused by waves that are
triggered by subsurface convection zones. They further suggest that clumping in
the inner parts of the winds of OB stars could be related to subsurface
convection, and that the convective layers may also be responsible for
stochastic excitation of non-radial pulsations. Furthermore, magnetic fields
produced in the iron convection zone could appear at the surface of such
massive stars. Therefore subsurface convection could be responsible for the
occurrence of observable phenomena such as line profile variability and
discrete absorption components. These phenomena have been observed for decades,
but still evade a clear theoretical explanation. Here we present preliminary
results from 3D MHD simulations of such subsurface convection.

the entire area of light illumination. A maximum external photo-responsivity of
6.1 mA/W is achieved at 1.55 {\mu}m wavelength, a very impressive value given
that the material is below one nanometer in thickness. Moreover, owing to the
unique band structure and exceptional electronic properties of graphene, high

prokaryotic genomes scales approximately quadratically with their total number
of genes. We propose a conceptual explanation of this finding and illustrate it
using a simple model in which metabolic and regulatory networks of prokaryotes
are shaped by horizontal gene transfer of coregulated metabolic pathways.
Adapting to a new environmental condition monitored by a new transcription
factor (e.g., learning to use another nutrient) involves both acquiring new
enzymes and reusing some of the enzymes already encoded in the genome. As the
repertoire of enzymes of an organism (its toolbox) grows larger, it can reuse
its enzyme tools more often and thus needs to get fewer new ones to master each
new task. From this observation, it logically follows that the number of
functional tasks and their regulators increases faster than linearly with the
total number of genes encoding enzymes. Genomes can also shrink, e.g., because
of a loss of a nutrient from the environment, followed by deletion of its
regulator and all enzymes that become redundant. We propose several simple
models of network evolution elaborating on this toolbox argument and
reproducing the empirically observed quadratic scaling. The distribution of
lengths of pathway branches in our model agrees with that of the real-life
metabolic network of Escherichia coli. Thus, our model provides a qualitative
explanation for broad distributions of regulon sizes in prokaryotes.

quadratically scale with the total number of protein-coding genes. Toolbox
model was recently proposed to explain this scaling for metabolic enzymes and
their regulators. According to its rules the metabolic network of an organism
evolves by horizontal transfer of pathways from other species. These pathways
are part of a larger ""universal"" network formed by the union of all
species-specific networks. It remained to be understood, however, how the
topological properties of this universal network influence the scaling law of
functional content of genomes. In this study we answer this question by first
analyzing the scaling properties of the toolbox model on arbitrary tree-like
universal networks. We mathematically prove that the critical branching
topology, in which the average number of upstream neighbors of a node is equal
to one, is both necessary and sufficient for the quadratic scaling. Conversely,
the toolbox model on trees with exponentially expanding, supercritical topology
is characterized by the linear scaling with logarithmic corrections. We further
generalize our model to include reactions with multiple substrates/products as
well as branched or cyclic metabolic pathways. Unlike the original model the
new version employs evolutionary optimized pathways with the smallest number of
reactions necessary to achieve their metabolic tasks. Numerical simulations of
this most realistic model on the universal network from the KEGG database again
produced approximately quadratic scaling. Our results demonstrate why, in spite
of their ""small-world"" topology, real-life metabolic networks are characterized
by a broad distribution of pathway lengths and sizes of metabolic regulons in
regulatory networks.

we have 53 cluster galaxies with measured dispersions, and HST/ACS-derived

L* galaxy at z~1, unlike most previous z~1 cluster samples which are complete
only for the massive cluster members (>1e11 M_sun). We find no evidence for a
change in the tilt of the fundamental plane (FP). Nor do we find evidence for
evolution in the slope of the color-dispersion relation and M/L_B-dispersion
relations; measuring evolution at a fixed dispersion should minimize the impact
of size evolution found in other work. The M/L_B at fixed dispersion evolves by
\Delta log10 M/L_B=-0.50 +/- 0.03 between z=0.83 and z=0.02 or d(log10

uncertainty showing the dependence of z* on the assumptions we make about the

the M/L- and color-dispersion relations imply that the formation epoch depends
weakly on mass, ranging from z*=2.3 +1.3 -0.3 at 300 km/s to z*=1.7 +0.3 -0.2
at 160 km/s and implies that the IMF similarly varies slowly with galaxy mass.

metal-poor stars includes new measurements from 88 high resolution and high
signal-to-noise spectra obtained with the Tull Spectrograph on the 2.7m Smith

high Pb/Eu ratios produced in the s-process at low metallicity, and our new
observations then allow us to identify a sample of stars with no detectable
s-process material. In these stars, we find no significant increase in the
Pb/Eu ratios with increasing metallicity. This suggests that s-process material
was not widely dispersed until the overall Galactic metallicity grew
considerably, perhaps even as high as [Fe/H]=-1.4. We identify a dispersion of
at least 0.5 dex in [La/Eu] in metal-poor stars with [Eu/Fe]<+0.6 attributable
to the r-process, suggesting that there is no unique ""pure"" r-process elemental
ratio among pairs of rare earth elements. We confirm earlier detections of an
anti-correlation between Y/Eu and Eu/Fe bookended by stars strongly enriched in
the r-process (e.g., CS 22892-052) and those with deficiencies of the heavy
elements (e.g., HD 122563). We can reproduce the range of Y/Eu ratios using
simulations of high-entropy neutrino winds of core-collapse supernovae that
include charged-particle and neutron-capture components of r-process
nucleosynthesis. The heavy element abundance patterns in most metal-poor stars
do not resemble that of CS 22892-052, but the presence of heavy elements such
as Ba in nearly all metal-poor stars without s-process enrichment suggests that
the r-process is a common phenomenon.

Network (AN) to provide support to its combat aircrafts on a mission. The
reliability needed for continuous operation of an AN is difficult to achieve
through completely infrastructure-less mobile ad hoc networks. In this paper we
first propose an architecture for an AN where airborne networking platforms
(ANPs - aircrafts, UAVs and satellites) form the backbone of the AN. In this
architecture, the ANPs can be viewed as mobile base stations and the combat
aircrafts on a mission as mobile clients. The combat aircrafts on a mission
move through a space called air corridor. The goal of the AN design is to form
a backbone network with the ANPs with two properties: (i) the backbone network
remains connected at all times, even though the topology of the network changes
with the movement of the ANPs, and (ii) the entire 3D space of the air corridor
is under radio coverage at all times by the continuously moving ANPs.
  In addition to proposing an architecture for an AN, the contributions of the
paper include, development of an algorithm that finds the velocity and
transmission range of the ANPs so that the dynamically changing backbone
network remains connected at all times, development of a routing algorithm that
ensures a connection between the source-destination node pair with the fewest
number of path switching, given the dimensions of the air corridor and the
radius of the coverage sphere associated with an ANP, development of an
algorithm that finds the fewest number of ANPs required to provide complete
coverage of the air corridor at all times, development of an algorithm that
provides connected-coverage to the air corridor at all times, and development
of a visualization tool that depicts the movement patterns of the ANPs and the
resulting dynamic graph and the coverage volume of the backbone network.

predicted Cold Dark Matter (CDM) subhalos compared to satellite galaxies known
to exist in the Local Group. The most popular interpretation of the MSP is that
the smallest dark matter halos in the universe are extremely inefficient at
forming stars. The question from that standpoint is to identify the feedback
source that makes small halos dark and to identify any obvious mass scale where
the truncation in the efficiency of galaxy formation occurs. Among the most
exciting developments in near-field cosmology in recent years is the discovery
of a new population satellite galaxies orbiting the Milky Way and M31. Wide
field, resolved star surveys have more than doubled the dwarf satellite count
in less than a decade, revealing a population of ultrafaint galaxies that are
less luminous that some star clusters. For the first time, there are empirical
reasons to believe that there really are missing satellite galaxies in the
Local Group, lurking just beyond our ability to detect them, or simply
inhabiting a region of the sky that has yet to have been surveyed. Both
kinematic studies and completeness-correction studies seem to point to a
characteristic potential well depth for satellite subhalos that is quite close
to the mass scale where photoionization and atomic cooling should limit galaxy
formation. Among the more pressing problems associated with this interpretation
is to understand the selection biases that limit our ability to detect the
lowest mass galaxies. The least massive satellite halos are likely to host
stealth galaxies with very-low surface brightness and this may be an important
limitation in the hunt for low-mass fossils from the epoch of reionization.

diminishing variability with training. Reaching movements associated with

degrading the complexity of indirect pathway dynamics by switching it from

the packet scheduling at MAC layer. In addition to explicit frequency

ECR-MAC introduces lightweight explicit time negotiation. This two-dimensional
negotiation enables ECR-MAC to exploit the advantage of both multiple channels

for the use of multiple channels available at the PHY layer, but its MAC

SUs to identify and use the unused frequency spectrum in a way that constrains
the level of interference to the primary users (PUs). Extensive simulation

(2009) of
planetesimal-driven migration using our N-body code SyMBA (Duncan et al.,
1998). The previous work focused on the case of a single planet of mass Mem,
immersed in a planetesimal disk with a power-law surface density distribution
and Rayleigh distributed eccentricities and inclinations. Typically 10^4-10^5
equal-mass planetesimals were used, where the gravitational force (and the
back-reaction) on each planetesimal by the Sun and planetwere included, while
planetesimal-planetesimal interactions were neglected. The runs reported on
here incorporate the dynamical effects of a gas disk, where the Adachi et al.
(1976) prescription of aerodynamic gas drag is implemented for all bodies. In
some cases the Papaloizou and Larwood (2000) prescription of Type-I migration
for the planet are implemented, as well as a mass distribution. In the gas-free
cases, rapid planet migration was observed - at a rate independent of the
planet's mass - provided the planet's mass was not large compared to the mass
in planetesimals capable of entering its Hill sphere. In such cases, both
inward and outward migrations can be self-sustaining, but there is a strong
propensity for inward migration. When a gas disk is present, aerodynamic drag
can substantially modify the dynamics of scattered planetesimals. For
sufficiently large or small mono-dispersed planetesimals, the planet typically
migrates inward. However, for a range of plausible planetesimal sizes (i.e.
0.5-5.0 km at 5.0 AU in a minimum mass Hayashi disk) outward migration is
usually triggered, often accompanied by substantial planetary mass accretion.
The origins of this behaviour are explained in terms of a toy model. The
effects of including a size distribution and torques associated with Type-I
migration are also discussed.

degenerate core. In agreement with the results by other research groups, we
find that the O-Ne core is formed via the formation of a convective flame that
proceeds to the centre of the star. The evolution which follows is strongly
determined by the description of the mass loss mechanism. Use of the
traditional formalism with the super-wind phase favours a long evolution with
many thermal pulses, and the achievement of an advanced nucleosynthesis, due
the large temperatures reached by the bottom of the external mantle. Use of a
mass loss recipe with a strong dependence on the luminosity favours an early
consumption of the stellar envelope, so that the extent of the nucleosynthesis,
and thus the chemical composition of the ejecta, is less extreme. The
implications for the multiple populations in globular clusters are discussed.
If the ""extreme"" populations present in the most massive clusters are a result
of direct formation from the super-AGB ejecta, their abundances may constitute
a powerful way of calibrating the mass loss rate of this phase. This
calibration will also provide informations on the fraction of super-AGBs
exploding as single e-capture supernova, leaving a neutron star remnant in the

temperatures and large densities. At constant temperature, we find that an
amorphous glassy state is entered upon compression, as in colloidal hard
spheres, but the glass unexpectedly melts when density increases further. We
attribute this re-entrant fluid-glass transition to particle softness, and
correlate this behaviour to previously reported anomalies in soft systems, thus
emphasizing its generality. The predicted fluid-glass-fluid sequence is
confirmed numerically.

inefficient at forming stars, perhaps because the molecular gas is
kinematically unsettled and turbulent. Low-luminosity mid-IR continuum emission
together with low-ionization emission line spectra indicate low-luminosity AGNs
in all but 3 radio MOHEGs. The AGN X-ray emission measured with Chandra is not
luminous enough to power the H2 emission from MOHEGs. Nearly all radio MOHEGs

coordinating bone-resorbing cells (osteoclasts) and bone-forming cells
(osteoblasts) in the form of Bone Multicellular Units (BMUs). Understanding the
emergence of such structured units out of the complex network of biochemical
interactions between bone cells is essential to extend our fundamental
knowledge of normal bone physiology and its disorders. To this end, we propose
a spatio-temporal continuum model that integrates some of the most important
interaction pathways currently known to exist between cells of the osteoblastic
and osteoclastic lineage. This mathematical model allows us to test the
significance and completeness of these pathways based on their ability to
reproduce the spatio-temporal dynamics of individual BMUs. We show that under
suitable conditions, the experimentally-observed structured cell distribution
of cortical BMUs is retrieved. The proposed model admits travelling-wave-like
solutions for the cell densities with tightly organised profiles, corresponding
to the progression of a single remodelling BMU. The shapes of these spatial
profiles within the travelling structure can be linked to the intrinsic
parameters of the model such as differentiation and apoptosis rates for bone
cells. In addition to the cell distribution, the spatial distribution of
regulatory factors can also be calculated. This provides new insights on how
different regulatory factors exert their action on bone cells leading to
cellular spatial and temporal segregation, and functional coordination.

the case of codimension-1, this equation reduces to the evolution equation of
the extrinsic curvature of a spacelike hypersurface. In the more interesting
case of codimension-2, after selecting a local null frame, this deformation
equation reduces to the well known (cross) focusing equations. We show how the
thermodynamics of trapping horizons is related to these deformation equations
in two different formalisms: with and without introducing quasilocal energy. In
the formalism with the quasilocal energy, the Hawking mass in four dimension is
generalized to higher dimension, and it is found that the deformation of this
energy inside a marginal surface can be also decomposed into the contributions
from matter fields and gravitational radiation as in the four dimension. In the
formalism without the quasilocal energy, we generalize the definition of slowly
evolving future outer trapping horizons proposed by Booth to past trapping
horizons. The dynamics of the trapping horizons in FLRW universe is given as an
example. Especially, the slowly evolving past trapping horizon in the FLRW
universe has close relation to the scenario of slow-roll inflation. Up to the
second order of the slowly evolving parameter in this generalization, the
temperature (surface gravity) associated with the slowly evolving trapping
horizon in the FLRW universe is essentially the same as the one defined by
using the quasilocal energy.

properties of solar-type stars is studied. Rotational mixing changes the global
properties of a solar-type star with a significant increase of the effective
temperature resulting in a shift of the evolutionary track to the blue part of
the HR diagram. These differences are related to changes of the chemical
composition, because rotational mixing counteracts the effects of atomic
diffusion leading to larger helium surface abundances for rotating models than
for non-rotating ones. Higher values of the large frequency separation are then
found for rotating models than for non-rotating ones at the same evolutionary
stage, because the increase of the effective temperature leads to a smaller
radius and hence to an increase of the stellar mean density. Rotational mixing
also has a considerable impact on the structure and chemical composition of the
central stellar layers by bringing fresh hydrogen fuel to the core, thereby
enhancing the main-sequence lifetime. The increase of the central hydrogen
abundance together with the change of the chemical profiles in the central
layers result in a significant increase of the values of the small frequency
separations and of the ratio of the small to large separations for models
including shellular rotation. This increase is clearly seen for models with the
same age sharing the same initial parameters except for the inclusion of
rotation as well as for models with the same global stellar parameters and in
particular the same location in the HR diagram. By computing rotating models of
solar-type stars including the effects of a dynamo that possibly occurs in the
radiative zone, we find that the efficiency of rotational mixing is strongly
reduced when the effects of magnetic fields are taken into account, in contrast
to what happens in massive stars.

Idealising the experimental situation and extending the notion of a quantum

system into a steady state at long times. Strikingly, this state is not a
thermal one: its properties depend on the full functional form of the initial
electron distribution, and not simply on the initial energy density. Further,
we demonstrate that measurements of the tunneling density of states at long

density, depending on details of the analysis, and discuss this finding in
connection with an apparent energy loss observed experimentally. More
specifically, we treat several separate cases: for filling factor \nu=1 we
discuss relaxation due to finite-range or Coulomb interactions between
electrons in the same channel, and for filling factor \nu=2 we examine
relaxation due to contact interactions between electrons in different channels.
In both instances we calculate analytically the long-time asymptotics of the
single-particle correlation function. These results are supported by an exact
solution at arbitrary time for the problem of relaxation at \nu=2 from an

the inverse dynamic model, which is linear with respect to the dynamic
parameters. This model is sampled while the robot is tracking reference
trajectories that excite the system dynamics. This allows using linear
least-squares techniques to estimate the parameters. The efficiency of this
method has been proved through the experimental identification of many
prototypes and industrial robots. However, this method requires the joint
force/torque and position measurements and the estimate of the joint velocity
and acceleration, through the bandpass filtering of the joint position at high
sampling rates. The proposed new method requires only the joint force/torque
measurement. It is a closed-loop output error method where the usual joint
position output is replaced by the joint force/torque. It is based on a
closed-loop simulation of the robot using the direct dynamic model, the same
structure of the control law, and the same reference trajectory for both the
actual and the simulated robot. The optimal parameters minimize the 2-norm of
the error between the actual force/torque and the simulated force/torque. This
is a non-linear least-squares problem which is dramatically simplified using
the inverse dynamic model to obtain an analytical expression of the simulated
force/torque, linear in the parameters. A validation experiment on a 2
degree-of-freedom direct drive robot shows that the new method is efficient.

large number of peers. But it is very difficult to control the initial data
distribution because every user has the freedom to share any data with other
users. The system scalability can be improved by distributing the load across
multiple servers which is proposed by replication. The large scale content
distribution systems were improved broadly using the replication techniques.
The demanded contents can be brought closer to the clients by multiplying the
source of information geographically, which in turn reduce both the access
latency and the network traffic. In addition to this, due to the intrinsic
dynamism of the P2P environment, static data distribution cannot be expected to
guarantee good load balancing. If the hot peers become bottleneck, it leads to
increased user response time and significant performance degradation of the
system. Hence an effective load balancing mechanism is necessary in such cases
and it can be attained efficiently by intelligent data replication. In this
paper, we propose a cluster based replication architecture for load-balancing
in peer-to-peer content distribution systems. In addition to an intelligent
replica placement technique, it also consists of an effective load balancing
technique. In the intelligent replica placement technique, peers are grouped
into strong and weak clusters based on their weight vector which comprises
available capacity, CPU speed, access latency and memory size. In order to
achieve complete load balancing across the system, an intracluster and
inter-cluster load balancing algorithms are proposed. We are able to show that
our proposed architecture attains less latency and better throughput with
reduced bandwidth usage, through the simulation results.

by using an efficient heuristic clustering algorithm in the third phase.
Finally, rules are extracted from compact ANNs by examining the discretized
activation values of the hidden nodes. Extensive experimental studies on three
benchmark classification problems, i.e. breast cancer, diabetes and lenses,
demonstrate that REANN can generate high quality rules from ANNs, which are

variations of transiting exoplanets. In 2009 we collected 9 light curves of 8
transits of the exoplanet WASP-10b. Combining these data with published ones,
we found that transit timing cannot be explained by a constant period but by a
periodic variation. Simplified three-body models which reproduce the observed
variations of timing residuals were identified by numerical simulations. We
found that the configuration with an additional planet of mass of $\sim$0.1
$M_{\rm{J}}$ and orbital period of $\sim$5.23 d, located close to the outer 5:3
mean motion resonance, is the most likely scenario. If the second planet is a
transiter, the estimated flux drop will be $\sim$0.3 per cent and can be
observable with a ground-based telescope. Moreover, we present evidence that
the spots on the stellar surface and rotation of the star affect the radial
velocity curve giving rise to spurious eccentricity of the orbit of the first
planet. We argue that the orbit of WASP-10b is essentially circular. Using the
gyrochronology method, the host star was found to be $270 \pm 80$ Myr old. This
young age can explain the large radius reported for WASP-10b.

rules from these words is used to derive feature set from preclassified text

for final classification. Experimental results show that the classifier build
this way is more accurate than the existing text classification systems.

field in the domain is assumed homogeneous and inclined. The efficiency of the

solar, and an age around 4Gyr. It thus offers the opportunity to check our
understanding of the physics and the evolution of solar-type stars in a cluster
environment. We present the first spectroscopic study at high resolution,
R~50,000, of the potentially best solar twin, M67-1194, identified among
solar-like stars in M67. Based on a pre-selection of solar-twin candidates
performed at medium resolution by Pasquini et al. (2008), we explore the
chemical-abundance similarities and differences between M67-1194 and the Sun,
using VLT/FLAMES-UVES. Working with a solar twin in the framework of a
differential analysis, we minimize systematic model errors in the abundance
analysis compared to previous studies which utilized more evolved stars to
determine the metallicity of M67. We find M67-1194 to have stellar parameters
indistinguishable from the solar values, with the exception of the overall
metallicity which is slightly super-solar ([Fe/H]=0.023 +/- 0.015). An age
determination based on evolutionary tracks yields 4.2 +/- 1.6Gyr. Most
surprisingly, we find the chemical abundance pattern to closely resemble the
solar one, in contrast to most known solar twins in the solar neighbourhood. We
confirm the solar-twin nature of M67-1194, the first solar twin known to belong
to a stellar association. This fact allows us to put some constraints on the
physical reasons for the seemingly systematic departure of M67-1194 and the Sun
from most known solar twins regarding chemical composition. We find that
radiative dust cleansing by nearby luminous stars may be the explanation for
the peculiar composition of both the Sun and M67-1194, but alternative
explanations are also possible. The chemical similarity between the Sun and
M67-1194 also suggests that the Sun once formed in a cluster like M67.

simulations and radiative transfer to produce synthetic observations with
spatial resolution and noise levels typical of Herschel surveys. We estimate
dust colour temperatures using different pairs of intensities, calculate column
densities and compare the estimated masses with the true values. We compare
these results to the case when all five Herschel wavelengths are available. We
investigate the effects of spatial variations of dust properties and the
influence of embedded heating sources. Wrong assumptions of dust opacity and
its spectral index beta can cause significant systematic errors in mass
estimates. These are mainly multiplicative and leave the slope of the mass
spectrum intact, unless cores with very high optical depth are included.
Temperature variations bias colour temperature estimates and, in quiescent
cores with optical depths higher than for normal stable cores, masses can be
underestimated by up to one order of magnitude. When heated by internal
radiation sources the observations recover the true mass spectra. The shape,
although not the position, of the mass spectrum is reliable against
observational errors and biases introduced in the analysis. This changes only
if the cores have optical depths much higher than expected for basic
hydrostatic equilibrium conditions. Observations underestimate the value of
beta whenever there are temperature variations along the line of sight. A bias
can also be observed when the true beta varies with wavelength. Internal
heating sources produce an inverse correlation between colour temperature and
beta that may be difficult to separate from any intrinsic beta(T) relation of
the dust grains. This suggests caution when interpreting the observed mass
spectra and the spectral indices.

this diversity can be characterised by the eigenvalue spectrum of the spatial
autocorrelation kernel. This justifies to use the term diversity spectrum for
it. We show how the diversity spectrum can be calculated for any such
geometrical object and any fading statistics represented by the power azimuth
spectrum (PAS). We give rigorous estimates for the accuracy of the numerically
calculated eigenvalues. The numerically calculated diversity spectra provide
useful hints for the optimisation of the geometry of an antenna array.
Furthermore, for a channel coded system, they allow to evaluate the time
interleaving depth that is necessary to exploit the diversity gain of the code.

[2] show that one random item price (the same on each item) yields revenue
within a \Theta(log m + log n) factor of optimum and this factor is tight. We
define the hereditary maximizers property of buyer valuations (satisfied by any
multi-unit or gross substitutes valuation) that is sufficient for a significant
improvement of the approximation factor in the dynamic (k > 1) setting. Our
main result is a non-increasing, randomized, schedule of k equal item prices
with expected revenue within a O((log m + log n) / k) factor of optimum for
private valuations with hereditary maximizers. This factor is almost tight: we
show that any pricing scheme over k days has a revenue approximation factor of
at least (log m + log n) / (3k). We obtain analogous matching lower and upper
bounds of \Theta((log n) / k) if all valuations have the same maximum. We
expect our upper bound technique to be of broader interest; for example, it can
significantly improve the result of Akhlaghpour et al. [1]. We also initiate
the study of revenue maximization given allocative externalities (i.e.
influences) between buyers with combinatorial valuations. We provide a rather
general model of positive influence of others' ownership of items on a buyer's
valuation. For affine, submodular externalities and valuations with hereditary
maximizers we present an influence-and-exploit (Hartline et al. [13]) marketing

our approximation factor, despite an affine increase (due to externalities) in

and the wiretapper's channel are Binary Erasure Channels (BEC). We propose a
code construction method using two edge type LDPC codes based on the coset
encoding scheme. Using a standard LDPC ensemble with a given threshold over the
BEC, we give a construction for a two edge type LDPC ensemble with the same
threshold. If the given standard LDPC ensemble has degree two variable nodes,
our construction gives rise to degree one variable nodes in the code used over
the main channel. This results in zero threshold over the main channel. In
order to circumvent this problem, we numerically optimize the degree
distribution of the two edge type LDPC ensemble. We find that the resulting
ensembles are able to perform close to the boundary of the rate-equivocation
region of the wiretap channel.
  There are two performance criteria for a coding scheme used over a wiretap
channel: reliability and secrecy. The reliability measure corresponds to the
probability of decoding error for the intended receiver. This can be easily
measured using density evolution recursion. However, it is more challenging to
characterize secrecy, corresponding to the equivocation of the message for the
wiretapper. M\'easson, Montanari, and Urbanke have shown how the equivocation
can be measured for a broad range of standard LDPC ensembles for transmission
over the BEC under the point-to-point setup. By generalizing the method of
M\'easson, Montanari, and Urbanke to two edge type LDPC ensembles, we show how
the equivocation for the wiretapper can be computed. We find that relatively
simple constructions give very good secrecy performance and are close to the
secrecy capacity. However finding explicit sequences of two edge type LDPC
ensembles which achieve secrecy capacity is a more difficult problem. We pose
it as an interesting open problem.

with maps of completeness, photometric errors, and star formation histories for
dozens of galaxies within 4 Mpc. We select 12 galaxies characterized by
predominantly metal-poor populations as indicated by a very steep and blue RGB,
and which do not present any indication of recent star formation in their
color--magnitude diagrams. Thousands of AGB stars brighter than the tip of the

Poisson noise has little impact in our measurements of the AGB/RGB ratio. We
model the photometric data with a few sets of thermally pulsing AGB (TP-AGB)
evolutionary models with different prescriptions for the mass loss. This
technique allows us to set stringent constraints to the TP-AGB models of
low-mass metal-poor stars (with M<1.5 Msun, [Fe/H]<~-1.0). Indeed, those which

between 1.2 and 1.8 Myr, and finish their nuclear burning lives with masses
between 0.51 and 0.55 Msun. This is also in good agreement with recent
observations of white dwarf masses in the M4 old globular cluster. These
constraints can be added to those already derived from Magellanic Cloud star
clusters as important mileposts in the arduous process of calibrating AGB

ever detected is the 511 keV emission from positron annihilation in the Galaxy.
Despite 30 years of intense theoretical and observational investigation, the
main sources of positrons have not been identified up to now. Observations in
the 1990's with OSSE/CGRO showed that the emission is strongly concentrated
towards the Galactic bulge. In the 2000's, the SPI instrument aboard ESA's
INTEGRAL gamma-ray observatory allowed scientists to measure that emission
across the entire Galaxy, revealing that the bulge/disk luminosity ratio is
larger than observed in any other wavelength. This mapping prompted a number of
novel explanations, including rather ""exotic ones (e.g. dark matter
annihilation). However, conventional astrophysical sources, like type Ia
supernovae, microquasars or X-ray binaries, are still plausible candidates for
a large fraction of the observed total 511 keV emission of the bulge. A closer
study of the subject reveals new layers of complexity, since positrons may
propagate far away from their production sites, making it difficult to infer
the underlying source distribution from the observed map of 511 keV emission.
However, contrary to the rather well understood propagation of high energy
(>GeV) particles of Galactic cosmic rays, understanding the propagation of low
energy (~MeV) positrons in the turbulent, magnetized interstellar medium, still
remains a formidable challenge. We review the spectral and imaging properties
of the observed 511 keV emission and we critically discuss candidate positron
sources and models of positron propagation in the Galaxy.

subjected to quenched additive noise, which has been used recently as a
framework for analyzing collective effects induced by diversity. We first make
use of a self-consistent theory to calculate the phase diagram of the system,
predicting the onset of an order-disorder critical transition at a critical
value {\sigma}c of the quenched noise intensity \sigma, with critical exponents
that follow Landau theory of thermal phase transitions. We subsequently perform
a numerical integration of the system's dynamical variables in order to compare
the analytical results (valid in the thermodynamic limit and associated to the
ground state of the global Lyapunov potential) with the stationary state of the
(finite size) system. In the region of the parameter space where metastability
is absent (and therefore the stationary state coincide with the ground state of
the Lyapunov potential), a finite-size scaling analysis of the order parameter
fluctuations suggests that the magnetic susceptibility diverges quadratically
in the vicinity of the transition, what constitutes a violation of the
fluctuation-dissipation relation. We derive an effective Hamiltonian and
accordingly argue that its functional form does not allow to straightforwardly
relate the order parameter fluctuations to the linear response of the system,
at odds with equilibrium theory. In the region of the parameter space where the
system is susceptible to have a large number of metastable states (and
therefore the stationary state does not necessarily correspond to the ground
state of the global Lyapunov potential), we numerically find a phase diagram
that strongly depends on the initial conditions of the dynamical variables.

planetesimals form from a dust disk, followed by a phase of mutual

planetary embryos. However, there is a potential transition phase (which we
call the ""snowball phase""), between the formation of the first planetesimals
and the onset of mutual collisions amongst them, which has often been either
ignored or underestimated in previous studies. In this snowball phase, isolated
planetesimals move on Keplerian orbits and grow solely via the direct accretion
of sub-cm sized dust entrained with the gas in the protoplanetary disk. Using a
simplified model in which planetesimals are progressively produced from the
dust, we consider the expected sizes to which the planetesimals can grow before
mutual collisions commence and derive the dependence of this size on a number
of critical parameters, including the degree of disk turbulence, the
planetesimal size at birth and the rate of planetesimal creation. For systems
in which turbulence is weak and the planetesimals are created at a low rate and
with relatively small birth size, we show that the snowball growth phase can be
very important, allowing planetesimals to grow by a factor of 10^6 in mass
before mutual collisions take over. In such cases, the snowball growth phase
can be the dominant mode to transfer mass from the dust to planetesimals.
Moreover, such growth can take place within the typical lifetime of a
protoplanetary gas disk. A noteworthy result is that ... ...(see the paper).
For the specific case of close binaries such as Alpha Centauri ... ... (see the

trace anomaly are in very good agreement with recent lattice data down to
temperatures T~2T_c.

by the linear growth of entanglement with time. Recently numerical studies have
shown, however, that for 1D Bethe-integrable models the simulation of local
operators in the Heisenberg picture can be efficient as the corresponding
operator-space entanglement grows only logarithmically. Using the spin-1/2 XX
chain as generic example of an integrabel model that can be mapped to free
particles, we here provide a simple explanation for this. We show furthermore
that the same reduction of complexity applies to operators that have a
high-temperature auto correlation function which decays slower than
exponential, i.e., with a power law. This is amongst others the case for models
where the Blombergen-De Gennes conjecture of high-temperature diffusive
dynamics holds. Thus efficient simulability may already be implied by a single
conservation law (like that of total magnetization), as we will illustrate
numerically for the spin-1 XXZ model.

  2009",,,,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Decades of improving data and extensive theoretical research have led to a
popular model of gamma-ray bursts. According to this model, a catastrophic
event in a stellar system results in the formation of a compact central engine,
which releases a fraction of a solar rest-mass energy within seconds in the
form of ultra-relativistic jets. Dissipation of the jets energy leads first to
prompt gamma-ray emission and later to a long lasting afterglow. Here I
summarize the introduction that I gave to the debate ""where do we stand?"" in
the conference ""The Shocking Universe"" held in Venice. This is a very brief
summary of my view of the facts that we are (almost) certain about, models that
are popular but may need rethinking, and main open questions.

of expectations of functionals of Levy processes. In many situations,
Monte-Carlo methods are used. However, the simulation of a Levy process with
infinite Levy measure generally requires either to truncate small jumps or to
replace them by a Brownian motion with the same variance. We will derive bounds
for the errors generated by these two types of approximation.
