isoperimetric problems on weighted trees. In this regard, we consider different
connectivity parameters called {\it minimum normalized cuts}/{\it isoperimteric
numbers} defined through taking minimum of the maximum or the mean of the
normalized outgoing flows from a set of subdomains of vertices, where these
subdomains constitute a {\it partition}/{\it subpartition}. Following the main
result of [A. Daneshgar, {\it et. al.}, {\it On the isoperimetric spectrum of
graphs and its approximations}, JCTB, (2010)], it is known that the
isoperimetric number and the minimum normalized cut both can be described as
$\{0,1\}$-optimization programs, where the latter one does {\it not} admit a
relaxation to the reals. We show that the decision problem for the case of
taking $k$-partitions and the maximum (called the max normalized cut problem
{\rm NCP}$^M$) as well as the other two decision problems for the mean version
(referred to as {\rm IPP}$^m$ and {\rm NCP}$^m$) are $NP$-complete problems. On
the other hand, we show that the decision problem for the case of taking
$k$-subpartitions and the maximum (called the max isoperimetric problem {\rm
IPP}$^M$) can be solved in {\it linear time} for any weighted tree and any $k
\geq 2$. Based on this fact, we provide polynomial time $O(k)$-approximation
algorithms for all different versions of $k$th isoperimetric numbers
considered. Moreover, when the number of partitions/subpartitions, $k$, is a
fixed constant, as an extension of a result of B. Mohar (1989) for the case
$k=2$ (usually referred to as the Cheeger constant), we prove that max and mean
isoperimetric numbers of weighted trees as well as their max normalized cut can
be computed in polynomial time. We also prove some hardness results for the
case of simple unweighted graphs and trees.

aberration patterns: coma, astigmatism, curvature of field and distortion. When
axial symmetry is broken by the small misalignments of optical elements,
additional third-order aberration patterns arise: one each for coma,
astigmatism and curvature of field and two for distortion. Each of these
misalignment patterns is characterized by an associated two-dimensional vector,
each of which in turn is a linear combination of the tilt and decenter vectors
of the individual optical elements. For an N-mirror telescope, 2(N-1) patterns
must be measured to keep the telescope aligned. Alignment of the focal plane
may require two additional patterns. For N = 3, as in a three mirror
anastigmat, there is a two-dimensional ""subspace of benign misalignment"" over
which the misalignment patterns for third-order coma, astigmatism and curvature
of field are identically zero. One would need to measure at least one of the
two distortion patterns to keep the telescope aligned. Alternatively, one might
measure one of the fifth-order misalignment patterns, which are derived herein.
But the fifth-order patterns are rather insensitive to misalignments, even with
moderately wide fields, rendering them of relatively little use in telescope
alignment. Another alternative would be to use telescope pointing as part of
the alignment solution.

a simulated star cluster. Methods: We use direct $N$-body simulations of a star
cluster including stellar evolution in an analytic Milky Way potential and
apply a best fit to the projected number density of cluster stars. Results: We
obtain significantly overestimated star cluster masses which depend strongly on
the viewing direction. The overestimation is typically in the range of 10-50
percent and reaches a factor of 3.5 for young clusters. Mass segregation
reduces the derived limiting radii systematically.

the distribution of dark matter in the Universe. The technique, currently used,
relies on the accurate measurement of the gravitational shear that corresponds
to the first-order distortion of the background galaxy images. More recently, a
new technique has been introduced that relies on the accurate measurement of
the gravitational flexion that corresponds to the second-order distortion of
the background galaxy images. This technique should probe structures on smaller
scales than that of a shear analysis. The goal of this paper is to compare the
ability of shear and flexion to reconstruct the dark matter distribution by
taking into account the dispersion in shear and flexion measurements. Our
results show that the flexion is less sensitive than shear for constructing the
convergence maps on scales that are physically feasible for mapping, meaning
that flexion alone not be used to do convergence map reconstruction, even on

the main issues of modern astronomy. Here we present a statistical study of
mass and density distributions of infrared dark clouds (IRDCs) and fragments

progenitors of stars and so provide insights into the initial conditions of
star formation. This study makes use of a IRDC catalogue (Peretto & Fuller
2009), the largest sample of IRDC column density maps to date, containing a
total of ~11,000 IRDCs with column densities exceeding N_{H2} = 1 X10^{22}
cm^{-2} and over 50,000 single peaked IRDC fragments. The large number of
objects constitutes an important strength of this study, allowing detailed
analysis of the completeness of the sample and so statistically robust
conclusions. Using a statistical approach to assigning distances to clouds, the
mass and density distributions of the clouds and the fragments within them are
constructed. The mass distributions show a steepening of the slope when
switching from IRDCs to fragments, in agreement with previous results of
similar structures. IRDCs and fragments are divided into unbound/bound objects
by assuming Larson's relation and calculating their virial parameter. IRDCs are
mostly gravitationally bound, while a significant fraction of the fragments are
not. The density distribution of gravitationally unbound fragments shows a
steep characteristic slope. (see paper for full Abstract).

then we show that such a result can be extended to all the bright features

filling factor associated to a feature the higher the brightness of the feature
itself. Filling factors up to about 35 % are obtained for the brightest
features. Considering the values of the filling factors derived from the
inversion analysis of spectropolarimetric data and the brightness variation
observed in G-band data we put forward an upper limit for the smallest scale
over which magnetic flux concentrations in intergranular lanes produce a G-band
brightness enhancement (~ 0.1''). Moreover, the brightness saturation observed
for feature sizes comparable to the resolution of the observations is
compatible with large G-band bright features being clusters of sub-arcsecond
bright points. This conclusion deserves to be confirmed by forthcoming

comparing it with a three-dimensional classification cube, using the same set
of spectral, photometric and morphological parameters.We applied two different
methods of classification to a sample of galaxies extracted from the zCOSMOS
redshift survey, in the redshift range 0.5 < z < 1.3. The first method is the
combination of three independent classification schemes, while the second
method exploits an entirely new approach based on statistical analyses like
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Unsupervised Fuzzy Partition (UFP)
clustering method. The PCA+UFP method has been applied also to a lower redshift
sample (z < 0.5), exploiting the same set of data but the spectral ones,
replaced by the equivalent width of H$\alpha$. The comparison between the two
methods shows fairly good agreement on the definition on the two main clusters,
the early-type and the late-type galaxies ones. Our PCA-UFP method of
classification is robust, flexible and capable of identifying the two main
populations of galaxies as well as the intermediate population. The
intermediate galaxy population shows many of the properties of the green valley
galaxies, and constitutes a more coherent and homogeneous population. The
fairly large redshift range of the studied sample allows us to behold the
downsizing effect: galaxies with masses of the order of $3\cdot 10^{10}$ Msun
mainly are found in transition from the late type to the early type group at
$z>0.5$, while galaxies with lower masses - of the order of $10^{10}$ Msun -

begin their transition yet, while galaxies with very large masses ($M > 5\cdot

the Casimir force at separations beyond a characteristic length, which could
affect protein aggregation dynamics in cell membranes.

two classes of models. In the case of quantum statistical models at non-zero
chemical potential, the free energy density is directly related to the ground
state energy of a non-Hermitian, but generalized PT-symmetric Hamiltonian.
There is a corresponding class of PT-symmetric classical statistical mechanics
models with non-Hermitian transfer matrices. For both quantum and classical
models, the class of models with generalized PT symmetry is precisely the class
where the complex weight problem can be reduced to real weights, i.e., a sign
problem. The spatial two-point functions of such models can exhibit three
different behaviors: exponential decay, oscillatory decay, and periodic
behavior. The latter two regions are associated with PT symmetry breaking,
where a Hamiltonian or transfer matrix has complex conjugate pairs of
eigenvalues. The transition to a spatially modulated phase is associated with
PT symmetry breaking of the ground state, and is generically a first-order
transition. In the region where PT symmetry is unbroken, the sign problem can
always be solved in principle. Moreover, there are models with PT symmetry
which can be simulated for all parameter values, including cases where PT
symmetry is broken.

mid-infrared-bright nebulae detected with the Spitzer Space Telescope and MIPS

counterpart at shorter Spitzer/IRAC wavelengths, indicating a lack of emission
from warm dust. The two nebulae are probably wind-swept stellar ejecta released
by the central stars during a prior evolutionary phase. The nebulae partially
overlap on the sky and we speculate on the possibility that they are in the
early stage of a collision. Two other evolved massive stars have also been
identified within the area subtended by the nebulae, including a carbon-type
Wolf-Rayet star (WC8) and an O7-8 III-I star, the latter of which appears to be
embedded in one of the larger WN8-9h nebulae. The derived distances to these

estimate masses using the 12CO J=1-0 line and the observed global Tb ratios,

4.6(+0.3)(-0.7) M_Sun/L_Sun (68% confidence), from models using the most
massive dark matter halo allowed within the gravitational potential of the host

~ 4 M_Sun/L_Sun, with weak dependence on the dark matter halo structure. When
data out to 19 kpc are included, the unrealistic omission of dark matter causes
the best-fit black hole mass to decrease dramatically, to 0.6 x 10^9 M_Sun, and
the best-fit stellar mass-to-light ratio to increase to 6.7 M_Sun/L_Sun. The

idealized cases in 2-D axisymmetric geometry underscore the importance of the
initial plasma density in ICM simulations, especially the near-core values
since the radiation cooling rate is proportional to ${n_e}^2$. Heat conduction
is found to be non-effective in preventing catastrophic cooling in this
cluster. In addition we performed 2-D planar MHD simulations starting from
initial conditions deliberately violating both thermal balance and hydrostatic
equilibrium in the ICM, to assess contributions of the convective terms in the
energy balance of the system against anisotropic thermal conduction. We find
that in this case work done by the pressure on the plasma can dominate the
early evolution of the internal energy over anisotropic thermal conduction in
the presence of subsonic flows, thereby reducing the impact of the magnetic
field. Deviations from hydrostatic equilibrium near the cluster core may be
associated with transient activity of a central active galactic nucleus and/or
remnant dynamical activity in the ICM and warrant further study in three

normalized or globally normalized shear estimators. The former is the standard
approach when estimating cluster masses, while the latter is the more common
method among peak finding efforts. While both approaches have identical
signal-to-noise in the weak lensing limit, it is possible that higher order
corrections or systematics considerations make one estimator preferable over
the other. In this paper, we consider the efficacy of both estimators within
the context of stacked weak lensing mass estimation in the Dark Energy Survey
(DES). We find the two estimators have nearly identical statistical precision,
even after including higher order corrections, but that these corrections must
be incorporated into the analysis to avoid observationally relevant biases in
the recovered masses. We also demonstrate that finite bin-width effects may be
significant if not properly accounted for, and that the two estimators exhibit
different systematics, particularly with respect to contamination of the source
catalog by foreground galaxies. Thus, the two estimators may be employed as a
systematics cross-check of each other. Stacked weak lensing in the DES should
allow for the mean mass of galaxy clusters to be calibrated to about 2%
precision (statistical only), which can improve the figure of merit of the DES
cluster abundance experiment by a factor of ~3 relative to the self-calibration
expectation. A companion paper (Schmidt & Rozo, 2010) investigates how the two

In
order to properly interpret the abundance and properties of these peaks, it is
necessary to take into account the effects of the clustering of source
galaxies, among themselves and with the lens. In addition, the preferred
selection of lensed galaxies in a flux- and size-limited sample leads to
fluctuations in the apparent source density which correlate with the lensing
field (lensing bias). In this paper, we investigate these issues for two
different choices of shear estimators which are commonly in use today:
globally-normalized and locally-normalized estimators. While in principle
equivalent, in practice these estimators respond differently to systematic
effects such as lensing bias and cluster member dilution. Furthermore, we find
that which estimator is statistically superior depends on the specific shape of
the filter employed for peak finding; suboptimal choices of the
estimator+filter combination can result in a suppression of the number of high
peaks by orders of magnitude. Lensing bias generally acts to increase the
signal-to-noise \nu of shear peaks; for high peaks the boost can be as large as
\Delta \nu ~ 1-2. Due to the steepness of the peak abundance function, these
boosts can result in a significant increase in the abundance of shear peaks. A
companion paper (Rozo et al., 2010) investigates these same issues within the

metallicities of over 300 HII regions in a sample of 16 spirals that are

the relationship between gradients and nuclear underabundances, and the shape
of profile deviations from a straight line. Taken together, this evidence

black holes (SMBHs) that are found in the centres of most galaxies. Many such
scenarios predict a high-redshift population of massive black holes (MBHs),
with masses in the range 100 to 100000 times that of the Sun. When the Laser
Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is finally operational, it is likely that
it will detect on the order of 100 of these MBH binaries as they merge. The
differences between proposed population models produce appreciable effects in
the portion of the population which is detectable by LISA, so it is likely that
the LISA observations will allow us to place constraints on them. However,
gravitational wave detectors such as LISA will not be able to detect all such
mergers nor assign precise black hole parameters to the merger, due to weak
gravitational wave signal strengths. This paper explores LISA's ability to
distinguish between several MBH population models. In this way, we go beyond
predicting a LISA observed population and consider the extent to which LISA
observations could inform astrophysical modellers. The errors in LISA parameter
estimation are applied with a direct method which generates random sample
parameters for each source in a population realisation. We consider how the
distinguishability varies depending on the choice of source parameters (1 or 2
parameters chosen from masses, redshift or spins) used to characterise the
model distributions, with confidence levels determined by 1 and 2-dimensional
tests based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.

(AGNs) should be commonplace. Nevertheless, observational confirmations are
rare, especially for binaries with separations less than ten kpc. Such a system
may show two sets of narrow emission lines in a single spectrum owing to the
orbital motion of the binary. We have obtained high-resolution near-infrared
images of 50 double-peaked [O III] 5007 AGNs with the Keck II laser guide star
adaptive optics system. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey sample is compiled from
the literature and consists of 17 type-1 AGNs between 0.18 < z < 0.56 and 33
type-2 AGNs between 0.03 < z < 0.24. The new images reveal eight type-1 and
eight type-2 sources that are apparently undergoing mergers. These are strong
candidates of kpc-scale binary AGNs, because they show multiple components
separated between 0.6 and 12 kpc and often disturbed morphologies. Because most
of the type-1s are at higher redshifts than the type-2s, the higher merger
fraction of type-1s (47+/-20%) compared to that of type-2s (24+/-10%) can be
attributed to the general evolution of galaxy merger fraction with redshift.
Furthermore, we show that AGN mergers are outliers of the M_BH-sigma relation
because of over-estimated stellar velocity dispersions, illustrating the
importance of removing mergers from the samples defining the M_BH-sigma
relations. Finally, we find that the emission-line properties are
indistinguishable for spatially resolved and unresolved sources, emphasizing
that scenarios involving a single AGN can produce the same double-peaked line
profiles and they account for at least 70% of the double-peaked [O III] AGNs.

(from 1865 to 2005). The two stations with the longest time series of
temperature measurements (Lisbon and Coimbra) have been used to study the
dependence of the portuguese climate variations on the changes of both global
circulation and solar activity. Monthly averaged temperature series have been
analyzed together with monthly North-Atlantic Oscillation index data, sunspot
numbers and cosmic ray flux intensity. Different statistical methods (the
correlation analysis and the multiple regression analysis) were used. Our
results show that the temperature in Portugal depends not only on the
atmospheric variations in the studied region but also on the variations of the
solar parameters such as sunspot numbers and the cosmic rays flux intensity.
Also, the dependence of temperature on solar parameters is strong during the
cold season (November to February), while much weaker during the warm season.
For some months, strong correlations between the temperature variations of the
current month and the North-Atlantic Oscillation index values of the previous
month have been found. The correlation between climatic and solar parameters
shows up best on the decadal and decadal-to-centennial timescale. It is found
that the temperature correlates positively with the sunspot numbers and
negatively with the CR flux intensity throughout the year. Besides, the
absolute values of the correlation coefficients between the temperature and the
CR are higher than those between the temperature and the sunspot numbers. Our
results are consistent with some of the proposed mechanisms that relate solar
activity to Earth climate and could be explained through the effect of the
solar UV radiation and stratosphere-troposphere coupling or/and through the
effect of the CR particles on clouds and stratospheric and tropospheric
conditions.

Agents already present in the market may match early or wait for the small
group of new entrants. Despite the lack of discounting or risk aversion, this
perturbation creates incentives to match early and leave the market before the
new agents arrive. These incentives do not disappear as the market gets large.
Moreover, we identify a new adverse phenomenon in this setting: as markets get
large the probability of \emph{chaos} -- where no early matching scheme for
existing agents is robust to pairwise deviations -- approaches 1. These results
are independent of the distribution of agents' types and robust to asymmetries
between the two sides of the market. Our findings thus suggest that matching

emission at 6.2, 7.7, and 11.3 microns, indicating the presence of vigorous
star formation. For J1206, we find a steeply rising continuum and significant
[S IV] emission, suggesting that a moderately hard radiation field is powering
continuum emission from small dust grains. The strength of the [S IV] emission
also implies a sub-solar metallicity of ~ 0.5 Z_{Sun}, confirming published
rest-frame optical measurements. In J0901, the PAH lines have large rest-frame
equivalent widths (> 1 micron) and the continuum rises slowly with wavelength,
suggesting that any AGN contribution to L_{IR} is insignificant, in contrast to
the implications of optical emission-line diagnostics. Using [O III] line flux
as a proxy for AGN strength, we estimate that the AGN in J0901 provides only a
small fraction of its mid-infrared continuum flux. By combining the detection
of [Ar II] with an upper limit on [Ar III] emission, we infer a metallicity of
> 1.3 Z_{Sun}. This work highlights the importance of combining rest-frame
optical and mid-IR spectroscopy in order to understand the detailed properties
of star-forming galaxies at high redshift.

sunspot brightness and the strength of molecular absorption lines were also
seen. This trend was seen to continue in observations of the first sunspots of
the new solar Cycle 24, and extrapolating a linear fit to this trend would lead
to only half the number of spots in Cycle 24 compared to Cycle 23, and imply
virtually no sunspots in Cycle 25.
  We examined synoptic observations from the NSO Kitt Peak Vacuum Telescope and
initially (with 4000 spots) found a change in sunspot brightness which roughly
agreed with the infrared observations. A more detailed examination (with 13,000
spots) of both spot brightness and line-of-sight magnetic flux reveals that the
relationship of the sunspot magnetic fields with spot brightness and size
remain constant during the solar cycle. There are only small temporal
variations in the spot brightness, size, and line-of-sight flux seen in this
larger sample. Because of the apparent disagreement between the two data sets,
we discuss how the infrared spectral line provides a uniquely direct

boundary in the Ising regime of low vacancy density, but intersect the phase
boundary when the magnetic transition is mainly driven by a proliferation of
vacancies. Adiabatic heating occurs in moving away from the phase boundary. The
isentropes of the half-filled FHM have a relatively simple structure, running
parallel to the temperature axis in the paramagnetic phase, and then curving
upwards as the antiferromagnetic transition occurs. However, in the doped case,
where two magnetic phase boundaries are crossed, the isentrope topology is
considerably more complex.

important peculiarity of the full Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes equations is the
use of the full continuity equation required even for a binary mixture of
incompressible liquids, firstly, due to dependence of mixture density on
concentration and, secondly, due to strong concentration gradients at liquids'
interfaces. Using the multiple-scale method we separate the physical processes
occurring on different time scales and, ultimately, provide a strict derivation

employed for a thermo/hydro-dynamic analysis of the multiphase systems with
strongly evolving and diffusing interfacial boundaries, i.e. for the processes

discuss the potential of the LHC for discovering the new scalars. We focus on
the $\phi^+\phi^-$ and $\phi^{\pm} \phi^0$ production and the subsequent decay
of the charged scalar to a charged lepton and the SLIM which appears as missing

find that it can exceed $5 \sigma$ at 30 ${\rm fb}^{-1}$ for the 14 TeV run at
the LHC. We comment on the possibility of extracting the flavor structure of
the Yukawa couplings which also determine the neutrino mass matrix. Finally, we
discuss the prospects of this search at the current 7 TeV run of the LHC.

well as lateral scattering of these contributions. The buildup, which is
experimentally observed in higher energy depth dose curves, is modeled by
inclusion of two different origins: 1. Secondary reaction protons with a
contribution of ca. 65 % of the buildup (for monoenergetic protons). 2. Landau
tails as well as Gaussian type of fluctuations for range straggling effects.
All parameters of the model for initially monoenergetic proton beams have been

initially inhomogeneous distribution of passive tracers. As a quantitative
measure of mixing we adopt the $H^{-1}$ norm of the scalar fluctuation field,
equivalent to the (square-root of the) variance of a low-pass filtered image of
the tracer concentration field. First we establish that this is a useful gauge
even in the absence of molecular diffusion: its vanishing as $t --> \infty$ is
evidence of the stirring flow's mixing properties in the sense of ergodic
theory. Then we derive absolute limits on the total amount of mixing, as a
function of time, on a periodic spatial domain with a prescribed instantaneous
stirring energy or stirring power budget. We subsequently determine the flow
field that instantaneously maximizes the decay of this mixing measure---when
such a flow exists. When no such `steepest descent' flow exists (a possible but
non-generic situation) we determine the flow that maximizes the growth rate of
the $H^{-1}$ norm's decay rate. This local-in-time optimal stirring strategy is
implemented numerically on a benchmark problem and compared to an optimal
control approach using a restricted set of flows. Some significant challenges
for analysis are outlined.

interladder coupling within a mean-field or quantum Monte Carlo approach, we
compute the transition temperature of triplet condensation and its
corresponding antiferromagnetic order parameter. Existing experimental
measurements are discussed and compared to our theoretical results. Furthermore
we compute, using time dependent DMRG, the dynamical correlations of a single
spin ladder. Our results allow to directly describe the inelastic neutron
scattering cross section up to high energies. We focus on the evolution of the
spectra with the magnetic field and compare their behavior for different

different analytical approaches such as the mapping onto a spin chain, a
Luttinger liquid (LL) or onto a t-J model. For values of parameters for which

with an environment, and may be written in a variety of forms. Time-independent
or memoryless master equations, in particular, can be cast in the well-known
Lindblad form. Any time-local master equation, Markovian or non-Markovian, may
in fact also be written in a Lindblad-like form. A diagonalisation procedure
results in a unique, and in this sense canonical, representation of the
equation, which may be used to fully characterize the non-Markovianity of the
time evolution. Recently, several different measures of non-Markovianity have
been presented which reflect, to varying degrees, the appearance of negative
decoherence rates in the Lindblad-like form of the master equation. We
therefore propose using the negative decoherence rates themselves, as they
appear in the canonical form of the master equation, to completely characterize
non-Markovianity. The advantages of this are especially apparent when more than
one decoherence channel is present. We show that a measure proposed by Rivas et
al. is a surprisingly simple function of the canonical decoherence rates, and
give an example of a master equation that is non-Markovian for all times t>0,
but to which nearly all proposed measures are blind. We also give necessary and
sufficient conditions for trace distance and volume measures to witness
non-Markovianity, in terms of the Bloch damping matrix.
