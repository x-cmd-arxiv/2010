much larger observation bandwidth and will be capable of pointing multiple
beams simultaneously. Obtaining the sensitivity, resolution and dynamic range
supported by the receivers requires the development of new signal processing
techniques for array and atmospheric calibration as well as new imaging
techniques that are both more accurate and computationally efficient since data
volumes will be much larger. This paper provides a tutorial overview of
existing image formation techniques and outlines some of the future directions
needed for information extraction from future radio telescopes. We describe the
imaging process from measurement equation until deconvolution, both as a
Fourier inversion problem and as an array processing estimation problem. The
latter formulation enables the development of more advanced techniques based on
state of the art array processing. We demonstrate the techniques on simulated
and measured radio telescope data.

scenario for an observed binary or triple system containing one or more merger
products or, alternatively, to rule out the possibility of a dynamical origin.
Our method relies on an analytic prescription for energy conservation during
stellar encounters. With this, observations of the multiple star system
containing the merger product(s) can be used to work backwards in order to
constrain the initial orbital energies of any single, binary or triple systems
that went into the encounter. The initial semi-major axes of the orbits provide
an estimate for the collisional cross section and therefore the time-scale for
the encounter to occur in its host cluster. We have applied our analytic
prescription to observed binary and triple systems containing blue stragglers,
in particular the triple system S1082 in M67 and the period distribution of the
blue straggler binaries in NGC 188. We have shown that both S1082 and most of
the blue straggler binaries in NGC 188 could have a dynamical origin, and that
encounters involving triples could be a significant contributor to BS
populations in old open clusters. In general, our results suggest that
encounters involving triples could make up a significant fraction of those
dynamical interactions that result in stellar mergers, in particular encounters
that produce multiple star systems containing one or more blue stragglers.

previously found that a steady state protoplanetary disk with an outer boundary
truncated by photoevaporation by an external massive star would have a steep
surface density profile. In a completely novel way, we have adapted numerical
methods for solving propagating phase change problems to astrophysical disks.
We find that a one-dimensional time-dependent disk model that self-consistently
tracks the location of the outer boundary produces shallower profiles than
those predicted for a steady state disk. The resulting surface density profiles
have a radial dependence of Sigma(r) \alpha r^(-1.25+0.88-0.33) with a
power-law exponent that in some models becomes as large as ~Sigma(r) \alpha
r^(-2.1). The evolutionary timescales of the model disks can be sped up or
slowed down by altering the amount of far-ultraviolet flux or the viscosity
parameter alpha. Slowing the evolutionary timescale by decreasing the incident
far ultraviolet flux, or similarly by decreasing alpha, can help to grow
planets more rapidly, but at the cost of decreased migration timescales.
Although they similarly affect relevant timescales, changes in the far
ultraviolet flux or alpha produce disks with drastically different outer radii.
Despite their differences, these disks are all characterized by outward mass
transport, mass loss at the outer edge, and a truncated outer boundary. The
transport of mass from small to large radii can potentially prevent the rapid
inward migration of Jupiter and Saturn, while at the same time supply enough
mass to the outer regions of the disk for the formation of Uranus and Neptune.

hub. If there are $N$ spokes, we show that a quantum walk can find an extra
edge connecting two of the spokes or a spoke with a loop on it in $O(\sqrt{N})$
steps. We initially find that if all of the spokes have loops except one, the
walk will not find the spoke without a loop, but this can be fixed if we choose
the phase with which the particle is reflected from the vertex without the
loop. Consequently, quantum walks can, under some circumstances, be used to
find structural anomalies in graphs.

$w$-NAF condition, i.e., in an expansion every block of $w$ consecutive digits

formula for the number of occurrence of a digit in the $w$-NAFs of all elements
of $\Z[\tau]$ in some region (e.g. a disc). The main term coincides with the
full block length analysis, but a periodic fluctuation in the second order term

April 2010 (428-432)] examine in detail the spin-orbit coupling in the
semiclassical hydrogenic atom, and identify a need to account for non-Coulomb
forces not included in the standard analysis. Kholmetskii, et al., showed that
the experimentally-measured coupling continues to be obtained when the new
forces are incorporated in the analysis. This requires that the change in
orbital radius due to non-Coulomb forces is also properly accounted for. In
response to a comment, Kholmetskii, et al., showed that the
experimentally-measured coupling continues to be obtained when so-called
""hidden momentum"" forces are also included. However it has been postulated that
when hidden momentum is nonvanishing, a corresponding hidden energy must also
be present, that was not included in the total energy by Kholmetskii, et al.
Hidden energy is postulated necessary to obtaining a relativistically covariant
description. Inclusion of hidden energy leads to disagreement with the
experimentally-determined spin-orbit coupling magnitude if the Bohr postulate,
that orbital angular momentum is quantized in whole multiples of the reduced
Planck constant, is assumed to apply to kinetic momentum alone. The empirical
result may be recovered in the semiclassical picture and using the general
approach developed by Kholmetskii, et al., if the Bohr postulate is
reinterpreted to apply to orbital angular momentum that consists of hidden as
well as kinetic momentum.

providing a better theoretical foundation, suggesting formal generalization

wavefunctions only, the angle for which the yield is suppressed will remain the

consider specific choices of orbit and/or central body. Our main findings are:
(1) For charges held static at a large distance from the central body, the
self-force is independent of the central body type in the minimally coupled
scalar case and the electromagnetic case (but dependent in the nonminimally
coupled scalar case); (2) For circular orbits about a thin-shell spacetime in
the scalar case, the fractional change in self-force from a black hole
spacetime is much larger for the radial (conservative) force than for the
angular (dissipative) force; and (3) the radial self-force difference (between
these spacetimes) agrees closely for a static charge and a circular orbit of
the same radius.

late time, but the description has no quantitative significance without some
meaningful input on the parton distributions at earlier time. Thus observations
of particle spectra and correlations have definitive implications on the
partonic processes at all transverse momenta. After presenting a general review
of the subject at the Workshop, I selected two topics in nuclear collisions for
more detailed discussion, which are summarized here. One is on the azimuthal
anisotropy at low $p_T$ due to hard or semihard scattering of partons that
create ridges with or without triggers. The ridge particles are the products of
recombination of thermal partons enhanced by the energy loss of hard or
semihard partons. Their $\phi$ dependence at midrapidity can be determined
essentially from geometry. The other topic is on the scaling behavior in $\phi$
and centrality at high $p_T$, where the hadronization process is dominated by
TS and SS recombination. The relevant RHIC data are found to have the same
scaling behavior. But at LHC such scaling is badly broken at $p_T \sim 10$
GeV/c if two-jet recombination is important. At the end of this article some
comments are made to relate our study of the effects of semihard partons to the
observation of minijets in the analyses of STAR data.

atomistic off-lattice Monte Carlo simulations in the semi-grand canonical

Cowley [Phys. Rev. B 77, 669 (1950)] is used to quantify the degree of
ordering. In agreement with experiments a strong ordering tendency in the Cr
distribution at low Cr concentrations (~< 5%) is observed, as manifested in
negative values of the SRO parameters. For intermediate Cr concentrations (5%
~< c_Cr ~< 15%) the SRO parameter for the alpha-phase goes through a minimum,
but at the solubility limit the alpha-phase still displays a rather strong SRO.
In thermodynamic equilibrium for concentrations within the two-phase region the
SRO parameter measured over the entire sample therefore comprises the
contributions from both the alpha and alpha-prime phases. If both of these
contributions are taken into account, it is possible to quantitatively
reproduce the experimental results and interpret their physical implications.
It is thereby shown that the inversion of the SRO observed experimentally is
due to the formation of stable (supercritical) alpha-prime precipitates. It is
not related to the loss of SRO in the alpha-phase or to the presence of
unstable (subcritical) Cr precipitates in the alpha-phase.

cooperator domains to recover the possible intrude of defectors hence supports
cooperation. In the other case the temporary restrained learning activity
generates a cyclic dominance between defector and cooperator strategies, which
helps to maintain the diversity of strategies via propagating waves. The

5-dimensional round handles appear extensively as the building blocks in
cobordisms between 4-manifolds, whereas 4-dimensional round handles are the
building blocks of broken Lefschetz fibrations on them. The purpose of this
article is to shed more light on these interactions. We prove that if X and X'
are cobordant closed smooth 4-manifolds with the same euler characteristics,
and if one of them is simply-connected, then there is a cobordism between them
which is composed of round 2-handles only, and therefore one can pass from one
to the other via a sequence of generalized logarithmic transforms along tori.
As a corollary, we obtain a new proof of a theorem of Iwase's, which is a
4-dimensional analogue of the Lickorish-Wallace theorem for 3-manifolds: Every
closed simply-connected 4-manifold can be produced by a surgery along a
disjoint union of tori contained in a connected sum of copies of CP^2, -CP^2
and S^1 x S^3. These answer some of the open problems posted by Ron Stern,
while suggesting more constraints on the cobordisms in consideration. We also
use round handles to show that every infinite family of mutually
non-diffeomorphic closed smooth oriented simply-connected 4-manifolds in the
same homeomorphism class constructed up to date consists of members that become
diffeomorphic after one stabilization with S^2 x S^2 if members are all
non-spin, and with S^2 x S^2 # -CP^2 if they are spin. In particular, we show
that simple cobordisms exist between knot surgered manifolds. We then show that
generalized logarithmic transforms can be seen as standard logarithmic
transforms along fiber components of broken Lefschetz fibrations, and show how
changing the smooth structures on a fixed homeomorphism class of a closed
smooth 4-manifold can be realized as relevant modifications of a broken
Lefschetz fibration on it.

which has a diameter of ~0.76 arcsec. The sigma inside 0.2 arcsec reaches ~400

derive the mean rate, and then the coverage gain (and mean rate loss) from
static frequency reuse. We compare our coverage predictions to the grid model
and an actual base station deployment, and observe that the proposed model is
pessimistic (a lower bound on coverage) whereas the grid model is optimistic,

the proposed model may better capture the increasingly opportunistic and dense

of 4.8 standard deviations. The identification of the source counterparts is
pursued using two strategies: the analysis of field observations of soft X-ray
instruments and cross-correlation of our catalogue with source databases.The
survey covers 50% of the sky to a 15--150 keV flux limit of 1.0 x 10^-11 erg
s^-1 cm^-2 and 9.2 x 10^-12 erg s^-1 cm^-2 for |b|< 10 degrees and |b|> 10

includes 1079 (86%) hard X-ray sources with an associated counterpart (26 with
a double association and 2 with a triple association) and 177 BAT excesses
(14%) that still lack a counterpart. The distribution of the BAT sources among
the different object classes consists of 19% Galactic sources, 57%
extragalactic sources, and 10% sources with a counterpart at softer energies
whose nature has not yet been determined. About half of the BAT associated
sources lack a counterpart in the ROSAT catalogues. This suggests that either
moderate or strong absorption may be preventing their detection in the ROSAT

investigated the water jet cleaning process. Very high speed water jets
(~80-200 m/s) are typically used in such cleaning operations. These jets
diffuse in the surrounding atmosphere by the process of air entrainment and
this contributes to the spreading of the jet and subsequent decay of pressure.
Estimation of this pressure decay and subsequent placement of the cleaning
object is of paramount importance in manufacturing and material processing
industries. Also, the pressure distribution on the cleaning surface needs to be
assessed in order to understand and optimize the material removal process. In
an industrial setting, experimental study is performed to formulate the
pressure characteristics. It has shown that the decay of stagnation pressure
along the axial direction is linear. It also revealed that no cleaning is
possible at radial locations greater than 1.68D from the centerline. Numerical
simulations are performed to capture the process of air entrainment in the jet
and the subsequent pressure characteristics. The simulation results are found
to correctly predict the experimental data. Moreover, a theoretical model for
evaluating the optimal and critical stand-off distances has also been derived.
Based on our results, we found that the optimal stand-off distance in cleaning
operations is ~5D and the jet looses its cleaning ability at axial distances
greater than ~26D.

broad emission lines in active galaxies. This technique informs our views of
how galaxies and their central black holes coevolve. Unfortunately, there are
many outstanding uncertainties associated with these ""virial"" mass estimates.
One of these comes from using the accretion luminosity to infer a size for the
broad-line region. Incorporating the new sample of low-luminosity active
galaxies from our recent monitoring campaign at Lick Observatory, we
recalibrate the radius-luminosity relation with tracers of the accretion
luminosity other than the optical continuum. We find that the radius of the
broad-line region scales as the square root of the X-ray and Hbeta
luminosities, in agreement with recent optical studies. On the other hand, the
scaling appears to be marginally steeper with narrow-line luminosities. This is
consistent with a previously observed decrease in the ratio of narrow-line to
X-ray luminosity with increasing total luminosity. The radius of the broad-line
region correlates most tightly with Hbeta luminosity, while the X-ray and
narrow-line relations both have comparable scatter of a factor of two. These
correlations provide useful alternative virial BH masses in objects with no
detectable optical/UV continuum emission, such as high-redshift galaxies with
broad emission lines, radio-loud objects, or local active galaxies with
galaxy-dominated continua.

that Per-Bolo 58 could be a very low luminosity protostar, however. We utilize
radiative transfer models to determine the best-fitting FHSC and protostar
models to the spectral energy distribution and 2.9 mm visibilities of Per-Bolo
58. The source is consistent with a FHSC with some source of lower opacity
through the envelope allowing 24 micron emission to escape; a small outflow
cavity or a cavity in the envelope are both possible. While we are unable to
rule out the presence of a protostar, if present it would be one of the lowest

also used near-IR colors and emission line ratios, when available, to also
estimate extinction. In the course of this survey, we observed the spectra of
10 FU Orionis-like objects, including 2 new ones, as well as 3 Herbig Ae type
stars among our Class I YSOs. We used photospheric absorption lines, when
available, to estimate the spectral type of each target. Although most targets
are late type stars, there are several A and F-type stars in our sample.
Notably, we found no A or F class stars in the Taurus-Auriga or Perseus star
forming regions. There are several cases where the observed CO and/or water
absorption bands are deeper than expected from the photospheric spectral type.
We find a correlation between the appearance of the reflection nebula, which
traces the distribution of material on very large scales, and the near-IR
spectrum, which probes smaller scales. The spectra of the components of
spatially resolved protostellar binaries tend to be very similar. In particular
both components tend to have similar veiling and H_2 emission, inconsistent
with random selection from the sample as a whole. There is a strong correlation

an activity network arising in a number of important security-related
applications. It is classically formulated as a bilevel maximin problem
representing an ""interdictor"" and an ""evader"". The evader tries to move from a
source node to the target node along a path of the least cost while the
interdictor attempts to frustrate this motion by cutting edges or nodes. The
interdiction objective is to find the optimal set of edges to cut given that
there is a finite interdiction budget and the interdictor must move first. We
reformulate the interdiction problem for stochastic evaders by introducing a
model in which the evader follows a Markovian random walk guided by the
least-cost path to the target. This model can represent incomplete knowledge
about the evader, and the resulting model is a nonlinear 0-1 optimization
problem. We then introduce an optimization heuristic based on betweenness
centrality that can rapidly find high-quality interdiction solutions by
providing a global view of the network.

large amount of recent and new data clearly indicates that breakup hinders the
fusion at near and below the Coulomb barrier energies. However, clear evidence
for the halo enhancements, seems to over ride the breakup hindrance at lower
energies, owing, to a large extent, to the extended matter density
distribution. In particular we report here that at sub-barrier energies the
fusion cross section of the Borromean two-neutron halo nucleus $^{6}$He with
the actinide nucleus $^{238}$U is significantly enhanced compared to the fusion
of a no-halo $^{6}$He. This conclusion differs from that of the original work,
where it was claimed that no such enhancement ensues. This sub-barrier fusion
enhancement was also observed in the $^{6}$He + $^{209}$% Bi system. The role
of the corresponding easily excitable low lying dipole pygmy resonance in these

digitized signal in a four-level quantization brings us information about the
bias voltage and the variance, which reflects the power of the input signal.
Comparison of the variances in {\it hot} and {\it sky} circumstances yields
$T_{\rm sys}$ without a power meter. We performed test experiments using the
Kagoshima 6-m radio telescope and a 2-bit ADC to verify this method. Linearity
in the power-variance relation was better than 99% within the dynamic range of
10 dB. Digitally measured $T_{\rm sys}$ coincided with that of conventional
measurement with a power meter in 1.8-% difference or less for elevations of
$10^{\circ} - 88^{\circ}$. No significant impact was found by the bias voltages
within the range between -3.7 and +12.8% with respect to the threshold voltage.
The proposed method is available for existing interferometers that have a
multi-level ADC, and release us from troubles caused by power meters.

resummation schemes must be used. We describe a simple implementation, based on
a 1-loop ""direct steepest-descent"" resummation for the 2-halo contribution that
allows fast numerical computations, and we check that we obtain a good match to
simulations at low and high $k$. Our simple implementation already fares better
than standard 1-loop perturbation theory on large scales and simple fits to the
power spectrum at high $k$, with a typical accuracy of 1% on large scales and
10% on small scales. We obtain similar results for the two-point correlation
function. However, there remains room for improvement on the transition scale
between the 2-halo and 1-halo contributions, which may be the most difficult
regime to describe.

stabilizing the core against fragmentation into Jeans-mass objects or
alternatively, the observed kinematics could indicate a high level of dynamics.
We present IRAM 30m single-dish (HCO+ and H13CO+) and IRAM PdBI high
angular-resolution observations of dense gas tracers (H13CO+ and H13CN) to
reveal the kinematics of molecular gas at scales from 0.03 to 0.1 pc. Radiative
transfer modeling shows that H13CO+ is depleted within the envelopes of massive
protostars and traces the bulk of material surrounding the protostars rather
than their inner envelopes. H13CN shows a better correspondence with the peak
of the continuum emission, possibly due to abundance anomalies and specific
chemistry in the close vicinity of massive protostars. Analyzing the
line-widths we show that the observed line-dispersion of H13CO+ at the scale of
MDCs is smaller than expected from the quasi-static, turbulent-core model. At
large-scales, global organized bulk motions are identified for 3 of the MDCs.
At small-scales, several spectral components are identified in all MDCs showing
filamentary structures and intrinsic velocity gradients towards the continuum
peaks. The dynamics of these flows show diversity among the sample and we link
this to the specific fragmentation properties of the MDCs. No clear evidence is
found for a turbulence regulated, equilibrium scenario within the sample of
MDCs. We propose a picture in which MDCs are not in equilibrium and their
dynamics is governed by small-scale converging flows, which may initiate
star-formation via their shears.

previously been studied for simple and complex fluids, granular matter,

shape measures that are based on strong mathematical theorems and easily
computed for polygonal and polyhedral bodies such as free volume cells (Voronoi
cells). They characterize the local structure beyond the two-point correlation
function and are suitable to define indices $0\leq \beta_\nu^{a,b}\leq 1$ of
local anisotropy. Here, we analyze the statistics of Minkowski tensors for
configurations of simple liquid models, including the ideal gas (Poisson point

fluid. We show that Minkowski tensors provide a robust characterization of
local anisotropy, which ranges from $\beta_\nu^{a,b}\approx 0.3$ for vapor
phases to $\beta_\nu^{a,b}\to 1$ for ordered solids. We find that for fluids,
local anisotropy decreases monotonously with increasing free volume and
randomness of particle positions. Furthermore, the local anisotropy indices
$\beta_\nu^{a,b}$ are sensitive to structural transitions in these simple
fluids, as has been previously shown in granular systems for the transition

range between 2 and 3, they are either assortative or disassortative. We

qualitatively the MFPT of trapping problem.

spherical droplet (or bubble) of the minority phase (near the coexistence

Extending the analysis of M. Schrader, P. Virnau, and K. Binder [Phys. Rev. E

spherical and cylindrical droplets and bubbles in the vapor-liquid case, and

Tolman length being independent on the sign of curvature. For the symmetric

all cases {and for a range of radii} R relevant for nucleation theory, gamma(R)
deviates strongly from gamma (Infinity) which can be accounted for by a term of

we extract source catalogues for the GAMA regions using elliptical Kron and
Petrosian matched apertures. We also calculate S\'ersic magnitudes for all
galaxies within the GAMA sample using SIGMA, a galaxy component modelling
wrapper for GALFIT 3. We compare the resultant photometry directly, and also
calculate the r band galaxy LF for all photometric datasets to highlight the
uncertainty introduced by the photometric method. We find that (1) Changing the
object detection threshold has a minor effect on the best-fitting Schechter
parameters of the overall population (M* +/- 0.055mag, {\alpha} +/- 0.014,
{\Phi}* +/- 0.0005 h^3 Mpc^{-3}). (2) An offset between datasets that use Kron
or Petrosian photometry regardless of the filter. (3) The decision to use
circular or elliptical apertures causes an offset in M* of 0.20mag. (4) The
best-fitting Schechter parameters from total-magnitude photometric systems
(such as SDSS modelmag or S\'ersic magnitudes) have a steeper faint-end slope
than photometry dependent on Kron or Petrosian magnitudes. (5) Our Universe's
total luminosity density, when calculated using Kron or Petrosian r-band
photometry, is underestimated by at least 15%.

determine the most appropriate form of dust obscuration correction via
application of a range of extinction laws drawn from the literature as applied
to Halpha, [O{II}] and UV luminosities. These corrections are applied to a
sample of 31,508 galaxies from the GAMA survey at z < 0.35. We consider several
different obscuration curves, including those of Milky Way, Calzetti (2001) and
Fischera and Dopita (2005) curves and their effects on the observed
luminosities. At the core of this technique is the observed Balmer decrement,
and we provide a prescription to apply optimal obscuration corrections using
the Balmer decrement. We carry out an analysis of the star formation history
(SFH) using stellar population synthesis tools to investigate the evolutionary
history of our sample of galaxies as well as to understand the effects of
variation in the Initial Mass Function (IMF) and the effects this has on the
evolutionary history of galaxies. We find that the Fischera and Dopita (2005)
obscuration curve with an R_{v} value of 4.5 gives the best agreement between
the different SFR indicators. The 2200A feature needed to be removed from this
curve to obtain complete consistency between all SFR indicators suggesting that
this feature may not be common in the average integrated attenuation of galaxy
emission. We also find that the UV dust obscuration is strongly dependent on
the SFR.

faster than the KSW bispectrum estimator, at the resolution of the Wilkinson

with Gaussianity. Although the constrainsts imposed on fNL are less stringent

parameter Hawking radiating black hole configurations. The system is
characterized by an ensemble of arbitrary mass and radiation frequency of the

intrinsic geometric description exhibits an intriguing set of exact pair
correction functions and global correlation lengths. We investigate the nature
of the constant amplitude radiation and find that it's not stable under
fluctuations of the mass and frequency. Subsequently, the consideration of the
York model decreasing amplitude radiation demonstrates that thermodynamic
fluctuations are globally stable in the small frequency region. In connection
with quantum gravity refinements, we take an account of the logarithmic
correction into the constant amplitude and York amplitude over the Hawking
radiation. In both considerations, we notice that the nature of the possible
parametric fluctuations may precisely be ascertained without any approximation.
In the frequency domain $w \in (0, \infty)$, we observe that both the local and
the global thermodynamic fluctuations of the radiation energy flux are stable
in the s-channel. The intrinsic geometry exemplifies a definite stability
character to the thermodynamic fluctuations, and up to finitely many
topological defects on the parametric surface, the notion remains almost the
same for both the constant amplitude and the York model. The Gaussian
fluctuations over equilibrium radiation energy flux and fluctuating horizon
configurations accomplish a well-defined, non-degenerate, curved and regular

in order to obtain an explicit comparison with the standard analysis of the
infrared contributions, occurring in the relativistically covariant
perturbative formulation of Quantum Electrodynamics. Moller operators,
preserving respectively the Hilbert scalar product, for the Coulomb-gauge
models, and an indefinite metric, for the models formulated in Feynman's gauge,
are obtained in the presence of an infrared cutoff, after the removal of an
adiabatic switching and with the aid of a suitable mass renormalization. In the
presence of a dipole approximation, spurious contributions to the infrared
factors are shown to necessarily arise in Feynman's gauge, with respect both to
the Coulomb-gauge model and to the amplitudes of Quantum Electrodynamics, and
the connection of this result with a recent work on the Gupta-Bleuler
formulation of non-relativistic models is discussed. It is finally proven that
by dropping the dipole approximation and adopting an expansion around a fixed
charged particle four-momentum, first introduced and employed in the study of
the infrared problem by Bloch and Nordsieck, the infrared diagrammatic is fully
reproduced and spurious low-energy effects are avoided.

by using, e.g., Jacobi coordinates the situation is much more involved for the

holonomy reduction}. We suggest that the configuration space may be considered
as the reduced holonomy bundle with a connection induced by the mechanical
connection. Using the fact that for the special case of the three-body problem,
the holonomy group is SO(2) (as opposed to SO(3) like in systems with more than
three bodies) we obtain a holonomy reduced configuration space of topology $
\mathbf{R}_+^3 \times S^1$. The dynamics then takes place on the cotangent
bundle over the holonomy reduced configuration space. On this phase space there
is an $S^1$ symmetry action coming from the conserved reduced angular momentum
which can be reduced using the standard symplectic reduction method. Using a
theorem by Arnold it follows that the resulting symmetry reduced phase space is
again a natural mechanical phase space, i.e. a cotangent bundle. This is
different from what is obtained from the usual approach where symplectic
reduction is used from the outset. This difference is discussed in some detail,
and a connection between the reduced dynamics of a triatomic molecule and the
motion of a charged particle in a magnetic field is established.

(Delta log M/L_B=(-0.76+-0.01)z=(-2.27+-0.03)log(1+z)) for field galaxies. The
FP residuals correlate with galaxy mass and become progressively negative at
low masses. The effect is visible at z>=0.7 for cluster galaxies and at z>=0.5

find that the half-luminosity radius for a galaxy with a dynamical or stellar
mass of 2x10^11 Msol varies as (1+z)^{-1.0+-0.3} for both cluster and field
galaxies. At the same time, stellar velocity dispersions grow with redshift, as
(1+z)^{0.59+-0.10} at constant dynamical mass, and as (1+z)^{0.34+- 0.14} at
constant stellar mass. The measured size evolution reduces to Re (1+z)^{-0.5+-
0.2} and sigma (1+z)^{0.41+-0.08}, at fixed dynamical masses, and Re
(1+z)^{-0.68+-0.4} and sigma (1+z)^{0.19+-0.10}, at fixed stellar masses, when
the progenitor bias (galaxies that locally are of spectroscopic early-type, but
not very old, disappear from the EDisCS high-redshift sample; these galaxies
tend to be large in size) is taken into account. Taken together, the variations
in size and velocity dispersion imply that the luminosity evolution with
redshift derived from the zero point of the FP is somewhat milder than that
derived without taking these variations into account.

observations of nearby ultra-luminous IRAS galaxies, (U)LIRGs, have found that
exceptionally large gas column densities (N_H > 10^25 cm-2) can be present
across some of the very dense gaseous disks that are typically found in these
objects. They also proposed a diagnostic for finding such sources using CO and
HCN molecular lines. Given that such high column densities are expected to
absorb any X-ray luminous AGN, yielding Compton-thick sources, we set out
toexplore whether this can be discerned using X-ray observations. More
specifically we examine X-ray spectral observations of 14 sources in their
sample, using public Chandra observations (0.5-10 keV) for eleven sources as
well as BeppoSAX results (2-100 keV) from the literature for another three
sources. Our goal is to find candidate Compton-thick AGN and to check whether
the molecular line selection criterion is successful in selecting such systems.
X-ray spectroscopy reveals four candidate Compton-thick AGN of which half fall
within the high obscuration region in the molecular line ratio diagnostics. Of
the remaining five sources falling into the `high dust obscuration' box, one
(Mrk273) is highly obscured (N_H ~4x10^23 cm-2) while in the other four the
X-ray emission is most probably associated with star-forming processes rather
than an AGN on the basis of their X-ray and mid-infrared properties. Overall,
we argue that although this method as expected cannot recover all Compton-thick
AGN, there are no examples of X-ray luminous AGN inside that region that have
low obscuration, suggesting that this method is efficient in finding heavily
obscured AGN in dust-enshrouded star-forming galaxies. The above results bear
important implications for future joint ALMA and X-ray observations for the
detection of Compton-thick AGN.

total HI mass of ~6x10^9Msun within a projected distance of 350kpc. Deep
optical images show a disrupted satellite at the northern edge of the HI disk.
The observed rotation curve shows a prominent bump of about 50km/s (in the
plane of the disk) at r=1.3xR_25. This feature in the rotation curve occurs at
the radius where the HI surface density drops significantly and may be due to
large-scale streaming motions in the disk. We suspect that both the streaming
motions and the HI density distribution are the result of the
interaction/accretion with the disrupted satellite. Like in other galaxies with
wiggles and bumps in the rotation curve, HI scaling describes the observed
rotation curve best. We suggest that interactions create streaming motions and
features in the HI density distribution and that this is the reason for the
success of HI scaling in fitting such rotation curves.

equations are solved using continuation techniques for several different cases
of energetic bias at the surfaces, corresponding to linear and quadratic
solutal Marangoni effects.
  For purely diffusive transport, an increase in film thickness either
exponentially decreases the lateral instability or entirely stabilizes the
film. Including convective transport leads to a further destabilization as
compared to the purely diffusive case. In some cases the inclusion of
convective transport and the related widening of the range of available film
configurations (it is then able to change its surface profile) change the
stability behavior qualitatively.
  We furthermore present results regarding the dependence of the instability on
several other parameters, namely, the Reynolds number, the Surface tension
number and the ratio of the typical velocities of convective and diffusive

a heavy multiplet is integrated out. The first is an indirect level-repulsion

The second is a direct coupling contribution, which may arise from heavy vector
multiplets and can have any sign. We then apply these results to the sGoldstino
mass and study the implications for the vacuum metastability condition. We find
that the correction from heavy chiral multiplets is always negative and tends
to compromise vacuum metastability, whereas the contribution from heavy vector
multiplets is always positive and tends on the contrary to reinforce it. These
two effects are controlled respectively by Yukawa couplings and gauge charges,
which mix one heavy and two light fields respectively in the superpotential and
the Kahler potential. Finally we also comment on similar effects induced in
soft scalar masses when the heavy multiplets couple both to the visible and the

  with neutral Poissonian mutations II: Large or old families""",,,,"q-bio.PE math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider a neutral dynamical model of biological diversity, where
individuals live and reproduce independently. They have i.i.d. lifetime
durations (which are not necessarily exponentially distributed) and give birth
(singly) at constant rate b. Such a genealogical tree is usually called a
splitting tree, and the population counting process (N_t;t\ge 0) is a
homogeneous, binary Crump--Mode--Jagers process. We assume that individuals
independently experience mutations at constant rate \theta during their
lifetimes, under the infinite-alleles assumption: each mutation instantaneously
confers a brand new type, called allele, to its carrier. We are interested in
the allele frequency spectrum at time t, i.e., the number A(t) of distinct
alleles represented in the population at time t, and more specifically, the
numbers A(k,t) of alleles represented by k individuals at time t,
k=1,2,...,N_t. We mainly use two classes of tools: coalescent point processes
and branching processes counted by random characteristics. We provide explicit
formulae for the expectation of A(k,t) in a coalescent point process
conditional on population size, which apply to the special case of splitting
trees. We separately derive the a.s. limits of A(k,t)/N_t and of A(t)/N_t
thanks to random characteristics. Last, we separately compute the expected
homozygosity by applying a method characterizing the dynamics of the tree
distribution as the origination time of the tree moves back in time, in the
spirit of backward Kolmogorov equations.

Potential Index (MWPI) and a new two-channel GOES imager brightness temperature

assessment. The MWPI, a diagnostic nowcasting product, is designed to infer
attributes of a favorable microburst environment: large CAPE and a convective
mixed layer with a steep temperature lapse rate and low relative humidity in
the surface layer. These conditions foster intense convective downdrafts due to
evaporational cooling as precipitation descends in the sub-cloud layer. More
recently, a new application of the brightness temperature difference (BTD)

the BTD between GOES infrared channel 3 (water vapor) and channel 4 (thermal

scalar-tensor theories of gravity, and thus, related with $F(R)$ theories
through conformal transformation. The aim of the chapter is to extent several
results to the more realistic situation when radiation is included in the
cosmic budget particularly for studying the early time dynamics. Under mild
conditions on the potential we prove that the equilibrium points corresponding
to the non-negative local minima for $V(\phi)$ are asymptotically stable.
Normal forms are employed to obtain approximated solutions associated to the
inflection points and the strict degenerate local minimum of the potential. We
prove for arbitrary potentials and arbitrary coupling functions $\chi(\phi),$
of appropriate differentiable class, that the scalar field almost always
diverges into the past. It is designed a dynamical system adequate to studying
the stability of the critical points in the limit $|\phi|\to\infty.$ We obtain
there: radiation-dominated cosmological solutions; power-law scalar-field
dominated inflationary cosmological solutions; matter-kinetic-potential scaling
solutions and radiation-kinetic-potential scaling solutions. Using the
mathematical apparatus developed here, we investigate the important examples of
higher order gravity theories $F(R) = R + \alpha R^2$ (quadratic gravity) and
$F(R) =R^n.$ We illustrated both analytically and numerically our principal
results. In the case of quadratic gravity we prove, by an explicit computation

similar previously studied models with continuous transitions into columnar VBS

NGC 6764 with the Very Long Baseline Array at 1.6 and 4.9 GHz. These
observations have detected a ""core-jet"" structure and a possible weak
counterjet component at 1.6 GHz. The upper limits to the core and jet (1.6-4.9
GHz) spectral index are 0.6 and 0.3, respectively. Taken together with the high
brightness temperature of ~10^7 K for the core region, the radio emission
appears to be coming from a synchrotron jet. At a position angle of 25 degrees,
the parsec-scale jet seems to be pointing closely toward the western edge of
the southern kpc-scale bubble in NGC 6764. A real connection between the
parsec- and sub-kpc-scale emission would not only suggest the presence of a
curved jet, but also a close link between the AGN jet and the radio bubbles in
NGC 6764. We demonstrate that a precessing jet model can explain the radio
morphology from parsec- to sub-kpc scales, and the model best-fit parameters of
jet speed and orientation are fully consistent with the observed
jet-to-counterjet surface brightness ratio. The jet however appears to be
disrupted on scales of hundreds of parsecs, possibly due to interaction with
and entrainment of the interstellar medium gas, which subsequently leads to the
formation of bubbles. The jet energetics in NGC 6764 suggest that it would take
12-21 Myr to inflate the (southern) bubble. This timescale corresponds roughly
to the starburst episode that took place in NGC 6764 about 15-50 Myr ago, and
could be indicative of a close connection between jet formation and the
starburst activity in this galaxy.

counter-propagating electron beam, among these effects being electron-positron
pair creation. We discuss the range of laser pulse intensities of J > 5*10^22
W/cm2 combined with electron beam energies of tens of GeV. In this regime
multiple pairs may be generated from a single beam electron, some of the
newborn particles being capable of further pair production. Radiation
back-reaction prevents avalanche development and limits pair creation. The
system of integro-differential kinetic equations for electrons, positrons and
\gamma-photons is derived and solved numerically.
