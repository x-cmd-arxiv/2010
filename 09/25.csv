necessities towards industrial-strength service robotic systems. A major
challenge is to make the step from code-driven to model-driven systems. This is
essential to replace hand-crafted single-unit systems by systems composed out
of components with explicitly stated properties. Furthermore, this fosters
reuse by separating robotics knowledge from short-cycled implementational
technologies. Altogether, this is one but important step towards ""able"" robots.
This paper reports on a model-driven development process for robotic systems.
The process consists of a robotics metamodel with first explications of
non-functional properties. A model-driven toolchain based on Eclipse provides
the model transformation and code generation steps. It also provides design
time analysis of resource parameters (e.g. schedulability analysis of realtime
tasks) as a first step towards overall resource awareness in the development of
integrated robotic systems. The overall approach is underpinned by several real
world scenarios.

stars forming in the very dense, cold gas found in Giant Molecular Clouds
(GMCs). Simulating the evolution of an entire galaxy, however, is a
computational problem which covers many orders of magnitude, so many
simulations cannot reach densities high enough or temperatures low enough to
resolve this multiphase nature. Therefore, the formation of GMCs is not
captured and the resulting gas distribution is smooth, contrary to
observations. We investigate how star formation (SF) proceeds in simulated
galaxies when we obtain parsec-scale resolution and more successfully capture
the multiphase ISM. Both major mergers and the accretion of cold gas via
filaments are dominant contributors to a galaxy's total stellar budget and we
examine SF at high resolution in both of these contexts.

important consequences for the physics of high $T_c$ superconductors. On one

magnetic excitations (up to 300 meV) a major role in Cooper pairing in

two classes - proactive and reactive. Proactive routing is suitable for a
network with a fixed topology. On the other hand, reactive routing is more
suitable for a set of mobile nodes where routes are created on demand and there
is not much time to evaluate the worthiness of a route, the prime concern being
reachability due to constantly changing node positions. Sensor networks route
events of interest from source(s) to destination(s) where appropriate actions
could be taken. However, with mobile sensor nodes, it is not only important to
know the events but the location of the nodes generating the events. Most
sensor nodes are not equipped with expensive GPS or accurate RSSI computation
hardware to aid localization. Keeping these in view, we propose a modified
reactive routing algorithm, with added support for localization, to localize
mobile sensor nodes on the basis of information received from fixed sensor
nodes during mutual exchange of routing control packets. The accuracy of
localization depends on the ratio of the number of fixed nodes to the number of
mobile nodes and the topology of the fixed nodes. A typical application
scenario would be a mix of mobile nodes and fixed nodes, where fixed nodes know
their absolute location and the location of mobile nodes is derived from the
fixed nodes, in step with the reactive routing protocol in action. The modified
algorithm would be suitable for deployments where the approximate position of a
mobile node (i.e. the event location) is required but there is no external
support infrastructure available for localization.

fraction (~10%) of stars with masses 2 < M/Msun < 4 appear to be surrounded by
disks that have evolved from the initial optically thick accretion phase. We
identify four classes of such disks. These classes are based on spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) of excess emsission above photospheric levels: disks that
are (1) optically thin based on the magnitude of the observed excess emission
from 2 to 24 um; (2) optically thin in their inner regions (r< 20 AU) and
optically thick in their outer regions; (3) exhibit empty inner regions (r < 10
AU) and optically thin emission in their outer regions; and (4) exhibit empty
inner regions and optically thick outer regions. We discuss, and assess the
merits and liabilities of, proposed explanations for disks exhibiting these SED
types and suggest additional observations that would test these proposals.

detected in 114 targets. Based on 61 galaxies observed with equal beam sizes
the ^{12}CO 3-2/1-0 integrated line intensity ratio R_{31} is found to vary
from 0.2 to 1.9, with an average value of 0.81. No correlations are found for
R_{31} to Hubble type and far infrared luminosity. Possible indications for a
correlation with inclination angle and the 60mum/100mum color temperature of
the dust are not significant. Higher R_{31} ratios than in ``normal'' galaxies,
hinting at enhanced molecular excitation, may be found in galaxies hosting
active galactic nuclei. Even higher average values are determined for galaxies
with bars or starbursts, the latter being identified by the ratio of infrared
luminosity versus isophotal area, log[(L_{FIR}/L_{SUN})/(D_{25}/kpc)^2)] >
7.25. (U)LIRGs are found to have the highest averaged R_{31} value. This may be
a consequence of particularly vigorous star formation activity, triggered by
galaxy interaction and merger events. The nuclear CO luminosities are slightly
sublinearly correlated with the global FIR luminosity in both the ^{12}CO J =
3-2 and the 1-0 lines. The slope of the log-log plots rises with compactness of
the respective galaxy subsample, indicating a higher average density and a
larger fraction of thermalized gas in distant luminous galaxies. While linear
or sublinear correlations for the ^{12}CO J = 3-2 line can be explained, if the
bulk of the observed J = 3-2 emission originates from molecular gas with
densities below the critical one, the case of the ^{12}CO J = 1-0 line with its
small critical density remains a puzzle.

present a generalized Lagrangian from which it can be derived. We then
specialize to the case in which the quadrupole moment is adiabatically induced

show how the adiabatic dynamics for the quadrupole can be incorporated into our

equivalent photons whose amplitude follows from the Lorentz transformation of
the particle rest frame Coulomb field into the IMF and from the conservation of
the electromagnetic current. We evaluate in a model independent way the

the bulk of the EMC effect for x\le 0.5 where Fermi motion effects are small.

production in longitudinally polarized p+p collisions at $\sqrt{s}$=200 GeV.
Photons and charged particles were measured at midrapidity $|\eta| < 0.35$ with
the requirement of a high-momentum ($>2$ GeV/$c$) photon in each event.
Measured event structure is compared with {\sc pythia} and {\sc geant}
simulations. The shape of jets and the underlying event were well reproduced at
this collision energy. For the measurement of jet $A_{LL}$, photons and charged
particles were clustered with a seed-cone algorithm to obtain the cluster $p_T$
sum ($p_T^{\rm reco}$). The effect of detector response and the underlying
events on $p_T^{\rm reco}$ was evaluated with the simulation. The production
rate of reconstructed jets is satisfactorily reproduced with the NLO pQCD jet
production cross section. For $4 < p_T^{\rm reco} < 12$ GeV/$c$ with an average
beam polarization of $< P > = 49%$ we measured $A_{LL} = -0.0014 \pm
0.0037^{\rm stat}$ at the lowest $p_T^{\rm reco}$ bin (4-5 GeV/$c$) and
$-0.0181 \pm 0.0282^{\rm stat}$ at the highest $p_T^{\rm reco}$ bin (10-12
GeV/$c$) with a beam polarization scale error of 9.4% and a $\pT$ scale error
of 10%. Jets in the measured $p_T^{\rm reco}$ range arise primarily from
hard-scattered gluons with momentum fraction $0.02 < x < 0.3$ according to {\sc
pythia}. The measured $A_{LL}$ is compared with predictions that assume various
$\Delta G(x)$ distributions based on the GRSV parameterization. The present
result imposes the limit $-1.1 < \int_{0.02}^{0.3}dx \Delta G(x, \mu^2 = 1 {\rm

relativity, in the highly relativistic, extreme mass-ratio regime for spinning
black holes. These resonances occur when the ratio of polar and radial orbital
frequencies, which is slowly evolving under the influence of gravitational
radiation reaction, passes through a low order rational number. At such points,
the adiabatic approximation to the orbital evolution breaks down, and there is
a brief but order unity correction to the inspiral rate. Corrections to the
gravitational wave signal's phase due to resonance effects scale as the square
root of the inverse of mass of the small body, and thus become large in the
extreme-mass-ratio limit, dominating over all other post-adiabatic effects. The
resonances make orbits more sensitive to changes in initial data (though not
quite chaotic), and are genuine non-perturbative effects that are not seen at
any order in a standard post-Newtonian expansion. Our results apply to an
important potential source of gravitational waves, the gradual inspiral of
white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes into much more massive black holes.
It is hoped to exploit observations of these sources to map the spacetime
geometry of black holes. However, such mapping will require accurate models of
binary dynamics, which is a computational challenge whose difficulty is
significantly increased by resonance effects. We estimate that the resonance
phase shifts will be of order a few tens of cycles for mass ratios $\sim
10^{-6}$, by numerically evolving fully relativistic orbital dynamics
supplemented with an approximate, post-Newtonian self-force.

L_X>10^42erg/s at z~0.03-0.2, a region of parameter space which is currently
poorly constrained by deep narrow-field and high-energy (E>10keV) all-sky X-ray
surveys. We have used the widest XMM-Newton survey (the serendipitous source
catalogue) to select a representative sub-sample (14; ~10%) of the 147 X-ray
undetected candidate CT AGNs in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) with
f_X/f_[OIII]<1; the 147 sources account for ~50% of the overall Type-2 AGN
population in the SDSS-XMM overlap region. We use mid-IR spectral decomposition
analyses and emission-line diagnostics, determined from pointed Spitzer-IRS
spectroscopic observations of these candidate CT AGNs, to estimate the
intrinsic AGN emission (predicted L_X,2-10keV (0.2-30)x10^42erg/s). On the
basis of the optical [OIII], mid-IR [OIV] and 6um AGN continuum luminosities we
conservatively find that the X-ray emission in at least 6/14 (>43%) of our
sample appear to be obscured by CT material with N_H>1.5x10^24cm^-2. Under the
reasonable assumption that our 14 AGNs are representative of the overall X-ray
undetected AGN population in the SDSS-XMM parent sample, we find that >20% of
the optical Type-2 AGN population are likely to be obscured by CT material.
This implies a space-density of log(Phi) >-4.9Mpc^-3 for CT AGNs with
L_X>10^42erg/s at z~0.1, which we suggest may be consistent with that predicted
by X-ray background synthesis models. Furthermore, using the 6um continuum
luminosity to infer the intrinsic AGN luminosity and the stellar velocity
dispersion to estimate M_BH, we find that the most conservatively identified CT
AGNs in this sample may harbour some of the most rapidly growing black holes
(median M_BH~3x10^7M_o) in the nearby Universe, with a median Eddington ratio
of ~0.2.

accrete up to the median T Tauri rate. Multiple planets inside the hole can
torque the gas to high radial speeds over large distances, reducing the local
surface density while maintaining accretion. Thus multi-planet systems,
together with reductions in disk opacity due to grain growth, can explain how
holes can be simultaneously transparent and accreting. There remains the
problem of how outer disk gas diffuses into the hole. Here it has been proposed
that the magnetorotational instability (MRI) erodes disk surface layers ionized
by stellar X-rays. In contrast to previous work, we find that the extent to
which surface layers are MRI-active is limited not by ohmic dissipation but by
ambipolar diffusion, the latter measured by Am: the number of times a neutral
hydrogen molecule collides with ions in a dynamical time. Simulations by Hawley
& Stone showed that Am ~ 100 is necessary for ions to drive MRI turbulence in
neutral gas. We calculate that in X-ray-irradiated surface layers, Am typically
varies from ~0.001 to 1, depending on the abundance of charge-adsorbing
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, whose properties we infer from Spitzer
observations. We conclude that ionization of H_2 by X-rays and cosmic rays can
sustain, at most, only weak MRI turbulence in surface layers 1 to 10 g/cm^2
thick, and that accretion rates in such layers are too small compared to
observed accretion rates for the majority of disks.

dwarf -- neutron stars (WDNSs) in full general relativity. Our study serves as
a prelude to our analysis of the circular binary WDNS problem. We focus on
compact binaries whose total mass exceeds the maximum mass that a cold
degenerate star can support, and our goal is to determine the fate of such
systems. A fully general relativistic hydrodynamic computation of a realistic
WDNS head-on collision is prohibitive due to the large range of dynamical time
scales and length scales involved. For this reason, we construct an equation of
state (EOS) which captures the main physical features of NSs while, at the same
time, scales down the size of WDs. We call these scaled-down WD models
""pseudo-WDs (pWDs)"". Using pWDs, we can study these systems via a sequence of
simulations where the size of the pWD gradually increases toward the realistic
case. We perform two sets of simulations; One set studies the effects of the NS
mass on the final outcome, when the pWD is kept fixed. The other set studies
the effect of the pWD compaction on the final outcome, when the pWD mass and
the NS are kept fixed. All simulations show that 14%-18% of the initial total
rest mass escapes to infinity. All remnant masses still exceed the maximum rest
mass that our cold EOS can support (1.92 solar masses), but no case leads to
prompt collapse to a black hole. This outcome arises because the final
configurations are hot. All cases settle into spherical, quasiequilibrium
configurations consisting of a cold NS core surrounded by a hot mantle,
resembling Thorne-Zytkow objects. Extrapolating our results to realistic WD
compactions, we predict that the likely outcome of a head-on collision of a
realistic, massive WDNS system will be the formation of a quasiequilibrium
Thorne-Zytkow-like object.

the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We measure the color of main sequence
turn-off stars by finding the ""blue tip"" of the stellar locus: the prominent
blue edge in the distribution of stellar colors. The method is sensitive to
color changes of order 18, 12, 7, and 8 mmag of reddening in the colors u-g,
g-r, r-i, and i-z, respectively, in regions measuring 90' by 14'. We present
maps of the blue tip colors in each of these bands over the entire SDSS
footprint, including the new dusty southern Galactic cap data provided by the
SDSS-III. The results disfavor the best fit O'Donnell (1994) and Cardelli et
al. (1989) reddening laws, but are well described by a Fitzpatrick (1999)
reddening law with R_V = 3.1. The SFD dust map is found to trace the dust well,
but overestimates reddening by factors of 1.4, 1.0, 1.2, and 1.4 in u-g, g-r,
r-i, and i-z, largely due to the adopted reddening law. In select dusty regions
of the sky, we find evidence for problems in the SFD temperature correction. A
dust map normalization difference of 15% between the Galactic north and south
sky may be due to these dust temperature errors.

detect satellites/companions, diffuse emission and velocity shear, all with

dispersion along the line of sight(- 70 km s-1), much higher than standard
star-forming spirals in the low-redshift universe. We artificially redshift our
data to z - 2.2 to allow for a direct comparison with observations of high-z
LBGs and find striking similarities between both samples. This suggests that
either similar physical processes are responsible for their observed
properties, or, alternatively, that it is very difficult to distinguish between
different mechanisms operating in the low versus high redshift starburst
galaxies based on the available data. The comparison between morphologies in
the UV/optical continuum and our kinemetry analysis often shows that neither is
by itself sufficient to confirm or completely rule out the contribution from
recent merger events. We find a correlation between the kinematic properties
and stellar mass, in that more massive galaxies show stronger evidence for a
disk-like structure. This suggests a co-evolutionary process between the
stellar mass build-up and the formation of morphological and dynamical
sub-structure within the galaxy.

These modes both have two vector particles in the final state and thus angular
analyses must be used to disentangle the contributions from CP+ and CP-
configurations. The angular distributions, however, could be distorted by the
presence of S-waves masquerading as low mass K+K- pairs, that could result in
erroneous values of beta_s. The S-waves could well be the result of a final

may influence the co-evolution of SMBHs and their host galaxies. We examine
this possibility using SPH/N-body simulations of gaseous galaxy mergers in
which the merged BH receives a recoil kick. This enables us to follow recoiling
BHs in self-consistent, evolving merger remnants. In contrast to recent studies
on similar topics, we conduct a large parameter study, generating a suite of
over 200 simulations with more than 60 merger models and a range of recoil
velocities (vk). Our main results are as follows. (1) BHs kicked at nearly the
central escape speed (vesc) may oscillate on large orbits for up to a Hubble
time, but in gas-rich mergers, BHs kicked with up to ~ 0.7 vesc may be confined
to the central few kpc of the galaxy, owing to gas drag and steep central
potentials. (2) vesc in gas-rich mergers may increase rapidly during final
coalescence, in which case trajectories may depend on the timing of the BH
merger relative to the formation of the potential well. (3) Recoil events
generally reduce the lifetimes of bright active galactic nuclei (AGN), but may
actually extend AGN lifetimes at lower luminosities. (4) Kinematically-offset
AGN (v > 800 km s^-1) may be observable for up to ~ 10 Myr either immediately
after the recoil or during pericentric passages through a gas-rich remnant. (5)
Spatially-offset AGN (R > 1 kpc) generally have low luminosities and lifetimes
of ~ 1 - 100 Myr. (6) Rapidly-recoiling BHs may be up to ~ 5 times less massive
than their stationary counterparts. This lowers the normalization of the
M-sigma relation and contributes to both intrinsic and overall scatter. (7)
Finally, the displacement of AGN feedback after a recoil event enhances central
star formation rates, thereby extending the starburst phase of the merger and
creating a denser stellar cusp. [Abridged.]

constructing kinematic wave solutions to its Riemann problem with jump initial
conditions. In supply-demand space, the solutions on a link consist of an
interior state and a stationary state, subject to admissible conditions such

entropy conditions consistent with various discrete diverge models. In the
proposed analytical framework, kinematic waves on each link can be uniquely
determined by the stationary and initial conditions, and we prove that the
stationary states and boundary fluxes exist and are unique for the Riemann
problem of diverge models when all or partial of vehicles have predefined
routes. We show that the two diverge models by Lebacque and Daganzo are

metal--poor stars ([Fe/H]<-0.5 dex) in different evolutionary stages, based on
Vsini values from the literature. Our sample is comprised of stars in the field
and some Galactic globular clusters, including stars on the main sequence, the
red giant branch (RGB), and the horizontal branch (HB). The metal--poor stars
are, mainly, slow rotators, and their Vsini distribution along the HR diagram
is quite homogeneous. Nevertheless, a few moderate to high values of Vsini are
found in stars located on the main sequence and on the HB. We show that the
overall distribution of Vsini values is basically independent of metallicity
for the stars in our sample. In particular, the fast-rotating main sequence
stars in our sample present similar rotation rates as their metal-rich
counterparts, suggesting that some of them may actually be fairly young, in
spite of their low metallicity, or else that at least some of them would be
better classified as blue straggler stars. We do not find significant evidence
of evolution in Vsini values as a function of position on the RGB; in
particular, we do not confirm previous suggestions that stars close to the RGB
tip rotate faster than their less evolved counterparts. While the presence of
fast rotators among moderately cool blue HB stars has been suggested to be due
to angular momentum transport from a stellar core that has retained significant
angular momentum during its prior evolution, we find that any such transport
mechanisms must likely operate very fast as the star arrives on the zero-age HB
(ZAHB), since we do not find a link between evolution off the ZAHB and Vsini
values.

Added information to be more clear",,,,"hep-th gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the self-compactification of extra dimensions via higher curvature
gravity, f(R), where f(R) is the generic function of the Ricci scalar R. First,
we reduce pure f(R) theory to a scalar-tensor theory by a conformal
transformation. Then we show that, by a second conformal transformation, this
scalar-tensor theory turns out to a nonminimal scalar-tensor theory. We find
non-vanishing scalar field configurations that satisfy the conditions on the
partially vanishing energy-momentum tensor and the equations of motion of the
nonminimal scalar-tensor theory. It is interesting that we find that the source
of gravity has discrete spectrum. The minimum of the potential changes
according to the value of the coupling constant of the scalar field to the
curvature scalar. When the minimum is at zero for a vanishing scalar field, the
entire spacetime is flat. When the minimum is at a nonzero value for a
non-vanishing scalar field, the extra space is compactified. We thus show that
a given f(R) theory can self-compactify the extra dimensions.

protoplanetary disk with an embedded protoplanet using two-dimensional local
shearing-sheet model. Spiral density wave launched by the planet shocks and the
angular momentum carried by the wave is transferred to the background flow. The
exchange of the angular momentum can affect the mass flux in the vicinity of
the planet to form an underdense region, or gap, around the planetary orbit. We
first perform weakly non-linear analyses to show that the specific vorticity
formed by shock dissipation of density wave can be a source of mass flux in the
vicinity of the planet, and that the gap can be opened even for low-mass
planets unless the migration of the planet is substantial. We then perform high
resolution numerical simulations to check analytic consideration. By comparing
the gap opening timescale and type I migration timescale, we propose a
criterion for the formation of underdense region around the planetary orbit
that is qualitatively different from previous studies. The minimum mass
required for the planet to form a dip is twice as small as previous studies if
we incorporate the standard values of type I migration timescale, but it can be
much smaller if there is a location in the disk where type I migration is
halted.

leads to the Lipschitz condition under which the fraction measure of the

and multiple access techniques for channels with a nonflat frequency response,
as it saves the need for complex equalizers. It can offer high quality
performance in terms of bandwidth efficiency, robustness against multipath
fading and cost-effective implementation. However, its main disadvantage is the
high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of the output signal. As a result, a
linear behavior of the system over a large dynamic range is needed and
therefore the efficiency of the output amplifier is reduced. In this paper, we
investigate the effect of some of these sets of time waveforms on the OFDM
system performance in terms of Bit Error Rate (BER). We evaluate the system
performance in AWGN channels. The obtained results indicate that the reduction
in PAPR of the investigated methods is associated with considerable improvement
in BER performance of the system, in multipath channels, as compared to
conventional OFDM. These promising results indicate that pulse shaping with
reduced PAPR is an attractive solution for an OFDM system.

design. At the same time, we want high spatial resolution for accurate
three-dimensional designs to avoid postprocessing or interpretation as much as

balance these two requirements. We discuss requirements on AMR for topology

design problems demonstrate (1) that our AMR strategy for topology optimization
leads to designs that are equivalent to optimal designs on uniform meshes, (2)
how AMR strategies that do not satisfy the postulated requirements may lead to

suggesting a lossless memory requirement compression method for text data
compression. The proposed compression method will compress the text segment or
the text file based on two level approaches firstly reduction and secondly
compression. Reduction will be done using a word lookup table not using

lookup table, a binary file containing the addresses will be generated. Since
the proposed method does not use any compression algorithm in the first level

Although being a very flexible approach to programming industrial robots, a

  In order to understand whether #{\sc A-trails} in 4-regular maps can
AP-reduce to #{\sc ET} in 4-regular graphs, we investigate a problem in which
transitions in vertices are weighted (this generalizes both #{\sc A-trails} and
#{\sc ET}). In the 4-regular case we show that {\sc A-trails} can be used to
simulate any vertex weights and provide evidence that {\sc ET} can simulate
only a limited set of vertex weights.

adsorbed masses, down to the atomic level and beyond. Here I establish the
fundamental lower bound on the mass that can be measured with a nano-mechanical
oscillator in a given quantum state based on the quantum Cram\'er--Rao bound,
limited only by the laws of quantum mechanics, and identify the quantum states
which will allow the largest sensitivity for a given maximum energy.

  Concentrated on Stationary Points","7 pages, preprint",,,,"math.DS math.PR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Assume that a stochastic processes can be approximated, when some scale
parameter gets large, by a fluid limit (also called ""mean field limit"", or
""hydrodynamic limit""). A common practice, often called the ""fixed point
approximation"" consists in approximating the stationary behaviour of the
stochastic process by the stationary points of the fluid limit. It is known
that this may be incorrect in general, as the stationary behaviour of the fluid
limit may not be described by its stationary points. We show however that, if
the stochastic process is reversible, the fixed point approximation is indeed
valid. More precisely, we assume that the stochastic process converges to the
fluid limit in distribution (hence in probability) at every fixed point in
time. This assumption is very weak and holds for a large family of processes,
among which many mean field and other interaction models. We show that the
reversibility of the stochastic process implies that any limit point of its
stationary distribution is concentrated on stationary points of the fluid
limit. If the fluid limit has a unique stationary point, it is an approximation
of the stationary distribution of the stochastic process.

new WF evolution formula of any initial state in self-Kerr Medium with photon

independent of the coupling factor with Kerr Medium, where the number state is
not affected by the Kerr nonlinearity and evolves into a density operator of
binomial distribution.
