respectively, of which 205, 123, 14, 126, and 109 objects do not have
previously published photometry. Photometry is performed using archival images
from the Local Group Galaxies Survey, which covers 2.2 deg^2 along the major
axis of M31. We focus on 445 confirmed `globular-like' clusters and candidates,
comprising typical globular and young massive clusters. The ages and masses of
these objects are derived by comparison of their observed spectral-energy
distributions with simple stellar population synthesis. Approximately half of
the clusters are younger than 2 Gyr, suggesting that there has been significant
recent active star formation in M31, which is consistent with previous results.
We note that clusters in the halo (r_ projected>30kpc) are composed of two
different components, older clusters with ages >10 Gyr and younger clusters
with ages around 1 Gyr. The spatial distributions show that the young clusters
(<2 Gyr) are spatially coincident with the galaxy's disk, including the `10 kpc
ring,' the `outer ring,' and the halo of M31, while the old clusters (> 2 Gyr)
are spatially correlated with the bulge and halo. We also estimate the masses
of the 445 confirmed clusters and candidates in M31 and find that our estimates
agree well with previously published values. We find that none of the young
disk clusters can survive the inevitable encounters with giant molecular clouds
in the galaxy's disk and that they will eventually disrupt on timescales of a
few Gyr. Specifically, young disk clusters with a mass of 10^4 M_\odot are
expected to dissolve within 3.0 Gyr and will, thus, not evolve to become
globular clusters.

with 95% confidence that the mass of the muon neutrino differs from that of its
antineutrino partner, which contradicts the entrenched relativistic quantum
theory notion that a free antiparticle is a negative-energy free particle
compelled to travel backwards in time. Also a discrepancy of about five
standard deviations in the value of the proton charge radius recently obtained
from muonic hydrogen versus that previously obtained from electronic hydrogen
casts doubt on the calculation of the dominant relativistic QED contributions
to the effects that are actually measured (e.g., the Lamb shift): these QED
contributions dominate proton charge radius contributions less in muonic
hydrogen than in electronic hydrogen. The negative-energy ""free particles"" of
entrenched relativistic quantum theory are well-known features of the
Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations, which are shown to have many other unphysical
features as well. The correspondence principle for relativistic particles is
incompatible with these two equations, produces no unphysical features and
implies only positive energies for free particles, which eliminates the very
basis of the entrenched notion of antiparticles, as well as of the CPT theorem.
This principle thus requires antiparticles to arise from charge conjugation (or
more generally CP) invariance, whose known breaking is naturally expected to
produce mass splitting between particle and antiparticle, in consonance with
the preliminary MINOS data. It also requires revamping of relativistic QED,
which is in accord with the doubt cast on it by the proton charge radius
results, and implies that QED is nonlocal, i.e. has no Hamiltonian density.

demonstrated the importance of learning algorithms for deep architectures,
i.e., function classes obtained by composing multiple non-linear

examples from other distributions) has already been applied to deep learners,
but mostly to show the advantage of unlabeled examples. Here we explore the
advantage brought by {\em out-of-distribution examples}. For this purpose we
developed a powerful generator of stochastic variations and noise processes for
character images, including not only affine transformations but also slant,
local elastic deformations, changes in thickness, background images, grey level
changes, contrast, occlusion, and various types of noise. The
out-of-distribution examples are obtained from these highly distorted images or
by including examples of object classes different from those in the target test
set. We show that {\em deep learners benefit more from out-of-distribution
examples than a corresponding shallow learner}, at least in the area of
handwritten character recognition. In fact, we show that they beat previously
published results and reach human-level performance on both handwritten digit
classification and 62-class handwritten character recognition.

approximate well, and so unlikely to be efficiently solvable in the worst case.
Recently, Bilu and Linial \cite{Bilu09} suggested an approach aimed at
bypassing this computational barrier by using properties of instances one might
hope to hold in practice. In particular, they argue that instances in practice
should be stable to small perturbations in the metric space and give an
efficient algorithm for clustering instances of the Max-Cut problem that are
stable to perturbations of size $O(n^{1/2})$. In addition, they conjecture that
instances stable to as little as O(1) perturbations should be solvable in
polynomial time. In this paper we prove that this conjecture is true for any
center-based clustering objective (such as $k$-median, $k$-means, and
$k$-center). Specifically, we show we can efficiently find the optimal
clustering assuming only stability to factor-3 perturbations of the underlying
metric in spaces without Steiner points, and stability to factor $2+\sqrt{3}$
perturbations for general metrics. In particular, we show for such instances
that the popular Single-Linkage algorithm combined with dynamic programming
will find the optimal clustering. We also present NP-hardness results under a
weaker but related condition.

the clustering hyperplanes for both the classes and use their angle bisectors

idea leads to small decision trees and better performance. We also present some

constitutive model is used to express the fluid dynamic viscosity in terms of
the velocity gradient. Transient start-up characteristics of electro-osmotic
power-law liquid flow in rectangular microchannels are simulated by using
finite element method. Under a DC electric field, it is found out and the fluid
is more inert to the external electric field and the steady-state velocity
profile becomes more plug-like with decrease of the flow behavior index of the
power-law liquids. The numerical calculations also confirm the validity of the
generalized Smoluchowski slip velocity which can serve as the counterpart for
the classic Smoluchowski slip velocity when dealing with electrokinetic flow of
non-Newtonian power-law fluids. Under AC electric fields, the fluid is more
obviously accelerated during oscillations and the amplitude of the oscillating
velocity is closer to the magnitude of the generalized Smoluchowski velocity as
the fluid behavior index increases. These dynamic predictions are of practical
significance for the design of microfluidic devices that manipulate
non-Newtonian fluids such as biofluids, polymer solutions and colloidal
suspensions.

\texttt{AdaBoost}, where the central point lies in the recognition that
\textit{margin} is the key for characterizing the performance of
\texttt{AdaBoost}. This theory has been very influential, e.g., it has been
used to argue that \texttt{AdaBoost} usually does not overfit since it tends to
enlarge the margin even after the training error reaches zero. Previously the
\textit{minimum margin bound} was established for \texttt{AdaBoost}, however,
\cite{Breiman1999} pointed out that maximizing the minimum margin does not
necessarily lead to a better generalization. Later, \cite{Reyzin:Schapire2006}
emphasized that the margin distribution rather than minimum margin is crucial
to the performance of \texttt{AdaBoost}. In this paper, we first present the
\textit{$k$th margin bound} and further study on its relationship to previous
work such as the minimum margin bound and Emargin bound. Then, we improve the
previous empirical Bernstein bounds
\citep{Maurer:Pontil2009,Audibert:Munos:Szepesvari2009}, and based on such
findings, we defend the margin-based explanation against Breiman's doubts by
proving a new generalization error bound that considers exactly the same
factors as \cite{Schapire:Freund:Bartlett:Lee1998} but is sharper than
\cite{Breiman1999}'s minimum margin bound. By incorporating factors such as
average margin and variance, we present a generalization error bound that is
heavily related to the whole margin distribution. We also provide margin
distribution bounds for generalization error of voting classifiers in finite
VC-dimension space.

specific scenario of the oscillation mechanism in black hole accretion disc,
that modeling such correlated trends puts very strong constraints on the nature
of this oscillation and the characteristic features of the hot flow in Active
Galactic Nuclei (AGN). In our model, QPO oscillations are due to the
oscillations of the shock formed in the low angular momentum hot accretion
flow, and the variation of the shock location corresponds to the observed
changes in the QPO period and the X-ray flux. In this scenario, change in the
shock location caused by perturbation of the flow angular momentum is
compatible with the trends observed in RE J1034+396, whereas the perturbation
of the specific flow energy results in too strong flux response to the change
of the oscillation period. Using a complete general relativistic framework to
study the accretion flow in the Kerr metric, we discuss the role of the black
hole spin in the period drift. Future missions are expected to bring more
active galaxies with time-resolved quasi-periodic oscillations so similar

reactions of particles in spiny dendrites. As a starting point we use two-state
Markovian model with the transition probabilities depending on residence time

spine, the smaller becomes the transition probability from spine to dendrite.
We extend a linear model presented in [PRL, \textbf{101}, 218102 (2008)] and
derive the nonlinear Master equations for the average densities of particles
inside spines and parent dendrite by eliminating residence time variable. We
show that the flux of particles between spines and parent dendrite is not local
in time and space. In particular the average flux of particles from a
population of spines through spines necks into parent dendrite depends on
chemical reactions in spines. This memory effect means that one can not
separate the exchange flux of particles and the chemical reactions inside
spines. This phenomenon does not exist in the Markovian case. The flux of
particles from dendrite to spines is found to depend on the transport process
inside dendrite. We show that if the particles inside a dendrite have constant
velocity, the mean particle's position $<x(t)> $ increases as $t^{\mu}$ with
$\mu <1$ (anomalous convection). We derive a fractional convection-diffusion
equation for the total density of particles.

  In order to quantify the functional connectivity for the glycolytic enzymes
in dissipative conditions we have analyzed different catalytic patterns using
the non-linear statistical tool of Transfer Entropy. The data were obtained by
means of a yeast glycolytic model formed by three delay differential equations
where the enzymatic speed functions of the irreversible stages have been
explicitly considered. These enzymatic activity functions were previously
modeled and tested experimentally by other different groups. In agreement with
experimental conditions, the studied time series corresponded to a
quasi-periodic route to chaos. The results of the analysis are three-fold:
first, in addition to the classical topological structure characterized by the
specific location of enzymes, substrates, products and feedback regulatory
metabolites, an effective functional structure emerges in the modeled
glycolytic system, which is dynamical and characterized by notable variations
of the functional interactions. Second, the dynamical structure exhibits a
metabolic invariant which constrains the functional attributes of the enzymes.
Finally, in accordance with the classical biochemical studies, our numerical
analysis reveals in a quantitative manner that the enzyme phosphofructokinase
is the key-core of the metabolic system, behaving for all conditions as the

computations of polydispersed turbulent two-phase flows, using a mean-field/PDF
approach. In this approach, the numerical solution is obtained by resorting to
a hybrid method where the mean fluid properties are computed by solving
mean-field (RANS) equations with a classical finite volume procedure whereas
the local instantaneous properties of the particles are determined by solving
stochastic differential equations (SDEs). The fundamentals of the general
formalism are recalled and particular attention is focused on a specific
theoretical issue: the treatment of the multiscale character of the dynamics of
the discrete particles, that is the consistency of the system of SDEs in
asymptotic cases. Then, the main lines of the particle/mesh algorithm are given
and some specific problems, related to the integration of the SDEs, are
discussed, for example, issues related to the specificity of the treatment of
the averaging and projection operators, the time integration of the SDEs (weak
numerical schemes consistent with all asymptotic cases), and the computation of
the source terms. Practical simulations, for three different flows, are
performed in order to demonstrate the ability of both the models and the
numerics to cope with the stringent specificities of polydispersed turbulent
two-phase flows.

Multidimensional cosmological solutions with m 2-form fields and l scalar

singled out and discussed. Each of solutions contain two factor spaces:
one-dimensional space M_1 and Ricci-flat space M_2. A 3-dimensional subspace of
M_2 is interpreted as ""our"" space. We show that there exists a time interval
where accelerated expansion of our 3D space is compatible with a small enough
variation of the effective gravitational constant G(\tau). This interval
contains \tau_0 which is the point of minimum of G(\tau) (here \tau is the
synchronous time variable). Special solutions with three phantom scalar fields
are analyzed. It is shown that in the vicinity of the point \tau_0 the time
variation of G(\tau) decreases in the sequence of Lie algebras A_3, C_3 and B_3
when the solutions with asymptotically power-law behavior of scale-factors for
\tau \to \infty are considered. Exact solutions with asymptotically exponential

area its small constituents or units are much more common than the large ones.
This paper develops a novel perspective to the scaling of geographic space
using large street networks involving both cities and countryside. Given a
street network of an entire country, we decompose the street network into
individual blocks, each of which forms a minimum ring or cycle such as city
blocks and field blocks. The block sizes demonstrate the scaling property,
i.e., far more small blocks than large ones. Interestingly, we find that the
mean of all the block sizes can easily separate between small and large blocks-
a high percentage (e.g., 90%) of smaller ones and a low percentage (e.g., 10%)
of larger ones. Based on this regularity, termed as the head/tail division
rule, we propose an approach to delineating city boundaries by grouping the
smaller blocks. The extracted city sizes for the three largest European
countries (France, Germany and UK) exhibit power law distributions. We further
define the concept of border number as a topological distance of a block far
from the outmost border to map the center(s) of the country and the city. We
draw an analogy between a country and a city (or geographic space in general)
with a complex organism like the human body or the human brain to further
elaborate on the power of this block perspective in reflecting the structure or
patterns of geographic space.

scaling can also be applied to contributions to volatility of the assets in the
portfolio. Close prices are often used to calculate the profit and loss of a
portfolio. Trading at exchanges located in distant time zones this can lead to
significant serial cross-correlations of the closing-time returns of the assets
in the portfolio. These serial correlations cause the square-root-of-time rule
to fail. Moreover volatility contributions in this setting turn out to be
misleading due to non-synchronous correlations. We address this issue and
provide alternative procedures for scaling volatility and calculating risk

high band gap absorber material in all-Si tandem solar cell devices. Due to the
large potential barriers for photoexited charge carriers, transport in these
devices is restricted to quantum confined superlattice states. As a consequence
of the finite number of wells, large built-in fields and any kind of disorder,
the electronic spectrum can deviate considerably from the minibands of a

non-equilibrium Green's function formalism for an effective mass Hamiltonian is
used to investigate photogeneration and transport in such devices for arbitrary

both photons and phonons, the theory is able to provide a microscopic picture
