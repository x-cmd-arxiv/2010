the Fermi LAT sample, constraining the birth properties, beaming and evolution
of these spin-powered objects. Using quantitative tests of agreement with the
distributions of observed spin and pulse properties, we find that short birth
periods P_0 ~ 50ms and gamma-ray beams arising in the outer magnetosphere,
dominated by a single pole, are strongly preferred. The modeled relative
numbers of radio-detected and radio-quiet objects agree well with the data.
Although the sample is local, extrapolation to the full Galaxy implies a
gamma-ray pulsar birthrate 1/(59 yr). This is shown to be in good agreement
with the estimated Galactic core collapse rate and with the local density of OB
star progenitors. We give predictions for the numbers of expected young pulsar
detections if Fermi LAT observations continue 10 years. In contrast to the
potentially significant contribution of unresolved millisecond pulsars, we find
that young pulsars should contribute little to the Galactic gamma-ray
background.

Be star with a highly eccentric orbit (e=0.87) with a period of 3.4 years. The
system exhibits variable, non-thermal radiation visible from radio to very high
energies (VHE) around periastron passage. This radiation is thought to
originate from particles accelerated in the shock region between the pulsar
wind (PW) and stellar outflows. The consistency of the H.E.S.S. data with the
inverse Compton (IC) scenario is studied in the context of dominant orbital
phase dependent adiabatic losses. The dependence of the observed TeV flux with
the separation distance is analyzed. Model calculations based on IC scattering
of shock accelerated PW electrons and UV photons are performed. Different
non-radiative cooling profiles are suggested for the primary particle
population to account for the variable TeV flux. The TeV fluxes obtained with
H.E.S.S. in the years 2004 and 2007 seem to be only dependent on the binary
separation. The presented results hint at a peculiar non-radiative cooling
profile around periastron dominating the VHE emission in PSR B1259-63. The
location of the stellar disc derived from this non-radiative cooling profile is
in good agreement with that inferred from radio observations.

the Klein-Gordon problem on a space with variable geometry into solution of a
one-dimensional stationary Schr\""odinger-type equation with potential generated
by this variation is useful. We draw the following conclusions: (1) The signal
related to the degree of freedom specific to the higher-dimensional part does
not penetrate into the smaller-dimensional part because of an inertial force
inevitably arising in the transition region (this is the centrifugal force in
our models). (2) The specific spectrum of scalar excitations resembles the

theories of gravity is addressed. This is a key point in order to complete the
proper definition of these theories and, what is very important, to study their
possible phenomenological implications. As is well known, in
Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity the breakdown of Lorentz invariance invalidates the
usual notion of minimally coupled matter. Two different approaches to bypass
this problem are here described. One is based on a Kaluza-Klein
reinterpretation of the 3+1 decomposition of the gravity degrees of freedom,
what naturally leads to a definition of a U(1) gauge symmetry and, hence, to a
new type of minimal coupling. The other approach relies on a midi-superspace
formalism and the subsequent parametrization of the matter stress-energy tensor
in terms of deep infrared variables. Using the last option, the phase space of
the Horava-Lifshitz cosmology in the presence of general matter couplings is
studied. It is found, in particular, that the equation of state of the
effective matter may be very different from the actual matter one, owing to the
non-linear interactions which exists between matter and gravity.

on ""partially suspended"" states, where the hairs bend to support the drop --
singlet states where all hairs bend in the same direction, and doublet states
where neighbouring hairs bend in opposite directions -- and find the limits of
stability of these configurations in terms of material contact angle, hair
flexibility, and system geometry. The drop can remain suspended in a singlet
state at hydrophilic contact angles, but doublets exist only when the hairs are
hydrophobic. The system is more likely to evolve into a singlet state if the
hairs are inclined at the root. We discuss how, under limited circumstances,

dramatic quantum optics effects. We consider a one-dimensional continuum of
bosons coupled to a single localized TLS, a system which may be realized in a
variety of plasmonic, photonic, or electronic contexts. We present the exact
many-body scattering eigenstate obtained by imposing open boundary conditions.
Multi-photon bound states appear in the scattering of two or more photons due
to the coupling between the photons and the TLS. Such bound states are shown to
have a large effect on scattering of both Fock and coherent state wavepackets,
especially in the intermediate coupling strength regime. We compare the
statistics of the transmitted light with a coherent state having the same mean
photon number: as the interaction strength increases, the one-photon
probability is suppressed rapidly, and the two- and three-photon probabilities
are greatly enhanced due to the many-body bound states. This results in
non-Poissonian light.

corrections to graphene DOS dependent on type and concentration of defects. In

that a relatively small concentration of defects may lead to significant and
specific changes in the DOS, especially at low frequencies, near the Van Hove

defects generate one or several narrow gaps near the critical points of the

All types of defects are characterized by the appearance of one or more
additional Van Hove peaks near the (Dirac) K points and their singular

Besides, for low frequencies and near the critical points the relative change

efforts in order to classify their observed behaviors in a few states. The
progress made in the understanding of the Quasi-Periodic Oscillations observed
in these objects now makes it possible to develop a new way to find order in
their behavior, based on the theorized physical processes associated with these
oscillations. This will also have the interest of reuniting microquasars in a
single classification based on the physical processes at work and therefore
independent of their specificities (mass, variation timescale, outburst
history, etc.). This classification is aimed to be a tool to further our
understanding of microquasars behavior and not to replace phenomenological
states. We start by considering three instabilities that can cause accretion in
the disk. We compare the conditions for their development, and the
Quasi-Periodic Oscillations they can be expected to produce, with the spectral
states in which these Quasi-Periodic Oscillations are observed and sometimes
coexist. From the three instabilities that we proposed to explain the three
states of GRS 1915+105 we actually found the theoretical existence of four
states. We compared those four states with observations and also how those four
states can be seen in a model-independent fashion. Those four state can be used
to find an order in microquasar observations, based on the properties of the
Quasi-Periodic Oscillations and the physics of the associated instabilities.

that the class of partial order languages representable by saturated slice

languages belonging to this class can be tested for inclusion and admit
canonical representatives in terms of Hasse diagram generators. As an

qubit. However, universal control of the qubit requires arbitrary rotations
around at least two axes. Here we show that by subjecting each electron spin to

widespread mobile phones used by nearly all people. This system provides
user-friendly, PC-based tools for creating a tree index of pages and inserting
multiple multimedia contents (e.g. sound, video and picture) in each page for
creating a J2ME mobile application. The output is a stand-alone Java mobile
application that has a user interface, shows texts and pictures and plays music
and videos regardless of the type of devices used as long as the devices
support the J2ME platform. Bitmap fonts have also been used thus Middle Eastern
languages can be easily supported on all mobile phone devices. We omitted
programming concepts for users in order to simplify multimedia content-oriented
mobile application designing for use in educational, cultural or marketing
centers. Ordinary operators can now create a variety of multimedia mobile
applications such as tutorials, catalogues, books, and guides in minutes rather
than months. Simplicity and power has been the goal of this CMS. In this paper,
we present the software engineered-designed concepts of the ARMrayan MCMS along
with the implementation challenges faces and solutions adapted.

the initiation of activity in a neural culture. The cultures are modeled as
random graphs, whose nodes are excitatory neurons with kin inputs and kout
outputs, and whose input degrees kin = k obey given distribution functions pk.
We examine the firing activity of the population of neurons according to their
input degree (k) classes and calculate for each class its firing probability
\Phi_k(t) as a function of t. The probability of a node to fire is found to be
determined by its in-degree k, and the first-to-fire neurons are those that
have a high k. A small minority of high-k classes may be called ""Leaders"", as
they form an inter-connected subnetwork that consistently fires much before the
rest of the culture. Once initiated, the activity spreads from the Leaders to
the less connected majority of the culture. We then use the distribution of
in-degree of the Leaders to study the growth rate of the number of neurons
active in a burst, which was experimentally measured to be initially
exponential. We find that this kind of growth rate is best described by a
population that has an in-degree distribution that is a Gaussian centered
around k = 75 with width {\sigma} = 31 for the majority of the neurons, but
also has a power law tail with exponent -2 for ten percent of the population.
Neurons in the tail may have as many as k = 4, 700 inputs. We explore and
discuss the correspondence between the degree distribution and a dynamic
neuronal threshold, showing that from the functional point of view, structure
and elementary dynamics are interchangeable. We discuss possible geometric
origins of this distribution, and comment on the importance of size, or of
having a large number of neurons, in the culture.

amounts to solving a large-scale matrix factorization problem, which can be
done efficiently with classical optimization tools. The same approach has also
been used for learning features from data for other purposes, e.g., image

rigid respect for the historical context, an analysis is done of the derivation
of the universal mass-energy relationship. It is found, contrary to the today

Energy in the 1905 context. After emphasizing the difference between 1905
Relativity (1905R) and Special Relativity (SR), the developing of a 1905R
relativistic gravity is started for a small mass m material point moving in the
central gravitational field of a great mass M one. A formula for the rest mass
m_0 as a function of its distance r from M is obtained. Finally, those results
are applied to an atomic clock in a gravitational field, reaching a factor to
obtain the clock time rate change very close to the GR one. The factors from
1905R and GR are compared, emphasizing the absent of a singularity in 1905R. In
the conclusions, a new road for the development of a 1905R relativistic
mechanics is declared, related with the discovery that Rest Mass measures

short. (3) The shoulders on the rise to superoutburst have more structure than

energies related to aggregation equations with degenerate diffusion on
$\Real^d$. Such equations arise in mathematical biology as models for organism
group dynamics which account for competition between the tendency to aggregate
into groups and nonlinear diffusion to avoid over-crowding. The existence of
non-zero optimal free energy stationary solutions representing coherent groups
in $\Real^d$ is therefore of interest. The primary contribution is the
investigation of a notion of criticality associated with the global minimizer
problem. The notion arises from the scaling of diffusive and aggregative forces
as mass spreads and is shown to dictate the existence, and sometimes
non-existence, of global minimizers.

their explosive death. We present the discovery and follow-up observations of a
Type IIn SN, PTF 09uj, detected by the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF).
Serendipitous observations by GALEX at ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths detected
the rise of the SN light curve prior to the PTF discovery. The UV light curve
of the SN rose fast, with a time scale of a few days, to a UV absolute AB
magnitude of about -19.5. Modeling our observations, we suggest that the fast
rise of the UV light curve is due to the breakout of the SN shock through the
dense CSM (n~10^10 cm^-3). Furthermore, we find that prior to the explosion the
progenitor went through a phase of high mass-loss rate (~0.1 solar mass per
year) that lasted for a few years. The decay rate of this SN was fast relative
to that of other SNe IIn.

violent relaxation and the cluster-forming core mass is affected by the slope
and normalization of the core mass-radius relation. Assuming mass-independent
star formation efficiency and gas-expulsion time-scale
$\tau_{GExp}/\tau_{cross}$ and a given external tidal field, it is found that
constant surface density cores and constant radius cores have the potential to
lead to the preferential removal of high- and low-mass clusters, respectively.
In contrast, constant volume density cores result in mass-independent cluster
infant weight-loss, as suggested by observations. Our modelling includes
predictions about the evolution of high-mass cluster-forming cores, a regime
not yet covered by the observations. An overview of various issues directly
affected by the nature of the core mass-radius relation is presented (e.g.
cluster mass function, galaxy star formation histories, globular cluster
self-enrichment). Finally, we emphasize that observational mass-radius
data-sets of dense gas regions must be handled with caution as they may be the

light of possible new effects from substructure. There is strong tension
between getting a large enough lepton signal while respecting constraints on
the fluxes of associated gamma rays. We first show that these constraints
become significantly more stringent than in previous studies when the
contributions from background e^+ e^- are taken into account, so much so that
even cored DM density profiles are ruled out. We then show how DM annihilations
within subhalos can get around these constraints. Specifically, if most of the
observed lepton excess comes from annihilations in a nearby (within 1 kpc)
subhalo along a line of sight toward the galactic center, it is possible to
match both the lepton and gamma ray observations. We demonstrate that this can
be achieved in a simple class of particle physics models in which the DM
annihilates via a hidden leptophilic U(1) vector boson, with explicitly
computed Sommerfeld enhancement factors. Gamma ray constraints on the main halo
annihilations (and CMB constraints from the era of decoupling) require the
annihilating component of the DM to be subdominant, of order 10^-2 of the total

problem, we argue that in such systematic studies there may be no algorithm by
which one can determine all physical effects. We take large volume type IIB
compactifications as an example, with the physical property of interest being
the low-energy non-perturbative F-terms of a generic compactification. A
similar analysis is expected to hold for other kinds of string vacua, and we
discuss in particular the extension of our ideas to F-theory. While these
results imply that it may not be possible to answer systematically certain
physical questions about generic type IIB compactifications, we identify
particular Calabi-Yau manifolds in which the diophantine equations become
linear, and thus can be systematically solved. As part of the study of the
required systematics of F-terms, we develop technology for computing Z_2
equivariant line bundle cohomology on toric varieties, which determines the
presence of particular instanton zero modes via the Koszul complex. This is of
general interest for realistic IIB model building on complete intersections in

Science Demonstration Field and cross-matching these data with radio data from
the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-Centimetres (FIRST) survey and the
NRAO VLA Northern Sky Survey (NVSS), we obtain 104 radio counterparts to the
Herschel sources. With these data we find no evidence for evolution in the
far-infrared--radio correlation over the redshift range 0<z<0.5, where the
median value for the ratio between far-infrared and radio luminosity, $q_{\rm
IR}$, over this range is $q_{\rm IR} = 2.40\pm 0.12$ (and a mean of $q_{\rm
IR}=2.52 \pm 0.03$ accounting for the lower limits), consistent with both the
local value determined from {\em IRAS} and values derived from surveys
targeting the high-redshift Universe. By comparing the radio fluxes of our
sample measured from both FIRST and NVSS we show that previous results
suggesting an increase in the value of $q_{\rm IR}$ from high to low redshift
may be the result of resolving out extended emission of the low-redshift
sources with relatively high-resolution interferometric data, although AGN
contamination could still play a significant role.
  We also find tentative evidence that the longer wavelength, cooler dust is
heated by an evolved stellar population which does not trace the star-formation
rate as closely as the shorter wavelength $\ltsim 250~\mu$m emission or the
radio emission, supporting suggestions based on detailed models of individual
galaxies.

expected from an extragalactic pulse. We report here on the detection of 16
pulses, the bulk of which exhibit a frequency sweep with a shape and magnitude
resembling the Lorimer Burst. These new events were detected in a sidelobe of
the Parkes Telescope and are of clearly terrestrial origin, with properties
unlike any known sources of terrestrial broad-band radio emission. The new
detections cast doubt on the extragalactic interpretation of the original
burst, and call for further sophistication in radio-pulse survey techniques to
identify the origin of the anomalous terrestrial signals and definitively
distinguish future extragalactic pulse detections from local signals. The
ambiguous origin of these seemingly dispersed, swept-frequency signals suggest
that radio-pulse searches using multiple detectors will be the only experiments

based on the second law of thermodynamics (or principle of entropy increase).
An interesting link between macroscopically observable quantities of an
ensemble (state variables) and the thermal velocity of its individual
constituents such as molecules in a liquid is provided by the Brownian motion
of suspended larger particles. We postulate a ""frustrated Brownian motion"" that
occurs if these particles get partially trapped in an environment of suitable
geometrical conditions. This dissipates a small fraction of the kinetic energy
attended with the Brownian motion and deposits it inside the trap, and so this
constitutes a mechanism that by itself transfers thermal energy from cold to
warm. We note that this is just a marginally admitted, slowly evolving effect
driven by a thermodynamic quasi-equilibrium, thus being of limited efficiency
in terms of energy density attainable per unit of time. However, a simple
experiment suggests that this process indeed is allowed to take place, and the
envisaged applications then are straightforward.

cores in a high resolution simulation of a giant molecular cloud. The simulated
cloud contains 10^4 solar masses and produces over 350 cores which allows for
meaningful statistics. Cores are classified into three types according to how
much they depart from spherical symmetry. We find that three quarters of the
cores are better described as irregular filaments than as spheres. Recent
Herschel results have shown that cores are formed within a network of
filaments, which we find has had a significant impact on the resulting core
geometries. We show that the column densities and ram pressure seen by the
protostar are not uniform and generally peak along the axes of the filament.
The angular momentum vector of the material in the cores varies both in
magnitude and direction, which will cause the rotation vector of the central
source to fluctuate during the collapse of the core. In the case of the more
massive stars, accretion from the environment outside the original core volume
is even more important than that from the core itself. This additional gas is
primarily accreted onto the cores along the dense filaments in which the cores
are embedded, and the sections of the surfaces of the cores which do not
coincide with a filament have very little additional material passing through
them. The assumption of spherical symmetry cannot be applied to the majority of
collapsing cores, and is never a good description of how stars accrete gas from
outside the original core radius. This has ramifications for our understanding
of collapsing cores, in particular their line profiles, the effect of radiation
upon them and their ability to fragment.

binary stellar populations. The most common way to compute the change in
orbital period during a CE is to relate the binding energy of the envelope of
the Roche-lobe filling giant to the change in orbital energy. Especially in
population-synthesis codes, where the evolution of millions of stars must be
computed and detailed evolutionary models are too expensive computationally,
simple approximations are made for the envelope binding energy. In this study,
we present accurate analytic prescriptions based on detailed stellar-evolution
models that provide the envelope binding energy for giants with metallicities
between Z = 10-4 and Z = 0.03 and masses between 0.8 Msun and 100 Msun, as a
function of the metallicity, mass, radius and evolutionary phase of the star.
Our results are also presented in the form of electronic data tables and
Fortran routines that use them. We find that the accuracy of our fits is better
than 15% for 90% of our model data points in all cases, and better than 10% for
90% of our data points in all cases except the asymptotic giant branches for
three of the six metallicities we consider. For very massive stars (M > 50
Msun), when stars lose more than ~20% of their initial mass due to stellar
winds, our fits do not describe the models as accurately. Our results are more
widely applicable - covering wider ranges of metallicity and mass - and are of

belongs to one of 18 exceptional families. We prove that at least 12 of the 18
families are non-empty and study their algebraic structure. We also establish
that any radial eigencubic satisfies the trace identity $\det \mathrm{Hess}^3
(f)=\alpha f$ for the Hessian matrix of $f$, where $\alpha\in \R{}$. Another
result of the paper is a correspondence between radial eigencubics and
isoparametric hypersurfaces with four principal curvatures.

mass. We took spectra of its strongly irradiated companion and found an
observed radial-velocity amplitude of K_obs=324+/-3 km/s. Correcting this for
the fact that, due to the irradiation, the center of light lies inward relative

i=65+/-2 deg inferred from models of the lightcurve, our best-fit pulsar mass

probable samples of galaxies at z~8, selected by the so-called dropout method
or photometric redshift; e.g., Y_105-dropouts (Y_105-J_125 > 0.8). These
studies are highly useful for investigating both the early star formation
history of galaxies and the sources of cosmic re-ionization. In order to better
understand these issues, we carefully examine if there are low-$z$ interlopers
in the samples of z~8 galaxy candidates. We focus on the strong emission-line
galaxies at z~2 in this paper. Such galaxies may be selected as Y_105-dropouts
since the [OIII] lambda 5007 emission line is redshifted into the J_125-band.
We have found that the contamination from such low-$z$ interlopers is
negligibly small. Therefore, all objects found by the five groups are free from
this type of contamination. However, it remains difficult to extract real z~8
galaxies because all the sources are very faint and the different groups have
found different candidates. With this in mind, we construct a robust sample of
eight galaxies at z~8 from the objects found by the five groups: each of these
eight objects has been selected by at least two groups. Using this sample, we
discuss their UV continuum slope. We also discuss the escape fraction of
ionizing photons adopting various metallicities. Our analysis suggests that
massive stars forming in low-metallicity gas (Z~5 \times 10^-4 Z_sun) can be
responsible for the completion of cosmic re-ionization if the escape fraction
of ionizing continuum from galaxies is as large as 0.5, and this is consistent
with the observed blue UV continua.

redshifted 21-cm from the epoch of reionization (EoR) often assume that the
spin temperature is decoupled from the background CMB temperature and is much
larger than it. Although a valid assumption towards the latter stages of the
reionization process, it does not necessarily hold at the earlier epochs.
Violation of this assumption will lead to fluctuations in differential
brightness temperature that are neither driven by density fluctuations nor by
HII regions. Therefore, it is vital to calculate the spin temperature
self-consistently by treating the Lyman-alpha and collisional coupling of spin
temperature to the kinetic temperature. In this paper we develop an extension
to the BEARS algorithm, originally developed to model reionization history, to
include these coupling effects. Here we simulate the effect in ionization and
heating for three models in which the reionization is driven by stars, miniqsos
or a mixture of both.We also perform a number of statistical tests to quantify
the imprint of the self-consistent inclusion of the spin temperature decoupling
from the CMB. We find that the evolution of the spin temperature has an impact
on the measured signal specially at redshifts higher than 10 and such evolution
should be taken into account when one attempts to interpret the observational
data.

search of clues that can lead to a more fundamental understanding. One way to
view this characterization is the improved determination of the
redshift-dependence of the dark energy equation of state parameter, w(z). To do
this requires a robust and bias-free method for reconstructing w(z) from data
that does not rely on restrictive expansion schemes or assumed functional forms
for w(z). We present a new nonparametric reconstruction method that solves for
w(z) as a statistical inverse problem, based on a Gaussian Process

provides controlled error bounds. We demonstrate the power of the method on

basic findings reported in Kato et al. (2009): the presence of stages A-C, as
well as the predominance of positive period derivatives during stage B in
systems with superhump periods shorter than 0.07 d. There was a systematic
difference in period derivatives for systems with superhump periods longer than
0.075 d between this study and Kato et al. (2009). We suggest that this
difference is possibly caused by the relative lack of frequently outbursting SU
UMa-type dwarf novae in this period regime in the present study. We recorded a
strong beat phenomenon during the 2009 superoutburst of IY UMa. The close
correlation between the beat period and superhump period suggests that the
changing angular velocity of the apsidal motion of the elliptical disk is
responsible for the variation of superhump periods. We also described three new
WZ Sge-type objects with established early superhumps and one with likely early
superhumps. We also suggest that two systems, VX For and EL UMa, are WZ
Sge-type dwarf novae with multiple rebrightenings. The O-C variation in OT
J213806.6+261957 suggests that the frequent absence of rebrightenings in very
short-Porb objects can be a result of sustained superoutburst plateau at the
epoch when usual SU UMa-type dwarf novae return to quiescence preceding a
rebrightening. We also present a formulation for a variety of Bayesian
extension to traditional period analyses.

source of many of the energetic particles observed in space. Large-scale
spatial variations of the magnetic field has been shown to be important in
understanding observations. The effects are complex, so here we consider a
simple, illustrative model. Here, we solve numerically the Parker transport
equation for a shock in the presence of large-scale sinusoidal magnetic-field
variations. We demonstrate that the familiar planar-shock results can be
significantly altered as a consequence of large-scale, meandering magnetic
lines of force. Because perpendicular diffusion coefficient $\kappa_\perp$ is
generally much smaller than parallel diffusion coefficient $\kappa_\parallel$,
the energetic charged particles are trapped and preferentially accelerated
along the shock front in the regions where the connection points of magnetic
field lines intersecting the shock surface converge, and thus create the ""hot
spots"" of the accelerated particles. For the regions where the connection
points separate from each other, the acceleration to high energies will be
suppressed. Further, the particles diffuse away from the ""hot spot"" regions and
modify the spectra of downstream particle distribution. These features are
qualitatively similar to the recent Voyager's observation in the Heliosheath.
These results are potentially important for particle acceleration at shocks
propagating in turbulent magnetized plasmas as well as those which contain
large-scale nonplanar structures. Examples include anomalous cosmic rays
accelerated by the solar wind termination shock, energetic particles observed
in propagating heliospheric shocks, and galactic cosmic rays accelerated by
supernova blast waves, etc.

redshift in the Lyman-alpha equivalent width distribution of distant galaxies
offers a promising probe of the degree of ionization in the intergalactic
medium and hence when cosmic reionization ended. This simple test is
complicated by the fact that Lyman-alpha emission can also be affected by the
evolving astrophysical details of the host galaxies. In the first paper in this
series, we demonstrated both a luminosity and redshift dependent trend in the
fraction of Lyman-alpha emitters seen within color-selected Lyman-break
galaxies (LBGs) over the range 3<z<6; lower luminosity galaxies and those at
higher redshift show an increased likelihood of strong emission. Here we
present the results from much deeper 12.5 hour exposures with the Keck DEIMOS
spectrograph focused primarily on LBGs at z~6 which enable us to confirm the
redshift dependence of line emission more robustly and to higher redshift than
was hitherto possible. We find 54+/-11% of faint z~6 LBGs show strong (W_0>25
A) emission, an increase of 1.6x from a similar sample observed at z~4. With a
total sample of 74 z~6 LBGs, we determine the luminosity-dependent Lyman-alpha
equivalent width distribution. Assuming continuity in these trends to the new
population of z~7 sources located with the Hubble WFC3/IR camera, we predict
that unless the neutral fraction rises in the intervening 200 Myr, the success

criticality/conformality. To reveal the critical behavior of TD, we explicitly
compute the nonperturbative contributions to the scale anomaly
$<\theta^\mu_\mu>$ and to the techni-gluon condensate $<G_{\mu\nu}^2>$, which
are generated by the dynamical mass m of the techni-fermions. Our computation
is based on the (improved) ladder Schwinger-Dyson equation, with the gauge
coupling $\alpha$ replaced by the two-loop running one $\alpha(\mu)$ having the
Caswell-Banks-Zaks IR fixed point $\alpha_*$: $\alpha(\mu) \simeq \alpha =
\alpha_*$ for the IR region $m < \mu < \Lambda_{TC}$, where $\Lambda_{TC}$ is
the intrinsic scale (analogue of $\Lambda_{QCD}$ of QCD) relevant to the
perturbative scale anomaly. We find that $-<\theta^\mu_\mu>/m^4\to const \ne 0$
and $<G_{\mu\nu}^2>/m^4\to (\alpha/\alpha_{cr}-1)^{-3/2}\to\infty$ in the
criticality limit $m/\Lambda_{TC}\sim\exp(-\pi/(\alpha/\alpha_{cr}-1)^{1/2})\to
0$ ($\alpha=\alpha_* \to \alpha_{cr}$) (""conformal edge""). Our result precisely
reproduces the formal identity $<\theta^\mu_\mu>=(\beta(\alpha)/4 \alpha)
<G_{\mu\nu}^2>$, where $\beta(\alpha)=-(2\alpha_{cr}/\pi)
(\alpha/\alpha_{cr}-1)^{3/2}$ is the nonperturbative beta function
corresponding to the above essential singularity scaling of $m/\Lambda_{TC}$.
Accordingly, the PCDC implies $(M_{TD}/m)^2 (F_{TD}/m)^2=-4<\theta_\mu^\mu>/m^4
\to const \ne 0$ at criticality limit, where $M_{TD}$ is the mass of TD and
$F_{TD}$ the decay constant of TD. We thus conclude that at criticality limit
the TD could become a ""true (massless) Nambu-Goldstone boson"" $M_{TD}/m\to 0$,
only when $m/F_{TD}\to 0$, namely getting decoupled, as was the case of

sum of mass and tension densities. Analogous to the case of a moving point
particle, we show that the asymptotically hypercylindrical geometries can be
classified into three types depending on the value of the ""string rest
mass-squared"", namely, ""ordinary string"", ""null string"" and ""tachyonlike
string"" geometries. This asymptotic analysis shows that the extraordinary
metrics reported recently by some of the authors belong to the tachyonlike
string. Consequently, it is likely that such extraordinary solutions are the
final states of tachyonic matter collapse. We also report two new vacuum
solutions which belong to the null string and the tachyonlike string,
respectively.

  LightCone2010, Valencia, June 14th-18th","PoS LC2010:066,2010",,,"nucl-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A distinct feature of Coulomb gauge QCD is that it can be formulated in terms
of physical, transverse gluons and quarks alone. The state-counting is then
transparent, and the gauge is suited for studies of the excited spectrum.
Leaving aside exotic spectroscopy, which has been the subject of other
publications, in this note I call attention on two recent applications. One is
that the running quark mass in the mid-infrared can be probed from excited
baryons thanks to parity doubling, a consequence of insensitivity to chiral
symmetry breaking. Fast quarks are asymptotically free and behave as massless,
so hadrons containing fast quarks decouple from the condensate. Their
(power-law) rate of decoupling reflects on the rate of decreasing parity
splittings, which can be measured. The second is that, in analogy with the
Franck-Condon principle of molecular physics, the velocity distribution of the
heavy quarks inside a heavy hadron can be mapped out by the velocity
distribution of its open-flavor decay products. This is exemplified by recent
data from the Belle collaboration taken at the Upsilon(10860).

electron correlation effect in FeSe. The self energy correction provides the
larger mass enhancement value (Z^-1=3.6) than in Fe-As superconductors and
enables us to separate a incoherent part from the spectrum. These features are
quite consistent with the results of recent dynamical mean-field calculations,
in which the incoherent part is attributed to the lower Hubbard band.

cumulants which are additive in terms of the input state and the resource of
teleportation. Working with Squeezed Bell-like states, which may be optimized
in a free parameter for better teleportation performance we discuss the
relation between resources optimal for fidelity and for different observable
averages. We obtain the values of the free parameter which optimize the central
momenta and cumulants up to fourth order. For the cumulants the distortion
between in and out states due to teleportation depends only on the resource. We
obtain optimal parameters for the second and fourth order cumulants which do
not depend on the squeezing of the resource. The second order central momenta
which is equal to the second order cumulants and the photon number average are
optimized by the same resource. We show that the optimal fidelity resource,
found in reference (Phys. Rev. A {\bf 76}, 022301 (2007)) to depend also on the
characteristics of input, tends for high squeezing to the resource which
optimizes the second order momenta. A similar behavior is obtained for the
resource which optimizes the photon statistics which is treated here using the
sum of the squared differences in photon probabilities of input and output
states as the distortion measure. This is interpreted to mean that the
distortions associated to second order momenta dominates the behavior of the
output state for large squeezing of the resource. Optimal fidelity and optimal
photon statistics resources are compared and is shown that for mixtures of Fock

transiting planet belongs to a differen t species than all transiting planets
previously found. Current models suggest that this is the first transiting
rocky planet found outside the solar system. Given that the planet orbits a
solar-like star at a distance of on ly 4.5 R*, it is expected that material
released from its surface may then form an exosphere. AIMS: We constrai n the
properties of the exosphere by observing the planet in- and out-of-transit.
Detecting of the exosphere of CoRoT-7b would for the first time allow to study
the material originating in the surface of a rocky extrasolar planet. We scan
the entire optical spectrum for any lines originating from the planet, focusing
particularly on spectral lines such as those detected in Mercury, and Io in our
solar system. METHODS: Since lines originating in the exosphere are expected to
be narrow, we observed CoRoT-7b at high resolution with UVES on the VLT. By
subtracting the two spectra from each other, we search for emission and
absorption lines originating in the exosph ere of CoRoT-7b. RESULTS: In the
first step, we focus on Ca I, Ca II, Na, because these lines have been detected
in Mercury. Since the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the spectra is as high as
300, we derive firm upper limits for the flux-range between 1.6E-18 and 3.2E-18
Wm**-2. For CaO, we find an upper limit of E-17 Wm**-2. We also search for
emission lines originating in the plasma torus fed by volcanic activity and
derive upper limits for these lines. In the whole spectrum we finally try to
identify other lines originating in the planet.

below 4 mHz and propagating waves for higher frequencies, and allows us to
infer the temperature and height where the lines are formed. Using these
observational data, we have constructed a model of sunspot, and we have
introduced the velocity measured with the photospheric Si I 1082.7 nm line as a
driver. The numerically propagated wave pattern fits reasonably well with the
observed using the lines formed at higher layers, and the simulations reproduce
many of the observed features. The observed waves are slow MHD waves
propagating longitudinally along field lines.

predictions obtained from hydrodynamical simulations to investigate the angular
correlation properties of the WHIM in emission and assess the possibility of
indirect detection with next-generation X-ray missions. Our results indicate
that the angular correlation signal of the WHIM is generally weak but dominates
the angular correlation function of the DXB outside virialized regions. Its
indirect detection is possible but requires rather long exposure times [0.1-1]
Ms, large (~1{\deg} x1{\deg}) fields of view and accurate subtraction of
isotropic fore/background contributions, mostly contributed by Galactic
emission. The angular correlation function of the WHIM is positive for {\theta}
< 5' and provides limited information on its spatial distribution. A
satisfactory characterization of the WHIM in 3D can be obtained through
spatially resolved spectroscopy. 1 Ms long exposures with next generation
detectors will allow to detect ~400 O VII+O VIII X-ray emission systems that we
use to trace the spatial distribution of the WHIM. We predict that these
observations will allow to estimate the WHIM correlation function with high
statistical significance out to ~10 Mpc h^-1 and characterize its dynamical
state through the analysis of redshift-space distortions. The detectable WHIM,
which is typically associated with the outskirts of virialized regions rather

from the LSND, KARMEN and MiniBooNE experiments. We show that the LSND evidence
for $\bar{\nu}_\mu \to \bar{\nu}_e$ oscillations, its long-standing
disagreement with the results from KARMEN, and the anomalous event excess
observed by MiniBooNE in $\nu_\mu$ and $\bar{\nu}_\mu$ data could all be
explained by the existence of a heavy sterile neutrino ($\nu_h$). All these
results are found to be consistent with each other assuming that the $\nu_h$ is
created in $\nu_\mu$ neutral-current interactions and decays radiatively into a
photon and a light neutrino. Assuming the $\nu_h$ is produced through mixing
with $\nu_\mu$, the combined analysis of the LSND and MiniBooNe excess events
suggests that the $\nu_h$ mass is in the range from 40 to 80 MeV, the mixing
strength is $|U_{\mu h}|^2 \simeq 10^{-3}-10^{-2}$, and the lifetime is
$\tau_{\nu_h} \lesssim 10^{-9}$ s. Surprisingly, this LSND-MiniBooNE parameters
window is found to be unconstrained by the results from the most sensitive
experiments searching for heavy neutrino. We set new limits on $|U_{\mu h}|^2$
for the LSND-MiniBooNE favorable mass region from the precision measurements of
the Michel spectrum by the TWIST experiment. The results obtained provide a
strong motivation for a sensitive search for the $\nu_h$ in a near future $ K$
decay or neutrino experiments, which fit well in the existing/planned
experimental programs at CERN or FNAL. The question of whether the heavy
neutrino is Dirac or Majorana particle is briefly discussed.

V20 in the open cluster NGC 6791 were accurate enough to demonstrate that there
are significant differences between current stellar models. Here we improve on
those results and add measurements of two additional detached eclipsing
binaries, the cluster members V18 and V80. The enlarged sample sets much
tighter constraints on the properties of stellar models than has hitherto been
possible, thereby improving both the accuracy and precision of the cluster age.
We employed (i) high-resolution UVES spectroscopy of V18, V20 and V80 to
determine their spectroscopic effective temperatures, [Fe/H] values, and
spectroscopic orbital elements, and (ii) time-series photometry from the Nordic
Optical Telescope to obtain the photometric elements. The masses and radii of
the V18 and V20 components are found to high accuracy, with errors on the
masses in the range 0.27-0.36% and errors on the radii in the range 0.61-0.92%.
V80 is found to be magnetically active, and more observations are needed to
determine its parameters accurately. The metallicity of NGC 6791 is measured
from disentangled spectra of the binaries and a few single stars to be [Fe/H]=
+0.29 \pm 0.03 (random) \pm 0.07 (systematic). The cluster reddening and
apparent distance modulus are found to be E(B - V) = 0.160 \pm 0.025 and (m -
M)V = 13.51 \pm 0.06 . A first model comparison shows that we can constrain the
helium content of the NGC 6791 stars, and thus reach a more accurate age than
previously possible. It may be possible to constrain additional parameters, in
particular the C, N, and O abundances. This will be investigated in paper II.

  In addition, we prove a strong implication that the working-set property is

cubic, three dimensionally connected material, Zn(CN)2, is negative ({\alpha}V
= -51 x 10-6 K-1) while for Ni(CN)2, a tetragonal material, the thermal
expansion coefficient is negative in the two dimensionally connected sheets
({\alpha}a=-7 x 10-6 K-1), but the overall thermal expansion coefficient is
positive ({\alpha}V=48 x 10-6 K-1). We have measured the temperature dependence
of phonon spectra in these compounds and analyzed them using ab-initio
calculations. The spectra of the two compounds show large differences that
cannot be explained by simple mass renormalization of the modes involving Zn
(65.38 amu) and Ni (58.69 amu) atoms. This reflects the fact that the structure
and bonding are quite different in the two compounds. The calculated pressure
dependence of the phonon modes and of the thermal expansion coefficient,
{\alpha}V, are used to understand the anomalous behavior in these compounds.
Our ab-initio calculations indicate that it is the low-energy rotational modes
in Zn(CN)2, which are shifted to higher energies in Ni(CN)2, that are
responsible for the large negative thermal expansion. The measured temperature
dependence of the phonon spectra has been used to estimate the total
anharmonicity of both compounds. For Zn(CN)2, the temperature- dependent
measurements (total anharmonicity), along with our previously reported pressure
dependence of the phonon spectra (quasiharmonic), is used to separate the
explicit temperature effect at constant volume (intrinsic anharmonicity).

amino acid depends mainly on its number of electrons (reflecting its size) and
consequently cannot be used to cluster the amino acids in different biochemical
groups, in contrast to the local softness. Our results also demonstrate that
the global softness is not simply proportional to the global polarizability in
disagreement with the intuition that ""a softer moiety is also more
polarizable"". Amino acids with the same softness may have a polarizability
differing by a factor as large as 1.7. This discrepancy can be understood from
first principles as we show that the molecular polarizability depends on a
""softness dipole vector"" and not simply on the global softness.

system is estimated to operate at the maximum speed of approximately 16 ms per

stress-imbalances within the system are continuously generated by the
coarsening process, which unlike thermal fluctuations, can be conveniently
quantified by optical means. However, the high turbidity of foams generally
hinders the detailed study of the temporal and spatial distribution of
rearrangement events, such that definite assessments regarding their
contribution to the overall dynamics could not be made so far. In this paper,
we use novel light scattering techniques to measure the frequency and position
of events within a large sample volume. As recently reported (A. S. Gittings
and D. J. Durian, Phys. Rev. E, 2008, 78, 066313), we find that the foam
dynamics is determined by two distinct processes: intermittent bubble
rearrangements of finite duration and a spatially homogeneous quasicontinuous
process. Our experiments show that the convolution of these two processes
determines the age-dependence of the mean dynamics, such that relations between
intermittent rearrangements and coarsening process can not be established by
considering means. By contrast the use of the recently introduced photon
correlation imaging technique (A. Duri, D. A. Sessoms, V. Trappe, and L.
Cipelletti, Phys. Rev. Lett., 2009, 102, 085702) enables us to assess that the
event frequency is directly determined by the strain-rate imposed by the
coarsening process. Surprisingly, we also find that, although the distribution
of successive events in time is consistent with a random process, the spatial
distribution of successive events is not random: rearrangements are more likely
to occur within a recently rearranged zone. This implies that a topological
rearrangement is likely to lead to an unstable configuration, such that a small
amount of coarsening-induced strain is sufficient to trigger another event.

in terms of redundant components of equal weight. They are known to be
exceptionally robust against additive noise and erasures, and as such, have
great potential as encoding schemes. Unfortunately, up to this point, these
frames have proven notoriously difficult to construct. Indeed, though the set
of all unit norm tight frames, modulo rotations, is known to contain manifolds
of nontrivial dimension, we have but a small finite number of known
constructions of such frames. In this paper, we present a new iterative
algorithm---gradient descent of the frame potential---for increasing the degree
of tightness of any finite unit norm frame. The algorithm itself is trivial to
implement, and it preserves certain group structures present in the initial
frame. In the special case where the number of frame elements is relatively
prime to the dimension of the underlying space, we show that this algorithm
converges to a unit norm tight frame at a linear rate, provided the initial
unit norm frame is already sufficiently close to being tight. By slightly
modifying this approach, we get a similar, but weaker, result in the
non-relatively-prime case, providing an explicit answer to the Paulsen problem:

many applications in mass, force, magnetic resonance, and displacement sensing.
Reducing cantilever size to nanoscale dimensions can improve the bandwidth and
sensitivity of techniques like atomic force microscopy, but current optical
transduction methods suffer when the cantilever is small compared to the
achievable spot size. Here, we demonstrate sensitive optical transduction in a
monolithic cavity-optomechanical system in which a sub-picogram silicon
cantilever with a sharp probe tip is separated from a microdisk optical
resonator by a nanoscale gap. High quality factor (Q ~ 10^5) microdisk optical
modes transduce the cantilever's MHz frequency thermally-driven vibrations with
a displacement sensitivity of ~ 4.4x10^-16 m\sqrt[2]{Hz} and bandwidth > 1 GHz,
and a dynamic range > 10^6 is estimated for a 1 s measurement.
Optically-induced stiffening due to the strong optomechanical interaction is
observed, and engineering of probe dynamics through cantilever design and
electrostatic actuation is illustrated.

discrete last-passage percolation models close to the axis. It allowed to
compute some explicit limits and prove fluctuation theorems for these, based on
the relations between the Brownian percolation and random matrices.
  Here, we present two approaches that allow to treat discrete asymmetric
models of directed polymers. In both cases, the behaviour is universal, meaning
that the results do not depend on the precise law of the environment as long as
it satisfies some natural moment assumptions.
  First, we establish an approximation of asymmetric discrete directed polymers
in random environments at very high temperature by a continuous-time directed
polymers model in a Brownian environment, much in the same way than the last
passage percolation case. The key ingredient is a strong embedding argument
developed by K\'omlos, Major and T\'usnady.
  Then, we study the partition function of a $1+1$-dimensional directed polymer
in a random environment with a drift tending to infinity. We give an explicit
expression for the free energy based on known asymptotics for last-passage
percolation and compute the order of the fluctuations of the partition
function. We conjecture that the law of the properly rescaled fluctuations
converges to the GUE Tracy-Widom distribution.

the NGC 1893 young open cluster region along with V-band polarimetric
observations of stars of other four open clusters located between l ~160 to
~175 degree. We found evidence for the presence of two dust layers located at a
distance of ~170 pc and ~360 pc. The dust layers produce a polarization Pv
~2.2%. It is evident from the clusters studied in the present work that, in the
Galactic longitude range l ~160 to 175 degree and within the Galactic plane
(|b| < 2 degree), the polarization angles remain almost constant, with a mean
~163 degree and a dispersion of 6 degree. The small dispersion in polarization
angle could be due to the presence of uniform dust layer beyond 1 kpc. Present
observations reveal that in case of NGC 1893, the foreground two dust layers,
in addition to the intracluster medium, seems to be responsible for the
polarization effects. It is also found that towards the direction of NGC 1893,
the dust layer that exists between 2-3 kpc has a negligible contribution
towards the total observed polarization. The weighted mean for percentage of
polarization (Pmax) and the wavelength at maximum polarization ({\lambda}max)
are found to be 2.59 \pm 0.02% and 0.55 \pm 0.01 \mum respectively. The
estimated mean value of {\lambda}max indicates that the average size of the
dust grains within the cluster is similar to that in the general interstellar
medium. The spatial variation of the polarization is found to decrease towards
the outer region of the cluster. In the present work, we support the notion, as
already has been shown in previous studies, that polarimetry, in combination
with (U-B)/(B-V) colour-colour diagram, is a useful tool for identifying

magnetic wind of exploding Wolf Rayet and Red Super Giant stars is that the
final spectrum is a composition of a spectrum $E^{-7/3}$ and a polar cap
component of $E^{-2}$ at the source. This polar cap component contributes to
the total energy content with only a few percent, but dominates the spectrum at
higher energy. The sum of both components gives spectra which curve upwards.
The upturn was predicted to occur always at the same rigidity. An additional
component of cosmic rays from acceleration by supernovae exploding into the
Inter-Stellar Medium (ISM) adds another component for Hydrogen and for Helium.
After transport the predicted spectra $J(E)$ for the wind-SN cosmic rays are
$E^{-8/3}$ and $E^{-7/3}$; the sum leads to an upturn from the steeper
spectrum. An upturn has now been seen. Here, we test the observations against
the predictions, and show that the observed properties are consistent with the
predictions. Hydrogen can be shown to also have a noticeable wind-SN-component.
The observation of the upturn in the heavy element spectra being compatible
with the same rigidity for all heavy elements supports the magneto-rotational
mechanism for these supernovae. This interpretation predicts the observed
upturn to continue to curve upwards and approach the $E^{-7/3}$ spectrum. If
confirmed, this would strengthen the case that supernovae of very massive stars
with magnetic winds are important sources of Galactic cosmic rays.

reformulation of vacuum general relativity in terms of two-form frames and
connection one-forms, and provides a covariant basis for various quantization
approaches. Using the spinor formalism we prove the consistency of the newly
proposed matter coupling by demonstrating the full equivalence of Plebanski
gravity plus matter to Einstein--Cartan gravity. As a byproduct we also show
the consistency of some previous suggestions for matter actions.

vertically-isothermal Keplerian discs. Solutions of the stability problem are
found explicitly by asymptotic expansions in the small aspect ratio of the
disc. In both equilibrium configurations the perturbations are decoupled into
in-plane and vertical modes. For equilibria of type I those two modes are the
Alfv\'en-Coriolis and sound waves, while for equilibria of type II they are the
inertia-Coriolis and magnetosonic waves. Exact expressions for the growth rates
as well as the number of unstable modes for type I equilibria are derived.
Those are the discrete counterpart of the continuous infinite homogeneous
cylinder magnetorotational (MRI) spectrum. It is further shown that the
axisymmetric MRI is completely suppressed by dominant toroidal magnetic fields
(i.e. equilibria of type II). This renders the system prone to either
non-axisymmetric MRI or non-modal algebraic growth mechanisms. The algebraic
growth mechanism investigated in the present study occurs exclusively due to
the rotation shear, generates the inertia-Coriolis driven magnetosonic modes
due to non-resonant or resonant coupling that induces, respectively, linear or

interferometry was abandoned more than 40 years ago, it is capable of imaging
and thus accomplishing more than the measurement of stellar diameters as was
previously thought. Various phase retrieval techniques can be used to
reconstruct actual images provided a sufficient coverage of the interferometric
plane is available. Planned large arrays of Air Cherenkov telescopes will
provide thousands of simultaneously available baselines ranging from a few tens
of meters to over a kilometer, thus making imaging possible with unprecedented
angular resolution. Here we investigate the imaging capabilities of arrays such
as CTA or AGIS used as Stellar Intensity Interferometry receivers. The study
makes use of simulated data as could realistically be obtained from these
arrays. A Cauchy-Riemann based phase recovery allows the reconstruction of
images which can be compared to the pristine image for which the data were
simulated. This is first done for uniform disk stars with different radii and
corresponding to various exposure times, and we find that the uncertainty in
reconstructing radii is a few percent after a few hours of exposure time.
Finally, more complex images are considered, showing that imaging at the

the appropriate Fokker- Planck equation in the overdamped limit. It is also
shown that the asymptotic time solution for probability corresponds to the

that the tipping time tends to infinity as the parameter corresponding to the

acoustic and magnetic mode can exchange energy depending on the angle between
the wave vector and the magnetic field vector. Our results show that above the
equipartition layer and in all three cases the fast magnetic mode is refracted
back into the solar atmosphere. Thus, the magnetic wave shows an evanescent
behavior in the chromosphere. The acoustic mode, which travels along the
magnetic field in the low plasma-$\beta$ regime, can be a direct consequence of
an acoustic source within or outside the low-$\beta$ regime, or it can result
from conversion of the magnetic mode, possibly from several such conversions
when the wave travels across a series of equipartition layers.

consistent with shock excitation in regions of dense (approx. 10^7 cm^-3) gas
with shock velocities in the range 25 - 30 km/s. The distribution of H2
emission in the bipolar lobes suggests that a fast wind is impinging on
material in the cavity walls and tips. H2 emission is also seen along a line of
sight close to the obscured star as well as in the equatorial region to either
side of the stellar position which has the appearance of a ring with radius 0.3
arcsec. This latter feature may be radially cospatial with the boundary between
the AGB and post-AGB winds. The first overtone 12^CO bandheads are observed
longward of 2.29 {\mu}m with the v = 2-0 bandhead prominently in emission. The
CO emission has the same spatial distribution as the K-band continuum and
therefore originates from an unresolved central source close to the star. We
interpret this as evidence for ongoing mass loss in this object. This
conclusion is further supported by a rising K-band continuum indicating the
presence of warm dust close to the star, possibly down to the condensation
radius. The red-shifted scattered peak of the CO bandhead is used to estimate a
dust velocity along the bipolar axis of 95 km/s for the collimated wind. This
places a lower limit of approx. 125 yr on the age of the bipolar cavities,
meaning that the collimated fast wind turned on very soon after the cessation

An initial step for producing the weekly schedule is forecasting the future
system loads which involves predicting both arrival counts and average service
times. We introduce an arrival count model which is based on a mixed Poisson
process approach. The model is applied to data from an Israeli Telecom company
call center. In our model, we also consider the effect of events such as
billing on the arrival process and we demonstrate how to incorporate them as
exogenous variables in the model. After obtaining the forecasted system load,
in large call centers, a manager can choose to apply the QED
(Quality-Efficiency Driven) regime's ""square-root staffing"" rule in order to
balance the offered-load per server with the quality of service. Implementing
this staffing rule requires that the forecasted values of the arrival counts
and average service times maintain certain levels of precision. We develop
different goodness of fit criteria that help determine our model's practical
performance under the QED regime. These show that during most hours of the day
the model can reach desired precision levels.

Indian Trust) were constructed from data related to money collected in the
system and disbursed by the system from 1887 to 2007. The data set of fiscal
year accounting information had a high proportion of missing values, and much
of the available data did not satisfy basic accounting relationships. Instead
of just calculating a single estimate and arguing to the Court that the
assumptions needed for the computation were reasonable, a distribution of
calculated balances was developed using multiple imputation and time series
models. These provided information to assess the uncertainty of the estimate
due to missing and questionable data.

the increasing availability of high dimensional data in which are buried
important information. A current urgent challenge to statisticians is to
develop effective methods of finding the useful information from the vast
amounts of messy and noisy data available, most of which are noninformative.
This paper presents a general computer intensive approach, based on a method
pioneered by Lo and Zheng for detecting which, of many potential explanatory
variables, have an influence on a dependent variable $Y$. This approach is
suited to detect influential variables, where causal effects depend on the
confluence of values of several variables. It has the advantage of avoiding a
difficult direct analysis, involving possibly thousands of variables, by
dealing with many randomly selected small subsets from which smaller subsets
are selected, guided by a measure of influence $I$. The main objective is to
discover the influential variables, rather than to measure their effects. Once
they are detected, the problem of dealing with a much smaller group of
influential variables should be vulnerable to appropriate analysis. In a sense,
we are confining our attention to locating a few needles in a haystack.

synchrony/time-series experiments used to study important cellular processes.
Its formulation is constructive, based on an accounting of the unique cohorts
in the population as they arise and evolve over time, allowing it to be written
in closed form. The model can attribute effects to subsets of the population,
providing flexibility not available using the models historically applied to
these populations. It provides a tool for in silico synchronization of the
population and can be used to deconvolve population-level experimental
measurements, such as temporal expression profiles. It also allows for the
direct comparison of assay measurements made from multiple experiments. The
model can be fit either to budding index or DNA content measurements, or both,
and is easily adaptable to new forms of data. The ability to use DNA content
data makes the model applicable to almost any organism. We describe the model
and illustrate its utility and flexibility in a study of cell cycle progression
in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

space is the $d$-dimensional nonnegative orthant. The data for such a process
are a drift vector $\theta$, a nonsingular $d\times d$ covariance matrix
$\Sigma$, and a $d\times d$ reflection matrix $R$ that specifies the boundary
behavior of $Z$. We say that $Z$ is positive recurrent, or stable, if the
expected time to hit an arbitrary open neighborhood of the origin is finite for
every starting state. In dimension $d=2$, necessary and sufficient conditions
for stability are known, but fundamentally new phenomena arise in higher
dimensions. Building on prior work by El Kharroubi, Ben Tahar and Yaacoubi
[Stochastics Stochastics Rep. 68 (2000) 229--253, Math. Methods Oper. Res. 56
(2002) 243--258], we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for stability
of SRBMs in three dimensions; to verify or refute these conditions is a simple
computational task. As a byproduct, we find that the fluid-based criterion of
Dupuis and Williams [Ann. Probab. 22 (1994) 680--702] is not only sufficient
but also necessary for stability of SRBMs in three dimensions. That is, an SRBM
in three dimensions is positive recurrent if and only if every path of the
associated fluid model is attracted to the origin. The problem of recurrence
classification for SRBMs in four and higher dimensions remains open.

equation as the particle number tends to infinity. The mass flow equation is in
one-to-one correspondence with Smoluchowski's coagulation equation. We prove
uniqueness for this equation in a broad class of solutions, to which the weak
limit of the stochastic system is shown to belong.

stochastic processes belong to the class of self-interacting Markov chains. In
contrast to traditional Markov chains, their time evolutions depend on the
occupation measure of their past values. This general methodology allows us to
provide a natural way to sample from a sequence of target probability measures
of increasing complexity. We develop an original theoretical analysis to
analyze the behavior of these iterative algorithms which relies on
measure-valued processes and semigroup techniques. We establish a variety of
convergence results including exponential estimates and a uniform convergence
theorem with respect to the number of target distributions. We also illustrate
these algorithms in the context of Feynman-Kac distribution flows.

the data are present as movies, or, more prosaically, time series of images.
This paper describes novel uses of singular value decompositions (SVD) and
weighted versions of them (WSVD) to extract the signals from such movies, in a
way that is semi-automatic and tuned closely to the actual data and their many
complexities. These complexities include the following. First, the images
themselves are of no interest: all interest focuses on the behavior of
individual cells across time, and thus, the cells need to be segmented in an
automated manner. Second, the cells themselves have 100$+$ pixels, so that they
form 100$+$ curves measured over time, so that data compression is required to
extract the features of these curves. Third, some of the pixels in some of the
cells are subject to image saturation due to bit depth limits, and this
saturation needs to be accounted for if one is to normalize the images in a
reasonably unbiased manner. Finally, the $\mathrm {Ca}^{2+}$ signals have
oscillations or waves that vary with time and these signals need to be
extracted. Thus, our aim is to show how to use multiple weighted and standard
singular value decompositions to detect, extract and clarify the $\mathrm
{Ca}^{2+}$ signals. Our signal extraction methods then lead to simple although
finely focused statistical methods to compare $\mathrm {Ca}^{2+}$ signals
across experimental conditions.
