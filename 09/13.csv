separated dipolar quantum fluids, and in particular of dipolar excitons in GaAs
bilayer based devices. The method utilizes the static electric dipole moment of
trapped dipolar fluids to induce a local potential change on spatially
separated test dipoles. We show that such an interaction can be used for a
model- independent, objective fluid density measurements, an outstanding
problem in this field of research, as well as for inter-fluid exciton flow
control and trapping. For a demonstration of the effects on realistic devices,
we use a full two-dimensional hydrodynamical model.

second-order unconditionally stable numerical scheme for the stochastic
equations proposed. Accuracy and consistency of the numerical scheme is
demonstrated analytically. In the last part of the work, we study the fluid
flow in a channel flow with the proposed viscous method. A peculiar approach is
chosen: the flow is solved with a Eulerian method and after with the Lagrangian
model proposed which uses some of the Eulerian quantities. In this way
attention is devoted to the issue of consistency in hybrid Eulerian/Lagrangian
methods. It is shown that the coupling is important indeed and that to couple
the Lagrangian model to an Eulerian one which is not consistent with the same
turbulence physics leads to large errors. This part of the work complements a

emergent force, with far reaching consequences. Using the Hawking-Bekenstein
entropy formulation, we arrive at the conclusion that the Mass-Boom effect,
presented elsewhere, forces the entropy of the universe to increase. Then the
Mass-Boom is directly related to the existence of gravity. The principle of
Mach implies that the Mass-Boom is responsible for the expansion of the
universe. Thus, the Mass-Boom effect is a necessary condition for: 1) the
increase of entropy with time, 2) the existence of gravity, and 3) for the
expansion of the universe. The universe seems to initially appear and grow out
of polarization: positive mass-boom (energy) versus negative gravitational
potential energy boom, adding both always to zero. Polarization is then the
cause of creation and evolution of the universe.

measured apparent jet speeds, in many cases significantly reducing the
statistical error over previously published results. With the increased
resolution at 43 GHz, we detect new components within 0.1-0.2 mas of the core
in most of these sources. No motion is apparent in these new components over
the time span of our observations, and we place upper limits on the apparent

eavesdropper's channel and focuses on maximizing secrecy capacity, we consider
the case where no information regarding the eavesdropper is available, and we
use signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) as our performance metric.
Specifically, we focus on the problem of maximizing the amount of power
available to broadcast a jamming signal intended to hide the desired signal
from a potential eavesdropper, while maintaining a prespecified SINR at the
desired receiver. The jamming signal is designed to be orthogonal to the
information signal when it reaches the desired receiver, assuming both the
receiver and the eavesdropper employ optimal beamformers and possess exact
channel state information (CSI). In practice, the assumption of perfect CSI at
the transmitter is often difficult to justify. Therefore, we also study the
resulting performance degradation due to the presence of imperfect CSI, and we
present robust beamforming schemes that recover a large fraction of the
performance in the perfect CSI case. Numerical simulations verify our
analytical performance predictions, and illustrate the benefit of the robust

frame where the Higgs field of the next to minimal supersymmetric standard
model (NMSSM) plays the role of the inflaton. Previous attempts which assumed
non-minimal coupling to gravity failed due to a tachyonic instability of the
singlet field during inflation. A canonical K\""{a}hler potential with
\textit{minimal coupling} to gravity can resolve the tachyonic instability but
runs into the $\eta$-problem. We suggest a model which is free of the
$\eta$-problem due to an additional coupling in the K\""{a}hler potential which
is allowed by the Standard Model gauge group. This induces directions in the
potential which we call K-flat. For a certain value of the new coupling in the
(N)MSSM, the K\""{a}hler potential is special, because it can be associated with
a certain shift symmetry for the Higgs doublets, a generalization of the shift
symmetry for singlets in earlier models. We find that K-flat direction has
$H_u^0=-H_d^{0*}.$ This shift symmetry is broken by interactions coming from
the superpotential and gauge fields. This direction fails to produce successful
inflation in the MSSM but produces a viable model in the NMSSM. The model is
specifically interesting in the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) limit of the NMSSM. In this
limit the model can be confirmed or ruled-out not just by cosmic microwave
background observations but also by axion searches.

suggest that the gamma-ray emission from globular clusters may result from the
inverse Compton scattering between relativistic electrons/positrons in the
pulsar wind of MSPs in the globular clusters and background soft photons
including cosmic microwave/relic photons, background star lights in the
clusters, the galactic infrared photons and the galactic star lights. We show
that the gamma-ray spectrum from 47 Tuc can be explained equally well by upward
scattering of either the relic photons, the galactic infrared photons or the
galactic star lights whereas the gamma-ray spectra from other seven globular
clusters are best fitted by the upward scattering of either the galactic
infrared photons or the galactic star lights. We also find that the observed
gamma-ray luminosity is correlated better with the combined factor of the
encounter rate and the background soft photon energy density. Therefore the
inverse Compton scattering may also contribute to the observed gamma-ray
emission from globular clusters detected by Fermi in addition to the standard
curvature radiation process. Furthermore, we find that the emission region of
high energy photons from globular cluster produced by inverse Compton
scattering is substantially larger than the core of globular cluster with a
radius >10pc. The diffuse radio and X-rays emitted from globular clusters can
also be produced by synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton scattering
respectively. We suggest that future observations including radio, X-rays, and
gamma-rays with energy higher than 10 GeV and better angular resolution can
provide better constraints for the models.

peer-to-peer media streaming (namely tree-based push and mesh-based pull),
there is a strong trend of combining them into a hybrid streaming system.
Backed by recently proposed mechanisms to identify stable peers, such a hybrid
system usually consists of backbone trees formed by the stable peers and other
overlay structures in the second tier to accommodate the remaining peers. In
this paper, we embrace the hybrid push-pull structure for peer-to-peer media
streaming. Our protocol is dominated by a multi-tree push mechanism to minimize
the delay in the backbone and is complemented by other overlay structures to
cope with peer dynamics. What mainly distinguishes our multi-tree pushing from
the conventional ones is an unbalanced tree design guided by the so called
snow-ball streaming, which has a provable minimum delay and can be smoothly
""melded"" with virtually any other existing overlay structures lying in the
second tier. We design algorithms to construct and maintain our SNowbAll
multi-tree Pushing (SNAP) overlay, and we also illustrate how to smoothly weld
the SNAP backbone with the second tier. Finally, we perform simulations in
ns-2; the results indicate that our approach outperforms a recently proposed

biochemical logic research has been achieving scalability for complex network
designs. Various logic gates have been realized, but a ""toolbox"" of analog
elements for interconnectivity and signal processing has remained elusive.
Filters are important as network elements that allow control of noise in signal
transmission and conversion. We report a versatile biochemical filtering
mechanism designed to have sigmoidal response in combination with
signal-conversion process. Horseradish peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of
chromogenic electron donor by hydrogen peroxide, was altered by adding
ascorbate, allowing to selectively suppress the output signal, modifying the
response from convex to sigmoidal. A kinetic model was developed for evaluation
of the quality of filtering. The results offer improved capabilities for design
of scalable biomolecular information processing systems.

become a major clinical concern. Recently, iterative reconstruction algorithms
with Total Variation (TV) regularization have been developed to reconstruct CT
images from highly undersampled data acquired at low mAs levels in order to
reduce the imaging dose. Nonetheless, TV regularization may lead to
over-smoothed images and lost edge information. To solve this problem, in this
work we develop an iterative CT reconstruction algorithm with edge-preserving
TV regularization to reconstruct CT images from highly undersampled data
obtained at low mAs levels. The CT image is reconstructed by minimizing an
energy consisting of an edge-preserving TV norm and a data fidelity term posed
by the x-ray projections. The edge-preserving TV term is proposed to
preferentially perform smoothing only on non-edge part of the image in order to
avoid over-smoothing, which is realized by introducing a penalty weight to the
original total variation norm. Our iterative algorithm is implemented on GPU to
improve its speed. We test our reconstruction algorithm on a digital NCAT
phantom, a physical chest phantom, and a Catphan phantom. Reconstruction
results from a conventional FBP algorithm and a TV regularization method
without edge preserving penalty are also presented for comparison purpose. The
experimental results illustrate that both TV-based algorithm and our
edge-preserving TV algorithm outperform the conventional FBP algorithm in
suppressing the streaking artifacts and image noise under the low dose context.
Our edge-preserving algorithm is superior to the TV-based algorithm in that it
can preserve more information of fine structures and therefore maintain
acceptable spatial resolution.

to it. We propose and study a minimal model of signaling network that can sense
and respond to external stimuli of varying strength in an adaptive manner. The
structure of this minimal network is derived based on some simple assumptions
on its differential response to external stimuli. We employ stochastic
differential equations and probability distributions obtained from stochastic
simulations to characterize differential signaling response in our minimal
network model. We show that the proposed minimal signaling network displays two
distinct types of response as the strength of the stimulus is decreased. The
signaling network has a deterministic part that undergoes rapid activation by a
strong stimulus in which case cell-to-cell fluctuations can be ignored. As the
strength of the stimulus decreases, the stochastic part of the network begins
dominating the signaling response where slow activation is observed with
characteristic large cell-to-cell stochastic variability. Interestingly, this
proposed stochastic signaling network can capture some of the essential
signaling behaviors of a complex apoptotic cell death signaling network that
has been studied through experiments and large-scale computer simulations. Thus
we claim that the proposed signaling network is an appropriate minimal model of
apoptosis signaling. Elucidating the fundamental design principles of complex
cellular signaling pathways such as apoptosis signaling remains a challenging
task. We demonstrate how our proposed minimal model can help elucidate the
effect of a specific apoptotic inhibitor Bcl-2 on apoptotic signaling in a
cell-type independent manner. We also discuss the implications of our study in
elucidating the adaptive strategy of cell death signaling pathways.

recognized to confer such resistance. Development of new experimental
strategies, such as in silico modeling of biological pathways, can increase our
understanding of how abnormal regulation of apoptotic pathway in cancer cells
can lead to tumour chemoresistance. Monte Carlo simulations are in particular
well suited to study inherent variability, such as spatial heterogeneity and
cell-to-cell variations in signaling reactions. Using this approach, often in
combination with experimental validation of the computational model, we
observed that large cell-to-cell variability could explain the kinetics of
apoptosis, which depends on the type of pathway and the strength of stress
stimuli. Most importantly, Monte Carlo simulations of apoptotic signaling
provides unexpected insights into the mechanisms of fractional cell killing
induced by apoptosis-inducing agents, showing that not only variation in

We analysed the spectra from four radius-expansion bursts detected in 2006
July, and two in 2002 March, but found no evidence for discrete features. We
estimate upper limits for the equivalent widths of edges of a few hundred eV,
which for the moderate temperatures observed during the bursts, are comparable
with the predictions. During the 2006 July observation 4U 1728-34 exhibited
weak, unusually frequent bursts (separated by <2 hr in some cases), with
profiles and alpha-values characteristic of hydrogen-poor fuel. Recurrence
times as short as those measured are insufficient to exhaust the accreted
hydrogen at solar composition, suggesting that the source accretes hydrogen
deficient fuel, for example from an evolved donor. The detection for the first
time of a 10.77 min periodic signal in the persistent intensity, perhaps
arising from orbital modulation, supports this explanation, and suggests that

than 44,000 spectra allows us to identify an empirical baseline floor for
chromospheric activity as a function of color and height above the main
sequence. We define $\Delta S$ as an excess in emission in the Ca II H\&K lines
above the baseline activity floor and define radial velocity jitter as a
function of $\Delta S$ and \bv\ for main sequence and subgiant stars. Although
the jitter for any individual star can always exceed the baseline level, we
find that K dwarfs have the lowest level of jitter. The lack of correlation
between observed jitter and chromospheric activity in K dwarfs suggests that
the observed jitter is dominated by instrumental or analysis errors and not
astrophysical noise sources. Thus, given the long-term precision for the CPS
program, radial velocities are not correlated with astrophysical noise for
chromospherically quiet K dwarf stars, making these stars particularly
well-suited for the highest precision Doppler surveys. Chromospherically quiet
F and G dwarfs and subgiants exhibit higher baseline levels of astrophysical
jitter than K dwarfs. Despite the fact that the \rms\ in Doppler velocities is
correlated with the mean chromospheric activity, it is rare to see one-to-one

explored whose aim is to obtain distance bounds on beliefs when LBP fails to
converge. In this paper, we derive uniform and non-uniform error bounds on
messages, which are tighter than existing ones in literature, and use these
bounds to derive sufficient conditions for the convergence of LBP in terms of
the sum-product algorithm. We subsequently use these bounds to study the

convergence of LBP and sparsity and walk-summability of graphical models. We
finally use the bounds derived to investigate the accuracy of LBP, as well as

distribution closely resembles that of a truly random graph of the same edge
density. Recently, Shapira and Yuster proved the following result on
quasi-randomness of graphs. Let $k \ge 2$ be a fixed integer,
$\alpha_1,...,\alpha_k$ be positive reals satisfying $\sum_{i} \alpha_i = 1$
and $(\alpha_1,..., \alpha_k) \neq (1/k,...,1/k)$, and $G$ be a graph on $n$
vertices. If for every partition of the vertices of $G$ into sets $V_1,...,
V_k$ of size $\alpha_1 n,..., \alpha_k n$, the number of complete graphs on $k$
vertices which have exactly one vertex in each of these sets is similar to what
we would expect in a random graph, then the graph is quasi-random. However, the
method of quasi-random hypergraphs they used did not provide enough information
to resolve the case $(1/k,..., 1/k)$ for graphs. In their work, Shapira and
Yuster asked whether this case also forces the graph to be quasi-random. Janson
also posed the same question in his study of quasi-randomness under the
framework of graph limits. In this paper, we positively answer their question.

to 2454136.6221 (1987 November 16 to 2007 February 5). The observations were
subdivided into 68 data sets consisting of pairs of B and V light curves, which
were then inverted using a constrained non-linear inversion algorithm that
makes no a priori assumptions regarding the number of spots or their shapes.
The resulting surface images were then assigned to 21 groups corresponding to
time intervals over which we could observe the evolution of a given group of
spots (except for three groups consisting of single data sets). Of these 21
groups, six showed convincing evidence of differential rotation over time
intervals of several months. For the others, the spot configuration was such
that differential rotation was neither exhibited nor contraindicated. The
differential rotation we infer is in the same sense as that on the Sun: lower
latitudes have shorter rotation periods. From plots of the range in longitude
spanned by the spotted regions vs. time, we obtain estimates of the
differential rotation coefficient k defined in earlier work by Henry et al.,
and show that our results for its value are consistent with the value obtained
therein.

new insights into perturbative and nonperturbative properties of quantum field
theories. Since hbar is a fundamental parameter, exact Lorentz invariance and
gauge invariance are maintained at each order of the expansion. The physics of
the hbar expansion depends on the scheme; i.e., different expansions are
obtained depending on which quantities (momenta, couplings and masses) are
assumed to be independent of hbar. We show that if the coupling and mass
parameters appearing in the Lagrangian density are taken to be independent of
hbar, then each loop in perturbation theory brings a factor of hbar. In the
case of quantum electrodynamics, this scheme implies that the classical charge
e, as well as the fine structure constant are linear in hbar. The connection
between the number of loops and factors of hbar is more subtle for bound states
since the binding energies and bound-state momenta themselves scale with hbar.
The hbar expansion allows one to identify equal-time relativistic bound states
in QED and QCD which are of lowest order in hbar and transform dynamically
under Lorentz boosts. The possibility to use retarded propagators at the Born
level gives valence-like wave-functions which implicitly describe the sea
constituents of the bound states normally present in its Fock state

current-driven instability of toroidal magnetic fields is considered under the
influence of an axial magnetic field component and under the influence of both
rigid and differential rotation. The MHD equations are solved in a simplified
model with cylindric geometry. We assume the axial field as uniform and the
fluid as incompressible. The stability of a toroidal magnetic field is strongly
influenced by uniform axial magnetic fields. If both field components are of
the same order of magnitude then the instability is slightly supported and
modes with m>1 dominate. If the axial field even dominates the most unstable
modes have again m>1 but the field is strongly stabilized. All modes are
suppressed by a fast rigid rotation where the m=1 mode maximally resists. Just
this mode becomes best re-animated for \Omega > \Omega^A (\Omega^A the Alfven
frequency) if the rotation has a negative shear. -- Strong indication has been
found for a stabilization of the nonaxisymmetric modes for fluids with small
magnetic Prandtl number if they are unstable for Pm=1. For rotating fluids the
higher modes with m>1 do not play an important role in the linear theory. In
the light of our results galactic fields should be marginally unstable against
perturbations with m<= 1. The corresponding growth rates are of the order of
the rotation period of the inner part of the galaxy.

simulations (1) jet propagations through an envelope of a rapidly rotating and
collapsing massive star, which is supposed to be a progenitor of long duration
gamma ray bursts (GRBs), (2) breakouts and subsequent expansions into stellar
winds and (3) accompanying photospheric emissions. We find that if the envelope
rotates uniformly almost at the mass shedding limit, its outer part stops
contracting eventually when the centrifugal force becomes large enough. Then
another shock wave is formed, propagates outwards and breaks out of the
envelope into the stellar wind. Which breaks out earlier, the jet or the
centrifugal bounce-induced shock, depends on the timing of jet injection. If
the shock breakout occurs earlier owing to a later injection, the jet
propagation and subsequent photospheric emissions are affected substantially.
We pay particular attention to observational consequences of the difference in
the timing of jet injection. We calculate optical depths to find the location
of photospheres, extracting densities and temperatures at appropriate retarded
times from the hydrodynamical data. We show that the luminosity and observed
temperature of the photospheric emissions are both much lower than those
reported in previous studies. Although luminosities are still high enough for
GRBs, the observed temperature are lower than the energy at the spectral peak
expected by the Yonetoku-relation. This may imply that energy exchanges between
photons and matter are terminated deeper inside or some non-thermal processes
are operating to boost photon energies.

performed on single crystals of the molecular wheel CsFe$_8$. In this molecule,
eight Fe(III) ions, which are coupled by nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic

angle-dependent EPR data allow for the accurate determination of the spin
Hamiltonian parameters of the lowest spin multiplets with $S \leq$ 4.
Furthermore, the data can well be reproduced by a dimer model with a uniaxial
anisotropy term, with only two free parameters $J$ and $D$. A fit to the dimer
model yields $J$ = -15(2) cm$^{-1}$ and $D$ = -0.3940(8) cm$^{-1}$. A rhombic

at the shortest time scale on which individual orders are placed the tick size
has a major role which affects where limit orders can be placed, the bid-ask

literature on the role of tick size on market microstructure. However, tick
size can also affect price properties at longer time scales, and relatively
less is known about the effect of tick size on the statistical properties of
prices. The present paper is divided in two parts. In the first we review the
effect of tick size change on the market microstructure and the diffusion
properties of prices. The second part presents original results obtained by
investigating the tick size changes occurring at the New York Stock Exchange
(NYSE). We show that tick size change has three effects on price diffusion.
First, as already shown in the literature, tick size affects price return
distribution at an aggregate time scale. Second, reducing the tick size
typically leads to an increase of volatility clustering. We give a possible
mechanistic explanation for this effect, but clearly more investigation is
needed to understand the origin of this relation. Third, we explicitly show
that the ability of the subordination hypothesis in explaining fat tails of
returns and volatility clustering is strongly dependent on tick size. While for
large tick sizes the subordination hypothesis has significant explanatory
power, for small tick sizes we show that subordination is not the main driver
of these two important stylized facts of financial market.

toward the high-mass star-forming region AFGL 5142 in order to study whether
this ratio behaves similarly to the low-mass case, for which the ratio
decreases from starless cores to cores associated with YSOs. CARMA was used to
observe the 3.2 mm continuum and N2H+(1-0) emission. We used NH3(1,1) and
(2,2), HCO+(1-0) and H13CO+(1-0) data from the literature and we performed a
time-dependent chemical modeling of the region. The 3.2 mm continuum emission
reveals a dust condensation of ~23 Msun associated with the massive YSOs,
deeply embedded in the strongest NH3 core (hereafter central core). The N2H+
emission reveals two main cores, the western and eastern core, located to the
west and to the east of the mm condensation, and surrounded by a more extended
and complex structure of ~0.5 pc. Toward the central core the N2H+ emission
drops significantly, indicating a clear chemical differentiation in the region.
We found low values of the NH3/N2H+ ratio ~50-100 toward the western/eastern
cores, and high values up to 1000 in the central core. The chemical model
indicates that density, and in particular temperature, are key parameters in
determining the NH3/N2H+ ratio. The high density and temperature reached in the
central core allow molecules like CO to evaporate from grain mantles. The CO
desorption causes a significant destruction of N2H+, favoring the formation of
HCO+. This result is supported by our observations, which show that N2H+ and
HCO+ are anticorrelated in the central core. The observed values of the
NH3/N2H+ ratio in the central core can be reproduced by our model for times
t~4.5-5.3x10^5 yr (central) and t~10^4-3x10^6 yr (western/eastern). The
NH3/N2H+ ratio in AFGL 5142 does not follow the same trend as in regions of
low-mass star formation mainly due to the high temperature reached in hot
cores.

early stages of high-mass star formation but little is known about their
associations and the physical environments they occur in.
  The aim was to obtain accurate positions and morphologies of the water maser
emission and relate them to the methanol maser emission recently mapped with
Very Long Baseline Interferometry. A sample of 31 methanol maser sources was
searched for 22 GHz water masers using the VLA and observed in the 6.7 GHz
methanol maser line with the 32 m Torun dish simultaneously. Water maser
clusters were detected towards 27 sites finding 15 new sources. The detection
rate of water maser emission associated with methanol sources was as high as
71%. In a large number of objects (18/21) the structure of water maser is well
aligned with that of the extended emission at 4.5 $\mu$m confirming the origin
of water emission from outflows. The sources with methanol emission with
ring-like morphologies, which likely trace a circumstellar disk/torus, either
do not show associated water masers or the distribution of water maser spots is
orthogonal to the major axis of the ring. The two maser species are generally
powered by the same high-mass young stellar object but probe different parts of
its environment. The morphology of water and methanol maser emission in a
minority of sources is consistent with a scenario that 6.7 GHz methanol masers
trace a disc/torus around a protostar while the associated 22 GHz water masers
arise in outflows. The majority of sources in which methanol maser emission is
associated with the water maser appears to trace outflows. The two types of
associations might be related to different evolutionary phases.

temperature has been recently studied by Martin and Ringeval (Phys.\ Rev.\ D

microwave background (CMB) radiation. In this paper, we develop the idea
introduced in this first article to put constraint on the reheating after the
slow-roll inflation. We restrict our considerations to the case of a massive
inflaton field. The method can be, however, easily extended to the different
inflationary scenarios. As a main result, we derive an expression on the
reheating temperature $T_{\text{RH}}$. Surprisingly, the obtained equation is
independent on the unknown number of relativistic degrees of freedom $g_*$
produced during the reheating. Based on this equation and the WMAP 7
observations, we find $T_{\text{RH}}=3.5\cdot 10^6$ GeV, which is consistent
with the current constraints. The relative uncertainty of the result is,
however, very high and equal to $\sigma(T_{\text{RH}})/T_{\text{RH}} \approx
53$. As we show, this uncertainty will be significantly reduced with future CMB
experiments.

single photon can have a strong effect on a single atom in free space.
Regarding this interaction, two conceptually different questions can be asked:
can a single atom fully absorb a single photon and can a single atom fully
reflect a light beam. The conditions for achieving the full effect in either
case are different. Here we discuss related questions in the context of an
optical resonator. When shaping a laser pulse properly it will be fully
absorbed by an optical resonator, i.e., no light will be reflected and all the
pulse energy will accumulate inside the resonator before it starts leaking out.
We show in detail that in this case the temporal pulse shape has to match the
time-reversed pulse obtained by the cavity's free decay. On the other hand a
resonator, made of highly reflecting mirrors which normally reflect a large
portion of any incident light, may fully transmit the light, as long as the
light is narrow band and resonant with the cavity. The analogy is the single
atom - normally letting most of the light pass - which under special conditions
may fully reflect the incident light beam. Using this analogy we are able to
study the effects of practical experimental limitations in the atom-photon
coupling, such as finite pulses, bandwidths, and solid angle coverage, and to
use the optical resonator as a test bed for the implementation of the quantum
experiment.

network overlaid with femtocells, offer an economically appealing way to
improve coverage, quality of service, and access network capacity. The key
element to successful femtocells/macrocell integration lies in its
self-organizing capability. Provisioning of quality of service is the main
technical challenge of the femtocell/macrocell integrated networks, while the
main administrative challenge is the choice of the proper evolutionary path
from the existing macrocellular networks to the integrated network. In this
article, we introduce three integrated network architectures which, while
increasing the access capacity, they also reduce the deployment and operational
costs. Then, we discuss a number of technical issues, which are key to making
such integration a reality, and we offer possible approaches to their solution.
These issues include efficient frequency and interference management, quality
of service provisioning of the xDSL-based backhaul networks, and intelligent
handover control.

quantum wave properties of particles are exploited in metrology using atom

Furthermore, the state-of-the-art time standard is based on an interferometric
technique known as Ramsey spectroscopy. However, the precision of an
interferometer is limited by classical statistics owing to the finite number of
atoms used to deduce the quantity of interest [3]. Here we show experimentally
that the classical precision limit can be surpassed using nonlinear atom
interferometry with a Bose-Einstein condensate. Controlled interactions between
the atoms lead to non-classical entangled states within the interferometer;
this represents an alternative approach to the use of non-classical input
states [4-8]. Extending quantum interferometry [9] to the regime of large atom
number, we find that phase sensitivity is enhanced by 15 per cent relative to
that in an ideal classical measurement. Our nonlinear atomic beam splitter
follows the ""one-axis-twisting"" scheme [10] and implements interaction control
using a narrow Feshbach resonance. We perform noise tomography of the quantum
state within the interferometer and detect coherent spin squeezing with a
squeezing factor of -8.2dB [11-15]. The results provide information on the
many-particle quantum state, and imply the entanglement of 170 atoms [16].

learns routing information by overhearing or forwarding packets to other nodes
and keep learned routes in its route cache. However, node movement results
broken links and therefore increases risk of cache pollution. Ensuring cache
freshness in on-demand routing protocols, therefore, presents a serious
challenge. A lot of research has been done in route cache organization,
however, little effort has been done for route cache timeout policy to prevent
stale routes from being used. In this paper we propose a new cross-layer

The proposed framework presents novel use of Received Signal Strength Indicator

main aim has been to study the outburst mechanism on the basis of a follow-up
of the photometric variations associated with the release of dust. We used a
standardized method to obtain the 10 arc-sec nucleus photometry in the V, R,
and I filters of the Johnson-Kron-Cousins system, being accurately calibrated
with standard Landolt stars. Production of dust in the R and I bands during the
2010 Feb. 3 outburst has been also computed. We conclude that the massive
ejection of large (optically-thin) particles from the surface at the time of
the outburst is the triggering mechanism to produce the outburst. Ulterior
sublimation of these ice-rich dust particles during the following days induces
fragmentation, generating micrometer-sized grains that increase the dust
spatial density to produce the outburst in the optical range due to scattering
of sun light. The material leaving the nucleus adopts a fan-like dust feature,
formed by micrometer-sized particles that are decaying in brightness as it
evolved outwards. By analyzing the photometric signal measured in a
standardized 10-arcsec aperture using the Phase Dispersion Minimization
technique we have found a clear periodicity of 50 days. Remarkably, this value
is also consistent with an outburst frequency of 7.4 outbursts/year deduced
from the number of outbursts noticed during the effective observing time.

predictions for the capacities of one of Gaia's pixel features, the

measured the SBC capacities of a Gaia CCD to be an order of magnitude smaller
than e2v's design. We have found the SBC doping widths that yield these
measured SBC capacities. The widths are systematically 2 {\mu}m offset to the
nominal widths. These offsets appear to be uncalibrated systematic offsets in
e2v photolithography, which could either be due to systematic stitch alignment
offsets or lateral ABD shield doping diffusion. The range of SBC capacities
were used to derive the worst-case random stitch error between two pixel
features within a stitch block to be \pm 0.25 {\mu}m, which cannot explain the
systematic offsets. It is beyond the scope of our pixel model to provide the
manufacturing reason for the range of SBC capacities, so it does not allow us
to predict how representative the tested CCD is. This open question has
implications for Gaia's radiation damage and geometric calibration models.

efficiency in building planetesimals and planetary cores, and dust observed
around young T Tauri and Herbig Ae stars can be used as a proxy for this
initial solid content. The dust-mass distributions are taken from recent
millimetre-wavelength data and fitted using survival analysis to take into
account upper limits, and threshold disc-masses for building planets and belts
of comets are estimated. Amongst A-stars, 20% gas giant and 55% debris disc
systems are predicted, in good agreement with observations. For M-stars, the
predicted and observed planet-frequencies agree at ~2-3%, and this low
incidence is explained by a lack of massive discs. However, debris is predicted
around approx. 14% of M-stars, while only ~2% such systems have so far been
found. This suggests that deeper searches such as with Herschel and SCUBA-2 may
find a cold disc population previously missed around these low-luminosity
stars. Also, an estimate of the efficiency of building millimetre-detected dust
into planetary cores suggests that about a third of M-stars could host an
Earth-mass planet -- but as the dust is spread over large disc areas, such
planets may orbit far from the star.

techniques to measure piconewton and femtonewton forces at microscopic and

ineluctable thermal noise, which, in the typical experimental situation of a
spatial diffusion gradient, causes a spurious drift. This leads to a correction
term when forces are estimated from drift measurements [Phys. Rev. Lett. 104,
170602 (2010)]. Here, we provide a systematic study of such effect comparing
the forces acting on various Brownian particles derived from equilibrium
distribution and drift measurements. We discuss the physical origin of the
correction term, its dependence on wall distance, particle radius, and its
relation to the convention used to solve the respective stochastic integrals.
Such correction term becomes more significant for smaller particles and is
predicted to be in the order of several piconewtons for particles the size of a

compare the recession velocities of the host and satellite. This test confirms,
in all cases, that there is genuine line emission, that the detected line is

to capture the intimate relation between finite tunneling and reflection and
bath induced quantum fluctuations. From the corresponding steady state

obtained. It is shown that a reduction of the transition rate due to finite
reflection at the phase-space barrier is overcompensated by an increase due to
environmental quantum fluctuations that are specific for diffusion processes
over dynamical barriers. Moreover, it is revealed that close to the bifurcation
threshold the escape dynamics enters an overdamped domain such that the quantum

about biholomorphic inequivalence of $ \mathbf{B}^n $, the unit ball in $
\mathbf{C}^n $ and $ \Delta^n $, the unit polydisc in $ \mathbf{C}^n $ and then
provide few examples which \textit{suggest} that $ \mathbf{B}^n $ cannot be
mapped isometrically onto a product domain. In addition, we prove several
results on continuous extension of isometries $ f : D_1 \rightarrow D_2 $ to
the closures under purely local assumptions on the boundaries. As an
application, we show that there is no isometry between a strongly pseudoconvex
domain in $ \mathbf{C}^2 $ and certain classes of weakly pseudoconvex finite
type domains in $ \mathbf{C}^2 $.

[(6,3)+(3,6)], [(3,3_bar)+(3_bar,3)], [(8,1)+(1,8)] and their ""mirror"" images,
Ref.[9]. It has been shown (phenomenologically) in Ref.[3] that mixing of the
[(6,3)+(3,6)] chiral multiplet with one ordinary (""naive"") and one ""mirror""
field belonging to the [(3,3_bar)+(3_bar,3)], [(8,1)+(1,8)] multiplets can be
used to fit the values of the isovector (g_A^3) and the flavor-singlet
(isoscalar) axial coupling (g_A^0) of the nucleon and then predict the axial F
and D coefficients, or vice versa, in reasonable agreement with experiment. In
an attempt to derive such mixing from an effective Lagrangian, we construct all
SU_L(3)*SU_R(3) chirally invariant non-derivative one-meson-baryon interactions
and then calculate the mixing angles in terms of baryons' masses. It turns out
that there are (strong) selection rules: for example, there is only one
non-derivative chirally symmetric interaction between J=1/2 fields belonging to
the [(6,3)+(3,6)] and the [(3,3_bar)+(3_bar,3)] chiral multiplets, that is also
U_A(1) symmetric. We also study the chiral interactions of the
[(3,3_bar)+(3_bar,3)] and [(8,1)+(1,8)] nucleon fields. Again, there are
selection rules that allow only one off-diagonal non-derivative chiral
SU_L(3)*SU_R(3) interaction of this type, that also explicitly breaks the
U_A(1) symmetry. We use this interaction to calculate the corresponding mixing
angles in terms of baryon masses and fit two lowest lying observed nucleon
(resonance) masses, thus predicting the third (J=1/2, I=3/2) Delta resonance,
as well as one or two flavor-singlet Lambda hyperon(s), depending on the type
of mixing. The effective chiral Lagrangians derived here may be applied to high
density matter calculations.

conducting structures defined at an otherwise insulating LaAlO3/SrTiO3

However, a finite resistance remains even at the lowest temperature. At higher
magnetic fields, interfaces with high mobility also exhibit strong Shubnikov-de
Haas oscillations as well as a larger Ginsburg-Landau coherence length. Cooper
pair localization, spin-orbit coupling, and finite-size effects may factor into
an explanation for some of the unusual properties observed.

later, C.G. Phipps formulated a more general solution. He formulated a
so-called convoy or caravan variant of the jeep problem and reduced the
original problem to it. We shall refine the convoy idea of Phipps and
subsequently view a more general jeep problem, which we solve for jeep convoys
as well as for a single jeep. In the last section we solve Maddex' jeep
problem.

"1009.2989","Allan Din","Allan M. Din","Analysis of Riemann Zeta-Function Zeros using Pochhammer Polynomial
  Expansions",,,,,"math.GM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Riemann Xi-function Xi(t) belongs to a family of entire functions which
can be expanded in a uniformly convergent series of symmetrized Pochhammer
polynomials depending on a real scaling parameter beta. It can be shown that
the polynomial approximant Xi(n,t,beta) to Xi(t) has distinct real roots only
in the asymptotic scaling limit beta->infinity. One may therefore infer the
existence of increasing beta-sequences beta(n)->infinity for n->infinity, such
that Xi(n,t,beta(n)) has real roots only for all n, and to each entire function
it is possible to associate a unique minimal beta-sequence fulfilling a
specific difference equation.
  Numerical analysis indicates that the minimal beta(n) sequence associated
with the Riemann Xi(t) has a distinct sub-logarithmic growth rate, and it can
be shown that the approximant Xi(n,t,beta(n)) converges to Xi(t) when
n->infinity if beta(n)=o(log (n)). Invoking the Hurwitz theorem of complex
analysis, and applying a formal analysis of the asymptotic properties of
minimal beta-sequences, a fundamental mechanism is identified which provides a
compelling confirmation of the validity of the Riemann Hypothesis.

simultaneous observations in the 12CO(J = 2-1) and 13CO(J = 2-1) lines over the
Galactic plane l = 10-245 deg along b = 0 deg with a 3.75 arcmin grid. Using
the 12CO(J = 1-0) data of Dame et al. (2001), who used a beam size almost the
same as ours, we show 12CO(J = 2-1)/12CO(J = 1-0) and 13CO(J = 2-1)/12CO(J =
2-1) intensity ratios on the l-v map and the intensity correlations among the
three lines. As a result, a linear correlation between 12CO(J = 1-0) and 12CO(J
= 2-1) and a curve correlation between 12CO(J = 2-1) and 13CO(J = 2-1), as
produced by most of the data, are found. We investigate these correlations with
simple radiative transfer equations to ascertain a number of restrictions on
the physical quantities of molecular gas on a galactic scale.
