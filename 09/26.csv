Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) imaging. Aims: We almost double the number of
VLBI-imaged quasars at these high redshifts with the aim of studying their
redshift-dependent structural and physical properties in a larger sample.
Methods: We observed five radio quasars (J0813+3508, J1146+4037, J1242+5422,
J1611+0844, and J1659+2101) at 4.5<z<5 with the European VLBI Network (EVN) at
1.6 GHz on 29 October 2008 and at 5 GHz on 22 October 2008. The angular
resolution achieved ranges from 1.5 to 25 milli-arcseconds (mas), depending on
the observing frequency, the position angle in the sky, and the source's
celestial position. Results: The sources are all somewhat extended on mas
scales, but compact enough to be detected at both frequencies. With one
exception of a flat-spectrum source (J1611+0844), their compact emission is
characterised by a steep radio spectrum. We found no evidence of
Doppler-boosted radio emission in the quasars in our sample. The radio
structure of one of them (J0813+3508) is extended to ~7"", which corresponds to
43 kpc projected linear size. Many of the highest redshift compact radio
sources are likely to be young, evolving objects, far-away cousins of the
powerful gigahertz peaked-spectrum (GPS) and compact steep-spectrum (CSS)
sources that populate the Universe at lower redshifts.

Getzler and Jones, to operads of spectra in the sense of stable homotopy
theory. Our main result is the existence of a Quillen equivalence between the
category of reduced operads of spectra (with the projective model structure)
and a new model for the homotopy theory of cooperads of spectra. The crucial
construction is of a weak equivalence of operads between the Boardman-Vogt
W-construction for an operad P, and the cobar-bar construction on P. This weak
equivalence generalizes a theorem of Berger and Moerdijk that says the W- and
cobar-bar constructions are isomorphic for operads of chain complexes. Our
model for the homotopy theory of cooperads is based on `pre-cooperads'. These
can be viewed as cooperads in which the structure maps are zigzags of maps of
spectra that satisfy coherence conditions. Our model structure on pre-cooperads
is such that every object is weakly equivalent to an actual cooperad, and weak
equivalences between cooperads are detected in the underlying symmetric
sequences. We also interpret our results in terms of a `derived Koszul dual'
for operads of spectra, which is analogous to the Ginzburg-Kapranov dg-dual. We
show that the `double derived Koszul dual' of an operad P is equivalent to P
(under some finiteness hypotheses) and that the derived Koszul construction
preserves homotopy colimits, finite homotopy limits and derived mapping spaces
for operads.

reason of which is still controversial. The BLRs in AGNs are believed to be
associated with the outflows from the accretion disks. Most of the
low-luminosity AGNs (LLAGNs) contain advection dominated accretion flows
(ADAFs), which are very hot and have a positive Bernoulli parameter. ADAFs are
therefore associated with strong outflows. We estimate the cooling of the
outflows from the ADAFs, and find that the gases in such hot outflows always
cannot be cooled efficiently by bremsstrahlung radiation. The ADAF may co-exist
with the standard disk, i.e., the inner ADAF connects to the outer thin
accretion disk at radius R_tr, in the sources accreting at slightly lower than
the critical rate. For the ADAFs with >0.001 L_edd, a secondary small inner
cold disk is suggested to co-exist with the ADAF due to the condensation
process. We estimate the Compton cooling of the outflow, of which the soft seed
photons either come from the outer cold disk or the secondary inner cold disk.
It is found that the gas in the outflow far from the ADAF may be efficiently
cooled to form BLR clouds due to the soft seed photons emitted from the cold
disks, provided the transition radius of the ADAF to the outer cold disk is
small or/and the secondary small cold disk has a luminosity >0.003L_edd. The
BLR clouds can still be formed in the outflows from the outer cold thin disks,
if the transition radius is not very large. For the sources with <0.001L_edd,
the inner small cold disk is evaporated completely in the ADAF and outer thin
accretion disk may be suppressed by the ADAF, which leads to the disappearance
of the BLR. The physical implications of this scenario on the double-peaked
broad-line emitters are also discussed.

the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (FGST) has detected 320 Gamma-Ray Bursts
(GRBs). About 20% of these events are classified as short based on their T90
duration below 2 s. We present here for the first time time-resolved
spectroscopy at timescales as short as 2 ms for the three brightest short GRBs
observed with GBM. The time-integrated spectra of the events deviate from the
Band function, indicating the existence of an additional spectral component,
which can be fit by a power-law with index ~-1.5. The time-integrated Epeak
values exceed 2 MeV for two of the bursts, and are well above the values
observed in the brightest long GRBs. Their Epeak values and their low-energy
power-law indices ({\alpha}) confirm that short GRBs are harder than long ones.
We find that short GRBs are very similar to long ones, but with light curves
contracted in time and with harder spectra stretched towards higher energies.
In our time-resolved spectroscopy analysis, we find that the Epeak values range
from a few tens of keV up to more than 6 MeV. In general, the hardness
evolutions during the bursts follows their flux/intensity variations, similar
to long bursts. However, we do not always see the Epeak leading the light-curve
rises, and we confirm the zero/short average light-curve spectral lag below 1
MeV, already established for short GRBs. We also find that the time-resolved
low-energy power-law indices of the Band function mostly violate the limits
imposed by the synchrotron models for both slow and fast electron cooling and
may require additional emission processes to explain the data. Finally, we
interpreted these observations in the context of the current existing models
and emission mechanisms for the prompt emission of GRBs.

was recently shown that under surprisingly broad conditions, the Robust PCA

combination of the nuclear norm and the $\ell^1$-norm . In this paper, we apply
the method of augmented Lagrange multipliers (ALM) to solve this convex

classical analysis of ALM to such new objective functions and prove the
optimality of the proposed algorithms and characterize their convergence rate.
Empirically, the proposed new algorithms can be more than five times faster
than the previous state-of-the-art algorithms for Robust PCA, such as the
accelerated proximal gradient (APG) algorithm. Moreover, the new algorithms
achieve higher precision, yet being less storage/memory demanding. We also show
that the ALM technique can be used to solve the (related but somewhat simpler)

prove the necessary and sufficient condition for the inexact ALM to converge

the ice was asymmetrically distributed around the present North Pole. It
reached the region of New York, while east Siberia remained ice free. Mammoths

this hypothesis is that the phenomena should be reported in old traditions.
This paper quotes such traditions from passages of Platon, Herodotus, Ovid,

probing primordial non-Gaussianity. In this study we focus on understanding the
matter clustering at several redshifts. The primordial non-Gaussianity is
modeled as a quadratic correction to the local Gaussian potential, and is
characterized by the parameter f_NL. In our formulation of the halo model we
pay special attention to the effect of halo exclusion, and show that this can
potentially solve the long standing problem of excess power on large scales in
this model. The model depends on the mass function, clustering and density
profiles of halos. We test these ingredients using a large ensemble of
high-resolution Gaussian and non-Gaussian numerical simulations. In particular,
we provide a first exploration of how density profiles change in the presence
of primordial non-Gaussianities. We find that for f_NL positive/negative high
mass halos have an increased/decreased core density, so being more/less
concentrated than in the Gaussian case. We also examine the halo bias and show
that, if the halo model is correct, then there is a small asymmetry in the
scale-dependence of the bias on very large scales, which arises because the
Gaussian bias must be renormalized. We show that the matter power spectrum is
modified by ~2.5% and ~3.5% on scales k~1.0 h/Mpc at z=0 and z=1, respectively.
Our halo model calculation reproduces the absolute amplitude to within 10% and
the ratio of non-Gaussian to Gaussian spectra to within 1%. We also measure the
matter correlation functions and find similarly good agreement between the
model and the data. We anticipate that this modeling will be useful for
constraining f_NL from measurements of the shear correlation function in future
weak lensing surveys such as Euclid.

an exact continuous chiral symmetry is dynamically broken and thus there are
massless Goldstone excitons. If the Dirac fermions have a small bare mass, an

Goldstone type excitons become massive, which is analogous to what happens in

Coulomb interaction strength for excitonic pair formation and a strong
enhancement of dynamical fermion mass. We then calculate the masses of

topological field theories, like 2d Yang-Mills, 3d gravity or BF theories.
Different models have also been proposed for 4-dimensional quantum gravity. In
this PhD manuscript, I discuss several methods to study spin foam models. In
particular, I present some recurrence relations on spin foam amplitudes, which
generically encode classical symmetries at the quantum level, and are likely to
help fill the gap with the Hamiltonian constraints. These relations can be
naturally interpreted in terms of elementary deformations of discrete geometric
structures, like simplicial geometries. Another interesting method consists in
exploring the way spin foam models can be written as path integrals for systems
of geometries on a lattice, taking inspiration from topological models and
Regge calculus. This leads to a very geometric view on spin foams, and gives
classical action principles which are studied in details.

few-cycle pulse which has a phase jump $\phi$ at $t=t_{0}$, in contrast to many
cycle pulses, under non rotating-wave approximation (NRWA). We give a closed
form analytical solution for the evolution of the probability amplitude $|C_{a}
(t)|$ for the upper level. Using the appropriate pulse parameters like
phase-jump $\phi$, jump time $t_{0}$, pulse width $\tau$, frequency $\nu$ and
Rabi frequency $\Omega_{0}$ the population transfer, after the pulse is gone,
can be optimized and for the pulse considered here, enhancement of
$10^{6}-10^{8}$ factor was obtained.
