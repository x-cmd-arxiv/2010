learn classifiers that optimize domain specific performance measures.
Previously, the research has focused on learning the needed classifier in
isolation, yet learning nonlinear classifier for nonlinear and nonsmooth
performance measures is still hard. In this paper, rather than learning the
needed classifier by optimizing specific performance measure directly, we
circumvent this problem by proposing a novel two-step approach called as CAPO,
namely to first train nonlinear auxiliary classifiers with existing learning
methods, and then to adapt auxiliary classifiers for specific performance
measures. In the first step, auxiliary classifiers can be obtained efficiently
by taking off-the-shelf learning algorithms. For the second step, we show that
the classifier adaptation problem can be reduced to a quadratic program
problem, which is similar to linear SVMperf and can be efficiently solved. By
exploiting nonlinear auxiliary classifiers, CAPO can generate nonlinear
classifier which optimizes a large variety of performance measures including
all the performance measure based on the contingency table and AUC, whilst
keeping high computational efficiency. Empirical studies show that CAPO is
effective and of high computational efficiency, and even it is more efficient
than linear SVMperf.

Array (ATA) to present a novel analysis of their Faraday rotation properties.
Each source was observed during the commissioning phase with 2 to 4 100-MHz
bands at frequencies ranging from 1 to 2 GHz. These observations demonstrate
how the continuous frequency coverage of the ATA's log-periodic receiver can be
applied to the study of Faraday rotation measures (RMs). We use RM synthesis to
show that wide-bandwidth data can find multiple RM components toward a single
source. Roughly a quarter of the sources studied have extra RM components with
high confidence (brighter than ~40 mJy), when observing with a RM resolution of
roughly 100 rad/m2. These extra components contribute 10%-70% of the total
polarized flux. This is the first time multiple RM components have been
identified in a large sample of point sources. For our observing configuration,
these extra RM components bias the measurement of the peak RM by 10-15 rad/m2 ;
more generally, the peak RM cannot be determined more precisely than the RM
beam size. Comparing our 1-2 GHz RM spectra to VLBA polarimetric maps shows
both techniques can identify complicated Faraday structures in the sources.
However, the RM values and fractional polarization are generally smaller at
lower frequencies than in the higher-frequency VLBA maps. With a few
exceptions, the RMs from this work are consistent with that of earlier,
narrow-bandwidth, all-sky surveys. This work also describes the polarimetry
calibration procedure and that on-axis ATA observations of linear polarization
can be calibrated to an accuracy of 0.2% of Stokes I. Future research
directions include studying the time-dependent RM structure in Active Galactic
Nuclei (AGNs) and enabling accurate, wide-area RM surveys to test models of

However, it's unclear what ""mind"" is, or how the special features of neocortex

intelligence1 is learning relationships between large numbers of signals (such
as pixel values), rather than memorizing explicit patterns. Causes (such as
objects) can then be inferred from a learned internal model. These
relationships fall into 2 classes: simple pairwise or second-order correlations
(socs), and complex, and vastly more numerous, higher-order correlations
(hocsB), such as the product of 3 or more pixels averaged over a set of images.
Thus if 3 pixels correlate, they may give an ""edge"". Neurons with ""Hebbian""
synapses (changing strength in response to input-output spike-coincidences) are
sensitive to such correlations, and it's likely that learned internal models
use such neurons. Because output firing depends on input firing via the
relevant connection strengths, Hebbian learning provides, in a feedback manner,
sensitivity to input correlations. Hocs are vital, since they express
""interesting"" structure2 (e.g. edges), but their detection requires nonlinear
rules operating at synapses of individual neurons. Here we report that in
single model neurons learning from hocs fails, and defaults to socs, if
nonlinear Hebbian rules are not sufficiently connection-specific. Such failure
would inevitably occur if a neuron's input synapses were too crowded, and would
undermine biological connectionism. Since the cortex must be hoc-sensitive to
achieve the type of learning enabling mind, we propose it uses known, detailed
but poorly understood circuitry and physiology to ""proofread"" Hebbian
connections. Analogous DNA proofreading allows evolution of complex genomes
(i.e. ""life"").

decoders to recover the original signal, compressed by source coding have high
complexity, the compressive sensing decoder is a linear or convex optimization.
First, we investigate applications of compressive sensing on distributed
compression of correlated sources. Here, by using compressive sensing, we
propose a compression scheme for a family of correlated sources with a
modularized decoder, providing a trade-off between the compression rate and the
decoding complexity. We call this scheme Sparse Distributed Compression. We use
this compression scheme for a general multicast network with correlated
sources. Here, we first decode some of the sources by a network decoding
technique and then, we use a compressive sensing decoder to obtain the whole
sources. Then, we investigate applications of compressive sensing on channel
coding. We propose a coding scheme that combines compressive sensing and random
channel coding for a high-SNR point-to-point Gaussian channel. We call this
scheme Sparse Channel Coding. We propose a modularized decoder providing a
trade-off between the capacity loss and the decoding complexity. At the

Infrared dark clouds (IRDCs), with their low temperatures and high densities,
have been identified as the potential birthplaces of massive stars. In order to
understand the formation processes of massive stars the physical and chemical
conditions in infrared dark clouds have to be characterized. The goal of this
paper is to investigate the chemical composition of a sample of southern
infrared dark clouds. One important aspect of the observations is to check, if
the molecular abuncances in IRDCs are similar to the low-mass pre-stellar
cores, or whether they show signatures of more evolved evolutionary stages. We
performed observations toward 15 IRDCs in the frequency range between 86 and 93
GHz using the 22-m Mopra radio telescope. We detect HNC, HCO$^+$ and HNC
emission in all clouds and N$_2$H$^+$ in all IRDCs except one. In some clouds
we detect SiO emission. Complicated shapes of the HCO$^+$ emission line profile
are found in all IRDCs. Both signatures indicates the presence of infall and
outflow motions and beginning of star formation activity, at least in some
parts of the IRDCs. Where possible, we calculate molecular abundances and make
a comparison with previously obtained values for low-mass pre-stellar cores and
high-mass protostellar objects (HMPOs). We show a tendency for IRDCs to have
molecular abundances similar to low-mass pre-stellar cores rather than to HMPOs
abundances on the scale of our single-dish observations.

First, the sensitivity of the novel sensor was tested using densities of rigid

known densities was established, the sensor was used to measure several sites
located in the proximal femur of ten human cadaveric specimens. The accuracy of

indicate not only that the novel technique is capable of detecting differences

SiO$_2$ substrate by means of the microscopic kinetic spin Bloch equation
approach. The substrate causes a strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling field $\sim
0.15$ meV, which might be accounted for by the impurities initially present in
the substrate or even the substrate-induced structure distortion. By surface
chemical doping with Au atoms, this Rashba spin-orbit coupling is further
strengthened as the adatoms can distort the graphene lattice from $sp^2$ to
$sp^3$ bonding structure. By fitting the Au doping dependence of spin
relaxation from Pi {\sl et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 104}, 187201 (2010)],
the Rashba spin-orbit coupling coefficient is found to increase approximately
linearly from 0.15 to 0.23 meV with the increase of Au density. With this
strong spin-orbit coupling, the spin diffusion or transport length is
comparable with the experimental values. In the strong scattering limit
(dominated by the electron-impurity scattering in our study), the spin
diffusion is uniquely determined by the Rashba spin-orbit coupling strength and
insensitive to the temperature, electron density as well as scattering. With
the presence of an electric field along the spin injection direction, the spin
transport length can be modulated by either the electric field or the electron
density. (The remaining is omitted due to the limit of space)

Finder or Exoplanet Probe, light from the exozodiacal dust tends to obscure any
exoplanets present in the image. Data analysis methods to identify point
sources against this background have been very simple, traditionally with the
simplifying assumption that the exozodi is uniformly distributed, just as our
local zodiacal background is uniform over several-arcsec scales. However, the
typical size of an exozodi cloud is expected to be comparable to the typical
exoplanet orbital radii, or at least those of greatest interest_ the ""habitable
zone"" range from 0.7-1.5 AU. When a direct detection instrument is reduced in
size for cost reasons, the point spread function (PSF) becomes broader, making
it more difficult to distinguish a point source from a ""blob"" of exozodi light.
In this case, the shot-noise limited integration time may not be enough;
instead we may need an elevated signal-to-noise ratio and/or later measurements
to resolve ambiguities in the image data, identify a point source with a
calculable and high confidence level, and isolate the exozodi and exoplanet
contributions to the observed light profile. We will examine some typical
profiles and a few methods of analyzing image data, with the goal of

apply these results to the data augmentation (DA) procedure for independent and
identically distributed observations. More precisely, we show that if both the
sample size and the running time of the DA procedure tend to infinity the
empirical distribution of the DA procedure tends to the posterior distribution.
This is a local property of the DA procedure, which may be, in some cases, more
helpful than the global properties to describe its behavior. The advantages of
using the local properties are the simplicity and the generality of the
results. The local properties provide useful insight into the problem of how to
construct efficient algorithms.

demonstrate that such birefringence isotherms, when performed simultaneously

condensates are almost bulk-like, optically isotropic liquids. For both
anisotropic species we find, however, a weak orientational order (of a few
percent at maximum) upon film-condensation in the monolithic mesoporous

only, and vanishes gradually upon onset of capillary condensation. Presumably,
it originates in the breaking of the full rotational symmetry of the
interaction potential at the cylindrical, free liquid-vapor interface in the
film-condensed state rather than at the silica-liquid interface. This
conclusion is corroborated by comparisons of our experimental results with
molecular dynamics simulations reported in the literature.

At low continuum fluxes an emission line spectrum is well defined with both
narrow and broad components of several abundant metal ions. The absorption line
velocity structure and a broad correlation of velocity and ionization parameter
are consistent with an outflow scenario where a highly ionized, high velocity
wind, perhaps launched during intermittent super-Eddington accretion, runs into
the interstellar medium or previous ejecta, losing much of its kinetic energy
in the resultant strong shock. We explore the possibility that a quasi-constant
soft X-ray emission component may be evidence of this post-shock cooling. This
revised view of AGN outflows is consistent with multiple minor Eddington
accretion episodes creating a momentum-driven feedback linking black hole and
host galaxy growth.

geometrical center of a pair of sources on the resolution of the double-image.
Both properties are found to be sensitive to the displacement, which implies
that a PhC slab cannot be treated seriously as a flat lens. We also show that
by introducing material absorption into the dielectric cylinders of the PhC

problem specialized to the case where $N$ vortices have small and equal
circulation and one vortex has large circulation. As the small circulation
tends to zero, the weak vortices tend to a circle centered on the strong
vortex. A special potential function of this limiting problem can be used to
characterize orbits and stability. Whenever a critical point of this function
is nondegenerate, we prove that the orbit can be continued, and its linear
stability is determined by properties of the potential. For $N\geq 3$ there are
at least three distinct families of critical points associated to the limiting
problem. Assuming nondegeneracy, one of these families continues to a linearly
stable class of relative equilibria with small and large circulation of the
same sign. This class becomes unstable as the small circulation passes through
zero and changes sign. Another family of critical points which is always
nondegenerate continues to a configuration with small vortices arranged in an
$N$-gon about the strong central vortex. This class of relative equilibria is
linearly unstable regardless of the sign of the small circulation when $N\geq
4$. Numerical results suggest that the third family of critical points of the
limiting problem also continues to a linearly unstable class of solutions of
the full problem independent of the sign of the small circulation. Thus there
is evidence that linearly stable relative equilibria exist when the large and
small circulation strengths are of the same sign, but that no such solutions
exist when they have opposite signs. The results of this paper are in contrast
to those of the analogous celestial mechanics problem, for which the $N$-gon is
the only relative equilibrium for $N$ sufficiently large, and is linearly
stable if and only if $N\geq 7$.

of this work is to strengthen the validity of the statistical-mechanical
approach we have proposed previously to explain the dark matter halo
properties. By introducing an effective pressure instead of the radial pressure
to construct the specific entropy, we use the entropy principle and proceed in
a similar way as previously to obtain an entropy stationary equation. An
equation of state for equilibrated dark halos is derived from this entropy
stationary equation, by which the dark halo density profiles with finite mass
can be obtained. We also derive the anisotropy parameter and pseudo-phase-space
density profile. All these predictions agree well with numerical simulations in
the outer regions of dark halos. Our work provides further support to the idea
that statistical mechanics for self-gravitating systems is a viable tool for
investigation.
