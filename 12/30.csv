for the central experiment of measuring the stray differential acceleration

overall acceleration noise to within a factor two of the LISA requirement at 1
mHz and within a factor 6 at 0.1 mHz. We also discuss the key elements of the

backscattering that is alternative to the well known Lundstrom model and is

Our model differs from the Lundstrom model in two assumptions: i) the
reflection coefficients from the top of the energy barrier to the drain and
from top of the barrier to the source are approximately equal (whereas in the
Lundstrom model the latter is zero), and ii) inelastic scattering is assumed
through a ratio of the average velocity of forward-going carriers to that of
backward-going carriers at the top of the barrier kv > 1 (=1 in the Lundstrom
model). We support our assumptions with 2D full band Monte Carlo (MC)
simulations including quantum corrections in nMOSFETs. We show that our model
allows to extract from the electrical characteristics a backscattering
coefficient very close to that obtained from the solution of the Boltzmann
transport equation, whereas the Lundstrom model overestimates backscattering by

knowledge of the barrier lowering at the operative bias point in the inversion
regime is of fundamental importance in device scaling. At the same time we
obtain also an estimate of the backscattering ratio and of the saturation
inversion charge. Respect to previously reported works on extraction of
transport parameters based on the Lundstrom model, our extraction method is
fully consistent with it, whereas other methods make a number of approximations
in the calculation of the saturation inversion charge which are inconsistent
with the model. The proposed experimental extraction method has been validated
and applied to results from device simulation and measurements on short-channel
poly-Si/SiON gate nMOSFETs with gate length down to 70 nm. Moreover we propose
an extension of the backscattering model to the case of 2D geometries (e.g.
bulk MOSFETs). We found that, in this case, the backscattering is governed by
the carrier transport in a few nanometers close to the silicon/oxide interface
and that the value of the backscattering ratio obtained with a 1D approach can
be significantly different from the real 2D value.

that the CV based method uses a number of approximations which are partially

used to calculate the electromagnetic field distribution. It is found that the
periodic modulation provides an effective way to control the Spontaneous
Emission under certain circumstances. We find the conditions where a large
amount of light can be enhanced on the vicinity of a photonic band edge due to
the presence of a high density of states.
  This phenomena opens the possibility to design new Lasers sources.

analyzing the dynamics of complex networks in which the network of interest is
first abstracted to a much simpler, but mathematically equivalent,

analytic conclusions are then mapped back to the original network and
interpreted there. We begin by identifying a broad and important class of
complex networks which admit vulnerability-preserving, finite state

abstractions. We then propose a vulnerability analysis methodology which
combines these finite state abstractions with formal analytics from theoretical
computer science to yield a comprehensive vulnerability analysis process for
networks of realworld scale and complexity. The potential of the proposed

implications for a consistent description of the multiverse. In particular, we
elaborate on the recent observation by Maldacena, that the interior of AdS
bubbles can be described in terms of CFT degrees of freedom living on the
worldsheet of the bubble wall. We consider the scattering of bulk gravitons in
the ambient parent vacuum, off the bubble wall. In the dual description, the
transmission coefficient is interpreted as the probability that a graviton is
absorbed by the worldsheet CFT degrees of freedom. The result is in agreement
with intuitive expectations. Conformal invariance is not exact in this setup,
and the leading corrections due to the IR and UV cut-offs are displayed. Aside
from bulk scattering states, we find that when a bubble nucleates within a
parent dS vacuum, there is a zero mode of the graviton which describes lower
dimensional gravity with a finite Newton's constant. This massless graviton
lives within one Hubble radius away from the bubble wall. Possible implications
for a fully holographic description of the inflating multiverse are briefly
discussed.

proposed for multipath adaptive traffic engineering between an ingress node
(source) and an egress node (destination) to distribute the network flow among
multiple disjoint paths. Its novel idea is to avoid network congestion and
attacks that might exist in edge and node disjoint paths between two core
network nodes.
  This paper proposes protection schemes over asymmetric channels. Precisely,
the paper aims to develop an adaptive, robust, and reliable traffic engineering
scheme to improve performance and reliability of communication networks. This
scheme will also provision Quality of Server (QoS) and protection of traffic
engineering to maximize network efficiency. Specifically, S-MATE (secure MATE)
is proposed to protect the network traffic between two core nodes (routers,
switches, etc.) in a cloud network. S-MATE secures against a single link
attack/failure by adding redundancy in one of the operational redundant paths
between the sender and receiver nodes. It is also extended to secure against
multiple attacked links. The proposed scheme can be applied to secure core
networks such as optical and IP networks.

indexed by a simplicial set. We develop a method to construct family hypercover
refinements of a cover family based on the notion of \emph{n-spans} that we
introduce here. In [The fundamental progroupoid of a general topos, Journal of
Pure and Applied Algebra 212 (2008)] we had introduced the notion of
\emph{covering projection} in a topos. They are locally constant objects
satisfying an additional condition which is valid in all locally constant
objects when the topos is locally connected, and developed the theory of the
fundamental groupoid of a general topos. Here we show that covering projections
can be obtained as objects constructed from a descent datum of a simplicial set
on a family of sets. We construct a groupoid $\nn{G}_\cc{H}$ such that the
category $\cc{G}_\cc{H}$ of covering projections trivialized by $\cc{H}$ is its
classifying topos. This determines a protopos $\{\cc{G} \cc{H}\}_\cc{H}$ and a
progroupoid $\{\nn{G}_\cc{H}\}_\cc{H}$, suitable indexed by a filtered poset of
hypercovers. Then we show that this progroupoid classifies torsors. This
construction is novel also in the case of locally connected topoi, showing that
locally constant object in a locally connected topos are constructed by descent
from a descent datum on a family of sets. The salient feature that
distinguishes locally connected topoi is that the progroupoid is \emph{strict},
that is, the transition morphisms are surjective on triangles, or,
equivalently, the transition inverse image functors in the underlying
indcategory are full and faithful.

transition in fractal percolation, we introduce and study a class of continuum
fractal percolation models in dimension d greater than or equal to 2. These
include a scale invariant version of the classical (Poisson) Boolean model of
stochastic geometry and (for d=2) the Brownian loop soup introduced by Lawler
and Werner. The models lead to random fractal sets whose connectivity
properties depend on a parameter lambda. In this paper we mainly study the
transition between a phase where the random fractal sets are totally
disconnected and a phase where they contain connected components larger than
one point. In particular, we show that there are connected components larger
than one point at the unique value of lambda that separates the two phases
(called the critical point). We prove that such a behavior occurs also in
Mandelbrot's fractal percolation in all dimensions d greater than or equal to
2. Our results show that it is a generic feature, independent of the dimension
or the precise definition of the model, and is essentially a consequence of
scale invariance alone. Furthermore, for d=2 we prove that the presence of
connected components larger than one point implies the presence of a unique,
unbounded, connected component.

part of the unitarity criterion of Friedan, Qiu and Shenker, giving
restrictions on h for c=1-6/m(m+1) with m>2. In this paper we consider the same
problem in the limiting case of the coset construction c=1. Using primary
fields, we directly establish that the Virasoro algebra acts irreducibly on the
multiplicity spaces of irreducible representations of SU(2) in the two level
one irreducible representations of the corresponding affine Kac--Moody algebra.
This gives a direct proof that the only singular vectors in these
representations are those given by Goldstone's formulas, which also play an
important part in the proof. For this proof, the theory is developed from
scratch in a self-contained semi-expository way. Using the Jantzen filtration

the case c=1 which generalises to the case 0<c<1, where it provides an

{noiseless, noisy, generalized} feedback is proposed, and the associated

combining the Marton scheme and a lossy version of the Gray-Wyner scheme with
side-information. In each block the transmitter sends fresh data and update
information that allows the receivers to improve the channel outputs observed
in the previous block. For a generalization of Dueck's broadcast channel our
scheme achieves the noiseless-feedback capacity, which is strictly larger than
the no-feedback capacity. For a generalization of Blackwell's channel and when
the feedback is noiseless our new scheme achieves rate points that are outside
the no-feedback capacity region. It follows by a simple continuity argument
that for both these channels and when the feedback noise is sufficiently low,
our scheme improves on the no-feedback capacity even when the feedback is
noisy.

neuron receives excitatory input both from the driving Poisson stream and from
its own output through the feedback line. We obtain analytical expressions for

the polytope picture for the NMHV tree amplitude and give it a more direct and

scattering amplitudes in N=4 SYM has been described, generalizing the BCFW
formula for tree amplitudes, and making manifest the Yangian symmetry of the
theory. This has made it possible to easily study the structure of multi-loop
amplitudes in the theory. In this paper we describe a remarkable fact revealed
by these investigations: the integrand can be expressed in an amazingly simple
and manifestly local form when represented in momentum-twistor space using a
set of chiral integrals with unit leading singularities. As examples, we
present very-concise expressions for all 2- and 3-loop MHV integrands, as well
as all 2-loop NMHV integrands. We also describe a natural set of manifestly
IR-finite integrals that can be used to express IR-safe objects such as the
ratio function. Along the way we give a pedagogical introduction to the
foundations of the subject. The new local forms of the integrand are closely
connected to leading singularities---matching only a small subset of all
leading singularities remarkably suffices to determine the full integrand.
These results strongly suggest the existence of a theory for the integrand
directly yielding these local expressions, allowing for a more direct
understanding of the emergence of local spacetime physics.

semi-parametric empirical Bayes setting. Whereas the Bayesian posterior is
defined in terms of a prior distribution conditional on the observed data, the
confidence posterior is defined such that the probability that the parameter
value lies in any fixed subset of parameter space, given the observed data, is
equal to the coverage rate of the corresponding confidence interval. A
confidence posterior that has correct frequentist coverage at each fixed
parameter value is combined with the estimated local false discovery rate to
yield a parameter distribution from which interval and point estimates are
derived within the framework of minimizing expected loss. The point estimates
exhibit suitable shrinkage toward the null hypothesis value, making them
practical for automatically ranking features in order of priority. The
corresponding confidence intervals are also shrunken and tend to be much
shorter than their fixed-parameter counterparts, as illustrated with gene
expression data. Further, simulations confirm a theoretical argument that the
shrunken confidence intervals cover the parameter at a higher-than-nominal
frequency.

of quiescent galaxies down to ~10^{10} Msun even at z~2 for the first time. We
selected quiescent galaxies with age/tau>6 by performing SED fitting of the
multi broad-band photometry from the U to Spitzer 5.8um bands with the
population synthesis model of Bruzual & Charlot (2003) where exponentially
decaying star formation histories are assumed. The number density of quiescent
galaxies increases by a factor of ~3 from 1.0<z<1.5 to 0.5<z<1.0, and by a
factor of ~10 from 1.5<z<2.5 to 0.5<z<1.0, while that of star-forming galaxies
with age/tau<4 increases only by factors of ~2 and ~3 in the same redshift
ranges. At 0.5<z<2.5, the low-mass slope of the stellar mass function of
quiescent galaxies is alpha ~ 0 -- 0.6, which is significantly flatter than
those of star-forming galaxies (alpha ~ -1.3 -- -1.5). As a result, the
fraction of quiescent galaxies in the overall galaxy population increases with
stellar mass in the redshift range. The fraction of quiescent galaxies at
10^{11}-10^{11.5} Msun increases from ~20-30% at z~2 to ~40-60% at z~0.75,
while that at 10^{10}-10^{10.5} Msun increases from <~ 5% to ~15% in the same

formation had been more effective in more massive galaxies at 1<~z<~2. Such a
mass-dependent quenching could explain the rapid increase of the number density
of ~M* galaxies relative to lower-mass galaxies at z >~ 1-1.5.

simulations of isolated and merging disk galaxies in order to quantitatively
study the dependence of observed-frame submillimeter (submm) flux density on
galaxy properties. We find that submm flux density and star formation rate
(SFR) are related in dramatically different ways for quiescently star-forming
galaxies and starbursts. Because the stars formed in the merger-induced
starburst do not dominate the bolometric luminosity and the rapid drop in dust
mass and more compact geometry cause a sharp increase in dust temperature
during the burst, starbursts are very inefficient at boosting submm flux
density (e.g., a $\ga16$x boost in SFR yields a $\la 2$x boost in submm flux
density). Moreover, the ratio of submm flux density to SFR differs
significantly between the two modes; thus one cannot assume that the galaxies
with highest submm flux density are necessarily those with the highest
bolometric luminosity or SFR. These results have important consequences for the
bright submillimeter-selected galaxy (SMG) population. Among them are: 1. The
SMG population is heterogeneous. In addition to merger-driven starbursts, there
is a subpopulation of galaxy pairs, where two disks undergoing a major merger
but not yet strongly interacting are blended into one submm source because of
the large ($\ga 15$"", or $\sim 130$ kpc at $z = 2$) beam of single-dish submm
telescopes. 2. SMGs must be very massive ($M_{\star} \ga 6 \times 10^{10}
\msun$). 3. The infall phase makes the SMG duty cycle a factor of a few greater
than what is expected for a merger-driven starburst. (Abridged.)

curvature corrections give rise to cubic, order 1/R, and quartic, order 1/R^2,

cutoff for summing over heavy modes must be twice the one for light modes. With
this prescription the strong-weak coupling interpolating function h(\lambda),
entering the magnon dispersion relation, does not receive a one-loop

profiles traversing input queued switches is formulated in this paper. Target
outflow profiles specify the desirable inter-departure times of packets leaving
the switch from each traffic stream. The goal of the switch scheduler is to
dynamically select service configurations of the switch, so that actual outflow
streams (""pulled"" through the switch) adhere to their desired target profiles
as accurately as possible. Dynamic service controls (schedules) are developed
to minimize deviation of actual outflow streams from their targets and suppress
stream ""distortion"". Using appropriately selected subsets of service
configurations of the switch, efficient schedules are designed, which deliver
high performance at relatively low complexity. Some of these schedules are
provably shown to achieve 100% pull-throughput. Moreover, simulations
demonstrate that for even substantial contention of streams through the switch,
due to stringent/intense target outflow profiles, the proposed schedules
achieve closely their target profiles and suppress stream distortion. The
switch model investigated here deviates from the classical switching paradigm.
In the latter, the goal of packet scheduling is primarily to ""push"" as much
traffic load through the switch as possible, while controlling delay to
traverse the switch and keeping congestion/backlogs from exploding. In the
model presented here, however, the goal of packet scheduling is to ""pull""
traffic streams through the switch, maintaining desirable (target) outflow
profiles.

by Raich \cite{R10} that on a CR manifold of dimension $2n-1$ which is compact
pseudoconvex of hypersurface type embedded in $\C^n$ and orientable, the

required to be embedded. Second, when $(CR-P_q)$ holds for $q=1$ (and, in case

examined by counting number of computing pulses that can be applied

identical decoupling pulse sequence is applied within each cycle. By
considering pulses with mixed directions and finite width controlled by
magnetic fields, it is shown that pulse-width accumulation degrades the
performance of sequences with larger number of pulses and feasible magnetic
fields in practice restrict the consideration to sequences with number of
decoupling pulses being less than 10 within each cycle. Furthermore, within

construction of ""axion monodromy inflation"": the axion winds many times over
the course of inflation and draws energy from the 4-form. The classical theory
is equivalent to chaotic inflation with a quadratic inflaton potential. Such
models can produce ""high scale"" inflation driven by energy densities of the
order of $(10^{16}\ GeV)^4$, which produces primordial gravitational waves
potentially accessible to CMB polarization experiments. We analyze the possible
corrections to this scenario from the standpoint of 4d effective field theory,
identifying the physics which potentially suppresses dangerous corrections to
the slow-roll potential. This yields a constraint relation between the axion
decay constant, the inflaton mass, and the 4-form charge. We show how these
models can evade the fundamental constraints which typically make high-scale
inflation difficult to realize. Specifically, the moduli coupling to the
axion-four-form sector must have masses higher than the inflationary Hubble
scale ($\la\ 10^{14}\ GeV$). There are also constraints from states that become
light due to multiple windings of the axion, as happens in explicit string
theory constructions of this scenario. Further, such models generally have a

the predicted base pair fluctuation timescales - relevant to transcription -

demonstrate that nanoscale thermal transport can serve as a sensitive probe of
the underlying microscopic mechanisms responsible for the dynamics of DNA
denaturation. Specifically, we show that the heat transport properties of DNA
are altered significantly and abruptly as it denaturates, and this alteration
encodes detailed information on the dynamics of thermal fluctuations and their

discrimination between models of DNA denaturation. Measuring the thermal

a certain amount before the NMP domain can begin to open. Dynamical correlation
map shows interesting cross-peak between LID and NMP domain which suggests the
presence of correlated motion between them. This is also reflected in our

interesting elliptic shape, revealing a strong correlation between the opening
of the LID domain and that of the NMP domain. Our free energy surface of the
LID domain motion is rugged due to interaction with water and the signature of
ruggedness is evident in the observed RMSD variation and its fluctuation time
correlation functions. We develop a correlated dynamical disorder type
theoretical model to explain the observed dynamic coupling between the motions

significant components in the popular additive regression model is of great
interest. However, such components are unknown smooth functions of independent

this paper, we suggest a combination of penalized regression spline
approximation and group variable selection, called the lasso-type spline method
(LSM), to handle this component selection problem with a diverging number of
strongly correlated variables in each group. It is shown that the proposed
method can select significant components and estimate nonparametric additive
function components simultaneously with an optimal convergence rate
simultaneously. To make the LSM stable in computation and able to adapt its
estimators to the level of smoothness of the component functions, weighted
power spline bases and projected weighted power spline bases are proposed.
Their performance is examined by simulation studies across two set-ups with
independent predictors and correlated predictors, respectively, and appears
superior to the performance of competing methods. The proposed method is
extended to a partial linear regression model analysis with real data, and

inflation is driven by three NxN scalar field matrices in the adjoint
representation of U(N) gauge group. We focus our study on the gauged M-flation
model which could be derived from the dynamics of a stack of D3-branes in
appropriate background flux. The background inflationary dynamics is unaltered
compared to the ungauged case of [arXiv:0903.1481[hep-th]], while the spectrum
of ""spectator species"", the isocurvature modes, differs from the ungauged case.
Presence of a large number of spectators, although irrelevant to the slow-roll
inflationary dynamics has been argued to lower the effective UV cutoff
$\Lambda$ of the theory from the Planck mass, invalidating the main advantage
of M-flation in not having super-Planckian field values and unnaturally small
couplings. Through a careful analysis of the spectrum of the spectators we
argue that, contrary to what happens in N-flation models, M-flation is still UV
safe with the modified (reduced) effective UV cutoff $\Lambda$, which we show
to be of order (0.5-1)x10^{-1} M_{pl}. Moreover, we argue that the string scale

have applied some modification to the global Earliest Deadline First (EDF)

sensitivity analysis for task deadline context of multiprocessor system by
using a new approach of EFDF (Earliest Feasible Deadline First) algorithm. In
order to decrease the number of migrations we prevent a job from moving one
processor to another processor if it is among the m higher priority jobs.
Therefore, a job will continue its execution on the same processor if possible

where one scheme is preferable over the other. Partitioning schemes are better
suited for hard real-time systems, while a global scheme is preferable for soft

major drawbacks. First, the specific entropy profile of encrypted data makes
their detection very easy. Second, the use of cryptography can be more or less
regulated, not to say forbidden, according to the countries. If the right to
freely protect our personal and private data is a fundamental right, it must
not hinder the action of Nation States with respect to National security.
Allowing encryption to citizens holds for bad guys as well.
  In this paper we propose a new approach in information and communication
security that may solve all these issues, thus representing a rather
interesting trade-off between apparently opposite security needs. We introduce
the concept of scalable security based on computationnally hard problem of
coding theory with the PERSEUS technology.
  The core idea is to encode date with variable punctured convolutional codes
in such a way that any cryptanalytic attempt will require a time-consuming
encoder reconstruction in order to decode. By adding noise in a suitable way,
that reconstruction becomes untractable in practice except for Intelligence
services that however must use supercomputers during a significant, scalable
amount of time. Hence it limits naturally any will to unduly performs such
attacks (eg. against citizens' privacy).
  On the users' side, encoder and noise parameters are first exchanged through
an initial, short HTTPS session. The principles behind that approach have been
mathematically validated in 1997 and 2007. We present the PERSEUS library we
have developed under the triple GPL/LGPL/MPL licences. This library can be used
to protect any kind of data.

two cycles $C_6$ by a path $P_{n-12}$ with its two leaves. Let $\mathscr{B}_n$

which is obtained from joining two cycles $C_a$ and $C_b$ ($a, b\geq 10$ and $a

$P^{6,6}_n$, for $n=14$ and $n\geq 16$. In [X. Li, J. Zhang, On bicyclic graphs

up to $a+b=50$ were reported, supporting the conjecture. So, it is still
necessary to have a mathematical proof to this conjecture. This paper is to
show that the energy of $P^{6,6}_n$ is larger than that of $R_{a,b}$, which
proves the conjecture for bipartite bicyclic graphs. For non-bipartite bicyclic

of polarization indicates the dominance of Rayleigh scattering with a peak in
the blue B and U bands of ~10^-4+/-10^-5 and at least a factor of two lower
signal in the V band. The Rayleigh-like wavelength dependence, detected also in
the transmitted light during transits, implies a rapid decrease of the
polarization signal toward longer wavelengths. Therefore, the nondetection by
Wiktorowicz (2009), based on a measurement integrated within a broad passband
covering the V band and partly B and R bands, is inconclusive and consistent
with our detection in B. We discuss possible sources of the polarization and
demonstrate that effects of incomplete cancellation of stellar limb
polarization due to starspots or tidal perturbations are negligible as compared
to scattering polarization in the planetary atmosphere. We compare the
observations with a Rayleigh-Lambert model and determine effective radii and
geometrical albedos for different wavelengths. We find a close similarity of
the wavelength dependent geometrical albedo with that of the Neptune
atmosphere, which is known to be strongly influenced by Rayleigh and Raman
scattering. Our result establishes polarimetry as a reliable means for directly

functions and present its applications to quantum cryptography. We begin by
establishing the one-to-one correspondence between a linear function family
{\cal F} and a code family {\cal C}, and thereby defining \varepsilon-almost
dual universal_2 hash functions, as a generalization of the conventional
universal_2 hash functions. Then we show that this generalized (and thus
broader) class of hash functions is in fact sufficient for the security of
quantum cryptography. This result can be explained in two different formalisms.
First, by noting its relation to the \delta-biased family introduced by Dodis
and Smith, we demonstrate that Renner's two-universal hashing lemma is
generalized to our class of hash functions. Next, we prove that the proof
technique by Shor and Preskill can be applied to quantum key distribution (QKD)
systems that use our generalized class of hash functions for privacy
amplification. While Shor-Preskill formalism requires an implementer of a QKD
system to explicitly construct a linear code of the Calderbank-Shor-Steane
type, this result removes the existing difficulty of the construction a linear
code of CSS code by replacing it by the combination of an ordinary classical
error correcting code and our proposed hash function. We also show that a
similar result applies to the quantum wire-tap channel. Finally we compare our
results in the two formalisms and show that, in typical QKD scenarios, the
Shor-Preskill--type argument gives better security bounds in terms of the trace
distance and Holevo information, than the method based on the \delta-biased
family.

supOU processes, provide a class of continuous time processes capable of
exhibiting long memory behavior. This paper introduces multivariate supOU
processes and gives conditions for their existence and finiteness of moments.
Moreover, the second-order moment structure is explicitly calculated, and
examples exhibit the possibility of long-range dependence. Our supOU processes
are defined via homogeneous and factorizable L\'{e}vy bases. We show that the
behavior of supOU processes is particularly nice when the mean reversion
parameter is restricted to normal matrices and especially to strictly negative
definite ones. For finite variation L\'{e}vy bases we are able to give
conditions for supOU processes to have locally bounded c\`{a}dl\`{a}g paths of
finite variation and to show an analogue of the stochastic differential
equation of OU-type processes, which has been suggested in \cite
barndorffnielsen01 in the univariate case. Finally, as an important special
case, we introduce positive semi-definite supOU processes, and we discuss the
relevance of multivariate supOU processes in applications.

in the context of, for instance, Solvency II and to some extent IFRS 4. We
propose an explicit and consistent framework for the valuation of insurance
liabilities which incorporates the Solvency II approach as a special case.
  The proposed framework is based on dynamic replication over multiple
(one-year) time periods by a portfolio of assets with reliable market prices,
allowing for ""limited liability"" in the sense that the replication can in
general not always be continued. The asset portfolio consist of two parts: (1)
assets whose market price defines the value of the insurance liabilities, and
(2) capital funds used to cover risk which cannot be replicated. The capital
funds give rise to capital costs; the main exogenous input of the framework is
the condition on when the investment of the capital funds is acceptable.
  We investigate existence of the value and show that the exact calculation of
the value has to be done recursively backwards in time, starting at the end of
the lifetime of the insurance liabilities. The main question only partially
considered in this paper is the uniqueness of the value. We derive upper bounds
on the value and, for the special case of replication by risk-free one-year
zero-coupon bonds, explicit recursive formulas for calculating the value.
  Valuation in Solvency II and IFRS 4 is based on representing the value as a
sum of a ""best estimate"" and a ""risk margin"". In our framework, it turns out
that this split is not natural. Nonetheless, we show that a split can be
constructed as a simplification, and that it provides an upper bound on the
value under suitable conditions. We illustrate the general results by
explicitly calculating the value for a simple example.

observation from 2010 October extends our tracking of the neutron star surface
temperature from ~800 days to ~1160 days since the end of an exceptionally
luminous 19 month outburst. This observation indicates that the neutron star
crust may still be slowly cooling toward thermal equilibrium with the core;
another observation further into quiescence is needed to verify this. The shape
of the overall cooling curve is consistent with that of a broken power law,
although an exponential decay to a constant level cannot be excluded with the
present data. To investigate possible low-level activity, we conducted a
monitoring campaign of XTE J1701-462 with Swift during 2010 April-October.
Short-term flares - presumably arising from episodic low-level accretion - were
observed up to a luminosity of ~1e35 erg/s, ~20 times higher than the normal
quiescent level. We conclude that flares of this magnitude are not likely to
have significantly affected the equilibrium temperature of the neutron star and
are probably not able to have a measurable impact on the cooling curve.
However, it is possible that brighter and longer periods of low-level activity
have had an appreciable effect on the equilibrium temperature.

Another consequence is that the popular interpretation of Josephson qubits as

Kepler mission. Long and continuous photometric observations of unprecedented
quality are now available which have stimulated the development of a number of
suites of innovative analysis tools.
  Aims: The power spectra of solar-like oscillations are an inexhaustible
source of information on stellar structure and evolution. Robust methods are
hence needed in order to infer both individual oscillation mode parameters and
parameters describing non-resonant features, thus making a seismic
interpretation possible.
  Methods: We present a comprehensive guide to the implementation of a Bayesian
peak-bagging tool that employs a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Besides
making it possible to incorporate relevant prior information through Bayes'
theorem, this tool also allows one to obtain the marginal probability density
function for each of the fitted parameters. We apply this tool to a couple of
recent asteroseismic data sets, namely, to CoRoT observations of HD 49933 and
to ground-based observations made during a campaign devoted to Procyon.
  Results: The developed method performs remarkably well at constraining not
only in the traditional case of extracting oscillation frequencies, but also
when pushing the limit where traditional methods have difficulties. Moreover it
provides an rigorous way of comparing competing models, such as the ridge
identifications, against the asteroseismic data.

for the 2-dimensional wave energy spectrum density, S(x,t), spread in the
space, x, and time, t. This equation has the forcing named the source function,
F, depending on both the wave spectrum, S, and the external wave-making
factors: local wind, W(x, t), and local current, U(x, t). The source function
contains certain physical mechanisms responsible for a wave spectrum evolution.
It is used to distinguish three terms in function F: the wind-wave energy
exchange mechanism, In; the energy conservative mechanism of nonlinear
wave-wave interactions, Nl; and the wave energy loss mechanism, Dis.
Differences in mathematical representation of the source function terms
determine general differences between wave models. The problem is to derive
analytical representations for the source function terms said above from the
fundamental wave equations. Basing on publications of numerous authors and on
the last two decades studies of the author, the optimized versions of the all
principal terms for the source function, F, have been constructed. Detailed
description of these results is presented. The final version of the source
function is tested in academic test tasks and verified by implementing it into
numerical shells of the well known wind wave models: WAM and WAVEWATCH.
Procedures of testing and verification are presented and described in details.
The superiority of the proposed new source function in accuracy and speed of
calculations is shown. Finally, the directions of future developments in this
topic are proposed, and some possible applications of numerical wind wave
models are shown, aimed to study both the wind wave physics and global
wind-wave variability at the climate scale, including mechanical energy
exchange between wind, waves, and upper water layer.

overlap regions of data space. As an alternative to this so called hard
classification approach, we propose estimating posterior probabilities of each
diffractive class and using these estimates to weigh event contributions to
physical observables. It is shown with a Monte Carlo study that such a soft
classification scheme is able to reproduce observables such as multiplicity
distributions and relative event rates with a much higher accuracy than hard
classification.

from the observation that nonblocking MPI is not able to hide communication

high-temperature resistance is observed to go to zero at a critical pressure of

Threading Building Blocks (TBB) components, although ideal for tackling

software layer ameliorates adverse effects of dynamic task distribution by
sorting tasks into locality queues, each of which is preferably processed by
threads that belong to the same locality domain. Dynamic scheduling is fully
preserved inside each domain, and is preferred over possible load imbalance
even if nonlocal access is required, making this strategy well-suited for
typical multicore-mutisocket systems. The effectiveness of the approach is
demonstrated by using a blocked six-point stencil solver as a toy model.

keto-amino skew (i.e. excess of G and T over A and C). The extents of these
biases depend upon gene expression patterns. The highest intronic keto-amino

reveal the critical role of water in stabilizing a key intermediate formed by
CO2 bound to cobalt. Using potential of mean force calculations, the
intermediate is found to spontaneously accept a proton to form a carboxylate
acid group at pH<9.0, and the subsequent cleavage of a C-OH bond to form CO is
exothermic and associated with a small free energy barrier. These predictions
