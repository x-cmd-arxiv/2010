manifolds, the holomorphic curves representing a fixed 2-homology class do not
form a proper family in general. The deep source of this fundamental difficulty
in non-K\""ahler geometry is the {\it explosion of the area} phenomenon: the
area of a curve $C_b\subset X_b$ in a fixed 2-homology class can diverge as
$b\to b_0$. This phenomenon occurs frequently in the deformation theory of
class VII surfaces. For instance it is well known that any minimal GSS surface
$X_0$ is a degeneration of a 1-parameter family of simply blown up primary Hopf
surfaces $(X_z)_{z\in D\setminus\{0\}}$, so one obtains non-proper families of
exceptional divisors $E_z\subset X_z$ whose area diverge as $z\to 0$. Our main
goal is to study in detail this non-properness phenomenon in the case of class
VII surfaces. We will prove that, under certain technical assumptions, a lift
$\widetilde E_z$ of $E_z$ in the universal cover $\widetilde X_z$ does converge
to an effective divisor $\widetilde E_0$ in $\widetilde X_0$, but this limit
divisor is not compact. We prove that this limit divisor is always bounded
towards the pseudo-convex end of $\widetilde X_0$ and that, when $X_0$ is a a
minimal surface with global spherical shell, it is given by an infinite series
of {\it compact} rational curves, whose coefficients can be computed
explicitly. This phenomenon - degeneration of a family of compact curves to an
infinite union of compact curves - should be called {\it infinite bubbling}.
  We believe that such a decomposition result holds for any family of class VII
surfaces whose generic fiber is a blown up primary Hopf surface. This statement
would have important consequences for the classification of class VII surfaces.

acoustic oscillations in growing neutrino quintessence. In this scenario, the
neutrino mass has a strong dependence on the quintessence field. The induced
coupling stops the evolution of the field when the neutrinos become
nonrelativistic, and triggers the transition to the accelerating phase of the
cosmological expansion. At redshifts around five, the neutrino fluctuations are
still linear and acoustic oscillations are present in the neutrino power
spectrum, induced by the acoustic oscillations in the baryonic and dark-matter
sectors. The neutrino perturbations become nonlinear at redshifts around three.
The mode coupling generated by the nonlinearities erases the oscillations in
the neutrino spectrum at some redshift above two. There is a potential danger
that at later times the influence of the gravitational potentials induced by
the neutrino inhomogeneities could erase the oscillations from the baryonic and
dark-matter spectra, making the scenario incompatible with observations. For
the scenario to be viable, the neutrino-induced gravitational potentials in the

of a Young diagram with $n$ boxes with the alphabet $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$. Using
the adjacent-pair matrix we make more explicit and also extend some statements
concerning highest forms of linear operators in previous work of Tymoczko.
Second, for a nilpotent operator $N$ and Hessenberg function $h$, we construct
an explicit bijection between the $S^1$-fixed points of the nilpotent
Hessenberg variety $\Hess(N,h)$ and the set of $(h,\lambda_N)$-permissible
fillings of the Young diagram $\lambda_N$. Third, we use poset pinball, the

$S^1$-equivariant cohomology of type $A$ Springer varieties
$\mathcal{S}_{(n-2,2)}$ associated to Young diagrams of shape $(n-2,2)$ for

Betti-acceptable pinball described by Bayegan and Harada to specify a subset of
the equivariant Schubert classes in the $T$-equivariant cohomology of the flag
variety $\mathcal{F}\ell ags(\C^n)$ which maps to a module basis of

an olivine core as they pass through a spiral shock in a protoplanetary disk.
We use published three-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of
massive self-gravitating protoplanetary disks to extract the thermodynamics of
spiral shocks in the region between 10 and 20 AU from the central star. As the
density wave passes, it heats the grains, causing them to lose their ice shell
and resulting in a lowering of the grain opacity. In addition, since grains of
different sizes will have slightly different temperatures, there will be a
migration of ice from the hotter grains to the cooler ones. The rate of
migration depends on the temperature of the background gas, so a grain
distribution that is effectively stable for low temperatures, can undergo an
irreversible change in opacity if the gas is temporarily heated to above $\sim
150$\,K. We find that the opacity can drop more, and at a significantly faster
rate throughout the spiral shocks relative to the prediction of standard dust
grains models adopted in hydrodynamical calculations of protoplanetary disks.
This would lead to faster gas cooling within spiral arms. We discuss the
implications of our results on the susceptibility of disk fragmentation into
sub-stellar objects at distances of a few tens of astronomical units.

through elastic collisions with the medium and by scattering of shower partons
to larger angles. We find that the jet energy loss at early times is dominated
by medium effects on the vacuum radiation, and by medium-induced radiation

sized dust to massive giant planets occurs in disks around young stars. After
introducing a number of observational constraints from the solar system, from
observed protoplanetary disks, and from the extrasolar planets, we simplify the
problem by dividing it into a number of discrete stages which are assumed to
occur in a sequential way. In the first stage - the growth from dust to
kilometer sized planetesimals - the aerodynamics of the bodies are of central
importance. We discuss both a purely coagulative growth mode, as well as a
gravoturbulent mode involving a gravitational instability of the dust. In the
next stage, planetesimals grow to protoplanets of roughly 1000 km in size.
Gravity is now the dominant force. The mass accretion can be strongly
non-linear, leading to the detachment of a few big bodies from the remaining
planetesimals. In the outer planetary system (outside a few AU), some of these
bodies can become so massive that they eventually accrete a large gaseous
envelope. This is the stage of giant planet formation, as understood within the
core accretion-gas capture paradigm. We also discuss the direct gravitational
collapse model where giant planets are thought to form directly via a
gravitational fragmentation of the gas disk. In the inner system, protoplanets
collide in the last stage - probably after the dispersal of the gaseous disk -
in giant impacts until the separations between the remaining terrestrial
planets become large enough to allow long term stability. We finish the review
with some selected questions.

and a random part. The former may describe any model of N identical phonon
bands, while the latter is a d-dimensional generalization of the random matrix
model of Lueck, Sommers, and Zirnbauer (LSZ). The models are constructed so as
to exclude the unphysical occurrence of runaway solutions. By using the
Efetov-Wegner supersymmetry method in combination with the new technique of
superbosonization, the disordered boson model is cast in the form of a
supermatrix field theory. A self-consistent approximation of mean-field type
arises from treating the field theory as a variational problem. The resulting

large values of N. In the random-matrix limit, agreement with the results of

magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). However, whenever the ion density of the plasma
becomes sufficiently low, the Hall effect is likely to become important. The
role of the Hall effect has been studied in several astrophysical plasma
processes, such as magnetic reconnection, magnetic dynamo, MHD turbulence or
MHD instabilities. In particular, the development of small-scale instabilities
is essential to understand the transport properties in a number of
astrophysical plasmas. The magneto-rotational instability, which takes place in
differentially rotating accretion disks embedded in relatively weak magnetic
fields, is just one example. The influence of the large-scale velocity flows on
small-scale instabilities is often approximated by a linear shear flow. In this
paper we quantitatively study the role of the Hall effect on plasmas embedded
in large-scale shear flows. More precisely, we show that a new instability
develops as long as the Hall effect is present, which we therefore term as the
Hall magneto-shear instability. As a particular case, we recover the so-called
magneto-rotational instability and quantitatively assess the role of the Hall
effect on its development and evolution.

outburst in 2008 in the CO fundamental band at 4.6-5.0 um. The observations
were carried out at the VLT and the Subaru Telescope at six epochs from April
to August 2008, covering the plateau of the outburst and the fading phase to a
quiescent state. The line flux of CO emission declines with the visual
brightness of the star and the continuum flux at 5 um, but composed of two
subcomponents that decay with different rates. The narrow line emission (50 km
s-1 in FWHM) is near the systemic velocity of EX Lupi. These emission lines
appear exclusively in v=1-0. The line widths translate to a characteristic
orbiting radius of 0.4 AU. The broad line component (FWZI ~ 150 km s-1) is
highly excited upto v<=6. The line flux of the component decreases faster than
the narrow line emission. Simple modeling of the line profiles implies that the
broad-line emitting gas is orbiting around the star at 0.04-0.4 AU. The
excitation state, the decay speed of the line flux, and the line profile,
indicate that the broad-line emission component is physically distinct from the
narrow-line emission component, and more tightly related to the outburst event.

proved the 1995 conjecture that, for fixed delta, Severi degrees are eventually
polynomial in d.
  In this paper, we study the Severi varieties corresponding to a large family
of toric surfaces. We prove the analogous result that the Severi degrees are
eventually polynomial as a function of the multidegree. More surprisingly, we
show that the Severi degrees are also eventually polynomial ""as a function of

of a singular surface.

two powerful tools to determine the protein 3D structure. However, not all

Although NMR spectroscopy is indeed very powerful in determining the 3D
structures of membrane proteins, same as X-ray crystallography, it is still
very time-consuming and expensive. Under many circumstances, due to the
noncrystalline and insoluble nature of some proteins, X-ray and NMR cannot be
used at all. Computational approaches, however, allow us to obtain a
description of the protein 3D structure at a submicroscopic level.
  To the best of the author's knowledge, there is little structural data
available to date on the AGAAAAGA palindrome in the hydrophobic region
(113--120) of prion proteins, which falls just within the N-terminal
unstructured region (1--123) of prion proteins. Many experimental studies have
shown that the AGAAAAGA region has amyloid fibril forming properties and plays
an important role in prion diseases. However, due to the noncrystalline and
insoluble nature of the amyloid fibril, little structural data on the AGAAAAGA
is available. This paper introduces a simple optimization strategy approach to
address the 3D atomic-resolution structure of prion AGAAAAGA amyloid fibrils.
Atomic-resolution structures of prion AGAAAAGA amyloid fibrils got in this

Theory errors in exclusive rates are dominated by form factors' normalization.
They can be reduced in rate ratios like the K* polarization fractions in B -->

smaller. Alternatively, b --> s/d E_miss can receive contributions from

Lagrangian is computed onshell. The corrections to the neutralino and chargino
masses, due to these operators, are computed analytically in function of the

of few GeV for the constrained MSSM (CMSSM) viable parameter space. We
investigate the correction to the lightest Higgs mass, which receives, from
individual operators, a supersymmetric correction of up to 4 (6) GeV above the
2-loop leading-log CMSSM value, from those CMSSM phase space points with: EW
fine tuning Delta<200, consistent with WMAP relic density (3$\sigma$), and for
a scale of the operators of M=10 (8) TeV, respectively. Applied to the CMSSM
point of minimal fine tuning (Delta=18), such increase gives an upper limit
$m_h=120(122)\pm 2$ GeV, respectively. The increase of m_h from individual
operators can be larger ($\sim$ 10-30 GeV) for those CMSSM phase space points

of the Moon is not precisely known. In recent years, however, the isotopic
composition of lunar samples has been determined to high precision and found to
be indistinguishable from the terrestrial mantle despite widespread isotopic
heterogeneity in the Solar System. In the context of the giant-impact
hypothesis, this level of isotopic homogeneity can evolve if the proto-lunar
disk and post-impact Earth undergo turbulent mixing into a single uniform
reservoir while the system is extensively molten and partially vaporized. In
the absence of liquid-vapor separation, such a model leads to the lunar
inheritance of the chemical composition of the terrestrial magma ocean. Hence,
the turbulent mixing model raises the question of how chemical differences
arose between the silicate Earth and Moon. Here we explore the consequences of
liquid-vapor separation in one of the settings relevant to the lunar
composition: the silicate vapor atmosphere of the post-giant-impact Earth. We
use a model atmosphere to quantify the extent to which rainout can generate
chemical differences by enriching the upper atmosphere in the vapor, and show
that plausible parameters can generate the postulated enhancement in the
FeO/MgO ratio of the silicate Moon relative to the Earth's mantle. Moreover, we
show that liquid-vapor separation also generates measurable mass-dependent
isotopic offsets between the silicate Earth and Moon and that precise silicon
isotope measurements can be used to constrain the degree of chemical
fractionation during this earliest period of lunar history. An approach of this

the odd-frequency pairing that the pairing interaction is strongly retarded as

phenomena, the version of the adiabatic approximation that can account for the
transition from a bound state to the continuum must be employed. Despite much
work in this topic, a universally accepted adiabatic approach of bound-free
transitions is lacking. Hence, based on Savichev's modified adiabatic
approximation [Sov. Phys. JETP 73, 803 (1991)], we first of all derive the most
convenient form of the adiabatic approximation for the problems at hand.
Connections of the obtained result with the quasiclassical approximation and

double ionization of atoms in a strong low frequency laser field.

Elias (1972) generalized von Neumann's scheme and showed how to achieve optimal
efficiency in unbiased random bits generation. Hence, a natural question is
what if the sources are correlated? Both Elias and Samuelson proposed methods
for generating unbiased random bits in the case of correlated sources (of
unknown probability distribution), specifically, they considered finite Markov
chains. However, their proposed methods are not efficient or have
implementation difficulties. Blum (1986) devised an algorithm for efficiently
generating random bits from degree-2 finite Markov chains in expected linear
time, however, his beautiful method is still far from optimality on
information-efficiency. In this paper, we generalize Blum's algorithm to
arbitrary degree finite Markov chains and combine it with Elias's method for

the perpendicular and oblique shocks is obtained. Numerical solution of the
perpendicular shock has been shown in the figures, which finds that the
magnetic field helps in shock generation. It indirectly hints at the
instability of the matter and thereby the NS for very high magnetic field,
implying that NSs can only support finite magnetic field strength.

the form of the upper end of the stellar initial mass-final mass relation. We
identify four objects with cooling times, distances and proper motions
consistent with membership of these clusters. We find that despite a range in
age of ~100Myr the masses of the four heaviest white dwarfs in NGC3532 span the
narrow mass interval M~0.9-1.0Msolar suggesting that the initial mass-final
mass relation is relatively flatter over 4.5Msolar <~ M_init <~ 6.5Msolar than
at immediately lower masses. Additionally, we have unearthed WD J0646-203 which
is possibly the most massive cluster white dwarf identified to date. With
M~1.1Msolar it seems likely to be composed of ONe and has a cooling time
consistent with it having evolved from a single star.

work, we compare the two models experimentally. This not only shows that the
quasirandom model generally is faster, but also that the runtime is more
concentrated around the mean. This is surprising given that much fewer random
bits are used in the quasirandom process. These advantages are also observed in
a lossy communication model, where each transmission does not reach its target

which we interpret as an indication of the partial resolution of the dust
sublimation region. The effective ring radii derived from the observed
visibilities scale approximately with L^1/2, where L is the AGN luminosity.
Comparing the radii with those from independent optical-infrared reverberation
measurements, these data support our previous claim that the interferometric
ring radius is either roughly equal to or slightly larger than the
reverberation radius. We interpret the ratio of these two radii for a given L

material. We show tentative evidence that this inner radial structure might be
closely related to the radio-loudness of the central engine. Finally, we
re-observed the brightest Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC4151. Its marginally higher

images from the Australia Telescope Compact Array are combined with 12CO(J=1-0)
data from the NANTEN telescope to reveal substantial quantities of molecular
gas closely associated with both shells. These data allow us to confirm an
enhanced level of molecularization over the volumes of both objects, providing
the first direct observational evidence of increased molecular cloud production
due to the influence of supershells. We find that the atomic shell walls are
dominated by cold gas with estimated temperatures and densities of T ~ 100 K
and n0 ~ 10 cm-3. Locally, the shells show rich substructure in both tracers,
with molecular gas seen elongated along the inner edges of the atomic walls,
embedded within HI filaments and clouds, or taking the form of small CO clouds
at the tips of tapering atomic `fingers'. We discuss these structures in the
context of different formation scenarios, suggesting that molecular gas
embedded within shell walls is well explained by in-situ formation from the
swept up medium, whereas CO seen at the ends of fingers of HI may trace
remnants of molecular clouds that pre-date the shells. A preliminary assessment
of star formation activity within the shells confirms ongoing star formation in
the molecular gas of both GSH 287+04-17 and GSH 277+00+36.

complicated materials, different stress concepts are used with ambiguity or
different understanding. Geometrically, a material element is expressed by a
closed region with arbitral shape. The internal region is acted by distance
dependent force (internal body force), while the surface is acted by surface
force. Further more, the element as a whole is in a physical background
(exterior region) which is determined by the continuum where the element is
embedded (external body force). Physically, the total energy can be additively
decomposed as three parts: internal region energy, surface energy, and the
background energy. However, as forces, they cannot be added directly. After
formulating the general forms of physical fields, the deformation tensor is
introduced to formulate the force variations caused by deformation. As the
force variation is expressed by the deformation tensor, the deformation stress
concept is well formulated. Furthermore, as a natural result, the additive
decomposition gives out the definition of static continuum, which determines
the material parameters in constitutive equations. Through using the exterior
differentials, the constitutive equations are formulated in general form.
Throughout the paper, when it is suitable, the related results are simplified

to describe nonequilibrium phenomena in cosmology. On the other hand, it is
known that in gauge theories at high temperature processes involving many
quanta, which naively are of higher order in the coupling, contribute to the
relaxation rate at leading order. How does this accord with the use of single
particle distribution functions in the kinetic equations? When can these
effects be parametrised in an effective description in terms of quasiparticles?
And what is the kinematic role of their thermal masses? We address these
questions in the framework of nonequilibrium quantum field theory and develop
an intuitive picture in which contributions from higher order processes are
parametrised by the widths of resonances in the plasma. In the narrow width
limit we recover the quasiparticle picture, with the additional processes
giving rise to off-shell parts of quasiparticle propagators that appear to
violate energy conservation. In this regime we give analytic expressions for
the scalar and fermion nonequilibrium propagators in a medium. We compare the
efficiency of decays and scatterings involving real quasiparticles, computed
from analytic expressions for the relaxation rates via trilinear scalar and
Yukawa interactions for all modes, to off-shell contributions and find that the
latter can be significant even for moderate widths. Our results apply to
various processes including thermal production of particles from a plasma,
dissipation of fields in a medium and particle propagation in dense matter. We
discuss cosmological implications, in particular for the maximal temperature
achieved during reheating by perturbative inflaton decay.

based on an integrated luminosity of 1.3 pb-1, have been corrected for all
known detector effects and are quoted in a limited and well-defined range of
jet and lepton kinematics. The measured cross sections are compared to
particle-level predictions based on perturbative QCD. Next-to-leading order
calculations, studied here for n \le 2, are found in good agreement with the

superfluid neutron liquid are studied for the case of condensate involving

condensate in the timelike domain of the energy and momentum are analyzed.
Along with the well-known excitations in the form of broken Cooper pairs, the
theoretical analysis predicts the existence of collective waves of spin density
at very low energy. Because of a rather small excitation energy of spin waves,
their decay leads to a substantial neutrino emission at the lowest
temperatures, when all other mechanisms of neutrino energy loss are killed by a
superfluidity. Neutrino energy losses caused by the pair recombination and
spin-wave decays are examined in all of the multicomponent phases that might
represent the ground state of the condensate, according to modern theories, and
for the case when a phase transition occurs in the condensate at some
temperature. Our estimate predicts a sharp increase in the neutrino energy
losses followed by a decrease, along with a decrease in the temperature, that
takes place more rapidly than it would without the phase transition. We
demonstrate the important role of the neutrino radiation caused by the decay of
spin waves in the cooling of neutron stars.

equation for the CPR elements of the T-matrix for a given collision energy in
the two-nucleon sector of the Hilbert space of hadronic states.

observed ""evidence for E8 symmetry"" in the laboratory. This expository article
is aimed at mathematicians and explains the chain of reasoning connecting
measurements on a quasi-1-dimensional magnet with a 248-dimensional Lie
algebra.
