is considered, where only the receiver has knowledge of the channel impulse
response. An approach for combining decision-feedback equalization with channel
coding is proposed, where decoding precedes the removal of intersymbol
interference. This is accomplished by combining the recently proposed
integer-forcing equalization approach with cyclic block codes. The channel
impulse response is linearly equalized to an integer-valued response. This is
then utilized by leveraging the property that a cyclic code is closed under

However, most programming languages use specific evaluation strategies, whereas
loop detection techniques usually do not take strategies into account. So even
if a rewrite system has a loop, it may still be terminating under certain
strategies.
  Therefore, our goal is to develop decision procedures which can determine
whether a given loop is also a loop under the respective evaluation strategy.
In earlier work, such procedures were presented for the strategies of
innermost, outermost, and context-sensitive evaluation. In the current paper,
we build upon this work and develop such decision procedures for important
strategies like leftmost-innermost, leftmost-outermost,
(max-)parallel-innermost, (max-)parallel-outermost, and forbidden patterns
(which generalize innermost, outermost, and context-sensitive strategies). In
this way, we obtain the first approach to disprove termination under these

in practice, the number of additional lexleader constraints is typically
polynomial number in the size of the instance. For polynomially many lexleader

polynomially many lexleader constraints may provide practically useful symmetry
breaking -- and they sometimes exclude super-exponentially many solutions. We

increase with galaxy mass. This relation holds also for early-type dwarf
galaxies, although it seems to steepen at low masses. The [alpha/Fe] vs. mass
relation can be explained assuming that smaller galaxies form over longer
timescales (downsizing), allowing a larger amount of Fe (mostly produced by
long-living Type Ia Supernovae) to be released and incorporated into newly
forming stars. Another way to obtain the same result is by using a flatter
initial mass function (IMF) in large galaxies, increasing in this way the
number of Type II Supernovae and therefore the production rate of
alpha-elements. The integrated galactic initial mass function (IGIMF) theory
predicts that the higher the star formation rate, the flatter the IMF. We have
checked, by means of semi-analytical calculations, that the IGIMF theory,
combined with the downsizing effect (i.e. the shorter duration of the star
formation in larger galaxies), well reproduces the observed [alpha/Fe] vs. mass
relation. In particular, we show a steepening of this relation in dwarf
galaxies, in accordance with the available observations.

a strong bearing on its anisotropic stress response. The mean-square bond
length and mean bond angle are the critical parameters that influence the
time-varying stress developed in the polymer. The bond length distribution
along the chain is uniform without any abrupt changes at the ends. Among the
externally set parameters such as density, temperature, strain rate, and chain
length, the density as well as the chain length of the polymer have a
significant effect on the stress. At high density values, changes in
mean-square bond length dominates over changes in radius of gyration and
end-to-end length. In other words, bond deformations dominate as opposed to
changes in size and shape. Also, there is a large change in the mean-square
bond length that is reflected as a jump in the stress. Beyond a particular
value of the chain length, $n = 50$, called the entanglement length,
stress-response is found to have distinctly different behavior which we
attribute to the entanglement effects. Short chain polymers more or less behave
like rigid molecules. There is no significant change in their internal
structure when loaded. Further, temperature and rate of loading have a very
mild effect on the stress. Besides these new results, we can now explain well
known polymeric mechanical behavior under dynamic loading from the point of
view of the evolution of the molecular dynamics and the derived structural
properties. This could possibly lead to polymer synthesis with desired
mechanical behavior.

simplistic language Isaac Asimov is able to explain what rules a robot must

they are outdated they still represent some of our innate fears which are
beginning to resurface in present day 21st Century. Our society is on the
advent of a new revolution; a revolution led by advances in Computer Science,
Artificial Intelligence & Nanotechnology. Some of our advances have been so
phenomenal that we surpassed what was predicted by the Moore's law. With these
advancements comes the fear that our future may be at the mercy of these
androids. Humans today are scared that we, ourselves, might create something
which we cannot control. We may end up creating something which can not only
learn much faster than anyone of us can, but also evolve faster than what the
theory of evolution has allowed us to. The greatest fear is not only that we
might lose our jobs to these intelligent beings, but that these beings might
end up replacing us at the top of the cycle. The public hysteria has been
heightened more so by a number of cultural works which depict annihilation of
the human race by robots. Right from Frankenstein to I, Robot mass media has
also depicted such issues. This paper is an effort to understand the need for
ethics in Robotics or simply termed as Roboethics. This is achieved by the
study of artificial beings and the thought being put behind them. By the end of

fermionic part. It is found that the positivity of the spectral density of the
bosonic two-point correlation function is ensured only for the spacial momenta

computing. We address the problem of continuous-variable (unconditional and
conditional) teleportation of a pure single-photon state and a mixed attenuated
single-photon state generally in a nonunity gain regime. Our figure of merit is
the maximum of negativity of the Wigner function that witnesses highly
non-classical feature of the teleported state. We find that negativity of the
Wigner function of the single-photon state can be {\em unconditionally}
teleported for arbitrarily weak squeezed state used to create the entangled
state shared in the teleportation. In contrast, for the attenuated
single-photon state there is a strict threshold squeezing one has to surpass in
order to successfully teleport the negativity of its Wigner function. The {\em
conditional} teleportation allows to approach perfect transmission of the
single photon for an arbitrarily low squeezing at a cost of a success rate. On
the other hand, for the attenuated single photon conditional teleportation
cannot overcome the squeezing threshold of the unconditional teleportation and
it approaches negativity of the input state only if the squeezing
simultaneously increases. However, as soon as the threshold squeezing is
surpassed the conditional teleportation still pronouncedly outperforms the

of the number of smooth words of length $n$ respectively, which is simpler and
more intuitionistic than the previous methods.

pattern of clusters, super-clusters, filaments and voids with sizes limited
only by the boundaries of the available samples. A quantitative statistical
characterization of these structures shows that galaxy distribution is
inhomogeneous in these samples, being characterized by large-amplitude
fluctuations of large spatial extension. Over a large range of scales, both the
average conditional density and its variance show a nontrivial scaling
behavior: at small scales, r<20 Mpc/h, the average (conditional) density scales
as 1/r. At larger scales, the density depends only weakly (logarithmically) on
the system size and density fluctuations follow the Gumbel distribution of
extreme value statistics. These complex behaviors are different from what is
expected in a homogeneous distribution with Gaussian fluctuations. The observed
density inhomogeneities pose a fundamental challenge to the standard picture of
cosmology but it also represent an important opportunity which points to new
directions with respect to many cosmological puzzles. Indeed, the fact that
matter distribution is not uniform, in the limited range of scales sampled by
observations, rises the question of understanding how inhomogeneities affect
the large-scale dynamics of the universe. We discuss several attempts which try
to model inhomogeneities in cosmology, considering their effects with respect
to the role and abundance of dark energy and dark matter.

Wikipedia, the proof of an ongoing paradigm shift from hierarchically-managed

place to refer to FOSS as a manifestation of collective intelligence where
deliverables and artefacts emerge by virtue of mere cooperation, with no need

limited understanding of the software development process, and may lead to
wrong conclusions as to the potential of peer production. The development of a
less than trivial piece of software, irrespective of whether it be FOSS or
proprietary, is a complex cooperative effort requiring the participation of
many (often thousands of) individuals. A subset of the participants always play
the role of leading system and subsystem designers, determining architecture
and functionality; the rest of the people work ""underneath"" them in a logical,
functional sense. While new and powerful forces, including FOSS, are clearly at
work in the post-industrial, networked econ-omy, the currently ingenuous stage
of research in the field of collective intelligence and networked cooperation
must give way to a deeper level of consciousness, which requires an
understanding of the software development process.

throughput and decoding-delay performance of random linear network coding as a
function of the coding window size and the network size. Our model consists of
a source transmitting packets of a single flow to a set of $n$ users over
independent erasure channels. The source performs random linear network coding
(RLNC) over $k$ (coding window size) packets and broadcasts them to the users.
We note that the broadcast throughput of RLNC must vanish with increasing $n$,
for any fixed $k.$ Hence, in contrast to other works in the literature, we
investigate how the coding window size $k$ must scale for increasing $n$. Our
analysis reveals that the coding window size of $\Theta(\ln(n))$ represents a
phase transition rate, below which the throughput converges to zero, and above
which it converges to the broadcast capacity. Further, we characterize the
asymptotic distribution of decoding delay and provide approximate expressions
for the mean and variance of decoding delay for the scaling regime of
$k=\omega(\ln(n)).$ These asymptotic expressions reveal the impact of channel
correlations on the throughput and delay performance of RLNC. We also show how
our analysis can be extended to other rateless block coding schemes such as the
LT codes. Finally, we comment on the extension of our results to the cases of
dependent channels across users and asymmetric channel model.
