R^2. We analyze these curves through the persistent homology groups of a
filtration induced on S^1 by f. In particular, we consider the question whether
these persistent homology groups uniquely characterize f, at least up to
re-parameterizations of S^1. We give a partially positive answer to this
question. More precisely, we prove that f=goh, where h:S^1-> S^1 is a
C^1-diffeomorphism, if and only if the persistent homology groups of sof and
sog coincide, for every s belonging to the group Sigma_2 generated by
reflections in the coordinate axes. Moreover, for a smaller set of generic
functions, we show that f and g are close to each other in the max-norm (up to
re-parameterizations) if and only if, for every s belonging to Sigma_2, the
persistent Betti numbers functions of sof and sog are close to each other, with
respect to a suitable distance.

characterization of the Conrad property for orderings.
  In Chapter 2, we use the new characterization of the Conradian property to
give a classification of groups admitting (only) finitely many Conradian
orderings \S 2.1. Using this classification we deduce a structure theorem for
the space of Conradian orderings \S 2.2. In addition, we are able to give a
structure theorem for the space of left-orderings on a group by studying the
possibility of approximating a given ordering by its conjugates \S 2.3.
  In Chapter 3 we show that, for groups having finitely many Conradian
orderings, having an isolated left-ordering is equivalent to having only
finitely many left-orderings.
  In Chapter 4, we prove that the space of left-orderings of the free group on
$n\geq2$ generators have a dense orbit under the natural action of the free
group on it. This gives a new proof of the fact that the space of
left-orderings of the free group in at least two generators have no isolated

$\efe$. We show that this space contains eight isolated points together with
four canonical copies of the Cantor set.

to improve precision measurement. An interferometer using N independent
particles to measure a parameter X can achieve at best the ""standard quantum
limit"" (SQL) of sensitivity {\delta}X \propto N^{-1/2}. The same interferometer
using N entangled particles can achieve in principle the ""Heisenberg limit""
{\delta}X \propto N^{-1}, using exotic states. Recent theoretical work argues
that interactions among particles may be a valuable resource for quantum
metrology, allowing scaling beyond the Heisenberg limit. Specifically, a
k-particle interaction will produce sensitivity {\delta}X \propto N^{-k} with
appropriate entangled states and {\delta}X \propto N^{-(k-1/2)} even without
entanglement. Here we demonstrate this ""super-Heisenberg"" scaling in a
nonlinear, non-destructive measurement of the magnetisation of an atomic
ensemble. We use fast optical nonlinearities to generate a pairwise
photon-photon interaction (k = 2) while preserving quantum-noise-limited
performance, to produce {\delta}X \propto N^{-3/2}. We observe super-Heisenberg
scaling over two orders of magnitude in N, limited at large N by higher-order
nonlinear effects, in good agreement with theory. For a measurement of limited
duration, super-Heisenberg scaling allows the nonlinear measurement to overtake
in sensitivity a comparable linear measurement with the same number of photons.
In other scenarios, however, higher-order nonlinearities prevent this crossover
from occurring, reflecting the subtle relationship of scaling to sensitivity in
nonlinear systems. This work shows that inter-particle interactions can improve
sensitivity in a quantum-limited measurement, and introduces a fundamentally
new resource for quantum metrology.

study of planetary systems hosting hot Jupiters can provide new observational
constraints to test proposed theories. We focus on systems with F-type
main-sequence stars and find that the recently discovered system CoRoT-11 is
presently the best suited for such a kind of investigation. A classic constant
tidal lag model is applied to reproduce the evolution of the system from a
plausible nearly synchronous state on the ZAMS to the present state, thus
putting constraints on the average modified tidal quality factor <Q'_s> of its
F6V star. Initial conditions with the stellar rotation period longer than the
orbital period of the planet can be excluded on the basis of the presently
observed state in which the star spins faster than the planet orbit. It is
found that <Q'_s> is approximately between 4.0E+06 and 2.0E+07 if the system
started its evolution on the ZAMS close to synchronization with an uncertainty
related to the constant tidal lag hypothesis and the estimated stellar magnetic
braking within a factor of about 5-6. Moreover, we discuss how the present
value of Q'_s can be measured by a timing of the mid-epoch and duration of the
transits as well as of the planetary eclipses to be observed in the infrared
with an accuracy of about 0.5-1 s over a time baseline of about 25 yr. CoRoT-11
is an highly interesting system potentially allowing us a direct measure of the
tidal dissipation in an F-type star as well as the detection of the precession
of the orbital plane of the planet that provides us with an accurate upper
limit for the obliquity of the stellar equator. If the planetary orbit has a
significant eccentricity (e>0.05), it will be possible to detect also the
precession of the line of the apsides and derive information on the Love number
of the planet and its tidal quality factor.

these new objects, we notice that every tropical subvariety in a tropical

tropical variety (possibly with negative weights), and conjecture certain
generalizations of this fact to singular M. The above fact about subvarieties

wellfoundedness or Noetherity, L\""ob's formula, absence of infinite iteration,
absence of divergence and normalisation. The study is based on modal semirings,
which are additively idempotent semirings with forward and backward modal
operators. To model infinite behaviours, idempotent semirings are extended to
divergence semirings, divergence Kleene algebras and omega algebras. The
resulting notions and techniques are used in calculational proofs of classical
theorems of rewriting theory. These applications show that modal semirings are
powerful tools for reasoning algebraically about the finite and infinite
dynamics of programs and transition systems.

these motivic $L-$functions are identical in several cases to $L-$series

with clouds, ecosystems, and radiation, which constitutes a substantial
uncertainty in understanding past and predicting future climate changes. One of
the causes of this large uncertainty is that the size distribution of emitted
dust aerosols is poorly understood. The present study shows that regional and
global circulation models (GCMs) overestimate the emitted fraction of clay
aerosols (< 2 {\mu}m diameter) by a factor of ~2 - 8 relative to measurements.
This discrepancy is resolved by deriving a simple theoretical expression of the
emitted dust size distribution that is in excellent agreement with
measurements. This expression is based on the physics of the scale-invariant
fragmentation of brittle materials, which is shown to be applicable to dust
emission. Because clay aerosols produce a strong radiative cooling, the
overestimation of the clay fraction causes GCMs to also overestimate the
radiative cooling of a given quantity of emitted dust. On local and regional
scales, this affects the magnitude and possibly the sign of the dust radiative
forcing, with implications for numerical weather forecasting and regional
climate predictions in dusty regions. On a global scale, the dust cycle in most
GCMs is tuned to match radiative measurements, such that the overestimation of
the radiative cooling of a given quantity of emitted dust has likely caused
GCMs to underestimate the global dust emission rate. This implies that the
deposition flux of dust and its fertilizing effects on ecosystems may be
substantially larger than thought.

causing a change from a collective to an individual band behavior, due to the
freezing of orbital fluctuations. In this situation the physics is strongly
dependent on individual filling and electronic structure of each band, and
orbital-selective Mott transitions (or even a cascade of such transitions) are
to be expected. More generally a heavy differentiation in the actual degree of
correlation of different bands arises and the system can show both weakly and

crucial difference are memory effects, rapid oscillations much faster than the
heavy neutrino equilibration time. These oscillations strongly suppress the

sensitive probes to study the two and many-body interactions between nucleons

to study in detail the three-nucleon interactions below the pion-production
threshold by exploiting polarized proton and deuteron beams and
large-acceptance detectors. Only since recently, the four-nucleon scattering
process at intermediate energies has been explored. In addition, there is a
focus to collect data in the hyperon-nucleon sector, thereby providing access
to understand the more general baryon-baryon interaction. In this contribution,
some recent results in the few-nucleon sector are discussed together with some
of the preliminary results from a pioneering and exclusive study of the
four-nucleon scattering process. Furthermore, this paper discusses the
experimental activities in the hyperon sector, in particular, the perspectives

theoretical improvements. Unlike in nuclei close to the stability valley, whose

tools including the spatial cross-correlation function and the local density

that the number density of galaxies surrounding fossil systems evolves from
greater than that observed around normal systems at z=0.69, to lower than the
normal systems by z=0.Both fossil and normal systems exhibit an increment in
their otherwise radially declining local density measure (\Delta_5) at
distances of order 2.5r_{vir} from the system centre.We show that this
increment is more noticeable for fossil systems than normal systems and
demonstrate that this difference is linked to the earlier formation epoch of
fossil groups.Despite the importance of the assembly time, we show that the

utilize several nodes to redundantly store sensed data so that when some
storage nodes fail, the sensed data can still be reconstructed. For the same
level of redundancy, erasure coding based approaches are known to require less
data storage space than replication methods.
  To maintain the same level of redundancy when one storage node fails, erasure
coded data can be restored onto some other storage node by having this node
download respective pieces from other live storage nodes. Previous works showed
that the benefits in using erasure coding for robust storage over replication
are made unappealing by the complication in regenerating lost data. More recent
work has, however, shown that the bandwidth for erasure coded data can be
further reduced by proposing Regenerating Coding, making erasure codes again
desirable for robust data storage.
  But none of these works on regenerating coding consider how these codes will
perform for data regeneration in wireless sensor networks. We therefore propose
an analytical model to quantify the network lifetime gains of regenerating
coding over classical schemes. We also propose a distributed algorithm, TROY,
that determines which nodes and routes to use for data regeneration. Our
analytical studies show that for certain topologies, TROY achieves maximum
network lifetime. Our evaluation studies in real sensor network traces show
that TROY achieves near optimal lifetime and performs better than baseline
algorithms.

on loop formulas due to Lin and Zhao by considering loop formulas of elementary
loops only. In this article, we reformulate their definition of an elementary
loop, extend it to disjunctive programs, and study several properties of
elementary loops, including how maximal elementary loops are related to minimal
unfounded sets. The results provide useful insights into the stable model
semantics in terms of elementary loops. For a nondisjunctive program, using a
graph-theoretic characterization of an elementary loop, we show that the
problem of recognizing an elementary loop is tractable. On the other hand, we
show that the corresponding problem is {\sf coNP}-complete for a disjunctive
program. Based on the notion of an elementary loop, we present the class of
Head-Elementary-loop-Free (HEF) programs, which strictly generalizes the class
of Head-Cycle-Free (HCF) programs due to Ben-Eliyahu and Dechter. Like an HCF
program, an HEF program can be turned into an equivalent nondisjunctive program
in polynomial time by shifting head atoms into the body.

not just a feature of classically chaotic systems, but classically integrable

mean level spacing and the running energy in the spectrum. We show that at this
scale level correlations in integrable systems have a universal dependence on
level separation, as well as discuss their exact form at any scale. These
correlations have dramatic consequences, including deviations from Poissonian

oscillations of level number variance as a function of the interval width. We
illustrate our findings on two models - a rectangular infinite well and a

distribution of baryons in galaxies (from a new compilation of galaxy scaling
relations), with constraints on dark halo structure from cosmological
simulations. The principle unknowns are the halo response to galaxy formation
and the stellar initial mass function (IMF). The slopes of the TF and FJ
relations are naturally reproduced for a wide range of halo response and IMFs.
However, models with a universal IMF and universal halo response cannot
simultaneously reproduce the zero points of both the TF and FJ relations. For a
model with a universal Chabrier IMF, LTGs require halo expansion, while ETGs
require halo contraction. A Salpeter IMF is permitted for high mass (sigma >
180 km/s) ETGs, but is inconsistent for intermediate masses, unless
V_circ(R_e)/sigma_e > 1.6. If the IMF is universal and close to Chabrier, we
speculate that the presence of a major merger may be responsible for the
contraction in ETGs while clumpy accreting streams and/or feedback leads to
expansion in LTGs. Alternatively, a recently proposed variation in the IMF
disfavors halo contraction in both types of galaxies. Finally we show that our
models naturally reproduce flat and featureless circular velocity profiles
within the optical regions of galaxies without fine-tuning.

Einstein--Gauss--Bonnet gravity, we present a new class of static solutions
yields a spacetime with a longitudinal nonlinear magnetic field. These
horizonless solutions have no curvature singularity, but have a conic geometry
with a deficit angle $\delta \phi$. In order to have vanishing electromagnetic
field at spatial infinity, we restrict the nonlinearity parameter to $s>1/2$.
Investigation of the energy conditions show that these solutions satisfy the
null, weak and strong energy conditions simultaneously, for $s>1/2$, and the
dominant energy condition is satisfied when $s \in ({1/2,1}]$. In addition, we
look for about the effect of nonlinearity parameter on the energy density and
also deficit angle, and find that these quantities are sensitive with respect
to variation of nonlinearity parameter. We find that for special values of
nonlinearity parameter, two important subclass of solutions, so-called
conformally invariant Maxwell and BTZ-like solutions, with interesting
properties, emerge. Then, we generalize the static solutions to the case of
spinning magnetic solutions and find that, when one or more rotation parameters
are nonzero, the brane has a net electric charge which is proportional to the
magnitude of the rotation parameters. We also use the counterterm method to
compute the conserved quantities of these spacetimes such as mass, angular
momentum, and find that these conserved quantities do not depend on the
nonlinearity parameter.

the largest scales by proper stirring, and argue that stirring with an external

in simulations. We then discuss the special case of buoyancy-driven flows
subject to a spatially-uniform gravitational field. We conclude that a range of

inertial processes and is immune from contributions due to molecular viscosity

polynomial or exponential functions of the evolutionary distance in place of
model-based variances. This has the advantage that unexpected deviations from
additivity can be modeled in a more flexible way. At present, only polynomial
weights have been used. However, a general family of exponential weights is
desirable to compare with polynomial weights and to potentially exploit recent
insights into fast least squares edge length estimation on trees. Here describe
families of weights that are multiplicative on trees, along with measures of
fit of data to tree. It is shown that polynomial, but also multiplicative
weights can approximate model-based variance of evolutionary distances well.
Both models are fitted to evolutionary data from yeast genomes and while the
polynomial weights model fits better, the exponential weights model can fit a
lot better than ordinary least squares. Iterated least squares is evaluated and
is seen to converge quickly and with minimal change in the fit statistics when
the data are in the range expected for the useful evolutionary distances and
simple Markov models of character change. In summary, both polynomial and
exponential weighted least squares work well and justify further investment
into developing the fastest possible algorithms for evaluating evolutionary
trees.

  Aims. We take advantage of this system offering the opportunity to determine
the set of fundamental parameters (masses, luminosities, and radii) of three
coeval stars with sufficient precision to test models of stellar evolution.
  Methods. Extensive high-resolution spectroscopy is analyzed by the broadening
function technique to provide the first spectroscopic orbit of the eclipsing
pair. Simultaneous analysis of the spectroscopic data and the SMEI satellite
light curve is performed to provide astrophysical parameters for the
components. We use a modified Roche model assuming an eccentric orbit and
asynchronous rotation.
  Results. The observations show that components of the eclipsing pair rotate
at about two-thirds of the break-up velocity, which excludes any chemical
peculiarity and results in a non-uniform surface brightness. Although the inner
orbit is eccentric, no apsidal motion is seen during the SMEI photometric
observations. For the inner orbit, the orbital parameters are eccentricity e =
0.29, longitude of the periastron passage omega = 109 degrees, and inclination
89.0 degrees.
  Conclusions. Component's masses MAa = 2.53+/-0.11 Msun, MAb = 2.37+/-0.10
Msun and MB = 1.5 Msun combined with inferred radii of Aa and Ab components
indicate that the eclipsing pair has already left the Main sequence and the

galaxies, we study the efficiency and completeness of halo detections from weak
lensing convergence maps. Particularly, with numerical simulations, we compare
the Gaussian filter with the so called MRLens treatment based on the
modification of the Maximum Entropy Method. For a pure noise field without
lensing signals, a Gaussian smoothing results a residual noise field that is
approximately Gaussian in statistics if a large enough number of galaxies are
included in the smoothing window. On the other hand, the noise field after the
MRLens treatment is significantly non-Gaussian, resulting complications in
characterizing the noise effects. Considering weak-lensing cluster detections,
although the MRLens treatment effectively deletes false peaks arising from
noise, it removes the real peaks heavily due to its inability to distinguish
real signals with relatively low amplitudes from noise in its restoration
process. The higher the noise level is, the larger the removal effects are for
the real peaks. For a survey with a source density n_g~30 arcmin^(2), the
number of peaks found in an area of 3x3 sq.deg after MRLens filtering is only
~50 for the detection threshold kappa=0.02, while the number of halos with
M>5x10^{13} M_{\odot} and with redshift z<=2 in the same area is expected to be
~530. For the Gaussian smoothing treatment, the number of detections is ~260,
much larger than that of the MRLens. The Gaussianity of the noise statistics in
the Gaussian smoothing case adds further advantages for this method to
circumvent the problem of the relatively low efficiency in weak-lensing cluster
detections. Therefore, in studies aiming to construct large cluster samples
from weak-lensing surveys, the Gaussian smoothing method performs significantly
better than the MRLens.

of communication systems which, in order to provide both reliability and
security, first encode the data before encrypting it, which is referred to as
the encoding-encryption paradigm. The considered systems employ
error-correction coding for reliability, a stream cipher for encryption, and
homophonic coding to enhance the protection of the key used in the stream
cipher, on which relies the security of all the system transmissions. This
paper presents a security evaluation of such systems from a computational
complexity point of view, which serves as a source for establishing dedicated
homophonic code design criteria. The security evaluation shows that the
computational complexity of recovering the secret key, given all the
information an attacker could gather during passive attacks he can mount, is
lower bounded by the complexity of the related LPN (Learning Parity in Noise)
problem in both the average and worst case. This gives guidelines to construct
a dedicated homophonic encoder which maximizes the complexity of the underlying
LPN problem for a given encoding overhead. Finally, this paper proposes a
generic homophonic coding strategy that fulfills the proposed design criteria
and thus both enhances security while minimizing the induced overhead.

intrinsically disordered proteins. These proteins are characterized by an
ensemble of high-flexible interchangeable conformations and therefore they can
interact with many targets without requiring pre-existing stereo-chemical
complementarity. It has been suggested that intrinsically disordered proteins
are frequent in proteomes and disorder is widespread also in structured
proteins. However, several studies raise some doubt about these views. It this
paper we estimate the frequency of intrinsically disordered proteins in several
living organisms by using the ratio S between the likelihood, for a protein
sequence, of being composed mainly by order-promoting or disorder-promoting
residues. We scan several proteomes from Archaea, Bacteria and Eukarya. We find
the following figures: 1.63% for Archaea, 3.91% for Bacteria, 16.35% for
Eukarya. The frequencies we found can be considered an upper bound to the real
frequency of intrinsically disordered proteins in proteomes. Our estimates are
lower than those previously reported in several studies. A scanning of proteins
in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) searching for segments of non-observed residues
reveals that segments of non-observed residues longer than 30 amino acids, are
rare. Our observations support the idea that the spread of the unfoldome has
been often overestimated. If we exclude some exceptions, the structure-function
paradigm is generally valid and pre-existing stereo-chemical complementarity
among structures remains an important requisite for interactions between
biological macromolecules.

disorder-promoting residues (DPR proteins); iii) belonging to a twilight zone

internal free energies, amino acid compositions and protein lengths. Internal
free energy of 96% of the proteins analyzed ranges from -2 to -6.5 kJ/mol/res.
We found many DPR and OPR proteins with the same relative thermal stability.
Only OPR proteins with internal energy between -4 and -6.5 kJ/mol/res are
observed to have chains longer than 200 residues, with a high de-hydration
energy compensated by the hydrophobic effect. DPR and TZ proteins are shorter
than 200 residues and they have an internal energy above -4 kJ/mol/res, with a
few exceptions among TZ proteins. Hydrogen-bonds play an important role in the
stabilization of these DPR folds, often higher than contact energy. The new
parameterization of internal free energy let emerge a geography of thermal
stabilities of PDB structures. Amino acid composition per se is not sufficient
to determine the stability of protein folds, since. DPR and TZ proteins
generally have a relatively high internal free energy, and they are stabilized
by hydrogen-bonds. Long DPR proteins are not observed in the PDB, because their
low hydrophobicity cannot compensate the high de-hydration energy necessary to
accommodate residues within a highly packed globular fold.

necessity of an extension are compelling. An attractive option is provided by
Two-Higgs-Doublet models, due to their simplicity and them being the low-energy
limit of some more complete theories. In the most general version of the model,
the fermionic couplings of the neutral scalars are non-diagonal in flavour and,
therefore, generate unwanted flavour-changing neutral-current phenomena.
Different ways to suppress FCNCs have been developed, giving rise to a variety
of specific implementations of the 2HDM. Three of these are discussed in this
talk, comparing their phenomenological influence in flavour observables: The
use of a discrete Z2-symmetry, an expansion around this limit in a minimal
flavour violation scenario assuming the decoupling limit, and the Aligned
Two-Higgs-Doublet Model. All of these result in the absence of tree-level
flavour-changing neutral currents. Their different phenomenological
consequences are demonstrated for a selection of observables, namely (semi-)
leptonic decays, B->X_s gamma and mixing in the B0_d,s-systems.

least a factor of ten above a critical altitude. Here we analyze the profile in
the deep core of the NaI doublet line from HST and high-resolution ground-based
spectra to further constrain the vertical structure of the HD209458b
atmosphere. With a wavelength-dependent cross section that spans more than 5
orders of magnitude, we use the absorption signature of the NaI doublet as an
atmospheric probe. The NaI transmission features are shown to sample the
atmosphere of HD209458b over an altitude range of more than 6500km,
corresponding to a pressure range of 14 scale heights spanning 1 millibar to
1e-9 bar pressures. By comparing the observations with a multi-layer model in
which temperature is a free parameter at the resolution of the atmospheric
scale height, we constrain the temperature vertical profile and variations in
the Na abundance in the upper part of the atmosphere of HD209458b. We find a
rise in temperature above the drop in sodium abundance at the 3mbar level. We
also identify an isothermal atmospheric layer at 1500+/-100K spanning almost 6
scale heights in altitude, from 1e-5 to 1e-7 bar. Above this layer, the
temperature rises again to 2500(+1500/-1000)K at 1e-9 bar, indicating the
presence of a thermosphere. The resulting temperature-pressure (T-P) profile
agrees with the Na condensation scenario at the 3 mbar level, with a possible
signature of sodium ionization at higher altitudes, near the 3e-5 bar level.
Our T-P profile is found to be in good agreement with the profiles obtained
with aeronomical models including hydrodynamic escape.

rarely have prominent star formation. We found that five out of 8,812 BCGs are
E+A (i.e. post-starburst) galaxies, having the H$\delta$~absorption line with
an equivalent width $>2.5\AA$ and no distinct emission lines in [O II] and
H$\alpha$. The E+A features we identified from the BCGs for the first time are
not as significant as those in general galaxies, indicating that historically
the star formation were not very violent.

  Concept: Hidden Feature Attachment",,,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we introduce a method for extending binary qualitative
direction calculi with adjustable granularity like OPRAm or the star calculus
with a granular distance concept. This method is similar to the concept of
extending points with an internal reference direction to get oriented points
which are the basic entities in the OPRAm calculus. Even if the spatial objects
are from a geometrical point of view infinitesimal small points locally
available reference measures are attached. In the case of OPRAm, a reference
direction is attached. The same principle works also with local reference
distances which are called elevations. The principle of attaching references
features to a point is called hidden feature attachment.

In this paper we set out to
investigate how networks of varying connectivity patterns respond to different
link failure schemes in terms of connectivity, clustering coefficient and
shortest path lengths. We then propose a measure, which we call the
vulnerability of a network, for evaluating the extent of the damage these
failures can cause. Accepting the disconnections of node pairs as a damage
indicator, vulnerability simply represents how quickly the failure of the
critical links cause the network to undergo a specified damage extent.
Analyzing the vulnerabilities under varying damage specifications shows that
scale free networks are relatively more vulnerable for small failures, but more
efficient; whereas Erd\""os-R\'enyi networks are the least vulnerable despite
lacking any clustered structure.

which turns English pronunciation into a precise and unambiguous process. The
annotations are defined and located in such a way that the original English
text is not altered (not even a letter), thus allowing for a consistent reading
and learning of the English language with and without annotations. The
annotations are based on a set of general rules that make the frequency of
annotations not dramatically high. This makes the reader easily associate
annotations with exceptions, and makes it possible to shape, internalise and
consolidate some rules for the English language which otherwise are weakened by
the enormous amount of exceptions in English pronunciation. The advantages of
this annotation system are manifold. Any existing text can be annotated without
a significant increase in size. This means that we can get an annotated version
of any document or book with the same number of pages and fontsize. Since no
letter is affected, the text can be perfectly read by a person who does not
know the annotation rules, since annotations can be simply ignored. The
annotations are based on a set of rules which can be progressively learned and
recognised, even in cases where the reader has no access or time to read the
rules. This means that a reader can understand most of the annotations after
reading a few pages of Annotated English, and can take advantage from that
knowledge for any other annotated document she may read in the future.

dimensional Schwarzschild black hole spacetimes and prove robust nondegenerate
energy decay estimates that are in principle required in a nonlinear stability
problem. More precisely, it is shown that for solutions to the wave equation
\Box_g\phi=0 on the domain of outer communications of the Schwarzschild
spacetime manifold (M^n_m, g) (where n >= 3 is the spatial dimension, and m > 0
is the mass of the black hole) the associated energy flux E[\phi](\Sigma_\tau)
through a foliation of hypersurfaces (\Sigma_\tau) (terminating at future null
infinity and to the future of the bifurcation sphere) decays,
E[\phi](\Sigma_\tau) <= CD/\tau^2, where C is a constant only depending on n
and m, and D < \infty is a suitable higher order initial energy on \Sigma_0;
moreover we improve the decay rate for the first order energy to
E[\partial_t\phi](\Sigma_\tau^R) <= CD/\tau^(4-2\delta) for any \delta > 0
where \Sigma_\tau^R denotes the hypersurface (\Sigma_\tau) truncated at an
arbitrarily large fixed radius R < \infty provided the higher order energy
D_\delta on \Sigma_0 is finite. We conclude our paper by interpolating between
these two results to obtain the pointwise estimate |\phi|_{\Sigma_\tau^R} <= (C
D'_\delta) / \tau^(3/2-\delta). In this work we follow the new physical-space
approach to decay for the wave equation of Dafermos and Rodnianski.

without knowledge of the ground state of hidden sectors that are
gravitationally coupled to the inflaton. If the hidden sector breaks
supersymmetry independently, its fields cannot be stabilized during
cosmological evolution of the inflaton. We show that both the subsequent
dynamical mixing between sectors as well as the lightest mass of the hidden
sector are set by the scale of supersymmetry breaking in the hidden sector. The
true cosmological eta-parameter arises from a linear combination of the
lightest mode of the hidden sector with the inflaton. Generically, either the
true eta deviates considerably from the na\""ive eta implied by the inflaton
sector alone, or one has to consider a multifield model. Only if the lightest
mass in the hidden sector is much larger than the inflaton mass and if the
inflaton mass is much larger than the scale of hidden sector supersymmetry
breaking, is the effect of the hidden sector on the slow-roll dynamics of the
inflaton negligible.

double-phase time projection chamber designed for direct Dark Matter searches.
Such a device allows to explore the low energy frontier in LAr with a charge
imaging detector. The ionization charge is extracted from the liquid into the
gas phase and there amplified by the use of a Large Electron Multiplier in
order to reduce the detection threshold. Direct detection of the ionization
charge with fine spatial granularity, combined with a measurement of the
amplitude and time evolution of the associated primary scintillation light,
provide powerful tools for the identification of WIMP interactions against the
background due to electrons, photons and possibly neutrons if scattering more
than once. A one ton LAr detector is presently installed on surface at CERN to
fully test all functionalities and it will be soon moved to an underground
location. We will emphasize here the lessons learned from such a device for the
design of a large LAr TPC for neutrino oscillation, proton decay and
astrophysical neutrinos searches.

collapse of a uniform density dust, we directly show that the density of the
dust $\rho=0$ even when its proper number density $n$ would be assumed to be
finite! The physical reason behind this exact result can be traced back to the
observation of Arnowitt et al. that the gravitational mass of a neutral point
particle is zero: $m=0$ (PRL, 4, 375, 1960). And since, a dust is a mere
collection of {\em neutral point particles, unlike a continuous hydrodynamic
fluid}, its density $\rho = m n=0$. It is nonetheless found that for $k=-1$, a
homogeneous dust can collapse and expand special relativistically in the
fashion of a Milne universe. Thus, in reality, general relativistic homogeneous
dust collapse does not lead to the formation of any black hole in conformity of
many previous studies (Logunov, Mestverishvili, Kiselev, Phys.Part.Nucl. 37,
317, 2006; Kisevev, Logunov & Mestvirishvili, Theor. Math. Phys., 164, 972,
2010; Mitra, J. Math. Phys. 50, 042502, 2009; Suggett, J. Phys. A, 12, 375
1979).
  Interestingly, this result is in agreement with the intuition of Oppenheimer
& Snyder (Phys. Rev. 56, p.456, 1939) too:
  ""Physically such a singularity would mean that the expressions used for the
energy-momentum tensor does not take into account some essential physical fact
which would really smooth the singularity out. Further, a star in its early
stages of development would not possess a singular density or pressure, it is
impossible for a singularity to develop in a finite time.""
