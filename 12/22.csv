inspects the crossover between the disciplines of modeling and simulation,
service-orientation, and software/systems engineering. Based on the model, we
present a comprehensive survey on several classical service-oriented simulation
frameworks, including formalism-based, model-driven, interoperability protocol

constants on epitaxial conditions. From thorough structural and magnetic
investigations, our findings indicate a more complex relationship between
strain and magnetic properties in MnAs films than a simple stretch/compression
of the unit cell axes. While a small increase is seen in the anisotropy
constants the enhancement of the magnetic moment at saturation is significant.
X-ray magnetic circular dichroism results show a behavior of the spin- and
orbital-moment which is consistent with a structural transition at $T_c$. In
particular, we find that the ratio of the orbital to spin moment shows a marked
increase in the coexistence region of the ferromagnetic $\alpha$- and
paramagnetic $\beta$-phases, a result that is well in accord with the observed
increase of the $c/a$-ratio in the same temperature region. The \textit{ab

more sensitive towards change in in-plane axis as compared to a change of the
out-of-plane axis, which is explained by the analysis of band structures. The

present a constructive derivation of the fermionic character at level k based

sequence of nonlocal (formal) operators acting on the vacuum ground-state path.
Within this framework, the key step is the construction of the level-k operator
sequences out of those at level-1 by the action of a new type of operators.
These actions of operators on operators turn out to have a path interpretation:
these paths are precisely the finitized RSOS paths related to the unitary
minimal models M(k+1,k+2). We thus unravel -- at the level of the path
representation of the states --, a direct factorization into a k=1 spinon part
times a RSOS factor. It is also pointed out that since there are two fermionic
forms describing these finite RSOS paths, the resulting fermionic su(2)_k
characters arise in two versions. Finally, the relation between the present
construction and the Nagoya spectral decomposition of the path space is
sketched.

  of GWAS data","Revision",,,,"q-bio.QM q-bio.GN q-bio.MN stat.AP stat.CO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/","  Genome-wide association studies have become increasingly common due to
advances in technology and have permitted the identification of differences in
single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) alleles that are associated with diseases.
However, while typical GWAS analysis techniques treat markers individually,
complex diseases are unlikely to have a single causative gene. There is thus a
pressing need for multi-SNP analysis methods that can reveal system-level
differences in cases and controls. Here, we present a novel multi-SNP GWAS
analysis method called Pathways of Distinction Analysis (PoDA). The method uses
GWAS data and known pathway-gene and gene-SNP associations to identify pathways
that permit, ideally, the distinction of cases from controls. The technique is
based upon the hypothesis that if a pathway is related to disease risk, cases
will appear more similar to other cases than to controls for the SNPs
associated with that pathway. By systematically applying the method to all
pathways of potential interest, we can identify those for which the hypothesis
holds true, i.e., pathways containing SNPs for which the samples exhibit
greater within-class similarity than across classes. Importantly, PoDA improves
on existing single-SNP and SNP-set enrichment analyses in that it does not
require the SNPs in a pathway to exhibit independent main effects. This permits
PoDA to reveal pathways in which epistatic interactions drives risk. In this
paper, we detail the PoDA method and apply it to two GWA studies: one of breast
cancer, and the other of liver cancer. The results obtained strongly suggest
that there exist pathway-wide genomic differences that contribute to disease
susceptibility. PoDA thus provides an analytical tool that is complementary to
existing techniques and has the power to enrich our understanding of disease
genomics at the systems-level.

  The new quantum algorithm bridges the gap between QPE algorithms based on QFT

nth bit, Kitaev's original approach does not require any controlled phase shift
operator. In contrast, QPE algorithms based on QFT or approximate QFT require
controlled phase shift operators with precision of at least Pi/2n. The new
approach fills the gap and requires only arbitrary constant-precision

unification has been investigated for many years. Although electromagnetism is
formulated successfully by quantum field theory, this paper proposes a simple
approach to describe the electromagnetism from the macroscopic perspective of
general relativity. The hypothesis is based on two charged particles that cause
disturbance energy sufficient to disrupt the space-time and explain
approximately Maxwell's equations. Therefore, with such this simple idea, we
suggest the possibility that the geometric relationship between

quasars for which XMM-Newton EPIC spectra are available. Comparing the

of the studied PG quasars require a large hydrogen column density absorber,
requiring these quasars to be close to or Compton-thick. Such a large column
density can be directly excluded for PG 0050+124, for which a high-resolution
RGS spectrum exists. Further constraint on the column density for a further 19
out of the 21 studied PG quasars comes from the EPIC spectrum characteristics
such as hard X-ray power-law photon index and the equivalent width of the Fe
Kalpha line; and the small equivalent width of the C IV absorber present in UV
spectra. For 2 sources: PG 1001+054 and PG 1411+442 we cannot exclude that they
are indeed Compton-thick, and the radio and X-ray luminosity are due to a wind
originating close to the super-massive black hole. We conclude that for 20 out

work. Two epochs of eEVN observations at 5.0 GHz, taken in 2008, revealed the
presence of a rich cluster of compact radio emitting sources in the central 150
pc of the nuclear starburst in Arp 299A. The large brightness temperatures
observed for the compact sources indicate a non-thermal origin for the observed
radio emission, implying that most, if not all, of those sources were young
radio supernovae (RSNe) and supernova remnants (SNRs). More recently,
contemporaneous EVN observations at 1.7 and 5.0 GHz taken in 2009 have allowed
us to shed light on the compact radio emission of the parsec-scale structure in
the nucleus of Arp 299-A. Namely, our EVN observations have shown that one of
the compact VLBI sources, A1, previously detected at 5.0 GHz, has a flat
spectrum between 1.7 and 5.0 GHz and is the brightest source at both
frequencies. The morphology, radio luminosity, spectral index and ratio of
radio-to-X-ray emission of the A1-A5 region allowed us to identify A1-A5 with
long-sought AGN in Arp 299-A. This finding may suggest that both starburst and
AGN are frequently associated phenomena in mergers. Finally, we also note that
component A0, identified as a young RSN, exploded at the mere distance of two
parsecs from the putative AGN in Arp 299-A, which makes this supernova one of
the closest to a central supermassive black hole ever detected.

although is a problem of tremendous current interest, with wide practical
value. It is well-accepted that the classical nucleation theory (CNT) fails to
provide a qualitative picture and gives incorrect quantitative values for such
quantities as activation free energy barrier and supersaturation dependence of
nucleation rate, especially at large metastability. In this article, we present
a powerful alternative formalism to treat nucleation at large supersaturation.
This formalism goes over to the classical picture at small supersaturation
where CNT is expected to be valid. The new theory is based on an extended set
of order parameters in terms of k-th largest liquid-like clusters where k=1 is
the largest cluster in the system, k=2 is the second largest cluster and so on.
We derive an analytic expression for the free energy of formation of the k-th
largest cluster which shows that at large metastability the barrier of growth
for the few largest liquid-like clusters disappear, the nucleation becomes
collective and the approach to the critical size occurs by barrierless
diffusion in the cluster size space. The expression for the rate of barrier
crossing predicts a weaker supersaturation dependence than that of CNT at large
metastability. Such a cross-over behavior has indeed been observed in recent
experiments but eluded an explanation till now. In order to understand the
large numerical difference between simulation predictions and experimental
results, we carried out a study of the dependence on the range of
intermolecular interaction of both the surface tension of an equilibrium planar
gas-liquid interface and the free energy barrier of nucleation. Both are found
to depend significantly on the range of interaction for a Lennard-Jones
potential, both in two and three dimensions.

pair maps, separating twists, and simply intersecting pair maps (SIP-maps).
Historically the first two types of elements have been the focus of the
literature on I(S_g), while SIP-maps have received relatively little attention
until recently, due to an infinite presentation of I(S_g) introduced by Andrew
Putman that uses all three types of elements. We will give a topological
characterization of the image of an SIP-map under the Johnson homomorphism and
Birman-Craggs-Johnson homomorphism. We will also classify which SIP-maps are in
the kernel of these homomorphisms. Then we will look at the subgroup generated
by all SIP-maps, SIP(S_g), and show it is an infinite index subgroup of I(S_g).

superspace. For example, it would be natural to assume that all the physically
important composite operators can be made by combining superfields and
superspace derivatives. But even for the simplest possible, free, massless and
unbroken SUSY theory in 3+1 dimensions, this is not true. This paper shows that
there is a large set of physically important composite operators in the SSM
that require explicit factors of the Grassmann odd `$\theta$' parameters of
superspace. These explicitly break superspace invariance. These composite
operators will be called `Outfields', because they are intrinsically `outside'
of superspace. It is not possible to write the Outfields using only superfields
and superspace derivatives. The Outfields can be found in the BRST cohomology
space of the theory. The calculation of the BRST cohomology space for these
theories is performed in this paper using a spectral sequence analysis,
starting with the free massless theory, and then adding interactions, and then
masses.

of the chiral phase transition in the parameter space of magnetic field

synchrotron point sources, and clustered dusty point sources. In addition to
measuring the power spectrum of dusty galaxies at high signal-to-noise, the
data primarily constrain a linear combination of the kSZ and tSZ anisotropy
contributions at $150\,$GHz and $\ell=3000$: $D^{tSZ}_{3000} +
0.5\,D^{kSZ}_{3000} = 4.5\pm 1.0 \,\mu{\rm K}^2$. The 95% confidence upper
limits on secondary anisotropy power are $D^{tSZ}_{3000} < 5.3\,\mu{\rm K}^2$
and $D^{kSZ}_{3000} < 6.5\,\mu{\rm K}^2$. We also consider the potential
correlation of dusty and tSZ sources, and find it incapable of relaxing the tSZ
upper limit. These results increase the significance of the lower than expected
tSZ amplitude previously determined from SPT power spectrum measurements. We
find that models including non-thermal pressure support in groups and clusters
predict tSZ power in better agreement with the SPT data. Combining the tSZ
power measurement with primary CMB data halves the statistical uncertainty on
$\sigma_8$. However, the preferred value of $\sigma_8$ varies significantly
between tSZ models. Improved constraints on cosmological parameters from tSZ
power spectrum measurements require continued progress in the modeling of the

5% for a Higgs of mass 100-200 GeV, confirming the result obtained previously
in the literature. For the production of a light Higgs boson in the MSSM the
Standard Model result is recovered in the decoupling limit, while the loop
contributions from superpartners to the production of neutral MSSM Higgs bosons
can give rise to corrections in excess of 10% away from the decoupling region.

well-hidden, `Outfields'. These Outfields are composite operators that violate
superspace invariance, but in a special way. A new mechanism for SUSY breaking
arises from the Outfields, for a special non-minimal version of the SSM, which
will be called the CSSM. The CSSM has right neutrinos and a Higgs singlet,
which we call J, in addition to the usual SSM. This breaking of SUSY cannot be
avoided, because it arises from the local BRST cohomology of the theory, which
is also the origin of the Outfields. It can also be seen that the Weak SU(2)
group, and the well-known remarkable set of doublets and singlets for the
Quarks, Leptons and Higgs, have a raison d'etre which relates to this
mechanism. The SUSY breaking here depends on only one parameter, which is the
VEV that breaks SU(2) X U(1) to U(1). SUSY itself is not spontaneously broken
here, so the vacuum energy remains zero after SUSY breaking. The resulting
predictions for SUSY breaking are very constrained by the model.

mass-density space, one with hot Jupiters with a wide range of orbital periods
(0.8--114 days) and a narrow range of planet radii (1.2 +- 0.2 R_J); and
another one with a mixture of super-Earths, hot Neptunes and hot Jupiters,
exhibiting a surprisingly narrow period distribution (3.7 +- 0.8 days). These
two clusters follow different distributions in the period-radius parameter
plane. The branch of sub-Jupiter mass exoplanets is censored by the orbital
period at large-radii: no planets with mass between 0.02--0.8 M_J or with
radius between 0.25--1.0 R_J are known with P_orb<2.5 days. This clustering is
not predicted by current theories of planet formation and evolution that we
also review briefly.

  The selection of the pairs of suitable micro-windows is based on the

redshift z=0.16 and z=0.36, were serendipitously observed by Swift-XRT. We
accurately quantify the temperature uncertainties, with particular focus on the
impact of the background scatter (both instrumental and cosmic). We extrapolate
these results and simulate a deep observation of the external region of Abell
1795 which is assumed here as a case study. In particular we calculate the
expected uncertainties in the temperature measurement as far as r200. We find
that, with a fairly deep observation (300 ks), the Swift XRT would be able to
measure the ICM temperature profiles in the external regions as far as the
virial radius, significantly improving the best accuracy among the previous
measurements. This can be achieved thanks to the unprecedented combination of
good PSF over the full field of view and very accurate control of the
instrumental background. Somehow unexpectedly we conclude that, among currently
operating telescope, the Swift-XRT is the only potentially able to improve the
current accuracy in plasma temperature measurement at the edges of the cluster
potential. This will be true until a newgeneration of low-background and large
field of view telescopes, aimed to the study of galaxy clusters, will operate.
These observations would be of great importance in developing the observing
strategy for suchmissions.

such as the QCD- or electroweak- transitions. The magnitude of the remainder of
such fields at the present epoch crucially depends on the exponent $n$ of their
(initially super-Hubble) large-scale tail, i.e. B(lambda) ~ lambda^(-n). It has
been claimed that causality requires n=5/2, contrary to much earlier claims of
n=3/2. Here we analyze this question in detail. First, we note that contrary to
current belief, the large-scale magnetic field tail is not established at the
phase transition itself, but rather continuoulsy evolves up to the present
epoch. Neglecting turbulent flows we find n=7/2, i.e. very strongly suppressed
large-scale fields. However, in the inevitable presence of turbulent flows we
find that the large-scale magnetic field tail has sufficient time to evolve to
that of the fluid turbulence. For white noise fluid turbulence this yields
n=3/2 up to a certain scale and n=5/2 beyond for the magnetic field spectrum.
This picture is also not changed when primordial viscosity and fluid flow
dissipation is taken into account. Appreciable primordial magnetic fields
originating from cosmic phase transitions seem thus possible.

show experimentally that nematodes confined by a thin liquid film come into

stronger than the force that may be exerted by the nematodes' muscles. We
believe this to be the first demonstration of the ""Cheerios effect"" acting on a
living organism. However, we find that being grouped together does not
significantly alter the body stroke and kinematic performance of the nematode:
there are no statistically significant changes of the Strouhal number and the
ratio of amplitude to wavelength when aggregated. This result implies that
nematodes gain neither a mechanical advantage nor disadvantage by being grouped
together; the capillary force merely draws and keeps them together.

models of black hole hard states. Three models fit the spectra well: coronae
with thermal or mixed thermal/non-thermal electron populations, and jets. All
three models require a soft component that we fit with a low temperature disk
spectrum with an inner radius of only a few tens of GM/c^2. All three models
also agree that the known spectral break at 10\,keV is not solely due to the
presence of reflection, but each gives a different underlying explanation for
the augmentation of this break. Thus whereas all three models require that
there is a relativistically broadened Fe line, the strength and inner radius of
such a line is dependent upon the specific model, {thus making premature

strong flux variations up to a factor of ~4 within one month. We can
disentangle the intrinsic quasar variability from flux variations due to
gravitational microlensing by looking at the flux ratios of the individual
quasar images. Doing this, we find evidence for microlensing in image A. In
particular, the time-sequence of the flux ratio A/B in the X-ray regime
correlates with the corresponding sequence in the optical monitoring by OGLE in
the V-band. The amplitudes in the X-ray light curve are larger. For the most
prominent peak, the increase of the X-ray ratio A/B is larger by a factor ~1.6

technifermions and quarks and leptons that give rise to quark and lepton masses
at the TeV scale. Obtaining a sufficiently large top quark mass requires strong
dynamics at the supersymmetry breaking scale in both the top and technicolor
sectors. This is natural if the theory above the supersymmetry breaking also
has strong conformal dynamics. We present two models in which the strong top
dynamics is realized in different ways. In both models, constraints from
flavor-changing effects can be easily satisfied. The effective theory below the
supersymmetry breaking scale is minimal conformal technicolor with an
additional light technicolor gaugino. We argue that this light gaugino is a

binary asteroids recently discovered might be EEBs because of the high
separation between their components (~100 > a/Rp > ~20). However, the rotation
periods of four out of the six objects measured by our group and others and
presented here show that these suspected EEBs have fast rotation rates of 2.5
to 4 hours. Because of the small size of the components of these binary
asteroids, linked with this fast spinning, we conclude that the
rotational-fission mechanism, which is a result of the thermal YORP effect, is
the most likely formation scenario. Moreover, scaling the YORP effect for these
objects shows that its timescale is shorter than the estimated ages of the
three relevant Hirayama families hosting these binary asteroids. Therefore,
only the largest (D~19 km) suspected asteroid, (317) Roxane, could be, in fact,
the only known EEB. In addition, our results confirm the triple nature of

the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation for scalar and tensor modes, as well as imposes
the boundary conditions at a finite conformal time. As an example, we employ a
fitting function, and compute the spectral index, along with its running, for a

galaxy groups, in particular fossil groups, e.g. large luminosity gap, in an
analogy with the same in a cosmological simulation. We use spectroscopic legacy
data of seventh data release (DR7) of SDSS, to extract a volume limited sample
of galaxy groups utilizing modified friends-of-friends (mFoF) algorithm.
Attention is paid to galaxy groups with the brightest group galaxy (BGG) more
luminous than \Mr = -22. An initial sample of 620 groups in which 109 optical
fossil groups, where the luminosity gap exceeds 2 magnitude, were identified.
We compare the statistics of the luminosity gap in galaxy groups at low mass
range from the SDSS with the same in the Millennium simulations where galaxies
are modeled semi-analytically. We show that the BGGs residing in galaxy groups
with large luminosity gap, i.e. fossil groups, are on average brighter and live
in lower mass halos with respect to their counter parts in non-fossil systems.
Although low mass galaxy groups are thought to have recently formed, we show
that in galaxy groups with 15 galaxies brighter than $M_r\ge -19.5$,
evolutionary process are most likely to be responsible for the large luminosity
gap. We also examine a new probe of finding fossil group. In addition we extend
the recently introduced observational probe based on the luminosity gap, the
butterfly diagram, to galaxy groups and study the probe as a function of halo
mass. This probe can, in conjunction with the luminosity function, help to fine
tune the semi-analytic models of galaxies employed in the cosmological

the possibility of different correlation function ratios, is contrasted with

measurements of SHD in a system of air-driven granular beads, as a function of
both density and effective temperature. On approach to jamming, the dynamics
become progressively slower and more spatially heterogeneous. The rapid growth
of dynamical time and length scales characterizing the heterogeneities can be
described both by mode-coupling theory and the Vogel-Tammann-Fulcher (VTF)
equation, in analogy with glass-forming liquids. The value of the control
variable at the VTF transition coincides with point-J, the random close-packed

information on compact stars and their internal composition. Oscillations of
the star can reduce the rotational energy via the emission of gravitational
waves. In particular unstable oscillation modes, like r-modes, are relevant
since their amplitude becomes large and can lead to a fast spin-down of young
stars if they are saturated by a non-linear saturation mechanism. We present a
novel mechanism based on the pronounced large-amplitude enhancement of the bulk
viscosity of dense matter. We show that the enhanced damping due to non-linear
bulk viscosity can saturate r-modes of neutron stars at amplitudes appropriate
for an efficient spin-down.

possible size of decoupling effects which occur if the SUSY particles are not

differential geometry and Lie groups, that the kernels obtained as fundamental
solutions of certain partial differential operators generate Lagrange functions
that are uniformly bounded and decay away from their center at an algebraic
rate, and in certain cases, an exponential rate. An immediate corollary is that
the corresponding Lebesgue constants for interpolation as well as for $L_2$
minimization are uniformly bounded with a constant whose only dependence on the
set of data sites is reflected in the mesh ratio, which measures the uniformity
of the data. The kernels considered here include the restricted surface splines

closed-form representations that are computationally implementable. In addition
to obtaining bounded Lebesgue constants in this setting, we also establish a

demands the integration of multiple such ontologies. The goal of ontology
integration is to merge two or more given ontologies in order to provide a
unified view on the input ontologies while maintaining all information coming
from them. We propose a new taxonomy merging algorithm that, given as input two
taxonomies and an equivalence matching between them, can generate an integrated
taxonomy in a fully automatic manner. The approach is target-driven, i.e. we
merge a source taxonomy into the target taxonomy and preserve the structure of
the target ontology as much as possible. We also discuss how to extend the
merge algorithm providing auxiliary information, like additional relationships
between source and target concepts, in order to semantically improve the final
result. The algorithm was implemented in a working prototype and evaluated
using synthetic and real-world scenarios.

one AGN at z=2.2 on the basis of narrow-band excesses and photometric
redshifts. We obtained spectra for seven new objects among them, including one
AGN, and an emission line above 3 sigma is detected from all of them. We have
estimated star formation rates (SFR) and stellar masses (M_star) for individual
galaxies. The average SFR and M_star is 27.8M_solar yr^-1 and 4.0 x
10^10M_solar, respectivly. Their specific star formation rates are inversely
correlated with their stellar masses. Fitting to a Schechter function yields
the H-alpha luminosity function with log L = 42.82, log phi = -2.78 and alpha =
-1.37. The average star formation rate density in the survey volume is
estimated to be 0.31M_solar yr^-1Mpc^-3 according to the Kennicutt relation
between H-alpha luminosity and star formation rate. We compare our H-alpha
emitters at z=2.2 in GOODS-N with narrow-band line emitters in other field and

the star formation activity is reduced rapidly from z=2.5 to z=0.8 in the
cluster environment, while it is only moderately changed in the field
environment. This result suggests that the timescale of galaxy formation is
different among different environments, and the star forming activities in high
density regions eventually overtake those in lower density regions as a
consequence of ""galaxy formation bias"" at high redshifts.

optimization problem, which typically has multiple global optimal solutions. We
then propose a reduced primal-dual algorithm, which is distributed, low in
computational complexity, and probably globally convergent to a global optimal
solution. The performance of the algorithm is studied through a realistic OFDM
simulator. Compared with the previously proposed centralized optimal algorithm,
our algorithm not only significantly reduces the message overhead but also
requires less iterations to converge.

with probability |x_i|^p/||x||_p^p. In SODA 2010, Monemizadeh and Woodruff
showed polylog space upper bounds for approximate Lp-samplers and demonstrated
various applications of them. Very recently, Andoni, Krauthgamer and Onak
improved the upper bounds and gave a O(\epsilon^{-p} log^3 n) space \epsilon
relative error and constant failure rate Lp-sampler for p \in [1,2]. In this
work, we give another such algorithm requiring only O(\epsilon^{-p} log^2 n)
space for p \in (1,2). For p \in (0,1), our space bound is O(\epsilon^{-1}
log^2 n), while for the $p=1$ case we have an O(log(1/\epsilon)\epsilon^{-1}
log^2 n) space algorithm. We also give a O(log^2 n) bits zero relative error
L0-sampler, improving the O(log^3 n) bits algorithm due to Frahling, Indyk and
Sohler.
  As an application of our samplers, we give better upper bounds for the
problem of finding duplicates in data streams. In case the length of the stream
is longer than the alphabet size, L1 sampling gives us an O(log^2 n) space
algorithm, thus improving the previous O(log^3 n) bound due to Gopalan and
Radhakrishnan.
  In the second part of our work, we prove an Omega(log^2 n) lower bound for
sampling from 0, \pm 1 vectors (in this special case, the parameter p is not
relevant for Lp sampling). This matches the space of our sampling algorithms
for constant \epsilon > 0. We also prove tight space lower bounds for the
finding duplicates and heavy hitters problems. We obtain these lower bounds

the accelerated expansion of the Universe. The most direct probe of
acceleration relies on the detailed study of supernovae (SN) of type Ia.
Assuming that these are standardizable candles and that they fairly sample a
homogeneous and isotropic Universe, the evidence for acceleration can be tested
in a model- and calibration-independent way. Various light-curve fitting
procedures have been proposed and tested. While several fitters give consistent
results for the so-called Constitution set, they lead to inconsistent results
for the recently released SDSS SN. Adopting the SALT fitter and relying on the
Union set, cosmic acceleration is detected by a purely kinematic test at 7
sigma when spatial flatness is assumed and at 4 sigma without assumption on the
spatial geometry. A weak point of the described method is the local set of SN
(at z < 0.2), as these SN are essential to anchor the Hubble diagram. These SN
are drawn from a volume much smaller than the Hubble volume and could be
affected by local structure. Without the assumption of homogeneity, there is no
evidence for acceleration, as the effects of acceleration are degenerate with
the effects of inhomogeneities. Unless we sit in the centre of the Universe,
such inhomogeneities can be constrained by SN observations by means of tests of
the isotropy of the Hubble flow.

within a limited broadcast range and thus self-organize into dynamical
vehicular ad hoc networks. For the foreseeable future, however, a direct
connectivity between equipped vehicles in one direction is rarely possible. We
therefore investigate an alternative mode in which messages are stored by relay
vehicles traveling in the opposite direction, and forwarded to vehicles in the
original direction at a later time. The wireless communication consists of two
`transversal' message hops across driving directions. Since direct connectivity
for transversal hops and a successful message transmission to vehicles in the
destination region is only a matter of time, the quality of this IVC strategy
can be described in terms of the distribution function for the total
transmission time. Assuming a Poissonian distance distribution between equipped
vehicles, we derive analytical probability distributions for message
transmission times and related propagation speeds for a deterministic and a
stochastic model of the maximum range of direct communication. By means of
integrated microscopic simulations of communication and bi-directional traffic
flows, we validated the theoretical expectation for multi-lane roadways. We
found little deviation of the analytical result for multi-lane scenarios, but
significant deviations for a single-lane. This can be explained by vehicle
platooning. We demonstrate the efficiency of the transverse hopping mechanism
for a congestion-warning application in a microscopic traffic simulation
scenario. Messages are created on an event-driven basis by equipped vehicles
entering and leaving a traffic jam. This application is operative for
penetration levels as low as 1%.

East model, a special example of a one dimensional oriented kinetically
constrained particle model, when the initial distribution is different from the
reversible one and for times much smaller than the global relaxation time. This
setting has been intensively studied in the physics literature to analyze the
slow dynamics which follows a sudden quench from the liquid to the glass phase.
In the limit of zero temperature (i.e. a vanishing density of vacancies) and
for initial distributions such that the vacancies form a renewal process we
prove that the density of vacancies, the persistence function and the two-time
autocorrelation function behave as staircase functions with several plateaux.
Furthermore the two-time autocorrelation function displays an aging behavior.
We also provide a sharp description of the statistics of the domain length as a
function of time, a domain being the interval between two consecutive
vacancies. When the initial renewal process has finite mean our results confirm
(and generalize) previous findings of the physicists for the restricted case of
a product Bernoulli measure. However we show that a different behavior appears
when the initial domain distribution is in the attraction domain of a
$\alpha$-stable law. All the above results actually follow from a more general
result which says that the low temperature dynamics of the East model is very
well described by that of a certain hierarchical coalescence process, a
probabilistic object which can be viewed as a hierarchical sequence of suitably
linked coalescence processes and whose asymptotic behavior has been recently
studied in [14].

nuclei (A>130) and the weak r-process which correspond to the lighter heavy
nuclei (A<130). In this work, we present nucleosynthesis studies based on
trajectories of hydrodynamical simulations for core-collapse supernovae and
their subsequent neutrino-driven winds. We show that the weak r-process
elements can be produced in neutrino-driven winds and we relate their
abundances to the neutrino emission from the nascent neutron star. Based on the
latest hydrodynamical simulations, heavy r-process elements cannot be
synthesized in the neutrino-driven winds. However, by artificially increasing
the wind entropy, elements up to A=195 can be made. In this way one can mimic
the general behavior of an ejecta where the r-process occurs. We use this to
study the impact of the nuclear physics input (nuclear masses, neutron capture
cross sections, and beta-delayed neutron emission) and of the long-time

is rather comprehensive, very interesting and useful as a teaching tool, it can
be somewhat misleading if not taken within its appropriate context. As a matter
of fact, the evolution to equilibrium involves two phases, a faster one leading
to the equalization of pressures, and a slower one bringing the system to
identical temperatures. Although Gislason addresses only the first process, we
note that the final state after the second phase, the evolution to equal

found to depend strongly on the range of the interaction potential. Actually,
the entire free energy surface, F(n), where n is the size of the liquid-like
cluster, shows this dependence. The evidences and the reasons for this strong
dependence are as follows. (i) The surface tension increases dramatically on

stationary point processes. Let each point of some initial stationary point
process in $\R^n$ give rise to one daughter point, the location of which is
obtained by adding a random vector to the coordinates of the mother point, with
all displacement vectors independently and identically distributed for all
points. The decoding problem is then the following one: the whole mother point
process is known as well as the coordinates of some daughter point; the
displacements are only known through their law; can one find the mother of this
daughter point? The Shannon regime is that where the dimension $n$ tends to
infinity and where the logarithm of the intensity of the point process is
proportional to $n$. We show that this problem exhibits a sharp threshold: if
the sum of the proportionality factor and of the differential entropy rate of
the noise is positive, then the probability of finding the right mother point
tends to 0 with $n$ for all point processes and decoding strategies. If this
sum is negative, there exist mother point processes, for instance Poisson, and
decoding strategies, for instance maximum likelihood, for which the probability
of finding the right mother tends to 1 with $n$. We then use large deviations
theory to show that in the latter case, if the entropy spectrum of the noise
satisfies a large deviation principle, then the error probability goes
exponentially fast to 0 with an exponent that is given in closed form in terms
of the rate function of the noise entropy spectrum. This is done for two
classes of mother point processes: Poisson and Mat\'ern. The practical interest
to information theory comes from the explicit connection that we also establish
between this problem and the estimation of error exponents in Shannon's
additive noise channel with power constraints on the codewords.

This problem arises in a variety of applications in signal processing ranging

of calibration/localization based on the time-of-flight (ToF) measurements
between sensors when the enclosed medium is homogeneous. In the presence of all
the pairwise ToFs, one can easily estimate the sensor positions using
multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) method. In practice however, due to the
transitional behaviour of the sensors and the beam form of the transducers, the
ToF measurements for close-by sensors are unavailable. Further, random
malfunctioning of the sensors leads to random missing ToF measurements. On top
of the missing entries, in practice an unknown time delay is also added to the
measurements. In this work, we incorporate the fact that a matrix defined from
all the ToF measurements is of rank at most four. In order to estimate the
missing ToFs, we apply a state-of-the-art low-rank matrix completion algorithm,
OPTSPACE . To find the correct positions of the sensors (our ultimate goal) we
then apply MDS. We show analytic bounds on the overall error of the whole
process in the presence of noise and hence deduce its robustness. Finally, we
confirm the functionality of our method in practice by simulations mimicking
the measurements of a circular ultrasound tomography device.

of the thermonuclear deflagration flame at the end of the convective carbon
""simmering"" phase in the core of the WD is still not well understood and much
about the ignition kernel distribution remains unknown. Furthermore, the
central density at the time of ignition depends on the still uncertain screened
carbon fusion reaction rates, the accretion history and cooling time of the
progenitor, and the composition. We present the results of twelve
high-resolution three-dimensional delayed detonation SN Ia explosion
simulations that employ a new criterion to trigger the deflagration to
detonation transition (DDT). All simulations trigger our DDT criterion and the
resulting delayed detonations unbind the star. We find a trend of increasing
iron group element (IGE) production with increasing central density for bright,
faint, and intermediate SNe. The total 56Ni yield, however, remains more or
less constant, even though increased electron captures at high density result
in a decreasing 56Ni mass fraction of the IGE material. We attribute this to an
approximate balance of 56Ni producing and destroying effects. The deflagrations
that were ignited at higher density initially have a faster growth rate of
subgrid-scale turbulence. Hence, the effective flame speed increases faster,
which triggers the DDT criterion earlier, at a time when the central density of
the expanded star is higher. This leads to an overall increase of IGE
production, which off-sets the percental reduction of 56Ni due to
neutronization.

analyzed blue, red-HB, and RR-Lyrae stars in the GC M4 and studied their Fe,
Na, and O abundances. Our goal is to investigate possible connections between
the bimodal HB of M4 and the chemical signatures of the two stellar populations
recently discovered among red giants of this cluster. We obtained
FLAMES-UVES/GIRAFFE spectra of a sample of 22 stars covering the HB from the
red to the blue region. While iron has the same abundance in both the red and
blue-HB segment, the red-HB is composed of stars with scaled-solar sodium
abundances, while the blue-HB stars are all sodium enhanced and oxygen
depleted. The RR-Lyrae are Na-poor, as the red-HB stars, and O-rich. This is
what we expect if the blue-HB consists of a second generation of stars formed
from the ejecta produced by an earlier stellar population through
high-temperature hydrogen-burning processes that include the CNO, NeNa, and
MgAl cycles and are therefore expected to be He-rich. According to this
scenario, the sodium and oxygen pattern detected in the blue and red-HB

doping with B or N is possible to open a small gap in the Dirac points, except
for the modulation of Fermi level. The surface charge which belongs to the
$\pi$ states near Dirac points is found to be redistributed locally. The charge
redistribution is contributed to the change of localized potential due to the
doping effects. This may be the reason that the energy states near Dirac points
is just disturbed in the energy region [-0.4eV, 0.4eV] for the doping of BN
domain. Thus, we suggest that the band opening induced by the doped BN domain
is due to the breaking of localized symmetry of the potential. Doping graphene

In particular, we consider two versions of this problem. In the explicit
version we wish to construct the smallest join-reachability graph for G. In the
implicit version we wish to build an efficient data structure (in terms of
space and query time) such that we can report fast the set of vertices that
reach a query vertex in all graphs of G. This problem is related to the
well-studied reachability problem and is motivated by emerging applications of
graph-structured databases and graph algorithms. We consider the construction
of join-reachability structures for two graphs and develop techniques that can
be applied to both the explicit and the implicit problem. First we present
optimal and near-optimal structures for paths and trees. Then, based on these
results, we provide efficient structures for planar graphs and general directed
graphs.

the behaviour across the deconfinement phase transition, are generally expected
to coincide with the critical indices of the two-dimensional XY model. It is
found that the determination of the infinite volume critical point differs from
the pseudo-critical coupling at L = 32, found earlier in the literature and
implicitly assumed as the onset value of the deconfined phase. The critical

and orbital orders in La0.5Sr1.5MnO4. Ultrafast melting of CE antiferromagnetic
spin order is evidenced by the disappearance of a (1/4,1/4,1/2) diffraction
peak. On the other hand the (1/4,1/4,0) peak, reflecting orbital order, is only
partially reduced. Cluster calculations aid our interpretation by considering
different magnetically ordered states accessible after photo-excitation.
Nonthermal coupling between light and magnetism emerges as a primary aspect of
photo-induced phase transitions in manganites.

Hilbert space into an external region where the system is described as $^3$He
and $^4$He clusters interacting only via the Coulomb interaction and an
internal region where the nuclear interaction will polarize the clusters.
Polarized configurations are obtained by a variation after parity and angular
momentum projection procedure with respect to the parameters of all single
particle states. A constraint on the radius of the intrinsic many-body state is
employed to obtain polarized clusters at desired distances. The boundary
conditions for bound and scattering states are implemented using the Bloch
operator.
  The FMD calculations reproduce the correct energy for the centroid of the
$3/2^-$ and $1/2^-$ bound states in $^7$Be. The charge radius of the ground
state is in good agreement with recent experimental results. The FMD
calculations also describe well the experimental phase shift data in the
$1/2^+$, $3/2^+$ and $5/2^+$ channels that are important for the capture
reaction at low energies. Using the bound and scattering many-body wave
functions we calculate the radiative capture cross section. The calculated $S$
factor agrees very well, both in absolute normalization and energy dependence,
with the recent experimental data from the Weizmann, LUNA, Seattle and ERNA

class in the three-dimensional Ising universality class. This crossover is
relevant for the behavior of films of binary mixtures near the demixing point
and a weak adsorption at one or both surfaces. We perform Monte Carlo
simulations of the improved Blume-Capel model on the simple cubic lattice. We
consider systems with film geometry, where various boundary conditions are
applied. We discuss corrections to scaling that are caused by the surfaces and
their relation with the so called extrapolation length. To this end we analyze
the behavior of the magnetization profile near the surfaces of films. We obtain
an accurate estimate of the renormalization group exponent y_{h_1}=0.7249(6)
for the ordinary surface universality class. Next we study the thermodynamic
Casimir force in the crossover region from the ordinary to the normal surface
universality class. To this end, we compute the Taylor-expansion of the
crossover finite size scaling function up to the second order in h_1 around
h_1=0, where h_1 is the external field at one of the surfaces. We check the
range of applicability of the Taylor-expansion by simulating at finite values
of h_1. Finally we study the approach to the strong adsorption limit h_1
\rightarrow \infty. Our results confirm the qualitative picture that emerges
from exact calculations for stripes of the two-dimensional Ising model, [D. B.

it also changes sign as a function of the thickness of the film.

learning can be used to give a new and intuitive computational semantics of
classical proofs in various fragments of Predicative Arithmetic.
  First, we extend Kreisel modified realizability to a classical fragment of
first order Arithmetic, Heyting Arithmetic plus EM1 (Excluded middle axiom
restricted to Sigma^0_1 formulas). We introduce a new realizability semantics
we call ""Interactive Learning-Based Realizability"". Our realizers are
self-correcting programs, which learn from their errors and evolve through
time.
  Secondly, we extend the class of learning based realizers to a classical
version PCFclass of PCF and, then, compare the resulting notion of
realizability with Coquand game semantics and prove a full soundness and
completeness result. In particular, we show there is a one-to-one
correspondence between realizers and recursive winning strategies in the
1-Backtracking version of Tarski games.
  Third, we provide a complete and fully detailed constructive analysis of
learning as it arises in learning based realizability for HA+EM1, Avigad's
update procedures and epsilon substitution method for Peano Arithmetic PA. We
present new constructive techniques to bound the length of learning processes
and we apply them to reprove - by means of our theory - the classic result of
Godel that provably total functions of PA can be represented in Godel's system
T.
  Last, we give an axiomatization of the kind of learning that is needed to
computationally interpret Predicative classical second order Arithmetic. Our
work is an extension of Avigad's and generalizes the concept of update
procedure to the transfinite case. Transfinite update procedures have to learn
values of transfinite sequences of non computable functions in order to extract
witnesses from classical proofs.

negative hadron beams on a liquid hydrogen target. A similar amount of data
with 190 GeV/c positive hadron beams has been taken in 2009, as well as some
data (negative beam) on nuclear targets. As a first result the observation of a
significant $J^{PC}$ spin-exotic signal in the 2004 data -- consistent with the
disputed $\pi_1(1600)$ -- was recently published. Our spectrometer features
good coverage by electromagnetic calorimetry, crucial for the detection of
final states involving $\pi^0$, $\eta$ or $\eta'$, and the 2008/09 data provide
an excellent opportunity for the simultaneous observation of new states in
different decay modes. The diffractively produced $(3\pi)^{-}$ system for
example can be studied in $\pi^{-}\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ and $\pi^{-}\pi^{0}\pi^{0}$
final states, respectively. Observation of new states in both modes provides
important consistency checks within the same experiment as the reconstruction

constrain the cluster total mass and/or gas mass using parameterised models and
assumptions of spherical symmetry and hydrostatic equilibrium. By numerically
exploring the probability distributions of the cluster parameters given the
simulated interferometric SZ data in the context of Bayesian methods, and
assuming a beta-model for the electron number density we investigate the
capability of this model and analysis to return the simulated cluster input
quantities via three rameterisations. In parameterisation I we assume that the
T is an input parameter. We find that parameterisation I can hardly constrain
the cluster parameters. We then investigate parameterisations II and III in
which fg(r200) replaces temperature as a main variable. In parameterisation II
we relate M_T(r200) and T assuming hydrostatic equilibrium. We find that
parameterisation II can constrain the cluster physical parameters but the
temperature estimate is biased low. In parameterisation III, the virial theorem
replaces the hydrostatic equilibrium assumption. We find that parameterisation
III results in unbiased estimates of the cluster properties. We generate a
second simulated cluster using a generalised NFW (GNFW) pressure profile and
analyse it with an entropy based model to take into account the temperature
gradient in our analysis and improve the cluster gas density distribution. This
model also constrains the cluster physical parameters and the results show a
radial decline in the gas temperature as expected. The mean cluster total mass
estimates are also within 1 sigma from the simulated cluster true values.
However, we find that for at least interferometric SZ analysis in practice at
the present time, there is no differences in the AMI visibilities between the
two models. This may of course change as the instruments improve.

vacuum nearby the media possessing a finite permittivity $\epsilon (\omega) =

considered. The method is developed in which polarization radiation is
represented as a field of the current density induced in matter by the field of
the moving charge. Solution is found for a problem of radiation arising when
the particle moves along the axis of the cylindrical channel inside a thin
screen of a finite radius and a finite permittivity. Depending on parameters of
the problem, the solution obtained describes different types of polarization
radiation: Cherenkov, transition, and diffraction radiations. In particular,
when the channel radius approaches zero and external radius of the screen tends
to infinity the expression found for radiated energy coincides with Pafomov
solution for transition radiation in a slab. In another special case of ideal
conductivity, the result obtained coincides with the one for diffraction
radiation generated by the particle in the round hole in the thin screen.
Solution is found for a problem of radiation generated when the charge moves
nearby a rectangular screen possessing a finite permittivity. The expression
derived describes diffraction and Cherenkov mechanisms of radiation and takes
into account the multiple reflections of radiation inside the screen. Solution
is also found for a problem of radiation generated when the particle moves
nearby a thin grating consisting of a finite number of rectangular strips
possessing a finite permittivity and separated with vacuum gaps (Smith-Purcell
radiation). In the special case of an ideally conducting grating, the formula

previous analysis for the MSSM taking into account improvements in the
theoretical calculations and the most recent exclusion bounds from the
Tevatron. We extend the MSSM analysis to new benchmark scenarios that are in
agreement with the cold dark matter relic abundance and other precision
measurements. We analyse the exclusive production of Higgs bosons in a model
with a fourth generation of fermions. Finally, we comment on the determination
of Higgs spin-parity and coupling structures at the LHC and show that the
forward proton mode could provide crucial information on the CP properties of
the Higgs bosons.

perturbative and non-perturbative QCD. It is therefore imperative to study p-p
collisions in as much detail as possible to provide a wide variety of data
against which the various theoretical calculations can be tested. Direct jet
measurements, for instance, help address fundamental questions of the
fragmentation process. These measurements form a critical baseline for
comparisons of results from heavy-ion studies, where modifications of the
fragmentation functions are expected due to interactions of the high ${Q^2}$
scattered partons with the hot and dense medium. Finally, it is also important
to gain a deeper understanding of how the beam-beam remnants, multi-parton
interactions and initial- and final-state radiation combine to produce the
particles observed in the underlying event. In this talk we present results on
jet production and the underlying event in p-p collisions at 200 GeV collisions
as measured by the STAR experiment at RHIC.

belief has been that the period between sonoluminescence flashes is steady on
the order of a few nanoseconds, and that sonoluminescence flashes occur with a

performance in motif finding methods. It is generally assumed that
false-positives are mostly due to algorithmic weakness of motif-finders. Here,
however, we derive the theoretical dependence of false positives on dataset
size and find that false positives can arise as a result of large dataset size,
irrespective of the algorithm used. Interestingly, the false-positive strength
depends more on the number of sequences in the dataset than it does on the
sequence length. As expected, false-positives can be reduced by decreasing the
sequence length or by adding more sequences to the dataset. The dependence on
number of sequences, however, diminishes and reaches a plateau after which
adding more sequences to the dataset does not reduce the false-positive rate
significantly. Based on the theoretical results presented here, we provide a
number of intuitive rules of thumb that may be used to enhance motif-finding
results in practice.

sourced by multi-tension cosmic superstring networks. First we obtain solutions
for the characteristic length scales and velocities associated with the
evolution of a network of F-D strings, allowing for the formation of junctions
between strings of different tensions. We find two distinct regimes describing
the resulting scaling distributions for the relative densities of the different
types of strings, depending on the magnitude of the fundamental string coupling
g_s. In one of them, corresponding to the value of the coupling being of order
unity, the network's stress-energy power spectrum is dominated by populous
light F and D strings, while the other regime, at smaller values of g_s, has
the spectrum dominated by rare heavy D strings. These regimes are seen in the
CMB anisotropies associated with the network. We focus on the dependence of the
shape of the B-mode polarisation spectrum on g_s and show that measuring the
peak position of the B-mode spectrum can point to a particular value of the
string coupling. Finally, we assess how this result, along with pulsar bounds
on the production of gravitational waves from strings, can be used to constrain
a combination of g_s and the fundamental string tension mu_F. Since CMB and
pulsar bounds constrain different combinations of the string tensions and
densities, they result in distinct shapes of bounding contours in the (mu_F,
g_s) parameter plane, thus providing complementary constraints on the
properties of cosmic superstrings.

presentation of localization and completion in algebraic topology. The
construction of localization and completion functors with respect to an
arbitrary generalized homology theory is derived from the axioms by using the
Brown representability theorem. These notes were never formally published, due
to an apparent flaw in the proof. The relevant representable functors could not
be shown to be set-valued, as opposed to class-valued. Subsequent work by A. K.
Bousfield established the existence of these functors, using more technical
simplicial methods. These functors are now an essential tool in homotopy
theory. The notes also contain an addendum devoted to establishing that a
certain element in the gamma family of the stable homotopy groups of spheres is
nonzero, using Brown-Peterson homology. At that time this was a matter of
controversy, as S. Oka and H. Toda claimed to have proved the contrary result.
  Besides being of historical interest, these notes give a very readable
introduction to localization and completion, with minimal prerequisites. A

surveys, one of these is the near-infrared YJKsVISTA survey of the Magellanic
Clouds system (VMC). This survey comprises the LMC, the SMC, the Bridge
connecting the two galaxies and two fields in the Stream. This paper provides
an overview of the VMC survey strategy and presents first science results. The
main goals of the VMC survey are the determination of the spatially resolved
SFH and 3D structure of the Magellanic system. Therefore, the VMC survey is
designed to reach stars as faint as the oldest main sequence turn-off point and
to constrain the mean magnitude of pulsating variable stars such as RR Lyrae
stars and Cepheids. This paper focuses on observations of VMC fields in the LMC
obtained between November 2009 and March 2010. These observations correspond to
a 7% completeness of the LMC fields. The VMC observations consist of
multi-epoch measurements organised following a specific structure. The data
were reduced using the VISTA Data Flow System pipeline whose source catalogues
were produced and made available via the VISTA Science Archive. The analysis of
the data shows that the sensitivity in each wave band agrees with expectations.
Uncertainties and completeness of the data are also derived. The first science
results, aimed at assessing the science quality of the VMC data, include an
overview of the distribution of stars in colour-magnitude and colour-colour
diagrams, the detection of planetary nebulae and of stellar clusters, and the
Ks band light-curve of variable stars. The VMC survey represents a tremendous
improvement, in spatial resolution and sensitivity, on previous panoramic
observations of the Magellanic system in the near-infrared and complements
nicely the deep observations at other wavelengths. (Abridged)
