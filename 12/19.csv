Flow through such discs
may provide most of the mass to gas giant planets, and such discs are likely
sites for the formation of regular satellites. We model these discs as
accretion discs subject to the tidal forces of the central star. The tidal
torques from the star remove the disc angular momentum near the disc outer edge
and permit the accreting disc gas to lose angular momentum at the rate
appropriate for steady accretion. Circumplanetary discs are truncated near the
radius where periodic ballistic orbits cross, where tidal forces on the disc
are strong. This radius occurs at approximately 0.4 r_H for the planet Hill
radius r_H. During the T Tauri stage of disc accretion, the disc is fairly
thick with aspect ratio H/r > 0.2 and the disc edge tapering occurs over a
radial scale ~ H ~ 0.1 r_H. For a circular or slightly eccentric orbit planet,
no significant resonances lie within the main body of the disc. Tidally driven
waves involving resonances nonetheless play an important role in truncating the
disc, especially when it is fairly thick. We model the disc structure using one
dimensional time-dependent and steady-state models and also two dimensional SPH
simulations. The circumplanetary disc structure depends on the variation of the
disc turbulent viscosity with radius and is insensitive to the angular
distribution of the accreting gas. Dead zones may occur within the
circumplanetary disc and result in density structures. If the disc is turbulent
throughout, the predicted disc structure near the location of the regular
Jovian and Saturnian satellites is smooth with no obvious feature that would
favor formation at their current locations.

dominate neutrinoless double beta decay, and its discovery at LHC would have
spectacular signatures of parity restoration and lepton number violation.
Moreover, LHC can measure the masses of the right-handed neutrinos and the
right-handed leptonic mixing matrix, which could in turn be used to predict the
rates for neutrinoless double decay and lepton flavor violating violating
processes. The LR scale at the LHC energies offers great hope of observing

Sensitive diagnostics of the temperatures, sizes, and densities of the trapped

development of techniques to precisely and reproducibly control the initial
experimental parameters. The use of a position-sensitive annihilation vertex
detector, together with the capability of controllably quenching the
superconducting magnetic minimum trap, enabled us to carry out a
high-sensitivity and low-background search for trapped synthesised antihydrogen

experimental run in 2009 involving mixing of 10^7 antiprotons with 1.3 10^9
positrons to produce 6 10^5 antihydrogen atoms, we have identified six
antiproton annihilation events that are consistent with the release of trapped
antihydrogen. The cosmic ray background, estimated to contribute 0.14 counts,
is incompatible with this observation at a significance of 5.6 sigma. Extensive
simulations predict that an alternative source of annihilations, the escape of
mirror-trapped antiprotons, is highly unlikely, though this possibility has not
yet been ruled out experimentally.

inconsistency with thermodynamics. It is sometimes concluded from this

after all; and even that quantum mechanics is indispensable for making sense of
this. In contrast, we argue that the classical statistics of distinguishable
particles and the resulting non-extensive entropy function are perfectly
acceptable from both a theoretical and an experimental perspective. The
inconsistency with thermodynamics can be removed by taking into account that
the entropy concept in statistical mechanics is not completely identical to the

The model is solved exactly and the energy spectrum is determined and analyzed
in particular for the lowest two levels. The entanglement is obtained over the
entire phase diagram, and its behavior can be used to delineate the boundaries
in the phase diagram. For example, the field-derivative of the entanglement
becomes singular along the critical line. The form of the divergence turns out
to be dictated by the universality class controlling the quantum phase
transition. The entanglement near criticality can be understood via a scaling
hypothesis, analogous to that for free energies. The entanglement density
vanishes along the so-called disorder line in the phase diagram, the ground
space is doubly degenerate and spanned by two product states. The entanglement
for the superposition of the lowest two states is also investigated. Even
though the exact value of the entanglement depends on the specific form of
superposition, in the thermodynamic limit the entanglement density is
independent of the superposition, showing that the entanglement density is
insensitive to whether the ground state is chosen to be the spontaneously $Z_2$
symmetry broken one or not. The finite-size scaling of entanglement at critical
points is also investigated from two different view points: (1) the maximum in
the field-derivative of the entanglement density vs. the system size, used to
deduce the correlation length exponent for the Ising class by the behavior of
entanglement; (2) the correction to the entanglement density vs. the system
size, with the coefficient being universal (but with different values for the

bubble crash (that took place in July 2008). This comparison indicates that the
period when the timing of the crash tended to change is close to the end, and
the burst of the gold bubble is the most probable in May or June 2011.
Secondly, we used the estimates of critical time for the hyperbolic trend (that
has been shown in our previous publications to be typical for many
socioeconomic processes). Our calculations with this method also indicate May -
June 2011 as the most probable time of the burst of the gold bubble. Naturally,
this forecast should not be regarded as an exact prediction as this implies the
stability of the finance policies of the USA, European Union, and China,
whereas a significant intervention of giant players (like the Federal Reserve
System, or the Central Bank of China) could affect the course of the exchange
game in a rather significant way. We also analyze possible consequences of the
burst of the ""gold bubble"".

ions and electrons. This introduces differences in plasma physics processes in
those media relative to the solar corona and the solar wind at a heliocentric
distance of 1 astronomical unit. In this paper, we consider two well-diagnosed,
partially-ionized interstellar plasmas. The first is the Diffuse Ionized Gas
(DIG) which is probably the extensive phase in terms of volume. The second is
the gas that makes up the Local Clouds of the Very Local Interstellar Medium
(VLISM). Ion-neutral interactions seem to be important in both media. In the
DIG, ion-neutral collisions are relatively rare, but sufficiently frequent to
damp magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves (as well as propagating MHD eddies) within
less than a parsec of the site of generation. This result raises interesting
questions about the sources of turbulence in the DIG. In the case of the VLISM,
the ion-neutral collision frequency is higher than that in the DIG, because the
hydrogen is partially neutral rather than fully ionized. We present results
showing that prominent features of coronal and solar wind turbulence seem to be
absent in VLISM turbulence. For example, ion temperature does not depend on ion
mass. This difference may be attributable to ion-neutral collisions, which
distribute power from more effectively heated massive ions such as iron to
other ion species and neutral atoms.

Linde-Buzo-Gray vector quantiser, called a stochastic vector quantiser (SVQ),
includes this required behaviour amongst its emergent properties, because it
automatically splits the input space into statistically independent subspaces,
which it then separately encodes. Various optimal SVQs have been obtained, both
analytically and numerically. Analytic solutions which demonstrate how the
input space is split into independent subspaces may be obtained when an SVQ is
used to encode data that lives on a 2-torus (e.g. the superposition of a pair
of uncorrelated sinusoids). Many numerical solutions have also been obtained,
using both SVQs and chains of linked SVQs: (1) images of multiple independent
targets (encoders for single targets emerge), (2) images of multiple correlated
targets (various types of encoder for single and multiple targets emerge), (3)
superpositions of various waveforms (encoders for the separate waveforms emerge

\xi=0$ and for states with well defined parity we recover Dirac results. In
general, we find the correct classical limit and a finite value $r_{c}^{2}$ for
the forward differential cross section, independent of the photon energy and of
the value of the parameters $g$ and $\xi$. The differential cross section
vanishes at high energies for all $g, \xi$ except in the forward direction. The
total cross section at high energies vanishes only for $g=2, \xi=0$. We argue
that this formalism is more convenient than Dirac theory in the description of

Crelay exploits both partial packets and overhearing capabilities of the

When a node overhears a partial packet from an upstream node, it informs the
upstream node about the number of parity bytes needed to correct the errors,
such that the upstream node need only send a small amount of parity bytes
instead of the complete packet, hence improving the network efficiency. Our
main contributions include the following. First, we propose an efficient
network protocol that can exploit partial packets and overhearing. Second, we
study the routing problem in networks with Crelay and propose a greedy
algorithm for finding the paths. Third, we propose an error ratio estimator,
called AMPS, that can estimate the number of byte errors in a received frame
with good accuracy at a low overhead of only 8 bytes per frame, where the
estimator is needed for a node to find the number of needed parity bytes.
Fourth, we implement the proposed protocol and algorithm within the Click

constrictions may have less impact on their performance. Prior to this work,
SNSPDs based on nanowires narrower than 50-nm had not been demonstrated
because: (1) the SNSPD signal is roughly proportional to the nanowire width, so
narrow nanowires have poor signal-to-noise ratio; and (2) fabrication at these

  admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1007.1573",,,,"hep-ph hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In our previous works the effective potential approach for composite
operators has been generalized to non-zero temperature in order to derive the
analytical equation of state for pure SU(3) Yang-Mills fields without quark
degrees of freedom. In the absence of external sources this is nothing but the
vacuum energy density. The key element of this derivation is the introduction
of a temperature dependence into the expression for the bag constant. The
non-perturbative part of the analytical equation of state does not depend on
the coupling constant, but instead introduces a dependence on the mass gap.
This is responsible for the large-scale dynamical structure of the QCD ground
state. The perturbative part of the analytical equation of state does depend on
the QCD fine-structure coupling constant $\alpha_s$. Here we develop the
analytical formalism, incorporating the perturbative part in a self-consistent
way. It makes it possible to calculate the PT contributions to the equation of
state in terms of the convergent series in integer powers of a small
$\alpha_s$. We also explicitly derive and numerically calculate the first
perturbative contribution of the $\alpha_s$-order to the non-perturbative part
of the equation of state derived and calculated previously. The analytical
equation of state or, equivalently, the gluon pressure is exponentially
suppressed at low temperatures, while at temperature $T=T_c = 266.5 \ \MeV$ it
has a maximum, if divided by $T^4/3$. It demonstrates a highly non-trivial
dependence on the mass gap and the temperature near to $T_c$ and up to
approximately $(3-4)T_c$. At very high temperatures its polynomial character is
confirmed, containing the terms proportional to $T^2$ and $T$ with a
non-analytical dependence on the mass gap.

It is expected that the model plays important roles in the quantum field. In
the quantum information theory, entanglement is a key resource. We use the von
Neumann entropy to measure the entanglement between the coin and the particle's
position of the quantum walks. Also we deal with the Shannon entropy which is
an important quantity in the information theory. In this paper, we show limits
of the von Neumann entropy and the Shannon entropy of the quantum walks on the
one dimensional lattice starting from the origin defined by arbitrary coin and
initial state. In order to derive these limits, we use the path counting method
which is a combinatorial method for computing probability amplitude.

interaction of particles with matter across a wide energy range. However, there
are also many well established reaction codes currently used in the same fields
where Geant4 is applied. One such code is the Ultra-relativistic Quantum
Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD) model. In order to take advantage of the UrQMD code,
we create a tool to enable comparisons among UrQMD and Geant4 hadronic models.
This tool allows a user to process the output file of UrQMD through Geant4
toolkit, while at the same time, can choose among different Geant4 hadronic
model generators. As an example, the UrQMD model is compared with the HARP-CDP
experimental data and with the Binary and FRITIOF generators, in the framework
of Geant4. It is shown that the UrQMD model can better reproduce charged pion
production for p+Cu and Pb interactions at 3, 8 and 15 GeV/c, and is a good
candidate for Geant4 hadronic models.

from the SWIRE XMMLSS and Lockman Hole fields. We have measured spectroscopic
redshifts for 293 new sources down to a 70{\mu}m flux limit of 9mJy and R < 22.
The redshift distribution peaks at z ~ 0.3 and has a high redshift tail out to
z = 3.5. We perform emission line diagnostics for 91 sources where [OIII],
H{\beta}, [NII], H{\alpha} and [SII] emission lines are available to determine
their power source. We find in our sample 13 QSOs, 1 Seyfert II galaxy, 33 star
forming galaxies, 30 composite galaxies, 5 LINERs and 21 ambiguous galaxies. We
fit single temperature dust spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to 81 70{\mu}m
sources with 160{\mu}m photometry to estimate dust temperatures and masses.
Assuming the dust emissivity factor ({\beta}) as 1.5, we determine temperatures
in the range ~ 20-60K and dust masses with a range of 10{^6}-10{^9} M{_\odot}.
Plotting these objects in the luminosity-temperature diagram suggests that
these objects have lower dust temperatures than local IR luminous galaxies. The
Herschel Space Observatory will be crucial in understanding the nature of these
sources and to accurately determining the shape of the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of
the dust SED. We then model SEDs from optical to far-IR for each source using a
set of galaxy and quasar templates in the optical and near-IR (NIR) and with a
set of dust emission templates (cirrus, M82 starburst, Arp 220 starburst and
AGN dust torus) in the mid-IR (MIR) to far-IR (FIR). The number of objects fit
with each dust template are: 57 Arp 220, 127 M82, 9 cirrus, 1 AGN dust torus,
70 M82 and cirrus, 26 M82 and AGN dust torus and 3 Arp 220 and AGN dust torus.
We determine the total IR luminosity (LIR) in range 10{^8}-10{^{15}} L{_\odot}
by integrating the SED models from 8 to 1000{\mu}m.

Homology and its applications in Pattern Recognition. In this paper we
introduce a pseudo-distance d_T that represents a possible solution to this
problem. Indeed, d_T is a pseudo-distance between multidimensional persistent
homology groups with coefficients in an Abelian group, hence possibly having
torsion. Our main theorem proves the stability of the new pseudo-distance with
respect to the change of the filtering function, expressed both with respect to
the max-norm and to the natural pseudo-distance between topological spaces
endowed with vector-valued filtering functions. Furthermore, we prove a result
showing the relationship between d_T and the matching distance in the
1-dimensional case, when the homology coefficients are taken in a field and
hence the comparison can be made.

through a quantum dot connected to current leads through spin-polarizing

even in the absence of external magnetic fields and greatly affects the
correlations in the dot. Using equation-of-motion and numerical renormalization
group calculations we obtain the conductance and spin polarization for this
system under different parameter regimes. We find that the system exhibits
spin-polarized conductance in both the Coulomb blockade and Kondo regimes, all
in the absence of applied magnetic fields. We analyze the role that the
spin-dependent tunneling amplitudes of the QPC play in determining the charge
and net magnetic moment in the dot. These effects, controllable by lateral gate
voltages, may provide an alternative approach for exploring Kondo correlations,
