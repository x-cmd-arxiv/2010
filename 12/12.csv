crucial to constrain galaxy evolutionary scenarios, only rest-frame optical
emission lines have been generally used to measure the metallicity. This has
prevented us to accurately measure the metallicity of dust-obscured galaxies,
and accordingly to understand the chemical evolution of dusty populations, such
as ultraluminous infrared galaxies. Here we propose diagnostics of the gas
metallicity based on infrared fine structure emission lines, which are nearly
unaffected by dust extinction even the most obscured systems. Specifically, we
focus on fine-structure lines arising mostly from HII regions, not in
photo-dissociation regions, to minimize the dependence and uncertainties of the
metallicity diagnostics from various physical parameters. Based on
photoionization models, we show that the emission-line flux ratio of
([OIII]51.80+[OIII]88.33)/[NIII]57.21 is an excellent tracer of the gas
metallicity. The individual line ratios [OIII]51.80/[NIII]57.21 or
[OIII]88.33/[NIII]57.21 can also be used as diagnostics of the metallicity, but
they suffer a stronger dependence on the gas density. The line ratios
[OIII]88.33/[OIII]51.80 and [NII]121.7/[NIII]57.21 can be used to measure and,
therefore, account for the dependences on the of the gas density and ionization
parameter, respectively. We show that these diagnostic fine-structure lines are
detectable with Herschel in luminous infrared galaxies out z=0.4. Metallicity
measurements with these fine-structure lines will be feasible at relatively
high redshift (z=1 or more) with SPICA, the future infrared space observatory.

shocks, driven inside a relativistic flow, are efficient enough to explain the
amount of energy observed as compared with the expected kinetic power of the
outflow. In this work we study the dynamic efficiency of conversion of
kinetic-to- thermal/magnetic energy of internal shocks in relativistic
magnetized outflows. We find that the collision between shells with a non-zero
relative velocity can yield either two oppositely moving shocks (in the frame
where the contact surface is at rest), or a reverse shock and a forward
rarefaction. For moderately magnetized shocks (magnetization {\sigma} ~ 0.1),
the dynamic efficiency in a single two-shell interaction can be as large as
40%. Hence, the dynamic efficiency of moderately magnetized shocks is larger
than in the corresponding unmagnetized two-shell interaction. We find that the
efficiency is only weakly dependent on the Lorentz factor of the shells and,
thus internal shocks in the magnetized flow of blazars and gamma-ray bursts are
approximately equally efficient.

topological type, after the choice of a particular basepoint (a complex or a

Teichm\""uller space, the length spectrum Teichm\""uller space, the
Fenchel-Nielsen Teichm\""uller space, and there are others. In general, these
spaces are set-theoretically different. An important question is therefore to
understand relations between these spaces. Each of these spaces is equipped
with its own metric, and under some hypotheses, there are inclusions between
these spaces. In this paper, we obtain local metric comparison results on these
inclusions, namely, we show that the inclusions are locally bi-Lipschitz under
certain hypotheses. To obtain these results, we use some hyperbolic geometry
estimates that give new results also for surfaces of finite type. We recall
that in the case of a surface of finite type, all these Teichm\""uller spaces
coincide setwise. In the case of a surface of finite type with no boundary
components (and possibly with punctures), we show that the restriction of the
identity map to any thick part of Teichm\""uller space is globally bi-Lipschitz
with respect to the length spectrum metric and the classical Teichm\""uller
metric on the domain and on the range respectively. In the case of a surface of
finite type with punctures and boundary components, there is a metric on the
Teichm\""uller space which we call the arc metric, whose definition is analogous
to the length spectrum metric, but which uses lengths of geodesic arcs instead
of lengths of closed geodesics. We show that the restriction of the identity
map restricted to any ""relative thick"" part of Teichm\""uller space is globally
bi-Lipschitz, with respect to any of the three metrics: the length spectrum
metric, the Teichm\""uller metric and the arc metric on the domain and on the
range.

projective tensor product of $B_{1}$ and $B_{2}$ (denoted by
$(B_{1}\hat{\otimes}_{\pi}B_{2})^{\ast}$), we define the so-called
$\chi$-covariation of $\X$ and $\Y$. If $\X=\Y$, the $\chi$-covariation is
called $\chi$-quadratic variation. The notion of $\chi$-quadratic variation is
a natural generalization of the one introduced by M\'etivier-Pellaumail and
Dinculeanu which is too restrictive for many applications. In particular, if
$\chi$ is the whole space $(B_{1}\hat{\otimes}_{\pi}B_{1})^{\ast}$ then the
$\chi$-quadratic variation coincides with the quadratic variation of a
$B_{1}$-valued semimartingale. We evaluate the $\chi$-covariation of various
processes for several examples of $\chi$ with a particular attention to the
case $B_{1}=B_{2}=C([-\tau,0])$ for some $\tau>0$ and $\X$ and $\Y$ being
\textit{window processes}. If $X$ is a real valued process, we call window
process associated with $X$ the $C([-\tau,0])$-valued process $\X:=X(\cdot)$

states in condensed matter systems. Predicted to be localized on cores of
vortices in certain non-conventional superconductors, their presence is known
to render the exchange statistics of bulk vortices non-Abelian. Here we study
the equations governing the dynamics of phase solitons (fluxons) in a long
Josephson junction in a topological superconductor. We show that the fluxon
will bind a localized zero energy Majorana mode and will consequently behave as
a non-Abelian anyon. The low mass of the fluxon, as well as its experimentally
observed quantum mechanical wave-like nature, will make it a suitable candidate
for vortex interferometry experiments demonstrating non-Abelian statistics. We
suggest two experiments that may reveal the presence of the zero mode carried
by the fluxon. Specific experimental realizations will be discussed as well.

plasma, represented through a probability density function (PDF) that
self-interacts via an electrostatic force. One of the main difficulties in
numerically solving this system is the severe time-step restriction that arises
from parts of the PDF associated with moderate-to-large velocities. The
dominant approach in the plasma physics community for removing these time-step
restrictions is the so-called particle-in-cell (PIC) method, which discretizes
the distribution function into a set of macro-particles, while the electric
field is represented on a mesh. Several alternatives to this approach exist,
including fully Lagrangian, fully Eulerian, and so-called semi-Lagrangian
methods. The focus of this work is the semi-Lagrangian approach, which begins
with a grid-based Eulerian representation of both the PDF and the electric
field, then evolves the PDF via Lagrangian dynamics, and finally projects this
evolved field back onto the original Eulerian mesh. In particular, we develop
in this work a method that discretizes the 1+1 Vlasov-Poisson system via a
high-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method in phase space, and an operator
split, semi-Lagrangian method in time. Second-order accuracy in time is
relatively easy to achieve via Strang operator splitting. With additional work,
using higher-order splitting and a higher-order method of characteristics, we
also demonstrate how to push this scheme to fourth-order accuracy in time. We
show how to resolve all of the Lagrangian dynamics in such a way that mass is
exactly conserved, positivity is maintained, and high-order accuracy is
achieved. The Poisson equation is solved to high-order via the smallest stencil
local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) approach. We test the proposed scheme on
several standard test cases.

investigate effects of two kinds of interfering fluctuations on the phase

Fluctuations in the electron subsystem- finite-size quantum fluctuations- are
responsible for the dephasing of the coherence in the radiation domain and for
the moderate occupation of the excited states in the normal domain. In the
quasiclassical limit, radiation phase implies existence of a coherent acoustic
super-radiant phase. (ii) Level-spacing fluctuations in excited boson level
subsystem with strong level repulsions. Related probability distributions are
shown to be non-universally spread between the limiting universal Wigner-Dyson
and Poisson distributions. We proved that the difference in boson frequencies
is responsible for reaching the most stochastic limit of the Wigner-Dyson
distribution. Instanton lattice as a sequence of tunneling events in the most
chaotic radiation domain exhibits maximal number of level-avoidings
(repulsions). The non-universality of the distributions is caused by boson
correlations which compete the level repulsions.

check the IR absorption of gas. In this paper we give the simple theoretical
basis for this PAS. The amplitude of sound observed in PAS depends on the
modulation frequency of IR pulse. Its dependence can be explained by this
simple model. Further we show the sound amplitude does not depend on the
thermal diffusion, which provides the accuracy of amplitude as the IR
absorption rate of the gas. According to this model, sound signal is not the
sinusoidal function and it has higher harmonics. The theory and experiment are
compared in the third harmonics by spectrum analysis. From this apparatus and
theory, students can study not only the greenhouse effect but also the basics
of physics.

created, namely real-time multimedia applications. Delivering real-time
multimedia traffic over a complex network like the Internet is a particularly
challenging task since these applications have strict quality -of-service (QoS)
requirements on bandwidth, delay, and delay jitter. Traditional IP-based best
effort service will not be able to meet these stringent requirements. The
time-varying nature of wireless channels and resource constrained wireless
devices make the problem even more difficult. To improve perceived media
quality by end users over wireless Internet, QoS supports can be addressed in
different layers, including application layer, transport layer and link layer.
Cross layer design is a well-known approach to achieve this adaptation. In
cross-layer design, the challenges from the physical wireless medium and the
QoS-demands from the applications are taken into account so that the rate,
power, and coding at the physical layer can adapted to meet the requirements of
the applications given the current channel and network conditions. A number of
propositions for cross-layer designs exist in the literature. In this paper, an
extensive review has been made on these cross-layer architectures that combine
the application-layer, transport layer and the link layer controls.
Particularly the issues like channel estimation techniques, adaptive controls
at the application and link layers for energy efficiency, priority based

An alternative proposition is to perform in-network computation. This, however,

  September 2010",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is argued that realism and true randomness are fully compatible. Realistic
true random events are acts of pure creation that obey strict laws, but do not
necessarily satisfy Kolmogorov's axioms of probabilities. Realistic true
randomness is some sort of nondeterministic force, or propensity of physical
systems to manifest such and such properties under such and such conditions.
Realistic random events reflect preexisting properties, as required by realism,
simply the reflection is not deterministic; still, the preexisting properties
determine the propensities of the different possible events.
  It is argued that deterministic extensions of quantum physics are necessarily
incompatible with special relativity. Hence, from today's violations of Bell's
inequalities one can conclude that all future physics theories will display
true randomness as does quantum physics.
  It is argued that accepting true randomness and realism leads to new
questions with interesting answers, allowing one 1) to study nonlocality in
configurations with many independent sources and 2) to bound how much free will
is needed for a proper violation of Bell's inequality.

density-density correlations. The spin-spin AF (antiferromagnetic) interactions
and nearest-neighbor repulsion, resulting from the e-e and the e-ph
interactions respectively, are the dominant terms (compared to hopping) and
compete to determine the various correlated phases. As e-e interaction $(U/t)$
is increased, the system transits from an AF cluster to a correlated singlet
phase through a discontinuous transition at all strong e-ph couplings $2 \leq g
\leq 3$ considered. At higher values of $U/t$ and moderately strong e-ph
interactions ($2 \leq g \leq 2.6$), the singlets break up to form an AF order
and then to a paramagnetic order all in a single sublattice; whereas at larger
values of $g$ ($> 2.6$), the system jumps directly to the spin disordered
charge-density-wave (CDW) phase.

detected in presolar grains and in evolved red giants. The abundances of some
of these nuclei cannot be accounted for by canonical stellar models and require
non-convective mixing below the envelope, occurring during the phases of the
Red Giant Branch (RGB) and of the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB). Similar
mechanisms appear to be necessary to account for the formation of the neutron
source driving s processing. We present a short review of these phenomena and
we comment on the picture that emerges from the set of available data on the
evolution and nucleosynthesis in low mass stars. Our conclusions include: i)
the need for deep mixing in both RGB and AGB stars; ii) the suggestion that
these phenomena occur at a non-negligible velocity, possibly incompatible with
diffusive processes; iii) the verification that the abundances of neutron-rich
nuclei are presently increasing in the Galaxy, contrary to previous
expectations and hence that the s process has new surprises to offer us; iv)
the recognition of the growing importance of very low mass stars for Galactic
nucleosynthesis.

work has shown that a quadrature-entangled light source can reap a substantial

breaking, standoff target-detection being an example. In this paper, we make a
first step in extending this quantum illumination paradigm to the optical
imaging domain, viz., to obtain better spatial resolution for standoff optical
sensing. Our canonical imaging scenario---restricted, for simplicity, to one
transverse dimension---is taken to be that of resolving one versus two
closely-spaced in-phase specular point targets. We show that an entangled-state
transmitter, which uses continuous-wave-pumped spontaneous parametric
downconversion (SPDC), achieves an error-probability exponent that exceeds that
of all classical-state transmitters of the same average power. Using these
error-exponent results, we find the ultimate spatial-resolution limits for
coherent-state and SPDC imaging systems that use their respective
quantum-optimal receivers, thus quantifying the latter's spatial-resolution
advantage over the former. We also propose a structured optical receiver that
is ideally capable of harnessing 3 dB (of the full 6 dB) gain in the
error-probability exponent achievable by the SPDC transmitter and its
quantum-optimal receiver.

plasmas in which oppositely directed magnetic fields changes its connectivity
and eventually converts its energy into kinetic and thermal energy of the
plasma. Recently, ubiquitous jets (for example, chromospheric anemone jets,
penumbral microjets, umbral light bridge jets) have been observed by Solar
Optical Telescope on board the satellite Hinode. These tiny and frequently
occurring jets are considered to be a possible evidence of small-scale
ubiquitous reconnection in the solar atmosphere. However, the details of three
dimensional magnetic configuration are still not very clear. Here we propose a
new model based on three dimensional simulations of magnetic reconnection using
a typical current sheet magnetic configuration with a strong guide field. The
most interesting feature is that the jets produced by the reconnection
eventually move along the guide field lines. This model provides a fresh
understanding of newly discovered ubiquitous jets and moreover a new
observational basis for the theory of astrophysical magnetic reconnection.
