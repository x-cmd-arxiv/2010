particular water ice - that occur within these spots using HIRISE and CRISM
observations, as well as the LMD Global Climate Model. Our studies focus on
Richardson crater (72{\deg}S, 179{\deg}E) and cover southern spring and summer
(LS 175{\deg} - 17 341{\deg}). Three units have been identified of these spots:
dark core, gray ring and bright halo. Each unit show characteristic changes as
the season progress. In winter, the whole area is covered by CO2 ice with H2O
ice contamination. Dark spots form during late winter and early spring. During
spring, the dark spots are located in a 10 cm thick depression compared to the
surrounding bright ice-rich layer. They are spectrally characterized by weak
CO2 ice signatures that probably result from spatial mixing of CO2 ice rich and
ice free regions within pixels, and from mixing of surface signatures due to
aerosols scattering. The bright halo shaped by winds shows stronger CO2
absorptions than the average ice covered terrain, which is consistent with a
formation process involving CO2 re-condensation. According to spectral,
morphological and modeling considerations, the gray ring is composed of a thin
layer of a few tens of {\mu}m of water ice. Two sources/processes could
participate to the enrichment of water ice in the gray ring unit: (i) water ice
condensation at the surface in early fall (prior to the condensation of a CO2
rich winter layer) or during winter time (due to cold trapping of the CO2
layer); (ii) ejection of dust grains surrounded by water ice by the geyser
activity responsible for the dark spot. In any case, water ice remains longer
in the gray ring unit after the complete sublimation of the CO2. Finally, we
also looked for liquid water in the near-IR CRISM spectra using linear unmixing
modeling but found no conclusive evidence for it.

also influenced by defects and dopants resulting from different processing

the transport properties. In more detail, the investigated combination of
isopropanol and heating treatment reduces the doping concentration and
significantly increases the mobility of graphene. Furthermore, the isopropanol
treatment alone increases the concentration of dopants and introduces an

carried out using the AMI Large Array (LA) at an observing frequency of 15.7
GHz, are presented. The survey fields cover an area of approximately 27 sq.
degrees to a flux-density completeness of 1 mJy. Results for some deeper areas,
covering approximately 12 sq. degrees, wholly contained within the total areas
and complete to 0.5 mJy, are also presented. The completeness for both areas is
estimated to be at least 93 per cent.
  The source catalogue contains 1897 entries and is available at
www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/surveys/10C. It has been combined with that of the 9C Survey
to calculate the 15.7-GHz source counts. A broken power law is found to provide
a good parameterisation of the differential count between 0.5 mJy and 1 Jy. The
measured count has been compared to that predicted by de Zotti et al. (2005).
The model displays good agreement with the data at the highest flux densities
but under-predicts the integrated count between 0.5 mJy and 1 Jy by about 30
per cent.
  Entries from the source catalogue have been matched to those contained in the
catalogues of NVSS and FIRST (both of which have observing frequencies of 1.4
GHz). This matching provides evidence for a shift in the typical
1.4-to-15.7-GHz spectral index of the 15.7-GHz-selected source population with
decreasing flux density towards sub-mJy levels - the spectra tend to become
less steep.
  Automated methods for detecting extended sources have been applied to the
data; approximately 5 per cent of the sources are found to be extended relative
to the LA synthesised beam of approximately 30 arcsec. Investigations using
higher-resolution data showed that most of the genuinely extended sources at 16
GHz are classical doubles, although some nearby galaxies and twin-jet sources
were also identified.

detection inefficiency are included can be overcome by using a hybrid
entanglement witness that allows efficient correction for losses in the

enduring enterprise, especially hindered by limited knowledge of the mechanisms
through which extinction of infection propagation comes about. We here report
on a mechanism causing extinction of a propagating infection due to
intraspecific competition to infect susceptible hosts. Beneficial mutations
allow the pathogen to increase the production of progeny, while the host cell
is allowed to develop defenses against infection. When the number of
susceptible cells is unlimited, a feedback runaway co-evolution between host
resistance and progeny production occurs. However, physical space limits the
advantage that the virus can obtain from increasing offspring numbers, thus
infection clearance may result from an increase in host defenses beyond a
finite threshold. Our results might be relevant to better understand
propagation of viral infections in tissues with mobility constraints, and the
implications that environments with different geometrical properties might have
in devising control strategies.

of the estimation of moments for multifractal processes, is revisited borrowing
concepts from the statistical physics of disordered systems, notably from the
analysis of the so-called Random Energy Model. Considering a standard
multifractal process (compound Poisson motion), chosen as a simple
representative example, we show: i) the existence of a critical order $q^*$
beyond which moments, though finite, cannot be estimated through empirical
averages, irrespective of the sample size of the observation; ii) that
multifractal exponents necessarily behave linearly in $q$, for $q > q^*$.
Tayloring the analysis conducted for the Random Energy Model to that of
Compound Poisson motion, we provide explicative and quantitative predictions
for the values of $q^*$ and for the slope controlling the linear behavior of
the multifractal exponents. These quantities are shown to be related only to
the definition of the multifractal process and not to depend on the sample size
of the observation. Monte-Carlo simulations, conducted over a large number of
large sample size realizations of compound Poisson motion, comfort and extend
these analyses.

missing-spin defect at the transition takes on a finite-size scaling form
consistent with expectations from standard scaling arguments at a
scale-invariant quantum critical point, albeit with significant subleading
power-law finite size corrections that we analyze in detail. Together with
recently-found logarithmic violations of scaling at similar continuous
transitions in the SU(2) case, our results provide indirect evidence for the
existence of operators that become marginal as $N$ is reduced to 2 in the field
theoretical description of these deconfined critical points.

calculable in the formalism based on a construction in which the electroweak

$SU(2/1)$. Here we follow original works of Ne'eman and Fairlie believing that
bosonic fields take their values in the Lie superalgebra and fermionic fields
take their values in its representation space. At the same time, our approach
differs significantly. The main one is that while for them the gauge symmetry
group is $SU(2/1)$, here we consider only symmetries generated by its even
subgroup, i.e., symmetries of the standard electroweak model. The reason is
that such formalism fixes the quartic Higgs coupling and at the same time
removes the sign and statistics problems. The main result is that the presented
model predicts values of the Weinberg angle and the Higgs mass correctly up to
the two-loop level. Moreover, the model sets the unification scale coinciding
with the electroweak scale and automatically describes the fermions correctly
with the correct quark and lepton charges.

extended Hubbard-Peierls model describing one dimensional $\pi$-conjugated
polymers. The model incorporates electron-phonon and hyperfine interaction and
it is solved at the mean field level for half filling. In particular we explore
the model as a function of the strength of electron-electron and
electron-phonon interactions. At low temperature the system presents a
diamagnetic to antiferromagnetic transition as the electron-electron
interaction strength increases. At the same time by increasing the
electron-phonon coupling there is a transition from a homogeneous to a Peierls
dimerized geometry. As expected such a Peierls dimerized phase disappears at
finite temperature as a result of thermal vibrations. More intriguing is the
interplay between the electron-phonon and the electron-electron interactions at
finite temperature. In particular we demonstrate that for a certain region of
the parameter space there is a spin-crossover, where the system transits from a
low-spin to a high-spin state as the temperature increases. In close analogy to
standard spin-crossover in divalent magnetic molecules such a transition is
entropy driven. Finally we discuss the role played by the hyperfine interaction
over the phase diagram.

together with static timing variables as well as a dynamic variable abstracting
the timeout behavior. We extend LTL with the capability to express timeout
constraints. From the expressiveness view point, TLTL is not comparable with
important known clock based real-time logics including TPTL, XCTL, and MTL,
i.e., TLTL can specify certain properties, which cannot be specified in these
logics (also vice-versa). We define a corresponding timeout tableau for
satisfiability checking of the TLTL formulas. Also a model checking algorithm
over timeout Kripke structure is presented. Further we prove that the validity
checking for such an extended logic remains PSPACE-complete even in the
presence of timeout constraints and infinite state models. Under discrete time
semantics, with bounded timeout increments, the model-checking problem that if
a TLTL-formula holds in a timeout Kripke structure is also PSPACE complete. We
further prove that when TLTL is interpreted over discrete time, it can be
embedded in the monadic second order logic with time, and when TLTL is
interpreted over dense time without the condition of non-zenoness, the
resulting logic becomes $\Sigma_1^1$-complete.

secular (i.e., orbit-averaged) interactions, because these often dominate on
long timescales. We first focus on the evolution of a test particle that is
forced by multiple massive planets. To linear order in eccentricity and
inclination, its orbit precesses with constant frequencies. But nonlinearities
can shift the frequencies into and out of secular resonance with the planets'
eigenfrequencies, or with linear combinations of those frequencies. The overlap
of these nonlinear secular resonances drive secular chaos in planetary systems.
We quantify the resulting dynamics for the first time by calculating the
locations and widths of nonlinear secular resonances. When results from both
analytical calculations and numerical integrations are displayed together in a
newly developed ""map of the mean momenta"" (MMM), the agreement is excellent.
This map is particularly revealing for non-coplanar planetary systems and
demonstrates graphically that chaos emerges from overlapping secular
resonances. We then apply this newfound understanding to Mercury. Previous
numerical simulations have established that Mercury's orbit is chaotic, and
that Mercury might even collide with Venus or the Sun. We show that Mercury's
chaos is primarily caused by the overlap between resonances that are
combinations of four modes, the Jupiter-dominated eccentricity mode, the
Venus-dominated inclination mode and Mercury's free eccentricity and
inclination. Numerical integration of the Solar system confirms that a slew of
these resonant angles alternately librate and circulate. We are able to
calculate the threshold for Mercury to become chaotic: Jupiter and Venus must
have eccentricity and inclination of a few percent. Mercury appears to be
perched on the threshold for chaos.

images via forward modeling of the instrument response and involving an
algebraic nonlinear minimization. The method is applied to simulated maps of
the Murchison Wide-field Array but is generally useful in cases where only
image data are available. After source subtraction, the residual maps have no
statistical difference to the expected thermal noise distribution at all
angular scales, indicating high effectiveness in the subtraction. Simulations
indicate that the errors in recovering the source parameters decrease with
increasing signal-to-noise ratio, which is consistent with the theoretical
measurement errors. In applying the technique to simulated snapshot
observations with the Murchison Wide-field Array, we found that all 101 sources
present in the simulation were recovered with an average position error of 10
arcsec and an average flux density error of 0.15%. This led to a dynamic range
increase of approximately 3 orders of magnitude. Since all the sources were
deconvolved jointly, the subtraction was not limited by source sidelobes but by
thermal noise. This technique is a promising deconvolution method for upcoming
radio arrays with a huge number of elements, and a candidate for the difficult
task of subtracting foreground sources from observations of the 21 cm neutral
Hydrogen signal from the epoch of reionization.

The method inherits the attractive stabilizing mechanism of upwinded
discontinuous Galerkin methods when momentum advection becomes significant,
equal-order interpolations can be used for the velocity and pressure fields,
and mass can be conserved locally. Using continuous Lagrange multiplier spaces
to enforce flux continuity across cell facets, the number of global degrees of
freedom is the same as for a continuous Galerkin method on the same mesh.
Different from our earlier investigations on the approach for the
Navier--Stokes equations, the pressure field in this work is discontinuous
across cell boundaries. It is shown that this leads to very good local mass
conservation and, for an appropriate choice of finite element spaces, momentum
conservation. Also, a new form of the momentum transport terms for the method
is constructed such that global energy stability is guaranteed, even in the
absence of a point-wise solenoidal velocity field. Mass conservation, momentum
conservation and global energy stability are proved for the time-continuous
case, and for a fully discrete scheme. The presented analysis results are
supported by a range of numerical simulations.

valid for closed 2-forms that may be degenerate. As a corollary, we are able to

of the ""six operations"" in these categories, we identify F_X^m with the exact
subcategory in DM(X,Z/m) consisting of all the iterated extensions of the Tate
twists M_cc^m(Y/X)(j) of the motives M_cc^m(Y/X). An isomorphism of the
Z/m-modules Ext between the Tate motives Z/m(j) in the exact category F_X^m
with the motivic cohomology modules predicted by the Beilinson-Lichtenbaum
etale descent conjecture (recently proven by Voevodsky, Rost, et al.) holds for
smooth varieties X over K if and only if the similar isomorphism holds for
Artin-Tate motives over fields containing K. When K contains a primitive m-root
of unity, the latter condition is equivalent to a certain Koszulity hypothesis,
as it was shown in our previous paper arXiv:1006.4343

exponents. We first show that, for the O(N) model, the resummation does not
eliminate all non-physical (spurious) fixed points (FPs). Then the dependence
of spurious as well as of the Wilson-Fisher FPs on the resummation parameters
is carefully studied. The critical exponents at the Wilson-Fisher FP show a
weak dependence on the resummation parameters. On the contrary, the exponents
at the spurious FP as well as its very existence are strongly dependent on
these parameters. For the cubic model, a new stable FP is found and its
properties depend also strongly on the resummation parameters. It appears to be
spurious, as expected. As for the frustrated models, there are two cases
depending on the value of the number of spin components. When N is greater than
a critical value Nc, the stable FP shows common characteristic with the
Wilson-Fisher FP. On the contrary, for N<Nc, the results obtained at the stable
FP are similar to those obtained at the spurious FPs of the O(N) and cubic
models. We conclude from this analysis that the stable FP found for N<Nc in
frustrated models is spurious. Since Nc>3, we conclude that the transitions for
XY and Heisenberg frustrated magnets are of first order.

alternate with integer mode-locked regions with bistable excitation edge. There

discovered earlier in the high-frequency regime. For $I_0<I_{th}$ and small
noise the firing rate has a maximum at the resonant frequency. For larger noise
and subthreshold stimulation the maximum firing rate initially shifts towards
lower frequencies, then returns to higher frequencies in the limit of large
noise. The stochastic coherence antiresonance, defined as the maximum of the
coefficient of variation as a function of noise intensity, occurs over a wide
range of parameter values, including monostable regions.

p), to a marginal Fermi liquid behavior at a critical value of p, to a generic
non-Fermi liquid at intermediate values of p, and finally to a Mott insulator
at large values of the bulk Pauli coupling. As all of these phases are seen in
the cuprate phase diagram, the holographic model we study has the key elements
of the strong coupling physics typified by Mott systems. In addition, we extend
our analysis to finite temperature and show that the Mott gap closes. Of
particular interest is that it closes when the ratio of the gap to the critical
temperature is of the order of ten. This behavior is very much similar to that
observed in the classic Mott insulator VO_2. We then analyze the
non-analyticities of the boundary theory fermion correlators for generic values
of frequency and momentum by calculating the quasi-normal modes of the bulk
fermions. Not surprisingly, we find no evidence for the dipole interaction
inducing an instability in the boundary theory. Finally, we briefly consider

outside the Galaxy. Within the broad observed band, we estimate that 28% of the
total measured flux is due to the molecular line contribution, with CO only
contributing 9% to the overall flux. We present maps of the CO emission at a
resolution of 2.9""x1.9"" which, though not enough to resolve the two nuclei,
recover all the single-dish flux. The 40 GHz spectral scan has been modelled
assuming LTE conditions and abundances are derived for all identified species.
The chemical composition of Arp 220 shows no clear evidence of an AGN impact on
the molecular emission but seems indicative of a purely starburst-heated ISM.
The overabundance of H2S and the low isotopic ratios observed suggest a
chemically enriched environment by consecutive bursts of star formation, with
an ongoing burst at an early evolutionary stage. The large abundance of water
(~10^-5), derived from the isotopologue H2(18)O, as well as the vibrationally
excited emission from HC3N and CH3CN are claimed to be evidence of massive star
forming regions within Arp 220. Moreover, the observations put strong
constraints on the compactness of the starburst event in Arp 220. We estimate
that such emission would require ~2-8x10^6 hot cores, similar to those found in
the Sgr B2 region in the Galactic center, concentrated within the central 700
pc of Arp 220.

comparison, convergence diagnostic, and error estimation in astronomy. In this
manuscript, we discuss the pitfalls involved in using reduced chi-squared.
There are two independent problems: (a) The number of degrees of freedom can
only be estimated for linear models. Concerning nonlinear models, the number of
degrees of freedom is unknown, i.e., it is not possible to compute the value of
reduced chi-squared. (b) Due to random noise in the data, also the value of
reduced chi-squared itself is subject to noise, i.e., the value is uncertain.
This uncertainty impairs the usefulness of reduced chi-squared for
differentiating between models or assessing convergence of a minimisation
procedure. The impact of noise on the value of reduced chi-squared is
surprisingly large, in particular for small data sets, which are very common in
astrophysical problems. We conclude that reduced chi-squared can only be used
with due caution for linear models, whereas it must not be used for nonlinear
models at all. Finally, we recommend more sophisticated and reliable methods,
which are also applicable to nonlinear models.

the galaxy is dominated by an old, metal-poor population, with a significant
metallicity spread. A very clean detection of the RGB tip allows us to derive
an accurate distance of D=1.3 +/- 0.1 Mpc. Combining surface photometry with
star counts, we are able to trace the surface brightness profile of VV124 out
to ~ 5' = 1.9 kpc radius (where mu_r=30 mag/arcsec^2), showing that it is much
more extended than previously believed. Moreover, the surface density map
reveals the presence of two symmetric flattened wings emanating from the
central elongated spheroid and aligned with its major axis, resembling a
stellar disk seen nearly edge-on. We also present HI observations obtained with
the WSRT, the first ever of this object. A total amount of 10^6 M_sun of HI gas
is detected in VV124. Compared to the total luminosity, this gives a value of
M_HI/L_V=0.11, which is particularly low for isolated Local Group dwarfs. The
spatial distribution of the gas does not correlate with the observed stellar
wings. The systemic velocity of the HI in the region superposed to the stellar
main body of the galaxy is V_h=-25 km/s. The velocity field shows substructures
typical of galaxies of this size but no sign of rotation. The HI spectra

temperature after inflation T_R to exceed ~2\times 10^9 GeV. Such a high T_R
value typically leads to an overproduction of gravitinos in the early universe,
which will cause conflicts, mainly with BBN constraints. Asaka and Yanagida
(AY) have proposed that these two issues can be reconciled in the context of
the Peccei-Quinn augmented MSSM (PQMSSM) if one adopts a mass hierarchy
m(sparticle)>m(gravitino)>m(axino), with m(axino) keV. We calculate the relic
abundance of mixed axion/axino dark matter in the AY scenario, and investigate
under what conditions a value of T_R sufficient for thermal leptogenesis can be
generated. A high value of PQ breaking scale f_a is needed to suppress
overproduction of axinos, while a small vacuum misalignment angle \theta_i is
needed to suppress overproduction of axions. The large value of f_a results in
late decaying neutralinos. To avoid BBN constraints, the AY scenario requires a
low thermal abundance of neutralinos and high values of neutralino mass. We
include entropy production from late decaying saxions, and find the saxion
needs to be typically at least several times heavier than the gravitino. A
viable AY scenario suggests that LHC should discover a spectrum of SUSY
particles consistent with weak scale supergravity; that the apparent neutralino
abundance is low; that a possible axion detection signal (probably with m_axion
in the sub-micro-eV range) should occur, but no direct or indirect signals for
WIMP dark matter should be observed.

these issues. We obtain analytic approximations and numerical solutions for
antiproton flux assuming that the diffusion coefficient increases exponentially
with the distance from the disk, and including contributions from dark matter
annihilations/decays in essentially the full dark matter halo. We find that the
antiproton flux predicted in this model deviates from the conventional
calculation for the same dark matter parameters by up to about 25%.

drag consisting of particles interacting via a Yukawa potential that are placed
in two coupled one-dimensional channels. The particles in one channel are
driven and experience a drag from the undriven particles in the second channel.
In the absence of pinning, for a finite driving force there is no pinned phase;
instead, there are two dynamical regimes of completely coupled or locked flow
and partially coupled flow. When pinning is added to one or both channels, we
find that a remarkably rich variety of dynamical phases and drag effects arise
that can be clearly identified by features in the velocity force curves. The
presence of quenched disorder in only the undriven channel can induce a pinned
phase in both channels. Above the depinning transition, the drag on the driven
particles decreases with increasing pinning strength, and for high enough
pinning strength, the particles in the undriven channel reach a reentrant
pinned phase which produces a complete decoupling of the channels. We map out
the dynamic phase diagrams as a function of pinning strength and the density of
pinning in each channel. Our results may be relevant for understanding drag
coupling in 1D Wigner crystal phases, and the effects we observe could also be
explored using colloids in coupled channels produced with optical arrays,
vortices in nanostructured superconductors, or other layered systems where drag
effects arise.

varying structure (VCVS) graphical model underlying nonstationary time series
data, such as social states of interacting individuals or microarray expression
profiles of gene networks, as opposed to i.i.d. data from an invariant model
widely considered in current literature of structural estimation. In
particular, we consider the scenario in which the model evolves in a piece-wise
constant fashion. We propose a procedure that minimizes the so-called TESLA
loss (i.e., temporally smoothed L1 regularized regression), which allows
jointly estimating the partition boundaries of the VCVS model and the
coefficient of the sparse precision matrix on each block of the partition. A
highly scalable proximal gradient method is proposed to solve the resultant
convex optimization problem; and the conditions for sparsistent estimation and
the convergence rate of both the partition boundaries and the network structure
are established for the first time for such estimators.

toward the ordinary Lorentz-invariant (2+1) dimensional Ising critical point,
illustrating that CQCPs are generically unstable. We exploit a correspondence

the stability of the cluster. For (OH)7 clusters that were situated greater
than 3 nm from one another, the reconstruction barrier to a nonmagnetic

ranging from 0.3 to 29 MJup, in mass and between 0.7 and 10 years in orbital
period. The low metallicity of most of these new planet-hosting stars
reinforces the current trend for long-distance planets around metal-poor stars.

planetary systems, although confidence in the solution may be low until more

discussed in this paper, longer baselines are necessary to refine the
radial-velocity fit and derive planetary parameters. The radial-velocity time
series of stars BD -114672 and HIP 21934 are also analysed and their behaviour

field theories. We find that the measured Helium-4 abundances put a bound of -1
% <~ d m_q/m_q <~ 0.7 % on a possible variation of quark masses. The effect of
quark mass variations on the deuterium abundances can be largely compensated by
changes of the baryon-to-photon ratio eta. Including bounds on the variation of
eta coming from WMAP results and adding some additional assumptions further
narrows the range of allowed values of d m_q/m_q.

stochastic or chaotic processes. In recent years, quite a few methods have been
proposed to transform a single time series to a complex network so that the
dynamics of the process can be understood by investigating the topological
properties of the network. We study the topological properties of horizontal
visibility graphs constructed from fractional Brownian motions with different
Hurst index $H\in(0,1)$. Special attention has been paid to the impact of Hurst
index on the topological properties. It is found that the clustering
coefficient $C$ decreases when $H$ increases. We also found that the mean
length $L$ of the shortest paths increases exponentially with $H$ for fixed
length $N$ of the original time series. In addition, $L$ increases linearly
with respect to $N$ when $H$ is close to 1 and in a logarithmic form when $H$
is close to 0. Although the occurrence of different motifs changes with $H$,
the motif rank pattern remains unchanged for different $H$. Adopting the
node-covering box-counting method, the horizontal visibility graphs are found
to be fractals and the fractal dimension $d_B$ decreases with $H$. Furthermore,
the Pearson coefficients of the networks are positive and the degree-degree
correlations increase with the degree, which indicate that the horizontal
visibility graphs are assortative. With the increase of $H$, the Pearson
coefficient decreases first and then increases, in which the turning point is
around $H=0.6$. The presence of both fractality and assortativity in the
horizontal visibility graphs converted from fractional Brownian motions is
different from many cases where fractal networks are usually disassortative.

Lambda_s to a final precision of 1%. The capture rate determines the nucleon's

published and the final analysis of the full statistics will reduce the error
by a factor of up to 3. Muon capture on the deuteron probes the weak axial
current in the two-nucleon system. Within the framework of effective field
theories the calculation of such two-nucleon processes involving the axial
current requires the knowledge of one additional low energy constant which can
be extracted from the doublet capture rate Lambda_d. The same constant then
allows to model-independently calculate related processes such as solar
pp-fusion or neutrino-deuteron scattering. The MuSun experiment will deduce
Lambda_d to better than 1.5%. The experiment uses the MuCap detection setup

$B$ is a difficult task because of the low H\""older regularity index of its

stochastic calculus with respect to $B$, or to solving differential equations
driven by $B$. We intend to show in a forthcoming series of papers how to
desingularize iterated integrals by a weak singular non-Gaussian perturbation

  Convergence is proved by using ""standard"" tools of constructive field theory,

allow optimal estimates of the moments and call for an extension of the
Gaussian tools such as for instance the Malliavin calculus. This first paper

solved in a convex and tractable fashion, by recasting the SRM problem as a
semidefinite program (SDP). The SRM problem we solve is under the premise of
perfect channel state information (CSI). This paper also deals with the
imperfect CSI case. We consider a worst-case robust SRM formulation under
spherical CSI uncertainties, and we develop an optimal solution to it, again
via SDP. Moreover, our analysis reveals that transmit beamforming is generally
the optimal transmit strategy for SRM of the considered scenario, for both the
perfect and imperfect CSI cases. Simulation results are provided to illustrate
the secrecy-rate performance gains of the proposed SDP solutions compared to

the special problem structure, we shall derive an equivalent Bellman equation

Pursuit (S-OMP) procedure for sparsistant variable selection in ultra-high
dimensional multi-task regression problems. Screening of variables, as
introduced in \cite{fan08sis}, is an efficient and highly scalable way to
remove many irrelevant variables from the set of all variables, while retaining
all the relevant variables. S-OMP can be applied to problems with hundreds of
thousands of variables and once the number of variables is reduced to a
manageable size, a more computationally demanding procedure can be used to
identify the relevant variables for each of the regression outputs. To our
knowledge, this is the first attempt to utilize relatedness of multiple outputs
to perform fast screening of relevant variables. As our main theoretical
contribution, we prove that, asymptotically, S-OMP is guaranteed to reduce an
ultra-high number of variables to below the sample size without losing true
relevant variables. We also provide formal evidence that a modified Bayesian
information criterion (BIC) can be used to efficiently determine the number of
iterations in S-OMP. We further provide empirical evidence on the benefit of
variable selection using multiple regression outputs jointly, as opposed to
performing variable selection for each output separately. The finite sample
performance of S-OMP is demonstrated on extensive simulation studies, and on a
genetic association mapping problem. $Keywords$ Adaptive Lasso; Greedy forward

these two column operators mix with each other but are decoupled from operators
with $n\ne 2$ columns. The planar approximation does not capture the large N

numerically. All eigenvalues are an integer multiple of $8g_{YM}^2$ and there

these effects are influenced by a polarization asymmetry of the electrodes, the
dimensionality of the array, the temperature, resistance or charge disorder and
long-range interactions. We show that the magnitude and voltage dependence of
the TMR does not change with the dimensionality of the array or the presence of
junction resistance disorder. A different polarization in the electrodes
modifies the peak shape in the I-V and TMR curves but not their order of
magnitude. Increasing the temperature or length of the interaction reduces to
some extent the size of the peaks, being the reduction due to long-range
interactions smaller in longer arrays. Charge disorder should be avoided to
observe large TMR values.

strategic game reach a socially good state. A possible way to cope with
selfishness is to compute a desired outcome (if it is tractable) and impose it.
However this answer is often inappropriate because compelling an agent can be
costly, unpopular or just hard to implement. Since both situations (no
coordination and full coordination) show opposite advantages and drawbacks, it
is natural to study possible tradeoffs. In this paper we study a strategic game
where the nodes of a simple graph G are independent agents who try to form
pairs: e.g. jobs and applicants, tennis players for a match, etc. In many
instances of the game, a Nash equilibrium significantly deviates from a social
optimum. We analyze a scenario where we fix the strategy of some players; the
other players are free to make their choice. The goal is to compel a minimum
number of players and guarantee that any possible equilibrium of the modified
game is a social optimum, i.e. created pairs must form a maximum matching of G.
We mainly show that this intriguing problem is NP-hard and propose an
approximation algorithm with a constant ratio.

understanding behavior and its neural basis requires a simpler description.
Traditionally, simplification has been imposed by training animals to engage in
a limited set of behaviors, by hand scoring behaviors into discrete classes, or
by limiting the sensory experience of the organism. An alternative is to ask
whether we can search through the dynamics of natural behaviors to find
explicit evidence that these behaviors are simpler than they might have been.
We review two mathematical approaches to simplification, dimensionality
reduction and the maximum entropy method, and we draw on examples from
different levels of biological organization, from the crawling behavior of C.
elegans to the control of smooth pursuit eye movements in primates, and from
the coding of natural scenes by networks of neurons in the retina to the rules
of English spelling. In each case, we argue that the explicit search for
simplicity uncovers new and unexpected features of the biological system, and
that the evidence for simplification gives us a language with which to phrase
new questions for the next generation of experiments. The fact that similar
mathematical structures succeed in taming the complexity of very different
biological systems hints that there is something more general to be discovered.

used, via both the observational data of Sloan Digital Sky Survey and a widely
used theoretical stellar population model. Results. Some correlations between
widely used absorption line indices and ugriz colours are found from both
observational data of early-type galaxies and a theoretical simple stellar

line indices of early-type galaxies can be estimated from their colours using
correlations between absorption line indices and colours. For example,
age-sensitive absorption line indices can be estimated from (u-r) or (g-r)
colours and metallicity-sensitive ones from (u - z) or (g - z). This is useful
for studying the stellar populations of distant galaxies, especially for

that achieves magnetization switching with a smaller static field. This method
is based on optimal control and renders an exact solution for the 3D microwave
field that triggers the switching of a nanomagnet with a given anisotropy and
in an oblique static field. Applying this technique to the particular case of
uniaxial anisotropy, we show that the optimal microwave field, that achieves
switching with minimal absorbed energy, is modulated both in frequency and in
magnitude. Its role is to drive the magnetization from the metastable
equilibrium position towards the saddle point and then damping induces the
relaxation to the stable equilibrium position. For the pumping to be efficient,
the microwave field frequency must match at the early stage of the switching
process the proper precession frequency of the magnetization, which depends on
the magnitude and direction of the static field. We investigate the effect of
the static field (in amplitude and direction) and of damping on the
characteristics of the microwave field. We have computed the switching curves
in the presence of the optimal microwave field. The results are in qualitative
agreement with micro-SQUID experiments on isolated nanoclusters. The strong
dependence of the microwave field and that of the switching curve on the
damping parameter may be useful in probing damping in various nanoclusters.

between 6 and 8 p.m. This lifetime is a new indicator how much attention of
drivers is demanded in given traffic conditions.

embedding problem has the property that it maximizes (resp., minimizes) the law
of the maximum of the stopped process. We show that these constructions have a
wider property in that they also maximize (and minimize) expected values for a
more general class of bivariate functions $F(W_{\tau},S_{\tau})$ depending on
the joint law of the stopped process and the maximum. Moreover, for monotonic
functions $g$, they also maximize and minimize $\mathbb
{E}[\int_0^{\tau}g(S_t)\,dt]$ amongst embeddings of $\mu$, although, perhaps
surprisingly, we show that for increasing $g$ the Az\'{e}ma-Yor embedding
minimizes this quantity, and the Perkins embedding maximizes it. For
$g(s)=s^{-2}$ we show how these results are useful in calculating model
independent bounds on the prices of variance swaps. Along the way we also
consider whether $\mu_n$ converges weakly to $\mu$ is a sufficient condition
for the associated Az\'{e}ma-Yor and Perkins stopping times to converge. In the
case of the Az\'{e}ma-Yor embedding, if the potentials at zero also converge,
then the stopping times converge almost surely, but for the Perkins embedding
this need not be the case. However, under a further condition on the
convergence of atoms at zero, the Perkins stopping times converge in
probability (and hence converge almost surely down a subsequence).

units may be utilized, for example, to solve time dependent partial
differential equations by the Fourier split operator method. In this
contribution, we demonstrate that graphics processing units are capable to
calculate fast Fourier transforms much more efficiently than traditional
central processing units. Thus, graphics processing units render efficient
implementations of the Fourier split operator method possible. Performance
gains of more than an order of magnitude as compared to implementations for
traditional central processing units are reached in the solution of the time

gene in a population of haploid individuals subjected to mutations. We show in
this paper that this model can be mapped into an influence dynamical process on
networks subjected to external influences. The panmictic case considered by
Moran corresponds to fully connected networks and can be completely solved in
terms of hypergeometric functions. Other types of networks correspond to
structured populations, for which approximate solutions are also available.
This new approach to the classic Moran model leads to a relation between
regular networks based on spatial grids and the mechanism of isolation by
distance. We discuss the consequences of this connection for topopatric
speciation and the theory of neutral speciation and biodiversity. We show that
the effect of mutations in structured populations, where individuals can mate
only with neighbors, is greatly enhanced with respect to the panmictic case. If
mating is further constrained by genetic proximity between individuals, a
balance of opposing tendencies take place: increasing diversity promoted by
enhanced effective mutations versus decreasing diversity promoted by similarity
between mates. Stabilization occurs with speciation via pattern formation. We
derive an explicit relation involving the parameters characterizing the
population that indicates when speciation is possible.

baryonic matter appears to be associated with the condensation energy gained by
