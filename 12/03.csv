cluster NGC6397, we analyse and discuss the chemical compositions of a large
number of elements in 21 red giant branch stars. High-resolution spectra were
obtained with the FLAMES/UVES spectrograph on VLT. We have determined non-LTE
abundances of Na and LTE abundances for the remaining 21 elements, including O,
Mg, Al, alpha, iron-peak, and neutron-capture elements, many of which have not
previously been analysed for this cluster. We have also considered the
influence of possible He enrichment in the analysis of stellar spectra. We find
that the Na abundances of evolved, as well as unevolved, stars show a distinct
bimodality, which suggests the presence of two stellar populations; one
primordial stellar generation with composition similar to field stars, and a
second generation that is enriched in material processed through
hydrogen-burning (enriched in Na and Al and depleted in O and Mg). The cluster
is dominated (75%) by the second generation. The red giant branch show a
similar bimodal distribution in the Stroemgren colour index c_y=c_1-(b-y),
implying a large difference also in N abundance. The two populations have the
same composition of all analysed elements heavier than Al, within the
measurement uncertainty of the analysis, with the possible exception of [Y/Fe].
Using two stars with close to identical stellar parameters, one from each
generation, we estimate the difference in He content, Delta Y=0.01+-0.06, given
the assumption that the mass fraction of iron is the same for the stars.
Finally, we show that winds from fast rotating massive stars of the first
generation can be held responsible for the abundance patterns observed in
NGC6397 second generation long-lived stars and estimate that the initial mass
of the cluster were at least ten times higher than its present-day value.

interaction strength at which a polarised phase of molecules becomes the

structured in time spike trains. During further processing in higher areas,
information is subjected to a certain condensation process, which results in
formation of abstract conceptual images of external world, apparently,
represented as certain uniform spiking activity partially independent on the
input spike trains details. Possible physical mechanism of condensation at the
level of individual neuron was discussed recently. In a reverberating spiking
neural network, due to this mechanism the dynamics should settle down to the
same uniform/periodic activity in response to a set of various inputs. Since
the same periodic activity may correspond to different input spike trains, we
interpret this as possible candidate for information condensation mechanism in
a network. Our purpose is to test this possibility in a network model
consisting of five fully connected neurons, particularly, the influence of
geometric size of the network, on its ability to condense information. Dynamics
of 20 spiking neural networks of different geometric sizes are modelled by
means of computer simulation. Each network was propelled into reverberating
dynamics by applying various initial input spike trains. We run the dynamics
until it becomes periodic. The Shannon's formula is used to calculate the
amount of information in any input spike train and in any periodic state found.
As a result, we obtain explicit estimate of the degree of information
condensation in the networks, and conclude that it depends strongly on the
net's geometric size.

operation since. From its distant orbit around L2 it needs to transmit a huge
quantity of information through a very limited bandwidth. This is especially
true for the PACS imaging camera which needs to compress its data far more than
what can be achieved with lossless compression. This is currently solved by
including lossy averaging and rounding steps on board. Recently, a new theory
called compressed-sensing emerged from the statistics community. This theory
makes use of the sparsity of natural (or astrophysical) images to optimize the
acquisition scheme of the data needed to estimate those images. Thus, it can
lead to high compression factors.
  A previous article by Bobin et al. (2008) showed how the new theory could be
applied to simulated Herschel/PACS data to solve the compression requirement of
the instrument. In this article, we show that compressed-sensing theory can
indeed be successfully applied to actual Herschel/PACS data and give
significant improvements over the standard pipeline. In order to fully use the
redundancy present in the data, we perform full sky map estimation and
decompression at the same time, which cannot be done in most other compression
methods. We also demonstrate that the various artifacts affecting the data
(pink noise, glitches, whose behavior is a priori not well compatible with
compressed-sensing) can be handled as well in this new framework. Finally, we
make a comparison between the methods from the compressed-sensing scheme and
data acquired with the standard compression scheme. We discuss improvements
that can be made on ground for the creation of sky maps from the data.

Boltzmann statistics for the photons involved as well as the interacting

statistics of the photon energy distribution. These corrections can be deduced
directly from the detailed-balance condition without the assumption of
equilibrium as long as the photons are represented by a Planck spectrum.
Moreover we show that these corrections affect not only the photodisintegration
rates but also modify the conditions of nuclear statistical equilibrium as
represented in the Saha equation. We deduce new analytic corrections to the
classical Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics which can easily be added to the reverse
reaction rates of existing reaction network tabulations. We show that the
effects of quantum statistics, though generally quite small, always tend to
speed up photodisintegration rates and are largest for nuclei and environments
for which Q/kT ~ 1. As an illustration, we examine possible effects of these
corrections on the r-process, the rp-process, explosive silicon burning, the
$\gamma$-process and big bang nucleosynthesis. We find that in most cases one
is quite justified in neglecting these corrections. The correction is largest
for reactions near the drip line for an r-process with very high neutron

solvability of a mathematical problem as a complex decomposition problem. The
decomposition breaks the data into a simple part and a complex part. The simple
part is the solvable part by the method prescribed in the problem definition.
The complex part is the leftover of the simple part. Complex part can be viewed
as the ""residual"" of data or operator. It should be interpreted and not to be
discarded as useless. We will give different examples to illustrate the more

give a prototypical definition of supersymmetric D-branes of A-type (i.e.
A-branes) -- in an appropriate region of the Wilson's theory-space of string

cross sections at $\sqrt s=7$ TeV and the decay branching ratios, including all

the parametrization of the parton distribution functions as well as the
uncertainties which arise due to the use of an effective field theory in the
calculation of the next-to-next-to-leading order corrections. The parametric
uncertainties stemming from the values of the strong coupling constant and the
heavy quark masses in the Higgs decay branching ratios, which turn out to be
non-negligible, are also discussed. The implications for different center of

lepton or $b$-quark pairs, $gg, b\bar b \to {\rm Higgs} \to \tau^+\tau^-,b\bar

use the solution to expose a previously unknown and large class of quantum
states which we prove can be sampled efficiently and exactly. This general
framework of categorical tensor network states, where a combination of generic
and algebraically defined tensors appear, enhances the theory of tensor network
states.

collectively. This process occurs much deeper than the conventional
matter-induced MSW effect and hence may have an impact on nucleosynthesis. In
this paper we explore the effects of collective neutrino oscillations on the
r-process, using representative late-time neutrino spectra and outflow models.
We find that accurate modeling of the collective oscillations is essential for
this analysis. As an illustration, the often-used ""single-angle"" approximation
makes grossly inaccurate predictions for the yields in our setup. With the
proper multiangle treatment, the effect of the oscillations is found to be less
dramatic, but still significant. Since the oscillation patterns are sensitive
to the details of the emitted fluxes and the sign of the neutrino mass
hierarchy, so are the r-process yields. The magnitude of the effect also
depends sensitively on the astrophysical conditions - in particular on the
interplay between the time when nuclei begin to exist in significant numbers
and the time when the collective oscillation begins. A more definitive
understanding of the astrophysical conditions, and accurate modeling of the
collective oscillations for those conditions, is necessary.

leading twist. These soft-gluon rescattering effect produce single-spin
asymmetries, the breakdown of the Lam-Tung relation in Drell-Yan reactions, as
well as diffractive deep inelastic scattering, The antishadowing of nuclear
structure functions is predicted to depend on the flavor quantum numbers of
each quark and antiquark. Isolated hadrons can be produced at large transverse
momentum directly within a hard higher-twist QCD subprocess, rather than from
jet fragmentation, even at the LHC. Such ""direct"" processes can explain the
observed deviations from pQCD predictions of the power-law fall-off of
inclusive hadron cross sections as well as the ""baryon anomaly"" seen in
high-centrality heavy-ion collisions at RHIC. The intrinsic charm contribution
to the proton structure function at high x can explain the large rate for high
p_T photon plus charm-jet events observed at the Tevatron and imply a large
production rate for charm and bottom jets at high p_T at the LHC, as well as a
novel mechanism for Higgs and Z^0 production at high x_F. The light-front
wavefunctions derived in AdS/QCD can be used to calculate jet hadronization at
the amplitude level. The elimination of the renormalization scale ambiguity for
the QCD coupling using the scheme-independent BLM method will increase the
sensitivity of searches for new physics at the LHC. The implications of
""in-hadron condensates"" for the QCD contribution to the cosmological constant
are also discussed.

varying the switching temperature at which the hydrodynamic output is converted
to particles for further propagation with the Boltzmann cascade we test the
ability of the macroscopic hydrodynamic approach to emulate the microscopic
evolution during the hadronic stage and extract the temperature dependence of
the effective shear viscosity of the hadron resonance gas produced in the

history and hence do not represent fundamental transport properties of the

a faithful description of hadron resonance gas dynamics with predictive power,

gravitational encounters and physical collisions between single planetesimals.
In recent years, many binary planetesimals have been observed in the Solar

studies of planetesimal disks formation and evolution do not account for the
role of binaries. Here we point out that gravitational encounters of binary
planetesimals can have an important role in the evolution of planetesimal
disks. Binary planetesimals catalyze close encounters between planetesimals,
and can strongly enhance their collision rate. Binaries may also serve as
additional heating source of the planetesimal disk, through the exchange of the
binaries gravitational potential energy into the kinetic energy of
planetesimals in the disk.

planetesimals of different sizes/shapes experience different drag forces from
the gas at these stage. Such differential forces produce a wind-shearing effect
between close by, different size planetesimals. For any two planetesimals, a
wind-shearing radius can be considered, at which the differential acceleration
due to the wind becomes greater than the mutual gravitational pull between the
planetesimals. We find that the wind-shearing radius could be much smaller than
the gravitational shearing radius by the Sun (the Hill radius), i.e. during the

perturbations by the Sun. Here we study the wind-shearing radii for

shearing (drag force vs. gravitational tidal forces). We then discuss the role

planetary formation and evolution routes may exist in old evolved binary
systems. Here we discuss the implications of binary stellar evolution on
planetary systems. In these binary systems stellar evolution could lead to the
formation of symbiotic stars, where mass is lost from one star and could be
transferred to its binary companion, and may form an accretion disk around it.
This raises the possibility that such a disk could provide the necessary
environment for the formation of a new, second generation of planets in both
circumstellar or circumbinary configurations. Pre-existing first generation
planets surviving the post-MS evolution of such systems would be dynamically
effected by the mass loss in the systems and may also interact with the newly
formed disk. Second generation planetary systems should be typically found in
white dwarf binary systems, and may show various observational signatures. Most
notably, second generation planets could form in environment which are
inaccessible, or less favorable, for first generation planets. The orbital
phase space available for the second generation planets could be forbidden (in
terms of the system stability) to first generation planets in the pre-evolved
progenitor binaries. Observations of exo-planets in such forbidden or
unfavorable regions could possibly serve to uniquely identify their second
generation character. Finally, we point out a few observed candidate second
generation planetary systems, including Gl 86, HD 27442 and all of the

~1 pc of Sgr A*; 2) the pulsar would be recycled, with a period of ~1 to a few
tens of milliseconds, and a low magnetic field B<~10^10 G; 3) the binary would
have high eccentricity, e~0.8, but with a large scatter; and 4) the binary
would be relatively wide, with semi-major axis a_b~0.1 - >~3 AU. The potential
discovery of a PSR-BH binary therefore provides a strong motivation for deep,
high-frequency radio searches for recycled pulsars toward the Galactic center.

accretion of small particles in planetary atmospheres, gas accretion onto

the gaseous disk and the swarm of planetesimals. To validate the N-body portion
of the algorithm, we use a battery of tests in planetary dynamics. As a first
application of the complete code, we consider the evolution of Pluto-mass
planetesimals in a swarm of 0.1-1 cm pebbles. In a typical evolution time of
1-3 Myr, our calculations transform 0.01-0.1 solar mass disks of gas and dust
into planetary systems containing super-Earths, Saturns, and Jupiters. Low mass
planets form more often than massive planets; disks with smaller alpha form
more massive planets than disks with larger alpha. For Jupiter-mass planets,
masses of solid cores are 10-100 Earth masses.

increases of several magnitudes in the blue/near-UV. These frequent, powerful
events, which are caused by magnetic reconnection, will have a strong
observational signature in large, time-domain surveys. The radiation and
particle fluxes from flares may also exert a significant influence on the
atmospheres of orbiting planets, and affect their habitability. We present a
statistical model of flaring M dwarfs in the Galaxy that allows us to predict
the observed flare rate along a given line of sight for a particular survey
depth and cadence. The parameters that enter the model are the Galactic
structure, the distribution of magnetically active and inactive M dwarfs, and
the flare frequency distribution (FFD) of both populations. The FFD is a
function of spectral type, activity, and Galactic height. Although inactive M
dwarfs make up the majority of stars in a magnitude-limited survey, the FFD of
inactive stars is very poorly constrained. We have organized a flare monitoring
campaign comprising hundreds of hours of new observations from both the ground
and space to better constrain flare rates. Incorporating the new observations
into our model provides more accurate predictions of stellar variability caused
by flares on M dwarfs. We pay particular attention to the likelihood of flares
appearing as optical transients (i.e., host star not seen in quiescent data).

Rossiter- Mclaughlin (RM) measurements have revealed hot Jupiters in
high-obliquity orbits. In addition, direct-imaging has discovered giant planets
at large (~ 100 AU) separations via direct-imaging technique. Simple-minded
disk-migration scenarios are inconsistent with the high-inclination (and even
retrograde) orbits as seen in recent RM measurements. Furthermore, forming
giant planets at large semi-major axis (a) may be challenging in the
core-accretion paradigm. We perform many N-body simulations to explore the two
above-mentioned orbital architectures. Planet-planet scattering in a
multi-planet system can naturally excite orbital inclinations. Planets can also
get scattered to large distances. Large-a planetary orbits created from
planet-planet scattering are expected to have high eccentricities (e).
Theoretical models predict that the observed long-period planets, such as
Fomalhaut-b have moderate e \approx 0.3. Interestingly, these are also in
systems with disks. We find that if a massive-enough outer disk is present, a
scattered planet may be circularized at large a via dynamical friction from the
disk and repeated scattering of the disk particles.

2009, as well as archival spectra from the International Ultraviolet Explorer

detected in the 1997 GHRS and 2009 COS spectra - of these, four are associated
with high-velocity clouds in the interstellar medium, four are at
low-significance, and the remaining four are intrinsic features, which vary
between the GHRS and COS observations. The strongest intrinsic absorber in the
1997 spectrum has a systemic velocity of ~ -4250 km/s. The corresponding
feature in the COS data is five times weaker than the GHRS absorber. The three
additional weak (equivalent width from 13-54 mA) intrinsic Ly-alpha absorbers
are at systemic velocities of -4100 km/s, -3550 km/s, and -2600 km/s. However,
intrinsic absorption troughs from highly ionized C IV and N V, are not detected
in the COS observations. No ionized absorption signatures are detected in the ~
14 ks XMM-Newton EPIC spectra. The factor of five change in the intrinsic
Ly$\alpha$ absorber is most likely due to bulk motions in the absorber, since
there is no drastic change in the UV luminosity of the source from the GHRS to
the COS observations. In a study of variability of Mrk 817, we find that the
X-ray luminosity varies by a factor of ~40 over 20 years, while the UV
continuum/emission lines vary by at most a factor of ~2.3 over 30 years. The
variability of the X-ray luminosity is strongly correlated with the X-ray
power-law index, but no correlation is found with the simultaneous optical/UV
photometry.

and compute the gravitational waves (GWs) emitted in the core bounce phase of
three representative models via multiple techniques. The simplest technique,
the quadrupole formula (QF), estimates the GW content in the spacetime from the
mass quadrupole tensor. It is strictly valid only in the weak-field and
slow-motion approximation. For the first time, we apply GW extraction methods
in core collapse that are fully curvature-based and valid for strongly
radiating and highly relativistic sources. We employ three extraction methods
computing (i) the Newman-Penrose (NP) scalar Psi_4, (ii)
Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli-Moncrief (RWZM) master functions, and (iii)
Cauchy-Characteristic Extraction (CCE) allowing for the extraction of GWs at
future null infinity, where the spacetime is asymptotically flat and the GW
content is unambiguously defined. The latter technique is the only one not
suffering from residual gauge and finite-radius effects. All curvature-based
methods suffer from strong non-linear drifts. We employ the fixed-frequency
integration technique as a high-pass waveform filter. Using the CCE results as
a benchmark, we find that finite-radius NP extraction yields results that agree
nearly perfectly in phase, but differ in amplitude by ~1-7% at core bounce,
depending on the model. RWZM waveforms, while in general agreeing in phase,
contain spurious high-frequency noise of comparable amplitudes to those of the
relatively weak GWs emitted in core collapse. We also find remarkably good
agreement of the waveforms obtained from the QF with those obtained from CCE.
They agree very well in phase but systematically underpredict peak amplitudes
by ~5-11% which is comparable to the NP results and is within the uncertainties
associated with core collapse physics. (abridged)

astrophysics, occurs in thermally and compositionally stratified systems which
are stable according to the Ledoux-criterion but unstable according to the
Schwarzchild criterion. This process has been given relatively little attention
so far, and its properties remain poorly constrained. In this paper, we present
and analyze a set of three-dimensional simulations of this phenomenon in a
Cartesian domain under the Boussinesq approximation. We find that in some cases
the double-diffusive convection saturates into a state of homogeneous
turbulence, but with turbulent fluxes several orders of magnitude smaller than
those expected from direct overturning convection. In other cases the system
rapidly and spontaneously develops closely-packed thermo-compositional layers,
which later successively merge until a single layer is left. We compare the
output of our simulations with an existing theory of layer formation in the
oceanographic context, and find very good agreement between the model and our
results. The thermal and compositional mixing rates increase significantly
during layer formation, and increase even further with each merger. We find
that the heat flux through the staircase is a simple function of the layer
height. We conclude by proposing a new approach to studying transport by
double-diffusive convection in astrophysics.

the challenge of solving an ill-posed inverse problem, where the number of
available measurements is smaller than the dimension of the model to be
estimated. However in many practical situations of interest, models are
constrained structurally so that they only have a few degrees of freedom
relative to their ambient dimension. This paper provides a general framework to
convert notions of simplicity into convex penalty functions, resulting in
convex optimization solutions to linear, underdetermined inverse problems. The
class of simple models considered are those formed as the sum of a few atoms
from some (possibly infinite) elementary atomic set; examples include
well-studied cases such as sparse vectors and low-rank matrices, as well as
several others including sums of a few permutations matrices, low-rank tensors,
orthogonal matrices, and atomic measures. The convex programming formulation is
based on minimizing the norm induced by the convex hull of the atomic set; this
norm is referred to as the atomic norm. The facial structure of the atomic norm
ball carries a number of favorable properties that are useful for recovering
simple models, and an analysis of the underlying convex geometry provides sharp
estimates of the number of generic measurements required for exact and robust
recovery of models from partial information. These estimates are based on
computing the Gaussian widths of tangent cones to the atomic norm ball. When
the atomic set has algebraic structure the resulting optimization problems can
be solved or approximated via semidefinite programming. The quality of these
approximations affects the number of measurements required for recovery. Thus
this work extends the catalog of simple models that can be recovered from
limited linear information via tractable convex programming.

points in the Euclidean plane in the presence of a transportation network. A
transportation network consists of a planar network where each road (edge) has
an individual speed. A traveller may enter and exit the network at any point on
the roads. Along any road the traveller moves with a fixed speed depending on
the road, and outside the network the traveller moves at unit speed in any
direction. We give an exact algorithm for the basic version of the problem:
given a transportation network of total complexity n in the Euclidean plane, a
source point s and a destination point t, and the quickest path between s and
t. We also show how the transportation network can be preprocessed in time
O(n^2 log n) into a data structure of size O(n^2) such that (1 +
\epsilon)-approximate cheapest path cost queries between any two points in the
plane can be answered in time O(1\epsilon^4 log n).

measured at high (terrestrial) and low (interstellar) matter densities as
predicted by chameleon-like scalar field models - candidates to the dark energy

information theoretic measures of the quantum phase transitions in these models
such as concurrence, entanglement entropy, quantum discord and quantum
fidelity. We then focus on non-equilibrium dynamics of a variety of transverse

quenching studies, we dwell on slow dynamics and discuss the Kibble-Zurek

its modifications for quenching across critical lines, gapless regions and

using a strict 1/Nc expansion scheme. The parameters of the nonlocal model are
refitted so that the physical values of the pion mass and the weak pion decay
constant are obtained. The size of the 1/Nc correction to the quark condensate
is carefully studied and compared with the usual local Nambu-Jona-Lasinio
model. It is found that even the sign of the corrections can be different. This
can be attributed to the mesonic cut-off of the local model. The model is also
applied to finite temperature. We find that the 1/Nc corrections dominate the
melting of the chiral condensate at low temperatures, T<100 MeV, in agreement
with chiral perturbation theory. On the other hand, the relative importance of
the 1/Nc corrections in the cross-over regime depends on the parameter T0 of
the Polyakov loop potential. For T0=270 MeV, corresponding to a fit of lattice
data for pure gluodynamics, the correction terms are large and lead to a
lowering of the chiral phase transition temperature in comparison with the
mean-field result. Near the phase transition the 1/Nc expansion breaks down and
a non-perturbative scheme is needed to include mesonic correlations in that
regime. Lowering T0 leads to a more rapid cross-over even at the mean-field
level and the unstable region for the 1/Nc corrections shrinks. For T0< 220 MeV
the temperatures of deconfinement and chiral restoration are practically
synchronized.

relatively to our Sun. In order to better constrain how these heavy elements

could not sink deep into the planets. On the basis of the ""Nice model"", we
obtain accreted masses (in terrestrial units) equal to $0.15\pm0.04
\rm\,M_\oplus$ for Jupiter, and $0.08 \pm 0.01 \rm\,M_\oplus$ for Saturn. For
the two other giant planets, the results are found to depend mostly on whether
they switched position during the instability phase. For Uranus, the accreted
mass is $0.051 \pm 0.003 \rm\,M_\oplus$ with an inversion and $0.030 \pm 0.001
\rm\,M_\oplus$ without an inversion. Neptune accretes $0.048 \pm 0.015
\rm\,M_\oplus$ in models in which it is initially closer to the Sun than
Uranus, and $0.066 \pm 0.006 \rm\,M_\oplus$ otherwise. With well-mixed
envelopes, this corresponds to an increase in the enrichment over the solar
value of $0.033 \pm 0.001$ and $0.074 \pm 0.007$ for Jupiter and Saturn,
respectively. For the two other planets, we find the enrichments to be $2.1 \pm
1.4$ (w/ inversion) or $1.2 \pm 0.7$ (w/o inversion) for Uranus, and $2.0 \pm
1.2$ (w/ inversion) or $2.7 \pm 1.6$ (w/o inversion) for Neptune. This is
clearly insufficient to explain the inferred enrichments of $\sim 4$ for
Jupiter, $\sim 7$ for Saturn and $\sim 45$ for Uranus and Neptune.

microgel, is addressed through extensive rheological measurements coupled to
simultaneous temporally and spatially resolved velocimetry. These combined
measurements allow us to rule out any bulk fracture-like scenario during the
fluidization process such as that suggested in [Caton {\it et al., Rheol Acta},
2008, {\bf 47}, 601-607]. On the contrary, we observe that the transient regime
from solidlike to liquidlike behaviour under a constant shear stress $\sigma$
successively involves creep deformation, total wall slip, and shear banding
before a homogeneous steady state is reached. Interestingly, the total duration
$\tau_f$ of this fluidization process scales as $\tau_f \propto 1/(\sigma -
\sigma_c)^{\beta}$, where $\sigma_c$ stands for the yield stress of the
microgel, and $\beta$ is an exponent which only depends on the microgel
properties and not on the gap width or on the boundary conditions. Together
with recent experiments under imposed shear rate [Divoux {\it et al., Phys.
Rev. Lett.}, 2010, {\bf 104}, 208301], this scaling law suggests a route to
rationalize the phenomenological Herschel-Bulkley (HB) power-law classically
used to describe the steady-state rheology of simple yield stress fluids. In
particular, we show that the {\it steady-state} HB exponent appears as the
ratio of the two fluidization exponents extracted separately from the {\it
transient} fluidization processes respectively under controlled shear rate and
under controlled shear stress.

deposition (CVD) has received a lot of attention recently. However, CVD
synthesis of AB stacked bi-layer graphene (BLG) is still a challenging work.
Here we report synthesis of BLG homogeneously in large area by thermal CVD. The
2D Raman band of CVD BLG splits into four components, suggesting splitting of
electronic bands due to strong interlayer coupling. The splitting of electronic
bands in CVD BLG is further evidenced by the study of near infrared (NIR)
absorption and carrier dynamics probed by transient absorption spectroscopy.
Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy invesigation also indiates CVD BLG
possesses different electronic structures from those of CVD SLG. The growth
mechanism of BLG is found to be related to catalystic activity of copper
(Cu)surface, which is determined by purity of Cu foils employed in CVD process.
Our work showsthat strongly coupled or even AB stacked BLG can be grown on Cu
foils in large scale, which isof particular importance for device applications
based on their split electronic bands

conductor of width W and length L >> W. Our aim is to compare an impurity-free
conductor with grain boundaries with a grain-free conductor with impurity
disorder. A single grain boundary is modeled as a set of the
2D-$\delta$-function-like barriers positioned equidistantly on a straight line
and disorder is emulated by a large number of such straight lines, intersecting
the conductor with random orientation in random positions. The impurity
disorder is modeled by the 2D $\delta$-barriers with the randomly chosen
positions and signs. The electron transmission through the wires is calculated
by the scattering-matrix method, and the Landauer conductance is obtained. We
calculate the persistent current in the rings threaded by magnetic flux: We
incorporate into the scattering-matrix method the flux-dependent cyclic
boundary conditions and we introduce a trick allowing to study the persistent
currents in rings of almost realistic size. We mainly focus on the numerical
results for L much larger than the electron mean-free path, when the transport
is diffusive. If the grain boundaries are weakly reflecting, the systems with
grain boundaries show the same (mean) conductance and the same (typical)
persistent current as the systems with impurities, and the results also agree
with the single-particle theories treating disorder as a white-noise-like
potential. If the grain boundaries are strongly reflecting, the typical
persistent currents can be about three times larger than the results of the
white-noise-based theory, thus resembling the experimental results of Jariwala
et al. (PRL 2001). We extend our study to the 3D conductors with columnar
grains. We find that the persistent current exceeds the white-noise-based
result by another one order of magnitude, similarly as in the experiment of
Chandrasekhar et al. (PRL 1991).

massive protostellar discs. Particularly strong is the global gravitational
instability, which arises when the disc mass is of order 0.1 of the mass of the
central star and has a characteristic spatial scale much greater than the
disc's vertical scale-height. In this paper we use three-dimensional numerical
hydrodynamics to study the development of gravitational instabilities in a disc
which is embedded in a dense, gaseous envelope. We find that global
gravitational instabilities are the dominant mode of angular momentum transport
in the disc with infall, in contrast to otherwise identical isolated discs. The
accretion torques created by low-order, global modes of the gravitational
instability in a disc subject to infall are larger by a factor of several than
an isolated disc of the same mass. We show that this global gravitational
instability is driven by the strong vertical shear at the interface between the
disc and the envelope, and suggest that this process may be an important means
of driving accretion on to young stars.

contacts, similar to the propagation of human and other biological viruses.
Recent work has employed models from epidemiology and complex networks to
analyse the spread of malware and the effect of patching specific nodes. These
approaches have adopted a static view of the mobile networks, i.e., by
aggregating all the edges that appear over time, which leads to an approximate
representation of the real interactions: instead, these networks are inherently
dynamic and the edge appearance and disappearance is highly influenced by the
ordering of the human contacts, something which is not captured at all by
existing complex network measures. In this paper we first study how the
blocking of malware propagation through immunisation of key nodes (even if
carefully chosen through static or temporal betweenness centrality metrics) is
ineffective: this is due to the richness of alternative paths in these
networks. Then we introduce a time-aware containment strategy that spreads a
patch message starting from nodes with high temporal closeness centrality and
show its effectiveness using three real-world datasets. Temporal closeness
allows the identification of nodes able to reach most nodes quickly: we show
that this scheme can reduce the cellular network resource consumption and
associated costs, achieving, at the same time, a complete containment of the
malware in a limited amount of time.

protosolar nebula has been a debate for a long time. Its importance stems from
the expected substantial jump in the abundance of solids beyond the snow line,
which is conducive to planet formation, and from the higher stickiness in
collisions of ice-coated dust grains, which may help the process of coagulation
of dust and the formation of planetesimals. In an optically thin nebula, the
location of the snow line is easily calculated to be around 3 AU. However, in
its first 5 to 10 million years, the solar nebula was optically thick, implying
a smaller snow line radius due to shielding from direct sunlight, but also a
larger radius because of viscous heating. Several models have attempted to
treat these opposing effects. However, until recently treatments beyond an
approximate 1+1D radiative transfer were unfeasible. We revisit the problem
with a fully self-consistent 3D treatment in an axisymmetric disk model,
including a density-dependent treatment of the dust and ice sublimation. We
find that the location of the snow line is very sensitive to the opacities of
the dust grains and the mass accretion rate of the disk. We show that previous
approximate treatments are quite efficient at determining the location of the
snow line if the energy budget is locally dominated by viscous accretion. We
derive an analytic estimate of the location of the snow line that compares very
well with results from this and previous studies. Using solar abundances of the
elements we compute the abundance of dust and ice and find that the expected
jump in solid surface density at the snow line is smaller than previously
assumed. We further show that in the inner few AU the refractory species are
partly evaporated, leading to a significantly smaller solid state surface
density in the regions where the rocky planets were formed.

thought to be due to energy loss by gluon radiation off hard partons in a QCD

give estimates of the coupling strength of the parton to the medium which
differ by a factor of $5$. We will present a side-by-side comparison of two
different formalisms to calculate the energy loss of light quarks and gluons:
the multiple soft scattering approximation (ASW-MS) and the opacity expansion
formalism (ASW-SH and WHDG-rad). A common time-temperature profile is used to
characterize the medium. The results are compared to the single hadron
suppression $R_{AA}$ at RHIC energies. In addition the influcence of
homogeneous and non-homogeneous distribution of scattering centers is
discussed. We find that using an equivalent brick overestimates the energy loss

distribution of labeled examples from the hypercube such that there exists a
monomial consistent with $(1-\eps)$ of the examples, it is NP-hard to find a
halfspace that is correct on $(1/2+\eps)$ of the examples, for arbitrary
constants $\eps > 0$. In learning theory terms, weak agnostic learning of
monomials is hard, even if one is allowed to output a hypothesis from the much
bigger concept class of halfspaces. This hardness result subsumes a long line
of previous results, including two recent hardness results for the proper
learning of monomials and halfspaces. As an immediate corollary of our result
we show that weak agnostic learning of decision lists is NP-hard.
  Our techniques are quite different from previous hardness proofs for
learning. We define distributions on positive and negative examples for
monomials whose first few moments match. We use the invariance principle to
argue that regular halfspaces (all of whose coefficients have small absolute
value relative to the total $\ell_2$ norm) cannot distinguish between
distributions whose first few moments match. For highly non-regular subspaces,
we use a structural lemma from recent work on fooling halfspaces to argue that
they are ``junta-like'' and one can zero out all but the top few coefficients
without affecting the performance of the halfspace. The top few coefficients
form the natural list decoding of a halfspace in the context of dictatorship
tests/Label Cover reductions.
  We note that unlike previous invariance principle based proofs which are only
known to give Unique-Games hardness, we are able to reduce from a version of
Label Cover problem that is known to be NP-hard. This has inspired follow-up
work on bypassing the Unique Games conjecture in some optimal geometric
inapproximability results.

turbulent interstellar medium (ISM) irradiated by a nearby O star. Our tests
demonstrate that the global ionisation properties of the region are correctly
reproduced by iVINE, hence validating further application of this code to the
study of feedback in star forming regions. However we highlight potentially
important discrepancies in the detailed temperature distribution. In particular
we show that in the case of highly inhomogenous density distributions the
commonly employed on-the-spot (OTS) approximation yields unrealistically sharp
shadow regions which can affect the dynamical evolution of the system. We
implement a simple strategy to include the effects of the diffuse field in
future calculations, which makes use of physically motivated temperature
calibrations of the diffuse-field dominated regions and can be readily applied
to similar codes. We find that while the global qualitative behaviour of the
system is captured by simulations with the OTS approximation, the inclusion of
the diffuse field in iVINE (called DiVINE) results in a stronger confinement of
the cold gas, leading to denser and less coherent structures. This in turn
leads to earlier triggering of star formation. We confirm that turbulence is
being driven in simulations that include the diffuse field, but the efficiency
is slightly lower than in simulations that use the OTS approximation.

operators we introduce the Fresnel operator for converting Caldirola-Kanai
Hamiltonian into time-independent harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian. The Fresnel
operator with the parameters A,B,C,D corresponds to classical optical Fresnel
transformation, these parameters are the solution to a set of partial
differential equations set up in the above mentioned converting process. In
this way the exact wavefunction solution of the Schr\""odinger equation governed
by the Caldirola-Kanai Hamiltonian is obtained, which represents a squeezed
number state. The corresponding Wigner function is derived by virtue of the
Weyl ordered form of the Wigner operator and the order-invariance of Weyl
ordered operators under similar transformations. The method used here can be
suitable for solving Schr\""odinger equation of other time-dependent
oscillators.

perfectly edge-on and a certain degree of opacity of the thin disk. We argue
that the subtlety of the thick disk is a consequence of either a limited

10^{6} K. The coronal energy budget and specifically possible mechanisms of
coronal heating (wave, DC-electric fields, ..) are poorly understood. This is
particularly true as far as the formation of X-ray bright points (BPs) is
concerned. Aims. Investigation of the energy budget with emphasis on the
relative role and contribution of adiabatic compression versus current
dissipation to the formation of coronal BPs. Methods. Three-dimensional
resistive MHD simulation starts with the extrapolation of the observed magnetic
field from SOHO/MDI magnetograms, which are associated with a BP observed on 19
December 2006 by Hinode. The initial radially non-uniform plasma density and
temperature distribution is in accordance with an equilibrium model of
chromosphere and corona. The plasma motion is included in the model as a source
of energy for coronal heating. Results. Investigation of the energy conversion
due to Lorentz force, pressure gradient force and Ohmic current dissipation for
this bright point shows the minor effect of Joule heating in comparison to the
work done by pressure gradient force in increasing the thermal energy by
adiabatic compression. Especially at the time when the temperature enhancement
above the bright point starts to form, compressional effects are quite dominant
over the direct Joule heating. Conclusions. Choosing non-realistic high
resistivity in compressible MHD models for simulation of solar corona can lead
to unphysical consequences for the energy balance analysis, especially when
local thermal energy enhancements are being considered.

energy nuclear collisions is the energy loss of (heavy) quarks. It has been
shown in experiments at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) that even
charm and bottom quarks, despite their high mass, experience a remarkable
medium suppression in the Quark Gluon Plasma. In this exploratory investigation
we study the energy loss of heavy quarks in high multiplicity proton-proton
collisions at LHC energies. Although the colliding systems are smaller than
compared to those at RHIC (p+p vs. Au+Au) the higher energy might lead to
multiplicities comparable to Cu+Cu collisions at RHIC. Recently the CMS
collaboration has shown that these particles likely interact among each other.
The interaction of charm quarks with this environment gives rise to a
non-negligible suppression of high momentum heavy quarks in elementary
collisions.

non-understanding) of exoplanet formation, structure and evolution, in the
light of the most recent discoveries. Recent observations of transiting massive
brown dwarfs seem to remarkably confirm the predicted theoretical mass-radius
relationship in this domain. This mass-radius relationship provides, in some
cases, a powerful diagnostic to distinguish planets from brown dwarfs of same
mass, as for instance for Hat-P-20b. If confirmed, this latter observation
shows that planet formation takes place up to at least 8 Jupiter masses.
Conversely, observations of brown dwarfs down to a few Jupiter masses in young,
low-extinction clusters strongly suggest an overlapping mass domain between
(massive) planets and (low-mass) brown dwarfs, i.e. no mass edge between these
two distinct (in terms of formation mechanism) populations. At last, the large
fraction of heavy material inferred for many of the transiting planets confirms
the core-accretion scenario as been the dominant one for planet formation.

we study the effect of interlayer shear on resonant frequencies f of graphene
nanostrips, via both molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and elastic model
analysis incorporating interlayer shear. Contrary to the classical thin beam
theory prediction f~nl^-2 (l is beam length and n layer number), MD simulation
results reveal very different dependences, f~l^-1.36 and f - fmono~(n-1)/n
(fmono is frequency of the monolayer beam). Interlayer shear modulus of
multilayer graphene strips is much smaller than their intralayer Young's
modulus, and the weak interlayer interaction can not maintain the registry
between the carbon atoms in adjacent layers. Large shear deformation occurs
during vibration of multilayer graphene nano-strips. Therefore we propose a
multi-beam shear model (MBSM) with the interlayer shear energy of multilayer
graphene nano-strips taken into account. It makes predictions consistent
excellently with direct MD simulations without any fitting parameter required.
The results are of importance for various applications of multi-layer graphene
nano-strips, such as in nano-electromechanical devices including resonators,
sensors and actuators, where interlayer shear has apparent impacts to
deformation, vibration, and energy dissipation processes.

measured. The discrimination of $\bar{u}+d$ and $\bar{d}+u$ quark combinations
requires distinguishing the charge sign of high $p_T$ electrons and positrons,

relies on the Time Projection Chamber. At forward rapidity, new tracking
capabilities will be provided by the Forward GEM Tracker, consisting of six
triple-GEM detectors which are under construction. The suppression of QCD
background over W boson signal events by several orders of magnitude is
accomplished by using the highly segmented STAR Electromagnetic Calorimeters to
impose isolation criteria suppressing jet events, and vetoing dijet events

for studying the nature of the matter surrounding the neutron star and the

the X-ray spectrum of 4U 1538-52 obtained by the XMM-Newton observatory and to
look for the presence of diagnostic lines in the energy range 0.3-11.5 keV.
Methods. We used a 54 ks PN & MOS/XMM-Newton observation of the high mass X-ray
binary 4U 1538-52 covering the orbital phase between 0.75 to 1.00 (the
eclipse-ingress). We have modelled the 0.3-11.5 keV continuum emission with
three absorbed power laws and looked for the emission lines. Results. We found
previously unreported recombination lines, in this system, at 2.4 keV, 1.9 keV
and 1.3 keV, consistent with the presence of highly ionized states of S XV He?,
Si XIII He? and Mg K? or Mg XI He?. On the other hand, both out of eclipse and
in eclipse we detect a fluorescence iron emission line at 6.4 keV which is
resolved into two components: a narrow ($\sigma \leq$ 10 eV) fluorescence Fe K?
line plus one hot line from highly photoionized Fe XXV. Conclusions. The
detection of new recombination lines during eclipse-ingress in 4U 1538-52

Bubble dynamics is described as an overdamped random walk in the number of

characterize the breathing process, and adopt the recently studied backward
Fokker-Planck method and the path decomposition method as elegant and flexible
tools for deriving these distributions. In particular, for a bubble of an
initial size $x_0$, we derive analytical expressions for (i) the distribution
$P(t_f|x_0)$ of the first-passage time $t_f$, characterizing the bubble
lifetime, (ii) the distribution $P(A|x_0)$ of the area $A$ till the
first-passage time, providing information about the effective reactivity of the
bubble to processes within the DNA, (iii) the distribution $P(M)$ of the
maximum bubble size $M$ attained before the first-passage time, and (iv) the
joint probability distribution $P(M,t_m)$ of the maximum bubble size $M$ and
the time $t_m$ of its occurrence before the first-passage time. These
distributions are analyzed in the limit of small and large bubble sizes. We
supplement our analytical predictions with direct numerical simulations of the
related Langevin equation, and obtain a very good agreement in the appropriate

quantum state are found to be a superpositions of the electric and noise

caused by linear absorption of the propagating modes. From the expressions for
