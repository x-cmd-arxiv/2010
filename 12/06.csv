namely, each node wishes to discover and identify the network interface
addresses (NIAs) of those nodes within a single hop. A novel paradigm, called
compressed neighbor discovery is proposed, which enables all nodes to
simultaneously discover their respective neighborhoods with a single frame of
transmission, which is typically of a few thousand symbol epochs. The key
technique is to assign each node a unique on-off signature and let all nodes
simultaneously transmit their signatures. Despite that the radios are
half-duplex, each node observes a superposition of its neighbors' signatures
(partially) through its own off-slots. To identify its neighbors out of a large
network address space, each node solves a compressed sensing (or sparse
recovery) problem.
  Two practical schemes are studied. The first employs random on-off
signatures, and each node discovers its neighbors using a noncoherent detection
algorithm based on group testing. The second scheme uses on-off signatures
based on a deterministic second-order Reed-Muller code, and applies a chirp
decoding algorithm. The second scheme needs much lower signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) to achieve the same error performance. The complexity of the chirp
decoding algorithm is sub-linear, so that it is in principle scalable to
networks with billions of nodes with 48-bit IEEE 802.11 MAC addresses. The
compressed neighbor discovery schemes are much more efficient than conventional
random-access discovery, where nodes have to retransmit over many frames with
random delays to be successfully discovered.

a consequence of the bonding/anti-bonding level repulsion of guided-wave

geometry consisting of a photonic-crystal (holey) membrane suspended above an
unpatterned layered substrate, supporting planar waveguide modes that can
couple via the periodic modulation of the holey membrane. Asymmetric geometries
have a clear advantage in ease of fabrication and experimental characterization
compared to symmetric double-membrane structures. We show that the asymmetry
can also lead to unusual behavior in the force magnitudes of a
bonding/antibonding pair as the membrane separation changes, including
nonmonotonic dependences on the separation. We propose a computational method
that obtains the entire force spectrum via a single time-domain simulation, by
Fourier-transforming the response to a short pulse and thereby obtaining the
frequency-dependent stress tensor. We point out that by operating with two,
instead of a single frequency, these evanescent forces can be exploited to tune
the spring constant of the membrane without changing its equilibrium
separation.

PhD thesis in 2010, and verified formally shortly afterwards. To a simply-typed
binding signature S over a fixed set T of object types we associate a category
called the category of representations of S. We show that this category has an
initial object Sigma(S). From its construction it will be clear that the object
Sigma(S) merits the name abstract syntax associated to S. Our theorem is
implemented and proved correct in the proof assistant Coq through heavy use of
dependent types. The approach through monads gives rise to an implementation of
syntax where both terms and variables are intrinsically typed, i.e. where the
object types are reflected in the meta-level types. This article is to be seen
as a research article rather than about the formalization of a classical
mathematical result. The nature of our theorem - involving lengthy, technical
proofs and complicated algebraic structures - makes it particularly interesting
for formal verification. Our goal is to promote the use of computer theorem
provers as research tools, and, accordingly, a new way of publishing
mathematical results: a parallel description of a theorem and its formalization
should allow the verification of correct transcription of definitions and
statements into the proof assistant, and straightforward but technical proofs
should be well-hidden in a digital library. We argue that Coq's rich type
theory, combined with its various features such as implicit arguments, allows a
particularly readable formalization and is hence well-suited for communicating
mathematics.

explicitly photon-conserving advection scheme, where radiative fluxes over the
cell interfaces of a structured or unstructured mesh are calculated with a
second-order reconstruction of the intensity field. The approach employs a
direct discretisation of the radiative transfer equation in Boltzmann form with
adjustable angular resolution that in principle works equally well in the
optically thin and optically thick regimes. In our most general formulation of
the scheme, the local radiation field is decomposed into a linear sum of
directional bins of equal solid-angle, tessellating the unit sphere. Each of
these ""cone-fields"" is transported independently, with constant intensity as a
function of direction within the cone. Photons propagate at the speed of light
(or optionally using a reduced speed of light approximation to allow larger
timesteps), yielding a fully time-dependent solution of the radiative transfer
equation that can naturally cope with an arbitrary number of sources, as well
as with scattering. The method casts sharp shadows, subject to the limitations
induced by the adopted angular resolution. If the number of point sources is
small and scattering is unimportant, our implementation can alternatively treat
each source exactly in angular space, producing shadows whose sharpness is only
limited by the grid resolution. A third hybrid alternative is to treat only a
small number of the locally most luminous point sources explicitly, with the
rest of the radiation intensity followed in a radiative diffusion
approximation. We have implemented the method in the moving-mesh code {\small
AREPO}, where it is coupled to the hydrodynamics in an operator splitting
approach that subcycles the radiative transfer alternatingly with the
hydrodynamical evolution steps.

topological obstructions to approximating these matrices by exactly commuting

phases. We generalize previous two dimensional results to higher dimensions; we
give a general expression for the topological invariants for arbitrary
dimension and several symmetry classes, including chiral symmetry classes, and
we present a detailed $K$-theory treatment of this expression for time reversal
invariant three dimensional systems. We can use these results to show
non-existence of localized Wannier functions for these systems.
  We use this approach to calculate the index for time-reversal invariant
systems with spin-orbit scattering in three dimensions, on sizes up to $12^3$,
averaging over a large number of samples. The results show an interesting
separation between the localization transition and the point at which the
average index (which can be viewed as an ""order parameter"" for the topological
insulator) begins to fluctuate from sample too sample, implying the existence
of an unsuspected quantum phase transition separating two different delocalized
phases in this system. One of the particular advantages of the $C^*$-algebraic
technique that we present is that it is significantly faster in practice than
other methods of computing the index, allowing the study of larger systems. In
this paper, we present a detailed discussion of numerical implementation of our
method.

particular, we exhibit a situation where the tail of the resolution of

large period. Can one use socle degrees to predict that the tail of the

give a good description for $\jpsi$ and $\psip$ production. We also study the
methods to fit the long-distance matrix elements using either two linear
combined matrix elements or three matrix elements, and find these two methods
can give consistent results. Compared with the measurements at the LHC and RHIC
for prompt $\jpsi$ and $\psip$ production, our predictions are found to agree
with all data. In particular, the recently released large $p_T$ data (up to
60-70 GeV) at the LHC are in good agreement with our predictions. Our results
imply that the universality of color-octet matrix elements holds approximately
in charmonium hadroproduction, when one uses fixed order perturbative

derive the zirconium abundance in the solar photosphere with the same CO5BOLD
hydrodynamical model of the solar atmosphere that we previously used to
investigate the abundances of C-N-O. We review the zirconium lines available in
the observed solar spectra and select a sample of lines to determine the
zirconium abundance, considering lines of neutral and singly ionised zirconium.
We apply different line profile fitting strategies for a reliable analysis of
Zr lines that are blended by lines of other elements. The abundance obtained
from lines of neutral zirconium is very uncertain because these lines are
commonly blended and weak in the solar spectrum. However, we believe that some
lines of ionised zirconium are reliable abundance indicators. Restricting the
set to Zr II lines, from the CO5BOLD 3D model atmosphere we derive
A(Zr)=2.62+/-0.06, where the quoted error is the RMS line-to-line scatter.

considered based on a sequential stochastic exploration of the input space. A
maximum likelihood estimator of p based on successive dependent Bernoulli data

variance in unconstrained frameworks. Furthermore the bias of the estimator is

with the environment and noise coming from the quantized control. The quantum
noise study of this system is particularly important in fault tolerant quantum
computation where a very high fidelity is demanded. Here, we present a time
evolution study of a two level system (TLS) interacting with a laser pulse and
the electromagnetic vacuum based on the multimode Jaynes-Cummings model. We
develop a diagrammatic formalism in which one can easily identify the coherent
Rabi oscillation of the TLS and its relaxation from corresponding diagrams. In
the small time limit ($t\ll T_1$), where the noise level is small but still an
issue to fault tolerant quantum computing, this method gives a quantitative
evaluation of the quantum noise of the TLS under an optical control with an
arbitrary pulse shape. Furthermore, this approach can be naturally extended
from the Markovian to the non-Markovian regime, resulting in dynamics different
from that obtained in the optical Bloch analysis. All these calculations are
done without any stochastic assumption.

with the lightest supersymmetric particle as the dark matter. Moreover, it
predicts observable SUSY signals in the early runs of the LHC, even perhaps at

doping (x) which is characterized by a spin gap, and sublattice preserving
hopping by a hole, and by a pair of holes, both accompanied by a spin-singlet
backflow. The phase diagram obtained by continuing the spin states from half
filling reproduces the phases of the cuprates. Remarkably, confinement of
metallic conduction to 2d emerges from the theory (i.e., it is not assumed).
Here we show that the Hamiltonian naturally leads to a pairing mechanism in
which the pair has a dual character. Its spin part is a spinon singlet which
(2d) condenses below T*. The charge part is a real-space holon pair formed at
Tp < T*, which undergoes a (3d) Bose-Einstein condensation at Tc < Tp. While
neither is observable separately, the combination is, as a well-defined
excitation of momentum q, and energy w(q). The mechanism is consistent with the
small superfluid density, the decline of Tc at small doping, and the existence
of pairs above Tc in cuprates, as indicated by the observation of diamagnetism

demonstrate that the non-linear system of Maxwell-Bloch equation for the
effective model of the $\Lambda-$type three levels is integrable in the
mathematical sense. Analytic solutions thus obtained describe pulse splitting
accompanied by compression, indicating a kind of non-linear instability of
propagating pulses. The instability is eventually terminated by coherent two
photon emission (called paired superradiance or PSR in short). These results
are displayed by numerical outputs for visual understanding, as well. It is
further shown that the integrable system allows a new class of soliton
solutions. Solitons, implying the phenomenon of seff-induced transparancy at
non-resonant frequencies, are stable against PSR. One of our goals of the
present work is construction of a calculable theoretical framework for PSR
rates associated with a trigger pulse propagation, which is achieved by
combining analytic results with perturbative methods. PSR photon spectrum and
its rate $\propto$(target number density)$^2$, along with their time structure,
are clarified this way. These results may open a new path for interesting
technological applications such as quantum entanglement and for solving the
remaining problems of the still mysterious neutrino. Some basic strategy for
realistic experiments of PSR detection and soliton production is also outlined.

continuum imaging on two submillimeter galaxies (SMGs): GOODS 850-11 and GOODS
850-13. The observations reach sub-mJy rms sensitivities and, interestingly,
resolve both sources into multiple, physically unrelated SMGs. GOODS 850-11 is
resolved into two sources at different redshifts. GOODS 850-13 is resolved into
three sources, two with different spectroscopic redshifts and one only with a
photometric redshift. All the SMA sources have fluxes in the 3-5 mJy range and
all are detected at 1.4 GHz. Three of them are detected by Chandra, and one is
a previously unknown X-ray SMG. This is the first time that single-dish SMGs
are resolved into multiple unrelated sources and also the first time that the
SMA has discovered new SMGs. Our results show that identifications of SMGs at
any wavelengths other than the submillimeter itself can be misleading, since
such identifications usually only pick up one of the real counterparts. Using
simulations that mimic our SCUBA and SMA observations, we find that the number
of triple systems detected in our SMA survey is much higher than that expected
from the current best-determined number counts. We tentatively attribute this
to clustering. We also predict that ALMA will find ~1/3 of >5 mJy 850 um SCUBA
sources to be multiple systems. Based on our SMA observations and simulations,
we suggest that large samples of existing SMGs should be imaged with sensitive
interferometric observations, even if the SMGs were previously thought to be
securely identified.

are investigated using the nonequilibrium Green's function approach. In zigzag
SWCNT ($n$, 0) with $mod(n,3)\not=0$, the thermal conductance is mainly
attributed to the phonon transport, while the electron only has few percentage
contribution. The maximum value of the figure of merit ($ZT$) is about 0.2 in
this type of SWCNT. The $ZT$ is considerably larger in narrower SWCNT because
of enhanced Seebeck coefficient. $ZT$ is smaller in the armchair SWCNT, where
Seebeck coefficient is small due to zero band gap. It is found that the cluster
isotopic doping can reduce the phonon thermal conductance obviously and enhance
the value of $ZT$. The uniaxial elongation and compress strain depresses
phonons in whole frequency region, leading to the reduction of the phonon
thermal conductance in whole temperature range. Interestingly, the elongation
strain can affect the phonon transport more seriously than the compress strain,
because the high frequency $G$ mode is completely filtered out under elongation
strain $\epsilon >0.05$. The strain also has important effect on the subband
edges of the electron band structure by smoothing the steps in the electron
transmission function. The $ZT$ is decreased by strain as the reduction in the
electronic conductance overcomes the reduction in the thermal conductance.

neutrinos with the visible world, that may be of numerical importance at, e.g.,
the ultra high energies (\ge 10^{13} eV)? One major conclusion is that, on the

  Our Cosmos is limited in energy for various particles, electrons or photons

contributed to our understanding of processes that produce X-rays from the
solar system bodies. At Jupiter and Earth, both auroral and non-auroral disk
X-ray emissions have been observed. X-rays have been detected from Saturn's
disk, but no convincing evidence of an X-ray aurora has been observed. The
first soft (0.1- 2 keV) X-ray observation of Earth's aurora by Chandra shows
that it is highly variable. The non-auroral X-ray emissions from Jupiter,
Saturn, and Earth, those from the disk of Mars, Venus, and Moon, and from the

spectral characteristics of X-ray emission from comets, the heliosphere, the
geocorona, and the Martian halo are quite similar, but they appear to be quite
different from those of Jovian auroral X-rays. X-rays from the Galilean

galaxies. However, the bright region of the galaxy luminosity function is
incompatible with the simplest version of hierarchical merging, and it is
believed that feedback from the central black hole in the host galaxies reduces
the number of bright galaxies and regulates the co-evolution of black hole and
host galaxy. Numerous simulations of galaxy evolution have attempted to include
the physical effects of such feedback with a resolution usually exceeding a
kiloparsec. However, interactions between jets and the interstellar medium
involve processes occurring on less than kiloparsec scales. In order to further
the understanding of processes occurring on such scales, we present a suite of
simulations of relativistic jets interacting with a fractal two-phase
interstellar medium with a resolution of two parsecs and a largest scale of one
kiloparsec. The transfer of energy and momentum to the interstellar medium is
considerable, and we find that jets with powers in the range of 10^43-10^46 erg
s^-1 can inhibit star formation through the dispersal of dense gas in the
galaxy core. We determine the effectiveness of this process as a function of
the ratio of the jet power to the Eddington luminosity of the black hole, the
pressure of the interstellar medium and the porosity of the dense gas.

go beyond spectrum sensing and introduce the PU separation problem, which
concerns with the issues of distinguishing and characterizing PUs in the
context of collaborative spectrum sensing and monitor selection. The
observations of monitors are modeled as boolean OR mixtures of underlying
binary sources for PUs. We first justify the use of the binary OR mixture model
as opposed to the traditional linear mixture model through simulation studies.
Then we devise a novel binary inference algorithm for PU separation. Not only

without any prior knowledge regarding PUs' activities, the algorithm achieves

powerful cosmological tools for investigating the large-scale Universe. The big
advantage of the SZ effect is its redshift independence, which is not the case
for visible and X-ray observations. It allows us to directly estimate the
cluster's total mass from the integrated comptonization parameter Y, even for
distant clusters. However, not having a full knowing intra-cluster medium (ICM)
physics can affect the results. By taking self-similar temperature and density
profiles of the ICM into account, we studied how different ICM morphologies can
affect the cluster total mass estimation. With the help of the high percentage
of cool core (CC) clusters, as observed so far, the present analysis focuses on
studying this class of objects. A sample of eight nearby (0.1 < z < 0.5) and
high-mass (M > 10^(14) M_sun) clusters observed by Chandra was considered. We
simulated SZ observations of these clusters through X-ray derived information
and analyzed the mock SZ data again with the simplistic assumption of an
isothermal beta-model profile for the ICM. The bias on the recovered cluster
total mass using different sets of assumptions is estimated to be 50% higher in
the case of hydrostatic equilibrium. Possible contributions to the total bias
due to the line-of-sight integration and the considered ICM template are taken
into account. The large biases on total mass recovery firmly support, if still
necessary, cluster modeling based on more sophisticated universal profiles as
derived by X-ray observations of local objects and hydrodynamical simulations.

associated large deviation rate function $\Phi(c)$ is computed explicitly for
all $0\leq c \leq 1$. It is independent of $\beta$ and displays a quadratic

the distribution of the index has a Gaussian form near the peak, but with a
variance $\Delta(N)$ of index fluctuations growing as $\Delta(N)\sim \log

properties of the dusty AGNs, we derive new black hole (BH) mass estimators
based on velocity widths and luminosities of Near Infrared (NIR) hydrogen
emission lines such as P$\alpha$ and P$\beta$, and also investigate the line
ratios of these Hydrogen lines. To derive the BH mass ($M_{\rm BH}$)
estimators, we used a sample of 37 unobscured Type-1 AGNs with a $M_{\rm BH}$
range of $10^{6.8}$-$10^{9.4} M_{\odot}$, where $M_{\rm BH}$ come from either
reverberation mapping method or single-epoch measurement method using Balmer
lines. Our work shows that $M_{\rm BH}$ can be estimated from the Paschen line
luminosities and the velocity widths to the accuracy of 0.18 - 0.24 dex (rms
scatter). We also show that the mean line ratios of the Paschen lines and the
Balmer lines are $\mathrm{\frac{H\alpha}{P\alpha}} \simeq 9.00$,
$\mathrm{\frac{H\beta}{P\alpha}} \simeq 2.70$, which are consistent with a Case
B recombination under a typical AGN broad line region environment. These ratios
can be used as reference points when estimating the amount of dust extinction
over the broad line region (BLR) for red AGNs. We expect the future application
of the new BH mass estimators on red, dusty AGNs to provide a fresh view of
obscured AGNs.

the universe from first principles of statistical physics and quantum field
theory that is applicable to certain types of beyond the Standard Model physics
(such as the neutrino Minimal Standard Model -- $\nu$MSM) and does not require
the solution of Boltzmann or Kadanoff-Baym equations. The formalism works if a
thermal bath of Standard Model particles is very weakly coupled to a new sector
(sterile neutrinos in the $\nu$MSM case) that is out-of-equilibrium. The key
point that allows a computation without kinetic equations is that the number of
sterile neutrinos produced during the relevant cosmological period remains
small. In such a case, it is possible to expand the formal solution of the von
Neumann equation perturbatively and obtain a master formula for the lepton
asymmetry expressed in terms of non-equilibrium Wightman functions. The master
formula neatly separates CP-violating contributions from finite temperature
correlation functions and satisfies all three Sakharov conditions. These
correlation functions can then be evaluated perturbatively; the validity of the
perturbative expansion depends on the parameters of the model considered. Here
we choose a toy model (containing only two active and two sterile neutrinos) to
illustrate the use of the formalism, but it could be applied to other models.

personal information is stored at a single vendor. This results in potential
privacy problems as users do not have much control over how their private data

replacing the single authority centralization of services by a peer-to-peer
trust-based approach where users can decide with whom they want to share their
private data. In this peer-to-peer collaboration it is very difficult to ensure
that after data is shared with other peers, these peers will not misbehave and
violate data privacy. In this paper we propose a mechanism that addresses the
issue of data privacy violation due to data disclosure to malicious peers. In
our approach trust values between users are adjusted according to their
previous activities on the shared data. Users share their private data by
specifying some obligations the receivers must follow. We log modifications
done by users on the shared data as well as the obligations that must be
followed when data is shared. By a log-auditing mechanism we detect users that
misbehaved and we adjust their associated trust values by using any existing

that the nondimensional parameter, $\beta\propto\lambda_C n_0^{1/3}$ (where
$\lambda_C$ is the reduced Compton wavelength and $n_0$ is the particle number

that {the} higher the values of $n_{0}$, the lower is the growth rate of MI
with cut-offs at lower wave numbers of modulation. Furthermore, the dynamical
evolution of the wave packets is studied numerically. We show that either they
disperse away or they blowup in a finite time, when the wave action is below or
above the threshold. The results could be useful for understanding the

sigma(w) introduced by Ford in Phys. Rev. D38, 528 (1988), defining the
contribution of each frequency to the renormalised energy density of a quantum
field. Firstly, by considering a simple example, we argue that sigma(w) is well
defined, in the sense of being regulator independent, despite an apparently
regulator dependent definition. We then suggest that sigma(w) is a spectral
distribution, rather than a function, which only produces physically meaningful
results when integrated over a sufficiently large range of frequencies and with
a high energy smooth enough regulator. Moreover, sigma(w) is seen to be simply
the difference between the bare spectral density and the spectral density of
the reference background. This interpretation yields a simple `rule of thumb'
to writing down a (formal) expression for sigma(w) as shown in an explicit
example. Finally, by considering an example in which the sign of the Casimir
force varies, we show that the spectrum carries no manifest information about
this sign; it can only be inferred by integrating sigma(w).

The ISM model consists of gas and dust. The gas chemical composition is
regulated by a network of reactions that includes a large number of species
(hydrogen and deuterium based molecules, helium, and metals). New reaction
rates for the charge transfer in $\mathrm H^+$ and $\mathrm H_2$ collisions are
presented. The dust contains the standard mixture of carbonaceous grains
(graphite grains and PAHs) and silicates of which the model follows the
formation and destruction by several processes. The model takes into account an
accurate treatment of the cooling process, based on several physical
mechanisms, and cooling functions recently reported in the literature. The
model is applied to a wide range of the input parameters and the results for
important quantities describing the physical state of the gas and dust are
presented. The results are organized in a database suited to the artificial

measured their line fluxes and derived the O and N abundances using recent
calibrations. The evolution of O and N abundances with redshift clearly shows
the galaxy downsizing effect, where enrichment (and hence star formation)
ceases in high-mass galaxies at earlier times and shifts to lower-mass galaxies
at later epochs. The origin of the scatter in the N/H - O/H diagram has been
examined. The most massive galaxies, where O and N enrichment and star
formation has already stopped, occupy a narrow band in the N/H -- O/H diagram,
defining an upper envelope. The less massive galaxies which are still
undergoing star formation at the current epoch are shifted downwards, towards
lower N/H values in the N/H - O/H diagram. This downward shift is caused by the
time delay between N and O enrichment. This time delay together with the
different star formation histories in galaxies is responsible for the large
scatter in the N/H -- O/H diagram.

anti-correlates with the central cooling time and allows us to characterize the
cool-core strength in low S/N data. We confirm a negative evolution in the
fraction of cool-core clusters with redshift, in particular for very strong

constraining the nature and the evolution of the cool-cores, once large samples

distributed spherical obstacles is studied using molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations. It is observed that dependence of the reduced diffusion
coefficient of these macromolecules on the available volume fraction can be
described reasonably by a power law function. Despite the case of obstructed
diffusion of flexible polymers in which reduced diffusion coefficient has a
weak dependence on the polymer length, this dependence is noticeably strong in
the case of rod-like polymers. Diffusion of these macromolecules in the
presence of obstacles is observed that is anomalous at short time scales and
normal at long times. Duration time of the anomalous diffusion regime is found
that increases very rapidly with increasing both the polymer length and the
obstructed volume fraction. Dynamics of diffusion of these polymers is observed
that crosses over from Rouse to reptation type with increasing the density of
obstacles.

properties of the minimizers in the parameter range $|\log\eps| \ll \Omega
\lesssim \eps^{-2}|\log\eps|^{-1}$ where $ \Omega $ is the rotational velocity
and the coupling parameter is written as $ \eps^{-2} $ with $ \eps \ll 1 $.
Three critical speeds can be identified. At $ \Omega = \Omega_{\mathrm{c_1}}
\sim|\log\eps| $ vortices start to appear and for $ |\log\eps| \ll \Omega <
\Omega_{\mathrm{c_2}} \sim \eps^{-1} $ the vorticity is uniformly distributed
over the disc. For $ \Omega \geq \Omega_{\mathrm{c_2}} $ the centrifugal forces
create a hole around the center with strongly depleted density. For $ \Omega

annulus containing the bulk of the density, but at $ \Omega =
\Omega_{\mathrm{c_3}} \sim \eps^{-2}|\log\eps|^{-1} $ there is a transition to
a giant vortex state where the vorticity disappears from the bulk. The energy
is then well approximated by a trial function that is an eigenfunction of
angular momentum but one of our results is that the true minimizers break
rotational symmetry in the whole parameter range, including the giant vortex
phase.

Sometimes, though, indirect evidence may be temptingly available, perhaps the

difference between direct and indirect statistical evidence marks the boundary
between frequentist and Bayesian thinking. Twentieth-century statistical
practice focused heavily on direct evidence, on the grounds of superior
objectivity. Now, however, new scientific devices such as microarrays routinely
produce enormous data sets involving thousands of related situations, where
indirect evidence seems too important to ignore. Empirical Bayes methodology
offers an attractive direct/indirect compromise. There is already some evidence
of a shift toward a less rigid standard of statistical objectivity that allows
better use of indirect evidence. This article is basically the text of a recent
talk featuring some examples from current practice, with a little bit of
futuristic speculation.

is how much further this bound can be improved. The previous lower bounds do
not exclude the possibility of a polynomial upper bound whose degree does not
depend on $d$. In this paper we resolve this question by constructing a class
of instances with $\Omega ((n \phi)^{(d-\log{d}) \cdot (1-\Theta{1/\phi})})$

the asymptotic limit of infinite time. In this limit, the massless dilaton or
cosmon could be accompanied by another massless scalar field - the geon. At
finite time, small time-dependent masses for both the cosmon and geon are still
present due to imperfect dilatation symmetry. For a sufficiently large mass the
geon will start oscillating and play the role of dark matter, while the cosmon
is responsible for dark energy. The common origin of the mass of both fields
leads to an effective interaction between dark matter and dark energy.
Realistic cosmologies are possible for a simple form of the effective

reduce subgalactic structure formation.

in cool stars; 1) the measurement of polarized light, for example to produce
magnetic maps, and 2) the measurement of integrated Zeeman broadening to
measure the average magnetic field strength on the stellar surface. This

been successfully used in various image restoration applications. The success
of sparse representation owes to the development of l1-norm optimization
techniques, and the fact that natural images are intrinsically sparse in some
domain. The image restoration quality largely depends on whether the employed
sparse domain can represent well the underlying image. Considering that the
contents can vary significantly across different images or different patches in
a single image, we propose to learn various sets of bases from a pre-collected
dataset of example image patches, and then for a given patch to be processed,
one set of bases are adaptively selected to characterize the local sparse
domain. We further introduce two adaptive regularization terms into the sparse
representation framework. First, a set of autoregressive (AR) models are
learned from the dataset of example image patches. The best fitted AR models to
a given patch are adaptively selected to regularize the image local structures.
Second, the image non-local self-similarity is introduced as another
regularization term. In addition, the sparsity regularization parameter is
adaptively estimated for better image restoration performance. Extensive
experiments on image deblurring and super-resolution validate that by using
adaptive sparse domain selection and adaptive regularization, the proposed
method achieves much better results than many state-of-the-art algorithms in

completely by the pair distribution function $ g(r)$, which is, by definition,
strictly a positive function. But when the density decreases, the electronic
correction effect becomes strong from weak, the previous theories basing on
one-particle approximation, such as: RPA, Hubbard and STLS ,\cite{4,9} can't
insure $g(r)$ positive always, which implies that they are becoming invalid and
overestimate the ground state energy. The eigenfunctional theory has a
significant improvement over them, under the linear approximation in solving
the equation of the phase field, the $g(r)$ obtained by the eigenfunctional
theory is always positive and can well satisfy the normalization integral
($n_{0}\int d^3r[g(r)-1]=-1$) which is one of the important features of $g(r)$.

merging style. With an initially over-segmented image, in which the many
regions (or super-pixels) with homogeneous color are detected, image
segmentation is performed by iteratively merging the regions according to a
statistical test. There are two essential issues in a region merging algorithm:
order of merging and the stopping criterion. In the proposed algorithm, these
two issues are solved by a novel predicate, which is defined by the sequential
probability ratio test (SPRT) and the maximum likelihood criterion. Starting
from an over-segmented image, neighboring regions are progressively merged if
there is an evidence for merging according to this predicate. We show that the
merging order follows the principle of dynamic programming. This formulates
image segmentation as an inference problem, where the final segmentation is
established based on the observed image. We also prove that the produced
segmentation satisfies certain global properties. In addition, a faster
algorithm is developed to accelerate the region merging process, which
maintains a nearest neighbor graph in each iteration. Experiments on real
natural images are conducted to demonstrate the performance of the proposed
dynamic region merging algorithm.

falling atoms with respect to an experimental platform at rest on Earth's
surface. Such experiments have been used to test the universality of free fall
by comparing the acceleration of the atoms to that of a classical freely
falling object. In a recent paper, M\""uller, Peters and Chu [Nature {\bf 463},
926-929 (2010)] argued that atom interferometers also provide a very accurate
test of the gravitational redshift when considering the atom as a clock
operating at the Compton frequency associated with the rest mass. We analyze
this claim in the frame of general relativity and of different alternative
theories. We show that the difference of ""Compton phases"" between the two paths
of the interferometer is actually zero in a large class of theories, including
general relativity, all metric theories of gravity, most non-metric theories
and most theoretical frameworks used to interpret the violations of the
equivalence principle. Therefore, in most plausible theoretical frameworks,
there is no redshift effect and atom interferometers only test the universality
of free fall. We also show that frameworks in which atom interferometers would
test the redshift pose serious problems, such as (i) violation of the Schiff
conjecture, (ii) violation of the Feynman path integral formulation of quantum
mechanics and of the principle of least action for matter waves, (iii)
violation of energy conservation, and more generally (iv) violation of the
particle-wave duality in quantum mechanics. Standard quantum mechanics is no
longer valid in such frameworks, so that a consistent interpretation of the
experiment would require an alternative formulation of quantum mechanics. As
such an alternative has not been proposed to date, we conclude that the
interpretation of atom interferometers as testing the gravitational redshift is
unsound.

chromosphere in the first part of this contribution. High-frequency waves are
invoked to build elaborate cool-star chromosphere heating theories but have not
been detected decisively so far, neither as magnetic modes in network elements
nor as acoustic modes in below-the-canopy internetwork regions. Three-minute
upward-propagating acoustic shocks are thoroughly established through numerical
simulation as the cause of intermittent bright internetwork grains, but their
pistoning and their role in the low-chromosphere energy budget remain in
debate. Three-minute wave interaction with magnetic canopies is a newer
interest, presently progressing through numerical simulation. Three-minute
umbral flashes and running penumbral waves seem a similar acoustic-shock
phenomenon awaiting numerical simulation. The low-frequency network Doppler
modulation remains enigmatic. In the second part, I address low-frequency
ultraviolet brightness variations of the internetwork chromosphere in more
detail. They contribute about half of the internetwork brightness modulation
and presumably figure in cool-star basal flux. They appear to be a mixture of
inverse-contrast granular overshoot at small scales and gravity-wave
interference at mesogranular scales. I present TRACE evidence for the latter
interpretation, and speculate that the low-frequency brightness minima map
canopy heights.

for those cases where the two participating atoms are nearly degenerate in
mass. The theoretical framework is the formalism of an oscillation of two atoms
with different total lepton number (and parity), one of which can be in an
excited state so that mass degeneracy is realized. In such a case and assuming
light Majorana neutrinos, the two atoms will be in a mixed configuration with
respect to the weak interaction. A resonant enhancement of transitions between
such pairs of atoms will occur, which could be detected by the subsequent
electromagnetic de-excitation of the excited state of the daughter atom and
nucleus. Available data of atomic masses, as well as nuclear and atomic
excitations are used to select the most likely candidates for such resonant
$0\nu$ECEC transitions. Assuming an effective mass for the Majorana neutrino of
1 eV, some half-lives are predicted to be as low as $10^{22}$ years in the
unitary limit. It is argued that, in order to obtain more accurate predictions
for the $0\nu$ECEC half-lives, precision mass measurements of the atoms
involved are necessary, which can readily be accomplished by today's high
precision Penning traps. Further advancements also require a better
understanding of high-lying excited states of the final nuclei (i.e. excitation
energy, angular momentum and parity) and the calculation of the nuclear matrix
elements.

heart disease has gained increased popularity over the past decade. The use of
computational simulation to examine common clinical problems including single
ventricle physiology and the associated surgical approaches, the effects of
pacemaker implantation on vascular occlusion, or delineation of the
biomechanical effects of implanted medical devices is now routinely appearing
in clinical journals within all pediatric cardiovascular subspecialties. In
practice, such collaboration can only work if both communities understand each
other's methods and their limitations. This paper is intended to facilitate
this communication by presenting in the context of congenital heart disease
(CHD) the main steps involved in performing computational simulation-from the
selection of an appropriate clinical question/problem to understanding the
computational results, and all of the ""black boxes"" in between. We examine the
current state of the art and areas in need of continued development. For
example, medical image-based model-building software has been developed based
on numerous different methods. However, none of them can be used to construct a
model with a simple ""click of a button"". The creation of a faithful,
representative anatomic model, especially in pediatric subjects, often requires
skilled manual intervention. In addition, information from a second imaging
modality is often required to facilitate this process. We describe the
technical aspects of model building, provide a definition of some of the most
commonly used terms and techniques (e.g. meshes, mesh convergence,
Navier-Stokes equations, and boundary conditions), and the assumptions used in
running the simulations. Particular attention is paid to the assignment of
boundary conditions as this point is of critical importance in the current
areas of research within the realm of congenital heart disease. Finally,
examples are provided demonstrating how computer simulations can provide an
opportunity to ""acquire"" data currently unobtainable by other modalities, with
essentially no risk to patients. To illustrate these points, novel simulation
examples of virtual Fontan conversion (from preoperative data to predicted
postoperative state) and outcomes of different surgical designs are presented.
The need for validation of the currently employed techniques and predicted
results are required and the methods remain in their infancy. While the daily
application of these technologies to patient-specific clinical scenarios likely
remains years away, the ever increasing interest in this area among both
clinicians and engineers makes its eventual use far more likely than ever
before and, some could argue, only a matter of [computing] time.
