result has no restrictions on the angular or radial momenta or, in particular,
on the width of the pump, signal and idler modes. We demonstrate the strong

We discuss two methods for the numerical evaluation of pfaffians. The first is
tridiagonalization based on Householder transformations. The main advantage of
this method is its numerical stability that makes unnecessary the
implementation of a pivoting strategy. The second method considered is based on
Aitken's block diagonalization formula. It yields to a kind of LU (similar to
Cholesky's factorization) decomposition (under congruence) of arbitrary
skew-symmetric matrices that is well suited both for the numeric and symbolic
evaluations of the pfaffian. Fortran subroutines (FORTRAN 77 and 90)
implementing both methods are given. We also provide simple implementations in
Python and Mathematica for purpose of testing, or for exploratory studies of
methods that make use of pfaffians.

large scale gravitational potential wells should be shrinking, causing a
blueshift in the CMB photons that cross such structures (Integrated Sachs-Wolfe

these objects, CMB photons also experience inverse Compton scattering off the
hot electrons of the intra-cluster medium, and this results in a distortion
with a characteristic spectral signature of the CMB spectrum (the so-called
thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, [tSZ]). Since both the ISW and the tSZ
effects take place in the same potential wells, they must be spatially
correlated. We present how this cross ISW-tSZ signal can be detected in a

multi frequency CMB experiments like {\it Planck}, {\em without} requiring the
use of external large scale structure tracers data. We find that by masking low
redshift clusters, the shot noise level decreases significantly, boosting the
signal to noise ratio of the ISW--tSZ cross correlation. We also find that
galactic and extragalactic dust residuals must be kept at or below the level of
~0.04 muK^2 at l=10, a limit that is a factor of a few below {\it Planck}'s

$R^{12/13}_{3-2}$, and $^{13}$CO($J=3-2$) to $^{13}$CO($J=1-0$),
$R^{13}_{3-2/1-0}$, at 45$\arcsec$ resolution. These ratios were used for
radiative transfer calculations in order to estimate temperature and density of

$T\mathrm{_{kin}}$ = 15 -- 200 K, and molecular hydrogen gas density
$n(\mathrm{H_2})$ = 8$\times 10^2$ -- 7$\times 10^3$ cm$^{-3}$. We confirmed
that the higher density clumps show higher kinetic temperature and that the
lower density clumps lower kinetic temperature at a better accuracy than in the
previous work. The kinetic temperature and density increase generally from a
Type I GMC to a Type III GMC. We interpret that this difference reflects an
evolutionary trend of star formation in molecular clumps. The
$R^{13}_{3-2/1-0}$ and kinetic temperature of the clumps are well correlated
with H$\alpha$ flux, suggesting that the heating of molecular gas

lack of optimization over local measurements. Applied to quantum walks, we find
that MID, while acting as a loose upper bound on QD, still tends to reflect
correctly the trends in the behavior of the latter. However, there are regimes

introduced and its theoretical grounds set up. This quantity, in contrast to
the remaining Jensen divergences, is very sensitive to the fluctuations of the
probability distributions because it is controlled by the (local) Fisher
information, which is a gradient functional of the distribution. So, it is
appropriate and informative when studying the similarity of distributions,
mainly for those having oscillatory character. The new Jensen-Fisher divergence
shares with the Jensen-Shannon divergence the following properties:
non-negativity, additivity when applied to an arbitrary number of probability
densities, symmetry under exchange of these densities, vanishing if and only if
all the densities are equal, and definiteness even when these densities present
non-common zeros. Moreover, the Jensen-Fisher divergence is shown to be
expressed in terms of the relative Fisher information as the Jensen-Shannon
divergence does in terms of the Kullback-Leibler or relative Shannon entropy.
Finally the Jensen-Shannon and Jensen-Fisher divergences are compared for the
following three large, non-trivial and qualitatively different families of

the one-dimensional self-gravitating ""sheet model"", revisiting in particular
the question of the adequacy of the theory of Lynden-Bell (LB) to describe
them. For ""waterbag"" initial conditions characterized by a single phase space
density, the prediction of this theory is, in this model, a function of only
one parameter, which can conveniently be chosen to be the ratio of the energy
to that in the degenerate limit. Studying a class of such initial conditions in
which the shape of the initial waterbag is varied, we find that the LB
predictions are reasonably good always in the low energy region, while at
higher energies (i.e. in the non-degenerate limit) they are generally not even
qualitatively correct, although certain initial conditions can still be found
where they are as good as at low energy. We find notably that, in line with
what has been observed by Levin et al. in some other models, when LB theory
does not work the QSS are always characterized by the presence of a {\it
degenerate} core, which these authors explain as the result of dynamical
resonances. In short LB theory appears to be a good approximation only when
violent relaxation is sufficiently ""gentle"", and otherwise a degenerate
core-halo structure results.

violations that are stronger, fully explicit, and arguably simpler than earlier
work.
  The first game is based on the Hidden Matching problem of quantum
communication complexity, introduced by Bar-Yossef, Jayram, and Kerenidis. This
game can be won with probability 1 by a strategy using a maximally entangled
state with local dimension $n$ (e.g., $\log n$ EPR-pairs), while we show that
the winning probability of any classical strategy differs from ${1}/{2}$ by at
most $O((\log n)/\sqrt{n})$.
  The second game is based on the integrality gap for Unique Games by Khot and
Vishnoi and the quantum rounding procedure of Kempe, Regev, and Toner. Here
$n$-dimensional entanglement allows the game to be won with probability
$1/(\log n)^2$, while the best winning probability without entanglement is
$1/n$. This near-linear ratio is almost optimal, both in terms of the local
dimension of the entangled state, and in terms of the number of possible
outputs of the two players.

observables in Chern-Simons gauge theory on a Seifert three-manifold can be
given an analogous symplectic description. Among other results, this symplectic
description implies that the stationary-phase approximation to the Wilson loop

action describing the vector mesons requires that the bulk scalar field must
correspond to an operator of canonical dimension two. This is not necessary for
the description of the scalar sector where the generation of the mass spectrum
can be directly related to the formation of gluon condensate in QCD. It is also
demonstrated that such an explicit introduction of local dim2 operator into the

condensate in the power expansion of the gauge-invariant vector correlator as
required by QCD.

a system of multiple two-level atoms in a common quantum field. We make only
the dipole approximation for the atoms and assume weak atom-field interactions.
From these assumptions we use a combination of non-secular open- and
closed-system perturbation theory, and we abstain from any additional
approximation schemes. These more accurate solutions are necessary to explore
several regimes: in particular, near-resonance dynamics and low-temperature
behavior. In detuned atomic systems, small variations in the system energy
levels engender timescales which, in general, cannot be safely ignored, as
would be the case in the rotating-wave approximation (RWA). More problematic
are the second-order solutions, which, as has been recently pointed out, cannot
be accurately calculated using any second-order perturbative master equation,
whether RWA, Born-Markov, Redfield, etc.. This latter problem, which applies to
all perturbative open-system master equations, has a profound effect upon
calculation of entanglement at low temperatures. We find that even at zero
temperature all initial states will undergo finite-time disentanglement
(sometimes termed ""sudden death""), in contrast to previous work. We also use
our solution, without invoking RWA, to characterize the necessary conditions
for Dickie subradiance at finite temperature. We find that the subradiant
states fall into two categories at finite temperature: one that is temperature
independent and one that acquires temperature dependence. With the RWA there is
no temperature dependence in any case.

periodically-shocked inner layers of IRC+10216 where dust also forms and
accelerates the wind. Methods: We describe the molecular formation by a
chemical kinetic network involving carbon-and oxygen-based molecules. We then
apply this network to the physical conditions pertaining to the dust-formation
zone which experiences the passage of pulsation- driven shocks between 1 and 5
R\ast. We solve for a system of stiff, coupled, ordinary, and differential
equations. Results: Non-equilibrium chemistry prevails in the dust-formation
zone. H2O forms quickly above the photosphere from the synthesis of hydroxyl OH
induced by the thermal fragmentation of CO in the hot post-shock gas. The
derived abundance with respect to H2 at 5 R\ast is 1.4\times10-7, which
excellently agrees the values derived from Herschel observations. The
non-equilibrium formation process of water will be active whatever the stellar
C/O ratio, and H2O should then be present in the wind acceleration zone of all

can be triggered by small amounts of latent heat release. In our reference
simulation, the buoyant plume lifts vapor above condensation level, forming a
20km-high optically-thick cloud. Ice grains grow to 200 microns radius and fall
near (or in) the lake at mean rates up to 1.5 mm/hr water equivalent (maximum
rates up to 6 mm/hr water equivalent). Because atmospheric temperatures outside
the surface layer are always well below 273K, supersaturation and condensation
begin at low altitudes above lakes on Mars. In contrast to Earth lake-effect
storms, lake storms on Mars involve continuous precipitation, and their
vertical velocities and plume heights exceed those of tropical thunderstorms on
Earth. Convection does not reach above the planetary boundary layer for lakes
<<10^3 km^2 or for atmospheric pressure >O(10^2) mbar. Instead, vapor is
advected downwind with little cloud formation. Precipitation occurs as snow,
and the daytime radiative forcing at the land surface due to plume vapor and
storm clouds is too small to melt snow directly (<+10 W/m^2). However, if
orbital conditions are favorable, then the snow may be seasonally unstable to
melting and produce runoff to form channels. We calculate the probability of
melting by running thermal models over all possible orbital conditions and
weighting their outcomes by probabilities given by Laskar et al., 2004. We
determine that for an equatorial vapor source, sunlight 15% fainter than at
present, and snowpack with albedo 0.28 (0.35), melting may occur with 4%(0.1%)
probability. This rises to 56%(12%) if the ancient greenhouse effect was
modestly (6K) greater than today.

distributions with values in Banach spaces, that is, transforms of the form
$M^{\mathbf{f}}_{\phi}(x,y)=(\mathbf{f}\ast\phi_{y})(x)$, where the kernel
$\phi$ is a test function and $\phi_{y}(\cdot)=y^{-n}\phi(\cdot/y)$. If the
zeroth moment of $\phi$ vanishes, it is a wavelet type transform; otherwise, we
say it is a non-wavelet type transform.
  The first aim of this work is to show that the scaling (weak) asymptotic
properties of distributions are \emph{completely} determined by boundary
asymptotics of the regularizing transform plus natural Tauberian hypotheses.
Our second goal is to characterize the spaces of Banach space-valued tempered
distributions in terms of the transform $M^{\mathbf{f}}_{\phi}(x,y)$. We
investigate conditions which ensure that a distribution that a priori takes
values in locally convex space actually takes values in a narrower Banach
space. Special attention is paid to find the \emph{optimal} class of kernels
$\phi$ for which these Tauberian results hold.
  We give various applications of our Tauberian theory in the pointwise and
(micro-)local regularity analysis of Banach space-valued distributions, and
develop a number of techniques which are specially useful when applied to
scalar-valued functions and distributions. Among such applications, we obtain
the full weak-asymptotic series expansion of the family of Riemann-type
distributions $R_{\beta}(x)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}e^{i\pi xn^{2}}/n^{2\beta}$,

processing problem arising in many practical contexts. For example, in
exploration geosciences, noisy drill hole records need separating into
stratigraphic zones, and in biophysics, jumps between molecular dwell states
need extracting from noisy fluorescence microscopy signals. Many PWC denoising
methods exist, including total variation regularization, mean shift clustering,
stepwise jump placement, running medians, convex clustering shrinkage and
bilateral filtering; conventional linear signal processing methods are
fundamentally unsuited however. This paper shows that most of these methods are
associated with a special case of a generalized functional, minimized to
achieve PWC denoising. The minimizer can be obtained by diverse solver
algorithms, including stepwise jump placement, convex programming, finite
differences, iterated running medians, least angle regression, regularization
path following, and coordinate descent. We introduce novel PWC denoising
methods, which, for example, combine global mean shift clustering with local
total variation smoothing. Head-to-head comparisons between these methods are

satisfactorily described by considering only the lowest-lying (S-wave) hadronic
final states and assuming the kinematic factor describing phase space
suppression is the same as that for free quarks. For example, the rate for
$D_s$ semileptonic decay is known to be $(17.0 \pm 5.3)%$ lower than those for
$D^0$ or $D^+$, and the model accounts for this difference. When applied to
hadrons containing $b$ quarks, this method implies that the $B_s$ semileptonic
decay rate is about 1% higher than that of the nonstrange $B$ mesons. This
small difference thus suggests surprisingly good local quark-hadron duality for
$B$ semileptonic decays, complementing the expectation based on inclusive
quark-hadron duality that these differences in rates should not exceed a few
tenths of a percent. For $\Lambda_b$ semileptonic decay, however, the inclusive
rate is predicted to be about 13% greater than that of the nonstrange $B$
mesons. This value, representing a considerable departure from a calculation
using a heavy quark expansion, is close to the corresponding experimental ratio
$\Gamma(\Lambda_b)/ \bar \Gamma(B) = 1.13 \pm 0.03$ of total decay rates.

spacetime, which can accommodate arbitrary forces. As a test case, we compute
inspirals under a simple drag force, mimicking the presence of gas. We verify
that both methods give the same results for this simple force. We find that
drag generally causes eccentricity to increase throughout the inspiral. This is
a relativistic effect qualitatively opposite to what is seen in
gravitational-radiation-driven inspirals, and similar to what is observed in
hydrodynamic simulations of gaseous binaries. We provide an analytic
explanation by deriving the leading order relativistic correction to the
Newtonian dynamics. If observed, an increasing eccentricity would provide clear
evidence that the inspiral was occurring in a non-vacuum environment. Our two
methods are especially useful for evolving orbits in the adiabatic regime. Both
use the method of osculating orbits, in which each point on the orbit is
characterized by the parameters of the geodesic with the same instantaneous
position and velocity. Both methods describe the orbit in terms of the geodesic
energy, axial angular momentum, Carter constant, azimuthal phase, and two
angular variables that increase monotonically and are relativistic
generalizations of the eccentric anomaly. The two methods differ in their
treatment of the orbital phases and the representation of the force. In one
method the geodesic phase and phase constant are evolved together as a single
orbital phase parameter, and the force is expressed in terms of its components
on the Kinnersley orthonormal tetrad. In the second method, the phase constants
of the geodesic motion are evolved separately and the force is expressed in
terms of its Boyer-Lindquist components. This second approach is a
generalization of earlier work by Pound and Poisson for planar forces in a
Schwarzschild background.

intensity image sequences. These disturbances have historically been
interpreted as being the signature of slow-mode magnetoacoustic waves
propagating into the corona. The detailed analysis of Hinode EUV Imaging
Spectrometer (EIS) timeseries observations of an active region (known to
contain propagating disturbances) shows strongly correlated, quasi-periodic,
oscillations in intensity, Doppler shift, and line width. No frequency doubling
is visible in the latter. The enhancements in the moments of the line profile
are generally accompanied by a faint, quasi-periodically occurring, excess
emission at ~100 km/s in the blue wing of coronal emission lines. The
correspondence of quasi-periodic excess wing emission and the moments of the
line profile indicates that repetitive high-velocity upflows are responsible
for the oscillatory behavior observed. Furthermore, we show that the same
quasi-periodic upflows can be directly identified in a simultaneous image
sequence obtained by the Hinode X-Ray Telescope (XRT). These results are
consistent with the recent assertion of De Pontieu & McIntosh (2010) that the
wave interpretation of the data is not unique. Indeed, given that several
instances are seen to propagate along the direction of the EIS slit that
clearly show in-phase, quasi-periodic variations of intensity, velocity, width
(without frequency doubling), and blue wing enhanced emission this dataset
would appear to provide a compelling example that upflows are more likely to be
the main cause of the quasi-periodicities observed here, as such
correspondences are hard to reconcile in the wave paradigm.

right-handed vs. left-handed circular polarization of the incident wave, so the

of the physical properties of collisionless plasmas, mostly because of the
large number of astrophysical environments, e.g. the intracluster medium (ICM),
containing magnetic fields which are strong enough to be coupled with the
ionized gas and characterized by densities sufficiently low to prevent the
pressure isotropization with respect to the magnetic line direction. Under
these conditions a new class of kinetic instabilities arises, such as firehose
and mirror ones, which were extensively studied in the literature. Their role
in the turbulence evolution and cascade process in the presence of pressure
anisotropy, however, is still unclear. In this work we present the first
statistical analysis of turbulence in collisionless plasmas using three
dimensional double isothermal magnetohydrodynamical with the
Chew-Goldberger-Low closure (CGL-MHD) numerical simulations. We study models
with different initial conditions to account for the firehose and mirror
instabilities and to obtain different turbulent regimes. We study the
probability distribution functions, spectra, structure functions and anisotropy
of density and velocity fluctuations. The results indicate that in some cases
the instabilities significantly modifies the statistical properties of
turbulence and even though preliminary and restricted to very specific
conditions, show that the physical properties of turbulence in collisionless
plasmas, as those found in the ICM, may be very different from what has been
largely believed. Implications can range from interchange of energies to cosmic
rays acceleration.

method for detecting extrasolar planets. Analysing RV data to determine the
parameters of the extrasolar planets is a significant statistical challenge
owing to the presence of multiple planets and various degeneracies between
orbital parameters. Determining the number of planets favoured by the observed
data is an even more difficult task. Bayesian model selection provides a
mathematically rigorous solution to this problem by calculating marginal
posterior probabilities of models with different number of planets, but the use
of this method in extrasolar planetary searches has been hampered by the
computational cost of the evaluating Bayesian evidence. Nonetheless, Bayesian
model selection has the potential to improve the interpretation of existing
observational data and possibly detect yet undiscovered planets. We present a
new and efficient Bayesian method for determining the number of extrasolar
planets, as well as for inferring their orbital parameters, without having to
calculate directly the Bayesian evidence for models containing a large number
of planets. Instead, we work iteratively and at each iteration obtain a
conservative lower limit on the odds ratio for the inclusion of an additional
planet into the model. We apply this method to simulated data-sets containing
one and two planets and successfully recover the correct number of planets and
reliable constraints on the orbital parameters. We also apply our method to RV
measurements of HD 37124, 47 Ursae Majoris and HD 10180. For HD 37124, we
confirm that the current data strongly favour a three-planet system. We find
strong evidence for the presence of a fourth planet in 47 Ursae Majoris, but
its orbital period is suspiciously close to one year, casting doubt on its
validity. For HD 10180 we find strong evidence for a six-planet system.

strength along the streamer plasma sheet in the outer corona. The method is
based on recent observations of streamer waves, which are regarded as the fast
kink body mode carried by the plasma sheet structure and generated upon the
impact of a fast CME (coronal mass ejection) on a nearby streamer. The mode
propagates outwards with a phase speed consisting of two components. One is the
phase speed of the mode in the plasma rest frame, the other is the speed of the
solar wind streaming along the plasma sheet. The former can be well represented
by the Alfven speed outside the plasma sheet, according to a linear wave
dispersion analysis with a simplified slab model of magnetized plasmas. The
radial profiles of the Alfven speed can be deduced with constraints put on the
speed of the solar wind, which is done by making use of the measurements of
streamer blobs flowing passively in the wind. The radial profiles of the
strength of the coronal magnetic field can be depicted once the electron
density distribution is specified, this is done by inverting the observed
polarized brightness data. Comparing the diagnostic results corresponding to
the first wave trough and the following crest, we find that both the Alfven
speed and magnetic field strength at a fixed distance decline with time. This
is suggestive of the recovering process of the CME-disturbed corona.

very recently; an ordered arrangement was obtained via geometric construction
with {\phi} = 0.7786, which was subsequently compressed numerically to {\phi} =
0.7820. Here we show that tetrahedra pack much better than this, and in a
completely unexpected way. Following a conceptually different approach, using
thermodynamic computer simulations that allow the system to evolve naturally
towards high-density states, we observe that a fluid of hard tetrahedra
undergoes a first-order phase transition to a dodecagonal quasicrystal, which
can be compressed to a packing fraction of {\phi} = 0.8324. By compressing a
crystalline approximant of the quasicrystal, the highest packing fraction we
obtain is {\phi} = 0.8503. If quasicrystal formation is suppressed, the system
remains disordered, jams, and compresses to {\phi} = 0.7858. Jamming and
crystallization are both preceded by an entropy-driven transition from a simple
fluid of independent tetrahedra to a complex fluid characterized by tetrahedra
arranged in densely packed local motifs that form a percolating network at the

and correlated equilibria of strategic games to the quantum setting, in which
we then study the relations between classical and quantum equilibria. Unlike
the previous work that focus on qualitative questions on specific games of
small sizes, we address the following fundamental and quantitative question for
general games:
  How much ""advantage"" can playing quantum strategies provide, if any?
  Two measures of the advantage are studied, summarized as follows.
  1. A natural measure is the increase of payoff. We consider natural mappings
between classical and quantum states, and study how well those mappings
preserve the equilibrium properties. Among other results, we exhibit correlated
equilibrium $p$ whose quantum superposition counterpart $\sum_s
\sqrt{p(s)}\ket{s}$ is far from being a quantum correlated equilibrium;
actually a player can increase her payoff from almost 0 to almost 1 in a
[0,1]-normalized game. We achieve this by a tensor product construction on
carefully designed base cases.
  2. For studying the hardness of generating correlated equilibria, we propose
to examine \emph{correlation complexity}, a new complexity measure for
correlation generation. We show that there are $n$-bit correlated equilibria
which can be generated by only one EPR pair followed by local operation
(without communication), but need at least $\log(n)$ classical shared random
bits plus communication. The randomized lower bound can be improved to $n$, the
best possible, assuming (even a much weaker version of) a recent conjecture in
linear algebra. We believe that the correlation complexity, as a
complexity-theoretical counterpart of the celebrated Bell's inequality, has
independent interest in both physics and computational complexity theory and
deserves more explorations.

high-aspect ratio quantum dots, with occasional long-range order and
characteristic spacing as small as 7 nm, have stimulated interest in this
method as a means of sub-lithographic nanofabrication. Despite intensive
research there is little fundamental understanding of the mechanisms governing
the selection of smooth or patterned surfaces, and precisely which physical
effects cause observed transitions between different regimes has remained a
matter of speculation. Here we report the first prediction of the mechanism
governing the transition from corrugated surfaces to flatness, using only
parameter-free molecular dynamics simulations of single-ion impact induced
crater formation as input into a multi-scale analysis, and showing good
agreement with experiment. Our results overturn the paradigm attributing these
phenomena to the removal of target atoms via sputter erosion. Instead, the
mechanism dominating both stability and instability is shown to be the
impact-induced redistribution of target atoms that are not sputtered away, with
erosive effects being essentially irrelevant. The predictions are relevant in
the context of tungsten plasma-facing fusion reactor walls which, despite a
sputter erosion rate that is essentially zero, develop, under some conditions,
a mysterious nanoscale topography leading to surface degradation. Our results
suggest that degradation processes originating in impact-induced target atom
redistribution effects may be important, and hence that an extremely low
sputter erosion rate is an insufficient design criterion for morphologically
stable solid surfaces under energetic particle irradiation.

The bulge formed from the assembly of subgalaxies at z>3, and has higher

The disk formed with a constant star formation over 13 Gyr, and shows a
decreasing trend of [alpha/Fe] and increasing trends of [(Na,Al,Cu,Mn)/Fe]
against [Fe/H]. However, the thick disk stars tend to have higher [alpha/Fe]

polarized light in the range 0.15-1.5 nm. Polarization control in the soft
X-ray region from linear to circular is highly desirable. Several schemes using
helical undulators have been discussed for the LCLS. One consists in replacing
three of the last planar undulator segments by APPLE III. A second proposal,
the 2nd harmonic helical afterburner, uses short, crossed undulators tuned to
the second harmonic. This last scheme is expected to be the better one. Its
advantages are a high and stable degree of circular polarization and a low
cost. Its disadvantage is a small output power and a narrow wavelength range.
We propose a novel method to generate 10 GW level power at the fundamental
harmonic with 99% degree of circular polarization from the LCLS baseline. Its
merits are low cost, simplicity and easy implementation. After the baseline
undulator, the electron beam is sent through a 40 m long straight section, and
subsequently passes through a short APPLE II radiator. The microbunch structure
is easily preserved, and intense coherent radiation is emitted in the helical
radiator. The background radiation from the baseline undulator is suppressed by
letting radiation and electrons through horizontal and vertical slits upstream
the helical radiator, where the radiation spot size is about ten times larger
than the electron bunch transverse size. Using thin Beryllium foils for the
slits the divergence of the electron beam halo increases by Coulomb scattering,
but the beam will propagate through the setup without electron losses. The
applicability of our method is not restricted to the LCLS baseline setup. LCLS
II or the European XFEL may benefit from this work as well, due to availability
of sufficiently long free space at the end of undulator tunnel.

trees can be extended quite naturally to arbitrary split systems. However, this
extension relies heavily on mathematical peculiarities of the K3ST model, and
providing an analogous augmentation of the general Markov model has thus far
been elusive. In this paper we rectify this shortcoming by showing how to
extend the general Markov model on trees to to include arbitrary splits; and
even further to more general network models. This is achieved by exploring the
algebra of the generators of the continuous-time Markov chain together with the
""splitting"" operator that generates the branching process on phylogenetic
trees. For simplicity we proceed by discussing the two state case and note that
our results are easily extended to more states with little complication.
Intriguingly, upon restriction of the two state general Markov model to the
parameter space of the binary symmetric model, our extension is
indistinguishable from the previous approach only on trees; as soon as any
incompatible splits are introduced the two approaches give rise to differing

simple example, we give a tentative argument that our approach to extending to
more general networks has desirable properties that the previous approaches do

convergent evolution of previously divergent lineages; a property that is of

tests neutral and charged Higgs sectors of new models against the current

of model predictions, such as Higgs masses, branching ratios, effective
couplings and total decay widths. The program then uses the expected and
observed topological cross section limits from the Higgs searches to determine
whether a given parameter scenario of a model is excluded at the 95% C.L. by
those searches. Version 2.0.0 includes 39/53 LEP/Tevatron Higgs search
analyses, compared to 13/36 in the previous release (1.2.0). Among the newly
included analyses are LEP searches for neutral Higgs bosons (H) decaying
invisibly or into hadrons, LEP searches via the production modes (tau+ tau- H)
and (b b-bar H), Tevatron searches via (t t-bar H), and LEP and Tevatron
searches for charged Higgs bosons. Also, all Tevatron results presented at the
ICHEP'10 are included in version 2.0.0. In this talk, we explain the basic
ideas behind the implementation of HiggsBounds and provide a list of search
topologies implemented in version 2.0.0. Furthermore, we apply HiggsBounds
2.0.0 to (a) determine the allowed Higgs mass range for a simple 4th generation

several ways, it is applicable both in the adiabatic and in the non-adiabatic

More specifically, by applying Floquet theory to Cooper pair pumping, we show
that under a cyclic evolution the total charge transferred through the circuit
is proportional to the derivative of the associated Floquet quasi-energy with
respect to the superconducting phase difference. In the presence of an external
environment the expression for the transferred charge acquires a transparent
form in the Floquet representation. It is given by the weighted sum of the
charge transferred in each Floquet state, the weights being the diagonal
components of the stationary density matrix of the system expressed in the

energy distribution and also using a model with multiple temperature
components. The dust temperature for either model shows no trend with redshift.
Splitting the sample into bins of redshift reveals a strong evolution in the
dust properties of the most massive galaxies. At z = 0.4 - 0.5, massive
galaxies had dust masses about five times larger than in the local Universe. At
the same time, the dust-to-stellar mass ratio was about 3-4 times larger, and
the optical depth derived from fitting the UV-sub-mm data with an energy
balance model was also higher. This increase in the dust content of massive
galaxies at high redshift is difficult to explain using standard dust evolution
models and requires a rapid gas consumption timescale together with either a
more top-heavy IMF, efficient mantle growth, less dust destruction or
combinations of all three. This evolution in dust mass is likely to be
associated with a change in overall ISM mass, and points to an enhanced supply
of fuel for star formation at earlier cosmic epochs.

measured and found to be excellent. Special attention has been dedicated to the
study of the detector response as a function of bias HV. The nominal depletion
voltage being 3000V, the detector under investigation shows a peculiar behavior
for biases around 2000V: in a narrow range of about 100V the charge collection
is strongly reduced. The detector seems to be composed by two parts: a small
volume around the HV contact where charges are efficiently collected as at
higher voltage, and a large volume where charges are poorly collected. A
qualitative explanation of this behavior is presented. An event-by-event pulse
shape analysis based on A/E (maximum amplitude of the current pulse over the
total energy released in the detector) has been applied to events in different
energy regions and found very effective in rejecting non localized events. In
conclusion, BEGe detectors are excellent candidates for the second phase of

towed spherical particle is investigated by means of high-resolution direct
numerical simulations. The measurements are carried out using a novel scheme to
integrate the two-way coupling between the particle and the incompressible
surrounding fluid flow maintained in a high-Reynolds-number turbulent regime.
The main idea consists in combining a Fourier pseudo-spectral method for the
fluid with an immersed-boundary technique to impose the no-slip boundary
condition on the surface of the particle. Benchmarking of the code shows a good
agreement with experimental and numerical measurements from other groups. A
study of the turbulent wake downstream the sphere is also reported. The mean
velocity deficit is shown to behave as the inverse of the distance from the
particle, as predicted from classical similarity analysis. This law is
reinterpreted in terms of the principle of ""permanence of large eddies"" that
relates infrared asymptotic self-similarity to the law of decay of energy in
homogeneous turbulence.
  The developed method is then used to attack the problem of an upstream flow
that is in a developed turbulent regime. It is shown that the average drag
force increases as a function of the turbulent intensity and the particle
Reynolds number. This increase is significantly larger than predicted by
standard drag correlations based on laminar upstream flows. It is found that
the relevant parameter is the ratio of the viscous boundary layer thickness to
the dissipation scale of the ambient turbulent flow. The drag enhancement can
be motivated by the modification of the mean velocity and pressure profile
around the sphere by small scale turbulent fluctuations.

2009) of Luminous Blue Variables with the new HERMES echelle spectrograph on
the 1.2 m Mercator telescope at La Palma (Spain). We investigate
high-resolution (R=80,000) optical spectra of two LBVs, P Cyg and HD 168607,
the LBV candidates MWC 930 and HD 168625, and the LBV binary MWC 314. In P Cyg
we observe flux changes in the violet wings of the Balmer H{\alpha}, H{\beta},
and He I lines between May and Sep 2009. The changes around 200 km/s to 300
km/s are caused by variable opacity at the base of the supersonic wind from the
blue supergiant. We observe in MWC 314 broad double-peaked metal emission lines
with invariable radial velocities over time. On the other hand, we measure in
the photospheric S II {\lambda}5647 absorption line, with lower excitation
energy of ~14 eV, an increase of the heliocentric radial velocity centroid from
37 km/s to 70 km/s between 5 and 10 Sep 2009 (and 43 km/s on 6 Apr 2010). The
increase of radial velocity of ~33 km/s in only 5 days can confirm the binary
nature of this LBV close to the Eddington luminosity limit. A comparison with
VLT-UVES and Keck-Hires spectra observed over the past 13 years reveals strong
flux variability in the violet wing of the H{\alpha} emission line of HD
168625, and in the absorption portion of the H{\beta} line of HD 168607. In HD
168625 we observe H{\alpha} wind absorption at velocities exceeding 200 km/s
which develops between Apr and June 2010.

graphene and an amorphous SiO$_2$ substrate. We study the surface
phonon-polaritons contribution to the low-field mobility as a function of
temperature and of carrier density. We find that the electric current saturate
at a high electric field, in agreement with experiment. The saturation current
depends weakly on the temperature, which we attribute to the ""quantum"" friction
between the graphene carriers and the substrate optical phonons. We calculate
the frictional drag between two graphene sheets caused by van der Waals
friction, and find that this drag can induce a high enough voltage which can be
easily measured experimentally. We find that for nonsuspended graphene the
near-field radiative heat transfer, and the heat transfer due to direct
phononic coupling, are of the same order of magnitude at low electric field.
The phononic contribution to the heat transfer dominates at high field. For
large separation between graphene and the substrate the heat transfer is
dominated by the near-field radiative heat transfer.

networks:
  1) We show that relay-networks (i.e. communication networks where different
nodes use the same coding functions) can be used to model dynamic networks.
  2) We introduce {\em the term model}, which is a simple, graph-free symbolic
approach to communication networks.
  3) We state and prove variants of a theorem concerning the dispersion of
information in single-receiver communications.
  4) We show that the solvability of an abstract multi-user communication
problem is equivalent to the solvability of a single-target communication in a
suitable relay network.
  In the paper, we develop a number of technical ramifications of these ideas
and results. One technical result is a max-flow min-cut theorem for the R\'enyi
entropy with order less than one, given that the sources are equiprobably
distributed; conversely, we show that the max-flow min-cut theorem fails for
the R\'enyi entropy with order greater than one. We leave the status of the
theorem with regards to the ordinary Shannon Entropy measure (R\'enyi entropy
of order one and the limit case between validity or failure of the theorem) as
an open question. In non-dynamic static communication networks with a single
receiver, a simple application of Menger's theorem shows that the optimal
throughput can be achieved without proper use of network coding i.e. just by
using ordinary packet-switching. This fails dramatically in relay networks with
a single receiver. We show that even a powerful method like linear network
coding fails miserably for relay networks. With that in mind, it is noticeable
that our rather weak form of network coding (routing with dynamic headers) is
asymptotically sufficient to reach capacity.

requires coding light propagation at high level of precision; this could open a
new detection window of many subtle relativistic effects suffered by light
while it is propagating and entangled in the physical measurements. Light
propagation and its subsequent detection should indeed be conceived in a fully
relativistic context, in order to interpret the results of the observations in
accordance with the geometrical environment affecting light propagation itself,
as an unicum surrounding universe. One of the most intriguing aspects is the
boost towards the development of highly accurate models able to recon- struct
the light path consistently with General Relativity and the precepts of
measurements. This paper deals with the complexity of such a topic by showing
how the geometrical framework of models like RAMOD, initially developed for
astrometric observations, constitutes an appropriate physical environment for
back tracing a light ray conforming to the intrinsic accuracy of space-time.
This article discusses the reasons why RAMOD stands out among the existent
approaches applied to the light propagation problem and provides a proof of its
capability in recasting recent literature cases.

poorly understood role in the star formation history of galaxies. Numerical and
theoretical models cannot yet explain the main properties of merger-induced
starbursts, including their intensity and their spatial extent. Usually, the
mechanism invoked in merger-induced starbursts is a global inflow of gas
towards the central kpc, resulting in a nuclear starburst. We show here, using
high-resolution AMR simulations and comparing to observations of the gas
component in mergers, that the triggering of starbursts also results from
increased ISM turbulence and velocity dispersions in interacting systems. This
forms cold gas that are denser and more massive than in quiescent disk
galaxies. The fraction of dense cold gas largely increases, modifying the
global density distribution of these systems, and efficient star formation
results. Because the starbursting activity is not just from a global compacting
of the gas to higher average surface densities, but also from higher turbulence
and fragmentation into massive and dense clouds, merging systems can enter a
different regime of star formation compared to quiescent disk galaxies. This is
in quantitative agreement with recent observations suggesting that disk
galaxies and starbursting systems are not the low-activity end and
high-activity end of a single regime, but actually follow different scaling
relations for their star formation.

function of polarization and temperature and analyzed theoretically.
Unexpectedly, the intensity in the range up to 300\wn increases upon cooling,
which is counterintuitive when the response originates from vibrations alone as
in insulators. The increase finds a natural explanation if the conduction
electrons are assumed to scatter on localized vibrations with a scattering
probability proportional to the Debye-Waller factor. None of our assumptions is
material specific, and the results are expected to be relevant for disordered
systems in general.

optical observations are sparse, not deliberate follow ups of specific objects,
no orbit determination is possible without previous correlation of observations
obtained at different times. This correlation step is the most computationally
intensive, and becomes more and more difficult as the number of objects to be
discovered increases. In this paper we tested two different algorithms (and the
related prototype software) recently developed to solve the correlation problem
for objects in geostationary orbit (GEO), including the accurate orbit
determination by full least squares solutions with all six orbital elements.
Because of the presence in the GEO region of a significant subpopulation of
high area to mass objects, strongly affected by non-gravitational
perturbations, it was actually necessary to solve also for dynamical parameters
describing these effects, that is to fit between 6 and 8 free parameters for
each orbit. The validation was based upon a set of real data, acquired from the
ESA Space Debris Telescope (ESASDT) at the Teide observatory (Canary Islands).
We proved that it is possible to assemble a set of sparse observations into a
set of objects with orbits, starting from a sparse time distribution of
observations, which would be compatible with a survey capable of covering the
region of interest in the sky just once per night. This could result in a
significant reduction of the requirements for a future telescope network, with
respect to what would have been required with the previously known algorithm
for correlation and orbit determination.

to large granules causing surface inhomogeneities together with shock waves in
the photosphere. The resulting motion of the photocenter (on time scales
ranging from months to years) could possibly have adverse effects on the
parallax determination with Gaia. Aims. We explore the impact of the
granulation on the photocentric and photometric variability. We quantify these
effects in order to better characterize the error possibly altering the
parallax. Methods. We use 3D radiative-hydrodynamics simulations of convection
with CO5BOLD and the post-processing radiative transfer code OPTIM3D to compute
intensity maps and spectra in the Gaia G band [325-1030 nm]. Results. We
provide astrometric and photometric predictions from 3D simulations of RSGs
that are used to evaluate the degradation of the astrometric parameters of
evolved stars derived by Gaia. We show from RHD simulations that a supergiant
like Betelgeuse exhibits a photocentric noise characterised by a standard
deviation of the order of 0.1 AU. The number of bright giant and supergiant
stars whose Gaia parallaxes will be altered by the photocentric noise ranges
from a few tens to several thousandths. The degradation of the astrometric fit
due to the presence of this photocentric noise will be noticeable up to about 5
kpc for the brightest supergiants. Moreover, parallaxes of supergiants are
affected by a error of the order of a few percents. We show that the
photocentric noise, as predicted by the 3D simulation, does account for a
substantial part of the supplementary 'cosmic noise' that affects Hipparcos
measurements of Betelgeuse and Antares.

iron-based compounds with high-temperature superconductivity (HTSC). An
essential open question is whether the two classes of materials share the same
essential physics. In both, superconductivity (SC) emerges when an
antiferromagnetical (AFM) ordered phase is suppressed. However, in cuprates,
the repulsive interaction among the electrons is so strong that the parent
compounds are ""Mott insulators."" By contrast, all iron-based parents are
metallic. One perspective is that the iron-based parents are weakly correlated
and that the AFM arises from a strong ""nesting"" of the Fermi surfaces. An
alternative view is that the electronic correlations in the parents are still
sufficiently strong to place the system close to the boundary between
itinerancy and electronic localization. A key strategy to differentiate theses
views is to explore whether the iron-based system can be tuned into a Mott
insulator. Here we identify an insulating AFM in (Tl,K)FexSe2 by introducing
Fe-vacancies and creating superconductivity in the Fe-planar. With the
increasing Fe-content, the AFM order is reduced. When the magnetism is
eliminated, a superconducting phase with Tc as high as 31K (and a Tc onset as
high as 40K) is induced. Our findings indicate that the correlation effect
plays a crucial role in the iron-based superconductors. (Tl,K)FexSe2,
therefore, represents the first Fe-based high temperature superconductor near
an insulating AFM.
