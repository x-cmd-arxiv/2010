(magnetic) shape memory alloys, ferroelectrics and multiferroics. Giant strain
effects under external fields are obtained in low symmetric modulated
martensitic phases. We outline the origin of modulated phases, their connection
with tetragonal martensite and consequences for their functional properties by
analysing the martensitic microstructure of epitaxial Ni-Mn-Ga films from the
atomic to macroscale. Geometrical constraints at an austenite-martensite phase
boundary act down to the atomic scale. Hence a martensitic microstructure of
nanotwinned tetragonal martensite can form. Coarsening of twin variants can
reduce twin boundary energy, a process we could follow from the atomic to the
millimetre scale. Coarsening is a fractal process, proceeding in discrete steps
by doubling twin periodicity. The collective defect energy results in a
substantial hysteresis, which allows retaining modulated martensite as a
metastable phase at room temperature. In this metastable state elastic energy
is released by the formation of a 'twins within twins' microstructure which can
be observed from the nanometre to millimetre scale. This hierarchical twinning
results in mesoscopic twin boundaries which are diffuse, in contrast to the
common atomically sharp twin boundaries of tetragonal martensite. We suggest
that observed extraordinarily high mobility of such mesoscopic twin boundaries
originates from their diffuse nature which renders pinning by atomistic point
defects ineffective.

use R\'enyi entropy to quantify the entanglement between the fields in the

failure of the replica trick method does not permit to obtain the Von Neumann
entropy. We find that the degree of entanglement is larger in the spontaneously
broken symmetry case and a generalization of geometric entropy area law is

direct comparison of theoretical models with observations. The X-ray spectra of
NGC 6888 are soft and most of the X-rays are in the (0.3 - 1.5 keV) energy
range. But, hard X-rays (1.5 - 4.0 keV) are also detected (~10% of the observed
flux). The corresponding spectral fits require a relatively cool plasma with kT
< 0.5 keV but much hotter plasma with temperature kT > 2.0 keV is needed to
match the observed hard X-ray emission. We find no appreciable temperature
variations within the hot bubble in NGC 6888. The derived abundances (N, O, Ne)
are consistent with those of the optical nebula. This indicates a common origin
of the X-ray emitting gas and the outer cold shell: most of the X-ray plasma
(having non-uniform spatial distribution: clumps) has flown into the hot bubble
from the optical nebula. If the electron thermal conduction is efficient, this
can naturally explain the relatively low plasma temperature of most of the
X-ray emitting plasma. Alternatively, the hot bubble in NGC 6888 will be
adiabatic and the cold clumps are heated up to X-ray temperatures likely by
energy exchange between the heavy particles (hot ions diffusing into the cold
clumps).

double-well potentials with large separation, the power of nonlinearity
determines the subcritical or supercritical character of the bifurcation. The
results are obtained from a careful analysis of the spectral properties of the

spectral properties of linearized Schr\""odinger type operators to show that the
symmetric ground states can either be uniquely continued for the entire
interval of the eigenvalue parameter or they undergo a symmetry--breaking
pitchfork bifurcation due to the second eigenvalue of the linearized operator
crossing zero. In addition we prove the appropriate scaling for the stationary
states in the limit of large values of the eigenvalue parameter. The scaling
and our novel technique imply that all ground states at large eigenvalues must
be localized near a critical point of the potential and bifurcate from the
soliton of the focusing NLS equation without potential localized at the same
point. The theoretical results are illustrated numerically for a double-well
potential obtained after the splitting of a single-well potential. We compare
the cases before and after the splitting, and numerically investigate

Lattice Gauge Theories. Instead of looking at the expectation value of Polyakov
loop correlators we study the modifications induced in the chromoelectric flux
by the presence of the Polyakov loops. In abelian LGTs, thanks to duality, this
study can be performed in a very efficient way, allowing to reach high
precision with a reasonable CPU cost. The major advantage of this numerical
strategy is that it allows to eliminate the dominant effective string
correction to the inter-quark potential (the Luscher term) thus giving an
unique opportunity to test higher order corrections. Performing a set of
simulations in the 3d gauge Ising model we were thus able to precisely identify
and measure both the quartic and the sextic effective string corrections to the
inter-quark potential. While the quartic term perfectly agrees with the
Nambu-Goto one the sextic term is definitely different. Our result seems to
disagree with the recent proof by Aharony and Karzbrun of the universality of
the sextic correction. We discuss a few possible explanations of this
disagreement. The numerical approach described above can also be applied to the
study of Wilson loops. In this case, the numerical results are precise enough
to test the two-loop prediction of the Nambu-Goto action. The two-loop NG
result computed time ago by by Dietz and Filk is incompatible with the data;

spectroscopic binaries DQ Tau and V773 Tau A reveal that their millimeter
spectrum is occasionally dominated by flares from non-thermal emission
processes. The transient activity is believed to be synchrotron in nature,
resulting from powerful magnetic reconnection events when the separate magnetic
structures of the binary components are capable of interacting and forced to
reorganize, typically near periastron. We conducted the first systematic study
of the millimeter variability toward a sample of 12 PMS spectroscopic binaries
with the aim to characterize the proliferation of flares amongst sources likely
to experience similar interbinary reconnection events. The source sample
consists of short-period, close-separation binaries that possess either a high
orbital eccentricity or a circular orbit. Using the MAMBO2 array on the IRAM
30m telescope, we carried out continuous monitoring at 1.25 mm over a 4-night
period during which all of the high-eccentricity binaries approached
periastron. We also obtained simultaneous optical VRI measurements, since a
strong link is often observed between stellar reconnection events and optical
brightenings. UZ Tau E is the only source to be detected at millimeter
wavelengths: it exhibited significant variation; it is also the only source to
undergo strong simultaneous optical variability. The binary possesses the
largest orbital eccentricity in the current sample, a predicted factor in
star-star magnetic interaction events. With orbital parameters and variable
accretion activity similar to DQ Tau, the millimeter behavior of UZ Tau E draws
many parallels to the DQ Tau model for colliding magnetospheres. However, on
the basis of our observations alone, we cannot determine whether the
variability is repetitive, or if it could also be due to variable free-free
emission in an ionized wind.

assumed that annihilation proceeds through a single channel only. In realistic
DM models, annihilation may occur into many different final states, making this
quite a rough ansatz. With additional processes like virtual internal
bremsstrahlung and final state radiation, this ansatz becomes even more
incorrect, and the need for scans of explicit model parameter spaces becomes
clear. Here we present scans of the parameter space of the Constrained Minimal

large annihilation cross-sections. This is true even under reasonable
assumptions about the DM density profiles, and constitutes the strongest
constraint to date on coannihilation models within the CMSSM. The Galactic halo
has a similar, but weaker, effect. The Galactic Centre search is complicated by
a strong (unknown) $\gamma$-ray source, and we see no effect on the CMSSM

weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP)-induced recoils would present a

advantage of these characteristic features and even in the presence of a

directional detectors could lead either to a competitive exclusion or to a
conclusive discovery, depending on the value of the WIMP-nucleon cross section.
However, it is possible to further exploit these upcoming data by using the
strong dependence of the WIMP signal with : the WIMP mass and the local WIMP
velocity distribution. Using a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis of recoil
events, we show for the first time the possibility to constrain the unknown
WIMP parameters, both from particle physics (mass and cross section) and
Galactic halo (velocity dispersion along the three axis), leading to an

the accurate description of the Zn 3d states a correlation treatment based on
wave function methods is needed. Our study rests on a local Hamiltonian
approach which rigorously describes the short-range polarization and charge
redistribution effects around an extra hole or electron placed into the valence
respective conduction bands of semiconductors and insulators. The method also
facilitates the computation of electron correlation effects beyond relaxation
and polarization. The electron correlation treatment is performed on finite
clusters cut off the infinite system. The formalism makes use of localized
Wannier functions and embedding potentials derived explicitly from prior
periodic Hartree-Fock calculations. The on-site and nearest-neighbor charge
relaxation lead to corrections of several eV to the Hartree-Fock band energies
and gap. Corrections due to long-range polarization are of the order of 1.0 eV.
The dispersion of the Hartree-Fock bands is only little affected by electron
correlations. We find the Zn 3d ""semicore"" states to lie about 9.0 eV below the
top of the S 3p valence bands, in very good agreement with values from

distortion of the free surface of such a shear banding fluid is calculated by
balancing the surface tension against the second normal stresses induced in the
two shear bands, and simultaneously requiring a continuous and smooth meniscus.
We show that wormlike micelles typically retain meniscus integrity when shear
banding, but in some cases can lose integrity for a range of average applied
shear rates during which one expects shear banding. This meniscus fracture
would lead to ejection of the sample as the shear banding region is swept
through. We further show that entangled polymer solutions are expected to
display a propensity for fracture, because of their much larger second normal
stresses. These calculations are consistent with available data in the
literature. We also estimate the meniscus distortion of a three band

$H(K)$ on a compact set $K$ in $\mathbb R^n$. One may let $H(K)$ be the unform
closures of all functions in $C(K)$ which are restrictions of harmonic
functions on a neighborhood of $K$, or take $H(K)$ as the subspace of $C(K)$
consisting of functions which are finely harmonic on the fine interior of $K$.
In \cite{DG74} it was shown that these definitions are equivalent. Using a
localization result of \cite{BH78} one sees that a function $h\in H(K)$ if and
only if it is continuous and finely harmonic on on every fine connected
component of the fine interior of $K$. Such collection of sets are usually
called {\it restoring}.
  Another equivalent definition of $H(K)$ was introduced in \cite{P97} using
the notion of Jensen measures which leads another restoring collection of sets.
The main goal of this paper is to reconcile the results in \cite{DG74} and
\cite{P97}.
  To study these spaces, two notions of Green functions have previously been
introduced. One by \cite{P97} as the limit of Green functions on domains $D_j$
where the domains $D_j$ are decreasing to $K$, and alternatively following
\cite{F72, F75} one has the fine Green function on the fine interior of $K$.
Our Theorem \ref{T:green_equiv} shows that these are equivalent notions.
  In Section \ref{S:Jensen} a careful study of the set of Jensen measures on
$K$, leads to an interesting extension result (Corollary \ref{C:extend}) for
superharmonic functions. This has a number of applications. In particular we
show that the two restoring coverings are the same. We are also able to extend
some results of \cite{GL83} and \cite{P97} to higher dimensions.

remarkable symmetry structure. In addition to the superconformal symmetry of
the Lagrangian of the theory, the planar amplitudes exhibit a dual
superconformal symmetry. The presence of this additional symmetry imposes
strong restrictions on the amplitudes and is connected to a duality relating
scattering amplitudes to Wilson loops defined on polygonal light-like contours.
The combination of the superconformal and dual superconformal symmetries gives
rise to a Yangian, an algebraic structure which is known to be related to the
appearance of integrability in other regimes of the theory. We discuss two dual
formulations of the symmetry and address the classification of its invariants.

Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi solution. Generalizing JCAP 1010 (2010) 021, we allow the
size of the voids to be arbitrary and the densities of the voids and walls to
vary in the range 0 < Omega_v < Omega_w < 1. We derive the exact analytic
result for the backreaction and consider its series expansion in powers of the
ratio of the void size to the horizon size, r_0/t_0. In addition, we deduce a
very simple fitting formula for the backreaction with error less than 1% for
voids up to sizes r_0 = t_0. We also construct an exact solution for a network
of voids with different sizes and densities, leading to a non-zero relative
variance of the expansion rate between the voids. While the leading order term
of the backreaction for a single void-wall pair is of order (r_0/t_0)^2, the
relative variance between the different voids in the network is found to be of
order (r_0/t_0)^4 and thus very small for voids of the observed size.
Furthermore, we show that even for very large voids, the backreaction is
suppressed by an order of magnitude relative to the estimate obtained by
treating the walls and voids as disjoint Friedmann solutions. Whether the
suppression of the backreaction due to the shear is just a consequence of the
restrictions of the used exact models, or a generic feature, has to be
addressed with more sophisticated solutions.

of the short-duration GRB 100117A. The faint afterglow is detected 8.3 hr after
the burst with r_AB = 25.46 +/- 0.20 mag. Follow-up optical and near-IR
observations uncover a coincident compact red galaxy, identified as an
early-type galaxy at a photometric redshift of z~0.6-0.9 (2-sigma) with a mass
of 3x10^10 M_Sun, an age of ~1 Gyr, and a luminosity of L_B~0.5L_star.
Spectroscopic observations of the host reveal a notable break corresponding to
the Balmer 4000-Angstrom break at z~0.9, and stellar population spectral
evolution template fits indicate z~0.915, which we adopt as the redshift of the
host, with stellar population ages of ~1-3 Gyr. From a possible weak detection
of [OII]-3727 emission at z=0.915 we infer an upper bound on the star formation
rate of ~0.1 M_Sun per yr, leading to a specific star formation rate of <0.004
per Gyr. Thus, GRB 100117A is only the second short burst to date with a secure
early-type host (the other being GRB 050724 at z=0.257) and it has one of the
highest short GRB redshifts. The offset between the host center and the burst
position, 470 +/- 310 pc, is the smallest to date. Combined with the old
stellar population age, this indicates that the burst likely originated from a
progenitor with no significant kick velocity. However, from the brightness of
the optical afterglow we infer a relatively low density of n~3x10^-4 cm^-3 when
epsilon_e and epsilon_B = 0.1. The combination of an optically faint afterglow
and host suggest that previous such events may have been missed, thereby
potentially biasing the known short GRB host population against z>1 early-type
hosts.

GALEX-discovered star-forming Lyman alpha emitting galaxies (LAEs) at z ~ 0.3.
We measure the emission line fluxes from these galaxies by fitting their
observed spectra to stellar population models in order to correct for
underlying stellar absorption. We revisit earlier stellar population model
fitting results, finding that excluding now-known AGNs lowers the typical
stellar population age and stellar mass of this sample to ~ 300 Myr and ~ 4 x
10^9 Msol, respectively. We calculate their dust extinction using the Balmer
decrement, and find a typical visual attenuation of Av ~ 0.3 mag, similar to
that seen in many high-redshift LAEs. Comparing the ratio of Lyalpha/Halpha and
the Lyman alpha equivalent widths to the measured dust extinction, we find that
the ISMs in these objects appear to be neither enhancing nor seriously
attenuating the Lyman alpha equivalent widths, as would be the case in a
quasi-clumpy ISM. Lastly, we perform a detailed analysis of the gas-phase
metallicities of these galaxies, and we find that most galaxies in our sample
have Z < 0.4 Zsol. We find that at a fixed stellar mass, these low-redshift LAE
analogs are offset by ~ 0.6 dex lower in metallicity from the general galaxy
population at similar redshifts based on the local mass-metallicity
relationship. This implies that galaxies with Lyman alpha in emission may be
systematically more metal poor than star-forming galaxies at the same stellar
mass and redshift, similar to preliminary results at z ~ 2.

AGN over the range of redhifts and luminosities that are relevant in terms of
their contribution to the X-ray background. The ultra-deep exposure, coupled
with the XMM detector's spectral throughput, allowed us to accumulate good
quality X-ray spectra for a large number of X-ray sources and, in particular,
for heavily obscured AGN at cosmological redshifts. Specifically we present the
X-ray spectral properties of two high-redshift - z= 1.53 and z=3.70 - sources.
The XMM spectra of both are very hard, with a strong iron Kalpha line at a
rest-frame energy of 6.4 keV. A reflection-dominated continuum provides the
best description of the X-ray spectrum of the z=1.53 source, while the
intrinsic continuum of the z=3.70 AGN is obscured by a large column N_H ~ 10^24
cm-2 of cold gas. Compton-thick absorption, or close to it, is unambiguously
detected in both sources. Interestingly, these sources would not be selected as

GALEX, and Chandra) and ground-based telescopes. In this paper we use the
high-resolution near-infrared data to recover nuclear structure that is
obscured by dust at optical wavelengths and measure the evolution in this
structure along the merger sequence. A large fraction of all galaxies in our
sample possess double nuclei (~63%) or show evidence for triple nuclei (~6%).
Half of these double nuclei are not visible in the HST B-band images due to
dust obscuration. The majority of interacting LIRGs have remaining merger
timescales of 0.3 to 1.3 Gyrs, based on the projected nuclear separations and
the mass ratio of nuclei. We find that the bulge luminosity surface density
increases significantly along the merger sequence (primarily due to a decrease
of the bulge radius), while the bulge luminosity shows a small increase towards
late merger stages. No significant increase of the bulge Sersic index is found.
LIRGs that show no interaction features have on average a significantly larger
bulge luminosity, suggesting that non merging LIRGs have larger bulge masses
than merging LIRGs. This may be related to the flux limited nature of the
sample and the fact that mergers can significantly boost the IR luminosity of
otherwise low luminosity galaxies. We find that the projected nuclear
separation is significantly smaller for ULIRGs (median value of 1.2 kpc) than
for LIRGs (mean value of 6.7 kpc), suggesting that the LIRG phase appears
earlier in mergers than the ULIRG phase.

and the (d,p) reaction in inverse kinematics. The ground and first excited
states have been determined to be Jpi=5/2+ and Jpi=1/2+ respectively. Two
neutron unbound states were observed at excitation energies of 4.76 +- 0.10 and
6.16 +- 0.11. The spectroscopic factor deduced for the lower of these
interpreted as a 3/2+ level, reveals a rather pure 0d3/2 single-particle
configuration. The large energy difference between the 3/2+ and 1/2+ states is
indicative of the emergence of the N=16 magic number. For the higher lying
resonance, which has a character consistent with a spin-parity assignment of
3/2+ or 7/2-, a 71% branching ratio to the first 2+ state in 20O has been
observed. The results are compared with new shell model calculations.

pnictides. Contrary to the recently suggested universality of this ratio in
Fe-based superconductors, we find that the coupling in pnictides ranges from
weak, near the BCS limit, to strong, as in cuprates, bridging the gap between
these two extremes. Moreover, for Fe- and Cu-based materials, our analysis
reveals a universal correlation between the gap ratio and Tc, which is not
found in conventional superconductors and therefore supports a common
unconventional pairing mechanism in both families. An important consequence of
this result for ferropnictides is that the separation in energy between the
excitonic spin-resonance mode and the particle-hole continuum, which determines
the resonance damping, no longer appears independent of Tc.

game recently introduced by Harada and Tymoczko for the study of the

and Tymoczko also prove that in certain circumstances, a successful outcome of
Betti poset pinball yields a module basis for the equivariant cohomology ring
of the GKM-compatible subspace. Our main contributions are twofold. First we
construct an algorithm (which we call the dimension pair algorithm) which
yields the result of a successful outcome of Betti poset pinball for any type
$A$ regular nilpotent Hessenberg and any type $A$ nilpotent Springer variety,
considered as GKM-compatible subspaces of the flag variety $\Flags(\C^n)$. The
definition of the algorithm is motivated by a correspondence between Hessenberg
affine cells and certain Schubert polynomials which we learned from Erik Insko.
Second, in the special case of the type $A$ regular nilpotent Hessenberg
varieties specified by the Hessenberg function $h(1)=h(2)=3$ and $h(i) = i+1$

Survey. The survey covers ~800 square degrees of the inner galaxy (|b|<4

resolution 5 and 3.5 arcminutes. 505 unique sources are identified in I, of
which 239 are spatially matched between frequency bands, with 50 (216) detected
at 100 (150) GHz alone; 182 sources are identified as ultracompact HII (UCHII)
regions. Approximating the distribution of total intensity source fluxes as a
power-law, we find a slope of $\gamma_{S,100}=-1.8\pm0.4$ at 100 GHz, and
$\gamma_{S,150}=-2.2\pm0.4$ at 150 GHz. Similarly, the power-law index of the
source two-point angular correlation function is
$\gamma_{\theta,100}=-1.21\pm0.04$ and $\gamma_{\theta,150}=-1.25\pm0.04$. The
total intensity spectral index distribution peaks at $\alpha_{I}\sim0.25$,
indicating that dust emission is not the only source of radiation produced by
these objects between 100 and 150 GHz; free-free radiation is likely
significant in the 100 GHz band. Four sources are detected in polarized
intensity P, of which three have matching counterparts in I. Three of the
polarized sources lie close to the galactic center, Sagittarius A*, Sagittarius

however, long-lived CloudNets embeddings are optimized by migrating them to

deal with all link types that arise in practice (e.g., full-duplex or even

interference in multi-antenna wireless networks. The deployment of this
technique requires channel-state information (CSI) feedback from each receiver
to all interferers, resulting in substantial network overhead. To address this
issue, this paper proposes the method of distributive control that
intelligently allocates CSI bits over multiple feedback links and adapts
feedback to channel dynamics. For symmetric channel distributions, it is
optimal for each receiver to equally allocate the average sum-feedback rate for
different feedback links, thereby decoupling their control. Using the criterion
of minimum sum-interference power, the optimal feedback-control policy is shown
using stochastic-optimization theory to exhibit opportunism. Specifically, a
specific feedback link is turned on only when the corresponding transmit-CSI
error is significant or interference-channel gain large, and the optimal number
of feedback bits increases with this gain. For high mobility and considering
the sphere-cap-quantized-CSI model, the optimal feedback-control policy is
shown to perform water-filling in time, where the number of feedback bits
increases logarithmically with the corresponding interference-channel gain.
Furthermore, we consider asymmetric channel distributions with heterogeneous
path losses and high mobility, and prove the existence of a unique optimal
policy for jointly controlling multiple feedback links. Given the
sphere-cap-quantized-CSI model, this policy is shown to perform water-filling
over feedback links. Finally, simulation demonstrates that feedback-control
yields significant throughput gains compared with the conventional
differential-feedback method.

out in 2-dimensions, in which the initial magnetic fields are set to be
composed both of the uniform magnetic fields that model the global fields
penetrating the NS and of the turbulent magnetic fields that would be
originated from the Hall cascade of the large-scale turbulence. Our results
show that the whistler cascade of the turbulence transports the magnetic energy
preferentially in the direction perpendicular to the uniform magnetic fields.
It is also found that the distribution function of electrons becomes
anisotropic because electrons with lower energies are predominantly heated in
the direction parallel to the uniform magnetic fields due to the Landau
resonance, while electrons with higher energies are heated mainly by the
cyclotron resonance that makes the distribution function isotropic for the high
energy tails. Furthermore we point out that the degree of anisotropy takes
maximum as a function of the initial turbulent magnetic energy. As an
alternative to the conventional ohmic dissipation, we propose that the magnetic
fields in the outer crust of NSs, cascading down to the electron inertial scale
via the whistler turbulence, would decay predominantly by the dissipation
processes through the Landau damping and the cyclotron resonance.

sheaf $D_Y$ of crystalline differential operators on $Y$ (also called the sheaf
of $PD$-differential operators) is known to be an Azumaya algebra over
$T^*_{Y'},$ the cotangent space of the Frobenius twist $Y'$ of $Y.$ Thus to a
sheaf of modules $M$ over $D_Y$ one can assign a closed subvariety of
$T^*_{Y'},$ called the $p$-support, namely the support of $M$ seen as a sheaf
on $T^*_{Y'}.$ We study here the family of $p$-supports assigned to the
reductions modulo primes $p$ of a holonomic $\mathcal{D}$-module. We prove that
the Azumaya algebra of differential operators splits on the regular locus of
the $p$-support and that the $p$-support is a Lagrangian subvariety of the
cotangent space, for $p$ large enough. The latter was conjectured by
Kontsevich. Our approach also provides a new proof of the involutivity of the
singular support of a holonomic $\mathcal{D}$-module, by reduction modulo $p.$

quantum physics linked to an optical real image formation apparatus. Optical
real images are formed by photons. Photons are nonlocal quantum objects that
exhibit wave-like properties and particle-like properties. Optical real image
formation is nonlocal because at least two separated object points illuminated
by a single photon are required for real image formation. When the distance
between the illuminated points exceeds twice the wavelength of the light used
two equi-amplitude plane waves propagate independently away from the object
plane toward the imaging system. Propagation of photons away from a single
point in the aperture plane does not occur. Photons with spatial frequencies
that are within the passband of the imaging system pass through the imaging
system. Each plane wave pair that propagates through the imaging system
ultimately arrives at the image plane. At the image plane each plane wave pair
overlaps to form an image of its associated pair of initial points on the
object plane and thus contributes to real image formation. Object and image
field depths are treated and found to be very different than they are
ordinarily thought to be. Resolution limits related to real image formation are
investigated. Reference distribution real image formation (RIF) is introduced.
Real image formation with no fundamental resolution limit is predicted to be
achievable by means of RIF.

behaviors is fractal with long-range correlation. Then the time series are
converted to complex networks by visibility graph algorithm. The topological
properties of the networks, such as scale-free property, small-world effect and
hierarchical structure imply that close relationships exist between the amounts

case of dipolar molecular systems. We identify limiting cases of the
Hamiltonian leading to wavefunctions that can be written in terms of ordinary
exponentials, and focus on the limits of slowly and rapidly varying fields of
arbitrary strength. For rapidly varying fields we prove for arbitrary $N$ that
the population dynamics is independent of the sign of the projection of the
field onto the dipole coupling. In the opposite limit of slowly varying fields
the population of the target level is optimized by a dipole resonance
condition. As a result population transfer is maximized for one sign of the
field and suppressed for the other one, so that a switch based on flopping the
field polarization can be devised. For significant sign dependence the
resonance linewidth with respect to the field strength is small. In the
intermediate regime of moderate field variation, the integral of lowest order
in the coupling can be rewritten as a sum of terms resembling the two limiting
cases, plus correction terms for N>2, so that a less pronounced sign-dependence
still exists.

In particular, we focus on the comparison of the stellar populations between
the central nucleus and the surrounding galactic main body. The stellar
populations of the nuclei are, for most dEs, significantly younger than those
of the respective galactic main bodies, with an average difference of 3.5 Gyr.
We find only five dEs with significantly older nuclei than their galactic main
bodies. Furthermore, we observe most dE nuclei to be more metal rich compared
to their host galaxies. These age and metallicity behaviours are shown by
almost all dEs brighter than M$_{\it r}$ = -17 mag.
  We also examine the presence of radial gradients in the SSP parameters for a
subset of 13 dEs (up to 1.2 kpc or 15 arcsec radius). We notice two different
types of gradients, namely smooth profiles that include the nucleus, and
profiles where a break occurs between the nucleus and the rest of the galaxy.
Nevertheless, an overall trend of increasing age and decreasing metallicity
with radius exists, consistent with earlier studies.

string/brane-theory, we discuss a Finsler-induced Cosmology and its
implications for (thermal) Dark Matter abundances. This constitutes a truly
microscopic model of dynamical space-time, where Finsler geometries arise
naturally. The D-particle foam model involves point-like brane defects
(D-particles), which provide the topologically non-trivial foamy structures of
space-time. The D-particles can capture and emit stringy matter and this leads
to a recoil of D-particles. It is indicated how one effect of such a recoil of
D-particles is a back-reaction on the space-time metric of Finsler type which
is stochastic. We show that such a type of stochastic space-time foam can lead
to acceptable cosmologies at late epochs of the Universe, due to the
non-trivial properties of the supersymmetric (BPS like) D-particle defects,
which are such so as not to affect significantly the Hubble expansion. The
restrictions placed on the free parameters of the Finsler type metric are
obtained from solving the Boltzmann equation in this background for relic
abundances of a Lightest Supersymmetric Particle (LSP) dark matter candidate.
It is demonstrated that the D-foam acts as a source for particle production in
the Boltzmann equation, thereby leading to enhanced thermal LSP relic
abundances relative to those in the Standard LambdaCDM Cosmology. For
D-particle masses of order TeV, such effects may be relevant for dark matter
searches at colliders. The latter constraints complement those coming from high
energy gamma-ray astronomy on the induced vacuum refractive index that D-foam
models entail. We also comment briefly on the production mechanisms of such
TeV-mass stringy defects at colliders, which, in view of the current LHC
experimental searches, will impose further constraints on their couplings.
