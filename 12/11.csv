spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction as a function of both incidence angle and
photon wavelength unambiguously confirm the existence of a skin with an
estimated skin depth of few nanometres, elongated out-of-plane lattice

has revealed that the skin's out of plane lattice parameter changes abruptly at
T*, while the bulk preserves an unfeatured linear thermal expansion. The
distinct properties of the skin are likely to dominate in large surface to

should be particularly relevant for electronic devices that rely on interfacial
couplings such as exchange bias.

the case of the pseudoscalar-meson charge form factors calculated within a
relativistic quantum mechanics framework. It is shown that this role extends
beyond the standard energy-momentum conservation, which is accounted for in all
works based on this general approach. It implies constraints that have been
largely ignored until now but should be nevertheless fulfilled to ensure the
full Poincar\'e covariance. The violation of these constraints, which is more
or less important depending on the form of relativistic quantum mechanics that
is employed, points to the validity of using a single-particle current, which
is generally assumed in calculations of form factors. In short, these
constraints concern the relation of the momentum transferred to the
constituents to the one transferred to the system, which most often differ in
relativistic quantum mechanics while they are equal in field theory. How to
account for the constraints, as well as restoring the equivalence of different
relativistic quantum mechanics approaches in estimating form factors, is
discussed. It is mentioned that the result so obtained can be identified to a
dispersion-relation one. A short conclusion relative to the underlying dynamics
is given in the pion case.

for nonlinear systems, only semiglobal practical stability is generally
achieved. For example, global stabilization of strict-feedforward systems under
sampled measurements, sampled-data stabilization of the nonholonomic unicycle
with arbitrarily sparse sampling, and sampled-data stabilization of LTI systems
over networks with long delays, are open problems. In this paper we present two
general results that address these example problems as special cases. First, we
present global asymptotic stabilizers for forward complete systems under
arbitrarily long input and output delays, with arbitrarily long sampling
periods, and with continuous application of the control input. Second, we
consider systems with sampled measurements and with control applied through a
zero-order hold, under the assumption that the system is stabilizable under
sampled-data feedback for some sampling period, and then construct sampled-data
feedback laws that achieve global asymptotic stabilization under arbitrarily
long input and measurement delays. All the results employ ""nominal"" feedback
laws designed for the continuous-time systems in the absence of delays,
combined with ""predictor-based"" compensation of delays and the effect of

in peer-assisted services when there exist multiple content providers, using a
coalition game theoretic approach. We first consider a generalized coalition
structure consisting of multiple providers with many assisting peers, where
peers assist providers to reduce the operational cost in content distribution.
To distribute the profit from cost reduction to players (i.e., providers and
peers), we then establish a generalized formula for individual payoffs when a
""Shapley-like"" payoff mechanism is adopted. We show that the grand coalition is
unstable, even when the operational cost functions are concave, which is in
sharp contrast to the recently studied case of a single provider where the
grand coalition is stable. We also show that irrespective of stability of the
grand coalition, there always exist coalition structures which are not
convergent to the grand coalition. Our results give us an important insight
that a provider does not tend to cooperate with other providers in
peer-assisted services, and be separated from them. To further study the case
of the separated providers, three examples are presented; (i) underpaid peers,
(ii) service monopoly, and (iii) oscillatory coalition structure. Our study
opens many new questions such as realistic and efficient incentive structures
and the tradeoffs between fairness and individual providers' competition in
peer-assisted services.

outflows that likely exist in all quasars and could play a major role in
feedback to galaxy evolution. The variability of BALs can help us understand
the structure, evolution, and basic physical properties of the outflows. Here
we report on our first results from an ongoing BAL monitoring campaign of a
sample of 24 luminous quasars at redshifts 1.2<z<2.9, focusing on C IV 1549 BAL
variability in two different time intervals: 4 to 9 months (short-term) and 3.8
to 7.7 years (long-term) in the quasar rest-frame. We find that 39% (7/18) of
the quasars varied in the short-term, whereas 65% (15/23) varied in the
long-term, with a larger typical change in strength in the long-term data. The
variability occurs typically in only portions of the BAL troughs. The
components at higher outflow velocities are more likely to vary than those at
lower velocities, and weaker BALs are more likely to vary than stronger BALs.
The fractional change in BAL strength correlates inversely with the strength of
the BAL feature, but does not correlate with the outflow velocity. Both the
short-term and long-term data indicate the same trends. The observed behavior
is most readily understood as a result of the movement of clouds across the
continuum source. If the crossing speeds do not exceed the local Keplerian
velocity, then the observed short-term variations imply that the absorbers are
<6 pc from the central quasar.

hierarchical RH neutrino mass spectrum that results into a final asymmetry

neutrino parameters. Allowing a small misalignment between the Dirac basis and
the charged lepton basis as in the quark sector, the allowed regions enlarge
and the lower bound on the reheating temperature gets relaxed to values as low
as ~ 10^10 GeV. It is confirmed that for normal ordering (NO) there are two
allowed ranges of values for the lightest neutrino mass: m_1 \simeq (1-5)\times
10^-3 eV and m_1\simeq (0.03-0.1) eV. For m_1\lesssim 0.01 eV the allowed

one of the outstanding problems in physics. It is a challenge that has defeated
theoretical physicists for more than twenty years. Attempts to understand this
problem are hindered by the subtle interplay among a few mechanisms and the
presence of several nearly degenerate and competing phases in these systems.
Here we present some crucial experiments that place essential constraints on
the pairing mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity. The observed
unconventional oxygenisotope effects in cuprates have clearly shown strong
electron-phonon interactions and the existence of polarons and/or bipolarons.
Angle-resolved photoemission and tunneling spectra have provided direct
evidence for strong coupling to multiple-phonon modes. In contrast, these
spectra do not show strong coupling features expected for magnetic resonance
modes. Angle-resolved photoemission spectra and the oxygen-isotope effect on
the antiferromagnetic exchange energy J in undoped parent compounds

one order of magnitude larger than J = 0.14 eV. The normal-state
spin-susceptibility data of holedoped cuprates indicate that intersite
bipolarons are the dominant charge carriers in the underdoped region while the

All the experiments to test the gap or order-parameter symmetry consistently
demonstrate that the intrinsic gap (pairing) symmetry for the Fermi-liquid-like

observed recently in experiments, is obtained computationally. A new symmetric
mode, named here as S-III, is also found. At low oscillation amplitudes, the
vortex shedding pattern transitions from antisymmetric to symmetric smoothly
via a regime of intermediate phase. At higher amplitudes, this intermediate
regime is chaotic. The finding of chaos extends and complements the recent work
of Perdikaris et al. [1]. Moreover it shows that the chaos results from a
competition between antisymmetric and symmetric shedding modes. Rectangular
cylinders rather than square are seen to facilitate these observations. A

MIR criteria to determine whether an emission nebula is most likely to be a PN

weakens in regions of stronger magnetic fields, as does the p-mode oscillation

anisotropies has motivated correspondingly precise calculations of the cosmic
recombination history. Cosmic recombination proceeds far out of equilibrium
because of a ""bottleneck"" at the $n=2$ level of hydrogen: atoms can only reach
the ground state via slow processes: two-photon decay or Lyman-$\alpha$
resonance escape. However, even a small primordial abundance of molecules could
have a large effect on the interline opacity in the recombination epoch and
lead to an additional route for hydrogen recombination. Therefore, this paper
computes the abundance of the H$_2$ molecule during the cosmic recombination
epoch. Hydrogen molecules in the ground electronic levels X$^1\Sigma^+_g$ can
either form from the excited H$_2$ electronic levels B$^1\Sigma^+_u$ and
C$^1\Pi_u$ or through the charged particles H$_2^+$, HeH$^+$ and H$^-$. We
follow the transitions among all of these species, resolving the rotational and
vibrational sub-levels. Since the energies of the
X$^1\Sigma^+_g$--B$^1\Sigma^+_u$ (Lyman band) and X$^1\Sigma^+_g$-C$^1\Pi_u$
(Werner band) transitions are near the Lyman-$\alpha$ energy, the distortion of
the CMB spectrum caused by escaped H Lyman-line photons accelerates both the
formation and the destruction of H$_2$ due to this channel relative to the
thermal rates. This causes the populations of H$_2$ molecules in
X$^1\Sigma^+_g$ energy levels to deviate from their thermal equilibrium
abundances. We find that the resulting H$_2$ abundance is $10^{-17}$ at
$z=1200$ and $10^{-13}$ at $z=800$, which is too small to have any significant
influence on the recombination history.

stars has challenged models of planet formation. Recent observations have shown
that a number of these planets have highly inclined, sometimes retrograde
orbits about their parent stars, prompting much speculation as to their origin.
It is known that migration alone cannot account for the observed population of
these misaligned hot Jupiters, which suggests that dynamical processes after
the gas disc dissipates play a substantial role in yielding the observed
inclination and eccentricity distributions. One particularly promising
candidate is planet-planet scattering, which is not very well understood in the
non-linear regime of tides. Through three-dimensional hydrodynamical
simulations of multi-orbit encounters, we show that planets that are scattered
into an orbit about their parent stars with closest approach distance being
less than approximately three times the tidal radius are either destroyed or
completely ejected from the system. We find that as few as 5 and as many as 18
of the currently known hot Jupiters have a maximum initial apastron for
scattering that lies well within the ice line, implying that these planets must
have migrated either before or after the scattering event that brought them to
their current positions. If stellar tides are unimportant $(Q_\ast \gtrsim
10^7)$, disk migration is required to explain the existence of the hot Jupiters
present in these systems. Additionally, we find that the disruption and/or
ejection of Jupiter-mass planets deposits a Sun's worth of angular momentum
onto the host star. For systems in which planet-planet scattering is common, we
predict that planetary hosts have up to a 35% chance of possessing an obliquity
relative to the invariable plane of greater than 90 degrees.

that the MCMC method is superior to previous implementations (based on flux
perturbation) in that it is not affected by biases due to non-physical

degeneracies, and, in particular, a false minimum that occurs at large values

the false minima occurring at large optical depth. We perform a frequentist

surveys, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; at z ~ 0.08) and the Group
Environment and Evolution Collaboration (GEEC; at z ~ 0.4). Using UV imaging
from the GALEX space telescope, along with optical and, for GEEC, near infrared
photometry, we compare the observed spectral energy distributions to large
suites of stellar population synthesis models. This allows us to accurately
determine star formation rates and stellar masses. We find that star forming
galaxies of all environments undergo a systematic lowering of their star
formation rate between z=0.4 and z=0.08 regardless of mass. Nonetheless, the
fraction of passive galaxies is higher in groups than the field at both
redshifts. Moreover, the difference between the group and field grows with time
and is mass-dependent, in the sense the the difference is larger at low masses.
However, the star formation properties of star forming galaxies, as measured by
their average specific star formation rates, are consistent within the errors
in the group and field environment at fixed redshift. The evolution of passive
fraction in groups between z=0.4 and z=0 is consistent with a simple accretion
model, in which galaxies are environmentally affected 3 Gyrs after falling into
a ~ 10E13 Msun group. This long timescale appears to be inconsistent with the
need to transform galaxies quickly enough to ensure that star forming galaxies
appear similar in both the group and field, as observed.

density of at least 15 per square degree to yield the first measurement of the
Baryon Acoustic Oscillations in the Ly-alpha forest. To help reaching this
goal, we have developed a method to identify quasars based on their variability
in the u g r i z optical bands. The method has been applied to the selection of
quasar targets in the SDSS region known as Stripe 82 (the Southern equatorial
stripe), where numerous photometric observations are available over a 10-year
baseline. This area was observed by BOSS during September and October 2010.
Only 8% of the objects selected via variability are not quasars, while 90% of
the previously identified high-redshift quasar population is recovered. The
method allows for a significant increase in the z>2.15 quasar density over
previous strategies based on optical (ugriz) colors, achieving a density of
24.0 deg^{-2} on average down to g~22 over the 220 deg^2 area of Stripe 82. We
applied this method to simulated data from the Palomar Transient Factory and
from Pan-STARRS, and showed that even with data that have sparser time sampling
than what is available in Stripe 82, including variability in future quasar
selection strategies would lead to increased target selection efficiency in the
z>2.15 redshift range. We also found that Broad Absorption Line quasars are
preferentially present in a variability than in a color selection.

inherent presence of a new type of magnetic defects with spin S=1, namely
oxygen vacancies, where the magnetic triplet state is the ground state in the
vicinity of the surface (magnetic shell), while the nonmagnetic singlet is the
ground state in the bulk material (nonmagnetic core). Consideration of randomly
distributed magnetic spins (S=1) had shown that magnetic properties of
incipient ferroelectric nanoparticles are strongly size and temperature
dependent due to the size and temperature dependence of their dielectric
permittivity and the effective Bohr radius proportional to permittivity. The
phase diagrams in coordinates temperature - particle radius are considered. In
particular, for particle radii less that the critical radius ferromagnetic
long-range order appears in a shell region of thickness 5 - 50 nm once the
concentration of magnetic defects exceeds the magnetic percolation threshold.
The critical radius is calculated in the mean field theory from the condition
of the magnetic defects exchange energy equality to thermal energy. For
particle radii higher than critical value only the paramagnetic phase is

detailed study of dc-resistivity ($\rho$), thermoelectric power (S) and thermal
conductivity ($\kappa$). We found that at ambient pressure the magnetic
transition corresponds to a well pronounced peak in dS/dT, as well as to a kink
in the dc-resistivity. The effect of ordering on the thermal conductivity is
rather small but, surprisingly, more pronounced in the lattice contribution
than in the electronic contribution to $\kappa$. Under pressure, the
resistivity increases in the high temperature range, contrary to all previous
measurements in other layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD). In the
low temperature range, the strong dependences of thermopower and resistivity on
pressure are observed below TN, which, in turn, also depends on pressure at
rate of dT$_N$/dp $\approx$ -1 K/kbar. Several possible microscopic

prove the existence of a \textit{universal area-preserving map}, a map with
hyperbolic orbits of all binary periods. The existence of a horseshoe, with
positive Hausdorff dimension, in its domain was demonstrated in \cite{GJ1}. In
this paper the coexistence problem is studied, and a computer-aided proof is
given that no elliptic islands with period less than 20 exist in the domain. It
is also shown that less than 1.5% of the measure of the domain consists of
elliptic islands. This is proven by showing that the measure of initial
conditions that escape to infinity is at least 98.5% of the measure of the
domain, and we conjecture that the escaping set has full measure. This is
highly unexpected, since generically it is believed that for conservative
systems hyperbolicity and ellipticity coexist.

through processes that do not break those symmetries. The proposal made there
to address this shortcoming calls for a dynamical and self-induced quantum

rearrangements required to transform one genome into the other, is often used
as a measure of evolutionary closeness of the genomes in comparative genomics
studies. However, in models that include rearrangements of significantly
different ""power"" such as reversals (that are ""weak"" and most frequent
rearrangements) and transpositions (that are more ""powerful"" but rare), the
genomic distance typically corresponds to a transformation with a large
proportion of transpositions, which is not biologically adequate.
  Weighted genomic distance is a traditional approach to bounding the
proportion of transpositions by assigning them a relative weight {\alpha} > 1.
A number of previous studies addressed the problem of computing weighted
genomic distance with {\alpha} \leq 2.
  Employing the model of multi-break rearrangements on circular genomes, that
captures both reversals (modelled as 2-breaks) and transpositions (modelled as
3-breaks), we prove that for {\alpha} \in (1,2], a minimum-weight
transformation may entirely consist of transpositions, implying that the
corresponding weighted genomic distance does not actually achieve its purpose
of bounding the proportion of transpositions. We further prove that for
{\alpha} \in (1,2), the minimum-weight transformations do not depend on a
particular choice of {\alpha} from this interval. We give a complete
characterization of such transformations and show that they coincide with the
transformations that at the same time have the shortest length and make the
smallest number of breakages in the genomes.
  Our results also provide a theoretical foundation for the empirical
observation that for {\alpha} < 2, transpositions are favored over reversals in
the minimum-weight transformations.

must be made up of \emph{matter} which not only makes up space and the universe
but also is in constant change. For such reason the existence of total
emptiness and material discontinuity are rejected. Here physical fields are
assumed as a particular state of matter. And time is understood as the result
of the intrinsic dynamics of the universe. Furthermore, the infiniteness of the
universe is also discussed and its implications are briefly mentioned, e.g.,
the laws of conservation. Finally, the regularity of the physical laws is
questioned. In summary four great problems (from the perspective of physics)
are suggested to be deeply studied: (1) What is matter?, (2) Why does the
universe change? (3) is the universe infinite in extension? and (4) are there
really regular (invariant) laws of physics?

between optical luminosity and alpha_ox as derived from our sample. Based on
this, we show, as already reported in the literature for quasars with high
optical luminosities, our new sample of BAL QSOs have X-ray luminosity a factor
of three smaller than what has been found for non-BAL QSOs with similar optical
luminosities. Comparison of hardness ratio of the BAL and non-BAL QSOs suggests
a possible soft X-ray weakness of BAL QSOs. Combining our sample, of relatively
fainter QSOs, with others from the literature we show that larger balnicity
index (BI) and maximum velocity (V_max) of the C IV absorption are correlated
with steeper X-ray to optical spectral index. We argue that this is most likely
a consequence of the existence of a lower envelope in the distribution of BI
(or V_max) values versus optical luminosity. Our results thus show that the
previously known X-ray weakness of BAL QSOs extends to lower optical
luminosities as well.

standard Batalin-Vilkovisky approach is that, in reducible theories, the
structure of ghosts and ghosts for ghosts and auxiliary fields is described in
terms of irreducible representations of the Sp(2) group. This makes the
presentation of solutions to the master equations in more simple and systematic
way because they are Sp(2)- scalars.

viewpoint two key features of the cosmological evolution: the inflation in the
early Universe and the late-time accelerated expansion. The key element of this
new model is the Archimedean-type coupling of the dark matter with dark energy,
which form the so-called cosmic dark fluid. We suppose that dark matter
particles immersed into the dark energy reservoir are affected by the force
proportional to the four-gradient of the dark energy pressure. The
Archimedean-type coupling is shown to play a role of effective energy-momentum
redistributor between the dark matter and the dark energy components of the
dark fluid, thus providing the Universe's evolution to be a quasiperiodic
and/or multistage process. In the first part of the work we discuss a
theoretical base and new exact solutions of the model master equations. Special
attention is focused on the exact solutions for which the scale factor is
presented by the anti-Gaussian function: these solutions describe the late-time
acceleration and are characterized by a nonsingular behavior in the early
Universe. The second part contains qualitative and numerical analysis of the
master equations; we focus there on the solutions describing a
multi-inflationary Universe.

P(A_xy)\sim \exp[(cos A_xy)/S], which has the pure XY model and the uniform
distribution of random shifts as extreme cases at S=0 and S->infty

functions when T=S. While the high-temperature phase is always paramagnetic, at
low temperatures there is a ferromagnetic phase for weak disorder (small S) and
a glassy phase at large disorder (large S). These three phases are separated by
transition lines with different magnetic and glassy critical behaviors. The
disorder induced by the random shifts turns out to be irrelevant at the
paramagnetic-ferromagnetic transition line, where the critical behavior belongs
to the 3D XY universality class of pure systems; disorder gives only rise to
very slowly decaying scaling corrections. The glassy critical behavior along
the finite-temperature paramagnetic-glassy transition line belongs to the
gauge-glass universality class, with a quite large critical exponent nu=3.2(4).
These transition lines meet at a multicritical point M, located at

separated by a third transition line, from M down to the T=0 axis, which is

the Archimedean-type interaction the cosmological evolution is shown to have a
multistage character. Depending on the choice of the values of the model
guiding parameters,the Universe's expansion is shown to be perpetually
accelerated, periodic or quasiperiodic with finite number of
deceleration/acceleration epochs. We distinguished the models, which can be
definitely characterized by the inflation in the early Universe, by the
late-time accelerated expansion and nonsingular behavior in intermediate
epochs, and classified them with respect to a number of transition points.
Transition points appear, when the acceleration parameter changes the sign,

Variables in the Via Lactea (VVV) Survey is to accurately measure the physical
parameters of the known globular clusters in the inner regions of the Milky Way
and to search for new ones, hidden in regions of large extinction. Methods:
Deep near infrared images give deep JHKs-band photometry of a region
surrounding the known globular cluster UKS 1 and reveal a new low-mass globular
cluster candidate that we name VVV CL001. Results: We use the horizontal branch
red clump in order to measure E(B-V)~2.2 mag, $(m-M)_0$=16.01 mag, and D=15.9
kpc for the globular cluster UKS 1. Based on the near-infrared colour magnitude
diagrams, we also measure that VVV CL001 has E(B-V)~2.0, and that it is at
least as metal-poor as UKS 1, however, its distance remains uncertain.
Conclusions: Our finding confirms the previous projection that the central
region of the Milky Way harbors more globular clusters. VVV CL001 and UKS 1 are
good candidates for a physical cluster binary, but follow-up observations are
needed to decide if they are located at the same distance and have similar
radial velocities.

the description of means (normalized integrals or invariant means) on an
infinite product of measured spaces with infinite measure. We first remark that
some known examples coming from the theory of metric measured spaces and also
from oscillatory integrals are obtained as limits of means with respect to
finite measures. Then, we explore in a systematic way the limit of means of the
type $$ \lim \frac{1}{\mu(U_n)} \int_{U_n} f d\mu$$ where $\mu$ is a a
$\sigma-$finite Radon measure $\mu.$ In some cases, we get a linear extension
of the limit at infinity. Then, the mean value on an infinite product is
defined, first for cylindrical functions and secondly taking the uniform limit.
Finally, the mean value for the heuristic Lebesgue measure on a separable
infinite dimensional topological vector space (but principally on a Hilbert
space) is defined. This last object is shown to be invariant by translation,
scaling and restriction.

gravitational waveform emitted by nonspinning black-hole binaries of masses
$\mu$ and $M$ in the extreme-mass-ratio limit, $\mu/M=\nu\ll 1$. We focus on
the transition from quasicircular inspiral to plunge, merger and ringdown.We
compare the EOB waveform to a Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli (RWZ) waveform computed
using the hyperboloidal layer method and extracted at null infinity. Because
the EOB waveform keeps track analytically of most phase differences in the
early inspiral, we do not allow for any arbitrary time or phase shift between
the waveforms. The dynamics of the particle, common to both wave-generation
formalisms, is driven by leading-order ${\cal O}(\nu)$ analytically--resummed
radiation reaction. The EOB and the RWZ waveforms have an initial dephasing of
about $5\times 10^{-4}$ rad and maintain then a remarkably accurate phase
coherence during the long inspiral ($\sim 33$ orbits), accumulating only about
$-2\times 10^{-3}$ rad until the last stable orbit, i.e. $\Delta\phi/\phi\sim
-5.95\times 10^{-6}$. We obtain such accuracy without calibrating the
analytically-resummed EOB waveform to numerical data, which indicates the
aptitude of the EOB waveform for LISA-oriented studies. We then improve the
behavior of the EOB waveform around merger by introducing and tuning
next-to-quasi-circular corrections both in the gravitational wave amplitude and
phase. For each multipole we tune only four next-to-quasi-circular parameters
by requiring compatibility between EOB and RWZ waveforms at the light-ring. The
resulting phase difference around merger time is as small as $\pm 0.015$ rad,
with a fractional amplitude agreement of 2.5%. This suggest that
next-to-quasi-circular corrections to the phase can be a useful ingredient in
comparisons between EOB and numerical relativity waveforms.

long tail behavior of queue lengths in broadband networks. Queue length
expression as measured in terms of number of packets involves Hurwitz-zeta
function. When the entropy parameter q in Tsallis entropy is less than unity,
the distribution of packets yields power law behavior. In the limit q tending
to unity, Tsallis entropy expression reduces to one due to Shannon and
well-known results of M/M/1 queuing system are recovered. Relationship between
Tsallis entropy parameter q and Hurst parameter H (measure of self-similarity)
is postulated. A numerical procedure based on Newton-Raphson method is outlined
to compute Lagrange's parameter b. Various relationships between traffic
intensity r and Lagrange's parameter b are examined using data generated from
mean number of packets from storage model due to Norros. It is found that best
fit corresponds to r being a linear combination of decaying exponential and
power exponent in b for different values of entropy parameter q. Explicit
expression for the probability that queue size exceeds a certain value is
derived and it is established that it asymptotically follows power law for q
less than one. The system utilization shows an interesting behavior when the
parameter r is varied. It attains lower values than that of M/M/1 system for
smaller values of r whereas situation reverses for higher values of r.

are expressed in terms of the Jacobi's elliptic functions of three types, cn,
dn, and sn, which give rise to the three different classes of the solutions.
The potentials and associated solutions are parameterized by two free constants

Density maxima of the solutions may coincide with either minima or maxima of

simulations of the GPE. As a result, stability regions are identified for the
periodic solutions and solitons. The periodic patterns of the cn type, and the
respective limit-form solutions in the form of bright solitons, may be stable

engineering activities. However, other scenario notations, such as Message
Sequence Charts (MSC) and UML Sequence Diagrams (SD), have shown to be better
suited for detailed design. In order to use the notation that is best
appropriate for each phase in an efficient manner, a mechanism has to be
devised to automatically transfer the knowledge acquired during the
requirements analysis phase (using UCM) to the design phase (using MSC or SD).
This paper introduces UCMEXPORTER, a new tool that implements such a mechanism
and reduces the gap between high-level requirements and detailed design.
UCMEXPORTER automatically transforms individual UCM scenarios to UML Sequence
Diagrams, MSC scenarios, and even TTCN-3 test skeletons. We highlight the
current capabilities of the tool as well as architectural solutions addressing
the main challenges faced during such transformation, including the handling of
concurrent scenario paths, the generation of customized messages, and tool
interoperability.
