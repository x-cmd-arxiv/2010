impossible at LHC, detection of SUSY matter states is robust, where LHC with
\sqrt{s}=7 TeV and 1fb^{-1} can access m(gluino) 1 TeV for m(squark) m(gluino),
and m(gluino) 640 GeV for m(squark)>> m(gluino). Models with well-tempered
neutralinos will soon be tested by Xenon-100/LUX, and should provide a
distinctive mass edge at LHC in the m(l+l-) distribution. In the case of SUSY,
neutralino dark matter now seems highly disfavored by both the magnitude of the

yields a solution to the strong CP problem, provides all the benefits of SUSY,

supported by the Pickands-Balkema-de Haan Theorem, tail events exceeding some
high threshold are usually modeled by a Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD).
Estimation of GPD tail quantiles is not a trivial task, in particular if one
takes into account the heavy tails of this distribution, the possibility of
singular outliers, and, moreover, the fact that data is usually pooled among
several sources. Moreover, if, as is frequently the case, operational losses
are pooled anonymously, relevance of the fitting data for the respective bank
is not self-evident. In such situations, robust methods may provide stable
estimates when classical methods already fail. In this paper, optimally-robust

analytically calculating the migration rate and time within self-consistently
computed, radiatively heated discs around M stars in which the effects of dust
settling are included. We show that dust settling lowers the disc temperature
and raises the gas density in the mid-plane. This inescapable evolution of disc
structure speeds up type I planetary migration for lower mass bodies by up to a
factor of about 2. We also examine the effects of dust settling on the
gap-opening mass and type II migration, and find that the gap-opening mass is
reduced by a factor of 2 and type II migration becomes slower by a factor of 2.
While dust settling can somewhat alleviate the problem of planetary migration
for more massive planets, the more rapid migration of low mass planets and
planetary cores requires a robust slowing mechanism.

the goal is to find a drawing of $G$ in the plane with minimum number of edge

that has been studied extensively over the past three decades. The first
non-trivial efficient algorithm for the problem, due to Leighton and Rao,
achieved an $O(n\log^4n)$-approximation for bounded degree graphs. This
algorithm has since been improved by poly-logarithmic factors, with the best
current approximation ratio standing on $O(n \poly(d) \log^{3/2}n)$ for graphs
with maximum degree $d$. In contrast, only APX-hardness is known on the
negative side.
  In this paper we present an efficient randomized algorithm to find a drawing
of any $n$-vertex graph $G$ in the plane with $O(OPT^{10}\cdot \poly(d \log

and $d$ is the maximum vertex degree in $G$. This result implies an
$\tilde{O}(n^{9/10} \poly(d))$-approximation for Minimum Crossing Number, thus
breaking the long-standing $\tilde{O}(n)$-approximation barrier for
bounded-degree graphs.

behind in the fundamental, mathematical understanding of network dynamism.
Existing research on time-varying graphs ranges from preliminary algorithmic
studies (e.g., Ferreira's work on evolving graphs) to analysis of specific
properties such as flooding time in dynamic random graphs. A popular model for
studying dynamic graphs is a sequence of graphs arranged by increasing
snapshots of time. In this paper, we study the fundamental property of
reachability in a time-varying graph over time and characterize the latency
with respect to two metrics, namely store-or-advance latency and cut-through
latency. Instead of expected value analysis, we concentrate on characterizing
the exact probability distribution of routing latency along a randomly
intermittent path in two popular dynamic random graph models. Using this
analysis, we characterize the loss of accuracy (in a probabilistic setting)
between multiple temporal graph models, ranging from one that preserves all the
temporal ordering information for the purpose of computing temporal graph
properties to one that collapses various snapshots into one graph (an operation
called smashing), with multiple intermediate variants. We also show how some
other traditional graph theoretic properties can be extended to the temporal
domain. Finally, we propose algorithms for controlling the progress of a packet

two-dimensional honeycomb lattice. We consider a half-filled system in the
vicinity of a symmetry-breaking transition from a semimetallic phase towards an
insulating phase with either charge density or spin density wave order. The
effect of either order is to break the sublattice inversion symmetry which
induces a finite gap for the electronic single-particle excitations.
Phenomenologically, such a scenario is described in the framework of a
Gross-Neveu theory. We analyze two related formulations of the model by means
of (i) a controlled renormalization group calculation and (ii) the large-N
method, both of which in combination with a Boltzmann transport equation. We
determine the quantum-critical conductivity and also discuss crossover behavior
from quantum critical behavior into the insulating and/or the semimetallic
phases. We find that at asymptotically low temperatures the quantum-critical
conductivity is given by a temperature independent universal number. Over a
large temperature window the temperature independent quantum critical
conductivity is masked by a logarithmically temperature dependent contribution
due to the marginally irrelevant long-range Coulomb interaction. We discuss
possible origins of this peculiarity in the two complementary formulations of
the model. Furthermore, we consider possible relations of our findings to
recent experiments, with a special emphasis on the
quantum-critical-to-insulator crossover. We find that our results are in
remarkably good qualitative and quantitative agreement with a recent analysis
of the data sets under the hypothesis of an underlying gap in the

studies of the formation of planetary systems. Resonant systems are of
particular interest because their dynamical configuration provides constraints
on the unobservable formation and migration phase. In this thesis, formation
scenarios for the planetary systems HD128311 and HD45364 are presented. N-body
simulations of two planets and two dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of
proto-planetary discs are used to model the migration phase and the capture
into resonance. The results indicate that the proto-planetary disc has a larger
surface density than previously thought. Proto-planets are exposed to
stochastic forces, generated by density fluctuations in the disc. A generic
model of both a single planet, and two planets in resonance, being
stochastically forced is presented. The system GJ876, for example, is stable
for reasonable strengths of the stochastic forces, but systems with lighter
planets can get disrupted. Even if they are not disrupted completely,
stochastic forces create characteristic, observable libration patterns.
Turbulence plays also an important role during the early phases of the planet
formation process. Due to the large separation of scales, the gravitational
collapse in the core accretion model is very hard to model numerically. A
scaled method is presented, that allows for the correct treatment of
self-gravity in a marginally collisional system by taking into account the
relevant small scale processes. Interestingly, this system is dynamically very
similar to Saturn's rings. The stochastic migration of small bodies in Saturn's
rings is also studied. Analytic predictions of the interactions of a
moonlet/propeller with ring particles are compared to collisional N-body
simulations with up to a million particles. The random walk is fast enough to
be directly observable by the Cassini spacecraft.

the roughness evolves in time following three different behaviors. The
roughness in the initial times behaves as in the random deposition model, with
an exponent $\beta_{1} \approx 1/2$. At intermediate times, the surface
roughness depends on the system dimensionality and, finally, at long times, it
enters into the saturation regime, which is described by the roughness exponent
$\alpha$. The scaling exponents of the model are the same as those predicted by
the Villain-Lai-Das Sarma equation for deposition in one dimension. For the
deposition in two dimensions, we show that the interface width in the second
regime presents an unusual behavior, described by a growing exponent
$\beta_{2}$, which depends on the size of the particles added to the substrate.

Si(Li) solid state detectors and a time of flight system. The low-energy
antideuterons (< 0.3 GeV/n) will be slowed down in the Si(Li) material, replace
a shell electron, and form an excited exotic atom. The atom will be deexcited
by characteristic x-ray transitions and will end its life by forming an
annihilation pion star. This unique event structure will allow for nearly
background free detection. To prove the performance of the different detector
components at stratospheric altitudes, a prototype flight will be conducted in
2011 from Taiki, Japan.

We study how the fidelity of a spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain as a spin bus is
affected by static random exchange couplings and magnetic fields. We find that,
while non-uniform exchange couplings preserve the isotropy of the qubit
effective couplings, they cause the energy levels, the eigenstates, and the
magnitude of the couplings to vary locally. On the other hand, random local
magnetic fields lead to an avoided level crossing for the bus ground state
manifold, and cause the effective qubit couplings to be anisotropic.
Interestingly, the total magnetic moment of the ground state of an odd-size bus
may not be parallel to the average magnetic field. Its alignment depends on
both the direction of the average field and the field distribution, in contrast
with the ground state of a single spin which always aligns with the applied
magnetic field to minimize the Zeeman energy. Lastly, we calculate
sensitivities of the spin bus to such local variations, which are potentially
useful for evaluating decoherence when dynamical fluctuations in the exchange
coupling or magnetic field are considered.

  The article focuses on the problem of paradox as it relates to the broader

examines paradoxes in contemporary physics as they relate to how knowledge is
produced and sees the resolution of the problem of paradox in a better

a slow nucleon in recoil kinematics is studied in the virtual nucleon
approximation, in which the final state interaction (FSI) is calculated within
general eikonal approximation. The cross section is derived in a factorized
approach, with a factor describing the virtual photon interaction with the
off-shell nucleon and a distorted spectral function accounting for the
final-state interactions. One of the main goals of the study is to understand
how much the general features of the diffractive high energy soft rescattering
accounts for the observed features of FSI in deep inelastic scattering(DIS).
  Comparison with the Jefferson Lab data shows good agreement in the covered
range of kinematics. Most importantly, our calculation correctly reproduces the
rise of the FSI in the forward direction of the slow nucleon production angle.
  By fitting our calculation to the data we extracted the $W$ and $Q^2$
dependences of the total cross section and slope factor of the interaction of
DIS products, $X$, off the spectator nucleon. This analysis shows the $XN$
scattering cross section rising with $W$ and decreasing with an increase of
$Q^2$. Finally, our analysis points at a largely suppressed off-shell part of
the rescattering amplitude.

are thought to be capable of supporting zero-energy Majorana bound states. Such
excitations are known to obey non-Abelian statistics in two dimensions, and are
thus relevant to topological quantum computation (TQC). In a one-dimensional
system, Majorana states are localized to phase boundaries. In order to bypass
the constraints of one-dimension, a wire network may be created, allowing the
exchange of Majoranas by way of junctions in the network. Alicea et al. have
proposed such a network as a platform for TQC, showing that the Majorana bound
states obey non-Abelian exchange statistics even in quasi-one-dimensional
systems. Here we show that the particular realization of non- Abelian
statistics produced in a Majorana wire network is highly dependent on the local
properties of individual wire junctions. For a simply connected network, the
possible realizations can be characterized by the chirality of individual
junctions. There is in general no requirement for junction chiralities to
remain consistent across a wire network. We show how the chiralities of
different junctions may be compared experimentally and discuss the implications
for TQC in Majorana wire networks.

imaging surveys of 143 early-type galaxies belonging to the Virgo and Fornax
Clusters using the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) on board HST have not
found a dichotomy in gamma', but instead a systematic progression from central
luminosity deficit to excess relative to the inward extrapolation of the
best-fitting global Sersic model. Given that earlier studies also found that
the dichotomy persisted when analyzing the deprojected density profile slopes,
we investigate the distribution of the three-dimensional luminosity density
profiles of the ACS Virgo and Fornax Cluster Survey galaxies. Having fitted the
surface brightness profiles with modified Sersic models, we then deproject the
galaxies using an Abel integral and measure the inner slopes gamma_3D of the
resulting luminosity density profiles at various fractions of the effective
radius R_e. We find no evidence of a dichotomy, but rather, a continuous
variation in the central luminosity profiles as a function of galaxy magnitude.
We introduce a parameter, Delta_3D, that measures the central deviation of the
deprojected luminosity profiles from the global Sersic fit, showing that this
parameter varies smoothly and systematically along the luminosity function.

launched by a supermassive black hole. The emission site must be far from the
hole and the jet relativistic, in order to avoid absorption of the photons. In
extreme cases, rapid variability of the emission suggests that structures of
length-scale smaller than the gravitational radius of the central black hole
are imprinted on the jet as it is launched, and modulate the radiation released
after it has been accelerated to high Lorentz factor. We propose a mechanism
which can account for the acceleration of the jet, and for the rapid
variability of the radiation, based on the propagation characteristics of
large-amplitude waves in charge-starved, polar jets. Using a two-fluid
(electron-positron) description, we find the outflows exhibit a delayed
acceleration phase, that starts at roughly 1pc, where the inertia associated
with the wave currents becomes important. The time-structure imprinted on the
jet at launch modulates photons produced by the accelerating jet provided the
pair multiplicity in the black-hole magnetosphere is sufficiently small,
suggesting that very rapid variability is confined to sources in which the
electromagnetic cascade in the black-hole magnetosphere is not prolific.

BL Lacs occupy the region populated by Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs).
Studying the properties of their spectral energy distributions (SED) and of
their emitting lines, we find that several of these BL Lacs have a SED similar
to FSRQs and that they do have broad lines of large equivalent width, and
should be reclassified as FSRQs even adopting the current phenomenological
definition (i.e. equivalent width EW of the emitting line greater than 5 A). In
other cases, even if the EW width is small, the emitting lines can be as
luminous as in quasars, and again their SED is similar to the SED of FSRQs.
Sources classified as BL Lacs with a SED appearing as intermediate between BL
Lacs and FSRQs also have relatively weak broad emission lines and small EW, and
can be considered as transition sources. These properties are confirmed also by
model fitting, that allows to derive the relevant intrinsic jet parameters and
the jet power. This study leads us to propose a physical distinction between
the two classes of blazars, based on the luminosity of the broad line region
measured in Eddington units. The dividing line is of the order of L_BLR/L_Edd ~

lines is related to a transition in the accretion regime, becoming radiatively
inefficient below a disk luminosity of the order of one per cent of the

differ from the pure dark matter case. In the outskirts of the halo (~70% of
the virial radius) satellites experience a stronger mass loss and higher
dynamical friction in pure dark matter runs. The situation is reversed in the
central region of the halo, where hydrodynamical satellites have smaller
apocenter distances and suffer higher mass stripping. We partially ascribe this
bimodal behaviour to the delayed infall time for hydro satellites, which on
average cross the virial radius of the parent halo 0.7 Gyrs after their dark

crumpling transition and in the flat phase, using a nonperturbative
renormalization group approach. We avoid a derivative expansion of the
effective average action and instead analyse the full momentum dependence of
the elastic coupling functions. This leads to a more accurate determination of
the critical exponents and further yields the full momentum dependence of the
correlation functions of the in-plane and out-of-plane fluctuation. The flow
equations are solved numerically for D=2 dimensional membranes embedded in a
d=3 dimensional space. Within our approach we find a crumpling transition of
second order which is characterized by an anomalous exponent $\eta_c\approx
0.63(8)$ and the thermal exponent $\nu\approx 0.69$. Near the crumpling
transition the order parameter of the flat phase vanishes with a critical
exponent $\beta\approx 0.22$. The flat phase anomalous dimension is
$\eta_f\approx 0.85$ and the Poisson's ratio inside the flat phase is found to
be $\sigma_f\approx -1/3$. At the crumpling transition we find a much larger
negative value of the Poisson's ratio $\sigma_c \approx -0.71(5)$. We discuss
further in detail the different regimes of the momentum dependent fluctuations,
both in the flat phase and in the vicinity of the crumpling transition, and
extract the crossover momentum scales which separate them.

Concretely, for K field theories which allow for kink or compacton solutions in
1+1 dimensions, i.e., for domain walls in a higher-dimensional context, we find
a simple supersymmetric extension such that the boson field still has the kink
solution, and the field equation for the fermion in the kink background is
linear and is solved by the first spatial derivative of the kink, as is the
case in the corresponding standard supersymmetric theories. This supersymmetric
extension, nevertheless, is peculiar in several aspects. The bosonic part of
the supersymmetric Lagrangian is not equal to the original bosonic K field
Lagrangian, but the bosonic field equations coincide. Further, the field
equation for the bosonic field is produced by the variation of the auxiliary
field and vice versa. This observation may be of some independent interest.
Finally, the presence of kink solutions does not lead to a central extension in
the SUSY algebra, in contrast to the standard case.

solar nebula are used to study the growth of dust mantles swept up by
chondrules. A small neighborhood of the solar nebula is represented by an
orbiting patch of gas at a radius of 3 AU, and includes vertical stratification
of the gas density. The differential rotation of the nebular gas is replaced by
a shear flow. Turbulence is driven by destabilization of the flow as a result
of the magnetorotational instability (MRI), whereby magnetic field lines
anchored to the gas are continuously stretched by the shearing motion. A
passive contaminant mimics small dust grains that are aerodynamically well
coupled to the gas, and chondrules are modeled by Lagrangian particles that
interact with the gas through drag. Whenever a chondrule enters a region
permeated by dust, its radius grows at a rate that depends on the local dust
density and the relative velocity between itself and the dust. The local dust
abundance decreases accordingly. Different chondrule volume densities lead to
varying depletion and rimmed-chondrule size growth times. Most of the dust
sweep-up occurs within 1 gas scale height of the nebula midplane. Chondrules
can reach their asymptotic radius in 10 to 800 years. The vertical variation of
nebula turbulent intensity results in a moderate dependence of mean
rimmed-chondrule size with nebula height. The technique used here could be
combined with Monte Carlo (MC) methods that include the physics of dust
compaction, in a self-consistent MHD-MC model of dust rim growth around
chondrules in the solar nebula.

observer's ability to simultaneously predict the outcome when one of two
measurements is performed on a quantum system. However, if the observer has
access to a particle (stored in a quantum memory) which is entangled with the
system, his uncertainty is generally reduced. This effect has recently been
quantified by Berta et al. [Nature Physics 6, 659 (2010)] in a new, more
general uncertainty relation, formulated in terms of entropies. Using entangled
photon pairs, an optical delay line serving as a quantum memory and fast,
active feed-forward we experimentally probe the validity of this new relation.
The behaviour we find agrees with the predictions of quantum theory and
satisfies the new uncertainty relation. In particular, we find lower
uncertainties about the measurement outcomes than would be possible without the
entangled particle. This shows not only that the reduction in uncertainty
enabled by entanglement can be significant in practice, but also demonstrates
the use of the inequality to witness entanglement.

show that given a tuple-independent representation and the provenance graph of
an SPJ query plan without self-joins, we can, without using the DNF of a result

read-once form can already, if it exists, be computed efficiently using
existing techniques. Our second and key contribution is a complete, efficient,

they exist) directly, using a new concept, that of co-table graph, which can be
significantly smaller than the co-occurrence graph.

  Mathematics, under review",,,,"q-bio.CB math.DS nlin.PS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We describe and analyze a bistable reaction-diffusion (RD) model for two
interconverting chemical species that exhibits a phenomenon of wave-pinning: a
wave of activation of one of the species is initiated at one end of the domain,
moves into the domain, decelerates, and eventually stops inside the domain,
forming a stationary front. The second (""inactive"") species is depleted in this
process. This behavior arises in a model for chemical polarization of a cell by
Rho GTPases in response to stimulation. The initially spatially homogeneous
concentration profile (representative of a resting cell) develops into an
asymmetric stationary front profile (typical of a polarized cell). Wave-pinning
here is based on three properties: (1) mass conservation in a finite domain,
(2) nonlinear reaction kinetics allowing for multiple stable steady states, and
(3) a sufficiently large difference in diffusion of the two species. Using
matched asymptotic analysis, we explain the mathematical basis of wave-pinning,
and predict the speed and pinned position of the wave. An analysis of the
bifurcation of the pinned front solution reveals how the wave-pinning regime
depends on parameters such as rates of diffusion and total mass of the species.
We describe two ways in which the pinned solution can be lost depending on the
details of the reaction kinetics: a saddle-node or a pitchfork bifurcation.

patterns of holes and spins often referred to as stripes. In copper-oxides,
doping also gives rise to the pseudogap state, which transforms into a high
temperature superconductor with sufficient doping or by reducing the
temperature. A long standing question has been the interplay between pseudogap,
which is generic to all hole-doped cuprates, and stripes, whose static form
occurs in only one family of cuprates over a narrow range of the phase diagram.
Here we examine the spatial reorganization of electronic states with the onset
of the pseudogap state at T* in the high-temperature superconductor
Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x using spectroscopic mapping with the scanning tunneling
microscope (STM). We find that the onset of the pseudogap phase coincides with
the appearance of electronic patterns that have the predicted characteristics
of fluctuating stripes. As expected, the stripe patterns are strongest when the
hole concentration in the CuO2 planes is close to 1/8 (per Cu). While
demonstrating that the fluctuating stripes emerge with the onset of the
pseudogap state and occur over a large part of the cuprate phase diagram, our
experiments indicate that they are a consequence of pseudogap behavior rather
than its cause.

manifold, which includes the gradient flows of a number of quadratic geometric
functionals, as for instance the L2 norm of the curvature. Such flows can
develop a special kind of singularities, that could not appear in the Ricci
flow, namely singularities where the manifold collapses with bounded curvature.
We show that this phenomenon cannot occur if we assume a uniform positive lower
bound on the Yamabe invariant. In particular, for a number of gradient flows in
dimension four, such a lower bound exists if we assume a bound on the initial
energy. This implies that these flows can only develop singularities where the
curvature blows up, and that blowing-up sequences converge (up to a
subsequence) to a ""singularity model"", namely a complete Bach-flat, scalar-flat
manifold. We prove a rigidity result for those model manifolds and show that if
the initial energy is smaller than an explicit bound, then no singularity can
occur. Under those assumptions, the flow exists for all time, and converges up
to a subsequence to the sphere or the real projective space. This gives an
alternative proof, under a slightly stronger assumption, of a result from
Chang, Gursky and Yang asserting that integral pinched 4-manifolds with
positive Yamabe constant are space forms.

spectroscopy of a white-light flare, including continuum, Doppler, and magnetic
signatures for the photospheric FeI line at 6173.34{\AA} and its neighboring
continuum. In the impulsive phase of the flare, a bright white-light kernel
appears in each of the two magnetic footpoints. When the flare occurred, the
spectral coverage of the HMI filtergrams (six equidistant samples spanning
\pm172m{\AA} around nominal line center) encompassed the line core and the blue
continuum sufficiently far from the core to eliminate significant Doppler
crosstalk in the latter, which is otherwise a possibility for the extreme
conditions in a white-light flare. RHESSI obtained complete hard X-ray and
\Upsilon-ray spectra (this was the first \Upsilon-ray flare of Cycle 24). The
FeI line appears to be shifted to the blue during the flare but does not go

rank minimization problems are often converted to nuclear norm minimization

suffers from the high computation cost of multiple SVDs. To relieve this issue,
we propose using the block Lanczos method to compute the partial SVDs, where
the principal singular subspaces obtained in the previous iteration are used to
start the block Lanczos procedure. To avoid the expensive reorthogonalization
in the Lanczos procedure, the block Lanczos procedure is performed for only a
few steps. Our block Lanczos with warm start (BLWS) technique can be adopted by
different algorithms that solve NNM problems. We present numerical results on
applying BLWS to Robust PCA and Matrix Completion problems. Experimental
results show that our BLWS technique usually accelerates its host algorithm by
at least two to three times.

us to strictly separate deterministic and non-deterministic Markov transition

another one. The original polar decoding algorithm is also generalized to an
algorithm allowing to learn information about the source distribution using the
idea of checkers. These tools are used to construct a universal compression

constant energy remains in the original eigenmode of the perturbation. For
$\delta > \delta_c$, which we calculate analytically, a single contact breaks
and fluctuations abruptly spread to all harmonic modes. As $\delta$ increases
further all discrete harmonic modes disappear into a continuous frequency band.
We find that $<\delta_c >\sim \Delta \phi/N^{\lambda}$, where $1 > \lambda >
0.5$, and thus jammed particulate systems are inherently nonharmonic with no
linear vibrational response regime as $N\rightarrow \infty$ over the full range

evaluating the ratio of the instantaneous firing rates. In contrast to most
previously proposed measures it is parameter free and time-scale independent.
However, it is not well suited to track changes in synchrony that are based on
spike coincidences. Here we propose the SPIKE-distance, a complementary measure
which is sensitive to spike coincidences but still shares the fundamental
advantages of the ISI-distance. In particular, it is easy to visualize in a

allowing us to refine the system parameters and search for additional planets
via transit timing. Starspot-crossing events are detected in two light curves,
and the star is found to be variable by a few percent. Hence, in our analysis,
special attention is given to systematic errors that result from star spots.
The planet-to-star radius ratio is 0.11610+/-0.00048, subject to a possible
upward bias by a few percent due to the unknown spot coverage. Even assuming
this bias to be negligible, the mean density of planet can be either
3.03+/-0.50 g cm^{-3} or 1.89+/-0.33 g cm^{-3}, depending on whether the
stellar radius is estimated from evolutionary models or from an empirical
mass-luminosity relation combined with the light curve parameters. One possible
resolution is that the orbit is eccentric (e approximately equal to 0.14),
which would favor the higher density, and hence a much thinner atmosphere for
the planet. The transit times were found to be periodic within about 15s,
ruling out the existence of any other super-Earths with periods within a
factor-of-two of the known planet.

eavesdropper, we highlight and analyze some aspects that are missing in the
prior work, which is especially relevant for the quality of secure sensing in
delay-intolerant applications monitoring rare and spatially sparse events, and
deployed as large wireless sensor networks with single data collector. We
propose an efficient scheme for generating fake network traffic to disguise the
real event notification. The efficiency of the scheme that provides statistical
source location anonymity is achieved by partitioning network nodes randomly
into several dummy source groups. Members of the same group collectively
emulate both temporal and spatial distribution of the event. Under such
dummy-traffic framework of the source anonymity protection, we aim to better
model the global eavesdropper, especially her way of using statistical tests to
detect the real event, and to present the quality of the location protection as
relative to the adversary's strength. In addition, our approach aims to reduce
the per-event work spent to generate the fake traffic while, most importantly,
providing a guaranteed latency in reporting the event. The latency is
controlled by decoupling the routing from the fake-traffic schedule. A good
dummy source group design also provides a robust protection of event bursts.
This is achieved at the expense of the significant overhead as the number of
dummy source groups must be increased to the reciprocal value of the false
alarm parameter used in the statistical test. We believe that the proposed

justified by the abundance of the applications that monitor a rare event with

accounts for the reliability-throughput tradeoff by explicitly incorporating
the impact of sensing duration on secondary throughput and primary activity

from data overhead. Numerical simulations of the system performance demonstrate
the effectiveness of adaptive sensing and transmission scheme over non-adaptive

terms of the in-medium values of QCD condensates. The values of these
parameters at saturation density and the dependence on the baryon density and
on the neutron-to-proton density ratio is in agreement with the results,
obtained by conventional nuclear physics method. The contributions to $m^*$ and
$\Sigma_V$ are related to observables and do not require phenomenological
parameters. The scalar interaction is shown to be determined by the
pion--nucleon $\sigma$-term. The nonlinear behavior of the scalar condensate
may appear to provide a possible mechanism of the saturation. The approach
provided reasonable results for renormalization of the axial coupling constant,
for the contribution of the strong interactions to the neutron--proton mass
difference and for the behavior of the structure functions of the in-medium
nucleon. The approach enables to solve the problems which are difficult or

guide-lines for building the nuclear forces. The three-body interactions emerge

period of 93.737 s were clearly detected in the light curves of the pulsar up
to the 80-100 keV energy band. The pulse profile was found to be strongly
energy dependent, a double peaked profile at soft X-ray energy bands (< 8 keV)
and a single peaked smooth profile at hard X-rays. The broad-band energy
spectrum of the pulsar, reported for the first instance in this paper, is well
described with three different continuum models viz. (i) a high energy cut-off
power-law, (ii) a Negative and Positive power-law with EXponential cut-off
(NPEX), and (iii) a partial covering power-law with high energy cut-off.
Inspite of large value of absorption column density in the direction of the
pulsar, a blackbody component of temperature ~0.17 keV for the soft excess was
required for the first two continuum models. A narrow iron K_\alpha emission
line was detected in the pulsar spectrum. The partial covering model, however,
is found to explain the phase averaged and phase resolved spectra well. The dip
like feature in the pulse profile can be explained by the presence of an
additional absorption component with high column density and covering fraction
at the same pulse phase. The details of the results are described in the paper.

transfer function and the point spread function that characterize 2D imaging
through a multilayer both have a matrix form and cross-polarisation coupling is
observed for spatially modulated beams with a linear or circular incident

characterise the resolution of the superlens for different polarisation states.
We demonstrate how the 2D PSF may be used to design a simple diffractive
nanoelement consisting of two radial slits. The structure assures the
separation of non-diffracting radial beams originating from two slits in the

mass and the interaction strength to nuclei of the X as input parameters.
Nuclear reaction rates associated with the X are estimated naively, and adopted
in calculating evolutions of nuclear abundances. We suggest that the 7Li

active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is still unknown. The hard X-ray spectra of
Seyferts as well as of Galactic stellar-mass black holes (GBHs) are well
represented by thermal Comptonization, but the origin of the seed photons is
less certain. The MeV tails observed in GBHs provide evidence in favour of
non-thermal electron tails and it is possible that such electrons are also
present in the X-ray emitting regions of AGNs. Using simulations with the
kinetic code that self-consistently models electron and photon distributions,
we find that the power-law-like X-ray spectra in AGNs can be explained in terms
of the synchrotron self-Compton radiation of hybrid thermal/non-thermal
electrons, similarly to the hard/low state of GBHs. Under a very broad range of
parameters the model predicts a rather narrow distribution of photon spectral
slopes consistent with that observed from LINERs and Seyferts at luminosities
less than 3 per cent of the Eddington luminosity. The entire infrared to X-ray
spectrum of these objects can be described in terms of our model, suggesting a
tight correlation between the two energy bands. We show that the recently found
correlation between slope and the Eddington ratio at higher luminosities can be
described by the increasing fraction of disc photons in the emitting region,
which may be associated with the decreasing inner radius of the optically thick
accretion disc. The increasing flux of soft photons is also responsible for the
transformation of the electron distribution from nearly thermal to almost
completely non-thermal. The softer X-ray spectra observed in narrow-line
Seyfert galaxies may correspond to non-thermal Comptonization of the disc
photons, predicting that no cutoff should be observed up to MeV energies in
these sources, similarly to the soft-state GBHs.

  Comparison of Various User Selection Algorithms",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In multi-user communication from one base station (BS) to multiple users, the
problem of minimizing the transmit power to achieve some target guaranteed
performance (rates) at users has been well investigated in the literature.
Similarly various user selection algorithms have been proposed and analyzed
when the BS has to transmit to a subset of the users in the system, mostly for
the objective of the sum rate maximization.
  We study the joint problem of minimizing the transmit power at the BS to
achieve specific signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) targets at users
in conjunction with user scheduling. The general analytical results for the
average transmit power required to meet guaranteed performance at the users'
side are difficult to obtain even without user selection due to joint
optimization required over beamforming vectors and power allocation scalars. We
study the transmit power minimization problem with various user selection
algorithms, namely semi-orthogonal user selection (SUS), norm-based user
selection (NUS) and angle-based user selection (AUS). When the SINR targets to
achieve are relatively large, the average minimum transmit power expressions
are derived for NUS and SUS for any number of users. For the special case when
only two users are selected, similar expressions are further derived for AUS
and a performance upper bound which serves to benchmark the performance of
other selection schemes. Simulation results performed under various settings
indicate that SUS is by far the better user selection criterion.

era about the distribution of CR densities and the census of the interstellar
medium. The gradient of gamma-ray emissivities measured in the outer Galaxy is
significantly flatter than predictions from widely used CR propagation models
given the rapid decline of putative CR sources beyond the solar circle. Large
propagation volumes, with halo heights up to 20 kpc, or a flat CR source
distribution are required to match the data. Other viable possibilities include
non-uniform CR diffusion properties or more gas than accounted for by the
radio/mm-wave data. Gamma-ray data constrain the evolution of the
Xco=N(H2)/W(CO) ratio within a few kpc from the Sun. There is a significant
increase by a factor 2 from nearby clouds in the Gould Belt to the local spur.
No further significant variations are measured from the local spur to the
Perseus spiral arm. At the level of statistical accuracy provided by the LAT
data, the most important source of uncertainty, often overlooked so far, is due
to the optical depth correction applied to derive the column densities of H I.
Reliable determinations of the amount of atomic gas in the plane are key to
better probe the properties of CRs in the Galaxy.

high r-process enrichment (CEMP-s/r), incompatible with a pure s-process
contribution. CEMP-s stars are of low mass (M < 0.9 Msun) and belong to binary
systems. The C and s-process enrichment results from mass transfer by the winds
of the primary AGB companion (now a white dwarf). The nucleosynthesis of the
r-process, instead, is believed to occur in massive stars exploding as
Supernovae of Type II. The most representative r-process element is Eu (95% of
solar Eu). We suggest that the r-process enrichment was already present by
local SNII pollution in the molecular cloud from which the binary system
formed. The initial r-enrichment does not affect the s-process nucleosynthesis.
However, the s-process indicators [hs/ls] (where ls is defined as the average
of Y and Zr; hs as the average of La, Nd, Sm) and [Pb/hs] may depend on the
initial r-enhancement. For instance, the hs-peak has to account of an r-process
contribution estimated to be 30% for solar La, 40% for solar Nd, and 70% for
solar Sm. A large spread of [Eu/Fe] is observed in unevolved halo stars up to
[Eu/Fe] ~ 2. In presence of a very high initial r-enrichment of the molecular
cloud, the maximum [hs/Fe] predicted in CEMP-s/r stars may increase up to 0.3
dex. Instead, the spread of [Y,Zr/Fe] observed in unevolved halo stars reaches
a maximum of only ~ 0.5 dex, not affecting much the predicted [ls/Fe]. This is
in agreement with observations of CEMP-s/r stars that show an observed [hs/ls]
in average higher than that observed in CEMP-s. Preliminary results are
presented.

effective action for the case of ultra-static Riemannian spacetimes with
compact spatial section is discussed in general and a series representation,
valid when the chemical potential satisfies a certain constraint, is derived.

zero chemical potential. Although in this case we expect inhomogeneous phases
to occur only as meta-stable states, the problem is complex enough and allows
to illustrate how to implement numerical studies of inhomogeneous phases in

we propose to determine significance as $S =
\frac{n_{obs}-\lambda}{\sqrt{\lambda}}$. The significance $S$ coincides up to
sign with often used significance. For experiments which measure the same
quantities the natural but not unique rule for significance combining is
$S_{comb}(S_1, S_2) =
\frac{S_1\sigma_1+S_2\sigma_2}{\sqrt{\sigma^2_1+\sigma^2_2}}$, where $\sigma_1$
and $\sigma_2$ are variations. We also propose the rule for significances
combining for the case with systematic errors.

with continuous variables. An experimentally accessible criterion has been
proposed to measure the degree of non Gaussianity of quantum states, based on
the conditional entropy of the state with a Gaussian reference. Here we adopt
such criterion to characterise an important class of non classical states,
single-photon added coherent states. Our studies demonstrate the reliability
and sensitivity of this measure, and use it to quantify how detrimental is the
role of experimental imperfections in our realisation.

government bonds, corporate bonds and derivatives. Uncertainty is generated by
a general affine Markov process. The setting allows for stochastic volatility,
jumps, the possibility of default and correlation between different assets. We
show how to calculate discounted complex moments by solving a coupled system of
generalized Riccati equations. This yields an efficient method to compute
prices of power payoffs. European calls and puts as well as binaries and
asset-or-nothing options can be priced with the fast Fourier transform methods
of Carr and Madan (1999) and Lee (2005). Other European payoffs can be
approximated with a linear combination of government bonds, power payoffs and
vanilla options. We show the results to be superior to using only government
bonds and power payoffs or government bonds and vanilla options. We also give
conditions for European continent claims in our framework to be replicable if
enough financial instruments are liquidly tradable and study dynamic hedging
strategies. As an example we discuss a Heston-type stochastic volatility model
with possibility of default and stochastic interest rates.

homogeneous quantum computer. On a quantum computer the information cannot
propagate faster than $c=a/\tau$, $a$ and $\tau$ being the minimum space and
time distances between gates, respectively. It is shown that the information
flow satisfies a Dirac equation, with speed $v=\zeta c$ and $\zeta=\zeta(m)$
mass-dependent. For $a/\tau=c$ the speed of light $\zeta^{-1}$ is a vacuum

optimization destructively modifying the program to produce a transformed
program that is then passed to the next optimization. We present a new approach
for structuring the optimization phase of a compiler. In our approach,
optimizations take the form of equality analyses that add equality information
to a common intermediate representation. The optimizer works by repeatedly
applying these analyses to infer equivalences between program fragments, thus
saturating the intermediate representation with equalities. Once saturated, the
intermediate representation encodes multiple optimized versions of the input
program. At this point, a profitability heuristic picks the final optimized
program from the various programs represented in the saturated representation.
Our proposed way of structuring optimizers has a variety of benefits over
previous approaches: our approach obviates the need to worry about optimization
ordering, enables the use of a global optimization heuristic that selects among
fully optimized programs, and can be used to perform translation validation,
even on compilers other than our own. We present our approach, formalize it,
and describe our choice of intermediate representation. We also present
experimental results showing that our approach is practical in terms of time
and space overhead, is effective at discovering intricate optimization
opportunities, and is effective at performing translation validation for a
realistic optimizer.
