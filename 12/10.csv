simulations with two-flavor Wilson fermions. For this purpose, we investigate
screening masses of mesons in pseudo-scalar (PS) and vector (V) channels. The
simulations are performed on $16^3\times 4$ lattice along the lines of constant
physics at $m_{\rm PS}/m_{\rm V}|_{T=0}=0.65$ and 0.80, where $m_{\rm
PS}/m_{\rm V}|_{T=0}$ is a ratio of meson masses in PS and V channels at $T=0$.
A temperature range is $T/T_{\rm pc}=(0.8 - 4.0)$, where $T_{\rm pc}$ is the
pseudo-critical temperature. We find that the temperature dependence of the
screening masses normalized by temperature, $M_0/T$, shows notable structure
around $T_{\rm pc}$, and approach $2\pi$ at high temperature in both channels,
which is consistent with twice the thermal mass of a free quark in high
temperature limit. The screening masses at low density are also investigated by
using the Taylor expansion method with respect to the quark chemical potential.
We find that the expansion coefficients in the leading order become positive in
the temperature range, and thermal and density effect on the meson
screening-masses becomes apparent in the quark-gluon plasma phase. The meson
screening-masses are also compared with the gluon (Debye) screening masses at
finite temperature and density.

different [alpha/Fe] abundance ratios. The metal-poor component has an average
[alpha/Fe]=+0.34 +/- 0.06 r.m.s., consistent with the canonical scenario for
rapid enrichment by core collapse supernovae (SNe). The metal-rich component

of velocity of the 3889A and 10830A HeI* absorption lines. Since these lines
have the same lower levels, inhomogeneous absorption models could be used to
extract the average true HeI* column density; the log of that number was 14.9.
The total hydrogen column density was obtained using Cloudy models. A range of
ionization parameters and densities were allowed, with the lower limit on the
ionization parameter of log U=-1.4 determined by the requirement that there be
sufficient HeI*, and the upper limit on the density of log n=8 determined by
the lack of Balmer absorption. Simulated UV spectra showed that the ionization
parameter could be further constrained in principle using a combination of low
and high ionization lines (such as MgII and PV), but the only density-sensitive
line predicted to be observable and not significantly blended was CIII\lambda
1176. We estimated the outflow rate and kinetic energy, finding them to be
consistent but on the high side compared with analysis of other objects.
Assuming that radiative line driving is the responsible acceleration mechanism,
a force multipler model was constructed. A dynamical argument using the model
results strongly constrained the density to be log n >= ~7. Consequently, the
log hydrogen column density is constrained to be between 21.7 and 22.9, the
mass outflow rate to be between 11 and 56 solar masses per year, the ratio of
the mass outflow rate to the accretion rate to be between 1.2 and 5.8, and the

of little Higgs models. Tree-level exchange of TeV scale particles in a generic
little Higgs model produce higher dimensional operators that make contributions
to electroweak observables that are typically too large. To avoid this problem
a discrete symmetry dubbed T-parity can be introduced to forbid the dangerous
couplings. However, it was realized that in simple group models such as the
littlest Higgs model, the implementation of T-parity in a UV completion could
present some challenges. The situation is analogous to the one in QCD where the
pion can easily be defined as being odd under a new $Z_2$ symmetry in the
chiral Lagrangian, but this $Z_2$ is not a symmetry of the quark Lagrangian. In
this paper we examine the possibility of implementing a T-parity in the low
energy $SU(6)/Sp(6)$ model that might be easier to realize in the UV. In our
model, the T-parity acts on the low energy non-linear sigma model field in way
which is different to what was originally proposed for the Littlest Higgs, and
lead to a different low energy theory. In particular, the Higgs sector of this
model is a inert two Higgs doublets model with an approximate custodial
symmetry. We examine the contributions of the various sectors of the model to
electroweak precision data, and to the dark matter abundance.

coordination game with binary choice and give a condition for a new action to
become widespread in a random network. We also analyze the possible equilibria

large connected sets. Finally we look at how can firms use social networks to
promote their goals with limited information. Our results differ strongly from
the one derived with epidemic models and show that connectivity plays an
ambiguous role: while it allows the diffusion to spread, when the network is
highly connected, the diffusion is also limited by high-degree nodes which are
very stable.

fixed in a lattice, by a set of independent walkers. The target exhibits a
fluctuating behavior between trap and ordinary site of the lattice, whereas the
walkers perform an intermittent kind of search strategy. Our searchers carry
out their movements in one of two states between which they switch randomly.
One of these states (the exploratory phase) is a symmetric nearest neighbor
random walk and the other state (relocating phase) is a symmetric next-nearest
neighbor random walk. By using the multistate continuous-time random-walk
approach we are able to show that for dynamical targets, the intermittent
strategy (despite the simplicity of the kinetics chosen for searching) improves
detection, in comparison to displacements in a single state. We have obtained
analytic results, that can be numerically evaluated, for the Survival
Probability and for the Lifetime of the target. Thus, we have studied the
dependence of these quantities both in terms of the transition probability that
describes the dynamics of the target and in terms of the parameter that
characterizes the walkers' intermittency. In addition to our analytical
approach, we have implemented Monte Carlo simulations, finding excellent
agreement between the theoretical--numerical results and simulations.

One of the most important issues is related to their energy consumption, as

requirement is to ensure data sensing synchronization, which leads to
additional energy consumption as a high number of messages is sent and received
at each node. Our proposal consists in implementing a combined synchronization
protocol based on the IEEE 1588 standard that was designed for wired networks
and the PBS (Pairwise Broadcast Synchronization) protocol that was designed for
sensor networks, as none of them is able to provide the needed synchronization
accuracy for our application on its own. The main goals of our new
synchronization protocol are: to ensure the accuracy of local clocks up to a
tenth of a microsecond and to provide an important energy saving. Our results
obtained using NS-2 (Network Simulator) show that the performance of our

difficult to incorporate into statistical analyses. This article introduces a
straightforward framework of sentiment-preserving dimension reduction for text
data. Multinomial inverse regression is introduced as a general tool for
simplifying predictor sets that can be represented as draws from a multinomial
distribution, and we show that logistic regression of phrase counts onto
document annotations can be used to obtain low dimension document
representations that are rich in sentiment information. To facilitate this
modeling, a novel estimation technique is developed for multinomial logistic
regression with very high-dimension response. In particular, independent
Laplace priors with unknown variance are assigned to each regression
coefficient, and we detail an efficient routine for maximization of the joint
posterior over coefficients and their prior scale. This ""gamma-lasso"" scheme
yields stable and effective estimation for general high-dimension logistic
regression, and we argue that it will be superior to current methods in many
settings. Guidelines for prior specification are provided, algorithm
convergence is detailed, and estimator properties are outlined from the
perspective of the literature on non-concave likelihood penalization. Related
work on sentiment analysis from statistics, econometrics, and machine learning
is surveyed and connected. Finally, the methods are applied in two detailed

model where the state of the created Hawking pair at each stage is slightly
modified by the state of the previous pair. The model can be mapped onto the
1-dimensional Ising chain and solved explicitly. In agreement with the general
inequality we find that very little of the entanglement is removed by the
encoded correlations. We then use the general inequality to argue that the
black hole puzzles split into two problems: the `information paradox' and the
`infall problem'. The former addresses the detailed state of low energy modes
at the horizon and asks if these can be modified by order unity, while the
latter asks for a coarse grained effective description of the infall of heavy

formalism of braneworld scenarios in general, and also how it is possible to
measure such kind of effects, namely, for instance, the blackstring transverse
area corrections and variation of quasar luminosity due to those corrections.
We analyze the projected effective Einstein equation in a 4-dimensional
arbitrary manifold embedded in a 5-dimensional Riemann-Cartan manifold. The
Israel-Darmois matching conditions are investigated, in the context where the
torsion discontinuity is orthogonal to the brane. Unexpectedly, the presence of
torsion terms in the connection does not modify such conditions whatsoever,
despite of the modification in the extrinsic curvature and in the connection.
Then, by imposing the Z2-symmetry, the Einstein equation obtained via
Gauss-Codazzi formalism is extended, in order to now encompass the torsion
terms. We also show that the factors involving contorsion change drastically
the effective Einstein equation on the brane, as well as the effective
cosmological constant. Also, we present gravitational aspects of braneworld
models endowed with torsion terms both in the bulk and on the brane. In order
to investigate a conceivable and measurable gravitational effect, arising
genuinely from bulk torsion terms, we analyze the variation in the black hole
area by the presence of torsion. Furthermore, we extend the well known results
about consistency conditions in a framework that incorporates brane torsion
terms. It is shown, in a rough estimate, that the resulting effects are
generally suppressed by the internal space volume.

of $e^2/h$ for graphene's honeycomb lattice is proposed. I argue that, in the
presence of \emph{uniform} real and pseudo-magnetic fields, the valley
degeneracy from the higher Landau levels can be removed. A pseudo-magnetic
field may arise from bulging or stretching of the graphene flake. This may lead
to observation of plateaus in the Hall conductivity at quantized values $f
e^2/h$, with $f=\pm 3, \pm 5$ etc, which have not been observed in measurement
of Hall conductivity. However, in a collection of noninteracting Dirac fermions
living in the honeycomb lattice subject to real and pseudo field, the zeroth
Landau level still enjoys the valley and the spin degeneracy. Upon including
the Zeeman coupling, the spin degeneracy is removed from all the Landau levels.
The effects of short ranged electron-electron interactions are also considered,
particularly, the onsite Hubbard repulsion (U) and the nearest-neighbor Coulomb
repulsion (V). Within the framework of the extended Hubbard model with only
those two components of finite ranged Coulomb repulsion, it is shown that
infinitesimally weak interactions can place the system in a gapped insulating
phase by developing a \emph{ferrimegnatic} order, if $U>>V$. Therefore, one may
expect to see the plateaus in the Hall conductivity at all the integer values,
$f=0,\pm 1,\pm 2, \pm3,...$. Scaling behavior of interaction induced gap at
$f=1$ in presence of finite pseudo flux is also addressed. Qualitative
discussion on finite size effects and behavior of the interaction induced gap
when the restriction on uniformity of the fields are relaxed, is presented as
well. Possible experimental set up that can test relevance of our theory has
been proposed.

query complexity of the quantum state generation problem. This problem
encompasses both, the computation of partial or total functions and the
preparation of target quantum states. There has been hope for quite some time
that quantum state generation might be a route to tackle the {\sc Graph
Isomorphism} problem. We show that for the related problem of {\sc Index
Erasure} our method leads to a lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt N)$ which matches
an upper bound obtained via reduction to quantum search on $N$ elements. This
closes an open problem first raised by Shi [FOCS'02].
  Our approach is based on two ideas: (i) on the one hand we generalize the
known additive and multiplicative adversary methods to the case of quantum
state generation, (ii) on the other hand we show how the symmetries of the
underlying problem can be leveraged for the design of optimal adversary
matrices and dramatically simplify the computation of adversary bounds. Taken
together, these two ideas give the new result for {\sc Index Erasure} by using
the representation theory of the symmetric group. Also, the method can lead to
lower bounds even for small success probability, contrary to the standard
adversary method. Furthermore, we answer an open question due to \v{S}palek
[CCC'08] by showing that the multiplicative version of the adversary method is
stronger than the additive one for any problem. Finally, we prove that the
multiplicative bound satisfies a strong direct product theorem, extending a
result by \v{S}palek to quantum state generation problems.

concept of non-contextuality was introduced that applies also to the case of
outcome indeterminism and unsharp measurements. It was pointed out that the

non-contextuality implies non-contextuality for unsharp measurements. By noting

known structures: it is a new, nearby substructure in the Galaxy's halo. Using
a simple dynamical model of a dissolving satellite galaxy we account for the
localization of the stream. We find that the stream is dynamically young and
therefore likely the debris of a recently disrupted dwarf galaxy or globular

formation, rare for being right in the solar suburb.

galaxy halos. This cool circum-galactic component drops precipitously once the
galaxies cross the critical mass to form stable shocks, Mvir = Msh ~ 10^12
Msun. Before reaching Msh, the galaxies experience cold mode accretion (T<10^5
K) and show moderately high covering fractions in accreted gas: f_c ~ 30-50%
for R<50 co-moving kpc and N_HI>10^16 cm^-2. These values are considerably
lower than observed covering fractions, suggesting that outflowing gas (not
included here) is important in simulating galaxies with realistic gaseous
halos. Within ~500 Myr of crossing the Msh threshold, each galaxy transitions
to hot mode gas accretion, and f_c drops to ~5%. The sharp transition in
covering fraction is primarily a function of halo mass, not redshift. This
signature should be detectable in absorption system studies that target
galaxies of varying host mass, and may provide a direct observational tracer of
the transition from cold flow accretion to hot mode accretion in galaxies.

although relevant for many industrial processes, remain less well understood in
terms of fundamental fluid dynamics. Inviscid, and viscous Newtonian jets have
been studied in great detail; buckling instability in viscous jets leads to
regular periodic coiling of the jet that exhibits a non-trivial frequency
dependence with the height of the fall. Very few experimental or theoretical
studies exist for continuous viscoelastic jets beyond the onset of the first
instability. Here, we present a systematic study of the effects of
viscoelasticity on the dynamics of free surface continuous jets of surfactant
solutions that form worm-like micelles. We observe complex nonlinear
spatio-temporal dynamics of the jet and uncover a transition from periodic to
doubly-periodic or quasi-periodic to a multi-frequency, possibly chaotic
dynamics. Beyond this regime, the jet dynamics smoothly crosses over to exhibit
the ""leaping shampoo effect"" or the Kaye effect. This enables us to view
seemingly disparate jetting dynamics as one coherent picture of successive
instabilities and transitions between them. We identify the relevant scaling
variables as the dimensionless height, flow rate, and the elasto-gravity number
and present a regime map of the dynamics of the jet in terms of these

the behavior of fuzzy systems, but the comparison at this level is too coarse.
Recently, a finer behavioral measure, bisimulation, has been introduced to
fuzzy finite automata. However, the results obtained are applicable only to
finite-state systems. In this paper, we consider bisimulation for general fuzzy
systems which may be infinite-state or infinite-event, by modeling them as
fuzzy transition systems. To help understand and check bisimulation, we
characterize it in three ways by enumerating whole transitions, comparing
individual transitions, and using a monotonic function. In addition, we address
composition operations, subsystems, quotients, and homomorphisms of fuzzy
transition systems and discuss their properties connected with bisimulation.
The results presented here are useful for comparing the behavior of general
fuzzy systems. In particular, this makes it possible to relate an infinite
fuzzy system to a finite one, which is easier to analyze, with the same
behavior.

We then quantify how the escape dynamics from these almost-invariant sets are
connected with the second eigenfunctions of Perron-Frobenius (transfer)
operators when a small perturbation is applied near the intermittent fixed
point. In particular, we describe precisely the scaling of the second
eigenvalue with the perturbation size, provide upper and lower bounds, and
demonstrate $L^1$ convergence of the positive part of the second eigenfunction
to the ACIM as the perturbation goes to zero. This perturbation and associated

massive orbiting at ~13 primary radii in ~6.2 days. 1994 CC is a smaller system
with a primary of mass ~2.6 \times 10^11 kg and two satellites ~2% and ~1% as
massive orbiting at distances of ~5.5 and ~19.5 primary radii. Their orbital
periods are ~1.2 and ~8.4 days. Examination of resonant arguments shows that
the satellites are not currently in a mean-motion resonance. Precession of the
apses and nodes are detected in both systems (2001 SN263 inner body:
d{\varpi}/dt ~1.1 deg/day, 1994 CC inner body: d{\varpi}/dt ~ -0.2 deg/day),
which is in agreement with analytical predictions of the secular evolution due
to mutually interacting orbits and primary oblateness. Nonzero mutual
inclinations between the orbital planes of the satellites provide the best fits
to the data in both systems (2001 SN263: ~14 degrees, 1994 CC: ~16 degrees).
Our best-fit orbits are consistent with nearly circular motion, except for 1994
CC's outer satellite which has an eccentric orbit of e ~ 0.19. We examine
several processes that can generate the observed eccentricity and inclinations,
including the Kozai and evection resonances, past mean-motion resonance
crossings, and close encounters with terrestrial planets. In particular, we
find that close planetary encounters can easily excite the eccentricities and
mutual inclinations of the satellites' orbits to the currently observed values.

appearing at irregular times (the when). Neural responses often use spike
patterns to represent sensory information. The what is hypothesized to be
encoded in the identity of the elicited patterns (the pattern categories), and
the when, in the time positions of patterns (the pattern timing). However, this
standard view is oversimplified. In the real world, the what and the when might
not be separable concepts, for instance, if they are correlated in the
stimulus. In addition, neuronal dynamics can condition the pattern timing to be
correlated with the pattern categories. Hence, timing and categories of
patterns may not constitute independent channels of information. In this paper,
we assess the role of spike patterns in the neural code, irrespective of the
nature of the patterns. We first define information-theoretical quantities that
allow us to quantify the information encoded by different aspects of the neural
response. We also introduce the notion of synergy/redundancy between time
positions and categories of patterns. We subsequently establish the relation
between the what and the when in the stimulus with the timing and the
categories of patterns. To that aim, we quantify the mutual information between
different aspects of the stimulus and different aspects of the response. This
formal framework allows us to determine the precise conditions under which the
standard view holds, as well as the departures from this simple case. Finally,
we study the capability of different response aspects to represent the what and
the when in the neural response.

Faint NUV excesses increase with galaxy luminosity and are not correlated with
the presence or absence of HI in the environments of these galaxies. The faint
NUV excesses in the outskirts of early-type galaxies can be interpreted as
being due to star formation at or above a few \times 10-5 M\odot yr-1 kpc-2;
star formation at this rate can create a few percent of the mass of an

four times as many bright UV sources within 30 kpc compared to bright early
types (with MB < -21.3). The peak of the source distribution detected around
faint early types is less luminous and slightly bluer than the peak of the
sources detected around bright early types, indicating that early types with MB

strongly interacting and may be dominated by collective effects. In this
review, we provide a brief introduction for statistical physicists of the way
in which living cells communicate genetically through transferred genes, as
well as the ways in which they can reorganize their genomes in response to
environmental pressure. We discuss how genome evolution can be thought of as
related to the physical phenomenon of annealing, and describe the sense in
which genomes can be said to exhibit an analogue of information entropy. As a
direct application of these ideas, we analyze the variation with ocean depth of
transposons in marine microbial genomes, predicting trends that are consistent
with recent observations using metagenomic surveys.

baryons with spin 3/2. Therefore the Omega- magnetic moment is very accurately
known. Nevertheless, its electric quadrupole moment was never measured,
although estimates exist in different formalisms. In principle, lattice QCD
simulations provide at present the most appropriate way to estimate the Omega-
form factors, as function of the square of the transferred four-momentum, Q2,
since it describes baryon systems at the physical mass for the strange quark.
However, lattice QCD form factors, and in particular GE2, are determined at
finite Q2 only, and the extraction of the electric quadrupole moment, Q_Omega=
GE2(0) e/(2 M_Omega), involves an extrapolation of the numerical lattice
results. In this work we reproduce the lattice QCD data with a covariant
spectator quark model for Omega- which includes a mixture of S and two D states
for the relative quark-diquark motion. Once the model is calibrated, it is used
to determine Q_Omega. Our prediction is Q_Omega= (0.96 +/- 0.02)*10^(-2) efm2

to construct new stable equivalences of Morita type. Suppose that a stable
equivalence of Morita type between two algebras $A$ and $B$ is defined by a
$B$-$A$-bimodule $N$. Then, for any finite admissible set $\Phi$ and any
generator $X$ of the $A$-module category, the $\Phi$-Auslander-Yoneda algebras
of $X$ and $N\otimes_AX$ are stably equivalent of Morita type. Moreover, under
certain conditions, we transfer stable equivalences of Morita type between $A$
and $B$ to ones between $eAe$ and $fBf$, where $e$ and $f$ are idempotent
elements in $A$ and $B$, respectively. Consequently, for self-injective
algebras $A$ and $B$ over a field without semisimple direct summands, and for
any $A$-module $X$ and $B$-module $Y$, if the $\Phi$-Auslander-Yoneda algebras
of $A\oplus X$ and $B\oplus Y$ are stably equivalent of Morita type for one
finite admissible set $\Phi$, then so are the $\Psi$-Auslander-Yoneda algebras
of $A\oplus X$ and $B\oplus Y$ for {\it every} finite admissible set $\Psi$.
Moreover, two representation-finite algebras over a field without semisimple
direct summands are stably equivalent of Morita type if and only if so are
their Auslander algebras. As another consequence, we construct an infinite
family of algebras of the same dimension and the same dominant dimension such
that they are pairwise derived equivalent, but not stably equivalent of Morita

distribute unauthentic or harmful contents. Despite the existence of a number
of trust management schemes in the literature for combating against free riding

their high computational, communication and storage overhead. These schemes
also do not consider effect of trust management on quality-of-service (QoS) of

minimizes distribution of spurious files by a novel technique called topology
adaptation. It also reduces search time since most of the queries are resolved

as the network topology stabilizes. The mechanism is also found to be robust

pan-spectral fitting tools developed in a series of papers by Dopita and his
co-workers. We show that the standard Lee and Draine `astronomical silicate'
model cannot provide a good fit to the silicate absorption features as observed
in the heavily dust-extinguished ($A_{\rm V} \sim 50$mag.) starbursts. We have
derived an empirical fit to the `starburst silicate' absorption in these
objects. This absorption curve is consistent with the silicate grains being
systematically larger in starburst environments than in the local Galactic
interstellar medium. We demonstrate the sensitivity of the SED fitting to each
of the fitted parameters, and derive these parameters for those galaxies which
do not have an embedded AGN. This technique is simple and provides reasonably
robust and uniform parameters for the starburst, especially as far as the star
formation rate, population of old stars, compactness of the starburst region
and total foreground extinction are concerned. However, the chemical abundances
and the optical extinction cannot be reliably determined by this analysis, and
optical SEDs will also be required to provide a complete characterization of
the starburst region and of the surrounding galaxy.

$\D{B}$ of $B$, and $\D{A}$ of $A$. In particular, the kernel of the total left
derived functor $T\otimes_B^{\mathbb L}-$ is triangle equivalent to the derived
module category $\D{C}$. Conversely, if the functor $T\otimes_B^{\mathbb L}-$
admits a fully faithful left adjoint functor, then $T$ is a good tilting
module. We apply our result to tilting modules arising from ring epimorphisms,
and can then describe the rings $C$ as coproducts of two relevant rings.
Further, in case of commutative rings, we can weaken the condition of being
tilting modules, strengthen the rings $C$ as tensor products of two commutative
rings, and get similar recollements. Consequently, we can produce examples
(from commutative algebra and $p$-adic number theory, or Kronecker algebra) to
show that two different stratifications of the derived module category of a
ring by derived module categories of rings may have completely different
derived composition factors (even up to ordering and up to derived

case of two open modes (channels) is considered in great detail. Main attention
is paid to the transmission in dependence on various parameters of the model
with two types of rough-surface profiles (symmetric and antisymmetric). It is
shown that depending on the symmetry, basic mechanisms of scattering can be
either enhanced or suppressed. As a consequence, different transport regimes
can be realized. Specifically, in the waveguide with symmetric rough
boundaries, there are ballistic, localized and coexistence transport regimes.
In the waveguide with antisymmetric roughness of lateral walls, another regime
of the diffusive transport can arise. Our study allows to reveal the role of
the so-called square-gradient scattering which is typically neglected in
literature, however, can give a strong impact to the transmission.

with a transiting Jupiter-like body in a short-period orbit around an M star,
can create detectable TTV signals (Kirste \& Haghighipour, 2011). Given the low
masses of M stars and their circumstellar disks, it is expected that such a
transiting giant planet to have formed at large distances and migrated to its
close-in orbit. That implies, if such systems are discovered around M stars,
the terrestrial planet had to form during the migration of the giant planet.
The formation of this object may be either in-situ (in a close-in orbit)
followed by its capture in resonance, or the object is formed at larger
distances where it was subsequently captured in a resonance with the migrating
giant planet. We have investigated these two scenarios by simulating the
dynamics of a disk of protoplanetary embryos and the formation of terrestrial
planets during the migration of a Jupiter-like planet around an M star. Results
suggest that unless the migration of the giant planet is very slow (slower than
1E-7 AU/year), it is unlikely that the close-in terrestrial planet is formed
in-situ. If a terrestrial planet is detected in a mean-motion resonance with a
close-in giant planet around an M star, the terrestrial planet was most likley
formed at large distances and carried to its close-in resonant orbit by the
migrating giant body.

$n$ is sufficiently large, $\UT_n(q)$ has ``exotic'' irreducible characters
taking values outside the cyclotomic field $\QQ(\zeta_p)$. However, all proofs
of this fact to date have been both non-constructive and computer dependent. In
a preliminary work, we defined a family of orthogonal characters decomposing
the supercharacters of an arbitrary algebra group. By applying this
construction to the unitriangular group, we are able to derive by hand an
explicit description of a family of characters of $\UT_n(q)$ taking values in
arbitrarily large cyclotomic fields. In particular, we prove that if $r$ is a
positive integer power of $p$ and $n>6r$, then $\UT_n(q)$ has an irreducible
character of degree $q^{5r^2-2r}$ which takes values outside $\QQ(\zeta_{pr})$.
By the same techniques, we are also able to construct explicit Kirillov

well-studied history of extreme spectral variability and is an excellent
laboratory for studying the physical processes within the jets of active
galactic nuclei. However, there are few detailed multiwavelength studies of
Markarian 501 during its quiescent state, due to its low luminosity. A
short-term multiwavelength study of Markarian 501 was coordinated in March
2009, focusing around a multi-day observation with the Suzaku X-ray satellite
and including {\gamma}-ray data from VERITAS, MAGIC, and the Fermi Gamma-ray
Space Telescope with the goal of providing a well-sampled multiwavelength
baseline measurement of Markarian 501 in the quiescent state. The results of
these quiescent-state observations are compared to the historically extreme
outburst of April 16, 1997, with the goal of examining variability of the
spectral energy distribution between the two states. The derived broadband
spectral energy distribution shows the characteristic double-peaked profile. We
find that the X-ray peak shifts by over two orders of magnitude in photon
energy between the two flux states while the VHE peak varies little. The
limited shift in the VHE peak can be explained by the transition to the
Klein-Nishina regime. Synchrotron self-Compton models are matched to the data
and the implied Klein-Nishina effects are explored.

as graph drawing software. Complex systems (like large databases or networks)
that have a graph structure should be properly visualized in order to avoid
obfuscation. One way to provide an aesthetic improvement to a graph
visualization is to apply a force-directed drawing algorithm to it. This
method, that emerged in the 60's views graphs as spring systems that exert
forces (repulsive or attractive) to the nodes.
  A Lombardi drawing of a graph is a drawing where the edges are drawn as
circular arcs (straight edges are considered circular arcs of infinite radius)
with perfect angular resolution. This means, that consecutive edges around a
vertex are equally spaced around it. In other words, each angle between the
tangents of two consecutive edges is equal to $2\pi/d$ where d is the degree of
that specific vertex. The requirement of using circular edges in graphs when we
want to provide perfect angular resolution is necessary, since even cycle
graphs cannot be drawn with straight edges when perfect angular resolution is
needed.
  In this survey, we provide an algorithm that takes as input a random drawing
of a graph and provides its Lombardi drawing, giving a proper visualization of
the graph.

convex hull $\conv(\C)$ of $\C$ is difficult in general, both algorithmically

a class of configurations for which this problem can be solved to some extent.
Loosely speaking, a nearly convex polygon is an infinitesimal perturbation of a
weakly convex polygon (a convex polygon with edges subdivided by additional
points). Our main result shows that the triangulation polynomial, enumerating
all triangulations of a nearly convex polygon, is defined in a straightforward
way in terms of polynomials associated to the ``perturbed'' edges.

elementary embeddings j\colon V_\gamma \to V_\lambda. One key observation is
that such embeddings are uniquely determined by the image structures j [

be made in the s- and r-process. It has been found that massive stars can
produce p-nuclei through photodisintegration of pre-existing intermediate and
heavy nuclei. This so-called gamma-process requires sufficiently high
temperatures and occurs in pre-explosive or explosive O/Ne burning, depending
on the mass of the star. Although the gamma-process has been successful in
producing a large range of p-nuclei, two mass regions remain problematic, A<110
and 150<A<165, where a number of p-nuclei are severely underproduced. The
origin of the problems is yet to be identified. A large number of unstable
nuclei with only theoretically predicted reaction rates are included in the
reaction network and thus the nuclear input may involve uncertainties.
Deficiencies in charged-particle optical potentials at gamma-process
temperatures have been found for nuclei at stability. On the other hand, the
gamma-process conditions (temperature profiles, entropy of the O shell, seed
composition) also sensitively depend on details of the stellar structure and
evolution, as well as on the initial metallicity. Nevertheless, especially the
deficient low-mass p-nuclei may call for an additional production process or
site, such as production in (subChandrasekhar) type Ia supernovae. Also the
(im)possibility of a synthesis in the rp- and nu-p-processes is discussed. Were
this the case, the production of p-nuclei would be realized as a superposition
of several different processes, not necessarily in the same site.

when $X_i(n)=f_i({\Upsilon }_n)$, where ${\Upsilon }_n$ is a Markov chain
satisfying the Doeblin condition considered as a stationary process with

applications to other types of dynamical systems and Markov processes, for
instance, where a spectral gap can be established. The continuous time version
holds true when, for instance, $X_i(t)=f_i(\xi_t)$, where $\xi_t$ is a
nondegenerate continuous time Markov chain with a finite state space or a
nondegenerate diffusion on a compact manifold. A partial motivation for such
limit theorems is due to a series of papers dealing with nonconventional

2-complex. It can be sliced in graphs, where a change from one graph to another
can be organized by a sequence of local transitions, which are described in a
list of F. Quinn [Q1]. The decomposition of that 2-complex into graphs has to
be translated into an algebraic context (for example Topological Quantum field
theory (TQFT)) to construct suitable potential invariants under 3-deformations.
These invariants are accessible for computation by using a supercomputer and
the results may yield a counterexample to the Andrews-Curtis conjecture. To
achieve invariance under 3-deformations, there are obvious topological
relations among the local transitions, for example to deform a bubble out of a
rectangle. In this paper our main result is that we contribute a complete list
of such topological relations in a totally geometric fashion. One outcome of
our considerations is that the corresponding list of F. Quinn [Q1] is extended
by an additional relation which takes care of locally changing a slicing. We do
not know so far whether this relation is a consequence of the remaining ones.
But it may be crucial for further work to focus on such subtleties, as
algebraic ""simplifications"", where this question is bypassed, so far have been
unable to distinguish between simple homotopy and 3-deformations at all. In our
introduction we summarize some known results on the situation when passing to
Algebra; and in {\S} 8 we calculate an example of an algebraic TQFT in order to
demonstrate that our additional relation holds. All considerations are carried
out for 2-complexes with two generators and two defining relators. But the
results also hold in the general case.

whole a very sparse and unrepresentative stellar population in most Local Group
galaxies. However, more detailed studies of star formation histories and
chemical evolution properties of populations, like Main Sequence dwarf stars
and Red Giant Branch stars, allow a better understanding of the evolutionary
context in which AGB stars can be observed. There are a variety of galaxy types
in the Local Group which range from predominantly metal poor (e.g., Leo A) to
metal-rich (e.g., M 32). Dwarf galaxies are the most numerous type of galaxy in
the Local Group, and provide the opportunity to study a relatively simple,
typically metal-poor, environment that is likely similar to the conditions in
the early history of all galaxies. Hopefully the range of star formation
histories, peak star formation rates and metallicities will provide enough
information to properly calibrate observations of AGB stars in more distant
systems, and indeed in integrated spectra. Here I will summarise what we know
about the star formation histories of nearby galaxies and their chemical
evolution histories and then attempt to make a connection to their AGB star
properties.

cut-off effects are small for the curvature parameter and determine the

galaxies in clusters from z~0.8 to z~0, based on the WIde-field Nearby
Galaxy-cluster Survey (WINGS)(0.04<z<0.07), and the ESO Distant Cluster Survey
(EDisCS)(0.4<z<0.8). We first investigate a mass limited sample and we find
that, above a fixed mass limit, the ellipticity distribution of early-types
noticeably evolves with redshift. In the local Universe there are
proportionally more galaxies with higher ellipticity, hence flatter, than in
distant clusters. This evolution is due partly to the change of the mass
distribution and mainly to the change of the morphological mix with z (among
the early types, the fraction of ellipticals goes from ~70% at high to ~40% at
low-z). Analyzing separately the ellipticity distribution of the different
morphological types, we find no evolution both for ellipticals and S0s.
However, for ellipticals a change with redshift in the median value of the
distributions is detected. This is due to a larger population of very round
(e<0.05) elliptical galaxies at low-z. To compare our finding to previous
studies, we also assemble a magnitude-""delimited"" sample that consists of
early-type galaxies on the red sequence with -19.3>M_B+1.208z>-21. Analyzing
this sample, we do not recover exactly the same results of the mass-limited
sample. Hence the selection criteria are crucial to characterize the galaxy
properties: the choice of the magnitude-delimited sample implies the loss of
many less massive galaxies and so it biases the final results. Moreover,
although we are adopting the same selection criteria, our results in the
magnitude-delimited sample are also not in agreement with those of Holden et
al.(2009). This is due to the fact that our and their low-z samples have a
different magnitude distribution because the Holden et al.(2009) sample suffers
from incompleteness at faint magnitudes.

the individual spectra of the components of a multiple star system from
composite spectra observed at a range of orbital phases. This method has
several advantages: it is unaffected by line blending, does not use template
spectra, and returns individual component spectra with very high
signal-to-noise ratios. The disentangled spectra of a binary star system are
very well suited to spectroscopic analysis but for one problem: the absolute
spectral line depths are unknown because this information is not contained in
the original spectra (unless there is one taken in eclipse) without making
assumptions about the spectral characteristics of the component stars. Here we
present a method for obtaining the atmospheric parameters of the component
stars by the constrained fitting of synthetic spectra to observed and
disentangled spectra. Disentangled spectra are fitted using synthetic spectra
and a genetic algorithm in order to determine the effective temperatures,
surface gravities and relative light contributions of the two stars in a binary

have been generalized to the case of matrices by several authors over a period

some cases coincide with, and in other cases are at variance with the
corresponding inequalities for real numbers. We survey some of these matrix
inequalities and do further investigations into these.
  We introduce the novel notion of dominated majorization between the spectra
of two Hermitian matrices $B$ and $C$, dominated by a third Hermitian matrix
$A$. Based on an explicit formula for the gradient of the sum of the $k$
largest eigenvalues of a Hermitian matrix, we show that under certain

relation between the diagonal elements of $B$ and $C$ in a certain basis. We
use this notion as a tool to give new, elementary proofs for the sub-additivity
inequality for non-negative concave functions first proved by Bourin and
Uchiyama and the corresponding super-additivity inequality for non-negative
convex functions first proven by Kosem.
  Finally, we present counterexamples to some conjectures that Ando's
inequality for operator convex functions could more generally hold, e.g.\ for
ordinary convex, non-negative functions.

by considering the structural peculiarities of the materials, especially the

a jet on the axis of a magnetic cavity is collimated by a toroidal magnetic
field as it expands into the ambient medium. The jets in the experiments have
similar Mach number, plasma beta and cooling parameter to those in protostellar
jets. Additionally the Reynolds, magnetic Reynolds and Peclet numbers are much
larger than unity, allowing the experiments to be scaled to astrophysical
flows. The experimental configuration allows for the generation of episodic
magnetic cavities, suggesting that periodic fluctuations near the source may be
responsible for some of the variability observed in astrophysical jets.

fields as well as to understand the configurations and the kinetic processes.
Compared with the isothermal phase separation, the freedom in temperature
prolongs the Spinodal Decomposition (SD) stage and induces different
rheological and morphological behaviors in the thermal system. After the
transient procedure, both the thermal and isothermal separations show power-law
scalings in domain growth; while the exponent for thermal system is lower than
that for isothermal system. With respect to the density of field, the
isothermal system presents more likely bicontinuous configurations with
narrower interfaces, while the thermal system presents more likely
configurations with scattered bubbles. Heat creation, conduction and lower
interfacial stresses are main reasons for the differences in thermal system.
Different from the case with isothermal phase separation, the release of latent
heat causes the changing of local temperature which results in new local
mechanical balance. When the Prandtl number becomes smaller, the system
approaches thermodynamical equilibrium more quickly. The increasing of mean
temperature makes lower the interfacial stress in the following way:
$\sigma=\sigma_{0}[(T_{c}-T)/(T_{c}-T_{0})]^{3/2}$, where $T_{c}$ is the
critical temperature and $\sigma_{0}$ is the interfacial stress at a reference
temperature $T_{0}$, which is the main reason for lower growth exponent in
thermal case.

  We then apply our covering scheme to a variation of this covering problem
where one wants to cover [-1+epsilon,1-epsilon]^n with parallelepipeds that, if
scaled by two, are still contained in the unit cube. Thereby, we obtain a
method to boost any 2-approximation algorithm for closest-vector in the
infinity norm to a (1+epsilon)-approximation algorithm that has the desired

electron neutrino mass with sub-electronvolt sensitivity. Calorimetric neutrino
mass experiments measure all the energy released in a beta decay except for the
energy carried away by the neutrino, therefore removing the most severe
systematic uncertainties which have plagued the traditional and, so far, more
sensitive spectrometers. Calorimetric measurements are best realized exploiting
the thermal detection technique. This approach uses thermal microcalorimeters
whose absorbers contain a low transition energy Q beta decaying isotope. To
date the two best options are 187Re and 163Ho. While the first beta decays, the
latter decays via electron capture, but both have a Q value around 2.5 keV. The
potential of using 187Re for a calorimetric neutrino mass experiment has been
already demonstrated. On the contrary, no calorimetric spectrum of 163Ho has
been so far measured with the precision required to set a useful limit on the
neutrino mass. In this talk we present the status and the perspectives of the
MARE project activities for the active isotope selection and the single channel
development. We also discuss the neutrino mass statistical sensitivity
achievable with both isotopes.

(Super-symmetry, Universal Extra Dimensions, etc.) predict Weakly Interacting
Massive Particles (WIMPs) as natural DM candidates at the weak scale.
Self-annihilation (or decay) of WIMPs might produce secondary gamma-rays, via
hadronization or as final state radiation. Since its launch in the 2008, the
Large Area Telescope on-board of the Fermi gamma-ray Space Telescope has
detected the largest amount of gamma-rays to date, in the 20MeV 300GeV energy
range, allowing to perform a very sensitive indirect experimental search for DM
(by means of high-energy gamma-rays). DM forms large gravitationally bounded
structures, the halos, which can host entire galaxies, such as the Milky Way.
The DM distribution in the central part of the halos is not experimentally
know, despite a very large density enhancement might be present. As secondary
gamma rays production is very sensitive to WIMP density, a very effective
search can be performed from the regions where the largest density is expected.
Therefore the information provided by the DM halo N-body simulations are
crucial. The largest gamma-ray signal from DM annihilation is expected from the
centre of the Galaxy. In the same region a large gamma-ray background is
produced by bright discrete sources and the cosmic-rays interacting with the
interstellar gas and the photons fields.
  Here we report an update of the indirect search for DM from the Galactic

discuss how this system can be generated experimentally. In the absence of
disorder, the BCS regime is characterized by pair breaking and phase coherence
temperature scales which are essentially the same allowing strong correlations
between the amplitude and phase of the order parameter for superfluidity. As
non-pair breaking disorder is introduced the largely overlapping Cooper pairs
conspire to maintain phase coherence such that the critical temperature remains
essentially unchanged, and Anderson's theorem is satisfied. However in the BEC
regime the pair breaking and phase coherence temperature scales are very
different such that non-pair breaking disorder can affect dramatically phase
coherence, and thus the critical temperature, without the requirement of
breaking tightly-bound fermion pairs simultaneously. In this case, Anderson's
theorem does not apply, and the critical temperature can be more easily reduced
in comparison to the BCS limit. Lastly, we find that the superfluid is more
robust against disorder in the intermediate region near unitarity between the

of opposite chirality. Here we monitor the relative magnetic helicity contained
in the coronal volume of a simulated flux rope CME, as well as the upward flux
of relative helicity through horizontal planes in the simulation box. The
unstable and erupting flux rope carries away only a minor part of the initial
relative helicity; the major part remains in the volume. This is a consequence
of the requirement that the current through an expanding loop must decrease if
the magnetic energy of the configuration is to decrease as the loop rises, to
provide the kinetic energy of the CME.

potential for muon neutrinos in terrestrial long-baseline experiments. The
potential changes sign for anti-neutrinos and hence can lead to apparent
differences in neutrino and anti-neutrino oscillations without introducing CP

the level of primordial non-Gaussianity $f_\mathrm{NL}$ and the amplitude of

is particularly evident for the less studied non-Gaussian bispectrum shapes,
the so-called enfolded and the orthogonal ones. Setting constraints on these
