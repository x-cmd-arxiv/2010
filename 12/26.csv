white light cavities. For application to telecommunication systems, it would be
convenient to realize such a device using fiber optic resonators. In this
paper, we present the design of such a system, where the white light cavity
effect is produced by using stimulated Brillouin scattering. The system
consists of a pair of fiber optic white light cavities placed in series. As in
the original proposal, the delay time can be controlled independently of the
bandwidth of the data pulses. Furthermore, we show how the bandwidth of the
system can be made as large as several times the Brillouin frequency shift. We
also show that the net delay achievable in such a buffer can be significantly
larger than what can be achieved using a conventional recirculating loop
buffer.

extends the numerical differentiation by integration method introduced by
Lanczos. The here proposed method is used to estimate the $n^{th}$ ($n \in

at least $C^{n+1+q}$ $(q \in \mathbb{N})$. In the recent paper of Mboup, Fliess
and Join, where the causal and anti-causal case were investigated, the
mismodelling due to the truncation of the Taylor expansion was investigated and
improved allowing a small time-delay in the derivative estimation. Here, for
the central case, we show that the bias error is $O(h^{q+2})$ where $h$ is the
integration window length for $f\in C^{n+q+2}$ in the noise free case and the
corresponding convergence rate is $O(\delta^{\frac{q+1}{n+1+q}})$ where
$\delta$ is the noise level for a well chosen integration window length.
Numerical examples show that this proposed method is stable and effective.

fractional quantum Hall states (FQHS) is totally quenched, the Hamiltonian
describing the system comprises of the electron correlation and tunneling
terms. The correlations are captured by the 'so-called' Haldane
pseudo-potentials(HPP). We employ the finite-temperature formalism involving
Matsubara propagators to deal with this Hamiltonian. We show that the system
undergoes a zero-order quantum phase transition (QPT), at fixed charge
imbalance regulatory(CIR) parameter and constant layer separation as the
inter-layer tunneling (ILT)strength is increased, from the effective
two-component state (two independent layers) to an effective single-component
state (practically a single layer). At finite and constant ILT strength, a
transition from the latter state to the former state is also possible upon
increasing CIR parameter. We identify the order parameter to describe this QPT
as a pseudo-spin component and calculate the order parameter with the aid of
the Matsubara propagators. The clear finger-print of this QPT is obtained up to
temperature equal to 100 K.

($\partial^{2} E/\partial b^{2}=M^{2})$ conditions force the effective
potential of this theory to be bounded from below (stable). Since bounded from
below potentials are always associated with localized wave functions, the
algorithm we use replaces the boundary condition applied to the wave functions
in the complex contour method by two stability conditions on the effective
potential obtained. To test the validity of our calculations, we show that our
variational predictions can reproduce exactly the results in the literature for
the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric $\phi^{4}$ theory. We then extend the applications
of the algorithm to the unstudied stability problem of the bounded from above
$(-\phi^{6})$ scalar field theory where classical analysis prohibits the
existence of a stable spectrum. Concerning this, we calculated the effective
potential up to first order in the couplings in $d$ space-time dimensions. We
find that a Hermitian effective theory is instable while a non-Hermitian but
$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric effective theory characterized by a pure imaginary
vacuum condensate is stable (bounded from below) which is against the classical
predictions of the instability of the theory. We assert that the work presented
here represents the first calculations that advocates the stability of the

definition of individual fitness which integrates the environment, denoted by
the average payoff of all individual neighbors, with the traditional individual
payoffs by introducing a selection parameter $u$. Tuning $u$ equal to zero
returns the traditional version, while increasing $u$ bears the influence of

provide quantitative explanations and complete phase diagrams presenting the

penguin annihilation can account for theobserved rates of penguin-dominated
two-body decays of $B$ mesons and direct CP asymmetries $A_{CP}(K^-\pi^+)$,
$A_{CP}((K^{*-}\pi^+)$, $A_{CP}((K^-\rho^0)$ and $A_{CP}((\pi^+\pi^-)$.
However, the predicted direct CP-violating effects in QCDF for $B^-\to
K^-\pi^0,K^-\eta,\pi^-\eta$ and $\bar B^0\to\pi^0\pi^0$ are wrong in signs when
confronted with experiment. We consider two different types of power correction
effects in order to resolve the CP puzzles and rate deficit problems with
penguin-dominated two-body decays of $B$ mesons and color-suppressed
tree-dominated $\pi^0\pi^0$ and $\rho^0\pi^0$ modes: penguin annihilation and
soft corrections to the color-suppressed tree amplitude.

However, caGrid's current querying functionality depends on the structure of
individual data resources without exploiting the semantic annotations. In this
paper, we present the design and development of an ontology-based querying
functionality that consists of: the generation of OWL2 ontologies from the
underlying data resources metadata and a query rewriting and translation
process based on reasoning, which converts a query at the domain ontology level
into queries at the software infrastructure level. We present a detailed
analysis of our approach as well as an extensive performance evaluation. While
the implementation and evaluation was performed for the caGrid infrastructure,
the approach could be applicable to other model and metadata-driven

including forecasts for cycle 24 and focusing on aspects of the solar cycle
prediction problem that have a bearing on dynamo theory. The scope of the
review is further restricted to the issue of predicting the amplitude (and
optionally the epoch) of an upcoming solar maximum no later than right after
the start of the given cycle. Prediction methods form three main groups.
Precursor methods rely on the value of some measure of solar activity or
magnetism at a specified time to predict the amplitude of the following solar
maximum. Their implicit assumption is that each numbered solar cycle is a
consistent unit in itself, while solar activity seems to consist of a series of
much less tightly intercorrelated individual cycles. Extrapolation methods, in
contrast, are based on the premise that the physical process giving rise to the
sunspot number record is statistically homogeneous, i.e., the mathematical
regularities underlying its variations are the same at any point of time, and
therefore it lends itself to analysis and forecasting by time series methods.
Finally, instead of an analysis of observational data alone, model based
predictions use physically (more or less) consistent dynamo models in their
attempts to predict solar activity. In their overall performance precursor
methods have clearly been superior to extrapolation methods. Nevertheless, some
extrapolation methods may still be worth further study. Model based forecasts
have not yet have had a chance to prove their skills. One method that has
yielded predictions consistently in the right range during the past few solar
cycles is that of K. Schatten et al., whose approach is mainly based on the
polar field precursor. The incipient cycle 24 will probably mark the end of the
Modern Maximum, with the Sun switching to a state of less strong activity.

Rb$_{0.78}$Fe$_2$Se$_{1.78}$, which shows sharp superconducting transition in
magnetic susceptibility and electrical resistivity. Resistivity measurements
show the onset superconducting transition ($T_{\rm c}$) at 32.1 K and zero
resistivity at 30 K. From the low-temperature iso-magnetic-field
magnetoresistance, large upper critical field $H_{\rm c2}$(0) has been
estimated as high as 180 T for in-plane field and 59 T for out-of-plane field.
The anisotropy $H^{ab}_{\rm c2}$(0)/$H^{c}_{\rm c2}$(0) is around 3.0, right
lying between those observed in K$_x$Fe$_2$Se$_2$ and Cs$_x$Fe$_2$Se$_2$.
