systems to external inputs. The motivation arises from molecular systems
biology. and, in particular, the recent discovery of an important transient
property, related to Weber's law in psychophysics: ""fold-change detection"" in
adapting systems, the property that scale uncertainty does not affect
responses. FCD appears to play an important role in key signaling transduction
mechanisms in eukaryotes, including the ERK and Wnt pathways, as well as in
E.coli and possibly other prokaryotic chemotaxis pathways. In this paper, we
provide further theoretical results regarding this property. Far more
generally, we develop a necessary and sufficient characterization of adapting
systems whose transient behaviors are invariant under the action of a set
(often, a group) of symmetries in their sensory field. A particular instance is
FCD, which amounts to invariance under the action of the multiplicative group
of positive real numbers. Our main result is framed in terms of a notion which
extends equivariant actions of compact Lie groups. Its proof relies upon
control theoretic tools, and in particular the uniqueness theorem for minimal
realizations.

All the invisibility cloaks demonstrated thus far, however, have relied on
nano- or micro-fabricated artificial composite materials with spatially varying
electromagnetic properties, which limit the size of the cloaked region to a few

factorization works well - as is theoretically expected - for color-allowed,

non-factorizable character, do not show any anomalous behavior. We discuss also
isospin triangles between the B -> D^{(*)} pi decay amplitudes, and determine
the corresponding amplitudes in the complex plane, which show a significant
enhancement of the color-suppressed tree contribution with respect to the
factorization picture. Using data for B -> D^{(*)} K decays, we determine
SU(3)-breaking effects and cannot resolve any non-factorizable SU(3)-breaking
corrections larger than \sim 5%. In view of these results, we point out that a
comparison between the \bar B^0_d -> D^+\pi^- and \bar B^0_s -> D_s^+\pi^-

obtain the most precise value of this ratio at CDF, and discuss the prospects

determine the stability of the radio cores, and to assess structure effects
associated with positions in the ICRF. Although the four sources were compact
at 8.6 GHz, the VLBA images at 43 GHz with 0.3-mas resolution showed that all
were composed of several components. A component in each source was identified
as the radio core using some or all of the following emission properties:
compactness, spectral index, location at the end of the extended emission
region, and stationary in the sky. Over the observing period, the relative
positions between the four radio cores were constant to 0.02 mas---the phase
referencing positional accuracy obtained at 23 and 43 GHz among the
sources---suggesting that once a radio core is identified, it remains
stationary in the sky to this accuracy. Other radio components in two of the
four sources had detectable motion in the radio jet direction. Comparison of
the 23 and 43 GHz VLBA images with the VLBA 8.6 GHz images and the ICRF
positions suggests that some ICRF positions are dominated by a moving jet
component; hence, they can be displaced up to 0.5 mas from the radio core, and
may also reflect the motion of the jet component. Future astrometric efforts to
determine a more accurate quasar reference frame at 23 and 43 GHz and from the
VLBI2010 project are discussed, and supporting VLBA or EVN observations of ICRF
sources at 43 GHz are recommended in order to determine the internal structure
of the sources. A future collaboration between the radio (ICRF) and the optical
frame of Gaia is discussed.

galaxy M32 and the post-starburst galaxy NGC 5102. We show that features from
thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) and main sequence turn-off
(MSTO) stars yield similar ages to those derived from optical spectra. The
TP-AGB can dominate the NIR flux of a coeval stellar population between ~0.1
and ~2 Gyr, and the strong features of (especially C-rich) TP-AGB stars are
useful chronometers in integrated light studies. Likewise, the Paschen series
in MSTO stars is stongly dependent on age and is an indicator of a young
stellar component in integrated spectra. We define four NIR spectroscopic
indices to measure the strength of absorption features from both C-rich TP-AGB
stars and hydrogen features in main sequence stars, in a preliminary effort to
construct a robust chronometer that probes the contributions from stars in
different evolutionary phases. By comparing the values of the indices measured
in M32 and NGC 5102 to those in the Maraston (2005) stellar population
synthesis models for various ages and metallicities, we show that model
predictions for the ages of the nuclei of M32 and NGC 5102 agree with previous
results obtained from integrated optical spectroscopy and CMD analysis of the
giant branches. The indices discriminate between an intermediate age population
of ~3-4 Gyr, a younger population of <1 Gyr, and can also detect the signatures
of very young (<100 Myr) populations.

diffusion from viscosity similar to that observed during the cooling of

the electronic structures of two rotational variants of epitaxial, single-layer
graphene on Ir(111). As grown, the more-abundant R0 variant is nearly
charge-neutral, with strong hybridization between graphene and Ir bands near
the Fermi level. The graphene Fermi surface and its replicas exactly coincide
with Van Hove singularities in the Ir Fermi surface. Sublattice symmetry
breaking introduces a small gap-inducing potential at the Dirac crossing, which
is revealed by n-doping the graphene using K atoms. The energy gaps between
main and replica bands (originating from the moir\'e interference pattern
between graphene and Ir lattices) is shown to be non-uniform along the mini-
zone boundary due to hybridization with Ir bands. An electronically mediated
interaction is proposed to account for the stability of the R0 variant. The
variant rotated 30{\deg} in-plane, R30, is p-doped as grown and K doping
reveals no band gap at the Dirac crossing. No replica bands are found in ARPES
measurements. Raman spectra from the R30 variant exhibit the characteristic
phonon modes of graphene, while R0 spectra are featureless. These results show
that the film/substrate interaction changes from chemisorption (R0) to
physisorption (R30) with in-plane orientation. Finally, graphene-covered Ir has
a work function lower than the clean substrate but higher than graphite.

make mobile clients directional with beamsteering. We first demonstrate that
beamsteering is already feasible to mobile devices such as Netbooks and eBook

further reveal that beamsteering mobile clients face a unique challenge to

transmit power that achieve the required capacity with lowest power. Finally,
we provide a distributed algorithm called BeamAdapt that allows each client to
closely approach its optimal point iteratively without central coordination. We

high-redshift Universe, shaping the properties of the circum-galactic medium,
enriching the IGM with metals and driving the evolution of low-mass galaxies.
However, it is not yet fully understood how SNe driven winds interact with
their surroundings in a cosmological context, nor is it clear whether they are
able to significantly impact the evolution of low-mass galaxies from which they
originate by altering the amount of cold material these accrete from the cosmic
web. We implement a standard Taylor-Sedov type solution, widely used in the
community to depict the combined action of many SN explosions, in a
cosmological resimulation of a low mass galaxy at z =9 from the 'Nut' suite.
However, in contrast with previous work, we achieve a resolution high enough to
capture individual SN remnants in the Taylor-Sedov phase, for which the
solution provides an accurate description of the expansion. We report the
development of a high-velocity, far-reaching galactic wind produced by the
combined action of SNe in the main galaxy and its satellites, which are located
in the same or a neighbouring dark matter halo. Despite this, we find that (i)
this wind carries out very little mass (the measured outflow is of the order of
a tenth of the inflow/star formation rate) and (ii) the cold gas inflow rate
remains essentially unchanged from the run without SNe feedback. Moreover,
there are epochs during which star formation is enhanced in the feedback run
relative to its radiative cooling only counterpart. We attribute this
'positive' feedback to the metal enrichment that is present only in the former.
We conclude that at very high redshift, efficient SNe feedback can drive
large-scale galactic winds but does not prevent massive cold gas inflow from
fuelling galaxies, resulting in long-lived episodes of intense star
formation.(abridged)

To establish the balance one has to take into account the initial and final
conditions for acceleration, or to apply averaging. In curved space-time an
additional contribution arises from the tidal deformation of the bound field.
This force is shown to be the finite remnant from the mass renormalization and
it is different both form the radiation recoil force and the Schott force. For
radiation of non-gravitational nature from point particles in curved space-time
the reaction force can be computed substituting the retarded field directly to

radiation in vacuum space-time, but fails in the non-vacuum case. The existence
of the gravitational quasilocal reaction force in this general case seems

Even quarter of a century after the first report of high temperature

consensus on the pairing mechanism of superconductivity in these materials. So
far, many theories have been developed to explain the exotic properties of
cuprates, but they can explain only a limited number of experiments. In this
article, we present a new pairing mechanism that incorporates both strong
correlation and phonon mediated interaction on an equal footing to produce
superconductivity. In this framework, strong correlation and anti-ferromagnetic
interaction between electrons, create RVB pairs and phonons provide the phase
coherence between these RVB pairs. Both of these are required in this approach

the U(1) slave boson method. We achieve a better estimation of $T_c$, we only
predict $\frac{h}{2ec}$ vortices and the linear $T$ coefficient of the
superfluid is not sensitive to the doping. This formalism provides a framework
that connects Anderson's idea of preformed Cooper pairs and phonon based
theories.

perturbations have zero ensemble mean. This property is one of the consequences
of statistically homogeneity, the invariance of correlation functions under
spatial translations. In this article we explore whether cosmological
perturbations indeed have zero mean, and thus test one aspect of statistical
homogeneity. We carry out a classical test of the zero mean hypothesis against
a class of alternatives in which perturbations have non-vanishing means, but
homogeneous and isotropic covariances. Apart from Gaussianity, our test does
not make any additional assumptions about the nature of the perturbations and
is thus rather generic and model-independent. The test statistic we employ is
essentially Student's t statistic, applied to appropriately masked,
foreground-cleaned cosmic microwave background anisotropy maps produced by the
WMAP mission. We find evidence for a non-zero mean in a particular range of
multipoles, but the evidence against the zero mean hypothesis goes away when we
correct for multiple testing. We also place constraints on the mean of the
temperature multipoles as a function of angular scale. On angular scales
smaller than four degrees, a non-zero mean has to be at least an order of
magnitude smaller than the standard deviation of the temperature anisotropies.

of quantum states each having macroscopic occupation; Type II has condensation
into a continuous band of states, with each state having macroscopic

condensate band is macroscopically occupied. We begin by discussing Type I or
""normal"" BEC into a single state for an isotropic harmonic oscillator
potential. Other geometries and external potentials are then considered: the
{}""channel"" potential (harmonic in one dimension and hard-wall in the other),
which displays Type II, the {}""cigar trap"" (anisotropic harmonic potential),
and the ""Casimir prism"" (an elongated box), the latter two having Type III
condensations. General box geometries are considered in an appendix. We
particularly focus on the cigar trap, which Van Druten and Ketterle first
showed had a two-step condensation: a GBEC into a band of states at a
temperature $T_{c}$ and another ""one-dimensional"" transition at a lower
temperature $T_{1}$ into the ground state. In a thermodynamic limit in which
the ratio of the dimensions of the anisotropic harmonic trap is kept fixed,
$T_{1}$ merges with the upper transition, which then becomes a normal BEC.
However, in the thermodynamic limit of Beau and Zagrebnov, in which the ratio
of the boundary lengths increases exponentially, $T_{1}$ becomes fixed at the
temperature of a true Type I phase transition. The effects of interactions on
GBEC are discussed and we show that there is evidence that Type III
condensation may have been observed in the cigar trap.

80% of these spectra are fitted by a power law with an exponential cutoff, and

-- are simple extensions of the standard model present in many theories of new
physics such as little Higgs models, topcolor models, and extra dimensions.
Through renormalizable mixing with the top quark, these top-partners inherit
couplings to the Higgs boson. Higgs bosons produced from the decay of
top-partners are often highly boosted and ideal candidates for analyses based
on jet substructure. Using substructure methods, we show that light Higgs
bosons decaying to b b-bar can be discovered at the 14 TeV LHC with less than
10 inverse fb for top-partner masses up to 1 TeV.

the current article we extend this bound to rotating systems. This extension is
less simple than one might at first suppose. Purely classically, (using only
classical general relativity and basic thermodynamics), it is possible to show
that the entropy of uncollapsed matter inside a region enclosed by a surface of

kappa(surface) is a suitably defined surface gravity. By appealing to the Unruh

suitable class of fiducial observers there is a lower bound on the temperature

we are able to argue that for uncollapsed matter S <= {1/2} A.

a) in a cosmology-independent way, if the sum of neutrino masses is above 0.1

suited to span the entire range of neutrino masses allowed by neutrino
oscillation experiments, and to yield a clear detection of non-zero neutrino
mass. The detection of the cosmic relic neutrino background with cosmological

measures predict the double coincidence that most observers live at the onset
of vacuum domination and just before the onset of curvature domination. The
hierarchy between the Planck scale and the cosmological constant is related to
the number of vacua in the landscape. These results require only mild
assumptions about the distribution of vacua (somewhat stronger assumptions are
required by the fat geodesic measure). At this level of generality, none of the
three measures are successful for vacua with negative cosmological constant.
Their applicability in this regime is ruled out unless much stronger anthropic

study the structure of the broad line region and measure the size of the region
emitting the CIV and CIII] lines.
  Methods: Based on 39 spectrophotometric monitoring data points obtained
between Oct. 2004 and Dec. 2007, we derived lightcurves for the CIV and CIII]
emission lines. We used three different techniques to analyse the microlensing
signal. Different components of the lines (narrow, broad and very broad) are
identified and studied. We built a library of simulated microlensing
lightcurves that reproduce the signal observed in the continuum and in the
lines provided only the source size is changed. A Bayesian analysis scheme is
then developed to derive the size of the various components of the BLR.
  Results: 1. The half-light radius of the region emitting the CIV line is
found to be R_CIV ~ 66^{+110}_{-46} lt-days = 0.06$^{+0.09}_{-0.04}$ pc =
1.7$^{+2.8}_{-1.1}$\,10$^{17}$ cm (at 68.3% CI). Similar values are obtained
for CIII]. Relative sizes of the carbon-line and V-band continuum
emitting-regions are also derived with median values of R(line)/R(cont) in the
range 4 to 29, depending of the FWHM of the line component.
  2. The size of the CIV emitting region agrees with the Radius-Luminosity
relationship derived from reverberation mapping. Using the virial theorem we
derive the mass of the black hole in Q2237+0305 to be M_BH ~ 10^{8.3+/-0.3}
M_sun.
  3. We find that the CIV and CIII] lines are produced in at least 2 spatially
distinct regions, the most compact one giving rise to the broadest component of
the line. The broad and narrow line profiles are slightly different for CIV and
CIII].
  4. Our analysis suggests a different structure for the CIV and FeII+III
emitting regions, with the latter produced in the inner part of the BLR or in a
less extended emitting region than CIV.

evolution of closed dynamical systems and thermodynamics of interacting quantum
lattice models (formulated in terms of Hubbard-Stratonovich dynamical systems).
The first part of the paper utilizes a geometric Hilbert-space-invariant
formulation of unitary time-evolution, where a quantum Hamiltonian is viewed as
a trajectory in an abstract Lie algebra, while the sought-after evolution
operator is a trajectory in a dynamic group, generated by the algebra via
exponentiation. The evolution operator is uniquely determined by the
time-dependent dual generators that satisfy a system of differential equations,
dubbed here dual Schrodinger-Bloch equations, which represent a viable
alternative to the conventional Schrodinger formulation. These dual
Schrodinger-Bloch equations are derived and analyzed on a number of specific
examples. It is shown that deterministic dynamics of a closed classical
dynamical system occurs as action of a symmetry group on a classical manifold
and is driven by the same dual generators as in the corresponding quantum
problem. This represents quantum-to-classical correspondence. In the second
part of the paper, we further extend the Lie algebraic approach to a wide class
of interacting many-particle lattice models. A generalized Hubbard-Stratonovich
transform is proposed and it is used to show that the thermodynamic partition
function of a generic many-body quantum lattice model can be expressed in terms
of traces of single-particle evolution operators governed by the dynamic
Hubbard-Stratonovich fields. Finally, we derive Hubbard-Stratonovich dynamical
systems for the Bose-Hubbard model and a quantum spin model and use the
Lie-algebraic approach to obtain new non-perturbative dual descriptions of
these theories.

method consists of locating the frame from which the magnitude of the

frame. We demonstrate the efficacy of this method when applied to waveforms
from numerical simulations. In the test case of an equal-mass nonspinning
binary, our method locates the direction of the orbital angular momentum to
within $(\Delta \theta, \Delta \phi) = (0.05^{\circ},0.2^{\circ})$. We then
apply the method to a $q = M_2/M_1 = 3$ binary that exhibits significant
precession. In general a spinning binary's orbital angular momentum
$\mathbf{L}$ is \emph{not} orthogonal to the orbital plane. Evidence that our
method locates the direction of $\mathbf{L}$ rather than the normal of the
orbital plane is provided by comparison with post-Newtonian (PN) results. Also,
we observe that it accurately reproduces similar higher-mode amplitudes to a
comparable non-spinning (and therefore non-precessing) binary, and that the
frequency of the $(\ell=2,|m|=2)$ modes is consistent with the ""total
frequency"" of the binary's motion. The simple form of the quadrupole-aligned
waveform will be useful in attempts to analytically model the
inspiral-merger-ringdown (IMR) signal of precessing binaries, and in

Galactic-scale dark-matter halos in simulations of structure formation in LCDM
cosmologies. Analytical estimates of the frequency and energy scales of stream
encounters indicate that these missing satellites should have a negligible
effect on hot debris structures, such as the tails from the Sagittarius dwarf
galaxy. However, long cold streams, such as the structure known as GD-1 or
those from the globular cluster Palomar 5 (Pal 5) are expected to suffer many
tens of direct impacts from missing satellites during their lifetimes.
Numerical experiments confirm that these impacts create gaps in the debris'
orbital energy distribution, which will evolve into degree- and sub-degree-
scale fluctuations in surface density over the age of the debris. Maps of Pal
5's own stream contain surface density fluctuations on these scales. The
presence and frequency of these inhomogeneities suggests the existence of a
population of missing satellites in numbers predicted in the standard LCDM
cosmologies.

jet-like correlation and the ridge. The jet-like correlation is narrow in both
azimuth and pseudorapidity and has properties consistent with vacuum
fragmentation, while the ridge is narrow in azimuth but broad in pseudorapidity
and roughly independent of pseudorapidity. The energy, system, and particle
composition of the jet-like correlation and the ridge are discussed. Data
indicate that the jet-like correlation is dominantly produced by vacuum
fragmentation. Attempts have been made to explain the production of the ridge
component as coming from recombination, momentum kicks, and QCD magnetic

multicomponent diffusion should be nonlinear if there exist non-diagonal terms.
The vast variety of nonlinear multicomponent diffusion equations should be
ordered and special tools are needed to provide the systematic construction of
the nonlinear diffusion equations for multicomponent mixtures with significant
interaction between components. We develop an approach to nonlinear
multicomponent diffusion based on the idea of the reaction mechanism borrowed
from chemical kinetics.
  Chemical kinetics gave rise to very seminal tools for the modeling of
processes. This is the stoichiometric algebra supplemented by the simple
kinetic law. The results of this invention are now applied in many areas of
science, from particle physics to sociology. In our work we extend the area of
applications onto nonlinear multicomponent diffusion.
  We demonstrate, how the mechanism based approach to multicomponent diffusion
can be included into the general thermodynamic framework, and prove the
corresponding dissipation inequalities. To satisfy thermodynamic restrictions,
the kinetic law of an elementary process cannot have an arbitrary form. For the
general kinetic law (the generalized Mass Action Law), additional conditions
are proved. The cell--jump formalism gives an intuitively clear representation
of the elementary transport processes and, at the same time, produces kinetic
finite elements, a tool for numerical simulation.

function of time, owing to the contribution of the nonresonant terms. In order
to obtain the average population, it is found that the average approximation
based on the perturbation approach can be applied to the low-frequency region.
For the extremely low frequency which is much smaller than the decoherence
rate, we develop noncoherence approximation by dividing the evolution into
discrete time steps during which the coherence is lost totally. These
approximations present comprehensive analytical descriptions of LZS
interference in most of parameter space of frequency and decoherence rate,
agreeing well with those of the numerical simulations and providing a simple

(b) the effects of correlations in peculiar velocities induced by large-scale

over-density. For all of these effects we present a case study of their impact
on the cosmology derived by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-II Supernova Survey
(SDSS-II SN Survey). Correcting supernova redshifts for the CMB dipole slightly
over-corrects nearby supernovae that share some of our local motion. We show
that while neglecting the CMB dipole would cause a shift in the derived
equation of state of Delta w ~ 0.04 (at fixed matter density) the additional
local-motion correction is currently negligible (Delta w<0.01). We use a
covariance-matrix approach to statistically account for correlated peculiar
velocities. This down-weights nearby supernovae and effectively acts as a
graduated version of the usual sharp low-redshift cut. Neglecting coherent
velocities in the current sample causes a systematic shift of ~2% in the
preferred value of w and will therefore have to be considered carefully when
future surveys aim for percent-level accuracy. Finally, we perform n-body
simulations to estimate the likely magnitude of any local density fluctuation
(monopole) and estimate the impact as a function of the low-redshift cutoff. We
see that for this aspect the low-z cutoff of z=0.02 is well-justified
theoretically, but that living in a putative local density fluctuation leaves
an indelible imprint on the magnitude-redshift relation.

The interaction between qubits and electromagnetic fields can provide
additional coupling channels to qubit states, leading to quantum interference
in a microwave driven qubit. In particular, the interwell relaxation or Rabi
oscillation, resulting respectively from the multi- or single-mode interaction,
can induce effective crossovers. The environment is modeled by a multi-mode
thermal bath, generating the interwell relaxation. Relaxation induced
interference, independent of the tunnel coupling, provides deeper understanding
to the interaction between the qubits and their environment. It also supplies a
useful tool to characterize the relaxation strength as well as the
characteristic frequency of the bath. In addition, we demonstrate the
relaxation can generate population inversion in a strongly driving two-level
system. On the other hand, different from Rabi oscillation, Rabi oscillation
induced interference involves more complicated and modulated photon exchange
thus offers an alternative means to manipulate the qubit, with more
controllable parameters including the strength and position of the tunnel
coupling. It also provides a testing ground for exploring nonlinear quantum
phenomena and quantum state manipulation, in not only the flux qubit but also
the systems with no crossover structure, e.g. phase qubits.

$E_T=E_u\Lambda^2$. Calculations give $E_u=-0.108$ for the ground state and
$E_u=-1.\times10^{-4}$ for the single Efimov state found. The cut-off
divergence is remedied by modifying the off-shell t-matrix by replacing the
rank-1 by a rank-2 phase-shift equivalent potential. This is somewhat similar
to the counterterm method suggested by Bedaque et al. This investigation is
exploratory and does not refer to any specific physical system.

from both extragalactic sources and pulsars. By developing independent models
for the magnetic field in the outer and inner Galaxy, we conclude that in the
inner Galaxy, the magnetic field closely follows the spiral arms, while in the
outer Galaxy, the field is consistent with being purely azimuthal.Furthermore,
the models contain no reversals in the outer Galaxy, and together seem to
suggest the existence of a single reversed region that spirals out from the

actuality of such new hydrodynamics becomes very clear for the last development
in chemical synthesis of different kind of aerogels with nanopore structure as
well as numerous studies of nanoporous substances. One of the interesting
obtained results that density waves (the first sound) and temperature waves
(the second sound) become strong coupled even in the absence of viscosity, so
it is purely geometric effect of fractal space of nanopores. In the present
report we will review the procedure, results and discuss the issues for this

Methods. We used the combined high spectral and spatial resolution covered by
the VLTI/AMBER instrument. Thanks to a new multiwavelength optical/IR
interferometry imaging technique, we reconstructed the first velocity-resolved
images with a milliarcsecond resolution in the infrared domain. Results. We
managed to disentangle the dust and gas emission in the HD 62623 circumstellar
disc.We measured the dusty disc inner inner rim, i.e. 6 mas, constrained the
inclination angle and the position angle of the major-axis of the disc.We also
measured the inner gaseous disc extension (2 mas) and probed its velocity field
thanks to AMBER high spectral resolution. We find that the expansion velocity
is negligible, and that Keplerian rotation is a favoured velocity field. Such a
velocity field is unexpected if fast rotation of the central star alone is the
main mechanism of matter ejection. Conclusions. As the star itself seems to
rotate below its breakup-up velocity, rotation cannot explain the formation of
the dense equatorial disc. Moreover, as the expansion velocity is negligible,
radiatively driven wind is also not a suitable explanation to explain the disc
formation. Consequently, the most probable hypothesis is that the accumulation
of matter in the equatorial plane is due to the presence of the spectroscopic
low mass companion.

current driven by a magnetic field gradient is finite even in the absence of

collision-dominated value in the disorder-free limit, providing a direct
measure for the inverse strength of electron-electron interactions. In neutral
graphene, with Fermi energy at the Dirac point, the Coulomb interactions remain
unusually strong, such that the inelastic scattering rate comes close to a
conjectured upper bound 1/\tau_{inel} <= k_B T/\hbar, similarly as in strongly
coupled quantum critical systems. The strong scattering is reflected by a
minimum of the spin conductivity at the Dirac point, where it reaches sigma_s =
(0.121/alpha^2) * (mu_B^2/\hbar) at weak Coulomb coupling alpha. Up to the
replacement of quantum units, e^2/\hbar -> mu_s^2/\hbar, this result equals the
collision-dominated electrical conductivity obtained previously. This
accidental symmetry is, however, broken to higher orders in the interaction
strength. For gated graphene, and 2d metals in general, we show that the
transport time is parametrically smaller than the collision time. We exploit
this to compute the collision-limited sigma_s analytically as sigma_s= (1/C) *

which naturally incorporates the exact space boundary conditions. The idea is
to write the distribution fonction $f$ in all its domain as the sum of a
Maxwellian adapted to the boundary (which is not the usual Maxwellian
associated with $f$) and a reminder kinetic part. This Maxwellian is defined
such that its 'incoming' velocity moments coincide with the 'incoming' velocity
moments of the distribution function. Important consequences of this strategy
are the following. i) No artificial boundary condition is needed in the
micro/macro models and the exact boundary condition on $f$ is naturally
transposed to the macro part of the model. ii) It provides a new class of the
so-called 'Asymptotic preserving' (AP) numerical schemes: such schemes are
consistent with the original kinetic equation for all fixed positive value of
the Knudsen number $\eps$, and if $\eps \to 0 $ with fixed numerical parameters
then these schemes degenerate into consistent numerical schemes for the various
corresponding asymptotic fluid or diffusive models. Here, the strategy provides
AP schemes not only inside the physical domain but also in the space boundary
layers. We provide a numerical test in the case of a diffusion limit of the
one-group transport equation, and show that our AP scheme recovers the boundary
layer and a good approximation of the theoretical boundary value, which is
usually computed from to the so-called Chandrasekhar function.

bright G8V star (V=11.6) with a metallicity close to solar

activity, both from emission in the cores of the CaII H and K lines and
photometric variability with a period of 18.4d and an amplitude of about 1%. We
use a new method to show quantitatively that this periodic signal has a low

requires precise predictions for the weak lensing measures. In this paper we
present a weak lensing prediction code based on the Coyote Universe emulator.
The Coyote Universe emulator predicts the (non-linear) power spectrum of
density fluctuations (P_delta) to high accuracy for k \in [0.002;3.4] h/Mpc
within the redshift interval z \in [0;1], outside this regime we extend P_delta
using a modified Halofit code. This pipeline is used to calculate various
second-order cosmic shear statistics, e.g., shear power spectrum, shear-shear
correlation function, ring statistics and COSEBIs (Complete Orthogonal Set of
EB-mode Integrals), and we examine how the upper limit in k (and z) to which
P_delta is known, impacts on these statistics. For example, we find that
k_max~8 h/Mpc causes a bias in the shear power spectrum at l~4000 that is
comparable to the statistical errors (intrinsic shape-noise and cosmic
variance) of a DES-like survey, whereas for LSST-like errors k_max~15 h/Mpc is
needed to limit the bias at l~4000. For the most recently developed
second-order shear statistics, the COSEBIs, we find that 9 modes can be
calculated accurately knowing P_delta to k_max=10 h/Mpc. The COSEBIs allow for
an EB-mode decomposition using a shear-shear correlation function measured over
a finite range, thereby avoiding any EB-mode mixing due to finite survey size.
We perform a detailed study in a 5-dimensional parameter space in order to
examine whether all cosmological information is captured by these 9 modes with
the result that already 7-8 modes are sufficient.

applied to the Fourier phases of the original data, which allows to test for
the presence of higher order correlations (HOCs) on well-defined scales. Using
scaling indices as test statistics we find highly significant signatures for
non-Gaussianities when considering all scales. We test for NGs in the bands l =
[2,20], l = [20,60], l = [60,120] and l = [120,300]. We find highly significant
signatures for non-Gaussianities and ecliptic hemispherical asymmetries for l =
[2, 20]. We also obtain highly significant deviations from Gaussianity for the
band l = [120,300]. The result for the full l-range can be interpreted as a
superposition of the signatures found in the bands l = [2, 20] and l = [120,
300]. We find remarkably similar results when analyzing different ILC-like
maps. We perform a set of tests to investigate if the detected anomalies can be
explained by systematics. While no test can convincingly rule out the intrinsic
nature of the anomalies for the low l case, the ILC map making procedure and/or
residual noise in the maps can also lead to NGs at small scales. Our
investigations prove that there are phase correlations in the WMAP data of the
CMB. In the absence of an explanation in terms of Galactic foregrounds or known
systematic artefacts, the signatures at low l must so far be taken to be
cosmological at high significance. These findings strongly disagree with
predictions of isotropic cosmologies with single field slow roll inflation. The
task is now to elucidate the origin of the phase correlations and to understand
the physical processes leading to these scale-dependent non-Gaussianities - if
systematics as cause for them must be ruled out.

the need for post-shipping code rewrites as well as changes to the end-host

adherence is proved by comparing the transitions of an inlined monitor with
those of a trusted ""ghost"" monitor represented using JML-style annotations. At
time of receiving a program with proof annotations, it is sufficient for the
receiver to plug in its own trusted ghost monitor and check the resulting
verification conditions, to verify that inlining has been performed correctly,
of the correct policy. We have proved correctness of the approach at the Java

Two-dimensional maps of stellar populations (star formation histories, chemical
elements); (b) The distribution of the excitation mechanism and element
abundances of the ionized gas; and (c) Kinematic properties (velocity fields,
velocity dispersion), both from emission and from absorption lines. To cover
the full optical extension of the target galaxies (i.e. out to a 3sigma depth
of ~23 mag/arcsec2), CALIFA uses the exceptionally large field of view of the
PPAK/PMAS IFU at the 3.5m telescope of the Calar Alto observatory. We use two
grating setups, one covering the wavelength range between 3700 and 5000 AA at a
spectral resolution R~1650, and the other covering 4300 to 7000 AA at R~850.
The survey was allocated 210 dark nights, distributed in 6 semesters and
starting in July 2010 and is carried out by the CALIFA collaboration,
comprising ~70 astronomers from 8 different countries. As a legacy survey, the
fully reduced data will be made publically available, once their quality has
been verified. We showcase here early results obtained from the data taken so

bandit problem that is defined as follows. There is a given bipartite graph of
$M$ users and $N \geq M$ resources. For each user-resource pair $(i,j)$, there
is an associated state that evolves as an aperiodic irreducible finite-state
Markov chain with unknown parameters, with transitions occurring each time the
particular user $i$ is allocated resource $j$. The user $i$ receives a reward
that depends on the corresponding state each time it is allocated the resource
$j$. The system objective is to learn the best matching of users to resources
so that the long-term sum of the rewards received by all users is maximized.
This corresponds to minimizing regret, defined here as the gap between the
expected total reward that can be obtained by the best-possible static matching
and the expected total reward that can be achieved by a given algorithm. We
present a polynomial-storage and polynomial-complexity-per-step
matching-learning algorithm for this problem. We show that this algorithm can
achieve a regret that is uniformly arbitrarily close to logarithmic in time and
polynomial in the number of users and resources. This formulation is broadly
applicable to scheduling and switching problems in networks and significantly
extends prior results in the area.

divide the events into two groups by their data quality. One (gold data set)
consists of GRBs with peak energies determined by the Band model with four free
parameters. On the other hand, GRBs in the other group (bronze data set) have
relatively poor energy spectra so that their peak energies were determined by
the Band model with fixed spectral index (i.e. three free parameters) or by the
Cut-off power law (CPL) model with three free parameters. Using only the gold
data set we found the intrinsic dispersion in $\log L_p$ ($=\sigma_{\rm int}$)
is 0.13 and 0.22 for \tsutsui correlation ($T_L \equiv E_{\rm iso}/L_p$) and
\yonetoku correlation, respectively. We also find that GRBs in the bronze data
set have systematically larger $E_p$ than expected by the correlations
constructed with the gold data set. This means that the intrinsic dispersion of
correlations among $E_p$, $L_p$, and \Eiso of GRBs depends on the quality of

be able to determine the luminosity distance with $\sim 16%$ error, which might

disjoint bi-cliques on a set of nodes while minimizing the symmetric difference
to a bipartite input graph. The number or size of the output clusters is not
constrained in any way. The best known approximation algorithm for this problem
gives a factor of 11. This result and all previous ones involve solving large
linear or semi-definite programs which become prohibitive even for modestly
sized tasks. In this paper we present an improved factor 4 approximation
algorithm to this problem using a simple combinatorial algorithm which does not
require solving large convex programs. The analysis extends a method developed
by Ailon, Charikar and Alantha in 2008, where a randomized pivoting algorithm
was analyzed for obtaining a 3-approximation algorithm for Correlation
Clustering, which is the same problem on graphs (not bipartite). The analysis
for Correlation Clustering there required defining events for structures
containing 3 vertices and using the probability of these events to produce a
feasible solution to a dual of a certain natural LP bounding the optimal cost.
It is tempting here to use sets of 4 vertices, which are the smallest
structures for which contradictions arise for Bipartite Correlation Clustering.
This simple idea, however, appears to be evasive. We show that, by modifying
the LP, we can analyze algorithms which take into consideration subgraph
structures of unbounded size. We believe our techniques are interesting in
their own right, and may be used for other problems as well.

matrix-valued Higgs fields. Here we focus on Yang--Mills theory with gauge
group $\SU{N}/\ZZ_N$ and a special reduction which yields only one non-abelian
Higgs field. One of the new features of this reduction is the fact that while
the instanton number of the theory in four dimensions is generally fractional
with denominator $N$, we still obtain an integral vortex number in the reduced
theory. We clarify the relation between these two topological charges at a
bundle geometric level. Another striking feature is the emergence of
non-trivial lower and upper bounds for the energy of the reduced theory on
$\Sigma$. These bounds are proportional to the area of $\Sigma$. We give
special solutions of the theory on $\Sigma$ by embedding solutions of the
abelian Higgs model into the non-abelian theory, and we relate our work to the
language of quiver bundles, which has recently proved fruitful in the study of
dimensional reduction of Yang--Mills theory.

Liner/Seyfert 1 galaxy M81, from optical spectra obtained with the GMOS
integral field spectrograph on the Gemini North telescope at a spatial
resolution of 10pc. The stellar velocity field shows circular rotation but
deviations are observed close to the minor axis which can be attributed to
stellar motions possibly associated to a nuclear bar. The stellar velocity
dispersion of the bulge is 162km/s leading to a black hole mass of
M_BH=5.5x10^7M_sun based on the M_BH-sigma relationship. The gas kinematics is
dominated by non-circular motions and the subtraction of the stellar velocity
field reveals blueshifts of ~-100km/s on the far side of the galaxy and a few
redshifts on the near side. These characteristics can be interpreted in terms
of streaming towards the center if the gas is in the plane. On the basis of the
observed velocities and geometry of the flow, we estimate a mass inflow rate in
ionized gas of ~4.0x10^-3M_sun/year, which is of the order of the accretion
rate necessary to power the LINER nucleus of M81. We have also applied the
technique of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to our data, which reveals the
presence of a rotating nuclear gas disk within ~50pc from the nucleus and a
compact outflow, approximately perpendicular to the disk. The PCA combined with
the observed gas velocity field shows that the nuclear disk is being fed by gas
circulating in the galaxy plane. The presence of the outflow is supported by a
compact jet seen in radio observations at a similar orientation, as well as by
an enhancement of the [OI]\Halpha line ratio, probably resulting from shock
excitation of the circumnuclear gas by the radio jet. With these observations
we are thus resolving both the feeding -- via the nuclear disk and observed gas
inflow, and the feedback -- via the outflow, around the nucleus of M81.

of the model, verifying on-line a set of properties reusing the same compiled

  Symbolic Model Checking algorithms work by manipulating sets of states, and
these sets are often represented by BDDs. It has been observed that the size of
BDDs may grow exponentially as the model and formula increase in size. As a

is embedded in a general 3-manifold, the problems of finding these surfaces
were shown to be NP-complete and NP-hard respectively. However, there is
evidence that the special case when the ambient manifold is R^3, or more
generally when the second homology is trivial, should be considerably more

smallest norm chain with a given boundary. While the decision variant of OBCP
is NP-complete in general, we give conditions under which it can be solved in

Their location in the X-ray luminosity vs temperature plane, with an X-ray

relativistic bremsstrahlung under gravitational scattering. Our approach is a
version of the fast motion approximation scheme, the main novelty being the use
of the momentum space representation. Using it we calculate in a closed form
the spectrum of scalar, electromagnetic and gravitational radiation. Our
results for the total emitted energy agree with those by Thorne and Kovacs. We
also explain why the method of equivalent gravitons fails to produce the
correct result for the spectral-angular distribution of emitted radiation under
gravitational scattering, contrary to the case of Weizs\""acker-Williams
approximation in quantum electrodynamics.

Gibbs's microcanonical and grand canonical formulations of statistical

and entropy density distributions are obtained, which are found to be in
agreement with the well known results of the relativistic formulation of
Boltzmann's kinetic theory. Explicit expressions for the total entropy, total
energy and rest mass of the gas are obtained. The position of the center of
mass of the gas in equilibrium is found. The non-relativistic and
ultrarelativistic approximations are also considered. The phase space volume of
the system is calculated explicitly in the ultrarelativistic approximation.

be indistinguishable at nanoscale levels. Living cells are quantum ""devices""
rather than simple electronic devices utilizing only the charge of conduction
electrons. In our opinion, due to their unusual biophysical properties, special
biomagnetites must have a biological function in living cells in general and in
the brain in particular. In this paper we advance a hypothesis that while
biomagnetites are developed jointly with organic molecules and cellular
electromagnetic fields in cells, they can record information about the Earth's
magnetic vector potential of the entire flight in migratory birds.

appearing on many mobile devices. Unlike liquid crystal displays (LCD), OLED
displays consume dramatically different power for showing different colors. In
particular, OLED displays are inefficient for showing bright colors. This has
made them undesirable for mobile devices because much of the web content is of
bright colors.
  To tackle this problem, we present the motivational studies, design, and
realization of Chameleon, a color adaptive web browser that renders web pages
with power-optimized color schemes under user-supplied constraints. Driven by
the findings from our motivational studies, Chameleon provides end users with
important options, offloads tasks that are not absolutely needed in real-time,
and accomplishes real-time tasks by carefully enhancing the codebase of a
browser engine. According to measure-ments with OLED smartphones, Chameleon is
able to re-duce average system power consumption for web browsing by 41% and
reduce display power consumption by 64% without introducing any noticeable
delay.

soft gamma-ray energy bands, which may offer an advantage over coded aperture
imaging at high energies. A rotating modulator (RM) consists of a single mask
of co-planar parallel slats typically spaced equidistance apart, suspended
above an array of circular non-imaging detectors. The mask rotates, temporally
modulating the transmitted image of the object scene. The measured count rate
profiles of each detector are folded modulo the mask rotational period, and the
object scene is reconstructed using pre-determined characteristic modulation
profiles. The use of Monte Carlo simulation to derive the characteristic count
rate profiles is accurate but computationally expensive; an analytic approach
is preferred for its speed of computation. We present both the standard and a
new advanced characteristic formula describing the modulation pattern of the
RM; the latter is a more robust description of the instrument response
developed as part of the design of a wide-field high-resolution telescope for
gamma-ray astronomy. We examine an approximation to the advanced formula to
simplify reconstruction software and increase computational speed, and comment
on both the inherent limitations and usefulness of the approach. Finally, we
show comparisons to the standard formula and demonstrate image reconstructions
from Monte Carlo simulations.
