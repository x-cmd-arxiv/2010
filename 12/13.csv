verification. Logic formulas with user-defined recursive functions are used to
specify properties on the program states before/after program executions.
  Three basic functions are introduced to represents memory access,
record-field access and array-element access. Some axioms are introduced to
specify these basic functions in our logic.
  The concept Memory Scope Function (MSF) is introduced in our logic. Given a
recursive function $f$, the MSF of $f$ computes the set of memory units
accessed during the evaluation of $f$. A set of rules are given to derive the
definition of this MSF syntactically from the definition of $f$. As MSFs are
also recursive functions, they also have their MSFs. An axiom is given to
specify that an MSF contains its MSF. Based on this axiom, local reasoning is
supported with predicate variables.
  Pre-state terms are used to specify the relations between pre-states and
post-states. People can use pre-state terms in post-conditions to represents
the values on the pre-state.
  The axiom of assignment statements in Hoare's logic is modified to deal with
pointers. The basic idea is that during the program execution, a recursive
function is evaluated to the same value as long as no memory unit in its memory
scope is modified. Another proof rule is added for memory allocation
statements.
  We use a simple example to show that our logic can deal with pointer programs
in this paper. In the appendix, the Shorre-Waite algorithm is proved using our
logic. We also use the selection-sort program to show that our logic can be
used to prove program with indirectly-specified components.

supergravity on skew-whiffed AdS_4 X S^7 background which results in two scalar
modes with m^2=-2 on AdS_4. Being conformally coupled with a quartic
interaction it is possible to find the exact solutions of the scalar equation
on this background. These modes turn out to be invariant under SU(4) subgroup
of SO(8) isometry group, whereas there are no corresponding SU(4) singlet BPS
operators of dimensions one or two on the boundary ABJM theory. Noticing the
interchange of 8_s and 8_c representations under skew-whiffing in the bulk, we
propose the theory of anti-membranes should similarly be obtained from ABJM
theory by swapping these representations. In particular, this enables us to
identify the dual boundary operators of the two scalar modes. We deform the
boundary theory by the dual operators and examine the fermionic field equations
and compare the solutions of the deformed theory with those of the bulk.

(MDI) on-board the SoHO mission provide long time series of filtergrams that
are ideal for studying the evolution of large-scale phenomena in the solar
atmosphere and their dependence on solar activity. These filtergrams, however,
are not taken in a pure continuum spectral band, but are constructed from a
proxy, namely a combination of filtergrams sampling the Ni I 676.8 nm line. We
studied the sensitivity of this continuum proxy to the shape of the nickel line
and to the degradation in the instrumental transmission profiles. We compared
continuum intensity measurements in the nearby of nickel line with MDI proxy
values in three sets of high resolution spectro-polarimetric data obtained with
the Interferometric Bidimensional Spectrometer (IBIS), and in synthetic data,
obtained from multi-dimensional simulations of magneto-convection and
one-dimensional atmosphere models. We found that MDI continuum measurements
require brightness corrections which depend on magnetic field strength,
temperature and, to a smaller extent, plasma velocity. The correction ranges
from 2% to 25% in sunspots, and is, on average, less than 2% for other
features. The brightness correction also varies with position on the disk, with
larger variations obtained for sunspots, and smaller variations obtained for
quiet sun, faculae and micropores. Correction factors derived from observations
agree with those deduced from the numerical simulations when observational
effects are taken into account. Finally, we found that the investigated
potential uncertainties in the transmission characteristics of MDI filters only
slightly affect the brightness correction to proxy measurements.

halos is increased by roughly an order of magnitude, from 2 10^4 Msun to about
2 10^5 Msun; (ii) this characteristic mass has a large scatter (full width at

different approaches when the base of the family is a regular, 1-dimensional

for the line bundle locus in a family of compact moduli spaces of pure sheaves

expected to be a very important one, connected directly or indirectly to a
variety of observational phenomena in cool stars---such as rotation, activity,
magnetic field generation and topology, timescales for evolution of these, and
even the basic mass-radius relationship. In this Cool Stars XVI Splinter
Session, we aimed to use the M4 transition as an opportunity for discussion
about the interiors of low-mass stars and the mechanisms which determine their
fundamental properties. By the conclusion of the session, several key points
were elucidated. Although M dwarfs exhibit significant changes across the fully
convective boundary, this ""M4 transition"" is not observationally sharp or
discrete. Instead, the properties of M dwarfs (i.e. radius, effective
temperature, rotation, activity lifetime, magnetic field strength and topology)
show smooth changes across M3--M6 spectral types. In addition, a wide range of
stellar masses share similar spectral types around the fully convective
transition. There appears to be a second transition at M6--M8 spectral types,
below which there exists a clear dichotomy of magnetic field topologies.
Finally, we used the information and ideas presented in the session to
construct a framework for how the structure of an M dwarf star, born with
specific mass and chemical composition, responds to the presence of its
magnetic field, itself driven by a feedback process that links the star's
rotation, interior structure, and field topology.

(with non-ultra local Poisson structures) the bridge between these two

these two techniques on the example of the SU(2) principal chiral field model

the tracking object via $\ell_1$ norm minimization \cite{Xue_ICCV_09_Track}.
However, the high computational complexity involved in the $ \ell_1 $ tracker
restricts its further applications in real time processing scenario. Hence we
propose a Real Time Compressed Sensing Tracking (RTCST) by exploiting the
signal recovery power of Compressed Sensing (CS). Dimensionality reduction and
a customized Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithm are adopted to
accelerate the CS tracking. As a result, our algorithm achieves a real-time
speed that is up to $6,000$ times faster than that of the $\ell_1$ tracker.
Meanwhile, RTCST still produces competitive (sometimes even superior) tracking
accuracy comparing to the existing $\ell_1$ tracker. Furthermore, for a
stationary camera, a further refined tracker is designed by integrating a
CS-based background model (CSBM). This CSBM-equipped tracker coined as RTCST-B,
outperforms most state-of-the-arts with respect to both accuracy and
robustness. Finally, our experimental results on various video sequences, which
are verified by a new metric---Tracking Success Probability (TSP), show the
excellence of the proposed algorithms.

less reasonable than IR. In this paper, we introduce inverse category frequency
(icf) into term weighting scheme and propose two novel approaches, i.e., tf.icf
and icf-based supervised term weighting schemes. The tf.icf adopts icf to
substitute idf factor and favors terms occurring in fewer categories, rather
than fewer documents. And the icf-based approach combines icf and relevance
frequency (rf) to weight terms in a supervised way. Our cross-classifier and
cross-corpus experiments have shown that our proposed approaches are superior
or comparable to six supervised term weighting schemes and three traditional
schemes in terms of macro-F1 and micro-F1.

steady-state distribution of node occupancies by decoupling the chain to
smaller queueing blocks. These approximate solutions are used to understand the
effect of buffer sizes on throughput capacity and the distribution of packet

throughput capacity is unaltered in the absence of hop-by-hop feedback provided
packet-level network coding is allowed. Finally, using simulations, it is
confirmed that the proposed framework yields accurate estimates of the

successfully describes electromagnetism, weak and strong interactions in the

interest since they appear as gauge symmetries of new superconformal
Chern-Simons non-Abelian theories in 2 + 1 dimensions with the maximum allowed
number of N = 8 linear supersymmetries. These theories explore the low energy
dynamics of the microscopic degrees of freedom of coincident M2 branes and
constitute the boundary conformal field theories of the bulk AdS4 / S7 exact
11-dimensional supergravity backgrounds of supermembranes. These mysterious new
symmetries, the Filippov-Nambu 3-algebras represent the implementation of
non-associative algebras of coordinates of charged tensionless strings, the
boundaries of open M2 branes in antisymmetric field magnetic backgrounds of M5
branes in the M2 -M5 system. A crucial input into this construction came from
the study of the M2-M5 system in the Basu- Harvey's work where an equation
describing the Bogomol'nyi-Prasad- Sommerfeld (BPS) bound state of multiple
M2-branes ending on an M5 was formulated. The Filippov-Nambu 3-algebras are
either operator or matrix representation of the classical Nambu symmetries of
world volume preserving diffeomorphisms of M2 branes. Indeed at the classical
level the supermembrane Lagrangian, in the covariant formulation, has the world
volume preserving diffeomorphisms symmetry SDiff(M2+1). The Filippov-Nambu
3-algebras presumably correspond to the quantization of the rigid motions in
this infinite dimensional group, which describe the low energy excitation
spectrum of the M2 branes. It emphasizes the Filippov-Nambu n-algebras as the
mathematical framework for describing symmetry properties of classical and
quantum mechanical systems.

early-type galaxies. We find that most GC systems possess an obvious negative
gradient in g-z color (bluer outwards). For GC systems displaying color
bimodality, both metal-rich and metal-poor GC subpopulations present shallower
but significant color gradients on average, and the mean gradients of these two
subpopulations are of roughly equal strength. The FOV of ACS mainly restricts
us to measuring the inner gradients of GC systems. These gradients, however,
can introduce an aperture bias when measuring the mean colors of GC
subpopulations from relatively narrow central pointings. Inferred corrections
to previous work imply a reduced significance for the relation between the mean
color of metal-poor GCs and their host galaxy luminosity. The GC color
gradients also show a dependence with host galaxy mass where the gradiens are
weakest at the ends of the mass spectrum--in massive galaxies and dwarf
galaxies--and strongest in galaxies of intermediate mass, around a stellar mass
of M_stellar~10^10M_sun. We also measure color gradients for field stars in the
host galaxies. We find that GC color gradients are systematically steeper than
field star color gradients, but the shape of the gradient-mass relation is the
same for both. If gradients are caused by rapid dissipational collapse and
weakened by merging, these color gradients support a picture where the inner GC
systems of most intermediate-mass and massive galaxies formed early and rapidly
with the most massive galaxies having experienced greater merging. The lack of
strong gradients in the GC systems of dwarfs, which probably have not
experienced many recent major mergers, suggests that low mass halos were
inefficient at retaining and mixing metals during the epoch of GC formation.

whose shift symmetry is explicitly broken only by physics localized on branes.
Reliable calculation of their low-energy potential is often difficult because
it requires details of the stabilization of the extra dimensions. In rugby ball
solutions, for which two compact extra dimensions are stabilized in the
presence of only positive-tension brane sources, the effects of brane
back-reaction can be computed explicitly. This allows the calculation of the
shape of the low-energy pGB potential and response of the extra dimensional
geometry as a function of the perturbing brane properties. If the
pGB-dependence is a small part of the total brane tension a very general
analysis is possible, permitting an exploration of how the system responds to
frustration when the two branes disagree on what the proper scalar vacuum
should be. We show how the low-energy potential is given by the sum of brane
tensions (in agreement with common lore) when only the brane tensions couple to
the pGB. We also show how a direct brane coupling to the flux stabilizing the
extra dimensions corrects this result in a way that does not simply amount to
the contribution of the flux to the brane tensions. We calculate the mass of
the would-be zero mode, and briefly describe several potential applications,
including a brane realization of `natural inflation,' and a dynamical mechanism
for suppressing the couplings of the pGB to matter localized on the branes.
Since the scalar can be light enough to be relevant to precision tests of
gravity (in a technically natural way) this mechanism can be relevant to
evading phenomenological bounds.

increases with antigen affinity, a process known as affinity discrimination. We
use computational modeling to show that B cell affinity discrimination requires
that kinetic proofreading predominate over serial engagement. We find that if
BCR molecules become signaling-capable immediately upon binding antigen, the
loss in serial engagement as affinity increases results in weaker signaling
with increasing affinity. A threshold time for antigen to stay bound to BCR for
several seconds before the latter becomes signaling-capable, similar to kinetic
proofreading, is needed to overcome the loss in serial engagement due to
increasing antigen affinity, and replicate the monotonic increase in B cell
signaling with affinity observed in B cell activation experiments. This finding
matches well with the experimentally observed time (~ 20 seconds) required for
the BCR signaling domains to undergo antigen and lipid raft-mediated
conformational changes that lead to Src-family kinase recruitment. We
hypothesize that the physical basis of the threshold time of antigen binding
may lie in the formation timescale of BCR dimers. The latter decreases with
increasing affinity, resulting in shorter threshold antigen binding times as
affinity increases. Such an affinity-dependent kinetic proofreading requirement
results in affinity discrimination very similar to that observed in biological
experiments. B cell affinity discrimination is critical to the process of
affinity maturation and the production of high affinity antibodies, and thus
our results here have important implications in applications such as vaccine
design.

of gravity can be parameterized by the effective equation of state (EOS)
$\omega$ for the expansion history of the Universe. A useful model independent
approach to the EOS of them can be given by so-called
Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization where two parameters of it
($\omega_{0}$ and $\omega_{a}$) can be constrained by the geometrical
observations which suffer from degeneracies between models. The linear growth
of large scale structure is usually used to remove these degeneracies. This
growth can be described by the growth index parameter $\gamma$ and it can be
parameterized by $\gamma_{0} + \gamma_{a} (1 - a)$ in general. We use the
scalar-tensor theories of gravity (STG) and show that the discernment between
models is possible only when $\gamma_a$ is not negligible. We show that the
linear density perturbation of the matter component as a function of redshift
severely constrains the viable subclasses of STG in terms of $\omega$ and
$\gamma$. From this method, we can rule out or prove the viable STG in future
observations. When we use $Z(\phi) =1$, $F$ shows the convex shape of evolution
in a viable STG model. The viable STG models with $Z(\phi) = 1$ are not
distinguishable from dark energy models when we strongly limit the solar system
constraint.

the new spectrograph X-shooter mounted on the UT2@VLT. The target (2MASS
J053825.4-024241) is a 0.06 Msun object in the star-formation region sigma
Orionis. The X-shooter spectrum covers simultaneously the whole range from UV
to NIR (300-2500 nm). The J053825.4-024241 spectrum is rich in emission lines
that are typical of accreting young object and clearly shows the Balmer jump.
Moreover, many photospheric atomic and molecular absorption lines yield the
spectral type and confirm that the object is young. We compute the mass
accretion rate from all available observed accretion diagnostics. We find that
there is a large spread in the Macc values (up to a factor 40) that is not
caused by variability; some of this spread may be intrinsic, i.e., owing to
different physical conditions of the emitting region for the same Macc.
However, within the large error bars all Macc measurements agree, and the mean
value is logMacc ~ -9.86 +- 0.45 Myr. The hydrogen Balmer lines are clearly
detected up to n=25. Their ratios suggest that the emitting region is cold
(T~2000-3000 K), dense and in thermal equilibrium (LTE), and that the lines are
optically thick up to n~21. We briefly discuss the implications of this result
for magnetospheric accretion models.

there exists a whole family of flat-sky approximations of similar accuracy for
which the expression and amplitude of next to leading order terms can be
explicitly computed. It is noted that in this context two limiting cases can be
encountered for which the expressions can be further simplified. They
correspond to cases where either the sources are localized in a narrow region
(thin-shell approximation) or are slowly varying over a large distance (which
leads to the so-called Limber approximation). Applying this to the calculation
of the spectra it is shown that, as long as the late integrated Sachs-Wolfe
contribution is neglected, the flat-sky approximation at leading order is
accurate at 1% level for any multipole. Generalization of this construction
scheme to the bispectra led to the introduction of an alternative description
of the bispectra for which the flat-sky approximation is well controlled. This
is not the case for the usual description of the bispectrum in terms of reduced
bispectrum for which a flat-sky approximation is proposed but the
next-to-leading order terms of which remain obscure.

between the quark chemical potential, which enhances the quark number
susceptibility, and the quark mass that suppresses the susceptibility. We
observe that depending on the relative values of the quark mass and the quark
chemical potential, the quark number susceptibility shows a diverging or
converging behavior. We also calculate the chiral susceptibility in D3/D7 model
to support the observation made with the quark number susceptibility.

manipulators that may appear on their singular surfaces in the joint space.
Cusp points play an important role in the kinematic behavior of parallel
manipulators since they make possible a non-singular change of assembly mode.
In previous works, the cusp points were calculated in sections of the joint
space by solving a 24th-degree polynomial without any proof that this
polynomial was the only one that gives all solutions. The purpose of this study
is to propose a rigorous methodology to determine the cusp points of
3-R\underline{P}R manipulators and to certify that all cusp points are found.

to accurately describe a large range of materials, such as solids with constant
quality factors. The evolution equations satisfied by the velocity, the stress,
and the memory variables are written in the form of a first-order system of
PDEs with a source term. This system is solved by splitting it into two parts:
the propagative part is discretized explicitly, using a fourth-order ADER
scheme on a Cartesian grid, and the diffusive part is then solved exactly. Jump
conditions along the interfaces are discretized by applying an immersed
interface method. Numerical experiments of wave propagation in viscoelastic and
fluid media show the efficiency of this numerical modeling for dealing with
challenging problems, such as multiple scattering configurations.

most of the angular momentum transport in accretion discs. However, molecular
dissipation processes may drastically change the efficiency of MRI turbulence
in realistic astrophysical situations. The physical origin of this dependency
is still poorly understood as linear and quasi linear theories fail to explain
it. In this paper, we look for the link between molecular dissipation processes
and MRI transport of angular momentum in non stratified shearing box
simulations including a mean vertical field. We show that magnetic helicity is
unimportant in the model we consider. We perform a spectral analysis on the
simulations tracking energy exchanges in spectral space when turbulence is
fully developed. We find that the energy exchanges are essentially direct (from
large to small scale) whereas some non linear interactions appear to be non
local in spectral space. We speculate that these non local interactions are
responsible for the correlation between turbulent transport and molecular
dissipation. We argue that this correlation should then disappear when a
significant scale separation is achieved and we discuss several methods by
which one can test this hypothesis.

overview of the recent work on multiple M2-branes focusing on the
Bagger-Lambert theory and its relation to the Nambu-Poisson M5-brane and the

explicitly calculated and the charges interpreted in terms of spacetime

We begin with a review of the dNS duality transformation which allows a gauge
field to be dualised to a scalar field in 2+1 dimensions. Applying this duality
to the $\alpha'^2$ terms of the D2-brane supersymmetry transformations we are
able to determine the $l_p^3$ corrections to the supersymmetry transformations

similar to previous estimates. We also explore the possibility of a large g_NL
as the reason for the observed excess of the massive galaxy clusters. This
scenario, g_NL>2*10^6, appears to be in more agreement with CMB and LSS limits
for the non-Gaussianity parameters and could also provide an explanation for
the overabundance of large voids in the early universe.

combined with a physical principle based dominant factor. The characteristic
line intensity of the specific element was taken to build up the dominant
factor to reflect the major elemental concentration and partial least squares
(PLS) approach was then applied to further improve the model accuracy. The
deviation evolution of characteristic line intensity from the ideal condition
was depicted and according to the deviation understanding, efforts were taken
to model the non-linear self-absorption and inter-element interference effects
to improve the accuracy of dominant factor model. With a dominant factor to
carry the main quantitative information, the novel multivariate model combines
advantages of both the conventional univariate and PLS models and partially
avoids the overuse of the unrelated noise in the spectrum for PLS application.
The dominant factor makes the combination model more robust over a wide
concentration range and PLS application improves the model accuracy for samples
with matrices within the calibration sample set. Results show that RMSEP of the
final dominant factor based PLS model decreased to 2.33% from 5.25% when using
the conventional PLS approach with full spectral information. Furthermore, with
the development in understanding the physics of the laser-induced plasma, there
is potential to easily improve the accuracy of the dominant factor model as
well as the proposed novel multivariate model.

tested by a randomized algorithm that reads at most q symbols from the given
word. An important question is whether there exist LTCs that have the
ccc-property: constant relative rate, constant relative distance, and that can
be tested with a constant number of queries. Such codes are sometimes referred
to as ""asymptotically good"".
  We show that dense LTCs cannot be ccc. The density of a tester is roughly the
average number of distinct local views in which a coordinate participates. An
LTC is dense if it has a tester with density >> 1.
  More precisely, we show that a 3-query locally testable code with a tester of
density >> 1 cannot be ccc. Moreover, we show that a q-query locally testable
code (q>3) with a tester of density >> n^{q-2} cannot be ccc. Our results hold
when the tester has the following two properties: 1) ""no weights"": Every
q-tuple of queries occurs with the same probability. 2) ""last-one-fixed"": In
every `test' of the tester, the value to any q-1 of the symbols determines the
value of the last symbol. (Linear codes have constraints of this type).
  We also show that several natural ways to quantitatively improve our results
would already resolve the general ccc-question, i.e. also for non-dense LTCs.

$F^{(p)}$ and the B-field strength $H$ on the world volume of D$_p$-branes at
order ${\cal O}(\alpha'^2)$. These couplings which have both world-volume and
transverse indices, are invariant under the linear T-duality transformations.
Consistency with the nonlinear T-duality indicates that the RR field strength
$F^{(p)}$ in these couplings should be replaced by ${\cal F}^{(p)}=d{\cal
C}^{(p-1)}$ where ${\cal C}=e^{B}C$. This replacement, however, reproduces some
non-gauge invariant terms. On the other hand, the nonlinear terms are invariant
under the linear T-duality transformations at the level of two B-fields. This
allows one to remove some of the nonlinear terms in ${\cal F}^{(p)}$. We fix
this by comparing the nonlinear couplings with the S-matrix element of one RR
and two NSNS vertex operators. Our results indicate that in the expansion of
${\cal F}^{(p)}$ one should keep only the B-field gauge invariant terms, e.g.
$B\wedge dC^{(p-3)}$ where both indices of B-field lie along the brane.
Moreover, in this case one should replace $B$ with $B+2\pi\alpha'f$ to have the

properties of infinite graphs and analytic and probabilistic objects such as

  For a transient random walk, there are several problems one is interested in:
for instance to study its convergence, to describe the bounded harmonic
functions for the random walk, to describe its Poisson boundary, or to study
the parameter of exponential decay of the transition probabilities of the
random walk.
  In the first part of the thesis we deal with similar problems in the context
of random walks on the so-called lamplighter graphs, which are wreath products
of graphs. The convergence and the Poisson boundary of lamplighter random walks
is studied for different underlying graphs, and the used methods are mostly of
a geometrical nature.
  In the second part of the thesis we consider Markov chains on directed,
labelled graphs. With such graphs we associate in a natural way a class of
infinite languages (sets of labels of paths in the graph) and we study the
growth sensitivity (or entropy sensitivity) of these languages using Markov
chains.

$\H_1^{n+1}\subset\R_2^{n+2}$ whose position vector $\psi$ satisfies the
condition $L_k\psi=A\psi+b$, where $L_k$ is the linearized operator of the
$(k+1)$-th mean curvature of the hypersurface, for a fixed $k=0,...,n-1$, $A$
is an $(n+2)\times(n+2)$ constant matrix and $b$ is a constant vector in the
corresponding pseudo-Euclidean space. For every $k$, we prove that when $A$ is
self-adjoint and $b=0$, the only hypersurfaces satisfying that condition are
hypersurfaces with zero $(k+1)$-th mean curvature and constant $k$-th mean
curvature, open pieces of standard pseudo-Riemannian products in $\S_1^{n+1}$

hypersurface $\{x\in\mathbb{M}_{c}^{n+1}\;|\;Rx,x=d\}$, where $R$ is a
self-adjoint constant matrix whose minimal polynomial is $t^2+at+b$,
$a^2-4b\leq 0$, and $\mathbb{M}_{c}^{n+1}$ stands for
$\S_1^{n+1}\subset\R_1^{n+2}$ or $\H_1^{n+1}\subset\R_2^{n+2}$. When $H_k$ is
constant and $b$ is a non-zero constant vector, we show that the hypersurface
is totally umbilical, and then we also obtain a classification result (see
Theorem 2).

conjecture that a certain homomorphism eta': T -> D' is an isomorphism. Here T
is an abelian group on labeled oriented trees, and D' is the kernel of a
bracketing map on a quasi-Lie algebra. Both T and D' have strong connections to
a variety of topological settings, including the mapping class group, homology
cylinders, finite type invariants, Whitney tower intersection theory, and the
homology of the group of automorphisms of the free group. In this paper, we
confirm Levine's conjecture. This is a central step in classifying the
structure of links up to grope and Whitney tower concordance, as explained in
other papers of this series. We also confirm and improve upon Levine's
conjectured relation between two filtrations of the group of homology
cylinders.

process algebras make models to be easily understood by human beings, but not
convenient for machines as well as people to directly carry out mathematical
analysis and stochastic simulation. This paper presents a numerical
representation schema for the stochastic process algebra PEPA, which can
provide a platform to directly and conveniently employ a variety of
computational approaches to both qualitatively and quantitatively analyse the
models. Moreover, these approaches developed on the basis of the schema are
demonstrated and discussed. In particular, algorithms for automatically
deriving the schema from a general PEPA model and simulating the model based on
the derived schema to derive performance measures are presented.

propagating in the neurons of the brain, signal propagation takes place in the
form of biophoton production. This statement is supported by recent
experimental confirmation of photon guiding properties of a single neuron. We
have investigated the interaction of mitochondrial biophotons with microtubules
from a quantum mechanical point of view. Our theoretical analysis indicates
that the interaction of biophotons and microtubules causes
transitions/fluctuations of microtubules between coherent and incoherent
states. A significant relationship between the fluctuation function of
microtubules and alpha-EEG diagrams is elaborated on in this paper. We argue
that the role of biophotons in the brain merits special attention.

  Energy Phenomenon","19 pages, 4 figures. Comments welcome",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Some consequences of a Modified Mass Concept (MMC) are discussed. According
to MMC the inertial mass is not only determined by its energy, but also by a
scalar field f depending on other masses. The concept consistently describes
the galactic rotation curves, the inflation of the universe and its accelerated
expansion, all without the necessity of Dark Matter (DM) and Dark Energy (DE).
Instead, the effects attributed to DM are caused by a reduction of inertia
acting as an enhancement of gravity. These results of MMC are similar to that
of MOND. The effects usually attributed to DE in MMC stem from a new equation
of state for baryonic matter, which always causes a negative pressure. In this
respect the results are similar to those of the two component LCDM. In
particular, according to MMC the late universe will pass into a state of
constant energy density. Furthermore, the MMC can provide an explanation of the
very high peculiar velocities found at large scales.
