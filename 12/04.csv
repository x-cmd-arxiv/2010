terms of dynamical phases and transitions between them in the trajectory space

paper, we study the thermodynamic approach for fluorescent systems coupled to
complex reservoirs that induce stochastic fluctuations in their dynamical
parameters. In a fast modulation limit the thermodynamics corresponds to that
of a Markovian two-level system. In a slow modulation limit, the thermodynamic
properties are equivalent to those of a finite system that in an infinite-size
limit is characterized by a first-order transition. The dynamical phases
correspond to different intensity regimes, while the size of the system is
measured by the transition rate of the bath fluctuations. As a function of a
dimensionless intensive variable, the first and second derivative of the
thermodynamic potential develop an abrupt change and a narrow peak
respectively. Their scaling properties are consistent with a double-Gaussian
probability distribution of the associated extensive variable.

models, such as probabilistic Boolean networks, logical models, Petri nets, and
agent-based models, with the goal to gain a better understanding of the system.
The computational complexity to analyze the complete dynamics of these models
grows exponentially in the number of variables, which impedes working with
complex models. Although there exist sophisticated algorithms to determine the
dynamics of discrete models, their implementations usually require
labor-intensive formatting of the model formulation, and they are oftentimes
not accessible to users without programming skills. Efficient analysis methods
are needed that are accessible to modelers and easy to use. Method: By
converting discrete models into algebraic models, tools from computational
algebra can be used to analyze their dynamics. Specifically, we propose a
method to identify attractors of a discrete model that is equivalent to solving
a system of polynomial equations, a long-studied problem in computer algebra.
Results: A method for efficiently identifying attractors, and the web-based
tool Analysis of Dynamic Algebraic Models (ADAM), which provides this and other
analysis methods for discrete models. ADAM converts several discrete model
types automatically into polynomial dynamical systems and analyzes their
dynamics using tools from computer algebra. Based on extensive experimentation
with both discrete models arising in systems biology and randomly generated
networks, we found that the algebraic algorithms presented in this manuscript
are fast for systems with the structure maintained by most biological systems,
namely sparseness, i.e., while the number of nodes in a biological network may
be quite large, each node is affected only by a small number of other nodes,
and robustness, i.e., small number of attractors.

potentials obtained in the model from the nonperturbative form of the spectral
action are sensitive not only to the geometry (flat or positively curved) of
the universe, but also to the different possible non-simply connected
topologies. We show this by explicitly computing the nonperturbative spectral
action for some candidate flat cosmic topologies given by Bieberbach manifolds

flat torus by a multiplicative factor, similarly to what happens in the case of
the spectral action of the spherical forms in relation to the case of the
3-sphere. We then show that, while the slow-roll parameters differ between the
spherical and flat manifolds but do not distinguish different topologies within

potential and therefore distinguish between the various topologies, both in the
spherical and in the flat case.

severely limited by energy losses to at most a few kiloparsec, thereby
rendering the local spectrum very sensitive to the exact distribution of
sources in our galactic neighbourhood. However, due to our ignorance of the
exact source distribution, we can only predict the spectrum stochastically. We
argue that even in the case of a large number of sources the central limit
theorem is not applicable, but that the standard deviation for the flux from a
random source is divergent due to a long power law tail of the probability
density. Instead, we compute the expectation value and characterise the scatter
around it by quantiles of the probability density using a generalised central
limit theorem in a fully analytical way. The uncertainty band is asymmetric
about the expectation value and can become quite large for TeV energies. In
particular, the predicted local spectrum is marginally consistent with the
measurements by Fermi-LAT and HESS even without imposing spectral breaks or
cut-offs at source. We conclude that this uncertainty has to be properly
accounted for when predicting electron fluxes above a few hundred GeV from
astrophysical sources.

Planet-hosting stars are known to be metal-rich, but whether or not this
peculiarity applies also to the chemical composition of the outer stellar
atmospheres is still to be clarified. More in general, coronal and photospheric
abundances in late-type stars appear to be different in many cases, but
understanding how chemical stratification effects work in stellar atmospheres
requires an observational base larger than currently available. We obtained
XMM-Newton high-resolution X-ray spectra of Tau Bootis, a well known nearby
star with a Jovian-mass close-in planet. We analyzed these data with the aim to
perform a detailed line-based emission measure analysis and derive the
abundances of individual elements in the corona with two different methods
applied independently. We compared the coronal abundances of Tau Bootis with
published photospheric abundances based on high-resolution optical spectra and
with those of other late-type stars with different magnetic activity levels,
including the Sun. We find that the two methods provide consistent results
within the statistical uncertainties for both the emission measure distribution
of the hot plasma and for the coronal abundances, with discrepancies at the
2-sigma level limited to the amount of plasma at temperatures of 3-4 MK and to
the O and Ni abundances. In both cases, the elements for which both coronal and
photospheric measurements are available (C, N, O, Si, Fe, and Ni) result
systematically less abundant in the corona by a factor 3 or more, with the
exception of the coronal Ni abundance, which is similar to the photospheric
value. Comparison with other late-type stars of similar activity level shows
that these coronal/photospheric abundance ratios are peculiar to Tau Bootis and
possibly related to the characteristic over-metallicity of this planet-hosting
star.

and study the classification problem in these limited settings. The first such
condition is that the order of the twist matrix is 2,3,4 or 6 and we obtain a
fairly complete description of these classes of modular categories. The second
condition is that the unit object is the only simple non-self-dual object,
which is equivalent to odd-dimensionality. In this case we obtain a (linear)
improvement on the bounds and employ number-theoretic techniques to obtain a
classification for rank at most 11 for odd-dimensional modular categories.

which a verifier interacts with two competing teams of provers: one team
attempts to convince the verifier to accept while the other attempts to
convince the verifier to reject. Each team consists of two provers who jointly
implement a no-signaling strategy. No-signaling strategies are a curious class
of joint strategy that cannot in general be implemented without communication
between the provers, yet cannot be used as a black box to establish
communication between them. Attention is restricted in this paper to two-turn
interactions in which the verifier asks questions of each of the four provers
and decides whether to accept or reject based on their responses.
  We prove that the complexity class of decision problems that admit two-turn
interactive proofs with competing teams of no-signaling provers is a subset of
PSPACE. This upper bound matches existing PSPACE lower bounds on the following
two disparate and weaker classes of interactive proof:
  1. Two-turn multi-prover interactive proofs with only one team of
no-signaling provers.
  2. Two-turn competing-prover interactive proofs with only one prover per
team.
  Our result implies that the complexity of these two models is unchanged by
the addition of a second competing team of no-signaling provers in the first
case and by the addition of a second no-signaling prover to each team in the
second case. Moreover, our result unifies and subsumes prior PSPACE upper
bounds on these classes.

studies with Spitzer of a sample of optically ""normal"" late-type galaxies
reveal remarkably the presence of high-ionization [NeV] lines in several
sources, providing strong evidence for AGNs in these galaxies. We present
follow-up X-ray observations recently obtained with XMM-Newton of two such
sources, the late-type optically normal galaxies NGC 3367 and NGC 4536. Both
sources are detected in our observations. Detailed spectral analysis reveals
that for both galaxies, the 2-10 keV emission is dominated by a power law with
an X-ray luminosity in the 10^39 - 10^40 ergs s^-1 range, consistent with low
luminosity AGNs. While there is a possibility that X-ray binaries account for
some fraction of the observed X-ray luminosity, we argue that this fraction is
negligible. These observations therefore add to the growing evidence that the
fraction of late-type galaxies hosting AGNs is significantly underestimated
using optical observations alone. A comparison of the mid-infrared [NeV]

the impact of recent high statistics lepton asymmetry data from the D0

the claimed retrograde component, which makes up only a tiny fraction of the
entire sample, prone to contaminations, is identified as the tail of distance
overestimates. The strong overestimates also result in a lift in the vertical
velocity component, which explains the large altitudes those objects were
claimed to reach. Errors are worst for the lowest metallicity stars, which
explains the metal-poor nature of the artificial component. We also argue that
measurement errors were not properly accounted for and that the use of Gaussian
fitting on intrinsically non-Gaussian Galactic components invokes the
identification of components that are distorted or even artificial. Our
evaluation of the data leads to a revision of the estimated velocity ellipsoids
and does not yield any reliable evidence for a counterrotating halo component.
If a distinct counterrotating halo component exists it must be far weaker than
claimed by Carollo et al. Finally we note that their revised analysis presented

acquires a mass by explicit breaking of a global shift symmetry at scale f. In
this case, for small field values, the potential is flat and stable under
radiative corrections. Nevertheless, slow roll conditions enforce f>>M_p making
the validity of the whole scenario questionable. In this letter, we show that a
coupling of the Inflaton kinetic term to the Einstein tensor allows f<<M_p by
enhancing the gravitational friction acting on the Inflaton during inflation.
This new unique interaction, a) keeps the theory perturbative in the whole
inflationary trajectory, b) preserves the tree-level shift invariance of the
pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone Boson and c) avoids the introduction of any new degrees
of freedom with respect the standard Natural Inflation.

where Wikipedia's concept-relatedness information is combined with a domain
ontology to produce semantic content classifiers. The approach is evaluated
using Reuters RCV1 corpus and TREC-11 filtering task definitions. In a

source evolved from quiescence to a low-activity level culminating in three

5 times that of the pre-flare luminosity. The minimum observed luminosity was
1.3x10^33 erg/s (d/2.7 kpc)^2 in the 0.5--10 keV range. The weak flares are
accompanied by significant changes in the spectral parameters including a
column density (nH = (4.1+-0.5)x10^22 /cm^2) that is ~2--9 times the absorption
measured during quiescence. Accretion of obscuring clumps of stellar wind
material can explain both the small flares and the increase in nH. Placing this
observation in the context of the recent Swift monitoring campaign, we find
that weak-flaring episodes, or at least epochs of enhanced activity just above
the quiescent level but well below the moderately bright or high-luminosity

three large time projection chambers (TPCs) for charged particle tracking. The
data collected with the tracker is used to study charged current neutrino
interaction rates and kinematics prior to oscillation, in order to reduce

photomultiplier tube readout, referred to as the Reaction Plane Detector
(RXNP), was designed and installed in the PHENIX experiment prior to the 2007
run of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The RXNP's design is
optimized to accurately measure the reaction plane (RP) angle of heavy-ion
collisions, where, for mid-central $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV Au+Au collisions,
it achieved a $2^{nd}$ harmonic RP resolution of $\sim$0.75, which is a factor
of $\sim$2 greater than PHENIX's previous capabilities. This improvement was
accomplished by locating the RXNP in the central region of the PHENIX
experiment, where, due to its large coverage in pseudorapidity
($1.0<|\eta|<2.8$) and $\phi$ (2$\pi$), it is exposed to the high particle
multiplicities needed for an accurate RP measurement. To enhance the observed
signal, a 2-cm Pb converter is located between the nominal collision region and
the scintillator paddles, allowing neutral particles produced in the heavy-ion
collisions to contribute to the signal through conversion electrons. This paper
discusses the design, operation and performance of the RXNP during the 2007
RHIC run.

carrier-induced dynamic strain effect. By this new model, superconducting state
consists of the dynamic bound state of superconducting electrons, which is
formed by the high-energy nonbonding electrons through dynamic interaction with
their surrounding lattice to trap themselves into the three - dimensional
potential wells lying in energy at above the Fermi level of the material. The
binding energy of superconducting electrons dominates the superconducting
transition temperature in the corresponding material. Under an electric field,
superconducting electrons move coherently with lattice distortion wave and
periodically exchange their excitation energy with chain lattice, that is, the
superconducting electrons transfer periodically between their dynamic bound
state and conducting state. Thus, the intrinsic feature of superconductivity is
to generate an oscillating current under a dc voltage. The coherence lengths in
cuprates must have the value equal to an even number times the lattice
constant. A superconducting material must simultaneously satisfy three criteria
required by superconductivity. Almost all of the puzzling behavior of the
cuprates can be uniquely understood under this new model. We demonstrate that
the factor 2 in Josephson current equation, in fact, is resulting from 2V, the
voltage drops across the two superconductor sections on both sides of a
junction, not from the Cooper pair, and the magnetic flux is quantized in units
of h/e, postulated by London, not in units of h/2e. The central features of
superconductivity, such as Josephson effect, the tunneling mechanism in
multijunction systems, and the origin of the superconducting tunneling
phenomena, are all physically reconsidered under this superconductivity model.

Real time applications have been most popular among the applications, run by ad

requirements such as overall throughput, end-toend delay and power level.
Support of QoS requirements becomes more challenging due to dynamic nature of

determining a path between source and destination with the QoS requirements of

requirements is carried out with a query packet at each node along the path
between source and destination. Simulations justify better performance of the
proposed new protocol in terms of network lifetime, end-to-end delay and packet

reduction of measurement back-action to negligible levels. To observe the
non-classical features of weak measurements, it is therefore more important to
avoid additional back-action errors than it is to avoid errors in the actual
measurement outcome. In this paper, it is shown how an optical weak measurement
of diagonal (PM) polarization can be realized by path interference between the
horizontal (H) and vertical (V) polarization components of the input beam. The
measurement strength can then be controlled by rotating the H and V
polarizations towards each other. This well-controlled operation effectively
generates the back-action without additional decoherence, while the visibility
of the interference between the two beams only limits the measurement
resolution. As the experimental results confirm, we can obtain extremely high
weak values, even at rather low visibilities. Our method therefore provides a
realization of weak measurements that is extremely robust against experimental
imperfections.

Quantum-mechanical tunneling through single-stranded DNA in a solid-state
nanopore has been proposed for rapid DNA sequencing, but unfortunately the
tunneling current alone cannot distinguish the four nucleotides due to large
fluctuations in molecular conformation and solvent. Here, we propose a
machine-learning approach applied to the tunneling current-voltage (I-V)
characteristic for efficient discrimination between the four nucleotides. We
first combine principal component analysis (PCA) and fuzzy c-means (FCM)
clustering to learn the ""fingerprints"" of the electronic density-of-states
(DOS) of the four nucleotides, which can be derived from the I-V data. We then
apply the hidden Markov model and the Viterbi algorithm to sequence a time
series of DOS data (i.e., to solve the sequencing problem). Numerical
experiments show that the PCA-FCM approach can classify unlabeled DOS data with
91% accuracy. Furthermore, the classification is found to be robust against
moderate levels of noise, i.e., 70% accuracy is retained with a signal-to-noise
ratio of 26 dB. The PCA-FCM-Viterbi approach provides a 4-fold increase in
accuracy for the sequencing problem compared with PCA alone. In conjunction
with recent developments in nanotechnology, this machine-learning method may
pave the way to the much-awaited rapid, low-cost genome sequencer.

objects to active galactic nuclei. In all the cases the jet propagates with a
supersonic velocity through the external medium, which can be inhomogeneous,
and inhomogeneities could penetrate into the jet. The interaction of the jet
material with an obstacle produces a bow shock in the jet in which particles
can be accelerated up to relativistic energies and emit high-energy photons. In
this work, we explore the active galactic nuclei scenario, focusing on the
dynamical and radiative consequences of the interaction at different jet
heights. We find that the produced high-energy emission could be detectable by
the current gamma-ray telescopes. In general, the jet-clump interactions are a
possible mechanism to produce (steady or flaring) high-energy emission in many
astrophysical sources in which jets are present.

existence of low degree metabolites. This observation allows a prediction of

pathogenic microorganisms and (b) regulatory modules within biological
