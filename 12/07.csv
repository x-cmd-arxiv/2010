organization of their interconnections but also by the dynamical processes
taking place among their constituents. A faithful modeling of the dynamics is
essential because different dynamical processes may be affected very
differently by network topology. A full characterization of such systems thus
requires a formalization that encompasses both aspects simultaneously, rather
than relying only on the topological adjacency matrix. To achieve this, we
introduce the concept of flow graphs, namely weighted networks where dynamical
flows are embedded into the link weights. Flow graphs provide an integrated
representation of the structure and dynamics of the system, which can then be
analyzed with standard tools from network theory. Conversely, a structural
network feature of our choice can also be used as the basis for the
construction of a flow graph that will then encompass a dynamics biased by such
a feature. We illustrate the ideas by focusing on the mathematical properties
of generic linear processes on complex networks that can be represented as
biased random walks and also explore their dual consensus dynamics.

correlated. However, while it is easy to write down toy theories allowing
arbitrary nonlocal correlations, those allowed in quantum mechanics are
limited. Quantum correlations cannot, for example, violate a principle known as
macroscopic locality, which implies that they cannot violate Tsirelson's bound.
This work shows that there is a connection between the strength of nonlocal
correlations in a physical theory, and the structure of the state spaces of
individual systems. This is illustrated by a family of models in which local
state spaces are regular polygons, where a natural analogue of a maximally
entangled state of two systems exists. We characterize the nonlocal
correlations obtainable from such states. The family allows us to study the
transition between classical, quantum, and super-quantum correlations, by
varying only the local state space. We show that the strength of nonlocal
correlations - in particular whether the maximally entangled state violates
Tsirelson's bound or not - depends crucially on a simple geometric property of
the local state space, known as strong self-duality. This result is seen to be
a special case of a general theorem, which states that a broad class of
entangled states in probabilistic theories - including, by extension, all
bipartite classical and quantum states - cannot violate macroscopic locality.
Finally, our results show that there exist models which are locally almost
indistinguishable from quantum mechanics, but can nevertheless generate
maximally nonlocal correlations.

interferometer (FPI) based instrument in solar observations results in specific
calibration issues. FPIs generally show variations over the field-of-view,
while in the image restoration process, the 1-to-1 relation between pixel space
and image space is lost, thus complicating any correcting for such variations.
aims: We develop a data reduction method that takes these issues into account
and minimizes the resulting errors. methods: By accounting for the time
variations in the telescope's Mueller matrix and using separate calibration
data optimized for the wavefront sensing in the MOMFBD image restoration
process and for the final deconvolution of the data, we have removed most of
the calibration artifacts from the resulting data. results: Using this method
to reduce full Stokes data from CRISP at the SST, we find that it drastically
reduces the instrumental and image restoration artifacts resulting from cavity
errors, reflectivity variations, and the polarization dependence of flatfields.
The results allow for useful scientific interpretation. Inversions of restored
data from the $\delta$ sunspot AR11029 using the Nicole inversion code, reveal
strong (~10 km/s) downflows near the disk center side of the umbra.
conclusions: The use of image restoration in combination with an FPI-based
instrument leads to complications in the calibrations and intrinsic limitations
to the accuracy that can be achieved. We find that for CRISP, the resulting
errors can be kept mostly below the polarimetric accuracy of ~10^-3. Similar
instruments aiming for higher polarimetric and high spectroscopic accuracy,
will, however, need to take these problems into account. keywords: Techniques:

confinement is reviewed. The answer to this question crucially depends on the
mechanism of mass generation in QCD and interconnection of confinement and
chiral symmetry breaking. This question can be clarified from spectroscopy of
hadrons and their axial properties. Almost systematical parity doubling of
highly excited hadrons suggests that their mass is not related to chiral
symmetry breaking in the vacuum and is approximately chirally symmetric. Then
there is a possibility for existence of confining but chirally symmetric
matter. We clarify a possible mechanism underlying such a phase at low
temperatures and large density. Namely, at large density the Pauli blocking
prevents the gap equation to generate a solution with broken chiral symmetry.
However, the chirally symmetric part of the quark Green function as well as all
color non-singlet quantities are still infrared divergent, meaning that the
system is with confinement. A possible phase transition to such a matter is
most probably of the first order. This is because there are no chiral partners
to the lowest lying hadrons.

#P-complete, since Irving and Leather demonstrated #P-completeness for the

of stable roommate assignments in the $k$-attribute model ($k \geq 4$) and the
3-Euclidean model($k \geq 3$) is interreducible, in an approximation-preserving
sense, with counting independent sets (of all sizes) (#IS) in a graph, or
counting the number of satisfying assignments of a Boolean formula (#SAT). This
means that there can be no FPRAS for any of these problems unless NP=RP. As a
consequence, we infer that there is no FPRAS for counting stable roommate
assignments (#SR) unless NP=RP. Utilizing previous results by the authors, we
give an approximation-preserving reduction from counting the number of
independent sets in a bipartite graph (#BIS) to counting the number of stable
roommate assignments both in the 3-attribute model and in the 2-Euclidean
model. #BIS is complete with respect to approximation-preserving reductions in
the logically-defined complexity class $#RH\Pi_1$. Hence, our result shows that
an FPRAS for counting stable roommate assignments in the 3-attribute model
would give an FPRAS for all of $#RH\Pi_1$. We also show that the 1-attribute
stable roommate problem always has either one or two stable roommate
assignments, so the number of assignments can be determined exactly in

Speckle Stabilization was initially conceived for integral field spectroscopic
analyses, the technique shares many similarities with speckle imaging
(specifically shift-and-add and Lucky Imaging). Therefore, it is worth
comparing the two for imaging applications. We have modeled observations on a
2.5-meter class telescope to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the two
techniques. While the differences are relatively minor, we find that Speckle
Stabilization is a viable competitor to current Lucky Imaging systems.
Specifically, we find that Speckle Stabilization is 3.35 times more efficient
(where efficiency is defined as signal-to-noise per observing interval) than
shift-and-add and able to detect targets 1.42 magnitudes fainter when using a
standard system. If we employ a high-speed shutter to compare to Lucky Imaging
at 1% image selection, Speckle Stabilization is 1.28 times more efficient and
0.31 magnitudes more sensitive. However, when we incorporate potential
modifications to Lucky Imaging systems we find the advantages are significantly
mitigated and even reversed in the 1% frame selection cases. In particular, we
find that in the limiting case of Optimal Lucky Imaging, that is zero read
noise {\it and} photon counting, we find Lucky Imaging is 1.80 times more

star with theoretical evolutionary tracks, we conclude that the initial mass of
the progenitor is likely to be ~1.5-2.0 Msun and the age is ~3000 yr after the
AGB phase. The observed elemental abundances can be explained by a theoretical
nucleosynthesis model with a star of initial mass 2.25 Msun, Z=0.008 and LMC
compositions. We have estimated the dust mass to be 2.9x10^-4 Msun (amorphous
carbon only) or 4.0x10^-4 Msun (amorphous carbon and PAH). Based on the
assumption that most of the observed dust is formed during the last two thermal
pulses and the dust-to-gas mass ratio is 5.58x10^-3, the dust mass-loss rate
and the total mass-loss rate are <3.1x10^-8 Msun / yr and <5.5x10^-6 Msun / yr,

Gauge Theories. Instead of looking at the expectation value of Polyakov loop
correlators we study the modifications induced in the chromoelectric flux by
the presence of the Polyakov loops. In abelian LGTs, thanks to duality, this
study can be performed in a very efficient way, allowing to reach high
precision at a reasonable CPU cost. The major advantage of this strategy is
that it allows to eliminate the dominant effective string correction to the
interquark potential (the Luscher term) thus giving an unique opportunity to
test higher order corrections. Performing a set of simulations in the 3d gauge
Ising model we were thus able to precisely identify and measure both the
quartic and the sextic effective string corrections to the interquark
potential. While the quartic term perfectly agrees with the Nambu-Goto one the
sextic term is definitely different. Our result seems to disagree with the
recent proof of the universality of the sextic correction. We discuss a few
possible explanations of this disagreement.

new system for uniform solving of a wide class of problems by reducing them to

and declarative programming paradigms. The reduction to SAT is defined
precisely by the semantics of the specification language. The domain of the
approach is wide (e.g., many NP-complete problems can be simply specified and
then solved by the system) and there are problems easily solvable by the
proposed system, while they can be hardly solved by using other programming
languages or constraint programming systems. So, the system can be seen not
only as a tool for solving problems by reducing them to SAT, but also as a
general-purpose constraint solving system (for finite domains). In this paper,
we also describe an open-source implementation of the described approach. The
performed experiments suggest that the system is competitive to
state-of-the-art related modelling systems.

polynomial dynamical systems. An invariant set of a dynamical system is a
subset of the state space such that if the state of the system belongs to the
set at a given instant, it will remain in the set forever in the future.
Polytopic invariants for polynomial systems can be verified by solving a set of
optimization problems involving multivariate polynomials on bounded polytopes.
Using the blossoming principle together with properties of multi-affine
functions on rectangles and Lagrangian duality, we show that certified lower
bounds of the optimal values of such optimization problems can be computed
effectively using linear programs. This allows us to propose a method based on
linear programming for verifying polytopic invariant sets of polynomial
dynamical systems. Additionally, using sensitivity analysis of linear programs,
one can iteratively compute a polytopic invariant set. Finally, we show using a
set of examples borrowed from biological applications, that our approach is
effective in practice.

modeling for various phenomena in large distributed systems, such as sensor

performed by comparing measurements between sensors, resulting in statistical
dependency among faults. We present a new formulation for multiple interacting
faults in a distributed system. The formulation includes specifications of how
individual subsystems composing the large system may fail, the information that
can be shared among these subsystems and the interaction pattern between
faults. We then specify a new sequential algorithm for detecting these faults.
The main feature of the algorithm is that it uses composite stopping rules for
a subsystem that depend on the decision of other subsystems. We provide
asymptotic false alarm and detection delay analysis for this algorithm in the
Bayesian setting and show that under certain conditions the algorithm is
optimal. The analysis methodology relies on novel detailed comparison
techniques between stopping times. We validate the approach with some

the notion that the structure of a fault system also affects the statistical

the same free energy structure is obtained together with the existence of its
thermodynamic limit and the minimax principle is connected to a standard max
one. The same is investigated for bipartite spin-glasses: By the Borel-Cantelli
lemma a control of the high temperature regime is obtained, while via the
double stochastic stability technique we get also the explicit expression of
the free energy at the replica symmetric level, uniquely defined by a minimax

show further that at zero temperature the replica symmetric entropy becomes
negative and, consequently, such a symmetry must be broken. The treatment of
the fully broken replica symmetry case is deferred to a forthcoming paper. As a
first step in this direction, we start deriving the linear and quadratic

when $P$ is concentrated on the homogeneous all-plus configuration, where the
mixing time $T_{mix}$ is conjectured to be polynomial in $L$. In [MT] it was
shown that for a large enough inverse-temperature $\beta$ and any $\epsilon >0$
there exists $c=c(\beta,\epsilon)$ such that $\lim_{L\to\infty}P(T_{mix}\geq

decision maker interactions which naturally extends the multi-populations
approaches by shifting and biasing the pattern definitions of an Hopfield model
of neural networks. Once introduced, the model is investigated trough graph
theory (to recover Granovetter and Watts-Strogats results) and statistical
mechanics (to recover Mac-Fadden and Brock-Durlauf results). Due to internal
symmetries of our model, the latter is obtained as the relaxation of a proper
Markov process, allowing even to study its out of equilibrium properties. The
method used to solve its equilibrium is an adaptation of the Hamilton-Jacobi
technique recently introduced by Guerra in the spin glass scenario and the
picture obtained is the following: just by assuming that the larger the amount
of similarities among decision makers, the stronger their relative influence,
this is enough to explain both the different role of strong and weak ties in
the social network as well as its small world properties. As a result,
imitative interaction strengths seem essentially a robust request (enough to
break the gauge symmetry in the couplings), furthermore, this naturally leads
to a discrete choice modelization when dealing with the external influences and
to imitative behavior a la Curie-Weiss as the one introduced by Brock and

with no explosion. This flux has a hotter energy spectrum compared to regular,
neutron-star forming collapses, and therefore it dominates the total diffuse
flux from core collapses above 20-45 MeV of neutrino energy. Reflecting the
features of the originally emitted neutrinos, the flux of nu_e and anti-nu_e at
Earth is larger for larger survival probability of these species, and for
stiffer equations of state of nuclear matter. In the energy window 19-29 MeV,
the flux from failed supernovae is susbtantial, ranging from 7% to a dominant
fraction of the total flux from all core collapses. It can be as large as phi =
0.38 s^{-1} cm^{-2} for anti-nu_e (phi = 0.28 s^{-1} cm^{-2} for nue),
normalized to a local rate of core collapses of R_{cc}(0)=10^{-4} yr^{-1}
Mpc^{-3}. In 5 years, a 0.45 Mt water Cherenkov detector should see 5-65 events
from failed supernovae, while up to 160 events are expected for the same mass
with Gadolinium addition. A 0.1 Mt liquid argon experiment should record 1-11
events. Signatures of neutrinos from failed supernovae are the enhancement of
the total rates of events from core collapses (up to a factor of 2) and the
appearance of high energy tails in the event spectra.

properties provide unique perspective on chemical and dynamical processes that
shaped the Solar System. The current study was undertaken to investigate
surface compositions of these objects. We present 66 new near-infrared (NIR;
0.7 to 2.5 microns) spectra of 58 Trojans, including members of both the
leading and trailing swarms. We also include in the analysis previously
published NIR spectra of 13 Trojans (3 of which overlap with the new sample).
This data set permits not only a direct search for compositional signatures,
but also a search for patterns that may reveal clues to the origin of the
Trojans. We do not report any confirmed absorption features in the new spectra.
Analysis of the spectral slopes, however, reveals an interesting bimodality
among the NIR data. The two spectral groups identified appear to be equally
abundant in the leading and trailing swarms. The spectral groups are not a
result of family membership; they occur in the background, non-family
population. The average albedos of the two groups are the same within
uncertainties (0.051\pm0.016 and 0.055\pm0.016). No correlations between
spectral slope and any other physical or orbital parameter are detected, with
the exception of a possible weak correlation with inclination among the
less-red spectral group. Synthesizing these results with previously published
properties, we conclude that the two spectral groups represent objects with
different intrinsic compositions. We further suggest that while the less-red
group originated near Jupiter or in the main asteroid belt, the redder spectral
group originated farther out in the Solar System. If correct, the Trojan swarms
offer the most readily accessible large reservoir of Kuiper Belt material as
well as a unique reservoir for the study of material from the middle part of
the solar nebula.

crucial way on the diffusion coefficient of the problem. The analysis of the
proposed preconditioners is presented for both symmetric and non-symmetric IP

the non-nested character of the relevant discrete spaces presents extra
difficulties in the analysis which precludes a simple extension of existing
results. However, we are able to establish robustness (with respect to the
diffusion coefficient) and nearly-optimality (up to a logarithmic term
depending on the mesh size) for both two-level and BPX-type preconditioners.
Following the analysis, we present a sequence of detailed numerical results

SINR and spectral efficiency converge with probability 1 to asymptotic limits
as N increases. This technique is applied to networks with power-law node
intensities, which includes homogeneous networks as a special case, to find a
simple approximation for the spectral efficiency. It is found that for
receivers in dense clusters, the SINR grows with N at rates higher than that of
homogeneous networks and that constant spectral efficiencies can be maintained
if the ratio of N to node density is constant. This result also enables the
analysis of a new scaling regime where the distribution of nodes in the network
flattens rather than increases uniformly. It is found that in many cases in
this regime, N needs to grow approximately exponentially to maintain a constant
spectral efficiency. In addition to strengthening previously known results for

and CH+ along 13 lines of sight through diffuse molecular clouds. The data are
examined to extract precise isotopologic ratios of 12CN/13CN and 12CH+/13CH+ in
order to assess predictions of diffuse cloud chemistry. Our results on
12CH+/13CH+ confirm that this ratio does not deviate from the ambient 12C/13C
ratio in local interstellar clouds, as expected if the formation of CH+
involves nonthermal processes. We find that 12CN/13CN, however, can be
significantly fractionated away from the ambient value. The dispersion in our
sample of 12CN/13CN ratios is similar to that found in recent surveys of
12CO/13CO. For sight lines where both ratios have been determined, the
12CN/13CN ratios are generally fractionated in the opposite sense compared to
12CO/13CO. Chemical fractionation in CO results from competition between
selective photodissociation and isotopic charge exchange. An inverse
relationship between 12CN/13CN and 12CO/13CO follows from the coexistence of CN
and CO in diffuse cloud cores. However, an isotopic charge exchange reaction
with CN may mitigate the enhancements in 12CN/13CN for lines of sight with low
12CO/13CO ratios. For two sight lines with high values of 12CO/13CO, our
results indicate that about 50 percent of the carbon is locked up in CO, which
is consistent with the notion that these sight lines probe molecular cloud
envelopes where the transition from C+ to CO is expected to occur. An analysis
of CN rotational excitation yields a weighted mean value for T_01(12CN) of
2.754 +/- 0.002 K, which implies an excess over the temperature of the cosmic
microwave background of only 29 +/- 3 mK. This modest excess eliminates the
need for a local excitation mechanism beyond electron and neutral collisions.
The rotational excitation temperatures in 13CN show no excess over the
temperature of the CMB.

optimal instruments in linear instrumental variables (IV) models with many
instruments in the canonical Gaussian case. The methods apply even when the

distributions for the resulting IV estimators and provide conditions under
which these sparsity-based IV estimators are asymptotically oracle-efficient.
In simulation experiments, a sparsity-based IV estimator with a data-driven
penalty performs well compared to recently advocated many-instrument-robust
procedures. We illustrate the procedure in an empirical example using the
Angrist and Krueger (1991) schooling data.

formula of Alvarez-Gaum\'e and Witten in twelve dimensions and leads naturally
to the Kreck-Stolz s-invariant in eleven dimensions. Hence M-theory detects
diffeomorphism type of eleven-dimensional (and seven-dimensional) manifolds,

eleven-spheres. Furthermore, requiring the phase of the partition function to

coincide with the function called $Z_{\text{\sf{bif}}}$ appearing in the

lead to the expansion proposed in \cite{Alday:2009aq}. We found that this basis

enriched, low entropy gas from the core of the approaching, major subcluster,

the previously known bright, compact core associated with the receding

decays of superpartners. QCD backgrounds that would otherwise overwhelm the
Higgs decay are suppressed by the requirement of high p_T jets and large
missing transverse momentum that are the typical signatures of TeV scale
supersymmetry. Utilizing jet substructure techniques, we find that for buried
Higgses in the 100-120 GeV range, a 5-sigma discovery can be expected with
roughly 10-25 inverse fb of data at E_CM = 14 TeV. For lighter Higgs bosons,
the signal is contaminated by hadronically decaying W bosons, and discovery
remains an unsolved challenge.

stellar mass at 1 < z < 2 using data from the NEWFIRM Medium Band Survey
(NMBS). The precise photometric redshifts and stellar masses that the NMBS
produces allows us to define a series of mass limited samples of galaxies more
massive than 0.7, 1 and 3x10^10 Msun in redshift intervals centered on z = 1.1,
1.5 and 1.9 respectively. In each redshift interval we show that there exists a
strong dependence of clustering strength on the stellar mass limit of the
sample, with more massive galaxies showing a higher clustering amplitude on all
scales. We further interpret our clustering measurements in the LCDM
cosmological context using the halo model of galaxy clustering. We show that
the typical halo mass of central and satellite galaxies increases with stellar
mass, whereas the satellite fraction decreases with stellar mass, qualitatively
the same as is seen at z < 1. We see little evidence of any redshift dependence
in the stellar mass-to-halo mass relationship over our narrow redshift range.
However, when we compare with similar measurements at z~0, we see clear
evidence for a change in this relation. If we assume a universal baryon
fraction, the ratio of stellar mass to halo mass reveals the fraction of
baryons that have been converted to stars. We see that the peak in this star
formation efficiency for central galaxies shifts to higher halo masses at
higher redshift, moving from ~7x10^11 Msun at z~0 to ~3x10^12 Msun at z~1.5,
revealing evidence of `halo downsizing'. Finally we show that for highly biased
galaxy populations at z > 1 there may be a discrepancy between the measured
space density and clustering and that predicted by the halo model. This could
imply that there is a problem with one or more ingredients of the halo model at
these redshifts, for instance the halo bias relation or the halo profile.

~120,000 robust galaxy redshifts over 9.1 deg^2 out to z ~ 1. We select a
sample of galaxies in isolated galaxy pairs at redshifts 0.25 < z < 0.75, with
no other objects within a projected separation of 300 h^-1 kpc and dz/(1+z) =
0.01, and compare them to a control sample of isolated galaxies to test for
systematic differences in their rest-frame FUV-r and NUV-r colors as a proxy
for relative specific SFR. We find that galaxies in r_p < 50 h^-1 kpc pairs
have bluer dust-corrected UV-r colors on average than the control galaxies by
-0.134 +/- 0.045 magnitudes in FUV-r and -0.075 +/- 0.038 magnitudes in NUV-r,
corresponding to a ~15-20% increase in SSFR. This indicates an enhancement in
SSFR due to tidal interactions. We also find that this relative enhancement is
greater for a subset of r_p < 30 h^-1 kpc pair galaxies, for which the average
colors offsets are -0.193 +/- 0.065 magnitudes in FUV-r and -0.159 +/- 0.048
magnitudes in NUV-r, corresponding to a ~25-30% increase in SSFR. We test for
evolution in the enhancement of tidally-triggered star formation with redshift
across our sample redshift range and find marginal evidence for a decrease in
SSFR enhancement from 0.25 < z < 0.5 to 0.5 < z < 0.75. This indicates that a
change in enhanced star formation triggered by tidal interactions in low
density environments is not a contributor to the decline in the global star
formation rate density across this redshift range.

determining the impact of multi-angle effects on the flavor evolution. For
neutrino spectra presenting only a single-crossing, synchronization of
different angular modes prevails over multi-angle effects, producing the known

multi-angle effects would produce a sizable delay in the onset of the flavor
conversions, as recently observed. We show that, due to the only partial
adiabaticity of the evolution at large radii, the multi-angle suppression can
be so strong to dramatically affect the final oscillated neutrino spectra. In

instability. This generic feature of scalar fields coupled to curvature may
affect the birth and the equilibrium structure of relativistic stars. We point
out that the semiclassical instability has a classical counterpart, which
occurs exactly in the same region of the parameter space. For negative values
of the coupling parameter the instability is equivalent to the well-known
""spontaneous scalarization"" effect: the plausible end-state of the instability
is a static, asymptotically flat equilibrium configuration with nonzero
expectation value for the quantum fields, which is compatible with experiments
in the weak-field regime and energetically favored over stellar solutions in
general relativity. For positive values of the coupling parameter the new
configurations are energetically disfavored, and the end-point of the
instability remains an open and interesting issue. The vacuum instability may
provide a natural mechanism to produce spontaneous scalarization, leading to
new experimental opportunities to probe the nature of vacuum energy via
astrophysical observations of compact stars.

All interactions can be perturbative up to the GUT scale, and gauge coupling
unification is preserved if the colored mediators come in complete GUT

R-hadrons, a signal visible in early LHC running. A smoking-gun signal that the
stable colored particles are mediators of h -> 4j is R-hadron production in

$k$ there is a $d$ such that whenever $R^d$ is $k$-coloured it contains a
monochromatic set congruent to $X$. This notion was introduced by Erdos,
Graham, Montgomery, Rothschild, Spencer and Straus, who asked if a set is
Ramsey if and only if it is spherical, meaning that it lies on the surface of a
sphere. This question (made into a conjecture by Graham) has dominated
subsequent work in Euclidean Ramsey theory. In this paper we introduce a new
conjecture regarding which sets are Ramsey; this is the first ever `rival'
conjecture to the conjecture above. Calling a finite set transitive if its
symmetry group acts transitively---in other words, if all points of the set
look the same---our conjecture is that the Ramsey sets are precisely the
transitive sets, together with their subsets. One appealing feature of this
conjecture is that it reduces (in one direction) to a purely combinatorial
statement. We give this statement as well as several other related conjectures.
We also prove the first non-trivial cases of the statement. Curiously, it is
far from obvious that our new conjecture is genuinely different from the old.
We show that they are indeed different by proving that not every spherical set
embeds in a transitive set. This result may be of independent interest.

unique combination of temporal resolution from single dish monitoring and
spatial resolution from VLBA imaging; such measurements, now available in all
four Stokes parameters, together with theoretical simulations, identify the
origin of radio band variability and probe the characteristics of the radio jet
where the broadband blazar emission originates. Outbursts in total flux density
and linear polarization in the optical-to-radio bands are attributed to shocks
propagating within the jet spine, in part based on limited modeling invoking
transverse shocks; new radiative transfer simulations allowing for shocks at
arbitrary angle to the flow direction confirm this picture by reproducing the
observed centimeter-band variations observed more generally, and are of current
interest since these shocks may play a role in the gamma-ray flaring detected
by Fermi. Recent UMRAO multifrequency Stokes V studies of bright blazars
identify the spectral variability properties of circular polarization for the
first time and demonstrate that polarity flips are relatively common.
All-Stokes data are consistent with the production of circular polarization by
linear-to-circular mode conversion in a region that is at least partially
self-absorbed. Detailed analysis of single-epoch, multifrequency, all-Stokes

information we compress the tangential velocity profiles of a diverse set of
vortices into one and thus identify those that belong to the same genus.
Examining the Laser Doppler Anemometer (LDA) results of mechanically produced
vortices and radar data of several tropical cyclones, we find that the uplift
and flattening effect of tangential velocity is a consequence of turbulence.
Reasoning by analogy we conclude that turbulence in the interstellar medium
could indeed introduce a flattening effect in the galactic rotation curves.

In this scenario electrons are accelerated in a series of knots, whose sizes
follow a power-law distribution. These knots presumably move outwards from the
pulsar and have a distribution in the Doppler boost factor. The maximal
electron energy is assumed to be proportional to the size of the knot.
Fluctuations at the highest energy end of the overall electron distribution
will result in variable $\gamma$-ray emission via the synchrotron process in
the $\sim 100$ MeV range. Since highly boosted larger knots are rarer than
smaller knots, the model predicts that the variability of the synchrotron
emission increases with the photon energy. We realize such a scenario with a
Monte-Carlo simulation and find that the model can reproduce both the two
$\gamma$-ray flares over a period of $\sim$ year and the monthly scale
$\gamma$-ray flux fluctuations as observed by the Fermi/LAT. The observed
$\gamma$-ray spectra in both the steady and flaring states are also well
reproduced.

waves. The electron beam splitter is an essential component of quantum logical
devices. To arrive at the beam splitter structure, the electrons are treated as
waves, i.e. we assume the transport to be ballistic. Ballistic electrons are
electrons that travel over such short distances that their phase coherence is
maintained. For mesoscopic devices with size smaller than the mean free path,
the phase relaxation length and the Fermi wavelength of electrons in the
medium, the transport can be considered to be coherent and hence ballistic. In
such a case the electron motion can be completely described by the
Schrodinger's wave equation with an effective mass assigned to the electron. To
design a beam splitter, we draw inspiration from an electromagnetic beam
splitter, where the Maxwell's equations (and subsequently the Helmholtz
equation) are used to describe the splitting of light across a thin slab of
dielectric material. The parameters of the media and the thickness of the slab
can be manipulated to achieve a 50-50 beam splitter. We wish to achieve a
similar 50-50 beam splitting for the electron wave. Using an analogy between
the scalar Helmholtz equation and the Schrodinger's equation for a ballistic
electron, we arrive at this desired beam splitter structure for the electron.

fully derived using the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) in extra

between the GUP and Modified Dispersion Relations (MDR). However, the form of
the MDR in theories with extra dimensions is as yet not known. The purpose of
this letter is to derive the MDR in extra dimensional scenarios. To achieve
this goal, we focus our attention on the thermodynamics of a FRW universe
within a proposed MDR in an extra dimensional model universe. We then compare
our results with the well-known results for the thermodynamics of a FRW
universe in an extra dimensional GUP setup. The result shows that the entropy
functionals calculated in these two approaches are the same, pointing to a
possible conclusion that these approaches are equivalent. In this way, we
derive the MDR form in a model universe with extra dimensions that would have
interesting implications on the construction of the ultimate quantum gravity
scenario.

transformation mechanism in Poynting dominated outflows. We show that the
reconnection is facilitated by the Kruskal-Schwarzschild instability of current
sheets separating the oppositely directed fields. This instability, which is a
magnetic counterpart of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability, develops if the flow
is accelerated. Then the plasma drips out of the current sheet providing
conditions for rapid reconnection. Since the magnetic dissipation leads to the
flow acceleration, the process is self-sustaining. In pulsar winds, this
process could barely compete with the earlier proposed dissipation mechanisms.
However, the novel mechanism turns out to be very efficient at AGN and GRB

demonstrated.

magnetars, as core densities exceed a threshold, the strong interaction induces
a phase transition to a neutral pion condensate that aligns all magnetic
moments. The core magnetic field is initially shielded by the ambient high
conductivity plasma. With time the shielding currents dissipate transporting
the core field out, first to the crust and then breaking through the crust to
the surface of the star. Recent observations provide strong support for this

the transmitter at NWC. First, we mapped the electron flux distribution and
figured out the special range what the NWC belt covered. Then we investigated
the NWC electron spectrograms in a wide range of McIlwain parameter (up to
L=3.0). Finally, we obtained the averaged energy spectrum of the NWC electrons

VLF emission induced either enhancement or loss of electrons in higher magnetic
shells up to L=3, and the maximum loss was up to 60% of the original value. The

daytime are more attenuated than those in the NWC nighttime, and that the shape
and the cutoff energy of the spectra are also quite different. We will present

theoretical calculations to explore the dependence of the rate coefficient on
ion temperature and to study the contributions of different symmetries to probe
the rich predicted resonance spectrum. The break-up energy was investigated by
fragment imaging to derive internal temperatures of the stored parent ions
under differing experimental conditions. A systematic experimental assessment
of heating effects is performed which, together with a survey of other recent
storage-ring data, suggests that the present rotationally cool rate-coefficient
measurement was performed at 380^{+50}_{-130} K and that this is the lowest
rotational temperature so far realized in storage-ring rate-coefficient
measurements on H3+. This partially supports the theoretical suggestion that
higher temperatures than assumed in earlier experiments are the main cause for
the large gap between the experimental and theoretical rate coefficients. For
the rotationally hot rate-coefficient measurement a temperature of below 3250K
is derived. From these higher-temperature results it is found that increasing
the rotational ion temperature in the calculations cannot fully close the gap
between the theoretical and experimental rate coefficients.

the theoretical framework for weak decays that will allow us to distinguish

accompanied by flavour blind phases we will discuss a number of extensions
containing non-MFV sources of flavour and CP violation and, in particular, new
local operators originating in right-handed charged currents and scalar
currents. Next we will address various anomalies in the data as seen from the
point of view of the SM that appear very natural in certain extensions of the
SM. In this presentation selected superstars of this field will play a very
important role. These are processes that are very sensitive to NP effects and
which are theoretically clean. Particular emphasis will be put on correlations
between various observables that could allow us to distinguish between various
NP scenarios. Armed with this knowledge we will propose a coding system in a

due to cationic disordering at the Ln sites upon such a transition is shown for

effect of increasing TS dramatically, while the size mismatch {\sigma}2 at the

sites modifies the nature of the hysteretic transition by turning the sharp
first order transition seen in the undoped samples into an intermix of first

confusion in the radial-velocity measurements. RV planet search surveys as well
as follow-up of photometric transit surveys require a deeper understanding and
characterization of the effects of stellar activities to disentangle it from
planetary signals. We simulate dark spots on a rotating stellar photosphere.
The variations of the photometry, RV and spectral line shapes are characterized
and analyzed according to the stellar inclination, the latitude and the number
of spots. The Lomb-Scargle periodograms of the RV variations induced by
activity present power at the rotational period Prot of the star and its
two-first harmonics Prot/2 and Prot/3. Three adjusted sinusoids fixed at Prot
and its two-first harmonics allow to remove about 90% of the RV jitter
amplitude. We apply and validate our approach on four known active planet-host
stars: HD189733, GJ674, CoRoT-7 and iHor. We succeed in fitting simultaneously
activity and planetary signals on GJ674 and CoRoT-7. This simultaneous modeling
of the activity and planetary parameters leads to slightly larger masses of
CoRoT-7b and c: respectively, 5.7+/-2.5ME and 13.1+/-4.1ME. The larger
uncertainties take into account properly for the stellar active jitter. We
excluded short-period low-mass exoplanets around iHor. For data with realistic
time-sampling and white Gaussian noise, we use simulations to show that our
approach is efficient to disentangle reflex-motion due to a planetary companion
and stellar-activity induced-RV variations provided that 1) the planetary
orbital period is not close to that of the stellar rotation or one of its
two-first harmonics 2) the semi-amplitude of the planet exceeds 30% of the
semi-amplitude of the active signal 3) the rotational period of the star is
accurately known 4) the data cover more than one stellar rotational period.

the deduction of a (voltage-dependent) domain in the stretch space which

090618, the dense sampling of our optical observations has allowed us to detect
well-defined bumps in the optical LCs, as well as a change in colour, that are
indicative of light coming from a core-collapse SN. The accompanying SNe for
both events are individually compared with SN1998bw, a known GRB-supernova, and
SN1994I, a typical type Ic supernova without a known GRB counterpart, and in
both cases the brightness and temporal evolution more closely resemble
SN1998bw. We also exploit our extensive optical and radio data for GRB 090618,

magnitudes of all of the GRB and X-Ray Flash (XRF)-associated SNe with a large

providing an all-optical probe of structural transitions. We examine the

potential NIR (2MASS and/or UKIDSS) counterparts inside their error circles,
consistent with the dominant soft X-ray source population being relatively
nearby coronally-active stars. These stellar counterparts are generally
brighter than J=16, a brightness cutoff which corresponds to the saturation of
the X-ray coronal emission at L_X=10^{-3} L_{bol}. In contrast, the success
rate in finding likely IR counterparts to the hard X-ray sample is no more than
~15% down to J=16 and ~25% down to J=20, set against a rapidly rising chance
coincidence rate. The make-up of the hard X-ray source population, in terms of
the known classes of accreting and non-accreting systems, remains uncertain.

investigating the luminosity function (LF) of galaxies of different
morphological types and colours at different environmental density levels.
  We construct the LFs separately for galaxies of different morphology (spiral
and elliptical) and of different colours (red and blue) using data from the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), correcting the luminosities for the intrinsic
absorption. We use the global luminosity density field to define different
environments, and analyse the environmental dependence of galaxy morphology and
colour. The smoothed bootstrap method is used to calculate confidence regions
of the derived luminosity functions.
  We find a strong environmental dependency for the LF of elliptical galaxies.
The LF of spiral galaxies is almost environment independent, suggesting that
spiral galaxy formation mechanisms are similar in different environments.
Absorption by the intrinsic dust influences the bright-end of the LF of spiral
galaxies. After attenuation correction, the brightest spiral galaxies are still
about 0.5 mag less luminous than the brightest elliptical galaxies, except in
the least dense environment, where spiral galaxies dominate the LF at every
luminosity. Despite the extent of the SDSS survey, the influence of single rich
superclusters is present in the galactic LF of the densest environment.

randomization of the network using edge exchange generates fictitious reactions
that are biochemically meaningless. Here we provide several natural ensembles
of randomized metabolic networks. A first constraint is to use valid
biochemical reactions. Further constraints correspond to imposing appropriate
functional constraints. We explain how to perform these randomizations with the
help of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and show that they allow one to
approach the properties of biological metabolic networks. The implication of
the present work is that the observed global structural properties of real

of the LMC stellar cluster NGC 1866. NGC 1866 is one of the few young and
massive globular cluster that is close enough so that its stars can be
individually studied in detail. Radial velocities have been used to separate
stars belonging to the cluster and to the LMC field and the same spectra have
been used to derive chemical abundances for a variety of elements, from [Fe/H]
to the light (i.e. Na, O, Mg...) to the heavy ones. The average iron abundance
of NGC 1866 turns out to be [Fe/H]= -0.43+-0.01 dex (with a dispersion of 0.04
dex), from the analysis of 14 cluster-member stars. Within our uncertainties,
the cluster stars are homogeneous, as far as chemical composition is concerned,
independent of the evolutionary status. The observed cluster stars do not show
any sign of the light elements 'anti-correlation' present in all the Galactic
globular clusters so far studied, and also found in the old LMC stellar
clusters. A similar lack of anti-correlations has been detected in the massive
intermediate-age LMC clusters, indicating a different formation/evolution
scenario for the LMC massive clusters younger than ~3 Gyr with respect to the
old ones. Also opposite to the Galactic globulars, the chemical composition of
the older RGB field stars and of the young post-MS cluster stars show robust
homogeneity suggesting a quite similar process of chemical evolution. The field
and cluster abundances are in agreement with recent chemical analysis of LMC
stars, which show a distinctive chemical pattern for this galaxy with respect
to the Milky Way. We discuss these findings in light of the theoretical
scenario of chemical evolution of the LMC.

actual existence of low variance circles in the cosmic microwave background

model - a matter which is not in dispute. We point out two discrepancies
between their treatment and ours, however, one technical, the other having to
do with the very understanding of what constitutes a Gaussian random signal.
Both groups simulate maps using the CMB power spectrum for LCDM, while we
simulate a pure Gaussian sky plus the WMAP's noise, which points out the
contradiction with a common statement [3] that ""CMB signal is random noise of
Gaussian nature"". For as it was shown in [5], the random component is a minor
one in the CMB signal, namely, about 0.2. Accordingly, the circles we saw are a
real structure of the CMB sky and they are not of a random Gaussian nature.
Although the structures studied certainly cannot contradict the power spectrum,
which is well fitted by LCDM model, we particularly emphasize that the low
variance circles occur in concentric families, and this key fact cannot be
explained as a purely random effect. It is, however a clear prediction of
conformal cyclic cosmology.

from April to July 2010 during commissioning time of LHC operations at low

the experimentally observed diffusion coefficients change its behavior from
weakly dependent on $T$ to quite a sensitive function of the temperature. We
also evaluate the off-diagonal (relative to the site labels) distribution

The high-temperature magnetic susceptibility can be interpreted by the S=1/2

at TN=38 K. Although, the resonance field of our high-frequency ESR shows the
typical behavior of the antiferromagnetic resonance, the linewidth of our
high-frequency ESR continues to increase below TN, while it tends to decrease
as the temperature in a conventional three-dimensional antiferromagnet
decreases. In general, a honeycomb lattice antiferromagnet is expected to show
a simple antiferromagnetic order similar to that of a square lattice
antiferromagnet theoretically because both antiferromagnets are bipartite
lattices. However, we suggest that the observed anomalous spin dynamics below
TN is the peculiar feature of the honeycomb lattice antiferromagnet that is not
observed in the square lattice antiferromagnet.

evolution of dense pillars and cometary globules at the boundaries of H II

It is shown, in agreement with previous work, that a strong initial magnetic
field is required to significantly alter the non-magnetised dynamics because
the energy input from photoionisation is so large that it remains the dominant
driver of the dynamics in most situations. Additionally it is found that for
weak and medium field strengths an initially perpendicular field is swept into
alignment with the pillar during its dynamical evolution, matching magnetic
field observations of the `Pillars of Creation' in M16 and also some cometary
globules. A strong perpendicular magnetic field remains in its initial
configuration and also confines the photoevaporation flow into a bar-shaped
dense ionised ribbon which partially shields the ionisation front and would be
readily observable in recombination lines. A simple analytic model is presented
to explain the properties of this bright linear structure. These results show
that magnetic field strengths in star-forming regions can in principle be
significantly constrained by the morphology of structures which form at the

optical emission lines of the filaments in the energetic outflow (""superwind"")
from the nuclear starburst region of M82 are substantially polarized. The
H-alpha polarization degrees and angles measured by our study are consistent
with previous narrowband imaging polarimetry data. The polarized emission lines
are redshifted with respect to the emission lines in the total light and
systemic motion of the galaxy. The emission line intensity ratios [NII]/H-alpha
and [SII]/H-alpha in the polarized light are similar to those of the nuclear
star-forming region. In addition, the electron density N_e derived from
the[SII]6731/6717 line ratio of the polarized light is 600 - 1000 cm^-3 at a
distance of more than 1 kpc from the nucleus, whereas the N_e derived from the
total light are less than 300 cm^-3. These facts strongly suggest that the
emission from the nuclear starburst of M82 is scattered by dust grains
entrained and transported outward by the superwind. A simple hollow biconical
outflow model shows that the velocity of the outflowing dust grains, v_d,
ranges from 100 to 200 km/s near the nucleus, decreases monotonically with the
distance from the nucleus, and reaches about 10 km/s at around 1 kpc. The
motion of the dust is substantially slower than that of both ionized gas (~600
km/s) and molecular gas (~200 km/s) at the same distance from the nucleus of
M82. This indicates that dust grains in the superwind are kinematically
decoupled from both gas components at large radii. Since the dust velocity v_d
is much less than the escape velocity of M82 (~170 km/s at 1.5 kpc from the
nucleus), most of the dust entrained by the superwind cannot escape to
intergalactic space, and may fall back into the galaxy disk without any
additional acceleration mechanisms (such as radiation pressure).

Applied Mathematics",,,,"nlin.PS math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider a spatially inhomogeneous sine-Gordon equation with a
time-periodic drive, modeling a microwave driven long Josephson junction with
phase-shifts. Under appropriate conditions, Josephson junctions with
phase-shifts can have a spatially nonuniform ground state. In recent reports,
it is experimentally shown that a microwave drive can be used to measure the
eigenfrequency of a junction's ground state. Such a microwave spectroscopy is
based on the observation that when the frequency of the applied microwave is in
the vicinity of the natural frequency of the ground state, the junction can
switch to a resistive state, characterized by a non-zero junction voltage. It
was conjectured that the process is analogous to the resonant phenomenon in a
simple pendulum motion driven by a time periodic external force. In the case of
long junctions with phase-shifts, it would be a resonance between the internal
breathing mode of the ground state and the microwave field. Nonetheless, it was
also reported that the microwave power needed to switch the junction into a
resistive state depends on the magnitude of the eigenfrequency to be measured.
Using multiple scale expansions, we show here that an infinitely long Josephson
junction with phase-shifts cannot be switched to a resistive state by microwave
field with frequency close to the system's eigenfrequency, provided that the
applied microwave amplitude is small enough, which confirms the experimental

quasi-one-dimensional Bose gas at finite temperatures and compare different
theoretical approaches. We focus in particular on two stochastic theories: a
number-conserving Bogoliubov (ncB) approach and a stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii
equation (sGPe) that have been extensively used in numerical simulations.
Equilibrium properties like density profiles, correlation functions, and the
condensate statistics are compared to predictions based upon a number of
alternative theories. We find that due to thermal phase fluctuations, and the
corresponding condensate depletion, the ncB approach loses its validity at
relatively low temperatures. This can be attributed to the change in the
Bogoliubov spectrum, as the condensate gets thermally depleted, and to large
fluctuations beyond perturbation theory. Although the two stochastic theories
are built on different thermodynamic ensembles (ncB: canonical, sGPe:
grand-canonical), they yield the correct condensate statistics in a large BEC
(strong enough particle interactions). For smaller systems, the sGPe results
are prone to anomalously large number fluctuations, well-known for the
grand-canonical, ideal Bose gas. Based on the comparison of the above theories
to the modified Popov approach, we propose a simple procedure for approximately
extracting the Penrose-Onsager condensate from first- and second-order
correlation functions that is computationally convenient. This also clarifies
the link between condensate and quasi-condensate in the Popov theory of
low-dimensional systems.

results to three dimensional cosmological simulations has remained unclear. We
show here that the measured exponents characterizing the scale-invariant

in terms of ""halos"" selected with a friend-of-friend algorithm reveals that
such structures are, statistically, virialized across the range of scales
corresponding to scale-invariance. Thus the strongly non-linear clustering in
these models is accurately described as a virialized fractal structure, very
much in line with the ""clustering hierarchy"" which Peebles originally envisaged
qualitatively as associated with stable clustering. If transposed to three
dimensions these results would imply, notably, that cold dark matter halos (or
even subhalos) are 1) not well modeled as smooth objects, and 2) that the
supposed ""universality"" of their profiles is, like apparent smoothness, an
artefact of poor numerical resolution.

self-sustained biochemical oscillations which can be entrained by external
cues, such as light, to the 24-hour cycle induced by Earth rotation. However,
environmental cues are unreliable due to the variability of habitats, weather
conditions or cue-sensing mechanisms among individuals. A tempting hypothesis
is that circadian clocks have evolved so as to be robust to fluctuations in
daylight or other cues when entrained by the day/night cycle. To test this
hypothesis, we analyze the synchronization behavior of weakly and periodically
forced oscillators in terms of their phase response curve (PRC), which measures
phase changes induced by a perturbation applied at different phases. We
establish a general relationship between, on the one side, the robustness of
key entrainment properties such as stability and phase shift and, on the other
side, the shape of the PRC as characterized by a specific curvature or the
existence of a dead zone. This result can be applied to computational models of
circadian clocks where it accounts for the disparate robustness properties of
various forcing schemes. Finally, the analysis of PRCs measured experimentally
in several organisms strongly suggests a case of convergent evolution toward an
optimal strategy for maintaining a clock that is accurate and robust to
environmental fluctuations.

  The second approach features groups acting in a finitely constrained manner
on a regular rooted tree. Automata define sequential permutations of the tree,
and represent the group elements themselves. The choice of particular classes
of automata has often provided groups with exotic behaviour which have
revolutioned our perception of infinite finitely generated groups.

With index",,,,"cs.FL cs.DM math.GR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This text, Chapter 23 in the ""AutoMathA"" handbook, is devoted to the study of
rational subsets of groups, with particular emphasis on the automata-theoretic
approach to finitely generated subgroups of free groups. Indeed, Stallings'
construction, associating a finite inverse automaton with every such subgroup,
inaugurated a complete rewriting of free group algorithmics, with connections
to other fields such as topology or dynamics.
  Another important vector in the chapter is the fundamental Benois' Theorem,
characterizing rational subsets of free groups. The theorem and its
consequences really explain why language theory can be successfully applied to
the study of free groups. Rational subsets of (free) groups can play a major
role in proving statements (a priori unrelated to the notion of rationality) by
induction. The chapter also includes related results for more general classes
of groups, such as virtually free groups or graph groups.

recorded by the satellite DEMETER, during its passing over Haiti before and
after a destructive earthquake. This earthquake occurred on 12/1/2010, at
geographic Latitude 18.46o and Longitude 287.47o, with Magnitude 7.0 R.
Specifically, we are focusing on the variations of energy of Ez-electric field
component concerning a time period of 100 days before and 50 days after the
strong earthquake. In order to study these variations, we developed a novel
method that can be divided in two stages: first we filter the signal keeping
only the very low frequencies and afterwards we eliminate its trend using
techniques of Singular Spectrum Analysis, combined with a third-degree
polynomial filter. As it is shown, a significant increase in energy is observed
for the time interval of 30 days before the strong earthquake. This result
clearly indicates that the change in the energy of ULF electromagnetic waves
could be related to strong precursory earthquake phenomena. Moreover, changes
in energy were also observed 25 days after the strong earthquake associated
with strong aftershock activity. Finally, we present results concerning the
comparison in changes in Energy during night and day passes of the satellite
over Haiti, which showed differences in the mean energy values, but similar
results as far as the rate of energy change is concerned.

volatility uncertainty. To have a mathematical consistent framework we use the

and a risky stock with price process modeled by a geometric G-Brownian motion.
We adapt the notion of arbitrage to this more complex situation and consider
stock price dynamics which exclude arbitrage opportunities. Due to volatility
uncertainty the market is not complete any more. We establish the interval of
no-arbitrage prices for general European contingent claims and deduce explicit
results in a Markovian setting.

essential for the theoretical interpretation of current precision experiments
on the thermal Casimir effect with metallic plates, especially for sub-micron
separations. For this purpose it is necessary to estimate very accurately the
dielectric function of a conductor along the imaginary frequency axis. This
task is complicated in the case of ohmic conductors, because optical data do
not usually extend to sufficiently low frequencies to permit an accurate
evaluation of the standard Kramers-Kronig integral used to compute $\epsilon(i
\xi)$. By making important improvements in the results of a previous paper by
the author, it is shown that this difficulty can be resolved by considering
suitable weighted dispersions relations, which strongly suppress the
contribution of low frequencies. The weighted dispersion formulae presented in
this paper permit to estimate accurately the dielectric function of ohmic
conductors for imaginary frequencies, on the basis of optical data extending
from the IR to the UV, with no need of uncontrolled data extrapolations towards
zero frequency that are instead necessary with standard Kramers-Kronig
relations. Applications to several sets of data for gold films are presented to
demonstrate viability of the new dispersion formulae.

transmission over Gaussian channels with memoryless transceiver distortion,
which encompasses various nonlinear distortion models including transmit-side
clipping, receive-side analog-to-digital conversion, and others. The framework
is based on the so-called generalized mutual information (GMI), and the
analysis in particular benefits from the setup of Gaussian codebook ensemble
and nearest-neighbor decoding, for which it is established that the GMI takes a
general form analogous to the channel capacity of undistorted Gaussian
channels, with a reduced ""effective"" signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) that depends
on the nominal SNR and the distortion model. When applied to specific
distortion models, an array of results of engineering relevance is obtained.
For channels with transmit-side distortion only, it is shown that a
conventional approach, which treats the distorted signal as the sum of the
original signal part and a uncorrelated distortion part, achieves the GMI. For
channels with output quantization, closed-form expressions are obtained for the
effective SNR and the GMI, and related optimization problems are formulated and
solved for quantizer design. Finally, super-Nyquist sampling is analyzed within
the general framework, and it is shown that sampling beyond the Nyquist rate
increases the GMI for all SNR. For example, with a binary symmetric output
quantization, information rates exceeding one bit per channel use are
achievable by sampling the output at four times the Nyquist rate.
