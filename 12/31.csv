central Gaussian impurity. We test how well the resulting inhomogeneity effects
beyond spherical jellium are reproduced by several approximations of density
functional theory (DFT). Four rungs of Perdew's ladder of DFT functionals,
namely local density approximation (LDA), generalized gradient approximation
(GGA), meta-GGA and orbital-dependent hybrid functionals are compared against
our quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) benchmarks. We identify several distinct
transitions in the ground state of the system as the electronic occupation
changes between delocalized and localized states. We examine the parameter
space of realistic densities ($1 \le r_s\le 5$) and moderate depths of the
Gaussian impurity ($Z<7$). The selected 18 electron system (with closed-shell
ground state) presents $1d \to 2s$ transitions while the 30 electron system
(with open-shell ground state) exhibits $1f \to 2p$ transitions. For the former
system, the accuracy for the transitions is clearly improving with increasing
sophistication of functionals with meta-GGA and hybrid functionals having only
small deviations from QMC. However, for the latter system, we find much larger
differences for the underlying transitions between our pool of DFT functionals
and QMC. We attribute this failure to treatment of the exact exchange within
these functionals. Additionally, we amplify the inhomogeneity effects by
creating the system with spherical shell which leads to even larger errors in
DFT approximations.

which permits to solve the Fermi sign problem in the following respects (i) the
nodal surface is known, permitting exact calculations (ii) evaluation of

system, thus allowing simulation of a large number of fermions. Due to the
mapping the energy and local properties in one-dimensional Coulomb systems are
exactly the same for Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac statistics. The exact ground
state energy has been calculated in homogeneous and trapped geometries by using
the diffusion Monte Carlo method. We show that in the low-density Wigner
crystal limit an elementary low-lying excitation is a plasmon, which is to be
contrasted with the large-density ideal Fermi gas/Tonks-Girardeau limit, where
low lying excitations are phonons. Exact density profiles are confronted to the
ones calculated within the local density approximation which predicts a change
from a semicircular to inverted parabolic shape of the density profile as the
value of the charge is increased.

several properties of the minimal fillings, describe minimal fillings of

the former used for the initial approximation to v_x and the latter - for
increments of ES and OS due to subsequent changes of v_x. Thus, solution of the
differential equations for OS, used by Kummel and Perdew (KP) [Phys. Rev. Lett.

terms of ES and OS, is improved by modifying ES at odd iteration steps and OS
at even steps. The modification formulas are related to the OEP equation
(satisfied at convergence) written as the condition of vanishing density shift
(DS) - they are obtained, respectively, by enforcing its satisfaction through
corrections to approximate OS and by determining optimal ES that minimize the
DS norm. The proposed method, successfully tested for several closed-(sub)shell

efficient. The calculations using pseudospectral method for representing

is to understand the role of density perturbations of various scales in the

with the full power spectrum of perturbations, and with spectrum cut at long
wavelengths. Additionally, we have one model, where we cut the intermediate
waves. We analyze the density field and study the void sizes and density field
clusters in different models. Our analysis shows that the fine structure
(groups and clusters of galaxies) is created by small-scale density
perturbations of scale $\leq 8$ \Mpc. Filaments of galaxies and clusters are
created by perturbations of intermediate scale from $\sim 8$ to $\sim 32$ \Mpc,
superclusters of galaxies by larger perturbations. We conclude that the scale
of the pattern of the cosmic web is determined by density perturbations of
scale up to $\sim 100$ \Mpc. Larger perturbations do not change the pattern of
the web, but modulate the richness of galaxy systems, and make voids emptier.
The stop of the increase of the scale of the pattern of the cosmic web with
increasing scale of density perturbations can probably be explained as the
freezing of the web at redshift $z\simeq 0.7$.

largest gate. We give examples (even before any change of basis) including
efficient algorithms for certain lattice path problems and an $O(n^{\omega_p})$

spectral lines from 14 different atomic and molecular species were detected.
Based on simultaneous fits to the spectrum of each galaxy, a number of key
molecular line ratios are derived. A simple model which assumes the emission
arises from an ensemble of Milky Way-like Giant Nolecular Cloud cores can
adequately fit the observed line ratios using molecular abundances based on
Galactic molecular cloud cores. Variations seen in some line ratios, such as
13CO/HCN and HCO+/HCN, can be explained if the mean density of the molecular
gas varies from galaxy to galaxy. However, NGC 3690, NGC 4258 and NGC 6240 show
very large HCO+/HCN ratios and require significant abundance enhancement of
HCO+ over HCN, possible due to the proximity to active galactic nucleus
activity. Finally, the mass of dense molecular gas is estimated and we infer
that 25-85 % of the total molecular gas in the central regions of these

comparison to data replication, as they tend to reduce the amount of data
stored in the network and offer increased resilience in the presence of node
failures. The codes perform poorly though, when repair of a failed node is
called for, as they typically require the entire file to be downloaded to
repair a failed node. A new class of erasure codes, termed as regenerating
codes were recently introduced, that do much better in this respect. However,
given the variety of efficient erasure codes available in the literature, there
is considerable interest in the construction of coding schemes that would
enable traditional erasure codes to be used, while retaining the feature that
only a fraction of the data need be downloaded for node repair. In this paper,
we present a simple, yet powerful, framework that does precisely this. Under
this framework, the nodes are partitioned into two 'types' and encoded using
two codes in a manner that reduces the problem of node-repair to that of
erasure-decoding of the constituent codes. Depending upon the choice of the two
codes, the framework can be used to avail one or more of the following
advantages: simultaneous minimization of storage space and repair-bandwidth,
low complexity of operation, fewer disk reads at helper nodes during repair,

compute these minimizers. Identifying the exact minimizers is computationally
expensive. We consider minimization up to a constant factor to circumvent this
limitation. We verify that q-dependent modifications of shrinkage rules provide
closed formulas for such minimizers. Therefore, their computation is extremely
fast. We also introduce a new shrinkage rule which is adapted to q. To support
the theoretical results, the proposed method is applied to Landweber iteration
with shrinkage used at each iteration step. This approach is utilized to solve
the ill-posed problem of analytic ultracentrifugation, a method to determine

over previous approaches to OQS-TDDFT, since with suitable functionals one
could obtain the dissipative open-systems dynamics by simply propagating a set
of Kohn-Sham orbitals as in usual TDDFT. However, the properties and exact
conditions of such open-systems functionals are largely unknown. In the present
article, we examine a simple and exactly-solvable model open quantum system:
one electron in a harmonic well evolving under the Lindblad master equation. We
examine two different representitive limits of the Lindblad equation
(relaxation and pure dephasing) and are able to deduce a number of properties
of the exact OQS-TDDFT functional. Challenges associated with developing
approximate functionals for many-electron open quantum systems are also
discussed.

Telescope (LAT) revealed a power law decay feature of the high energy emission

(probably radiative) external shock. We analyze four GRBs (080916C, 090510,
090902B and 090926A) jointly detected by Fermi LAT and Gamma-ray Burst Monitor
(GBM), which have high quality lightcurves in both instrument energy bands.
Using the MeV prompt emission (GBM) data, we can record the energy output from
the central engine as a function of time. Assuming a constant radiative
efficiency, we are able to track energy accumulation in the external shock
using our internal/external shell model code. By solving for the early
evolution of both an adiabatic and a radiative blastwave, we calculate the high
energy emission lightcurve in the LAT band and compare it with the observed one
for each burst. The late time LAT light curves after T90 can be well fit by the
model. However, due to continuous energy injection into the blastwave during
the prompt emission phase, the early external shock emission cannot account for
the observed GeV flux level. The high energy emission during the prompt phase
(before T90) is most likely a superposition of a gradually enhancing external
shock component and a dominant emission component that is of an internal
origin.

kinetic energy in compressible turbulence is dominated by local interactions.
Locality here means that interactions between disparate scales decay at least
as fast as a power-law function of the scale-disparity ratio. In particular,
our results preclude transfer of kinetic energy from large-scales directly to
dissipation scales, such as into shocks, in the limit of high Reynolds number
turbulence as is commonly believed. The results hold in broad generality, at
any Mach number, for any equation of state, and without the requirement of
homogeneity or isotropy. The assumptions we make in our proofs on the scaling
of velocity, pressure, and density structure functions are weak and enjoy
compelling empirical support. Under a stronger assumption on pressure
dilatation co-spectrum, we show that \emph{mean} kinetic and internal energy
budgets statistically decouple beyond a transitional ""conversion"" range. Our
analysis demonstrates the existence of an ensuing inertial scale-range over
which mean SGS kinetic energy flux becomes constant, independent of scale. Over
this inertial range, mean kinetic energy cascades locally and in a conservative
fashion, despite not being an invariant.

explicit flux-stabilized compactification, to trace how its properties depend
on the parameters that define the brane-bulk couplings. Both brane tension and
magnetic couplings to the stabilizing flux play an important role in the
resulting dynamics, with the magnetic coupling allowing some of the flux to be
localized on the branes (thus changing the flux-quantization conditions). We
find that back-reaction lifts the classical flat directions of the bulk
supergravity, and we calculate both the scalar potential and changes to the
extra-dimensional and on-brane geometries that result, as functions of the
assumed brane couplings. When linearized about simple rugby-ball geometries the
resulting solutions allow a systematic exploration of the system's response.
Several of the systems we explore have remarkable properties. Among these are a
propensity for the extra dimensions to stabilize at exponentially large sizes,
providing a mechanism for generating extremely large volumes. In some
circumstances the brane-dilaton coupling allows the bulk dilaton to adjust to
suppress the on-brane curvature parametrically below the change in brane
tension, potentially providing a mechanism for reducing the vacuum energy. We
explore the stability of this suppression to quantum effects in the case where
their strength is controlled by the value of the field along the classical flat
direction, and find it can (but need not) be stable.

of line and continuum emission from collisionally excited H2 and emission from
accretion shocks. H2 is the dominant emission in the 1400-1650 A band spectrum
of V4046 Sgr, while an accretion continuum contributes strongly across the
far-ultraviolet spectrum of DF Tau. We compare the spectrum of V4046 Sgr to
models of electron-impact induced H2 emission to constrain the physical
properties of the emitting region, after making corrections for attenuation
within the disk. We find reasonable agreement with the broad spectral
characteristics of the H2 model, implying N(H2) ~ 10^{18} cm^{-2}, T(H2) =
3000^{+1000}_{-500} K, and a characteristic electron energy in the range of ~
50 - 100 eV. We propose that self-absorption and hydrocarbons provide the
dominant attenuation for H2 line photons originating within the disk. For both

reproduce near-UV/optical accretion spectra. We discuss outstanding issues

Deformations are generated by a sequence of vector fields $\{X_2, X_4,...\}$,

induced by rescaling. Constructing recursively the vector fields $X_{2k}$ one
obtains two types of relations involving their unknown coefficients: one set of

that the set of linear relations has a geometric meaning: using
Miura-quasitriviality the set of linear relations expresses the tangency of the
vector fields $X_{2k}$ to the symplectic leaves of $\omega_1$ and this tangency
condition is equivalent to the exactness of the pencil $\omega_{\lambda}$.
Moreover, extending the results of [17], we construct the non trivial

unobstructed and that both Poisson structures are polynomial in the derivatives

modes, which are mutually independent, uncoupled simple harmonic oscillators,
and the equation of motion of such a system linearly maps into a Schroedinger

simple harmonic oscillator frequencies as its diagonal entries. Therefore if
the coupling-strength matrix of such an oscillatory system is presented in

real-valued classical Klein-Gordon equation and the source-free Maxwell
equations, which results in relativistic Hamiltonian operators that are
strictly compatible with the correspondence principle. Once such an oscillatory
classical system has been mapped into a Schroedinger equation, it is
automatically in canonical form, making second quantization of that

  Exchange",,,,,"q-fin.ST","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper examines the validity of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) on
the Ugandan stock market using monthly stock returns from 10 of the 11
companies listed on the Uganda Stock Exchange (USE), for the period 1st March
2007 to 10th November 2009. Due to the absence of readily available Uganda
Stock Exchange(USE) data, and the placement of daily price lists in pdf only,
on the USE website: http://www.use.or.ug, the article also discusses the
procedures taken to mine the data needed. The securities were all put in one
portfolio in order to diversify away the firm-specific part of returns thereby
enhancing the precision of the beta estimates. This paper should be of interest
to both Ugandan and non-Ugandan investors and market researchers. While many
developing countries have legal restrictions against foreign participation in
capital and money markets, this is not so in Uganda, where it has become part
of government policy to encourage foreign capital in flow, inorder to stimulate
the development of the small and underdeveloped markets.
  The Black, Jensen, and Scholes (1972) CAPM version is examined in this
article. This version predicts a non zero-beta rate, along with the relation of
higher returns to higher risk. The estimated zero-beta rate obtained is not
statistically different from zero, and the estimated portfolio beta coefficient
is statistically significant, providing evidence that the traditional form of
CAPM holds on the USE, albeit having a beta coefficient that is not good at
explaining the relationship between risk and return.

viable models consistent with local gravity constraints under a chameleon

Dvali-Gabadazde-Porrati braneworld model can be compatible with local gravity
constraints through a nonlinear field self-interaction arising from a
brane-bending mode, but the self-accelerating solution contains a ghost mode in
addition to the tension with observational data about the cosmic expansion
history. The extension of the field self-interaction to more general forms
satisfying a Galilean symmetry in the flat space-time allows a possibility to
avoid the appearance of ghosts and Laplacian instabilities, while the late-time
cosmic acceleration can be realized by the field kinetic energy. We study the
evolution of cosmological perturbations in those models to place constraints on
model parameters from the observations of large-scale structure, cosmic
microwave background, and weak lensing. We also briefly review other modified

broadening of the maser emission line and its velocity offset are consistent
with a group of masers associated with a quasar jet. If the maser group is
microlensed we can probe its structure and size by observing its microlensing
behaviour over time. We present results of a high resolution numerical analysis
of microlensing of the maser in MG 0414+0534, using several physically

Time-varying spectra of the microlensed maser are generated, displayed, and
analysed, and the behaviour of the different models compared. The observed
maser line in MG 0414+0534 is consistent with maser spots as in other quasar
jets, provided substructure is de-magnified or currently lost in noise;
otherwise smooth extended maser models are also candidates to generate the
observed spectrum. Using measures of spectral variability we find that if the
maser has small substructure of ~ 0.002 pc then a variation of 0.12 mag in flux
and 2.0 km/s in velocity centroid of the maser line could be observed within 2
decades. For the smallest maser model in this study a magnification of > 35 is

  Maximization","30 pages, 3 tables, and 9 figures",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Transmit power control in wireless networks has long been recognized as an
effective mechanism to mitigate co-channel interference. Due to the highly
non-convex nature, optimal power control is known to be difficult to achieve if
a system utility is to be maximized. To date, there does not yet exist a
distributed power control algorithm that maximizes any form of system utility,
despite the importance of distributed implementation for the wireless
infrastructureless networks such as ad hoc and sensor networks. This paper
fills this gap by developing a Gibbs Sampling based Asynchronous distributed
power control algorithm (referred to as GLAD). The proposed algorithm quickly
converges to the global optimal solution regardless of the concavity,
continuity, differentiability and monotonicity of the utility function. Same as
other existing distributed power control algorithms, GLAD requires extensive
message passing among all users in the network, which leads to high signaling
overhead and high processing complexity. To address this issue, this paper
further proposes a variant of the GLAD algorithm, referred to as I-GLAD, where
the prefix ""I"" stands for infrequent message passing. The convergence of I-GLAD
can be proved regardless of the reduction in the message passing rate. To
further reduce the processing complexity at each transmitter, we develop an
enhanced version of I-GLAD, referred to as NI-GLAD, where only the control
messages from the neighboring links are processed. Our simulation results show
that I-GLAD approximately converges to the global optimal solution regardless
of the type of the system utility function. Meanwhile, the optimality of the
solution obtained by NI-GLAD depends on the selection of the neighborhood size.

simultaneously controlling $n$ qubits with four-level quantum systems in a
cavity or coupled to a resonator. Each of the $n$ two-qubit controlled-phase
(CP) gates involved in this multiqubit phase gate has a shared control qubit
but a {\it different} target qubit. In this propose, the two lowest levels of
each system represent the two logical states of a qubit while the two
higher-energy intermediate levels are used for the gate implementation. The
method presented here operates essentially by creating a single photon through
the control qubit, which then induces a phase shift to the state of each target
qubit. The phase shifts on each target qubit can be adjusted by changing the
Rabi frequencies of the pulses applied to the target qubit systems. The
operation time for the gate implementation is independent of the number of
qubits, and neither adjustment of the qubit level spacings nor adjustment of
the cavity mode frequency during the gate operation is required by this
proposal. It is also noted that this approach can be applied to implement
certain types of significant multiqubit phase gates, e.g., the multiqubit phase
gate consisting of $n$ two-qubit CP gates which are key elements in quantum
Fourier transforms. A possible physical implementation of our approach is
presented. Our proposal is quite general, and can be applied to physical
systems such as various types of superconducting devices coupled to a resonator
and trapped atoms in a cavity.

one-dimensional chain with long-range links. Shortcuts are added to a chain by
connecting $pL$ different pairs of sites selected randomly where $L$ and $p$
denote the chain length and the shortcut density, respectively. Particles flow
into a chain at one boundary at rate $\alpha$ and out of a chain at the other
boundary at rate $\beta$, while they hop inside a chain via nearest-neighbor
bonds and long-range shortcuts. Without shortcuts, the model reduces to the
boundary-driven ASEP in a one-dimensional chain which displays the low density,
high density, and maximal current phases. Shortcuts lead to a drastic change.
Numerical simulation studies suggest that there emerge three phases; an empty
phase with $ \rho = 0 $, a jammed phase with $ \rho = 1 $, and a shock phase
with $ 0<\rho<1$ where $\rho$ is the mean particle density. The shock phase is
characterized with a phase separation between an empty region and a jammed
region with a localized shock between them. The mechanism for the shock
formation and the non-equilibrium phase transition is explained by an analytic
theory based on a mean-field approximation and an annealed approximation.

Spectra of random networks, with completely uncorrelated entries show a
circular distribution with delocalized eigenvectors, where as networks with
correlated entries have localized eigenvectors. In order to understand the
origin of localization we track the spectra as a function of connection
probability and directionality. As connections are made directed, eigenstates
start occurring in complex conjugate pairs and the eigenvalue distribution
combined with the localization measure shows a rich pattern. Moreover, for a
very well distinguished community structure, the whole spectrum is localized
except few eigenstates at boundary of the circular distribution. As the network
deviates from the community structure there is a sudden change in the
localization property for a very small value of deformation from the perfect
community structure. We search for this effect for the whole range of
correlation strengths and for different community configurations. Furthermore,
we investigate spectral properties of a metabolic network of zebrafish, and
compare them with those of the model networks.

from a strictly one-dimensional to a quasi-one-dimensional electron liquid,
that is controlled by the dimensionless parameter $n x_0$, where $n$ is the
electron density and $x_0$ is the characteristic length of the transverse
confining potential. If this transition occurs in the low-density limit, it can
be understood as the deformation of the one-dimensional Wigner crystal to a
zigzag arrangement of the electrons described by an Ising order parameter. The
critical properties are governed by the charge degrees of freedom and the spin
sector remains essentially decoupled. At large densities, on the other hand,
the transition is triggered by the filling of a second one-dimensional subband
of transverse quantization. Electrons at the bottom of the second subband
interact strongly due to the diverging density of states and become
impenetrable. We argue that this stabilizes the electron liquid as it
suppresses pair-tunneling processes between the subbands that would otherwise
lead to an instability. However, the impenetrable electrons in the second band
are screened by the excitations of the first subband, so that the transition is
identified as a Lifshitz transition of impenetrable polarons. We discuss the
resulting phase diagram as a function of $n x_0$.

a large number of tiny, low-cost, light-weight wireless nodes deployed to
monitor an environment or a system. Each node in a WSN consists of three
subsystems: the sensor subsystem which senses the environment, the processing
subsystem which performs local computations on the sensed data, and the
communication subsystem which is responsible for message exchange with
neighboring sensor nodes. While an individual sensor node has limited sensing
region, processing power, and energy, networking a large number of sensor nodes
give rise to a robust, reliable, and accurate sensor network covering a wide
region. Thus, routing in WSNs is a very important issue. This paper presents a
query-based routing protocol for a WSN that provides different levels of
Quality of Service (QoS): energy-efficiency, reliability, low latency and
fault-tolerance-under different application scenarios. The algorithm has low
computational complexity but can dynamically guarantee different QoS support
depending on the requirement of the applications. The novelty of the proposed
algorithm is its ability to provide multiple QoS support without
reconfiguration and redeployment of the sensor nodes. The algorithm is
implemented in network simulator ns-2 and its performance has been evaluated.
The results show that the algorithm is more efficient than some of the

differences between type 1 and type 2 Seyfert galaxies are solely due to the
differing orientations of the toroidal-shaped obscuring material around AGN.
The observed X-ray spectra of Seyfert type 2s compared to type 1s are expected
to be affected by higher absorbing column density due to the edge-on view of
the obscuring torus. We study the 0.5 - 10 keV X-ray spectral properties of
Seyfert type 1s and type 2s with the aim to test the predictions of Seyfert
unification scheme in the X-ray regime. Methods: We use an optically selected
Seyfert sample in which type 1s and type 2s have matched distributions in the
orientation independent parameters of AGN and host galaxy. Results: The 0.5 -
10 keV XMM-Newton pn X-ray spectra of Seyfert galaxies are in general best
fitted with a model consists of an absorbed power-law, a narrow Gaussian fitted
to the Fe K{\alpha} emission line and an often seen soft excess component
characterized by either a thermal plasma model with temperature kT \sim 0.1 -
1.0 keV and/or a steep power-law. The 2.0 - 10 keV hard X-ray continuum
emission in several Seyfert type 2s is reflection dominated and suggests the
Compton-thick obscuration. Results on the statistical comparison of the
distributions of the observed X-ray luminosities in the soft (0.5 - 2.0 keV)
and hard (2.0 - 10.0 keV) bands, the X-ray absorbing column densities, the
equivalent widths of Fe K{\alpha} line and the flux ratios of hard X-ray to
[OIII] {\lambda}5007{\AA} for the two Seyfert subtypes are consistent with the

It
is likely that still unresolved fraction of the XRB is composed from a
population of the weak sources below the present detection thresholds and a
truly diffuse component. It is a matter of discussion a nature of these weak
sources. The goal of the present paper is to explore the effectiveness of the
nearest neighbor statistics (NNST) of the photon distribution for the
investigation of the number counts of the very weak sources. All the sources
generating at least two counts each induce a nonrandom distribution of counts.
This distribution is analyzed by means of the NNST. Using the basic probability
equations, the relationships between the source number counts N(S) and the NNST
are derived. It is shown that the method yields constraints on the N(S)
relationship below the regular discrete source detection threshold. The NNST
was applied to the medium deep Chandra pointing to assess the source counts
N(S) at flux levels attainable only with the very deep exposures. The results
are in good agreement with the direct source counts based in the Chandra Deep
Fields (CDF). In the next paper of this series the NNST will be applied to the
the CDF to assess the source counts below the present flux limits.
