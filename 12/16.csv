root-first applications of rules in an appropriate sequent calculus, preferably
without the redundancies generated by permutation of rules. This paper
addresses the issues of defining such sequent calculi for Pure Type Systems
(PTS, which were originally presented in natural deduction style) and then
organizing their rules for effective proof-search. We introduce the idea of
Pure Type Sequent Calculus with meta-variables (PTSCalpha), by enriching the
syntax of a permutation-free sequent calculus for propositional logic due to
Herbelin, which is strongly related to natural deduction and already well
adapted to proof-search. The operational semantics is adapted from Herbelin's
and is defined by a system of local rewrite rules as in cut-elimination, using
explicit substitutions. We prove confluence for this system. Restricting our
attention to PTSC, a type system for the ground terms of this system, we obtain
the Subject Reduction property and show that each PTSC is logically equivalent
to its corresponding PTS, and the former is strongly normalising iff the latter
is. We show how to make the logical rules of PTSC into a syntax-directed system
PS for proof-search, by incorporating the conversion rules as in
syntax-directed presentations of the PTS rules for type-checking. Finally, we
consider how to use the explicitly scoped meta-variables of PTSCalpha to
represent partial proof-terms, and use them to analyse interactive proof
construction. This sets up a framework PE in which we are able to study
proof-search strategies, type inhabitant enumeration and (higher-order)
unification.

these directions. On that account, we have conducted an optical polarization
survey to 878 stars from the Hipparcos catalogue. Our results suggest that the
structure is highly twisted and fragmented, showing very discrepant distances
along the annular region: approximately 100 pc to the left side and 250 pc to
the right side, independently confirming the indication from a previous
photometric analysis. In addition, the polarization vectors' orientation
pattern along the ring also shows a widely different behavior toward both sides
of the studied feature, running parallel to the ring contour in the left side
and showing no relation to its direction in the right side. Altogether, these
evidence suggest a highly irregular nature, casting some doubt on the existence
of a unique large-scale ring-like structure.

INTEGRAL (20-500 keV) and FERMI (0.1-300 GeV) data collected almost
simultaneously during the flare. Methods. We divide the available data into
three different sets, corresponding to the pre-flare period, the flare, and the
subsequent quiescence. For each period, we perform timing and spectral analyses
to differentiate between the contributions of the pulsar and from the
surrounding nebula to the gamma-ray luminosity. Results. No significant
variations in the pulse profile and spectral characteristics are detected in
the hard X-ray domain. In contrast, we identify three separate enhancements in
the gamma-ray flux lasting for about 12 hours and separated by an interval of
about two days from each other. The spectral analysis shows that the flux
enhancement, confined below ~ 1 GeV, can be modelled by a power-law with a high
energy exponential cut-off, where either the cut-off energy or the model
normalization increased by a factor of ~ 5 relative to the pre-flare emission.
We also confirm that the gamma-ray flare is not pulsed. Conclusions. The timing
and spectral analysis indicate that the gamma-ray flare is due to synchrotron
emission from a very compact Pevatron located in the region of interaction
between the pulsar wind and the surrounding nebula. These are the highest
electron energies ever measured in a cosmic accelerator. The spectral
properties of the flare are interpreted in the framework of a relativistically
moving emitter and/or a harder emitting electron population.

mainly discuss the common physical and mathematical features of several exactly
solvable statistical models which describe the nuclear liquid-gas phase
transition and the deconfinement phase transition. Luckily, in some cases it
was possible to rigorously extend the solutions found in thermodynamic limit to
finite volumes and to formulate the finite volume analogs of phases directly
from the grand canonical partition. It turns out that finite volume (surface)
of a system generates also the temporal constraints, i.e. the finite
formation/decay time of possible states in this finite system. Among other
results I would like to mention the calculation of upper and lower bounds for
the surface entropy of physical clusters within the Hills and Dales model;
evaluation of the second virial coefficient which accounts for the Lorentz
contraction of the hard core repulsing potential between hadrons; inclusion of
large width of heavy quark-gluon bags into statistical description. I believe
that the suggested mathematical solution of the freeze-out problem in
relativistic hydrodynamic model and in hydro-cascade model has not only an
academic interest, but also has some practical value. In addition I hope that
the experience gained in working out some partly successful signals of
deconfinement transition can be useful for other researchers to go further in

linear ordering (M,<) characterizes kappa. It is known that if kappa is
characterizable, then kappa plus is characterizable by a linear ordering. Also,
if kappa is characterizable by a dense linear ordering with an increasing
sequence of size kappa, then 2^kappa is characterizable. We show that if kappa
is homogeneously characterizable, then kappa is characterizable by a dense
linear ordering, while the converse fails.
  The main theorems are: 1) If kappa>2^lambda is a characterizable cardinal,
lambda is characterizable by a dense linear ordering and lambda is the least
cardinal such that kappa^lambda>kappa, then kappa^lambda is also
characterizable, 2) if aleph_alpha and kappa^(aleph_alpha) are characterizable
cardinals, then the same is true for kappa^(aleph_(alpha+beta)), for all

kappa^(aleph_beta) is characterizable. Also if kappa is a characterizable

a grid of models (Robitaille et al. 2007) to derive luminosities, masses and
evolutionary phase (Stage I-III). The higher resolution HST images reveal that
~70% of the YSO candidates are either multiples or protoclusters. For YSOs and

use the YSO mass function to derive a present-day star-formation rate of

examine the influence of variability in this current system upon the global

chains and demonstrate that they exhibit a pronounced non-collinear ground
state in a large range of interatomic distances between atoms in the chain. By
artificially varying the atomic number of Mn we investigate how the magnetic
ground state is influenced by alloying the Mn chains with Fe and Cr. With
increasing number of 3d-electrons we find a smooth transition in the magnetic
phase space starting from an antiferromagnetic state for pure Cr chains through
a regime of non-collinear ground states for Mn-rich chains to a ferromagnetic
solution approaching the limit of pure Fe chains. Second, we investigate the
magnetism in supported Mn chains on the (110)-surfaces of Cu, Pd, and Ag. We
show that even a weak chain-surface hybridization is sufficient to dramatically
change the magnetic coupling in the chain. Nevertheless, while we observe that
Mn chains are antiferromagnetic on Pd(110), a weak non-collinear magnetic order

kinematics in galaxies and to build stellar population models. An accurate
knowledge of the spectral resolution of these libraries is critical to avoid
propagation errors and uncertain estimates of the intrinsic stellar velocity
dispersion of galaxies. In this research note we re-assess the spectral
resolution of the MILES stellar library and of the stellar population models
based on it. This exercise was performed, because of a recent controversy over
the exact MILES resolution. We perform our test through the comparison of MILES
stellar spectra with three different sets of higher-resolution templates, one
fully theoretical - the MARCS library - and two empirical ones, namely the
Indo-U.S. and ELODIE v3.1 libraries. The theoretical template has a
well-defined very high (R=20000) resolution. Hence errors on this theoretical
value do not affect our conclusions. Our approach based on the MARCS library
was crucial to constrain the values of the resolution also for the other two
empirical templates. We find that the MILES resolution has previously been
slightly overestimated. We derive a new spectral resolution of 2.54 A FWHM,
instead of the nominal 2.3 A. The reason for this difference is due to an
overestimation of the resolution for the Indo-U.S. library that was previously
used for estimates of the MILES resolution. For the Indo-U.S. we obtain a new
value of 1.35 A FWHM. Most importantly, the results derived from the MARCS and
ELODIE libraries are in very good agreement. These results are important for
users of the MILES spectra library and for further development of stellar
population models aimed to obtain accurate stellar kinematics in galaxies.

to the activatory effects of adrenaline, and subsequent inhibition by calcium,
suggest capability for a turnover, associated with cyclic changes in membrane
potential and participation in a short term-memory pathway.In the cell, the
neurotransmitter by activating AC generates intracellular cyclic AMP. Calcium
entrance in the cell inhibits the enzyme. The increment of cyclic AMP activates
kinaseA and their protein phosphorylating activity, allowing a long term memory
pathway. Hence, consolidating neuronal circuits, related to emotional learning
and memory affirmation.The activatory effect relates to an enzyme-noradrenaline
complex which may participate on the physiology of the fight or flight
response, by prolonged exposure. However, the persistence of an unstable enzyme
complex turns the enzyme inactive. Effect concordant, with the observation that
prolonged exposure to adrenaline, participate in the etiology of stress

hormones could be modulated by the concentration of Chelating Metabolites.
These ones produce the release of free ATP4-, a negative modulator of AC and
the Mg2+ activated insulin receptor tyrosine kinase (IRTK). Thus, allowing an
integration of the hormonal response of both enzymes by ionic controls. This

\emph{$q$-ary} Johnson bound. This difference is important when $q$ is very
small. Essentially, the most favourable case is $q=2$, for which the decoding
radius is greatly improved, notably when the relative minimum distance gets
close to 1/2. Even though the announced result, which is the list-decoding
radius of binary Goppa codes, is new, it can be rather easily made up from
previous sources (V. Guruswami, R. M. Roth and I. Tal, R .M. Roth), which may
be a little bit unknown, and in which the case of binary Goppa codes has
apparently not been thought at. Only D. J. Bernstein treats the case of binary

ratios of up to $1\times10^5$), open flow boundary conditions (pressure driven
flows), and large scale domains in two dimensions. Numerical experiments are
performed to show the degree to which mass conservation is violated when a flow
field computed using either element is used as the advection velocity in a

shows considerable mass production or loss for problems that involve flow
tangential to layers of differing permeability, but marginal violation of local
mass balance for problems of less orthogonality in the permeability. The
results are useful in establishing rudimentary estimates of the error produced

different photometric bands, galaxy populations, galaxy positions within the
groups, and the group surrounding large scale density. We find that M*
brightens and alpha becomes steeper as a function of mass in all SDSS
photometric bands, in agreement with previous results. From the analysis of
different galaxy populations, we observe that different methods to split galaxy
populations, based on the concentration index or the colour-magnitude diagram,
produce quite different behaviours in the luminosity trends, mainly for alpha.
These discrepancies and the trends with mass mentioned above are explained when
analysing the LF of galaxies classified simultaneously according to their
concentrations and colours. We find that only the red spheroids have a LF that
strongly depends on group mass. Late type galaxies, whether blue or red, have
luminosity functions that do not depend on group mass. The intrinsic change in
the LF of spheroids and the varying number contributions of the different types
explain all the observed trends with group mass. On the other hand, dividing
the galaxy members in the inner and outer regions of the groups do not
introduce a significant difference in the Schechter parameter trends, except
for the characteristic absolute magnitude in the high group virial mass range
(M>1x10^13 M_sun/h) which is an indication of luminosity segregation in massive
groups. Finally, we also analyse the possible influence of the large scale
surrounding environment on the LF. We find that galaxies inhabiting groups at
low density regions experience more pronounced variations on the Schechter
parameters as a function of groups mass, while galaxies in groups at high
density regions show an almost constant behaviour.

very long runs in order to compensate for the accumulation of numerical errors

compared to the standard energy-conserving Newtonian NVE dynamics by
simulations of the Kob-Andersen binary Lennard-Jones liquid, its WCA version
(i.e., with cut-off's at the pair potential minima), and the Gaussian
Lennard-Jones liquid. We find identical results for all quantities probed:
radial distribution functions, incoherent intermediate scattering functions,
and mean-square displacement as function of time. Arguments are then presented
for the equivalence of NVU and NVE dynamics in the thermodynamic limit; in
particular to leading order in 1/N these two dynamics give identical
time-autocorrelation functions. In the final section NVU dynamics is compared
to Monte Carlo dynamics, to a diffusive dynamics of small-step random walks on
the constant-potential-energy hypersurface, and to Nose-Hoover NVT dynamics. If
time is scaled for the two stochastic dynamics to make their single-particle
diffusion constants identical to those of NVE dynamics, the simulations show
that all five dynamics are equivalent at low temperatures except at short
times.

pressed by buoyancy against a planar water-hexadecane interface. It was
confirmed that small drops (ri<10 {\mu}m) stabilized with {\beta}-casein behave
as nondeformable particles, moving with a combination of Stokes and Taylor
tensors as they approach the interface. Here, a similar methodology is used to
parametrize the potential of interaction of drops of soybean oil stabilized
with bovine serum albumin. The potential obtained is then employed to study the
lifetime of deformable drops in the range 10 \leq ri \leq 1000 {\mu}m. It is
established that the average lifetime of these drops can be adequately
replicated using the model of truncated spheres. However, the results depend
sensibly on the expressions of the initial distance of deformation and the
maximum film radius used in the calculations. The set of equations adequate for
large drops is not satisfactory for medium-size drops (10 \leq ri \leq 100
{\mu}m), and vice versa. In the case of large particles, the increase in the
interfacial area as a consequence of the deformation of the drops generates a
very large repulsive barrier which opposes coalescence. Nevertheless, the
buoyancy force prevails. As a consequence, it is the hydrodynamic tensor of the
drops which determine the characteristic behavior of the lifetime as a function
of the particle size. While the average values of the coalescence time of the
drops can be justified by the mechanism of film thinning, the scattering of the
experimental data of large drops cannot be rationalized using the methodology
previously described. A possible explanation of this phenomenon required
elaborate simulations which combine deformable drops, capillary waves,
repulsive interaction forces, and a time-dependent surfactant adsorption.

enough mass to be gravitationally unstable, at such radii. We perform radiative
hydrodynamic simulations and show that even a disc with mass 0.25 Msun and size
100 AU fragments. The disc mass, radius, and the ratio of disc-to-star mass
(Mdisc/Mstar~0.36) are smaller than in previous studies. We find that
fragmenting discs decrease in mass and size within a few 10^4 yr of their
formation, since a fraction of their mass, especially outside 100 AU is
consumed by the new stars and brown dwarfs that form. Fragmenting discs end up
with masses ~0.001-0.1 Msun, and sizes ~20-100 AU. On the other hand, discs
that are marginally stable live much longer. We produce simulated images of
fragmenting discs and find that observing discs that are undergoing
fragmentation is possible using current (e.g. IRAM-PdBI) and future (e.g. ALMA)
interferometers, but highly improbable due to the short duration of this
process. Comparison with observations shows that many observed discs may be
remnants of discs that have fragmented at an earlier stage. However, there are
only a few candidates that are possibly massive and large enough to currently
be gravitationally unstable. The rarity of massive (>0.2 Msun), extended (>100
AU) discs indicates either that such discs are highly transient (i.e. form,
increase in mass becoming gravitationally unstable due to infall of material
from the surrounding envelope, and quickly fragment), or that their formation
is suppressed (e.g. by magnetic fields). We conclude that current observations
of early-stage discs cannot exclude the mechanism of disc fragmentation.

eight C stars with large mid-IR continuum fluxes: V384 Per, CIT 6, V Hya, Y
CVn, IRAS 15194-5115, V Cyg, S Cep, and IRC+40540. This survey, performed using
the HIFI instrument on board the Herschel Space Observatory, entailed
observations of the lowest transitions of both ortho- and para-water: the
556.936 GHz 1(10)-1(01) and 1113.343 GHz 1(11)-0(00) transitions, respectively.
Water vapor was unequivocally detected in all eight of the target stars. Prior
to this survey, IRC+10216 was the only carbon-rich AGB star from which thermal
water emissions had been discovered, in that case with the use of the
Submillimeter Wave Astronomy Satellite (SWAS). Our results indicate that
IRC+10216 is not unusual, except insofar as its proximity to Earth leads to a
large line flux that was detectable with SWAS. The water spectral line widths
are typically similar to those of CO rotational lines, arguing against the
vaporization of a Kuiper belt analog (Ford & Neufeld 2001) being the general
explanation for water vapor in carbon-rich AGB stars. There is no apparent
correlation between the ratio of the integrated water line fluxes to the 6.3
micron continuum flux - a ratio which measures the water outflow rate - and the
total mass-loss rate for the stars in our sample.

Object X) in the nearby galaxy M33. Although multi-wavelength data on this
object have existed in the literature for some time, it has not previously been
recognized as the most luminous mid-IR object in M33 because it is entirely
unremarkable in both optical and near-IR light. In the Local Group Galaxies
Survey, Object X is a faint red source visible in VRI and H-alpha but not U or
B. It was easily seen at JHK_s in the 2MASS survey. It is the brightest point
source in all four Spitzer IRAC bands and is also visible in the MIPS 24-micron
band. Its bolometric luminosity is 5x10^5 L_sun. The source is optically
variable on short time scales (tens of days) and is also slightly variable in
the mid-IR, indicating that it is a star. Archival photographic plates (from
1949 and 1991) show no optical source, so the star has been obscured for at
least half a century. Its properties are similar to those of the Galactic OH/IR
star IRC+10420 which has a complex dusty circumstellar structure resulting from
episodic low velocity mass ejections. We propose that Object X is a M>30 M_sun
evolved star obscured in its own dust ejected during episodic mass loss events
over at least half a century. It may emerge from its current ultra-short
evolutionary phase as a hotter post-RSG star analogous to M33 Var A. The
existence and rarity of such objects can be an important probe of a very brief
yet eventful stellar evolutionary phase.

has a low gas-phase oxygen abundance (12 + log(O/H) = 8.2), which reinforces
the emerging trend that over-luminous core-collapse supernovae are found in the
low-metallicity tail of the galaxy distribution, similar to the known trend for
the hosts of long GRBs. We compile oxygen abundances from the literature and
from our own observations of UGC 5189, and we present an unpublished spectrum
of the luminous type Ic SN 2010gx that we use to estimate its host metallicity.
We discuss these in the context of host metallicity trends for different
classes of core-collapse objects. The earliest generations of stars are known
to be enhanced in [O/Fe] relative to the Solar mixture; it is therefore likely
that the stellar progenitors of these overluminous supernovae are even more
iron-poor than they are oxygen-poor. A number of mechanisms and massive star
progenitor systems have been proposed to explain the most luminous
core-collapse supernovae; any successful theory will need to include the
emerging trend that points towards low-metallicity for the massive progenitor
stars. This trend for very luminous supernovae to strongly prefer
low-metallicity galaxies should be taken into account when considering various

dependence of the three-point correlation function (3PCF) in both redshift and
projected space, utilizing measurements of spectroscopic galaxies in the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Main Galaxy Sample. We show that bright galaxies (M_r
< -21.5) are biased tracers of mass, measured at a significance of 4.5 sigma in
redshift space and 2.5 sigma in projected space by using a thorough error
analysis in the quasi-linear regime (9-27 Mpc/h). Measurements on a fainter
galaxy sample are consistent with an unbiased model. We demonstrate that a
linear bias model appears sufficient to explain the galaxy-mass bias of our
samples, although a model using both linear and quadratic terms results in a
better fit. In contrast, the bias values obtained from the linear model appear
in better agreement with the data by inspection of the relative bias, and yield
implied values of sigma_8 that are more consistent with current constraints. We
investigate the covariance of the 3PCF, which itself is a measurement of galaxy
clustering. We assess the accuracy of our error estimates by comparing results
from mock galaxy catalogs to jackknife re-sampling methods. We identify
significant differences in the structure of the covariance. However, the impact
of these discrepancies appears to be mitigated by an eigenmode analysis that
can account for the noisy, unresolved modes. Our results demonstrate that using
this technique is sufficient to remove potential systematics even when using
less-than-ideal methods to estimate errors.

donors with the strong acceptor tetracyanoquinodimethane (TMPx/HMPx - TCNQy)
were grown from solution via vapour diffusion in different stoichiometries x:y
= 1:1, 1:2 and 2:1. Owing to the element specificity of NEXAFS, the oxygen and
nitrogen K-edge spectra are direct spectroscopic fingerprints of the donating
and accepting moieties. The orbital selectivity of the NEXAFS resonances allows
to precisely elucidate the participation of specific orbitals in the
charge-transfer process. In the present case charge is transferred from
methoxy-orbitals 2e (PI*) and 6a1 (SIGMA*) to the cyano-orbitals b3g and au
(PI*) and - to a weaker extent - to b1g and b2u (SIGMA*). The occupation of 2e
reflects the anionic character of the methoxy groups. Surprisingly, the charge
transfer increases with increasing HMP content of the complex. As additional
indirect signature, all spectral features of the donor and acceptor are shifted
to higher and lower photon energies, respectively. Providing quantitative
access to the relative occupation of specific orbitals, the approach
constitutes the most direct probe of the charge-transfer mechanism in organic
salts found so far. Although demonstrated for the specific example of
pyrene-derived donors with the classical acceptor TCNQ, the method is very
versatile and can serve as routine probe for novel CT-complexes on the basis of

galaxies over the redshift range 0.1<~z<~1. The primary aim is to build a
statistically complete, large (~10^4) sample of clusters, covering a
sufficiently long redshift baseline to be able to place constraints on
cosmological parameters via the evolution of the cluster mass function. Other
main science goals include building a large sample of high surface brightness,
strongly gravitationally-lensed arcs associated with these clusters, and an
unprecedented sample of several tens of thousands of galaxy clusters and
groups, spanning a large range of halo mass, with which to study the properties
and evolution of their member galaxies.
  This paper describes the design of the survey and the methodology for
acquiring, reducing and calibrating the data for the production of
high-precision photometric catalogs. We describe the method for calibrating our
griz imaging data using the colors of the stellar locus and overlapping
Two-Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS) photometry. This yields an absolute accuracy
of <0.03 mag on any color and ~0.05 mag in the r-band magnitude, verified with
respect to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). RCS-2 reaches average 5 sigma
point source limiting magnitudes of griz = [24.4, 24.3, 23.7, 22.8],
approximately 1-2 magnitudes deeper than the SDSS. Due to the queue-scheduled
nature of the observations, the data are highly uniform and taken in excellent
seeing, mostly FWHM<~0.7"" in the r-band. In addition to the main science goals
just described, these data form the basis for a number of other planned and

Newton-Wigner position operator as it is non-local and non-covariant. An
alternative bilinear covariant position operator is discussed which
incorporates a time operator that can be exponentiated to a unitary operator.
Moreover, it satisfies an algebra that unifies special relativity and quantum

planets, secular interactions may lead to chaos. The innermost planet may
gradually become very eccentric and/or inclined, as a result of the secular
degrees of freedom drifting towards equipartition of angular momentum deficit.
Secular chaos is known to be responsible for the eventual destabilization of
Mercury in our own Solar System. Here we focus on systems with three giant
planets. We characterize the secular chaos and demonstrate the criterion for it
to occur, but leave a detailed understanding of secular chaos to a companion
paper (Lithwick & Wu, 2010). After an extended period of eccentricity
diffusion, the inner planet's pericentre can approach the star to within a few
stellar radii. Strong tidal interactions and ensuing tidal dissipation extracts
orbital energy from the planet and pulls it inward, creating a hot Jupiter. In
contrast to other proposed channels for the production of hot Jupiters, such a
scenario (which we term ""secular migration"") explains a range of observations:
the pile-up of hot Jupiters at 3-day orbital periods, the fact that hot
Jupiters are in general less massive than other RV planets, that they may have
misaligned inclinations with respect to stellar spin, and that they have few
easily detectable companions (but may have giant companions in distant orbits).
Secular migration can also explain close-in planets as low in mass as Neptune;
and an aborted secular migration can explain the ""warm Jupiters"" at
intermediate distances. In addition, the frequency of hot Jupiters formed via
secular migration increases with stellar age. We further suggest that secular
chaos may be responsible for the observed eccentricities of giant planets at
larger distances, and that these planets could exhibit significant spin-orbit
misalignment.

of Stochastic Maximum Likelihood (SML-PT) helps address the issue, it imposes a
trade-off between computational complexity and high ergodicity, and requires
careful hand-tuning of the temperatures. In this paper, we show that this
trade-off is unnecessary. The choice of optimal temperatures can be automated
by minimizing average return time (a concept first proposed by [Katzgraber et

propose a method to recover the information on small-scales by allowing cosmic

marginalize over all possible power spectra using path integrals. Information
is still recoverable in these nonlinear regimes from the geometric part of weak

nonlinear matter power spectrum needs to be accurately known to 1% down to k=50

significant theoretical challenge to understand baryonic effects on the scale
of galaxy haloes. However self-calibration from weak lensing may also provide

transitional and pre-transitional objects which contain holes and gaps in their
disks. We detect variability between 5-38 microns in all but two of our objects
on timescales of 2-3 years. Most of the variability observed can be classified
as seesaw behavior, whereby the emission at shorter wavelengths varies
inversely with the emission at longer wavelengths. For many of the objects we
can reasonably reproduce the observed variability using irradiated disk models,
particularly by changing the height of the inner disk wall by ~20%. When the
inner wall is taller, the emission at the shorter wavelengths is higher since
the inner wall dominates the emission at 2-8 microns. The taller inner wall
casts a larger shadow on the outer disk wall, leading to less emission at
wavelengths beyond 20 microns where the outer wall dominates. We discuss how
the possible presence of planets in these disks could lead to warps which cause
changes in the height of the inner wall. We also find that crystalline
silicates are common in the outer disks of our objects and that in the four
disks in the sample with the most crystalline silicates, variability on
timescales of 1 week is present. In addition to explaining the infrared
variability described above, planets can create shocks and collisions which can
crystallize the dust and lead to short timescale variability.

We assume a random sampling process from data which provide information with
bias and are interested in the fraction of information we expect to learn as
function of (i) the sampled fraction (recall) and (ii) varying bias of
information (redundancy distributions). We develop two rules of thumb with
varying robustness. We first show that, when information bias follows a Zipf
distribution, the 80-20 rule or Pareto principle does surprisingly not hold,
and we rather expect to learn less than 40% of the information when randomly
sampling 20% of the overall data. We then analytically prove that for large
data sets, randomized sampling from power-law distributions leads to ""truncated
distributions"" with the same power-law exponent. This second rule is very
robust and also holds for distributions that deviate substantially from a
strict power law. We further give one particular family of powerlaw functions
that remain completely invariant under sampling. Finally, we validate our model
with two large Web data sets: link distributions to domains and tag
distributions on delicious.com.

account uncertainties in the boundary data and using improved methods for
merging multiple-instrument data. The solution demonstrates the
""self-consistency"" procedure of Wheatland & Regnier (2009), for the first time
including uncertainties. The self-consistency procedure addresses the problem
that photospheric vector magnetogram data are inconsistent with the force-free
model, and in particular that the boundary conditions on vertical electric
current density are over-specified and permit the construction of two different
nonlinear force-free solutions. The procedure modifies the boundary conditions
on current density during a sequence of cycles until the two nonlinear
force-free solutions agree. It hence constructs an accurate single solution to
the force-free model, with boundary values close, but not matched exactly, to
the vector magnetogram data. The inclusion of uncertainties preserves the
boundary conditions more closely at points with smaller uncertainties. The
self-consistent solution obtained for active region AR 10953 is significantly
non-potential, with magnetic energy E/E_0 = 1.08, where E_0 is the energy of
the reference potential (current-free) magnetic field. The self-consistent
solution is shown to be robust against changes in the details of the
construction of the two force-free models at each cycle. This suggests that
reliable nonlinear force-free modeling of active regions is possible if
uncertainties in vector magnetogram boundary data are included.

$\|f\|_{U^k([N])}$ defined for functions on a discrete interval $[N] :=
\{1,...,N\}$, are of importance in the modern theory of counting additive
patterns (such as arithmetic progressions) inside large sets. Closely related
to these norms are the \emph{Gowers-Host-Kra seminorms} $\|f\|_{U^k(X)}$ of a
measurable function $f: X \to \C$ on a measure-preserving system $X = (X,
{\mathcal X}, \mu, T)$. Much recent effort has been devoted to the question of
obtaining necessary and sufficient conditions for these Gowers norms to have
non-trivial size (e.g. at least $\eta$ for some small $\eta > 0$), leading in
particular to the inverse conjecture for the Gowers norms, and to the Host-Kra
classification of characteristic factors for the Gowers-Host-Kra seminorms.
  In this paper we investigate the near-extremal (or ""property testing"")
version of this question, when the Gowers norm or Gowers-Host-Kra seminorm of a
function is almost as large as it can be subject to an $L^\infty$ or $L^p$
bound on its magnitude. Our main results assert, roughly speaking, that this
occurs if and only if $f$ behaves like a polynomial phase, possibly localised
to a subgroup of the domain; this can be viewed as a higher-order analogue of
classical results of Russo and Fournier, and are also related to the
polynomiality testing results over finite fields of Blum-Luby-Rubinfeld and
Alon-Kaufman-Krivelevich-Litsyn-Ron. We investigate the situation further for
the $U^3$ norms, which are associated to 2-step nilsequences, and find that
there is a threshold behaviour, in that non-trivial 2-step nilsequences (not
associated with linear or quadratic phases) only emerge once the $U^3$ norm is
at most $2^{-1/8}$ of the $L^\infty$ norm.

define a graph for each Hecke operator with fixed ramification. A priori, these
graphs can be seen as a convenient language to organize formulas for the action
of Hecke operators on automorphic forms. However, they will prove to be a
powerful tool for explicit calculations and proofs of finite dimensionality
results.
  We develop a structure theory for certain graphs $G_x$ of unramified Hecke
operators, which is of a similar vein to Serre's theory of quotients of Bruhat
Tits trees. To be precise, $G_x$ is locally a quotient of a Bruhat Tits tree
and has finitely many components. An interpretation of $G_x$ in terms of rank 2
bundles on $X$ and methods from reduction theory show that $G_x$ is the union
of finitely many cusps, which are infinite subgraphs of a simple nature, and a
nucleus, which is a finite subgraph that depends heavily on the arithmetics of
$F$.
  We describe how one recovers unramified automorphic forms as functions on the
graphs $G_x$. In the exemplary cases of the cuspidal and the toroidal
condition, we show how a linear condition on functions on $G_x$ leads to a
finite dimensionality result. In particular, we re-obtain the
finite-dimensionality of the space of unramified cusp forms and the space of
unramified toroidal automorphic forms.
  In an Appendix, we calculate a variety of examples of graphs over rational
function fields.

groups recovered from a sample of M-giants from 2MASS with those found in
synthetic surveys of simulated $\Lambda$CDM stellar halos and demonstrate broad
consistency. We also find that these recovered groups are likely to represent
the majority of high-luminosity ($\log(L/L_{Sun})>6.67$) satellites accreted
within the last 10 Gyr and on orbits with apocenters within 100 kpc. However
the sensitivity of the M-giant survey to accretion events that were either
ancient, from low-luminosity objects or those on radial orbits is limited
because of the low number of stars, bias towards high-metallicity stars and the
shallow depth. We examine the extent to which these limitations are addressed
by current and future surveys, in particular catalogues of main-sequence
turn-off (MSTO) stars from SDSS and LSST, and of RR-Lyrae stars from LSST or
PanSTARRS. The MSTO surveys are more sensitive to low-luminosity events
($\log(L/L_{Sun}~5$ or less) than the 2MASS M-giant sample, while the RR-Lyrae
surveys, with superior depth, are good at detecting events on highly eccentric
orbits. When combined we expect these photometric surveys to provide a
comprehensive picture of the last 10 Gyr of Galactic accretion. Events older
than this are too phase mixed to be discovered and would require additional
information such as velocity and chemical abundance.

at 327 MHz with predictions of scattering models that incorporate refractive
index effects, inner scale effects and a spherically diverging wavefront. We
use an empirical prescription for the turbulence amplitude $C_{N}^{2}(R)$ based
on VLBI observations by Spangler and coworkers of compact radio sources against
the solar wind for heliocentric distances $R \approx$ 10--50 $R_{\odot}$. We
use the Coles & Harmon model for the inner scale $l_{i}(R)$, that is presumed
to arise from cyclotron damping. In view of the prevalent uncertainty in the
power law index that characterizes solar wind turbulence at various
heliocentric distances, we retain this index as a free parameter. We find that
the inclusion of spherical divergence effects suppresses the predicted source
size substantially. We also find that inner scale effects significantly reduce
the predicted source size. An important general finding for solar sources is
that the calculations substantially underpredict the observed source size.
Three possible, non-exclusive, interpretations of this general result are
proposed. First and simplest, future observations with better angular
resolution will detect much smaller sources. Consistent with this, previous
observations of small sources in the corona at metric wavelengths are limited
by the instrument resolution. Second, the spatially-varying level of turbulence
$C_{N}^{2}(R)$ is much larger in the inner corona than predicted by
straightforward extrapolation Sunwards of the empirical prescription, which was
based on observations between 10--50 $R_{\odot}$. Either the functional form or
the constant of proportionality could be different. Third, perhaps the inner
scale is smaller than the model, leading to increased scattering.

erroneous result, in the regime of finite numbers of copies $N$, and in the

optimal collective measurements over all copies, locally optimal local

local measurements, locally optimal adaptive local measurements, and globally
optimal adaptive local measurements. Here, adaptive measurements are those for
which the measurement basis can depend on prior measurement results. For each
of these measurement schemes we determine the probability of error (for finite
$N$) and scaling of this error in the asymptotic limit. In the asymptotic
limit, adaptive schemes have no advantage over the optimal fixed local scheme,
and except for states with less than 2% mixture, the most naive scheme (locally
optimal fixed local measurements) is as good as any noncollective scheme. For
finite $N$, however, the most sophisticated local scheme (globally optimal
adaptive local measurements) is better than any other noncollective scheme, for

We also derive related quantities involving an energy dependence: the moments
of the Wigner delay times and the density of states of chaotic Andreev
billiards, where we find that the gap in the density persists when subleading
corrections are included. Finally, we show how to adapt our techniques to
non-linear statistics by calculating the correlation between transport moments.
In each setting, the answer for the $n$-th moment is obtained for arbitrary $n$

gates that alleviate such shortcomings. They are able to work with non-squeezed
logic values where both the high and low values are encoded into nonzero,
bipolar, independent random telegraph waves. Non-squeezed universal Boolean
logic gates for spike-based brain logic are also shown. The advantages vs.

properties to arbitrary quantum systems. We begin by noting that a
particle-like state is represented by a spatially-localized wave function and
its narrow probability density is displaced by spatial translations. In
contrast a wave-like state is represented by a spatially-delocalized wave
function and the corresponding broad position probability density is invariant
to spatial translations. The wave-particle dichotomy can therefore be seen as a
competition between displacement and invariance of the state with respect to
spatial translations. We generalize this dichotomy to arbitrary quantum systems
with finite dimensional Hilbert spaces as follows. We use arbitrary finite
symmetry groups to represent transformations of the quantum system. The
symmetry (i.e. invariance) or asymmetry (i.e. displacement) of a given state
with respect to transformations of the group are identified with the
generalized wave and particle nature, respectively. We adopt a measure of wave
and particle properties based on the amount of information that can be encoded
in the symmetric and asymmetric parts of the state.

scenario) simple dynamical model of the dark energy or cosmological constant.
Concretely, we suggest a Lagrangian dependent of Universe scale factor and
scalar field (with constant and positive total energy density as cosmological
constant). Then, Euler-Lagrange equation for Universe scale factor is
equivalent to the second Friedman equation for the flat empty space with
cosmological constant (in this sense our model is full agreement with recent
astronomical observations). Also there is Euler-Lagrange equation for scalar
field that includes additional ""friction"" term and negative first partial
derivative of unknown potential energy density (this equation is, in some way,
similar to Klein-Gordon equation modified for cosmic expansion in Linde chaotic
inflation scenario). Finally, total time derivative of the (constant) scalar
field total energy density must be zero. It implies third dynamical equation
which is equivalent to usual Euler-Lagrange equation with positive partial
derivative of unknown potential energy density (this equation is formally
exactly equivalent to corresponding equation in static Universe). Last two
equations admit simple exact determination of scalar field and potential energy
density, while cosmological constant stands a ""free parameter"". Potential
energy density represents a square function of scalar field with unique maximum
(dynamically non-stable point). Any initial scalar field tends
(co-exponentially) during time toward the same final scalar field, argument of
the maximum of the potential energy density. It admits a possibility that final
dynamically non-stable scalar field value turns out spontaneously in any other
scalar field value when all begins again (like Sisyphus boulder motion).

two candidate populations are distinguishable on the basis of their genetic
structure. Examples include populations which are geographically separated,
case--control studies and quality control (when participants in a study have
been genotyped at different laboratories). This latter application is of
particular importance in the era of large scale genome wide association
studies, when collections of individuals genotyped at different locations are
being merged to provide increased power. The traditional method for detecting
structure within a population is some form of exploratory technique such as
principal components analysis. Such methods, which do not utilise our prior
knowledge of the membership of the candidate populations. are termed
\emph{unsupervised}. Supervised methods, on the other hand are able to utilise
this prior knowledge when it is available.
  In this paper we demonstrate that in such cases modern supervised approaches
are a more appropriate tool for detecting genetic differences between
populations. We apply two such methods, (neural networks and support vector
machines) to the classification of three populations (two from Scotland and one
from Bulgaria). The sensitivity exhibited by both these methods is considerably
higher than that attained by principal components analysis and in fact
comfortably exceeds a recently conjectured theoretical limit on the sensitivity
of unsupervised methods. In particular, our methods can distinguish between the
two Scottish populations, where principal components analysis cannot. We
suggest, on the basis of our results that a supervised learning approach should
be the method of choice when classifying individuals into pre-defined
populations, particularly in quality control for large scale genome wide
association studies.

collimated nature of synchrotron radiation produced by a circling quark, which
was recently studied in Phys.Rev.D81 (2010) 126001. The gravitational dual of
such quark is a coiling string in AdS, whose backreaction on the spacetime
geometry remains tightly confined, as if 'beamed' towards the boundary. While
this appears to contradict conventional expectations from the scale/radius
duality, we resolve the issue by observing that the backreaction of a
relativistic string is reproduced by a superposition of gravitational shock
waves. We further demonstrate that this proposal allows us to reduce the
problem of computing the boundary stress tensor to merely calculating geodesics
in AdS, as opposed to solving linearized Einstein's equations.

multi-copy LOCC (MCLOCC) and multi-copy SLOCC (MCSLOCC). We show that two
transformable multipartite states under LOCC or SLOCC are also transformable
under MCLOCC and MCSLOCC. What's more, these two environments are equivalent in
the sense that two transformable states under MCLOCC are also transformable
under MCSLOCC, and vice versa. Based on these environments we classify the
multipartite pure states into a few inequivalent sets and orbits, between which
we build the partial order to decide their transformation. In particular, we
investigate the structure of SLOCC-equivalent states in terms of tensor rank,
which is known as the generalized Schmidt rank. Given the tensor rank, we show
that GHZ states can be used to generate all states with a smaller or equivalent
tensor rank under SLOCC, and all reduced separable states with a cardinality
smaller or equivalent than the tensor rank under LOCC. Using these concepts, we
extended the concept of ""maximally entangled state"" in the multi-partite

occur at order $v^2/c^2$. While solar radiation can be used to propel the solar
sail, the absorbed portion of it also gives rise to a drag force in the
tangential direction. For escape trajectories, this diminishes the cruising
velocity, which can have a cumulative effect on the heliocentric distance. For
a solar sail directly facing the sun in a bound orbit, the Poynting-Robertson
effect decreases its orbital speed, thereby causing it to slowly spiral towards
the sun. We also consider this effect for non-Keplerian orbits in which the
solar sail is tilted in the azimuthal direction. While in principle the drag
force could be counter-balanced by an extremely small tilt of the solar sail in
the polar direction, periodic adjustments are more feasible.

  2010), p. 49",,,"cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The spin dynamics and spin relaxation of itinerant electrons in quantum wires
with spin-orbit coupling is reviewed. We give an introduction to spin dynamics,
and review spin-orbit coupling mechanisms in semiconductors. The spin diffusion
equation with spin-orbit coupling is derived, using only intuitive, classical
random walk arguments. We give an overview of all spin relaxation mechanisms,
with particular emphasis on the motional narrowing mechanism in disordered
conductors, the D'yakonov-Perel'-Spin relaxation. Here, we discuss in
particular, the existence of persistent spin helix solutions of the spin
diffusion equation, with vanishing spin relaxation rates. We then, derive
solutions of the spin diffusion equation in quantum wires, and show that there
is an effective alignment of the spin-orbit field in wires whose width is
smaller than the spin precession length $L_{\rm SO}$. We show that the
resulting reduction in the spin relaxation rate results in a change in the sign
of the quantum corrections to the conductivity. Finally, we present recent
experimental results which confirm the decrease of the spin relaxation rate in
wires whose width is smaller than $L_{\rm SO}$: the direct optical measurement
of the spin relaxation rate, as well as transport measurements, which show a
dimensional crossover from weak antilocalization to weak localization as the
wire width is reduced. Open problems remain, in particular in narrower,
ballistic wires, were optical and transport measurements seem to find opposite
behavior of the spin relaxation rate: enhancement, suppression, respectively.
We conclude with a review of these and other open problems which still
challenge the theoretical understanding and modeling of the experimental
results.

Our analysis for 10 M>6 EQs from November 23 to December 28, 2004 suggests a

The two giant EQs during this period occurred after the two fastest geomagnetic

discussed, based on the dynamics of the gradient of potential vorticity ($q =
\bom\cdot\nabla\theta$) associated with solutions of the three-dimensional
Euler and Navier-Stokes equations. The vector $\bdB = \nabla q \times
\nabla\theta$ satisfies the same type of stretching and folding equation as
that for the vorticity field $\bom $ in the incompressible Euler equations
(Gibbon & Holm, 2010). The quantity $\theta$ may be chosen as the potential
temperature for the stratified, rotating Euler/Navier-Stokes equations, or it
may play the role of a seeded passive scalar for the Euler equations alone. The
first discussion of these S&F-flow diagnostics concerns a numerical test for
Euler codes and also includes a connection with the two-dimensional surface
quasi-geostrophic equations. The second S&F-flow diagnostic concerns the
evolution of the Lamb vector $\bsD = \bom\times\bu$, which is the nonlinearity
for Euler's equations apart from the pressure. The curl of the Lamb vector
($\boldsymbol{\varpi} := \bsD$) turns out to possess similar stretching and
folding properties to that of the $\bdB$-vector.

of patchy colloids, using Wertheim's first order perturbation theory and a
generalization of Flory-Stockmayer's theory of polymerization. The colloids are
modelled as hard spheres with the same diameter and surface patches of the same
type, $A$. The only difference between species is the number of their patches
-or functionality-, $f_A^{(1)}$ and $f_A^{(2)}$ (with $f_A^{(2)}>f_A^{(1)}$).
We have found that the difference in functionality is the key factor
controlling the behaviour of the mixture in the network (percolated) fluid
regime. In particular, when $f_A^{(2)}\ge2f_A^{(1)}$ the entropy of bonding
drives the phase separation of two network fluids which is absent in other
mixtures. This changes drastically the critical properties of the system and
drives a change in the topology of the phase diagram (from type I to type V)
when $f_A^{(1)}>2$. The difference in functionality also determines the
miscibility at high (osmotic) pressures. If $f_A^{(2)}-f_A^{(1)}=1$ the mixture
is completely miscible at high pressures, while closed miscibility gaps at
pressures above the highest critical pressure of the pure fluids are present if
$f_A^{(2)}-f_A^{(1)}>1$. We argue that this phase behaviour is driven by a
competition between the entropy of mixing and the entropy of bonding, as the
latter dominates in the network fluid regime.

the near-field regime exhibit quite different nature from those in the
far-field free space. A coupled state of an electromagnetic field with an
electric or magnetic dipole-carrying excitation is well known as a polariton.
Such a state is the result of the mixing of a photon with an excitation of a
material. The most discussed types of polaritons are phonon-polaritons,
exciton-polaritons, and surface plasmon-polaritons. Recently, it was shown that
in microwaves strong magnon-photon coupling can be achieved due to
magnetic-dipolar-mode (MDM) vortices in small thin-film ferrite disks. These
coupled states can be specified as MDM-vortex polaritons. In this paper we
study properties of MDM-vortex polaritons. We show that MDM-vortex polaritons
are characterized by helicity behaviors. For the observed frequency splits of
MDM resonances there are different-type helicities. In the split-resonance
states one has or localization, or cloaking of electromagnetic fields. We
analyze numerically a variety of the field topological structures of MDM-vortex
polaritons and give theoretical insights into the possible origin of such
topologically distinctive states. The shown properties of MDM-vortex polaritons
can be useful for realization of novel microwave metamaterial structures and
near-field sensing applications.

pattern repertoire of ongoing and stimulus-evoked activity using Shannon
entropy. Next, we quantified the efficacy of information transmission between

ratio of excitation/inhibition (E/I) in vitro and in a network model, we
discovered that both information capacity and information transmission are
maximized at a particular intermediate E/I, at which ongoing activity emerges
as neuronal avalanches. Next, we used our in vitro and model results to
correctly predict in vivo information capacity and interactions between

BioSystems; B\'okkon and D'Angiulli, 2009. Bioscience Hypotheses). Namely, the
retina transforms external photon signals into electrical signals that are
carried to the V1 (striate cortex). Then, V1 retinotopic electrical signals
(spike-related electrical signals along classical axonal-dendritic pathways)
can be converted into regulated ultraweak bioluminescent photons (biophotons)
through redox processes within retinotopic visual neurons that make it possible
to create intrinsic biophysical pictures during visual perception and imagery.
However, the consensus opinion is to consider biophotons as by-products of
cellular metabolism. This paper argues that biophotons are not by-products,
other than originating from regulated cellular radical/redox processes. It also
shows that the biophoton intensity can be considerably higher inside cells than
outside. Our simple calculations, within a level of accuracy, suggest that the
real biophoton intensity in retinotopic neurons may be sufficient for creating
intrinsic biophysical picture representation of a single-object image during
visual perception.

Also presented is a novel mathematical model of the tag signal, incorporating
the allowed variations in frequency and delay. The main motivation is seen in
the observation that random variations in frequency and delay make the collided
signals of different tags separable. The collision recovery is done by
estimating the sensor specific variation in frequency and delay and using these
estimates in a successive interference cancellation algorithm and a maximum
likelihood sequence decoder, to iteratively reconstruct a sensor signal and
remove it from the received signal. Numerical simulations show that the
estimates and proposed algorithm are effective in recovering collisions. The
proposed algorithm is then incorporated into a numerical simulation of the

localization of the electrons transforming an otherwise metallic system into an

disorder can induce a dramatic transition from a superconducting into an
insulating state. An outstanding question is whether the route to insulating
behavior proceeds via the direct localization of Cooper pairs or,
alternatively, by a two-step process in which the Cooper pairing is first
destroyed followed by the standard localization of single electrons. Here we
address this question by studying the local superconducting gap of a highly
disordered, amorphous, superconductor by means of scanning tunneling
spectroscopy. Our measurements reveal that, in the vicinity of the
superconductor-insulator transition, the coherence peaks in the one-particle
density of states disappear while the superconducting gap remains intact
indicating the presence of localized Cooper pairs. Our results provide the
first direct evidence that the transition in our system is driven by Cooper
pair localization.

structures can give hints about the functional organization of the network as a
whole. However, these structural motifs can only tell one part of the
functional story because in this analysis each node and edge is treated on an
equal footing. In real networks, two motifs that are topologically identical
but whose nodes perform very different functions will play very different roles
in the network. Here, we combine structural information derived from the
topology of the neuronal network of the nematode C. elegans with information
about the biological function of these nodes, thus coloring nodes by function.
We discover that particular colorations of motifs are significantly more
abundant in the worm brain than expected by chance, and have particular
computational functions that emphasize the feed-forward structure of
information processing in the network, while evading feedback loops.
Interneurons are strongly over-represented among the common motifs, supporting
the notion that these motifs process and transduce the information from the
sensor neurons towards the muscles. Some of the most common motifs identified
in the search for significant colored motifs play a crucial role in the system
of neurons controlling the worm's locomotion. The analysis of complex networks
in terms of colored motifs combines two independent data sets to generate
insight about these networks that cannot be obtained with either data set
alone. The method is general and should allow a decomposition of any complex
network into its functional (rather than topological) motifs as long as both
wiring and functional information is available.

near the period limit. Another quarter comprise a variety of different systems
all likely to contain coronally active stars. The remaining 9 X-ray-bright
stars are an intriguing group that appears redward of the red giant branch,
with several lying along the anomalous RGB. Future spectroscopic observations
should reveal whether these stars are in fact related to the anomalous RGB, or
whether they instead represent a large group of ""sub-subgiants"" such as have
been seen in smaller numbers in other globular and open clusters.

because of the observed cyclical variability in their UV wind-lines. However,
direct detections of these magnetic fields using optical spectropolarimetry
have proven to be very difficult. Aims: Non-thermal radio emission in these
objects would most likely be due to synchrotron radiation. As a magnetic field
is required for the production of synchrotron radiation, this would be strong
evidence for the presence of a magnetic field. Such non-thermal emission has
already been observed from the strongly magnetic Ap/Bp stars. Methods: We have
performed 6 & 21 cm observations using the WSRT and use these, in combination
with archival VLA data at 3.6 cm and results from the literature, to study the
radio emission of 5 selected candidate magnetic O stars. Results: Out of our
five targets, we have detected three: $\xi$ Per, which shows a non-thermal
radio spectrum, and $\alpha$ Cam and $\lambda$ Cep, which show no evidence of a
non-thermal spectrum. In general we find that the observed free-free (thermal)
flux of the stellar wind is lower than expected. This is in agreement with
recent findings that the mass-loss rates from O stars as derived from the
H$\alpha$ line are overestimated because of clumping in the inner part of the
stellar wind.

(~150-300 M) may end their life as pair-instability supernovae (PISN) if they
retain enough mass until they die. We have calculated a grid of stellar
evolution models in order to investigate the impact of mass loss and rotation
on the evolution and fate of these very massive stars. As mass loss is very
strong at solar metallicity, our models predict that most of the very massive
stars will die as type Ic SNe. Only slowly and non-rotating stars at
metallicities below that of the LMC might retain enough mass to produce a PISN.
This would mean that the first stellar generations might have produced PISN
although their chemical signature is not observed in extremely metal poor stars
in the halo of our galaxy.

molecular junctions. The principles in TVS is to find the minimum on a
Fowler-Nordheim plot where $\ln(I/V^2)$ is plotted against $1/V$ and relate the
voltage at the minimum, $V_{\rm min}$, to the closest molecular level.
Importantly, $V_{\rm min}$, is approximately half the voltage required to see a
peak in the $dI/dV$ curve. Information about the molecular level position can
thus be obtained at relatively low voltages. In this work we show that the
molecular level position can be determined at even lower voltages, $V_{\rm
min}^{(\alpha)}$ by finding the minimum of $\ln(I/V^\alpha)$ with $\alpha<2$.
On the basis of a simple Lorentzian transmission model we analyze theoretical
{\it ab initio} as well as experimental $I-V$ curves and show that the voltage
required to determine the molecular levels can be reduced by $\sim 30%$ as
compared to conventional TVS. As for conventional TVS, the symmetry/asymmetry
of the molecular junction needs to be taken into account in order to gain
quantitative information. We show that the degree of asymmetry may be estimated
from a plot of $V_{\rm min}^{(\alpha)}$ vs. $\alpha$.
