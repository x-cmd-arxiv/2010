  Allocation",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Virtualization technology facilitates a dynamic, demand-driven allocation and
migration of servers. This paper studies how the flexibility offered by network
virtualization can be used to improve Quality-of-Service parameters such as
latency, while taking into account allocation costs. A generic use case is
considered where both the overall demand issued for a certain service (for
example, an SAP application in the cloud, or a gaming application) as well as
the origins of the requests change over time (e.g., due to time zone effects or
due to user mobility), and we present online and optimal offline strategies to
compute the number and location of the servers implementing this service. These
algorithms also allow us to study the fundamental benefits of dynamic resource
allocation compared to static systems. Our simulation results confirm our
expectations that the gain of flexible server allocation is particularly high
in scenarios with moderate dynamics.

the hydrogen atom. According to the Copenhagen school of quantum mechanics, the
proton is sitting in the absolute Lorentz frame. If this hydrogen atom is
observed from a different Lorentz frame, there is a time-like separation
linearly mixed with the Bohr radius. Indeed, the time-separation is one of the
essential variables in high-energy hadronic physics where the hadron is a bound
state of the quarks, while thoroughly hidden in the present form of quantum
mechanics. It will be concluded that this variable is hidden in Feynman's rest
of the universe. It is noted first that Feynman's Lorentz-invariant
differential equation for the bound-state quarks has a set of solutions which
describe all essential features of hadronic physics. These solutions explicitly
depend on the time separation between the quarks. This set also forms the
mathematical basis for two-mode squeezed states in quantum optics, where both
photons are observable, but one of them can be treated a variable hidden in the
rest of the universe. The physics of this two-mode state can then be translated
into the time-separation variable in the quark model. As in the case of the
un-observed photon, the hidden time-separation variable manifests itself as an
increase in entropy and uncertainty.

applications, allowing the determination of meaningful properties (e.g. network
size, total storage capacity, average load, majorities, etc.) that are used to
direct the execution of the system. However, the majority of the existing
aggregation algorithms exhibit relevant dependability issues, when prospecting
their use in real application environments. In this paper, we reveal some
dependability issues of aggregation algorithms based on iterative averaging
techniques, giving some directions to solve them. This class of algorithms is
considered robust (when compared to common tree-based approaches), being
independent from the used routing topology and providing an aggregation result
at all nodes. However, their robustness is strongly challenged and their
correctness often compromised, when changing the assumptions of their working
environment to more realistic ones. The correctness of this class of algorithms
relies on the maintenance of a fundamental invariant, commonly designated as
""mass conservation"". We will argue that this main invariant is often broken in
practical settings, and that additional mechanisms and modifications are
required to maintain it, incurring in some degradation of the algorithms
performance. In particular, we discuss the behavior of three representative
algorithms Push-Sum Protocol, Push-Pull Gossip protocol and Distributed Random
Grouping under asynchronous and faulty (with message loss and node crashes)
environments. More specifically, we propose and evaluate two new versions of
the Push-Pull Gossip protocol, which solve its message interleaving problem
(evidenced even in a synchronous operation mode).

  Symposium and EVN Users Meeting: VLBI and the new generation of radio arrays",,,,"astro-ph.IM astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Hubble constant value is currently known to 10% accuracy unless
assumptions are made for the cosmology (Sandage et al. 2006). Gravitational
lens systems provide another probe of the Hubble constant using time delay
measurements. However, current investigations of ~20 time delay lenses, albeit
of varying levels of sophistication, have resulted in different values of the
Hubble constant ranging from 50-80 km/s/Mpc. In order to reduce uncertainties,
more time delay measurements are essential together with better determined mass
models (Oguri 2007, Saha et al. 2006). We propose a more efficient technique
for measuring time delays which does not require regular monitoring with a
high-resolution interferometer array. The method uses double image and
long-axis quadruple lens systems in which the brighter component varies first
and dominates the total flux density. Monitoring the total flux density with
low-resolution but high sensitivity radio telescopes provides the variation of
the brighter image and is used to trigger high-resolution observations which
can then be used to see the variation in the fainter image. We present
simulations of this method together with a pilot project using the WSRT
(Westerbork Radio Synthesis Telescope) to trigger VLA (Very Large Array)
observations. This new method is promising for measuring time delays because it
uses relatively small amounts of time on high-resolution telescopes. This will
be important because many SKA pathfinder telescopes, such as MeerKAT (Karoo
Array Telescope) and ASKAP (Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder), have
high sensitivity but limited resolution.

radial velocity profile across jets from young stars. The significance of these
results is considerable. They may be interpreted as a signature of jet rotation
about its symmetry axis, thereby representing the only existing observational
indications supporting the theory that jets extract angular momentum from
star-disk systems. However, the possibility that we are indeed observing jet
rotation in pre-main sequence systems is undergoing active debate. To test the
validity of a rotation argument, we must extend the survey to a larger sample,
including younger sources. We present the latest results of a radial velocity
analysis on jets from Class 0 and I sources, using high resolution data from
the infrared spectrograph GNIRS on GEMINI South. We obtained infrared spectra
protostellar jets HH 34, HH 111-H, HH 212 NK1 and SK1. The [Fe II] emission was
unresolved in all cases and so Doppler shifts across the jet width could not be
accessed. The H_2 emission was resolved in all cases except HH 34. Doppler
profiles across the molecular emission were obtained, and gradients in radial
velocity of typically 3 km/s identified. Agreement with previous studies
implies they may be interpreted as jet rotation, leading to toroidal velocity
and angular momentum flux estimates of 1.5 km/s and 1x10^-5 M_odot/yr AU km/s
respectively. However, caution is needed. For example, emission is asymmetric
across the jets from HH 212 suggesting a more complex interpretation is
warranted. Furthermore, observations for HH 212 and HH 111-H are conducted far
from the source implying external influences are more likely to confuse the
intrinsic flow kinematics. These observations demonstrate the difficulty of
conducting this study from the ground, and highlight the necessity for high
angular resolution via adaptive optics or space-based facilities.

modern physics. The universe including this paper and even the reader
him(her)self seems to be built up of ordinary matter only. Theoretically, the
well-known Sakharov's conditions remain the solid framework explaining the
circumstances that matter became dominant against the antimatter while the
universe cools down and/or expands. On the other hand, the standard model for
elementary particles apparently prevents at least two conditions out of them.
In this work, we introduce a systematic study of the antiparticle-to-particle
ratios measured in various $NN$ and $AA$ collisions over the last three
decades. It is obvious that the available experimental facilities turn to be
able to perform nuclear collisions, in which the matter-antimatter asymmetry
raises from $\sim 0%$ at AGS to $\sim 100%$ at LHC. Assuming that the final
state of hadronization in the nuclear collisions takes place along the
freezeout line, which is defined by a constant entropy density, various
antiparticle-to-particle ratios are studied in framework of the hadron
resonance gas (HRG) model. Implementing modified phase space and distribution
function in the grand-canonical ensemble and taking into account the
experimental acceptance, the ratios of antiparticle-to-particle over the whole
range of center-of-mass-energies are very well reproduced by the HRG model.
Furthermore, the antiproton-to-proton ratios measured by ALICE in $pp$
collisions is also very well described by the HRG model. It is likely to
conclude that the LHC heavy-ion program will produce the same particle ratios
as the $pp$ program implying the dynamics and evolution of the system would not
depend on the initial conditions. The ratios of bosons and baryons get very
close to unity indicating that the matter-antimatter asymmetry nearly vanishes
at LHC.

approach this problem both from the perspective of chiral effective field
theory, in which genuine three-body forces generate an effective
density-dependent two-body interaction, as well as from the perspective of
Brown-Rho scaling, in which the masses and form factor cutoffs in
one-boson-exchange interactions are modified in a dense nuclear medium due to
the partial restoration of chiral symmetry. The beta decay transition of 14C to
the ground state of 14N is calculated within the shell model using a model
space consisting of two 0p-shell holes within a closed 16O core. The effective
0p-shell interaction is calculated up to second order in perturbation theory
with single-particle energies extracted from experiment. We find that both
three-nucleon forces and Brown-Rho scaling medium modifications give
qualitatively similar results not only for the ground state to ground state
Gamow-Teller transition but also for Gamow-Teller transitions from excited
states of 14C to the ground state of 14N. In this way, it is observed that at a
low-momentum scale of V_(low-k) = 2.1 fm-1, medium-modifications of the nuclear
force play an essential role in increasing the lifetime of 14C from a few
minutes to an archaeologically long one of 5730 years.

of an arbitrary finite collection of linearly independent reconstruction
vectors, given a finite number of its samples with respect to any Riesz basis.
As we establish, provided the dimension of the reconstruction space is chosen
suitably in relation to the number of samples, this procedure can be
numerically implemented in a stable manner. Moreover, the accuracy of the
resulting approximation is completely determined by the choice of
reconstruction basis, meaning that the reconstruction vectors can be tailored
to the particular problem at hand.
  An important example of this approach is the accurate recovery of a piecewise
analytic function from its first few Fourier coefficients. Whilst the standard
Fourier projection suffers from the Gibbs phenomenon, by reconstructing in a
piecewise polynomial basis, we obtain an approximation with root exponential
accuracy in terms of the number of Fourier samples and exponential accuracy in
terms of the degree of the reconstruction function. Numerical examples
illustrate the advantage of this approach over other existing methods.

Observations were made with the Rossi Timing X-ray Explorer (RXTE) and the Very
Large Array (VLA) at 8.4 and 4.8 GHz. In the X-ray band NGC 4051 behaves much
like a Galactic black hole binary (GBH) system in a `soft-state'. In such
systems, there has so far been no firm evidence for an active, radio-emitting
jet like those found in `hard state' GBHs. VLBI observations of NGC 4051 show
three co-linear compact components. This structure resembles the core and outer
hot spots seen in powerful, jet-dominated, extragalactic radio sources and
suggests the existence of a weak jet.
  Radio monitoring of the core of NGC 4051 is complicated by the presence of
surrounding extended emission and by the changing array configurations of the
VLA. Only in the A configuration is the core reasonably resolved. We have
carefully removed the contaminations of the core by extended emission in the
various arrays. The resulting lightcurve shows no sign of large amplitude
variability (i.e. factor 50 %) over the 16 month period. Within the most
sensitive configuration (A array) we see marginal evidence for radio core
variability of ~25% (~0.12 mJy at 8.4GHz) on a 2-week timescale, correlated
with X-ray variations. Even if the radio variations in NGC 4051 are real, the
percentage variability is much less than in the X-ray band. Within the B
configuration observations, where sensitivity is reduced, there is no sign of
correlated X-ray/radio variability. The lack of radio variability in NGC 4051,
which we commonly see in `hard state' GBHs, may be explained by orientation
effects. Another possibility is that the radio emission arises from the X-ray
corona, although the linear structure of the compact radio components here is
hard to explain.

state information can be beneficial in multiple access channels (MACs).
Specifically, it was proved that the capacity region of a two-user MAC with
independent states, each known strictly causally to one encoder, can be
enlarged by letting the encoders send compressed past state information to the
decoder. In this work, a generalization of the said strategy is proposed
whereby the encoders compress also the past transmitted codewords along with
the past state sequences. The proposed scheme uses a combination of
long-message encoding, compression of the past state sequences and codewords
without binning, and joint decoding over all transmission blocks. The proposed
strategy has been recently shown by Lapidoth and Steinberg to strictly improve
upon the original one. Capacity results are then derived for a class of
channels that include two-user modulo-additive state-dependent MACs. Moreover,
the proposed scheme is extended to state-dependent MACs with an arbitrary
number of users. Finally, output feedback is introduced and an example is
provided to illustrate the interplay between feedback and availability of
strictly causal state information in enlarging the capacity region.

of significant interest in many modern applications. For the problem of

optimization objectives for algorithms searching through sets of graphs or for
selection of tuning parameters of other methods such as the graphical lasso,
which is a likelihood penalization technique. In this paper we establish the
consistency of an extended Bayesian information criterion for Gaussian
graphical models in a scenario where both the number of variables p and the
sample size n grow. Compared to earlier work on the regression case, our
treatment allows for growth in the number of non-zero parameters in the true
model, which is necessary in order to cover connected graphs. We demonstrate
the performance of this criterion on simulated data when used in conjunction
with the graphical lasso, and verify that the criterion indeed performs better
than either cross-validation or the ordinary Bayesian information criterion
when p and the number of non-zero parameters q both scale with n.

count data are common in disease mapping, and binary data are common in

for dependence to ensure reliable inference for the regression coefficients.
The spatial generalized linear mixed model (SGLMM) offers a very popular and
flexible approach to modeling such data, but the SGLMM suffers from three major
shortcomings: (1) uninterpretability of parameters due to spatial confounding,
(2) variance inflation due to spatial confounding, and (3) high-dimensional
spatial random effects that make fully Bayesian inference for such models
computationally challenging. We propose a new parameterization of the SGLMM

representations of depth (disparity) maps. The proposed algorithm relaxes the
usual assumption of the stationary noise model in sparse coding. This enables
learning from data corrupted with spatially varying noise or uncertainty,
typically obtained by laser range scanners or structured light depth cameras.
Sparse representations are learned from the Middlebury database disparity maps
and then exploited in a two-layer graphical model for inferring depth from
stereo, by including a sparsity prior on the learned features. Since they
capture higher-order dependencies in the depth structure, these priors can
complement smoothness priors commonly used in depth inference based on Markov
Random Field (MRF) models. Inference on the proposed graph is achieved using an
alternating iterative optimization technique, where the first layer is solved
using an existing MRF-based stereo matching algorithm, then held fixed as the
second layer is solved using the proposed non-stationary sparse coding
algorithm. This leads to a general method for improving solutions of state of
the art MRF-based depth estimation algorithms. Our experimental results first
show that depth inference using learned representations leads to state of the
art denoising of depth maps obtained from laser range scanners and a time of
flight camera. Furthermore, we show that adding sparse priors improves the
results of two depth estimation methods: the classical graph cut algorithm by
Boykov et al. and the more recent algorithm of Woodford et al.

the learning of Bayesian network structures, which is determining the best
fitting statistical model on the basis of given data. Although there are
learning methods based on statistical conditional independence tests,
contemporary methods are mainly based on maximization of a suitable quality
criterion that evaluates how good the graph explains the occurrence of the
observed data. This leads to a nonlinear combinatorial optimization problem
that is in general NP-hard to solve. In this paper we deal with the complexity
of learning restricted Bayesian network structures, that is, we wish to find
network structures of highest score within a given subset of all possible
network structures. For this, we introduce a new unique algebraic
representative for these structures, called the characteristic imset. We show
that these imsets are always 0-1-vectors and that they have many nice

easily establish new complexity results for learning restricted Bayes network

general two-field inflation and provide a simple geometric recipe for building
observationally allowed models with observable non-Gaussianity. We use the
\delta N formalism and the transfer function formalism to express the
bispectrum almost entirely in terms of model-independent physical quantities.
Similarly, we calculate the trispectrum and show that the trispectrum parameter
\tau NL can be expressed entirely in terms of spectral observables, which
provides a new consistency relation unique to two-field inflation. We show that
in order to generate observably large non-Gaussianity during inflation, the
sourcing of curvature modes by isocurvature modes must be extremely sensitive
to the initial conditions, and that the amount of sourcing must be moderate in
order to avoid excessive fine-tuning. Under some minimal assumptions, we argue
that the first condition is satisfied only when neighboring trajectories
through the two-dimensional field space diverge during inflation.
Geometrically, this means that the inflaton must roll along a ridge in the
potential V for some time during inflation and that its trajectory must turn
slightly (but not too sharply) in field space. Therefore, it follows that
two-field scenarios with attractor solutions necessarily produce small
non-Gaussianity. This explains why it has been so difficult to achieve large
non-Gaussianity in two-field inflation, and why it has only been achieved in a
narrow class of models like hybrid inflation and certain product potentials
where the potential and/or the initial conditions are fine-tuned. Some of our
conclusions generalize qualitatively to general multi-field inflation.

massive stars, but the identity of the central engine remains elusive. Previous
work has shown that rapidly spinning, strongly magnetized proto-neutron stars
(`millisecond proto-magnetars') produce outflows with energies, timescales, and
magnetizations sigma_0 (maximum Lorentz factor) that are consistent with those
required to produce long GRBs. Here we extend this work in order to construct a
self-consistent model that directly connects the properties of the central
engine to the observed prompt emission. Just after the launch of the supernova
shock, a wind heated by neutrinos is driven from the proto-magnetar. The
outflow is collimated into a bipolar jet by its interaction with the star. As
the magnetar cools, the wind becomes ultra-relativistic and Poynting-flux
dominated (sigma_0 >> 1) on a timescale comparable to that required for the jet
to clear a cavity through the star. Although the site and mechanism of the
prompt emission are debated, we calculate the emission predicted by two models:
magnetic dissipation and internal shocks. Our results favor the magnetic
dissipation model in part because it predicts a relatively constant `Band'
spectral peak energy E_peak with time during the GRB. The jet baryon loading
decreases abruptly when the neutron star becomes transparent to neutrinos at t
~ 10-100 seconds. Jets with ultra-high magnetization cannot effectively
accelerate and dissipate their energy, suggesting this transition ends the
prompt emission and may explain the steep decay phase that follows. We assess
several phenomena potentially related to magnetar birth, including low
luminosity GRBs, thermal-rich GRBs/X-ray Flashes, very luminous supernovae, and
short duration GRBs with extended emission.

partial discrepancies recently claimed in a similar study by Li & Barrow
(2010b) with respect to the first outcomes of Baldi et al. (2010), which are

that when linear and nonlinear effects of the interaction between Dark Energy

acceleration is the leading effect acting at nonlinear scales, and in
particular is the most important mechanism in lowering the concentration of

therefore been the target of numerous searches for associated inverse Compton
(IC) emission, particularly at hard X-ray energies where the IC signal must
eventually dominate over thermal emission. The most recent search with the
Suzaku Hard X-ray Detector (HXD) failed to confirm previous IC detections with
RXTE and BeppoSAX, instead setting an upper limit 2.5 times below their
nonthermal flux. However, this discrepancy can be resolved if the IC emission
is very extended, beyond the scale of the cluster radio halo. Using
reconstructed sky images from the 58-month Swift BAT all sky survey, the
feasibility of such a solution is investigated. Building on Renaud et al., we
test and implement a method for extracting the fluxes of extended sources,
assuming specified spatial distributions. BAT spectra are jointly fit with an
XMM-Newton EPIC-pn spectrum derived from mosaic observations. We find no
evidence for large-scale IC emission at the level expected from the previously
detected nonthermal fluxes. For all nonthermal spatial distributions
considered, which span the gamut of physically reasonable IC models, we
determine upper limits for which the largest (most conservative) limit is
<4.2x10^{-12} erg/s/cm^2 (20-80 keV), which corresponds to a lower limit on the
magnetic field B>0.2uG. A nominal flux upper limit of <2.7x10^{-12} erg/s/cm^2,
with corresponding B>0.25uG, is derived for the most probable IC distribution
given the size of the radio halo and likely magnetic field radial profile.

population is known to affect the age inferred from spectral fitting to stellar
population synthesis models. However, most population synthesis models still
rely on theoretical isochrones which do not include realistic modelling of
extended HBs. In this work, we create detailed models for a range of old simple
stellar populations (SSPs), to create a variety of realistic HB morphologies,
from extended red clumps, to extreme blue HBs. We achieve this by utilising
stellar tracks from the BaSTI database and implementing a different mass loss
prescription for each SSP created, resulting in different HB morphologies. We
find that, for each metallicity, there is some HB morphology which maximises
Hbeta, making an underlying 14Gyr population look ~5-6Gyr old for the low and
intermediate metallicity cases, and as young as 2Gyr for a solar metallicity
SSP. We explore whether there are any spectral indices capable of breaking the
degeneracy between an old SSP with extended blue HB and a truly young or
intermediate age SSP, and find that the CaII index of Rose(1984) and the
strength of the MgII doublet at 2800A are promising candidates, in combination
with Hbeta and other metallicity indicators such as Mgb and Fe5406. We also run
Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the level of statistical fluctuations in
the spectra of typical stellar clusters. We find that fluctuations in spectral
indices are significant even for average to large globular clusters, and that
various spectral indices are affected in different ways, which has implications
for full-spectrum fitting methods. Hence we urge caution if these types of
stellar clusters are to be used as empirical calibrating objects for various
aspects of SPS models. (Abridged)

measurements to determine distances to low-redshift Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia).
We consider linear models for predicting distances to SN Ia using light-curve
width and color parameters (determined using the SALT2 light-curve fitter) and
a spectroscopic indicator, and evaluate the resulting Hubble diagram scatter
using a cross-validation procedure. We confirm the ability of spectral flux
ratios alone at maximum light to reduce the scatter of Hubble residuals by ~10%
with respect to the standard combination of light-curve width and color. When
used in combination with the SALT2 color parameter, the color-corrected flux
ratio R^c(6420/5290) at maximum light leads to an even lower scatter, although
the improvement has low statistical significance (<2 sigma) given the size of
our sample (26 SN Ia). We highlight the importance of an accurate relative flux
calibration and the failure of this method for highly-reddened objects.
Comparison with synthetic spectra from 2D delayed-detonation explosion models
shows that the correlation of R(6630/4400) with SN Ia absolute magnitudes can
be largely attributed to intrinsic color variations and not to reddening by
dust in the host galaxy. We consider flux ratios at other ages, as well as the
use of pairs of flux ratios, revealing the presence of small-scale intrinsic
spectroscopic variations in the iron-group dominated absorption features around
~4300 A and ~4800 A. The best flux ratio overall is the color-corrected
R^c(4610/4260) at t=-2.5d from maximum light, which leads to ~30% lower scatter
with respect to the standard combination of light-curve width and color. We
examine other spectroscopic indicators related to line-profile morphology, but
none appear to lead to a significant improvement over the standard light-curve
width and color parameters.

within 50 parsecs of the Sun. The instrument is a microlens-based integral
field spectrograph integrated with a diffraction limited, apodized-pupil Lyot
coronagraph, mounted behind the Palomar adaptive optics system. The
spectrograph obtains imaging in 23 channels across the J and H bands (1.06 -
1.78 microns). In addition to obtaining spectra, this wavelength resolution
allows suppression of the chromatically dependent speckle noise, which we
describe. We have recently installed a novel internal wave front calibration
system that will provide continuous updates to the AO system every 0.5 - 1.0
minutes by sensing the wave front within the coronagraph. The Palomar AO system
is undergoing an upgrade to a much higher-order AO system (""PALM-3000""): a
3388-actuator tweeter deformable mirror working together with the existing
241-actuator mirror. This system will allow correction with subapertures as
small as 8cm at the telescope pupil using natural guide stars. The coronagraph
alone has achieved an initial dynamic range in the H-band of 2 X 10^-4 at 1
arcsecond, without speckle noise suppression. We demonstrate that spectral
speckle suppression is providing a factor of 10-20 improvement over this

first of a new generation of apodized pupil coronagraphs combined with
high-order adaptive optics and integral field spectrographs (e.g. GPI, SPHERE,
HiCIAO), and we anticipate this instrument will make a lasting contribution to
high contrast imaging in the Northern Hemisphere for years.

Effective capacity is employed as a performance metric to identify the secure
throughput of the system, i.e., effective secure throughput. It is assumed that
perfect channel side information (CSI) is available at both the transmitter and
the receivers. Initially, the scenario in which the transmitter sends common
messages to two receivers and confidential messages to one receiver is
considered. For this case, effective secure throughput region, which is the
region of constant arrival rates of common and confidential messages that can
be supported by the buffer-constrained transmitter and fading broadcast
channel, is defined. It is proven that this effective throughput region is
convex. Then, the optimal power control policies that achieve the boundary
points of the effective secure throughput region are investigated and an
algorithm for the numerical computation of the optimal power adaptation schemes
is provided. Subsequently, the special case in which the transmitter sends only
confidential messages to one receiver, is addressed in more detail. For this
case, effective secure throughput is formulated and two different power
adaptation policies are studied. In particular, it is noted that opportunistic
transmission is no longer optimal under buffer constraints and the transmitter
should not wait to send the data at a high rate until the main channel is much
better than the eavesdropper channel.

asymptotically as the nesting ratios of the lattices approach infinity. For any

Moreover, in the case of two descriptions and finite lattice vector dimensions

approach to compute HQ and quarkonium spectral functions in both scattering and

selfenergies which are implemented into spectral functions beyond the
quasiparticle approximation. Charmonium spectral functions are used to evaluate
eulcidean-time correlation functions which are compared to results from thermal
lattice QCD. The comparisons are performed in various hadronic channels
including zero-mode contributions consistently accounting for finite
charm-quark width effects. The zero modes are closely related to the
charm-quark number susceptibility which is also compared to existing lattice
""data"". Both the susceptibility and the heavy-light quark $T$-matrix are
applied to calculate the thermal charm-quark relaxation rate, or, equivalently,
the charm diffusion constant in the QGP. Implications of our findings in the HQ

the other three known forces: the electromagnetic force, and the weak and
strong nuclear forces. Though this is still a work in progress, much effort has
been put toward this goal. A set of specific tools which are used in this
effort are gauge/gravity dualities. This thesis consists of a specific
implementation of gauge/gravity dualities to describe k-strings of strongly
coupled gauge theories as objects dual to Dp-branes embedded in confining
supergravity backgrounds from low energy superstring field theory. Along with
superstring theory, k-strings are also commonly investigated with lattice gauge
theory and Hamiltonian methods. A k-string is a colorless combination of
quark-antiquark source pairs, between which a color flux tube develops. The two
most notable terms of the k-string energy are, for large quark anti-quark
separation L, the tension term, proportional to L, and the Coulombic 1/L
correction, known as the Luscher term. This thesis provides an overview of
superstring theories and how gauge/gravity dualities emerge from them. It shows
in detail how these dualities can be used for the specific problem of
calculating the k-string energy in 2 + 1 and 3 + 1 space-time dimensions as the
energy of Dp-branes in the dual gravitational theory. A detailed review of
k-string tension calculations is given where good agreement is found with
lattice gauge theory and Hamiltonian methods. In reviewing the k-string
tension, we also touch on how different representations of k-strings can be
described with Dp-branes through gauge/gravity dualities. The main result of
this thesis is how the Luscher term is found to emerge as the one loop quantum
corrections to the Dp-brane energy. In 2+1 space-time dimensions, we have
Luscher term data to compare with from lattice gauge theory, where we find good
agreement.

several light-trees may have to be used due to the limited fanouts of network

to reduce the total number of wavelength channels used (total cost) for a
multicast session, the maximum number of wavelengths required in one fiber link
(link stress) and the end-to-end delay are two parameters which are not always
taken into consideration. It is known that the shortest path tree (SPT) results
in the optimal end-to-end delay, but it can not be employed directly for
multicast routing in sparse light splitting WDM networks. Hence, we propose a
novel wavelength routing algorithm which tries to avoid the multicast incapable
branching nodes (MIBs, branching nodes without splitting capability) in the
shortest-path-based multicast tree to diminish the link stress. Good parts of
the shortest-path-tree are retained by the algorithm to reduce the end-to-end
delay. The algorithm consists of tree steps: (1) aDijkstraPro algorithmwith
priority assignment and node adoption is introduced to produce a SPT with up to
38% fewer MIB nodes in the NSF topology and 46% fewerMIB nodes in the USA
Longhaul topology, (2) critical articulation and deepest branch heuristics are
used to process the MIB nodes, (3) a distance-based light-tree reconnection
algorithm is proposed to create the multicast light-trees. Extensive
simulations demonstrate the algorithm's efficiency in terms of link stress and

temporary formation of H-bonds with suitable atomic sites in the translocating
DNA molecule. As a consequence, the average conductivity is drastically raised
by about 3 orders of magnitude while exhibiting significantly reduced
statistical variance. We have furthermore investigated how these results are
affected when the distance between opposing electrodes is varied and have
identified two regimes: for narrow electrode separation, the mere hindrance due
to the presence of protruding hydrogen atoms in the nanopore is deemed more
important, while for wider electrode separation, the formation of H-bonds
becomes the dominant effect. Based on these findings, we conclude that
hydrogenation of graphene electrode edges represents a promising approach to
reduce the translocation speed of DNA through the nanopore and substantially
improve the accuracy of the measurement process for whole-genome sequencing.

the collisional timescales are very long. As a result, heavy elements will be
under-ionized after they have passed through the accretion shock. We have
studied systematically the effects of non-equilibrium ionization for relaxed
clusters in the LambdaCDM cosmology using one-dimensional hydrodynamic
simulations. We found that non-equilibrium ionization effects do not depend on
cluster mass but depend strongly on redshift which can be understood by
self-similar scaling arguments. The effects are stronger for clusters at lower
redshifts. We present X-ray signatures such as surface brightness profiles and
emission lines in detail for a massive cluster at low redshift. In general,
soft emission (0.3-1.0 keV) is enhanced significantly by under-ionization, and
the enhancement can be nearly an order of magnitude near the shock radius. The
most prominent non-equilibrium ionization signature we found is the O VII and O
VIII line ratio. The ratios for non-equilibrium ionization and collisional
ionization equilibrium models are different by more than an order of magnitude
at radii beyond half of the shock radius. These non-equilibrium ionization
signatures are equally strong for models with different non-adiabatic shock
electron heating efficiencies. We have also calculated the detectability of the
O VII and O VIII lines with the future International X-ray Observatory (IXO).
Depending on the line ratio measured, we conclude that an exposure of ~130-380
ksec on a moderate-redshift, massive regular cluster with the X-ray
Microcalorimeter Spectrometer (XMS) on the IXO will be sufficient to provide a
strong test for the non-equilibrium ionization model.

provide is to a very good approximation a universal quantity and, as a
consequence, if a larger anisotropy is detected, this would constitute a strong
evidence for the presence of astrophysical local discrete CRE sources, whose
anisotropy, instead, can be naturally larger than the DM upper limit. We
further find that the main source of anisotropy from DM is given by the
fluctuation in the number density of DM sub-structures in the vicinity of the

  This phase inversion is explained as being due to an electron heating effect.
In the quantum Hall effect regime the $r_{xx}$ oscillations transform into
diamond-shaped patterns with different slopes corresponding to odd and even
filling factors. The diamond-shaped features at odd filling factors can be used
as a probe to determine spin energy gaps.
  A Zero Current Anomaly (ZCA) which manifests itself as a narrow dip in the
$r_{xx}(\Idc)$ characteristics at zero current, is also observed. The ZCA
effect strongly depends upon temperature, vanishing above 1 K while the
transport diamonds persist to higher temperatures. The transport diamonds and
ZCA are fully reproduced in a higher mobility GaAs/AlGaAs Hall bar structure
confirming that these phenomena reflect intrinsic properties of two-dimensional

producing a splash of neutrino emission due to Cooper pair formation (CPF)

the temperature $T_\mathrm{cn}(\rho)$ for the onset of neutron superfluidity
[$T_\mathrm{cn}(\rho)$ should have a wide peak with maximum $\approx

effects in superfluid matter ($q > 0.4$), and on the intensity of neutrino
emission before the onset of neutron superfluidity (30--100 times weaker than
the standard modified Urca process). This is serious evidence for nucleon
superfluidity in NS cores that comes from observations of cooling NSs.

treatment planning require an iterative approach. A set of computational
parameters are hypothesized that will give a dose plan that meets dosimetric
criteria. A dose plan is computed using these parameters, and if any dosimetric
criteria are not met, the process is iterated until a suitable dose plan is
found. In this way, the dose distribution is controlled by abstract parameters.
The purpose of this study is to improve HDR brachytherapy planning by
developing a new approach that directly optimizes the dose distribution based
on dosimetric criteria.
  Method: We develop Inverse Planning by Integer Program (IPIP), an
optimization model for computing HDR brachytherapy dose plans and a fast
heuristic for it. We used our heuristic to compute dose plans for 20 anonymized
prostate cancer patient image data sets from our clinic database. Dosimetry was
evaluated and compared to dosimetric criteria.
  Results: Dose plans computed from IPIP satisfied all given dosimetric
criteria for the target and healthy tissue after a single iteration. The
average target coverage was 95%. The average computation time for IPIP was 30.1
seconds on a Intel(R) CoreTM2 Duo CPU 1.67 GHz processor with 3 Gib RAM.
  Conclusion: IPIP is an HDR brachytherapy planning system that directly
incorporates dosimetric criteria. We have demonstrated that IPIP has clinically
acceptable performance for the prostate cases and dosimetric criteria used in
this study, both in terms of dosimetry and runtime. Further study is required
to determine if IPIP performs well for a more general group of patients and
dosimetric criteria, including other cancer sites such as GYN.

superconductors with a sizable spin-orbit coupling in the presence of an
external Zeeman splitting. Two such systems have been proposed: (a) s-wave
superconductor pair potential is proximity induced on a semiconductor, and (b)
pair potential naturally arises from an intrinsic s-wave pairing interaction.
As is now well known, such systems in the form of a 2D film or 1D nano-wires in
a wire-network can be used for topological quantum computation. When the
external Zeeman splitting $\Gamma$ crosses a critical value $\Gamma_c$, the
system passes from a regular superconducting phase to a non-Abelian topological
superconducting phase. In both cases (a) and (b) we consider in this paper the
pair potential $\Delta$ is strictly s-wave in both the ordinary and the
topological superconducting phases, which are separated by a topological
quantum critical point at $\Gamma_c = \sqrt{\Delta^2 + \mu^2}$, where $\mu (>>
\Delta)$ is the chemical potential. On the other hand, since $\Gamma_c >>
\Delta$, the Zeeman splitting required for the topological phase ($\Gamma >
\Gamma_c$) far exceeds the value ($\Gamma \sim \Delta$) above which an s-wave
pair potential is expected to vanish (and the system to become
non-superconducting) in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. We are thus led to
a situation that the topological superconducting phase appears to set in a
parameter regime at which the system actually is non-superconducting in the
absence of spin-orbit coupling. In this paper we address the question of how a
pure s-wave pair potential can survive a strong Zeeman field to give rise to a
topological superconducting phase. We show that the spin-orbit coupling is the
crucial parameter for the quantum transition into and the robustness of the
topologically non-trivial superconducting phase realized for $\Gamma >>
\Delta$.

important source of fuel for star formation at high redshift. However, the
presence of such filamentary gas has never been observationally confirmed. In
this work, we investigate in detail whether such cold gas is detectable using
low-ionisation metal absorption lines, such as CII \lambda1334 as this
technique has a proven observational record for detecting gaseous structures.
Using a large statistical sample of galaxies from the Mare Nostrum N-body+AMR
cosmological simulation, we find that the typical covering fraction of the
dense, cold gas in 10^12 Msun haloes at z~2.5 is lower than expected (~5%). In
addition, the absorption signal by the interstellar medium of the galaxy itself
turns out to be so deep and so broad in velocity space that it completely
drowns that of the filamentary gas. A detectable signal might be obtained from
a cold filament exactly aligned with the line of sight, but this configuration
is so unlikely that it would require surveying an overwhelmingly large number
of candidate galaxies to tease it out. Finally, the predicted metallicity of
the cold gas in filaments is extremely low (\leq 0.001 Zsun). Should this
result persist when higher resolution runs are performed, it would
significantly increase the difficulty of detecting filamentary gas inflows
using metal lines. However, even if we assume that filaments are enriched to
Zsun, the absorption signal that we compute is still weak. We are therefore led
to conclude that it is extremely difficult to observationally prove or disprove
the presence of cold filaments as the favorite accretion mode of galaxies using
low-ionisation metal absorption lines. The Ly-alpha emission route looks more
promising but due to the resonant nature of the line, radiative transfer
simulations are required to fully characterize the observed signal.

of a tight relationship between a star's age, rotation period, and magnetic
activity. This age-rotation-activity relation documents the interplay between a
star's magnetic dynamo and angular momentum evolution, and provides a valuable
age estimator for isolated field stars. While the age-rotation-activity
relation has been studied extensively in clusters younger than 500 Myr,
empirically measured rotation periods are scarce for older ages. Using the
Palomar Transient Factory (PTF), we have begun a survey of stellar rotation to
map out the late-stage evolution of the age-rotation-activity relation: the
Columbia/Cornell/Caltech PTF (CCCP) survey of open clusters. The first CCCP
target is the nearby ~600 Myr Hyades-analog Praesepe, where PTF has produced
light curves spanning more than 3 months and containing >150 measurements for
~650 cluster members. Analyzing these light curves, we have measured rotation
periods for 40 K & M cluster members, filling the gap between the periods
previously reported for solar-type Hyads (Radick et al. 1987, Prosser et al.
1995) and for a handful of low-mass Praesepe members (Scholz et al. 2007). Our
measurements indicate that Praesepe's period-color relation undergoes at
transition at a characteristic spectral type of ~M1 --- from a well-defined
singular relation at higher mass, to a more scattered distribution of both fast
and slow-rotators at lower masses. The location of this transition is broadly
consistent with expectations based on observations of younger clusters and the
assumption that stellar-spin down is the dominant mechanism influencing angular
momentum evolution at ~600 Myr. In addition to presenting the results of our

towards a better understanding of message-passing iterative decoding, namely
blockwise graph-cover decoding links max-product (min-sum) algorithm decoding
with linear programming decoding, and symbolwise graph-cover decoding links
sum-product algorithm decoding with Bethe free energy function minimization at

much larger than the maximal eigenvalues of the measured observable, it is an
interesting question how this enhancement of the measurement signal relates to
the sensitivity of quantum measurements as investigated in the field of quantum
metrology. In this presentation, it is pointed out that the estimation of a
small interaction parameter using weak measurements actually corresponds to
standard quantum metrology, where the logarithmic derivatives of the final
measurement probabilities are proportional to the corresponding weak values.
The analysis of the general weak measurement formalism then shows that extreme
weak values do not improve the sensitivity. Instead, all final measurements
with real weak values have the same sensitivity as a final measurement of the
eigenvalues. This result supports the view that real weak values can be
interpreted as precise, zero uncertainty estimates of a quantum observable,
despite their deviation from the eigenvalues of the corresponding operator.

The UV continuum slope of the composite spectrum is significantly redder than
that of a sample of non-AGN UV-selected star forming galaxies. Blueshifted SiIV
absorption provides evidence for outflowing highly-ionized gas in these objects
at speeds of ~ 10^(3) km/s, quantitatively different from what is seen in the
outflows of non-AGN LBGs. Grouping the individual AGNs by parameters such as
Ly-alpha equivalent width, redshift, and UV continuum magnitude allows for an
analysis of the major spectroscopic trends within the sample. Stronger Ly-alpha
emission is coupled with weaker low-ionization absorption, which is similar to
what is seen in the non-AGN LBGs, and highlights the role that cool
interstellar gas plays in the escape of Ly-alpha photons. However, the AGN
composite does not show the same trends between Ly-alpha strength and

evaporation of Callan-Giddings-Harvey-Strominger (CGHS) black holes within the
mean-field approximation. This semi-classical theory incorporates back
reaction. Our analytical and numerical calculations show that, while some of
the assumptions underlying the standard evaporation paradigm are borne out,
several are not. One of the anticipated properties we confirm is that the
semi-classical space-time is asymptotically flat at right future null infinity,
$\spr$, yet incomplete in the sense that null observers reach a future Cauchy
horizon in finite affine time. Unexpected behavior includes that the Bondi mass
traditionally used in the literature can become negative even when the area of
the horizon is macroscopic; an improved Bondi mass remains positive until the
end of semi-classical evaporation, yet the final value can be arbitrarily large
relative to the Planck mass; and the flux of the quantum radiation at $\spr$ is
non-thermal even when the horizon area is large compared to the Planck scale.
Furthermore, if the black hole is initially macroscopic, the evaporation
process exhibits remarkable universal properties. Although the literature on
CGHS black holes is quite rich, these features had escaped previous analyses,
in part because of lack of required numerical precision, and in part due to
misinterpretation of certain properties and symmetries of the model. Finally,
our results provide support for the full quantum scenario recently developed by
Ashtekar, Taveras and Varadarajan, and also offer a number of interesting
problems to the mathematical relativity and geometric analysis communities.

a theoretical foundation for such a communication system. Specifically, we
develop the additive inverse Gaussian (IG) noise channel model: a channel in
which the information is corrupted by noise with an inverse Gaussian
distribution. We show that such a channel model is appropriate for molecular
communication in fluid media - when propagation between transmitter and
receiver is governed by Brownian motion and when there is positive drift from
transmitter to receiver. Taking advantage of the available literature on the IG
distribution, upper and lower bounds on channel capacity are developed, and a
maximum likelihood receiver is derived. Theory and simulation results are
presented which show that such a channel does not have a single quality measure
analogous to signal-to-noise ratio in the AWGN channel. It is also shown that
the use of multiple molecules leads to reduced error rate in a manner akin to
diversity order in wireless communications. Finally, we discuss some open
problems in molecular communications that arise from the IG system model.

a conversation is degree,discourse structure, spatial and temporal structure.
The approaches present can be mainly divided into Data-Glove Based and Vision
Based approaches. An important face feature point is the nose tip. Since nose
is the highest protruding point from the face. Besides that, it is not affected
by facial expressions.Another important function of the nose is that it is able
to indicate the head pose. Knowledge of the nose location will enable us to
align an unknown 3D face with those in a face database. Eye detection is
divided into eye position detection and eye contour detection. Existing works
in eye detection can be classified into two major categories: traditional
image-based passive approaches and the active IR based approaches. The former
uses intensity and shape of eyes for detection and the latter works on the
assumption that eyes have a reflection under near IR illumination and produce
bright/dark pupil effect. The traditional methods can be broadly classified
into three categories: template based methods,appearance based methods and
feature based methods. The purpose of this paper is to compare various human
Gesture recognition systems for interfacing machines directly to human wits

unparticle effects, under the color charge of $SU(3)_c$ symmetry, in the CP
violation in neutral B meson oscillations as well as the dispersive and
absorptive parts of $\bar B_q\leftrightarrow B_q$ transition, which can be
related to the CA directly. In order to illustrate the peculiar properties of
unparticle, our analysis is carried out in two scenarios for the right-handed
section: (I) $\lambda_R=\lambda_L$ and $U_D^R=U_D^L$, where $\lambda_{L,R}$ and
$U_D^{L,R}$ are the couplings and flavor mixing matrix of left- and
right-handed section, respectively; (II) $\lambda_R >> \lambda_L$ and $U_D^R$

like-sign CA cannot be changed significantly for a SM-like CP violating source
because of the strong constraint of $\Delta m_{B_d}$. Contrarily, in scenario
II we can figure out the parameter space in which the CA can be enhanced to the
value observed by D{\O} with the constraint of $\Delta m_{B_s}$ due to the
enhancement of $\Gamma^s_{12}$. In the parameter space we obtained, the
correlation between $\Delta\Gamma^s$ and $\phi_s$ is consistent with the

characterized by a convex spectrum peaking at frequencies ranging from 100 MHz
to a few GHz are young objects. Following the evolutionary models, these
objects would evolve into the population of classical radio galaxies. However,
the fraction of young radio sources in flux density-limited samples is much
larger than what expected from the number counts of large radio sources. This
may suggest that for some reason a significant fraction of young objects would
never become large radio galaxies with sizes up to a few Mpc. The discovery of
the young radio source PKS 1518+047 characterized by an uncommonly steep
spectrum confirms that the radio emission may switch off shortly after its
onset. Then the source spectrum steepens and evolves due to energy losses. If
the interruption is not temporary, the fate of the fading sources is to
disappear at frequencies lower than those explored by current radio telescopes.
Fossils of past activities have been recently found at pc-scale distances from
newly born radio sources, suggesting the presence of short-lived objects with
an intermittent radio emission.

projected onto a null surface, exhibits a structure very similar to
non-relativistic Navier-Stokes equation. I show that this result arises quite
naturally when gravitational dynamics is viewed as an emergent phenomenon.
Extremising the spacetime entropy density associated with the null surfaces
leads to a set of equations which, when viewed in the local inertial frame,
becomes identical to the Navier-Stokes (NS) equation. This is in contrast with
the usual description of Damour-Navier-Stokes (DNS) equation in a general
coordinate system, in which there appears a Lie derivative rather than
convective derivative. I discuss this difference, its importance and why it is
more appropriate to view the equation in a local inertial frame. The viscous
force on fluid, arising from the gradient of the viscous stress-tensor,
involves the second derivatives of the metric and does not vanish in the local
inertial frame while the viscous stress-tensor itself vanishes so that inertial
observers detect no dissipation. We thus provide an entropy extremisation
principle that leads to the DNS equation, which makes the hydrodynamical
analogy with gravity completely natural and obvious. Several implications of
these results are discussed.

environmental cues including the feedback obtained through experience.
Nevertheless, the effects of the experience-based learning of players in
evolution and maintenance of cooperation in social dilemma games remain
relatively unclear. Some previous literature showed that mutual cooperation of
learning players is difficult or requires a sophisticated learning model. In
the context of the iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, we numerically examine the
performance of a reinforcement learning model. Our model modifies those of
Karandikar et al. (1998), Posch et al. (1999), and Macy and Flache (2002) in
which players satisfice if the obtained payoff is larger than a dynamic
threshold. We show that players obeying the modified learning mutually
cooperate with high probability if the dynamics of threshold is not too fast
and the association between the reinforcement signal and the action in the next
round is sufficiently strong. The learning players also perform efficiently
against the reactive strategy. In evolutionary dynamics, they can invade a
population of players adopting simpler but competitive strategies. Our version
of the reinforcement learning model does not complicate the previous model and
is sufficiently simple yet flexible. It may serve to explore the relationships
between learning and evolution in social dilemma situations.

formal quantization of the phenomenological Kirchhoff equations for the
corresponding circuits. In this paper a simplified version of the BCS theory
for superconductors is used to derive microscopic models for all types of small
Josephson junctions. For these models the state-dependent individual tunneling
of Cooper pairs couples ground pair states with excited pair states what leads
to a more complicated structure of the lowest lying energy levels. In
particular, the highly degenerate levels emerge, which act as probability sinks
for the qubit. These models allow also for the coupling to phonons as an

have been used to account for the strong on-site Coulomb repulsion among the
localized Cr 3d electrons. By choosing the Hubbard \emph{U} parameter around 4
eV, ferromagnetic, and/or antiferromagnetic ground states can be achieved and
our calculated lattice constants, bulk moduli, and equation of states are in
good agreement with recent experiments [W. Xiao \emph{et al.}, PNAS
\textbf{107}, 14026 (2010)]. The bonding nature of B$-$O bonds in these
ABO$_{3}$ compounds exhibit evident covalent character and our electron
transferring study indicates that the ionicity shows decreasing trend with
increasing fraction of CrO$_{6/2}$ octahedron within the
PbCrO$_{3}$-CrPbO$_{3}$ random compounds. The lengthes of B$-$O bonds determine
their lattice parameters, thus, clearly indicates that the abnormally large
volume and compressibility is due to the contain of CrPbO$_{3}$ in the
experimental sample and the transition of PbO$_{6/2}$ octahedron to CrO$_{6/2}$
upon compression.

proportional to the mean velocity of the flow, but the values of $\gamma$ are
larger than the theoretical predictions. Specifically, we focus on two

Feynman-Metropolis-Teller theory for compressed atoms is applied to the study
of general relativistic white dwarf equilibrium configurations. The equation of
state, which takes into account the \beta-equilibrium, the nuclear and the
Coulomb interactions between the nuclei and the surrounding electrons, is
obtained as a function of the compression by considering each atom constrained
in a Wigner-Seitz cell. The contribution of quantum statistics, weak, nuclear,
and electromagnetic interactions is obtained by the determination of the
chemical potential of the Wigner-Seitz cell. The further contribution of the
general relativistic equilibrium of white dwarf matter is expressed by the
simple formula $\sqrt{g_{00}}\mu_{\rm ws}$= constant, which links the chemical
potential of the Wigner-Seitz cell $\mu_{\rm ws}$ with the general relativistic
gravitational potential $g_{00}$ at each point of the configuration. The
configuration outside each Wigner-Seitz cell is strictly neutral and therefore
no global electric field is necessary to warranty the equilibrium of the white
dwarf. These equations modify the ones used by Chandrasekhar by taking into due
account the Coulomb interaction between the nuclei and the electrons as well as
inverse \beta-decay. They also generalize the work of Salpeter by considering a
unified self-consistent approach to the Coulomb interaction in each
Wigner-Seitz cell. The consequences on the numerical value of the
Chandrasekhar-Landau mass limit as well as on the mass-radius relation of
$^4$He, $^{12}$C, $^{16}$O and $^{56}$Fe white dwarfs are presented. All these
effects should be taken into account in processes requiring a precision

hadron collider experiments, provide tight constraints on the parton
distribution function (PDF) in the proton. The extension of these analyses to
nuclear parton distributions (nPDF) has attracted much interest in recent
years. nPDFs are needed as benchmarks for the characterization of hot QCD
matter in nucleus-nucleus collisions, and attract further interest since they
may show novel signatures of non-linear density-dependent QCD evolution.
However, it is not known from first principles whether the factorization of
long-range phenomena into process-independent parton distribution, which
underlies global PDF extractions for the proton, extends to nuclear effects. As
a consequence, assessing the reliability of nPDFs for benchmark calculations
goes beyond testing the numerical accuracy of their extraction and requires
phenomenological tests of the factorization assumption. Here we argue that a
proton-nucleus collision programme at the LHC, including a rapidity scan, would
provide a set of measurements allowing for unprecedented tests of the
factorization assumption underlying global nPDF fits.

epidemics in a highly reproducible in vitro system consisting of tens of
thousands of virtually motionless cells. We use a confluent astroglial
monolayer in a Petri dish and induce productive infection in a limited number
of cells with a genetically modified herpesvirus strain. This approach allows
extreme high resolution tracking of the spatio-temporal development of the
epidemic. We show that a simple model is capable of reproducing the basic
features of our observations, i.e., the observed behaviour is likely to be
applicable to many different kinds of systems. Statistical physics inspired
approaches to our data, such as fractal dimension of the infected clusters as
well as their size distribution, seem to fit into a percolation theory based
interpretation. We suggest that our observations may be used to model epidemics
in more complex systems, which are difficult to study in isolation.

evolution of stellar systems. In particular, they are considered as a plausible
origin of stellar eruptions of the V838 Mon type. V1309 Sco is the most recent
eruption of this type in our Galaxy. The object was discovered in September
2008. Our aim is to investigate the nature of V1309 Sco. V1309 Sco has been
photometrically observed in course of the OGLE project since August 2001. We
analyse these observations in different ways. In particular, periodogram
analyses were done to investigate the nature of the observed short term
variability of the progenitor. We find out that the progenitor of V1309 Sco was
a contact binary with an orbital period of ~1.4 day. This period was decreasing
with time. Similarly the light curve of the binary was also evolving,
indicating that the system evolved toward its merger. The violent phase of the
merger, marked by the systematic brightenning of the object, started in March
2008, i.e. half a year before the outburst discovery. We also investigate the
observations of V1309 Sco during the outburst and the decline and show that
they can be fully accounted for within the merger hypothesis. For the first
time in the literature we show, from direct observations, that contact binaries
indeed end up by merging into a single object, as it was suggested in numerous
theoretical studies of these systems. Our study also shows that stellar mergers
indeed result in eruptions of the V838 Mon type.

synchronize in antiphase or in phase depending on the positive or negative

It is indicating the existence of the energy-dependent centrality point where
some sudden changes in the correlation pattern are observed. In the present

processes leading to the observed phenomenon.
  This onset is characterized by some definite (""critical"") number of

particle density, to characterize this threshold behavior, this variable brings
the transition points for two energies to coincidence [1]. So parameters of the
percolation model are defined at these critical points. Also we use results of

large-scale data mining, progress in these areas seems hard or impossible.
Therefore, a suitable, distributed data mining infrastructure and research
centers should be built in Europe. It also appears appropriate to build a
network of Crisis Observatories. They can be imagined as laboratories devoted
to the gathering and processing of enormous volumes of data on both natural
systems such as the Earth and its ecosystem, as well as on human
techno-socio-economic systems, so as to gain early warnings of impending
events. Reality mining provides the chance to adapt more quickly and more
accurately to changing situations. Further opportunities arise by individually
customized services, which however should be provided in a privacy-respecting
way. This requires the development of novel ICT (such as a self- organizing
Web), but most likely new legal regulations and suitable institutions as well.
As long as such regulations are lacking on a world-wide scale, it is in the
public interest that scientists explore what can be done with the huge data
available. Big data do have the potential to change or even threaten democratic
societies. The same applies to sudden and large-scale failures of ICT systems.
Therefore, dealing with data must be done with a large degree of responsibility
and care. Self-interests of individuals, companies or institutions have limits,
where the public interest is affected, and public interest is not a sufficient
justification to violate human rights of individuals. Privacy is a high good,

Interferometer and the MIDI instrument at a 42m baseline probing angular scales
of 50 milli-arcseconds. We model the observed visibilities in parallel with
diffraction-limited images at both 24.5micron and in the N-band (with
resolutions of 0.6"" and 0.3"", respectively), as well as the spectral energy
distribution. The arcsec-scale spatial information reveals the well-resolved
emission from the dusty envelope. By simultaneously modelling the spatial and
spectral data, we find that the bulk of the dust emission occurs at several
dust sublimation radii (approximately 170 AU). This reproduces the high
mid-infrared fluxes and at the same time the low visibilities observed in the
MIDI data for wavelengths longward of 8.5micron. However, shortward of this
wavelength the visibility data show a sharp up-turn indicative of compact
emission. We discuss various potential sources of this emission. We exclude a
dust disk being responsible for the observed spectral imprint on the
visibilities. A cool supergiant star and an accretion disk are considered and
both shown to be viable origins of the compact mid-infrared emission. We
propose that CRL2136 is embedded in a dusty envelope, which truncates at
several times the dust sublimation radius. A dust torus is manifest in the
equatorial region. We find that the spectro-interferometric N-band signal can
be reproduced by either a gaseous disk or a bloated central star. If the disk
extends to the stellar surface, it accretes at a rate of 3.0 10^(-3) Msun/yr.

ellipticals obtained with the SAURON integral field unit on the William

are likely to miss more complicated kinematic features, with SAURON we are able

much more detailed view of the mass distribution and star formation histories.

population properties are concerned. We find the presence of substructures,
varying degrees of flattening and of rotation, as well as differences in age
and metallicity gradients. We confirm that two of our galaxies are
significantly flattened, yet non-rotating objects, which makes them likely
triaxial systems. The comparison between the dwarf and the giant groups shows
that dEs could be a low-mass extension of Es in the sense that they do seem to
follow the same trends with mass. However, dEs as progenitors of Es seem less
likely as we have seen that dEs have much lower abundance ratios.

symmetry is constructed. This is achieved by analysing the possible symmetries
of such systems in terms of automorphisms of the algebra. In fact, different
realisations for this type of symmetry are obtained, including the natural
occurrence of charge conjugation together with parity and time reversal. Once
specified the underlying anti-linear symmetry of the Hamiltonian, the former,
if unbroken, leads to a purely real spectrum and the latter can be mapped to a
Hermitian counterpart by, amongst other possibilities, a similarity
transformation. Here, Lie-algebraic methods which were used to investigate the
generalised Swanson Hamiltonian are employed to identify the class of quadratic
Hamiltonians that allow for such a mapping to the Hermitian counterpart.
Whereas for the linear su(2) system every Hamiltonian of this type can be
mapped to a Hermitian counterpart by a transformation which is itself an
exponential of a linear combination of su(2) generators, the situation is more
complicated for quadratic Hamiltonians. Therefore, the possibility of more
elaborate similarity transformations, including quadratic exponents, is also
explored in detail. The existence of finite dimensional representations for the
su(2) Hamiltonian, as opposed to the su(1,1) studied before, allows for
comparison with explicit diagonalisation results for finite matrices. Finally,
the similarity transformations constructed are compared with the analogue of
Swanson's method for exact diagonalsation of the problem, establishing a simple
relation between both approaches.

this sequence as the combined interaction of electrons and protons with the

predicts that the two basic maximum peak frequencies scale with the mass of the
central black hole as $M_{BH}^{-1/2}$, have a ratio of $(m_p/m_e)^{3}$, and the
luminosities with the mass itself $M_{BH}$. Due to strong losses of the

stars (HVS), are important tracers of the properties of the dark matter halo,
in particular its mass. Based on the SDSS DR6 spectral database a search for
the fastest stars among hot subdwarfs (sdB) in the halo is carried out to
identify HVS, unbound to the Galaxy, and bound population II stars in order to
derive a lower limit to the halo mass. The radial velocity measurements were
verified at several telescopes to exclude radial velocity variable stars. Out
of 88 stars observed in the follow-up campaign 39 stars were found to have
constant radial velocities. For twelve of them we measured a proper motion
significantly different from zero and obtained spectroscopic distances from
quantitative spectral analysis to construct the full 6D phase space information
for a kinematical study. The programme sdBs can be distinguished into two
kinematical groups, one (G1) with low Galactic rotation typical of halo stars
and a second one (G2) with rapid retrograde motion. The G1 objects crossed the
Galactic plane in the central bulge, whereas the G2 stars did in the outer
Galactic disc. J1211+1437 (G2) is a HVS candidate, as it is unbound to the
Galaxy if the standard Galactic potential is adopted. We conclude that in the
ejection scenario G1 stars might have been formed via the slingshot mechanism
that invokes acceleration by tidal interaction of a binary with the central
supermassive black hole. The G2 stars, however, would originate in the
outskirts of the Galactic disc and not in the central bulge. J1211+1437 is the
first unbound subdwarf B star, for which we can rule out the slingshot
mechanism. Alternatively, we may assume that the stars are old population II
stars and therefore have to be bound. Then the kinematics of J1211+1437 set a
lower limit of 2 x 10^12 Msun to the mass of the Galactic dark matter halo.

supercritical disk funnel, where the illuminating radiation comes from deeper
funnel regions, to be further reflected in the outer visible funnel walls. The
illuminating spectrum is similar to that observed in ULXs, its luminosity has

The majority of
phages contain a double-stranded DNA genome packaged in a capsid at a density
of ~500 mg/ml. This high density requires substantial compression of the normal
B form helix, leading to the conjecture that DNA in mature phage virions is
under significant pressure, and that pressure is used to eject the DNA during
infection. A large number of theoretical, computer simulation and in vitro
experimental studies surrounding this conjecture has revealed many --- though
often isolated and/or contradictory --- aspects of packaged DNA. This prompts
us to present a unified view of the statistical physics and thermodynamics of
DNA packaged in phage capsids. We argue that the DNA in a mature phage is in a
(meta)stable state, wherein electrostatic self-repulsion is balanced by
curvature stress due to confinement in the capsid. We show that in addition to
the osmotic pressure associated with the packaged DNA and its counterions,
there are four different pressures within the capsid: pressure on the DNA,
hydrostatic pressure, the pressure experienced by the capsid, and the pressure
associated with the chemical potential of DNA ejection. Significantly, we
analyze the mechanism of force transmission in the packaged DNA, and
demonstrate that the pressure on DNA is not important for ejection. We derive
equations showing a strong hydrostatic pressure difference across the capsid
shell. We propose that when a phage is triggered to eject by interaction with
its receptor in vitro, the (thermodynamic) incentive of water molecules to
enter the phage capsid flushes the DNA out of the capsid. In vivo, the
difference between the osmotic pressures in the bacterial cell cytoplasm and
the culture medium similarly results in a water flow that drags the DNA out of
the capsid and into the bacterial cell.

[13]Mining Image data is the one of the essential features in this present
scenario since image data plays vital role in every aspect of the system such
as business for marketing, hospital for surgery, engineering for construction,
Web for publication and so on. The other area in the Image mining system is the
Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) which performs retrieval based on the
similarity defined in terms of extracted features with more objectiveness. The
drawback in CBIR is the features of the query image alone are considered.
Hence, a new technique called Image retrieval based on optimum clusters is
proposed for improving user interaction with image retrieval systems by fully
exploiting the similarity information. The index is created by describing the
images according to their color characteristics, with compact feature vectors,
that represent typical color distributions [12].

extra-acceleration ARin which naturally arises in some recent models of
modified gravity at large distances. In particular, we focus on the
perturbations induced by it on the two-body range {\rho} and range-rate
{\rho}\cdot which are commonly used in satellite and planetary investigations
as primary observable quantities. The constraints obtained for ARin by
comparing our calculations with the currently available range and range-rate
residuals for some of the major bodies of the solar system, obtained without
explicitly modeling ARin, are 1 - 2 \times 10-13 m s-2 (Mercury and Venus), 1
\times 10-14 m s-2 (Saturn), 1 \times 10-15 m s-2 (Mars), while for a
terrestrial Rindler acceleration we have 5 \times 10-16 m s-2 (Moon). Another
approach which could be followed consists of taking into account ARin in
re-processing all the available data sets with accordingly modified dynamical
models, and estimating a dedicated solve-for parameter explicitly accounting
for it. Anyway, such a method is time-consuming. A preliminary analysis likely
performed in such a way by a different author yields A <= 8\times10-14 m s-2 at
Mars' distance and A < = 1\times10-14 m s-2 at Saturn's distance. The method
adopted here can be easily and straightforwardly extended to other long-range
modified models of gravity as well.

the design of optical and electronic devices. In this work we propose a
theoretical model to calculate the electronic properties of polytypic

formulation is based on the $\vec{k} \cdot \vec{p}$ method connecting the
irreducible representations in the interface of the two different crystalline
phases by group theory arguments. Analyzing the composition of the states in
the $\Gamma$ point and the overlap integrals of the envelope functions we
predict energy transitions that agree with experimental photoluminescence
spectra.

graphene ribbons using a tight-binding model within the Slater Koster
approximation.
  We find that curvature dramatically enhances the action of spin orbit effects
in graphene ribbons and has a strong effect on the spin orientation of the edge
states: whereas spins are normal to the surface in the case of flat ribbons,
this is no longer the case in the case of curved ribbons. We find that for the
edge states, the spin density lies always in the plane perpendicular to the
ribbon axis, and deviate strongly from the normal to the ribbon, even for very
small curvature and the small spin orbit coupling of carbon. We find that
curvature results also in an effective second neighbor hopping that modifies
the electronic properties of zigzag graphene ribbons. We discuss the
implications of our finding in the spin Hall phase of curved graphene Ribbons.

discovered by INTEGRAL. It was in outburst for about a month from September 13,
2009. The broad-band average spectrum is well described by thermal
Comptonization with an electron temperature of kT_e ~ 25 keV, soft seed photons
of kT_bb ~ 0.6 keV, and Thomson optical depth \tau_T ~ 2 in a slab geometry.
During the outburst the spectrum stays remarkably stable with plasma and soft
seed photon temperatures and scattering optical depth being constant within
errors. We fitted the outburst profile with the exponential model, and using
the disk instability model we inferred the outer disk radius to be (4.8 - 5.4)
\times 1010 cm. The INTEGRAL and RXTE data reveal the X-ray pulsation at a
period of 4.08 milliseconds up to ~ 120 keV. The pulsed fraction is shown to
decrease from ~22% at 3 keV to a constant pulsed fraction of ~17-18% between
7-30 keV, and then to decrease again down to ~13% at 60 keV. The nearly
sinusoidal pulses show soft lags monotonically increasing with energy to about
0.2 ms at 10-20 keV similar to those observed in other accreting pulsars. The
short burst profiles indicate hydrogen-poor material at ignition, which
suggests either that the accreted material is hydrogen-deficient, or that the
CNO metallicity is up to a factor of 2 times solar. However, the variation of
burst recurrence time as a function of m (inferred from the X-ray flux) is much
smaller than predicted by helium-ignition models.

question whether there exists a straight-line drawing of $G$ such that each
vertex is represented as a distinct point of $S$ as well as to provide an
embedding if one does exist. Recently, in \cite{DBLP:conf/gd/NishatMR10}, a
complete characterization for this problem on a special class of graphs known
as the plane 3-trees was presented along with an efficient algorithm to solve
the problem. In this paper, we use the same characterization to devise an
improved algorithm for the same problem. Much of the efficiency we achieve
comes from clever uses of the triangular range search technique. We also study
a generalized version of the problem and present improved algorithms for this

pulsating classical Cepheid supergiant - it is the pulsation that causes their
luminosity to vary. Such pulsational masses are found to be smaller than the
masses derived from stellar evolution theory: this is the Cepheid mass
discrepancy problem, for which a solution is missing. An independent, accurate
dynamical mass determination for a classical Cepheid variable star (as opposed
to type-II Cepheids, low-mass stars with a very different evolutionary history)
in a binary system is needed in order to determine which is correct. The
accuracy of previous efforts to establish a dynamical Cepheid mass from
Galactic single-lined noneclipsing binaries was typically about 15-30 per cent,
which is not good enough to resolve the mass discrepancy problem. In spite of
many observational efforts, no firm detection of a classical Cepheid in an
eclipsing double-lined binary has hitherto been reported. Here we report the
discovery of a classical Cepheid in a well detached, double-lined eclipsing
binary in the Large Magellanic Cloud. We determine the mass to a precision of
one per cent and show that it agrees with its pulsation mass, providing strong
evidence that pulsation theory correctly and precisely predicts the masses of
classical Cepheids
