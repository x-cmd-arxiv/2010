  We introduce a significant improvement to the conventional NPR method in
which the bare matrix elements are renormalized non-perturbatively in the
RI-MOM scheme and are then converted into the MSbar scheme using continuum
perturbation theory. In addition to RI-MOM, we introduce and implement four
non-exceptional intermediate momentum schemes that suppress infrared
non-perturbative uncertainties in the renormalization procedure. We compute the
conversion factors relating the matrix elements in this family of RI-SMOM
schemes and MSbar at one-loop order. Comparison of the results obtained using
these different intermediate schemes allows for a more reliable estimate of the
unknown higher-order contributions and hence for a correspondingly more robust
estimate of the systematic error. We also apply a recently proposed approach in
which twisted boundary conditions are used to control the Symanzik expansion
for off-shell vertex functions leading to a better control of the
renormalization in the continuum limit.
  We control chiral extrapolation errors by considering both the NLO SU(2)
chiral effective theory, and an analytic mass expansion. We obtain
$B_K^{\msbar}(3 GeV) = 0.529(5)_{stat}(15)_\chi(2)_{FV}(11)_{NPR}$. This

all sources of error in quadrature we obtain $\hat{B}_K =
0.749(27)_{combined}$, with an overall combined error of 3.6%.

called bipartite plug-in (BPI) estimators for estimating integrals of
non-linear functions of a probability density, such as Shannon entropy and
R\'enyi entropy. The density is assumed to be smooth, have bounded support, and
be uniformly bounded from below on this set. Unlike previous $k$-NN estimators
of non-linear density functionals, the proposed estimator uses data-splitting
and boundary correction to achieve lower mean square error. Specifically, we
assume that $T$ i.i.d. samples ${X}_i \in \mathbb{R}^d$ from the density are
split into two pieces of cardinality $M$ and $N$ respectively, with $M$ samples
used for computing a k-nearest-neighbor density estimate and the remaining $N$
samples used for empirical estimation of the integral of the density
functional. By studying the statistical properties of k-NN balls, explicit
rates for the bias and variance of the BPI estimator are derived in terms of
the sample size, the dimension of the samples and the underlying probability
distribution. Based on these results, it is possible to specify optimal choice
of tuning parameters $M/T$, $k$ for maximizing the rate of decrease of the mean
square error (MSE). The resultant optimized BPI estimator converges faster and
achieves lower mean squared error than previous $k$-NN entropy estimators. In
addition, a central limit theorem is established for the BPI estimator that
allows us to specify tight asymptotic confidence intervals.

billiard in dependence of its geometry and an applied magnetic field, it is
shown that a controllable switching of currents between the four terminals can
be obtained. Depending on the eccentricity of the semi-ellipse and the width
and placement of the leads, high transmittivity at zero magnetic field is
reached either through states guided along the curved boundary or focused onto
the straight boundary of the billiard. For small eccentricity, attachment of
leads at the ellipse foci can yield optimized corresponding transmission, while
departures from this behavior demonstrate the inapplicability of classical
considerations in the deep quantum regime. The geometrically determined
transmission is altered by the phase-modulating and deflecting effect of the
magnetic field, which switches the pairs of leads connected by high
transmittivity. It is shown that the elliptic boundary is responsible for these
very special transport properties. At higher field strengths edge states form
and the multiterminal transmission coefficients are determined by the topology
of the billiard. The combination of magnetotransport with geometrically
optimized transmission behavior leads to an efficient control of the current
through the multiterminal structure.

wind and temperature throughout the troposphere is presented. The model is
based on radiosonde measurements of wind and temperature during several years.
The profiles measured under quite different atmospheric conditions exhibit
qualitative similarity, and a proper choice of the reference scales for the
wind, temperature and altitude levels allows to consider the measurement data
as realizations of a random process with universal characteristics: means, the
basic functions and parameters of standard distributions for transform
coefficients of the Principal Component Analysis. The features of the
atmospheric conditions are described by statistical characteristics of the
wind-temperature ensemble of dimensional reference scales. The high
effectiveness of the proposed approach is provided by a similarity of wind -
temperature vertical profiles, which allow to carry out the statistical
modeling in the low-dimension space of the dimensional reference scales for the
wind, temperature and altitude levels. The knowledge of the joint
wind-temperature distributions in altitude open wide perspectives for modeling
of various physical processes in real atmospheric conditions like the transfer
of passive scalars or impurities, the electromagnetic wave penetration, the
instability of internal waves, transition to turbulence etc.

production at RHIC $k_T$-factorization holds numerically with about 10-20%

light and charm meson production in $dA$ collisions to that in $AA$ ones.
Unlike the open charm, the breakdown of factorization in $J/\psi$ production is
severe. Indeed, already at the lowest order in gluon density the main
contribution to the inclusive cross section is proportional to the square of
gluon density in the nucleus. As a consequence, one cannot infer the cold

within the Anderson lattice Hamiltonian with a two-fold degenerate $f$-level in
each site, corresponding to $5f^2$ electronic configuration with $S=1$ spins. A
derivation of the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation is presented and the
resulting Hamiltonian has an effective $f$-band term, in addition to the
regular exchange Kondo interaction between the $S=1$ $f$-spins and the $s=1/2$
spins of the conduction electrons. The obtained effective Kondo lattice model
can describe both the Kondo regime and a weak delocalization of $5f$-electron.
Within this model we compute the Kondo and Curie temperatures as a function of
model parameters, namely the Kondo exchange interaction constant $J_K$, the
magnetic intersite exchange interaction $J_H$ and the effective $f$-bandwidth.
We deduce, therefore, a phase diagram of the model which yields the coexistence
of Kondo effect and ferromagnetic ordering and also accounts for the pressure

Double-, single- and non-resonant top contributions of the order

requires the introduction of a complex-mass scheme for unstable top quarks.
Moreover, the intermediate W bosons are treated off-shell. Comparison to the
narrow width approximation for top quarks, where non-factorizable corrections
are not accounted for is performed. Besides the total cross section and its
scale dependence, several differential distributions at the TeVatron run II and
the LHC are given. In case of the TeVatron the forward-backward asymmetry of
the top is recalculated afresh. With inclusive selection cuts, the
forward-backward asymmetry amounts to A^{t}_{FB} = 0.051 +/- 0.0013.
Furthermore, the corrections with respect to leading order are positive and of
the order 2.3% for the TeVatron and 47% for the LHC. A study of the scale

uncertainty due to higher order corrections is 8% for the TeVatron and 9% for

mostly due to the possibility of recent anomalies in cosmic rays and microwave
sky maps being due to the annihilation or decay of dark matter. In this thesis,
we argue however that these signals are plagued by irreducible astrophysical
backgrounds and show how plausible conventional physics can mimic the alleged
dark matter signals. In particular, we consider the possibility that the rise
in the positron fraction observed by the PAMELA satellite is due to the
production through (hadronic) cosmic ray spallation and subsequent acceleration
of positrons, in the same sources as the primary cosmic rays. We present a new
analytical estimate of the range of possible fluctuations in the high energy
electron flux due to the discreteness of plausible cosmic ray sources. Fitting
our result for the total electron-positron flux measured by the Fermi satellite
allows us to fix the only free parameter of the model and make an independent
prediction for the positron fraction. This model can be tested by considering
similar effects expected for nuclear secondary-to-primary ratios such as B/C. A
rise predicted above O(100) GeV/n would be an unique confirmation of our
explanation for a rising positron fraction and rule out the dark matter
explanation. Furthermore, we review the assumptions made in the extraction of
the `WMAP haze' which has also been claimed to be due to electrons and
positrons from dark matter annihilation in the Galactic centre region. We argue
that the energy-dependence of their diffusion makes the extraction of the haze
through template fitting unreliable. The systematic effects introduced by this
can, under specific circumstances, reproduce the residual, suggesting that the
`haze' may be just an artefact of the template subtraction.

parameters and reconsidered nature of G5.89-0.39 based on the new distance as
follows. (1) The ionizing star of the ultra compact (UC) HII region is a late
O-type (O8 - 8.5) zero age main sequence (ZAMS) star, consistent with
previously established limits based on its infrared spectral line emission. (2)
Crescent-like maser alignment at the position of the O type ZAMS star may trace
accretion disk (or its remnant), which suggests that the star is still young
and before complete evaporation of circumstellar materials. (3) Although the
revised mass for the east-west outflow has been reduced, it still quite large
(100 Msun) which indicates that a significant fraction of the mass is entrained
material and that the dynamical age significantly underestimates the actual
outflow age. Our newly-derived distance emphasizes that G5.89-0.39 is one of
the nearest targets to investigate ongoing high-mass star formation and

the database community. Roughly, the idea is that a randomized query mechanism
provides sufficient privacy protection if the ratio between the probabilities
of two different entries to originate a certain answer is bound by e^\epsilon.
In the fields of anonymity and information flow there is a similar concern for
controlling information leakage, i.e. limiting the possibility of inferring the
secret information from the observables. In recent years, researchers have
proposed to quantify the leakage in terms of the information-theoretic notion
of mutual information. There are two main approaches that fall in this
category: One based on Shannon entropy, and one based on R\'enyi's min entropy.
The latter has connection with the so-called Bayes risk, which expresses the
probability of guessing the secret. In this paper, we show how to model the
query system in terms of an information-theoretic channel, and we compare the
notion of differential privacy with that of mutual information. We show that
the notion of differential privacy is strictly stronger, in the sense that it
implies a bound on the mutual information, but not viceversa.

robust rank correlation screening (RRCS) method to deal with ultra-high
dimensional data. The new procedure is based on the Kendall \tau correlation
coefficient between response and predictor variables rather than the Pearson
correlation of existing methods. The new method has four desirable features
compared with existing independence screening methods. First, the sure
independence screening property can hold only under the existence of a second
order moment of predictor variables, rather than exponential tails or
alikeness, even when the number of predictor variables grows as fast as
exponentially of the sample size. Second, it can be used to deal with
semiparametric models such as transformation regression models and single-index
models under monotonic constraint to the link function without involving
nonparametric estimation even when there are nonparametric functions in the
models. Third, the procedure can be largely used against outliers and influence
points in the observations. Last, the use of indicator functions in rank
correlation screening greatly simplifies the theoretical derivation due to the
boundedness of the resulting statistics, compared with previous studies on
variable screening. Simulations are carried out for comparisons with existing
methods and a real data example is analyzed.

network can easily be decomposed into subgraphs that are densely connected
within and weakly connected between each other -- as a factor affecting
metabolic robustness. In this paper we measure the relation between network
modularity and several aspects of robustness directly in a model system of
metabolism. [Methodology/Principal Findings] By using a model for generating
chemical reaction systems where one can tune the network modularity, we find
that robustness increases with modularity for changes in the concentrations of
metabolites, whereas it decreases with changes in the expression of enzymes.
The same modularity scaling is true for the speed of relaxation after the
perturbations. [Conclusions/Significance] Modularity is not a general principle
for making metabolism either more or less robust; this question needs to be
addressed specifically for different types of perturbations of the system.

the concept of dynamical decoupling pulse-sequence construction as a

A detailed mathematical description of how dephasing and the suppression of

channels are developed, and several of their consequences explored. Kraus
operators are employed to bring out the manner in which the unphysical matrix
transposition map when accompanied by injection of a threshold classical noise
becomes a physical channel. The action of the quantum-limited attenuator and
amplifier channels as simply scaling maps on suitable quasi-probabilities in
phase space is examined in the Kraus picture. Consideration of cumulants is
used to examine the issue of fixed points. In the cases of
entanglement-breaking channels a description in terms of rank one Kraus
operators is shown to emerge quite simply. In contradistinction, it is shown
that there is not even one finite rank operator in the entire linear span of
Kraus operators of the quantum-limited amplifier or attenuator families, an
assertion far stronger than the statement that these are not entanglement
breaking channels. A characterization of extremality in terms of Kraus
operators, originally due to Choi, is employed to show that all quantum-limited
Gaussian channels are extremal. The fact that every noisy Gaussian channel can
be realised as product of a pair of quantum-limited channels is used to
construct a discrete set of linearly independent Kraus operators for noisy
Gaussian channels, including the classical noise channel, and these Kraus
operators have a particularly simple structure.

analyzed in the context of the (inelastic) Enskog equation. Although the Enskog
equation neglects velocity correlations among particles which are about to
collide, it retains spatial correlations arising from volume exclusion effects
and thus it is expected to apply to moderate densities. In the steady state
with gradients only along a given direction, a segregation criterion is
obtained from the thermal diffusion factor $\Lambda$ measuring the amount of
segregation parallel to the thermal gradient. As expected, the sign of the
factor $\Lambda$ provides a criterion for the transition between the Brazil-nut
effect (BNE) and the reverse Brazil-nut effect (RBNE) by varying the parameters
of the mixture (masses, sizes, concentration, solid volume fraction, and
coefficients of restitution). The form of the phase diagrams for the BNE/RBNE
transition is illustrated in detail for several systems, with special emphasis
on the significant role played by the inelasticity of collisions. In
particular, an effect already found in dilute gases (segregation in a binary
mixture of identical masses and sizes {\em but} different coefficients of
restitution) is extended to dense systems. A comparison with recent computer
simulation results shows a good qualitative agreement at the level of the
thermal diffusion factor. The present analysis generalizes to arbitrary
concentration previous theoretical results derived in the tracer limit case.

oscillation spectrum of nanocrystal becomes discrete, and the separate modes of
oscillations does not interact with each other, that considerably strengthens
all phonon modulated processes in a crystal. Covering of such a nanocrystallite
with the shielding surface of a material with the higher nuclear weight will
allow to create the phonon resonators whose oscillation modes will represent
the standing waves and, will be amplified by the resonant manner. The
composites made of phonon resonators will allow to produce a perspective
functional material for the electronics with adjustable structure and
properties. Some new mechanism of HTS based on phonon resonators is proposed.

the Gaussian quantum discord, we define a Gaussian AMID by constraining the
optimization to all bi-local Gaussian positive operator valued measurements. We
solve the optimization explicitly for relevant families of states, including
squeezed thermal states. Remarkably, we find that there is a finite subset of
two-mode Gaussian states, comprising pure states, where non-Gaussian
measurements such as photon counting are globally optimal for the AMID and
realize a strictly smaller state disturbance compared to the best Gaussian
measurements. However, for the majority of two--mode Gaussian states the
unoptimized MID provides a loose overestimation of the actual content of
quantum correlations, as evidenced by its comparison with Gaussian discord.
This feature displays strong similarity with the case of two qubits. Upper and
lower bounds for the Gaussian AMID at fixed Gaussian discord are identified. We
further present a comparison between Gaussian AMID and Gaussian entanglement of
formation, and classify families of two-mode states in terms of their Gaussian
AMID, Gaussian discord, and Gaussian entanglement of formation. Our findings

therefore important to understand the transport mechanisms to prevent impurity

[resp. strongly integrable (SI)] if there exists a submersion \Phi:M\to R^{n-k}
such that L\subset \Phi^{-1}(0) [resp. L= \Phi^{-1}(0)]. In this work we study
the following problem, first stated in a particular case by Costa et al.
(Invent. Math. 1988): which submanifolds L of an open manifold M are WI or SI?
For general M, we explicitly solve the case k=n-1 and provide necessary and
sufficient conditions for submanifolds to be WI and SI in higher codimension.
As particular cases we recover the theorem of Bouma and Hector (Indagationes
Math. 1983) asserting that any open orientable surface is SI in R^3, and
Watanabe's and Miyoshi's theorems (Topology 1993 and 1995) claiming that any
link is WI in an open 3-manifold. In the case M=R^n we fully characterize WI
and SI submanifolds, we provide examples of 3- and 7-manifolds which are not WI
and we show that a theorem by Miyoshi (Topology 1995) which states that any
link in R^3 is SI does not hold in general. The right analogue to Miyoshi's
theorem is also proved, implying in particular the surprising result that no
knot in R^3 is SI. Our results applied to the theory of foliations of Euclidean
spaces give rise to some striking corollaries: using some topological
invariants we classify all the submanifolds of R^n which can be realized as
proper leaves of foliations; we prove that S^3 can be realized as a leaf of a
foliation of R^n, n\geq 7, but not in R^5 or R^6, which partially answers a
question by Vogt (Math. Ann. 1993); we construct open 3-manifolds which cannot
be leaves of a foliation of any compact 4-manifold but are proper leaves in
R^4. The theory of WI and SI submanifolds is a framework where many classical
tools of differential and algebraic topology play a prominent role:
h-principle, complete intersections and the theory of immersions and
embeddings.

Most of the protein footprinting studies so far have been performed on
individual proteins in vitro. We explore whether a similar approach is possible
with the proteins inside of living cells, employing dimethylsulfate (DMS), a
reagent widely used for the in vivo footprinting of nucleic acids. DMS can
induce methylation of the lysine, histidine and glutamate residues on proteins.
Using models of the histone H2B/H2AZ heterodimer assembled in vitro and from
chromatin treated in vivo, we show that the methylation by deuterated DMS
allows one to distinguish the accessibility of a particular residue in and out
of the protein's environmental/structural context. The detection of changes in
protein conformations or their interactions in vivo can provide a new approach
to the identification of proteins involved in various intracellular pathways

study how in- ner slopes of relaxed LCDM dark matter (DM) halos with and
without baryons (baryons+DM, and pure DM) depend on redshift and on halo mass.
We apply the quoted method to structures on galactic scales and clusters of
galaxies scales. We find that the inner logarithmic density slope, of dark
matter halos with baryons has a significant dependence on halo mass and
redshift with slopes ranging from 0 for dwarf galaxies to 0.4 for objects of M
= 10^13M_solar and 0.94 for M = 10^15M_solar clusters of galaxies. Structures
slopes increase with increasing redshift and this trend reduces going from
galaxies to clusters. In the case of density profiles constituted just of dark
matter the mass and redshift dependence of slope is very slight. In this last
case, we used the Merrit et al. (2006) analysis who compared N-body density
profiles with various parametric models finding systematic variation in profile
shape with halo mass. This last analysis suggests that the galaxy-sized halos
obtained with our model have a different shape parameter, i.e. a different mass
distribution, than the cluster-sized halos, obtained with the same model. The
results of the present paper argue against universality of density profiles
constituted by dark matter and baryons and confirm claims of a systematic
variation in profile shape with halo mass, for dark matter halos.

different. For the case $\bar{B_{d}^0} \rightarrow \, \pi^+ \pi^- $ there is a
substantial factorized contribution which dominates. In contrast, the decay
mode $\bar{B_{d}^0} \rightarrow \, \pi^0 \pi^{0} $ has a small factorized

However, for the decay mode $\bar{B_{d}^0} \rightarrow \, \pi^0 \pi^{0} $ there
is a sizeable nonfactorizable (color suppressed) contribution due to soft (long
distance) interactions, which dominate the amplitude. We estimate the branching
ratio for the mode $\bar{B_{d}^0} \rightarrow \, \pi^0 \pi^{0} $ in the heavy
quark limit for the $b$- quark. In order to estimate color suppressed
contributions we treat the energetic light ($u,d,s$) quark within a variant of
Large Energy Effective Theory combined with a recent extension of chiral quark
models in terms of model- dependent gluon condensates. We find that our
calculated color suppressed amplitude is suppressed by a factor of order
$\Lambda_{QCD}/m_b$ with respect to the factorizable amplitude, as it should
according to QCD-factorization. Further, for reasonable values of the
constituent quark mass and the gluon condensate, the calculated nonfactorizable
amplitude for $\bar{B_{d}^0} \rightarrow \, \pi^0 \pi^{0} $ can easily
accomodate the experimental value. Unfortunately, the color suppressed
amplitude is very sensitive to the values of these model dependent parameters.
Therefore fine-tuning is necessary in order to obtain an amplitude compatible
with the experimental result for $\bar{B_{d}^0} \rightarrow \, \pi^0 \pi^{0} $.

(e.g., an ion chain) exhibits a structural phase transition from a linear chain

increasing the particle density. Since it is a one dimensional transition, it
takes place at zero temperature and therefore quantum fluctuations dominate. In
[Fishman, et al., Phys. Rev. B 77, 064111 (2008)] it was shown that the system
close to the linear-zigzag instability is described by a $\phi^4$ model. We
propose a mapping of the $\phi^4$ field theory to the well known Ising chain in
a transverse field, which exhibits a quantum critical point. Based on this
mapping, we estimate the quantum critical point in terms of the system
parameters. This estimate gives the critical value of the transverse trap
frequency for which the quantum phase transition occurs, and which has a
finite, measurable deviation from the critical point evaluated within the
classical theory. A measurement is suggested for atomic systems which can probe
the critical trap frequency at sufficiently low temperatures T. We focus in
particular on a trapped ion system, and estimate the implied limitations on T
and on the interparticle distance. We conclude that the experimental
observation of the quantum critical behavior is in principle accessible.

extended radio emission that is likely associated with the optical

detectable radio core emission. Among these 63 AGN, we found 6 giant radio
galaxies (GRGs), with projected emission exceeding 750 kpc in length, and
several other AGN with unusual radio morphologies also seen in higher redshift

that of typical broad line radio galaxy spectra, having broad H$\alpha$

appear as a population separate from the extended sources, with a dividing line

particular the Ramsey property that every finite colouring of unordered pairs
of integers has a homogeneous set in U, and the equivalent property that every
function is nondecreasing on some set in U. Natural weakenings of these
properties led to the inequivalent notions of weakly Ramsey and of
quasi-selective ultrafilter, introduced and studied in [1] and [4],
respectively. U is weakly Ramsey if for every finite colouring of unordered
pairs of integers there is a set in U whose pairs share only two colours, while
U is f-quasi-selective if every function g < f is nondecreasing on some set in
U. (So the quasi-selective ultrafilters of [4] are here id-quasi selective.) In
this paper we consider the relations between various natural cuts of the
ultrapowers of N modulo weakly Ramsey and f-quasi-selective ultrafilters. In
particular we characterize those weakly Ramsey ultrafilters that are isomorphic

active material. High granularity is obtained by segmenting the scintillator
into small tiles individually read out via silicon photo-multipliers (SiPM).
  A prototype has been built, consisting of thirty-eight sensitive layers,
segmented into about eight thousand channels. In 2007 the prototype was exposed
to positrons and hadrons using the CERN SPS beam, covering a wide range of beam
energies and incidence angles. The challenge of cell equalization and
calibration of such a large number of channels is best validated using
electromagnetic processes.

linearity and uniformity, to electrons is investigated and described.

and a gradual low-energy emission component, whose relationship is one of the
key issues of solar flare study. The gradual and impulsive emission components
are believed to be associated with, respectively, the thermal and nonthermal
components identified in spectral fitting. In this paper, a prominent about 50
second hard X-ray (HXR) pulse of a simple GOES class C7.5 flare on 20 February
2002 is used to study the association between high energy, non-thermal and
impulsive evolution, and low energy, thermal and gradual evolution. We use
regularized methods to obtain time derivatives of photon fluxes to quantify the
time evolution as a function of photon energy, obtaining a break energy between
impulsive and gradual behavior. These break energies are consistent with a
constant value of about 11 keV in agreement with those found spectroscopically
between thermal and non-thermal components, but the relative errors of the
former are greater than 15% and much greater than the a few percent errors
found from the spectral fitting. These errors only weakly depend on assuming an
underlying spectral model for the photons, pointing to the current data being
inadequate to reduce the uncertainties rather than there being a problem
associated with an assumed model. The time derivative method is used to test
for the presence of a 'pivot energy' in this flare. Although these pivot
energies are marginally consistent with a constant value of about 9 keV, its
values in the HXR rise phase appear to be lower than those in the decay phase.

patterns of vorticity-aligned stripes when sheared in confined geometries. We
report a thorough experimental investigation of such shear-induced vorticity
alignment through direct visualization of carbon black gels in both simple
plane shear and rotational shear cells. Control parameters such as the gap
width, the strain rate, and the gel concentration are systematically varied. It
is shown that in steady states the wavelength of the striped pattern depends
linearly on the gap width $h$ while being insensitive to both the gel
concentration $C$ and the shear rate $\gp$. The width of the vorticity-aligned
flocs coincides with the gap width and is also independent of $C$ and $\gp$,
which hints to a simple picture in terms of compressible cylindrical flocs.
Finally, we show that there exists a critical shear rate $\gp_c$ above which
structuration does not occur and that $\gp_c$ scales as $h^{-\alpha}$ with
$\alpha=1.4\pm 0.1$ independently of $C$. This extensive data set should open
the way to quantitative modelling of the vorticity alignment phenomenon in
attractive colloidal systems.

appropriate local field redefinitions, and do not contribute to physical
scattering-matrix elements. We illustrate this observation in the context of
open string theory, where the effective action includes, among other terms, the
well-known Born-Infeld form of non-linear electrodynamics. We conclude that the

metallicity the trend of [S/Fe] against [Fe/H] is controversial. Below
[Fe/H]=-2.0, [S/Fe] remains constant or it decreases with [Fe/H], depending on
the author and the multiplet used in the analysis. Moreover, although sulfur is
not significantly bound in dust grains in the ISM, it seems to behave
differently in DLAs and in old metal-poor stars. We aim to determine precise S
abundance in a sample of extremely metal-poor stars taking into account NLTE
and 3D effects. NLTE profiles of the lines of the multiplet 1 of SI have been
computed using a new model atom for S. We find sulfur in EMP stars to behave
like the other alpha-elements, with [S/Fe] remaining approximately constant for
[Fe/H]<-3. However, [S/Mg] seems to decrease slightly as a function of [Mg/H].
The overall abundance patterns of O, Na, Mg, Al, S, and K are best matched by
the SN model yields by Heger & Woosley. The [S/Zn] ratio in EMP stars is solar,
as found also in DLAs. We obtain an upper limit on the abundance of sulfur,
[S/Fe] < +0.5, for the ultra metal-poor star CS 22949-037. This, along with a
previous reported measurement of zinc, argues against the conjecture that the
light-element abundances pattern in this star, and, by analogy, the hyper
metal-poor stars HE 0107-5240 and HE 1327-2326, are due to dust depletion.

surrounded by a flat FRW universe cannot be arbitrarily large as otherwise the
region would close up on itself and become a separate universe. From this
result they derived a condition connecting size and density of the overdense
region ensuring that it is part of our universe. Carr used this condition to
obtain an upper bound for the density fluctuation amplitude with the property
that for smaller amplitudes the formation of a primordial black hole is
possible, while larger ones indicate a separate universe. In contrast, we find
that the appearance of a maximum is not a consequence of avoiding separate
universes but arises naturally from the geometry of the chosen slicing. Using
instead of density a volume fluctuation variable reveals that a fluctuation is
a separate universe iff this variable diverges on superhorizon scales. Hence
Carr's and Hawking's condition does not pose a physical constraint on density
fluctuations. The dynamics of primordial black hole formation with an initial
curvature fluctuation amplitude larger than the one corresponding to the
maximum density fluctuation amplitude was previously not considered in detail
and so we compare it to the well-known case where the amplitude is smaller by
presenting embedding and conformal diagrams of both types in dust spacetimes.

tuning the quark masses is discussed here in which the singlet quark mass is
kept fixed, which ensures that the kaon always has mass less than the physical
kaon mass. Using group theory the possible quark mass polynomials for a Taylor
expansion about the flavour symmetric line are found, which enables highly
constrained fits to be used in the extrapolation of hadrons to the physical

frequencies with amplitudes from 14 to 29000 ppm were detected. The two
dominant frequencies at 9.79 and 12.57 c/d (113.3 and 145.5 \mu Hz),
interpreted to be radial modes, are accompanied by a large number of
combination frequencies. A small additional modulation with a 0.16 c/d
frequency is also seen; this is interpreted to be the rotation frequency of the
star. The corresponding prediction of slow rotation is confirmed by a spectrum
from which v sin i = 19 \pm 1 km/s is obtained. The analysis of the spectrum
shows that the star is one of the coolest {\delta} Sct variables. We also
determine Teff = 6700 \pm 100 K and log g = 3.7 \pm 0.1, compatible with the
observed frequencies of the radial modes. Normal solar abundances are found. An
\ell = 2 frequency quintuplet is also detected with a frequency separation
consistent with predictions from the measured rotation rate. A remarkable
result is the absence of additional independent frequencies down to an
amplitude limit near 14 ppm, suggesting that the star is stable against most
forms of nonradial pulsation. The frequency spectrum of this star emphasizes
the need for caution in interpreting low frequencies in {\delta} Sct stars as
independent gravity modes. A low frequency peak at 2.7763 c/d in KIC 9700322
is, in fact, the frequency difference between the two dominant modes and is
repeated over and over in various frequency combinations involving the two
dominant modes. The relative phases of the combination frequencies show a
strong correlation with frequency, but the physical significance of this result
is not clear.
