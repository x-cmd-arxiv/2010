gas made up of indistinguishable particles when the box is kept in various
static background spacetimes having a horizon. We compute the thermodynamic
variables using both statistical mechanics as well as by solving the
hydrodynamical equations for the system. When the box is far away from the
horizon, the entropy of the gas depends on the volume of the box except for
small corrections due to background geometry. As the box is moved closer to the
horizon with one (leading) edge of the box at about Planck length (L_p) away
from the horizon, the entropy shows an area dependence rather than a volume
dependence. More precisely, it depends on a small volume A*L_p/2 of the box,
upto an order O(L_p/K)^2 where A is the transverse area of the box and K is the
(proper) longitudinal size of the box related to the distance between leading
and trailing edge in the vertical direction (i.e in the direction of the
gravitational field). Thus the contribution to the entropy comes from only a
fraction O(L_p/K) of the matter degrees of freedom and the rest are suppressed
when the box approaches the horizon. Near the horizon all the thermodynamical
quantities behave as though the box of gas has a volume A*L_p/2 and is kept in
a Minkowski spacetime. These effects are: (i) purely kinematic in their origin
and are independent of the spacetime curvature (in the sense that Rindler
approximation of the metric near the horizon can reproduce the results) and
(ii) observer dependent. When the equilibrium temperature of the gas is taken
to be equal to the the horizon temperature, we get the familiar A/L_p^2
dependence in the expression for entropy. All these results hold in a D+1
dimensional spherically symmetric spacetime.

levels are easy to increase but are hard to decrease. In a general rewriting
model, the stored data changes its value with certain patterns. The patterns of
data updates are determined by the data structure and the application, and are
independent of the constraints imposed by the storage medium. Thus, an
appropriate coding scheme is needed so that the data changes can be updated and
stored efficiently under the storage-medium's constraints.
  In this paper, we define the general rewriting problem using a graph model.
It extends many known rewriting models such as floating codes, WOM codes,
buffer codes, etc. We present a new rewriting scheme for flash memories, called
the trajectory code, for rewriting the stored data as many times as possible
without block erasures. We prove that the trajectory code is asymptotically
optimal in a wide range of scenarios.
  We also present randomized rewriting codes optimized for expected performance
(given arbitrary rewriting sequences). Our rewriting codes are shown to be
asymptotically optimal.

anyons (quasiparticles of fractional statistics) in (2+1)-D. The anyons that
can exist in a physical theory are determined by the symmetry group of the
Hamiltonian. In the case that the Hamiltonian undergoes spontaneous symmetry
breaking of the full symmetry group G to a finite residual gauge group H,
particles are given by representations of the quantum double $D(H)$ of the
subgroup. The quasi-triangular Hopf Algebra D(H) is obtained from Drinfeld's
quantum double construction applied to the algebra F(H) of functions on the
finite group H.
  A major new contribution of this work is a program written in MAGMA to
compute the particles (and their properties - including spin) that can exist in
a system with an arbitrary finite residual gauge group, in addition to the
braiding and fusion rules for those particles. We compute explicitly the fusion
rules for two non-abelian group doubles suggested for universal quantum
computation: $S_3$ and $A_5$, and discover some interesting results,
subsystems, and symmetries in the tables. SO(3)_4 (the restriction of
Chern-Simons theory $SU(2)_4$) and its mirror image are discovered as
3-particle subsystems in the 8-particle $S_3$ quantum double. The tables
demonstrate that both $S_3$ and $A_5$ anyons are all Majorana, but this is not
the case for all finite groups. In the appendices, the quantum doubles for the
remaining nonabelian subgroups of SO(3) - $S_4$, $A_4$, and $D_4$ (the second
in the infinite family $D_n$) - are tabulated and analyzed. In addition, the
probabilities of obtaining any given fusion product in quantum computation

three-dimensional aspect of the problem arises from the Stokes parameters Q, U,
and V, which completely describe the polarization of electromagnetic radiation
and conceptually define the orientation of a polarization vector in the
Poincar'e sphere. The statistical aspect of the problem arises from the random
fluctuations in the source-intrinsic polarization and the instrumental noise. A
simple model for the polarization of pulsar radio emission has been used to
derive the three-dimensional statistics of radio polarimetry. The model is
based upon the proposition that the observed polarization is due to the
incoherent superposition of two, highly polarized, orthogonal modes. The
directional statistics derived from the model follow the Bingham-Mardia and
Fisher family of distributions. The model assumptions are supported by the
qualitative agreement between the statistics derived from it and those measured
with polarization observations of the individual pulses from pulsars. The
orthogonal modes are thought to be the natural modes of radio wave propagation
in the pulsar magnetosphere. The intensities of the modes become statistically
independent when generalized Faraday rotation (GFR) in the magnetosphere causes
the difference in their phases to be large. A stochastic version of GFR occurs
when fluctuations in the phase difference are also large, and may be
responsible for the more complicated polarization patterns observed in pulsar
radio emission.

the Lagrangian formalism. A very simple model includes only relativistic
kinetic energy by defining a Lagrangian that is consistent with both the
relativistic momentum of Special Relativity and Newtonian gravity. The
corresponding equations of motion are solved in a Keplerian limit, resulting in
an approximate relativistic orbit equation that has the same form as that
derived from General Relativity in the same limit and clearly describes three
characteristics of relativistic Keplerian orbits: precession of perihelion;
reduced radius of circular orbit; and increased eccentricity. The prediction
for the rate of precession of perihelion is in agreement with established
calculations using only Special Relativity. All three characteristics are
qualitatively correct, though suppressed when compared to more accurate
general-relativistic calculations. This model is improved upon by including
relativistic gravitational potential energy. The resulting approximate
relativistic orbit equation has the same form and symmetry as that derived
using the very simple model, and more accurately describes characteristics of
relativistic orbits. For example, the prediction for the rate of precession of
perihelion of Mercury is one-third that derived from General Relativity. These
Lagrangian formulations of the special-relativistic Kepler problem are
equivalent to the familiar vector calculus formulations. In this Keplerian

nonspecialists whom have not had a course dedicated to relativity.

feature such competing interactions. A Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY)
exchange interaction among the local moments promotes magnetic ordering.
However, a Kondo exchange interaction between the local moments and conduction
electrons favors the Kondo-screened singlet ground state. This chapter
summarizes the basic physics of QPTs in antiferromagnetic Kondo lattice
systems. Two types of quantum critical points (QCPs) are considered.
Spin-density-wave quantum criticality occurs at a conventional type of QCP,
which invokes only the fluctuations of the antiferromagnetic order parameter.
Local quantum criticality describes a new type of QCP, which goes beyond the
Landau paradigm and involves a breakdown of the Kondo effect. This critical
Kondo breakdown effect leads to non-Fermi liquid electronic excitations, which
are part of the critical excitation spectrum and are in addition to the
fluctuations of the magnetic order parameter. Across such a QCP, there is a
sudden collapse of the Fermi surface from large to small. I close with a brief
summary of relevant experiments, and outline a number of outstanding issues,

growth rate in Galileon models is enhanced compared with the $\Lambda$CDM case,
due to the enhancement of Newton's constant. The smaller $\Omega_{m,0}$ is, the
more suppressed growth rate is. Hence the best fit value of $\Omega_{m,0}$ in
the Galileon model is 0.16 from only the growth rate data, which is
considerably smaller than such value obtained from observations of supernovae
Ia, the cosmic microwave background and baryon acoustic oscillations. This
result seems to be qualitatively the same in most of the generalized Galileon
models. We also find the upper limit of the Brans-Dicke parameter to be $\omega
< -40$, from the growth rate data. More and better growth rate data are
required to distinguish between dark energy and modified gravity.

quality information is above a certain fixed threshold. Strong users send the

base station via compressive sensing. Both analog and digital feedbacks are
considered. The proposed analog & digital opportunistic feedback schemes are
shown to achieve the same sum-rate throughput as that achieved by dedicated

number of users. Moreover, there is also a reduction in the feedback load. In
the analog feedback case, we show that the proposed scheme reduces the feedback
noise which eventually results in better throughput, whereas in the digital

For the systems, the two cases, namely with and without neutron emission
corrections were considered. In these calculations, it is assumed that all the

quadrupole transitions, the contribution of which can be considerably enhanced
as compared to the case of photoionization. To obtain these matrix elements one
has to study the angular distribution of electrons emitted by the atom in its
collision with a fast charged particle. The distribution has to be measured
relative to the momentum q transferred from the projectile to the target atom.
The situation is similar, but not identical to the photoionization studies,
where the matrix elements of continuous spectrum atomic quadrupole transitions
can be determined by measuring the so-called non-dipole angular anisotropy
parameters of photoelectrons. However, they are strongly suppressed as compared
to the dipole matrix elements by small ratio of atomic size to the photon
wavelength. This suppression is controlled in fast electron-atom collisions,
where it can be much less than in photoionization since the respective virtual
photon wavelength can be much smaller than in photoionization. We present not
only general formulas, but also concrete results of calculations for noble gas
atoms He, Ar and Xe. We have investigated their outer and subvalent subshells,

value, the dynamics of domain wall exhibits the novel screw-pitch effect
characterized by the temporal oscillation of domain wall velocity and width,
respectively. Both the theoretical analysis and numerical simulation
demonstrate that this novel phenomenon arise from the conjunctive action of
Gilbert-damping and spin-transfer torque. We also find that the roles of
spin-transfer torque are entirely contrary for the cases of below and above the
critical current.

Quantum Monte Carlo calculations at finite temperature T/\epsilon_F as well as

C/k^4, in agreement with the Tan relations. From the asymptotics of n(k), we
determine the contact C as a function of T/\epsilon_F and present a comparison
with theory. At low T/\epsilon_F, we find that C increases with temperature,
and we tentatively identify a maximum around T/\epsilon_F \simeq 0.4. Our

are assigned in a linearly decreasing/increasing fashion depending upon the

Ising-Heisenberg model on a triangulated Kagome lattice are analyzed by means
of variational mean-field like treatment based on Gibbs-Bogoliubov inequality.
Because of the separable character of Ising-type exchange interactions between
the Heisenberg trimers the calculation of quantum entanglement in a
self-consistent field can be performed for each of the trimers individually.
The concurrence in terms of three qubit isotropic Heisenberg model in effective
Ising field is non-zero even in the absence of a magnetic field. The magnetic
and entanglement properties exhibit common (plateau and peak) features
observable via (antferromagnetic) coupling constant and external magnetic
field. The critical temperature for the phase transition and threshold
temperature for concurrence coincide in the case of antiferromagnetic coupling
between qubits. The existence of entangled and disentangled phases in saturated
and frustrated phases is established.

body and an unsteady compressible fluid flow, using an Embedded Boundary
method. The coupling with a rigid body is a first step towards the coupling
with a Discrete Element method. The flow is computed using a Finite Volume
approach on a Cartesian grid. The expression of numerical fluxes does not
affect the general coupling algorithm and we use a one-step high-order scheme
proposed by Daru and Tenaud [Daru V,Tenaud C., J. Comput. Phys. 2004]. The
Embedded Boundary method is used to integrate the presence of a solid boundary
in the fluid. The coupling algorithm is totally explicit and ensures exact mass
conservation and a balance of momentum and energy between the fluid and the
solid. It is shown that the scheme preserves uniform movement of both fluid and
solid and introduces no numerical boundary roughness. The effciency of the
method is demonstrated on challenging one- and two-dimensional benchmarks.
