Walraven photometric system. We solved the complete Baade-Wesselink equation by
calibrating the surface brightness function with a recent grid of atmosphere
models. The new approach was adopted to estimate the mean radii of a sample of
Galactic Cepheids for which are available precise light curves in the Walraven
bands. Current radii agree, within the errors, quite well with Cepheid radii
based on recent optical and near-infrared interferometric measurements. We also
tested the impact of the projection factor on the Period-Radius relation using
two different values (p=1.36, p=1.27) that bracket the estimates available in
the literature. We found that the agreement of our Period-Radius relation with
similar empirical and theoretical Period-Radius relations in the recent
literature, improves by changing the projection factor from p=1.36 to p=1.27.
Our Period-Radius relation is log(R)=(0.75\pm 0.03)log(P)+(1.10 \pm 0.03), with
a rms=0.03 dex. Thanks to accurate estimates of the effective temperature of
the selected Cepheids, we also derived the Period-Luminosity relation in the V
band and we found Mv=(-2.78 \pm 0.11)log(P)+(-1.42 \pm 0.11) with rms=0.13 mag,
for p=1.27. It agrees quite well with recent results in the literature, while
the relation for p=1.36 deviates by more than 2sigma. We conclude that, even
taking into account the intrinsic dispersion of the obtained Period-Luminosity
relations, that is roughly of the same order of magnitude as the effect of the
projection factor, the results of this paper seem to favour the value p = 1.27.

computational scaling with the system size. Here, we show that HEOM are also
solvable for larger systems, since the underlying algorithm is ideally suited

dynamically-interacting multiple giant planets can explain the large gaps
(spanning over one order of magnitude in radius) inferred for the transitional
and pre-transitional disks around T Tauri stars. In the absence of inner disk
dust depletion, we find that it requires three to four giant planets to open up
large enough gaps to be consistent with inferences from spectral energy
distributions, because the gap width is limited by the tendency of the planets
to be driven together into 2:1 resonances. With very strong tidal torques
and/or rapid planetary accretion, fewer planets can also generate a large
cavity interior to the locally formed gap(s) by preventing outer disk material
from moving in. In these cases, however, the reduction of surface density
produces a corresponding reduction in the inner disk accretion rate onto the
star; this makes it difficult to explain the observed accretion rates of the
pre/transitional disks. We find that even with four planets in disks,
additional substantial dust depletion is required to explain observed disk
gaps/holes. Substantial dust settling and growth, with consequent significant
reductions in optical depths, is inferred for typical T Tauri disks in any
case, and an earlier history of dust growth is consistent with the hypothesis
that pre/transitional disks are explained by the presence of giant planets. We
conclude that the depths and widths of gaps, and disk accretion rates in
pre/transitional disks cannot be reproduced by a planet-induced gap opening

analysis and the understanding of complex networks' dynamics. A major issue is
the definition of new frameworks for the exploration of the dynamics at play in
real dynamic networks. Here, we focus on scientific communities by analyzing
the ""social part"" of Science through a descriptive approach that aims at
identifying the social determinants (e.g. goals and potential interactions
among individuals) behind the emergence and the resilience of scientific
communities. We consider that scientific communities are at the same time
communities of practice (through co-authorship) and that they exist also as
representations in the scientists' mind, since references to other scientists'
works is not merely an objective link to a relevant work, but it reveals social
objects that one manipulates and refers to. In this paper we identify the
patterns about the evolution of a scientific field by analyzing a portion of
the arXiv repository covering a period of 10 years of publications in physics.
As a citation represents a deliberative selection related to the relevance of a
work in its scientific domain, our analysis approaches the co-existence between
co-authorship and citation behaviors in a community by focusing on the most
proficient and cited authors interactions patterns. We focus in turn, on how
these patterns are affected by the selection process of citations. Such a
selection a) produces self-organization because it is played by a group of
individuals which act, compete and collaborate in a common environment in order
to advance Science and b) determines the success (emergence) of both topics and
scientists working on them. The dataset is analyzed a) at a global level, e.g.
the network evolution, b) at the meso-level, e.g. communities emergence, and c)
at a micro-level, e.g. nodes' aggregation patterns.

becomes very challenging under arbitrary dependence. In the current paper, we
propose a new methodology based on principal factor approximation, which
successfully substracts the common dependence and weakens significantly the
correlation structure, to deal with an arbitrary dependence structure. We
derive the theoretical distribution for false discovery proportion (FDP) in
large scale multiple testing when a common threshold is used and provide a
consistent FDP. This result has important applications in controlling FDR and

that will be able to ""activate"" a prescribed number of vertices in the graph is
called the target set selection problem (TSS) proposed by Kempe, Kleinberg, and
Tardos. In TSS's settings, nodes have two possible states (active or
non-active) and the threshold triggering the activation of a node is given by
the number of its active neighbors. Dealing with fault tolerance in a majority
based system the two possible states are used to denote faulty or non-faulty
nodes, and the threshold is given by the state of the majority of neighbors.
Here, the major effort was in determining the distribution of initial faults
leading the entire system to a faulty behavior. Such an activation pattern,
also known as dynamic monopoly (or shortly dynamo), was introduced by Peleg in
1996. In this paper we extend the TSS problem's settings by representing nodes'
states with a ""multicolored"" set. The extended version of the problem can be
described as follows: let G be a simple connected graph where every node is
assigned a color from a finite ordered set C = {1, . . ., k} of colors. At each
local time step, each node can recolor itself, depending on the local
configurations, with the color held by the majority of its neighbors. Given G,
we study the initial distributions of colors leading the system to a k
monochromatic configuration in toroidal meshes, focusing on the minimum number
of initial k-colored nodes. We find upper and lower bounds to the size of a
dynamo, and then special classes of dynamos, outlined by means of a new
approach based on recoloring patterns, are characterized.

asymptotically as ${\it s}\sim E^{(1+\alpha)/2(1-\alpha)}$; for a charged

mechanics keeps on the old one about the aim of science, which was between the
founders of the quantum theory. The orthodox quantum mechanics could be created
only at the cost of renunciation of reality as the aim of natural science. The
description only of phenomena, i.e. results of observation, should not be
universal if no one believes that these phenomena are manifestation of a unique
reality. Such belief concerning quantum mechanics is quite unacceptable because
of irremediably conflict with special relativity. Nevertheless the quantum
mechanics was developed and apprehended by most physicists as a universal
theory of a quantum world. This fundamental discrepancy between the essence of
the orthodox quantum mechanics and its history of development and studying has
resulted both to an illusion about the aim of its description among most
physicists and to the consideration of its fundamental obscurity as a universal
problem among experts in quantum foundation. The aim of this paper is to show
that quantum phenomena can not be described universally. It is indicated that
rather the Schrodinger's than Born's interpretation of the wave function is
valid for description of many quantum phenomena. The fundamental obscurity with
which we are faced at the description, for example, macroscopic quantum
phenomena differs fundamentally from the one with which the founders of the
quantum theory were faced on atomic level.

emission-line classification of SDSS galaxies. This classification is able to
cope with the large population of weak line galaxies that do not appear in
traditional diagrams due to a lack of some of the diagnostic lines. A further
advantage of the WHAN diagram is to allow the differentiation between two very
distinct classes that overlap in the LINER region of traditional diagnostic
diagrams. These are galaxies hosting a weakly active nucleus (wAGN) and
""retired galaxies"" (RGs), i.e. galaxies that have stopped forming stars and are
ionized by their hot evolved low-mass stars. A useful criterion to distinguish
true from fake AGN (i.e. the RGs) is the ratio (\xi) of the
extinction-corrected L_Ha with respect to the Ha luminosity expected from
photoionization by stellar populations older than 100 Myr. This ratio follows a
markedly bimodal distribution, with a \xi >> 1 population composed by systems
undergoing star-formation and/or nuclear activity, and a peak at \xi ~ 1
corresponding to the prediction of the RG model. We base our classification
scheme on the equivalent width of Ha, an excellent observational proxy for \xi.
Based on the bimodal distribution of W_Ha, we set the division between wAGN and
RGs at W_Ha = 3 A. Five classes of galaxies are identified within the WHAN
diagram: (a) Pure star forming galaxies: log [NII]/Ha < -0.4 and W_Ha > 3 A.
(b) Strong AGN (i.e., Seyferts): log [NII]/Ha > -0.4 and W_Ha > 6 A. (c) Weak
AGN: log [NII]/Ha > -0.4 and W_Ha between 3 and 6 A. (d) RGs: W_Ha < 3 A. (e)
Passive galaxies (actually, line-less galaxies): W_Ha and W_[NII] < 0.5 A. A
comparative analysis of star formation histories and of other properties in
these different classes of galaxies corroborates our proposed differentiation
between RGs and weak AGN in the LINER-like family. (Abridged)

systems, with a double-exponentially small gap in acceptance probability
between the completeness and soundness cases, is precisely characterized by
EXP, the class of problems solvable in exponential time by deterministic Turing
machines. This fact, and our proof of it, has implications concerning quantum
and classical interactive proof systems in the setting of unbounded error that
include the following:
  * Quantum interactive proof systems are strictly more powerful than their
classical counterparts in the unbounded-error setting unless PSPACE=EXP, as
even unbounded error classical interactive proof systems can be simulated in
PSPACE.
  * The recent proof of Jain, Ji, Upadhyay, and Watrous (STOC 2010)
establishing QIP=PSPACE relies heavily on the fact that the quantum interactive
proof systems defining the class QIP have bounded error. Our result implies
that some nontrivial assumption on the error bounds for quantum interactive
proofs is unavoidable to establish this result (unless PSPACE=EXP).
  * To prove our result, we give a quantum interactive proof system for EXP
with perfect completeness and soundness error 1-2^{-2^poly}, for which the
soundness error bound is provably tight. This establishes another respect in
which quantum and classical interactive proof systems differ, because such a
bound cannot hold for any classical interactive proof system: distinct
acceptance probabilities for classical interactive proof systems must be
separated by a gap that is at least (single-)exponentially small.

regularisation term which removes clusters from the system when their mass
exceeds a specified cut-off size, M. We focus primarily on collision kernels
which would exhibit an instantaneous gelation transition in the absence of any
regularisation. Numerical simulations demonstrate that for such kernels with
monodisperse initial data, the regularised gelation time decreases as M
increases, consistent with the expectation that the gelation time is zero in
the unregularised system. This decrease appears to be a logarithmically slow
function of M, indicating that instantaneously gelling kernels may still be
justifiable as physical models despite the fact that they are highly singular
in the absence of a cut-off. We also study the case when a source of monomers
is introduced in the regularised system. In this case a stationary state is
reached. We present a complete analytic description of this regularised
stationary state for the model kernel, K(m_1,m_2)=max{m_1,m_2}^v, which gels
instantaneously when M tends to infinity if v>1. The stationary cluster size
distribution decays as a stretched exponential for small cluster sizes and
crosses over to a power law decay with exponent v for large cluster sizes. The
total particle density in the stationary state slowly vanishes as (Log
M^(v-1))^-1/2 when M gets large. The approach to the stationary state is
non-trivial : oscillations about the stationary state emerge from the interplay
between the monomer injection and the cut-off, M, which decay very slowly when
M is large. A quantitative analysis of these oscillations is provided for the
addition model which describes the situation in which clusters can only grow by
absorbing monomers.

degenerate Bose gas are analysed in two and three spatial dimensions. For such
systems, universal power-law distributions, previously found within a
nonperturbative quantum-field theoretic approach, are shown to be related to
vortical dynamics and superfluid turbulence. The results imply an
interpretation of the momentum scaling at the nonthermal fixed points in terms
of independent vortex excitations of the superfluid. Long-wavelength acoustic
excitations on the top of these are found to follow a non-thermal power law.
The results shed light on fundamental aspects of superfluid turbulence and have
strong potential implications for related phenomena studied, e.g., in
early-universe inflation or quark-gluon plasma dynamics.

the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager (AMI) 'blind', degree-square fields to have
been observed down to our target sensitivity of 100{\mu}Jy/beam. In follow-up
deep pointed observations the SZ effect is detected with a maximum peak
decrement greater than 8 \times the thermal noise. No corresponding emission is
visible in the ROSAT all-sky X-ray survey and no cluster is evident in the
Palomar all-sky optical survey. Compared with existing SZ images of distant
clusters, the extent is large (\approx 10') and complex; our analysis favours a
model containing two clusters rather than a single cluster. Our Bayesian
analysis is currently limited to modelling each cluster with an ellipsoidal or
spherical beta-model, which do not do justice to this decrement. Fitting an
ellipsoid to the deeper candidate we find the following. (a) Assuming that the
Evrard et al. (2002) approximation to Press & Schechter (1974) correctly gives
the number density of clusters as a function of mass and redshift, then, in the
search area, the formal Bayesian probability ratio of the AMI detection of this
cluster is 7.9 \times 10^4:1; alternatively assuming Jenkins et al. (2001) as
the true prior, the formal Bayesian probability ratio of detection is 2.1
\times 10^5:1. (b) The cluster mass is MT,200 = 5.5+1.2\times 10^14h-1M\odot.
(c) Abandoning a physical model with num- -1.3 70 ber density prior and instead
simply modelling the SZ decrement using a phenomenological {\beta}-model of
temperature decrement as a function of angular distance, we find a central SZ
temperature decrement of -295+36 {\mu}K - this allows for CMB primary
anisotropies, receiver -15 noise and radio sources. We are unsure if the
cluster system we observe is a merging system or two separate clusters.

the behavior of this effective coupling beyond leading order. The dependence of

order to study the asymptotic behavior of the running gluon mass. The deep
inelastic structure function $F_{2}$ obtained in this approach shows very good

new peak emerges above the frequency of the undriven exciton peak which grows

intensity is inconsistent with the Autler-Townes effect in a three-state system

all of comparable magnitude. Solution of a semiconductor Bloch model with one
conduction and multiple valence subbands indicates that the AC Stark effect is

attraction of the particles towards this high flow rate branch. In this paper,
we focus on the existence of such an attraction through microfluidic
experiments and two-dimensional simulations and show clearly that such an
attraction does not occur but is, on the contrary, directed towards the low
flow rate branch. Arguments for this attraction are given and a discussion on
the sometimes misleading arguments found in the literature is proposed.
Finally, the enrichment in particles in the high flow rate branch is shown to
be mainly a consequence of the initial distribution in the inlet branch, which
shows necessarily some depletion near the walls.

(naphthalene up to heptacene) are investigated using range-separated methods
within time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). In these rather simple
systems, it is well-known that TDDFT methods using conventional hybrid
functionals surprisingly fail in describing the low-lying La and Lb valence
states, resulting in large, growing errors for the La state and an incorrect
energetic ordering as a function of molecular size. In this work, we
demonstrate that the range-separated formalism largely eliminates both of these
errors and also provides a consistent description of excitonic properties in
these systems. We further demonstrate that re-optimizing the percentage of
Hartree-Fock exchange in conventional hybrids to match wavefunction-based
benchmark calculations still yields serious errors, and a full 100%
Hartree-Fock range separation is essential for simultaneously describing both
of the La and Lb transitions. Based on an analysis of electron-hole transition
density matrices, we finally show that conventional hybrid functionals
overdelocalize excitons and underestimate quasiparticle energy gaps in the
acene systems. The results of our present study emphasize the importance of
both a range-separated and asymptotically-correct contribution of exchange in
TDDFT for investigating optoelectronic and excitonic properties, even for these
simple valence excitations.

clouds from observations made with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph
(STIS) of the Hubble Space Telescope. Our sample of 56 Galactic sight lines is
the result of a complete search of archival STIS data for the B II 1362
resonance line, with each detection confirmed by the presence of absorption
from O I 1355, Cu II 1358, and Ga II 1414 (when available) at the same
velocity. Five previous measurements of interstellar B II from Goddard High
Resolution Spectrograph observations are incorporated in our analysis, yielding
a combined sample that more than quadruples the number of sight lines with
significant boron detections. Our survey also constitutes the first extensive
analysis of interstellar gallium from STIS spectra and expands on previously
published results for oxygen and copper. The observations probe both high and
low-density diffuse environments, allowing the density-dependent effects of
interstellar depletion to be clearly identified in the gas-phase abundance data
for each element. In the case of boron, the increase in relative depletion with
line-of-sight density amounts to an abundance difference of 0.8 dex between the
warm and cold phases of the diffuse interstellar medium. The abundance of boron
in warm, low-density gas is found to be B/H = (2.4+/-0.6)*10^-10, which
represents a depletion of 60% relative to the meteoritic boron abundance.
Beyond the effects of depletion, our survey reveals sight lines with enhanced
boron abundances that potentially trace the recent production of 11B, resulting
from spallation reactions involving either cosmic rays or neutrinos. Future
observations will help to disentangle the relative contributions from the two
spallation channels for 11B synthesis.

detailed hidden-sector particle physics, we characterize the relevant physics
by the annihilation cross section, mass, and temperature ratio of the hidden to

require the freeze-out process to be nonrelativistic. Rather, freeze-out may
also occur when dark matter particles are semirelativistic or relativistic. We
solve the Boltzmann equation to find the conditions that hidden-sector dark
matter accounts for the observed dark-matter density, satisfies the
Tremaine-Gunn bound on dark-matter phase space density, and has a
free-streaming length consistent with cosmological constraints on the matter
power spectrum. We show that for masses <1.5 keV no region of parameter space
satisfies all these constraints. This is a gravitationally-mediated lower bound
on the dark-matter mass for any model in which the primary component of dark
matter once had efficient interactions -- even if it has never been in
equilibrium with the standard model.

key observation is that a heavier mother particle charged under a Z_3
stabilization symmetry can decay into one or two DM particles along with
Standard Model (SM) particles. This can be contrasted with the decay of a
mother particle charged under a parity symmetry; typically, only one DM
particle appears in the decay chain. In arXiv:1003.0899, some of us studied the
distributions of visible invariant mass from the decay of a single such mother
particle in order to highlight the resulting distinctive signatures of Z_3
symmetry versus parity symmetry stabilized dark matter candidates. We now
describe a complementary study which focuses on decay chains of the two mother
particles which are necessarily present in these events. We also include in our
analyss the missing energy/momentum in the event. For the Z_3 symmetry
stabilized mothers, the resulting inclusive final state can have two, three or
four DM particles. In contrast, models with Z_2 symmetry can have only two. We
show that the shapes and edges of the distribution of M_T2-type variables,

slowly with time, by factors of only 1.3 - 2.5 in the past 10^8 yr. In
contrast, the observed age distribution of the clusters declines approximately
as a power law, dN/dt \propto t^{gamma} with gamma = -1.0, for ages 10^6 yr \la

the observed age distribution with exponents in the range -0.9 \la delta \la
-0.6 (with a slightly different delta for each simulation). The similarity
between delta and gamma indicates that dN/dt is shaped mainly by the disruption
of clusters rather than variations in their formation rate. Thus, the situation

In Chen et al. (2009), we used numerical scattering experiments to show that
three-body interactions between bound stars in a stellar cusp and a
non-evolving ""hard"" MBH binary will also produce a burst of tidal disruptions,
caused by a combination of the secular ""Kozai effect"" and by close resonant
encounters with the secondary hole. Here we derive basic analytical scalings of
the stellar disruption rates with the system parameters, assess the relative
importance of the Kozai and resonant encounter mechanisms as a function of
time, discuss the impact of general relativistic (GR) and extended stellar cusp
effects, and develop a hybrid model to self-consistently follow the shrinking
of an MBH binary in a stellar background, including slingshot ejections and
tidal disruptions. In the case of a fiducial binary with primary hole mass
M_1=10^7\msun and mass ratio q=M_2/M_1=1/81, embedded in an isothermal cusp, we
derive a stellar disruption rate \dot{N_*} ~ 0.2/yr lasting ~ 3X10^5 yr. This
rate is 3 orders of magnitude larger than the corresponding value for a single
MBH fed by two-body relaxation, confirming our previous findings. For q<<0.01,
the Kozai/chaotic effect could be quenched due to GR/cusp effects by an order
of magnitude, but even in this case the stellar-disruption rate is still two
orders of magnitude larger than that given by standard relaxation processes
around a single MBH. Our results suggest that >~10% of the tidal-disruption

contrast to the fragile PT-symmetric phase of a chain with constant hopping and
imaginary impurity potentials, we show that, under very general conditions, our

energy spectrum and the density of states of such a chain, and show that they

of its eigenstates are extended. Our results indicate that tight-binding models
with non-Hermitian PT-symmetric hopping have a robust PT-symmetric phase and
rich dynamics which may be explored in coupled waveguides.

nebulae have been done in the literature assuming that the molecule survives
only in regions where the hydrogen is neutral, as in photodissociation, neutral
clumps or shocked regions. However, there is strong observational and
theoretical evidence that at least part of the H2 emission is produced inside
the ionized region of such objects. The aim of the present work is to calculate
and analyze the infrared line emission of H2 produced inside the ionized region
of planetary nebulae using a one-dimensional photoionization code. The
photoionization code Aangaba was improved in order to calculate the statistical
population of the H2 energy levels and the intensity of the H2 infrared
emission lines in physical conditions typical of planetary nebulae. A grid of
models was obtained and the results are analyzed and compared with the
observational data. We show that the contribution of the ionized region to the
H2 line emission can be important, particularly in the case of nebulae with
high temperature central stars. This result explains why H2 emission is more
frequently observed in bipolar planetary nebulae (Gatley's rule), since this
kind of object typically has hotter stars. Collisional excitation plays an
important role on the population of the rovibrational levels of the electronic
ground state of H2. Radiative mechanisms are also important, particularly for
the upper vibrational levels. Formation pumping can have minor effects on the
line intensities produced by de-excitation from very high rotational levels,
especially in dense and dusty environments. We included the effect of the H2 on
the thermal equilibrium of the gas, concluding that H2 only contributes to the
thermal equilibrium in the case of a very high temperature of the central star
or a high dust-to-gas ratio, mainly through collisional de-excitation.

studied using high spatial (~ 100 km) and temporal (~ 30 sec) resolution data
obtained with the IMaX instrument aboard SUNRISE. First, mesogranular cells are
identified using Lagrange tracers (corks) based on horizontal velocity fields
obtained through Local Correlation Tracking. After ~ 20 min of integration, the
tracers delineate a sharp mesogranular network with lanes of width below about
280 km. The preferential location of magnetic elements in mesogranular cells is
tested quantitatively. Roughly 85% of pixels with magnetic field higher than
100 G are located in the near neighborhood of mesogranular lanes. Magnetic flux
is therefore concentrated in mesogranular lanes rather than intergranular ones.
Secondly, magnetic field extrapolations are performed to obtain field lines
anchored in the observed flux elements. This analysis, therefore, is
independent of the horizontal flows determined in the first part. A probability
density function (PDF) is calculated for the distribution of distances between
the footpoints of individual magnetic field lines. The PDF has an exponential
shape at scales between 1 and 10 Mm, with a constant characteristic decay
distance, indicating the absence of preferred convection scales in the
mesogranular range. Our results support the view that mesogranulation is not an
intrinsic convective scale (in the sense that it is not a primary
energy-injection scale of solar convection), but also give quantitative
confirmation that, nevertheless, the magnetic elements are preferentially found
along mesogranular lanes.

propagates through an intracavity fast-light medium. The method of using a
transfer function to determine a pulse after it passes through a cavity is well
known. However, this approach cannot be used to determine the behavior of the
pulse inside the cavity. To circumvent this constraint, we use an approach that
starts by finding a self-consistent solution for a monochromatic field of
infinite spatial and temporal extents, and determine its amplitudes before,
inside, and after the cavity. We then construct a Gaussian input pulse by
adding a set of these waves, properly phased and weighted, to represent a
moving pulse before the cavity. Adding these waves at various time intervals
then yields the complete spatial profile everywhere, including before, inside
and after the cavity. We first confirm the prediction of this model by
analyzing the behavior of a pulse passing through an empty cavity, and
comparing the prediction of the output with the one produced by the transfer
function method. We then apply the technique to a cavity containing a
fast-light medium. The resulting model allows us to visualize the behavior of
the pulse as it propagates superluminally inside the cavity, and interferes
with itself through multiple bounces. For a vanishing group index, an
interference pattern is formed immediately after the pulse enters the cavity,
with an output pulse emerging with no time delay or distortion. The results
obtained here illustrates the physical mechanism behind pulse propagation
through a white light cavity, a process we have proposed earlier for realizing
a high bandwidth, long delay data buffering system

by modulating the sign of the interaction spatially around each lattice
hexagon. A superfluid to Mott insulating quantum phase transition can be
induced by varying the relative strength of the classical interaction and
quantum hopping. In the cases where the interaction has a regular spatial
modulation, hopping promotes a phase transition to a symmetry-broken
valence-bond solid state. When the interaction is forced to have no regular
pattern, the Mott insulating phase is found to be featureless and gapped,
making it an interesting candidate state for a quantum spin liquid arising in a
Hamiltonian with only nearest-neighbor interactions.

boundary Y. The partition function of the C-field requires summing over
harmonic forms. When Y is closed Hodge theory gives a unique harmonic form in
each de Rham cohomology class, while in the presence of a boundary the
Hodge-Morrey-Friedrichs decomposition should be used. This leads us to study
the boundary conditions for the C-field. The dynamics and the presence of the
dual to the C-field gives rise to a mixing of boundary conditions with one
being Dirichlet and the other being Neumann. We describe the mixing between the
corresponding absolute and relative cohomology classes via Poincar\'e duality
angles, which we also illustrate for the M5-brane as a tubular neighborhood.
Several global aspects are then considered. We provide a systematic study of
the extension of the E8 bundle and characterize obstructions. Considering Y as
a fiber bundle, we describe how the phase looks like on the base, hence
providing dimensional reduction in the boundary case via the adiabatic limit of
the eta invariant. The general use of the index theorem leads to a new effect
given by a gravitational Chern-Simons term CS on Y whose restriction to the
boundary would be a generalized WZW model. This suggests that holographic
models of M-theory can be viewed as a sector within this index-theoretic
approach.

formation of different color superfluid domains in systems where the total

symmetric realization of a more general tendency to phase-separation in
three-component Fermi mixtures. The three-body constraint strongly disfavors
the trionic phase, stabilizing a (fully magnetized) color superfluid also at
strong coupling. With increasing temperature we observe a transition to a

EasyDD has achieved its objectives and made significant contributions to
scientific research. It can also be used as a model for more mature attempts in

of academic and research institutions to process high-energy diffraction data.
These include data collected by different techniques such as Energy Dispersive

its associated probability distribution are both controlled by the ratio
$k=M/L^{\zeta_{\mathrm{dep}}}$, where $\zeta_{\mathrm{dep}}$ is the

the string and $M$ the transverse periodicity of the random medium. The
rescaled average square width $\bar{w^2}/L^{2\zeta_{\mathrm{dep}}}$ displays a
non-trivial single minimum for a finite value of $k$. We show that the initial
decrease for small $k$ reflects the crossover at $k \sim 1$ from the
random-periodic to the random-manifold roughness. The increase for very large
$k$ implies that the increasingly rare critical configurations, accompanying
the crossover to Gumbel critical-force statistics, display anomalous roughness
properties: a transverse-periodicity scaling in spite that $\bar{w^2} \ll M$,
and subleading corrections to the standard random-manifold longitudinal-size
scaling. Our results are relevant to understanding the dimensional crossover

  First, the thesis will focus on the study of the merging of two intervals of

this special limit gives universal equations from the Painlev\'e II hierarchy
of integrable systems theory. Then, following the approach of (bi) orthogonal
polynomials introduced by Mehta to compute partition functions, we will find
Riemann-Hilbert and isomonodromic problems connected to matrix models, making
the link with the theory of Jimbo, Miwa and Ueno. In particular, we will
describe how the hermitian two-matrix models provide a degenerate case of
Jimbo-Miwa-Ueno's theory that we will generalize in this context. Furthermore,
the loop equations method, with its central notions of spectral curve and
topological expansion, will lead to the symplectic invariants of algebraic
geometry recently proposed by Eynard and Orantin. This last point will be
generalized to the case of non-hermitian matrix models (arbitrary $\beta$)
paving the way to ""quantum algebraic geometry"" and to the generalization of
symplectic invariants to ""quantum curves"". Finally, this set up will be applied
to combinatorics in the context of topological string theory, with the explicit

with an improved semi-analytic method that takes into account
position-dependent energy losses in the Milky Way. Using such propagation

antiprotons and antideuterons at the location of the Earth. We then present the

Assuming a Hubble redshift, SDSS data can be interpreted as luminosity
evolution following the Big Bang. In contrast, given a de Sitter redshift, the
intrinsic brightness of objects at all redshifts is roughly the same. In a de
Sitter universe, 95 per cent of SDSS galaxies and quasars fall into a magnitude
range of only 2.8, and 99.7 per cent are within 5.4 mag. The comparable Hubble
luminosity ranges are much larger: 95 per cent within 6.9, and 99.7 per cent

nuclear quadrupole hyperfine interactions can be used as a diagnostic marker of
progress along the isomerization path in both the HC14N/H14NC and DC15N/D15NC

that the hyperfine interaction is extremely sensitive to the chemical bonding
of the quadrupolar 14N nucleus and can therefore be used to determine in which
potential well the vibrational wavefunction is localized. A natural bonding
orbital analysis along the isomerization path further demonstrates that
hyperfine interactions arise from the asphericity of the electron density at
the quadrupolar nucleus. Using the CCSD(T) potential surface, the quadrupole
coupling constants of highly-excited vibrational states are computed from a
one-dimensional internal coordinate path Hamiltonian. The excellent agreement
between ab initio calculations and recent measurements demonstrates that
nuclear quadrupole hyperfine structure can be used as a diagnostic tool for

e.g., the sky position of a localized source, can improve when using a network
of baselines, as compared to any of the single participating baselines. The
search statistic itself is derived from the likelihood ratio of the cross
correlation of the data across all possible baselines in a detector network and
is optimal in Gaussian noise. Specifically, it is the likelihood ratio
maximized over the strength of the SGWB, and is called the maximized-likelihood
ratio (MLR). One of the main advantages of using the MLR over past search
strategies for inferring the presence or absence of a signal is that the former
does not require the deconvolution of the cross correlation statistic.
Therefore, it does not suffer from errors inherent to the deconvolution
procedure and is especially useful for detecting weak sources. In the limit of
a single baseline, it reduces to the detection statistic studied by Ballmer

standing wave braneworld generated by gravity coupled to a phantom-like scalar
field. We explicitly solve the corresponding junction conditions, a fact that
enables us to give a physical interpretation to the anisotropic energy-momentum
tensor components on the brane. So matter on the brane represents an
oscillating fluid which emits anisotropic waves into the bulk. We also analyze
the Sturm-Liouville problem associated to the correct localization condition of
the transverse to the brane metric and scalar fields. It is shown that this
condition restricts the physically meaningful space of solutions for the
localization of the fluctuations of the model.

for characterizing the unique and highly complex structures often encountered
in the emerging field of nano and microscale self-assembly, or other
disciplines involving complex structures such as computational biology.
Computer science algorithms known as ""shape matching"" methods pose a unique
solution to this problem by providing robust metrics for quantifying the
similarity between pairs of arbitrarily complex structures. This pairwise
matching operation, either implicitly or explicitly, lies at the heart of most
standard structural characterization schemes for particle systems. By
substituting more robust ""shape descriptors"" into these schemes we extend their
applicability to structures formed from more complex building blocks. Here, we
describe several structural characterization schemes and shape descriptors that
can be used to obtain various types of structural information about particle
systems. We demonstrate the application of shape matching algorithms to a
variety of example problems, for topics including local and global structure
identification and classification, automated phase diagram mapping, and the
construction of spatial and temporal correlation functions. The methods are
applicable to a wide range of systems, both simulated and experimental,
provided particle positions are known or can be accurately imaged.

continuum emission at 610 MHz and 325 MHz is detected from all the observed

galaxies are members of groups and two galaxies (Mrk 1069 and I Zw 97) are

encompass the entire optical galaxy whereas the radio emission from Mrk 1039,
Mrk 1069, I Zw 97 is confined to massive HII regions. This, we suggest,
indicates that the star formation in the latter group of galaxies has recently
been triggered and that the environment in which the galaxy is evolving plays a
role. Star formation rates (SFR) calculated from 610 MHz emission is in the
range 0.01-0.1 M_sun/yr; this is similar to the SFR obtained for individual
star forming regions in BCDs. The integrated radio spectra of four galaxies are
modelled over the frequency range where data is available. We find that two of
the galaxies Mrk 1069 and Mrk 1039, show a turnover at low frequencies which is
well fitted by free-free absorption whereas the other two galaxies, Mrk 104 and
Mrk 108, show a power law at the lowest GMRT frequencies. The flatter spectrum,
localized star formation and radio continuum in isolated galaxies lend support
to stochastic self-propagating star formation (SSPSF). The HI observations of

large as ~1.1-6 times the optical size. All the observed BCDs (except Mrk 104)

black brane. We show that at the intersection surface of the test brane and the
bulk black string/brane the induced metric has an event horizon, so that the
test brane contains a black hole. We call it a brane hole. When the test brane
moves with a constant velocity V with respect to the bulk black object it also
has a brane hole, but its gravitational radius r_e is greater than the size of
the bulk black string/brane r_0 by the factor (1-V^2)^{-1}. We show that bulk
`photon' emitted in the region between r_0 and r_e can meet the test brane
again at a point outside r_e. From the point of view of observers on the test
brane the events of emission and capture of the bulk `photon' are connected by
a spacelike curve in the induced geometry. This shows an example in which extra
dimensions can be used to extract information from the interior of a lower
dimensional black object. Instead of the bulk black string/brane, one can also
consider a bulk geometry without horizon. We show that nevertheless the induced
geometry on the moving test brane can include a brane hole. In such a case the
extra dimensions can be used to extract information from the complete region of
the brane hole interior. We discuss thermodynamic properties of brane holes and
interesting questions which arise when such an extra dimensional channel for

the performance degradation due to mistiming is derived. Monte Carlo

the performance loss has little relationship with the target achievable

multipath diversity order, which reflects design trade-offs among the system
timing requirement, the bandwidth and the implementation complexity. In
addition, the performance degradations of Rake receivers with different
multipath component selection schemes and combining techniques are compared.
Among these receivers, the widely used maximal ratio combining (MRC)
selective-Rake (S-Rake) suffers the largest performance loss in the presence of

include the effects of viscosity; the hydrodynamics component preserves angular
momentum strictly with Lagrangian and remap method in absence of viscosity,
while the viscosity component updates viscous angular momentum transfer through
the implicit method. We performed two tests to demonstrate the suitability of
the code for accretion study. First, we simulated the inviscid, low angular
momentum, transonic accretion flow with shocks around a black hole, and then
the subsonic, self-similar ADAF solution around a Newtonian object. Both
simulations fitted the corresponding analytical curves extremely well. We then
simulated a rotating, viscous, transonic fluid with shocks. We showed that for
low viscosity parameter, stable shocks at larger distance are possible. For
higher viscosity parameter, more efficient angular momentum transfer in the
post-shock disk makes the shock structure oscillatory. Moreover, as the shock
drifts to larger distances, a secondary inner shock develops. We showed that
the inner shock is the direct consequence of expansion of the outer shock, as
well as creation of regions with $\partial l / \partial r < 0$ due to more
efficient angular momentum transfer near the inner sonic point. We showed that
all disk parameters, including emissivity, oscillate with the same period as

legitimate nodes and the eavesdroppers are distributed according to independent
two-dimensional Poisson point processes. The transmission capacity framework is
used to characterize the area spectral efficiency of secure transmissions with
constraints on both the quality of service (QoS) and the level of security.
This framework illustrates the dependence of the network throughput on key
system parameters, such as the densities of legitimate nodes and eavesdroppers,
as well as the QoS and security constraints. One important finding is that the
throughput cost of achieving a moderate level of security is quite low, while
throughput must be significantly sacrificed to realize a highly secure network.

significant improvement on the throughput of networks with high security
requirements.

using an anomalously dispersive intra-cavity medium to adjust a cavity

WLC can be used to realize a distortion-free delay system for a data pulse. The
system consists of two WLCs placed in series. Once the pulse has passed through
them, the fast-light media in both WLCs are deactivated, so that each of these
now acts as a very high reflectivity mirror. The data pulse bounces around
between these mirrors, undergoing negligible attenuation per pass. The trapped
pulse can be released by activating the fast-light medium in either WLC.
Numerical simulations show that such a system can far exceed the
delay-bandwidth constraint encountered in a typical data buffer employing slow

specific to close binary systems. The starting point is the common envelope
phase in the evolution of a binary consisting of a red super giant and a
neutron star. As the neutron star spirals towards the center of its companion
it spins up via disk accretion. Depending on the specific angular momentum of
gas captured by the neutron star via the Bondi-Hoyle mechanism, it may reach
millisecond periods either when it is still inside the common envelope or after
it has merged with the companion core. The high accretion rate may result in
strong differential rotation of the neutron star and generation of the
magnetar-strength magnetic field. The magnetar wind can blow away the common
envelope if its magnetic field is as strong as $10^{15}\,$G, and can destroy
the entire companion if it is as strong as $10^{16}\,$G. The total explosion
energy can be comparable to the rotational energy of a millisecond pulsar and
reach $10^{52}\,$erg. However, only a small amount of $^{56}$Ni is expected to
be produced this way. The result is an unusual type-II supernova with very high
luminosity during the plateau phase, followed by a sharp drop in brightness and
a steep light-curve tail. The remnant is either a solitary magnetar or a close
binary involving a Wolf-Rayet star and a magnetar. When this Wolf-Rayet star
explodes this will be a third supernovae explosion in the same binary.

Herschel Space Observatory designed to probe the physical and chemical
structure of young stellar objects using water and related molecules and to
follow the water abundance from collapsing clouds to planet-forming disks.
About 80 sources are targeted covering a wide range of luminosities and
evolutionary stages, from cold pre-stellar cores to warm protostellar envelopes
and outflows to disks around young stars. Both the HIFI and PACS instruments
are used to observe a variety of lines of H2O, H218O and chemically related
species. An overview of the scientific motivation and observational strategy of
the program is given together with the modeling approach and analysis tools
that have been developed. Initial science results are presented. These include
a lack of water in cold gas at abundances that are lower than most predictions,
strong water emission from shocks in protostellar environments, the importance
of UV radiation in heating the gas along outflow walls across the full range of
luminosities, and surprisingly widespread detection of the chemically related
hydrides OH+ and H2O+ in outflows and foreground gas. Quantitative estimates of
the energy budget indicate that H2O is generally not the dominant coolant in
the warm dense gas associated with protostars. Very deep limits on the cold
gaseous water reservoir in the outer regions of protoplanetary disks are
obtained which have profound implications for our understanding of grain growth
and mixing in disks.

discover whether novel approaches can predict the outcomes of future games,
more accurately than the well-known Elo rating system. The winning rating
system, called Elo++ in the rest of the article, builds upon the Elo rating
system. Like Elo, Elo++ uses a single rating per player and predicts the
outcome of a game, by using a logistic curve over the difference in ratings of
the players. The major component of Elo++ is a regularization technique that
avoids overfitting these ratings. The dataset of chess games and outcomes is
relatively small and one has to be careful not to draw ""too many conclusions""
out of the limited data. Many approaches tested in the competition showed signs
of such an overfitting. The leader-board was dominated by attempts that did a
very good job on a small test dataset, but couldn't generalize well on the
private hold-out dataset. The Elo++ regularization takes into account the
number of games per player, the recency of these games and the ratings of the
opponents. Finally, Elo++ employs a stochastic gradient descent scheme for
training the ratings, and uses only two global parameters (white's advantage
and regularization constant) that are optimized using cross-validation.

double decompositions into indecomposable polynomials. The analogues of Ritt
theory for rational functions were constructed just for several particular
classes of the said functions, say for Laurent polynomials (F.Pakovich). In
this note we describe a certain class of double decompositions for rational
functions. Essentially, described below rational functions were discovered by
E.I.Zolotarev in 1877 as a solution of certain optimization problem. However,
the double decomposition property for them was hidden until recently because of
somewhat awkward representation. We give a (possibly new) symmetric
representation of Zolotarev fractions resembling the parametric representation
for Chebyshev polynomials, which are a special limit case of Zolotarev

motivation to develop a means to extend the frequency transfer to accurate time
transfer. We aim at the synchronization of clocks located at different places
of the PTB campus with an over-all uncertainty of less than 100 ps. Such an
installation can be used as a part of the infrastructure connecting local time
scales with the ground station setup during forthcoming ACES experiments and
the local two-way satellite time and frequency transfer (TWSTFT) installations.
This paper reports on the progress on time transfer through optical fibers
(TTTOF) similar to the well known and long established TWSTFT scheme: A 10 MHz
signal is transferred through an optical fiber connection to a remote site for
realization of a time scale using a 10 MHz to 1PPS divider. For time transfer
the 1PPS output is initially synchronized and then monitored by TWSTFT
equipment connected by a second optical fiber to observe instabilities and
uncertainties. Depending on further needs in future the transferred signal can
be monitored only (for software correction) or controlled in real time by
adding adequate phase shifters. We discuss procedures for a proper calibration
of such TTTOF links and show results of experiments using fiber lengths up to
two kilometers which prove that the proposed method is well suitable for the
envisaged purpose.

motivated by the fact that there are networks for which there are no linear

apply detailed prescriptions on the evolution of diffuse hot gases in
satellites and on stellar mass loss, both of which are critical to model cold
gas evolution. We replace the conventional shock-heating motivated instant
stripping with a realistic gradual prescription based on ram pressure and tidal
stripping. We also carefully consider stellar mass loss in our model. When both
mechanisms are included, the fraction of passive late types matches the data
much more closely. The satellite over-quenching problem is still present in
small galaxies in massive haloes, however. In terms of the detectable residual
star formation rates, gradual diffuse gas stripping appears to be much more
important than stellar mass loss in our model. The implications of these
results and other possibilities, such as redshift-dependent merging geometry
and tidal disruption, are also discussed.

reported for radio, X-ray and TeV gamma-ray bands. Several comparisons between
models and observations have been discussed in the literature, showing that the
broad-band spectrum from the whole remnant as well as a sharpest radial profile
of the X-ray brightness can be both fitted by adopting a model of SN1006 which
strongly depends on the non-linear effects of the accelerated cosmic rays;
these models predict post-shock magnetic field (MF) strengths of the order of
150 micro G. Here we present a new way to compare models and observations, in
order to put constraints on the physical parameters and mechanisms governing
the remnant. In particular, we show that a simple model based on the classic
MHD and cosmic rays acceleration theories allows us to investigate the
spatially distributed characteristics of SN1006 and to put observational
constraints on the kinetics and MF. Our method includes modelling and
comparison of the azimuthal and radial profiles of the surface brightness in
radio, hard X-rays and TeV gamma-rays as well as the azimuthal variations of
the electron maximum energy. In addition, this simple model also provides good
fits to the radio-to-gamma-ray spectrum of SN1006. We find that our best-fit
model predicts an effective MF strength inside SN1006 of 32 micro G, in good
agreement with the `leptonic' model suggested by the HESS Collaboration (2010).
Finally, some difficulties in both the `classic' and the non-linear models are
discussed. A number of evidences about non-uniformity of MF around SN1006 are
noted.

orbital inclination effect. In addition, we have also detected many of their
optical orbital periodicities, visible as a series of precisely regular
outbursts. Furthermore, the amplitude of these periodic outbursts can vary
through the long-term superorbital cycle, and we discuss mechanisms which can
produce this effect, as well as examining an apparent correlation between these

discrete stages: active and inactive. The evolution of the network combines the
addition of new active nodes randomly connected to existing active ones and the
deactivation of old active nodes with possibility inversely proportional to
their fitnesses. We obtain a structured exponential network when the fitness

(ADK) involves the binding of one ATP molecule to the LID domain and one AMP
molecule to the NMP domain. The latter is followed by a phosphate transfer, and
then the release of two ADP molecules. We have computed a novel two dimensional
configurational free energy surface (2DCFES), with one reaction coordinate each
for the LID and the NMP domain motions, with explicit interactions with water.
Our computed 2DCFES clearly reveals the existence of a stable
half-open-half-closed (HOHC) intermediate state of the enzyme. Cycling of the
enzyme through the HOHC state reduces the conformational free energy barrier
for the reaction by about 20 kJ/mol. We find that the stability of the
half-open-half-closed state (missed in all earlier studies with implicit
solvent model) is largely because of the increase of specific interactions of
the polar amino acid side chains with water, particularly with the arginine and
the histidine residues. Free energy surface of the LID domain is rather rugged,
which can conveniently slow down LID's conformational motion, thus facilitating
a new substrate capture after the product release in the catalytic cycle.

model, based on (3+1)d hydrodynamics and a microscopic Boltzmann transport
approach. The initial conditions are generated by a non-equilibrium hadronic
transport approach and the size of their fluctuations can be adjusted by
defining a Gaussian smoothing parameter $\sigma$. The dependence of the

  $\sigma$ and $t_{start}$ is explored by means of a Gaussian emulator.
  To generate particle yields and elliptic flow that are compatible with

equation of state is studied and the results of our event-by-event calculations

that even though the initial state parameters can be constrained by yields and

decomposition, depending on the initial composition and extent of the quench.
Here we develop an energy landscape view of phase separation and non-ideality
in binary mixtures by exploring their potential energy landscape (PEL) as
functions of temperature and composition, by employing a molecular model that
promotes structure breaking abilities of the solute-solvent parent binary
liquid at low temperatures. PEL that provides the inherent structure (IS) of a
system is obtained by removing the kinetic energy (including that of
intermolecular vibrations). Broad Distribution of inherent structure energy
demonstrates the larger role of entropy in stabilizing the parent liquid of the
structure breaking type of binary mixtures. At high temperature, although the
parent structure is homogenous, the corresponding inherent structure is found
to be always phase separated, with a density pattern that exhibits marked
correlation with the energy of inherent structure. Over broad range of
intermediate inherent structure energy, bicontinuous phase separation prevails
with interpenetrating stripes as signatures of spinodal decomposition. At low
inherent structure energy, the structure is largely phase separated with one
interface where as at high inherent structure energy, we find nucleation type
growth. Interestingly, at low temperature, the average inherent structure
energy (<EIS>) exhibits a drop with temperature which signals onset of
crystallization in one of the phases while the other remains in the liquid
state. The non-ideal composition dependence of viscosity is anti-correlated
with average inherent structure energy.

Historically, tracer particles of constant mass are employed. However,
intermediate mass elements, such as e.g. Ne, Mg, Al, or Si, are typically
synthesized in the outer layers of SNe Ia, where due to the lower initial
density a constant mass tracer distribution results in poor resolution of the
spatial morphology of the abundance distribution. We show how to alleviate this

produced in regions where a constant tracer mass implementation results in poor

Auger and internal conversion electrons constitute an additional heat source.
At late times, these electrons can contribute significantly to supernova light
curves for reasonable nucleosynthetic yields. In particular, the internal
conversion electrons emitted in the decay of 57Co are an important heating
channel for supernovae that have become largely transparent to gamma-rays. We
show that when the heating by these electrons is accounted for, the slowing
down of the light curves of SN 1998bw and SN 2003hv is naturally obtained for
typical nucleosynthetic yields. Additionally, we show that for SN 1987A the

nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) by a tunnel junction detector. Using the
Keldysh technique, we are able to investigate the dynamics of the combined
system for an arbitrary ratio of $eV/\hbar \Omega$, where V is the applied bias
of the tunnel junction and $\Omega$ the eigenfrequency of the oscillator. In
this sense, we go beyond the Markov approximation of previous works where these
parameters were restricted to the regime $eV/\hbar \Omega\gg 1$. Furthermore,
we also go beyond the Born approximation because we calculate the finite
frequency current noise of the tunnel junction up to fourth order in the
tunneling amplitudes. Interestingly, we discover different ways to probe both
position and momentum properties of NEMS. On the one hand, for a non-stationary
oscillator, we find a complex finite frequency noise of the tunnel junction. By
analyzing the real and the imaginary part of this noise separately, we conclude
that a simple tunnel junction detector can probe both position- and
momentum-based observables of the non-stationary oscillator. On the other hand,
for a stationary oscillator, a more complicated setup based on an
Aharonov-Bohm-loop tunnel junction detector is needed. It still allows us to
extract position and momentum information of the oscillator. For this type of
detector, we analyze for the first time what happens if the energy scales $eV$,
$\hbar \Omega$, and $k_B T$ take arbitrary values with respect to each other
where T is the temperature of an external heat bath. Under these circumstances,
we show that it is possible to uniquely identify the quantum state of the
oscillator by a finite frequency noise measurement.

that future measurements of the soft X-ray polarisation vector unambiguously
determine the orientation of the ionisation cones. Furthermore, X-ray
polarimetry across a broad photon energy range may independently verify the
misalignment between the ionisation cones and the axis of the torus. To model
the expected polarisation percentage and position angle, we apply the radiative
transfer code STOKES. Reprocessing of the primary X-ray radiation takes place
in the accretion disc, the surrounding equatorial torus and the inclined,
ionised outflows. We also examine additional equatorial scattering occurring in
between the accretion disc and the inner surfaces of the torus. Radiative
coupling between the different reprocessing components is computed coherently.
The resulting polarisation properties depend on the optical depth of the
reprocessing regions and on the viewing angle of the observer. We show that
even under unfavourable conditions the misalignment of the outflows with
respect to the torus axis can be determined from a rotation of the polarisation
position angle between softer and harder X-rays. We argue that the misalignment

abundantly studied in the literature, preheating in small field inflation
models, where the curvature of the inflaton potential is negative during
inflation, remains less explored. In these models, a tachyonic instability at
the end of inflation leads to a succession of exponentially large increases and
\emph{decreases} of the inflaton fluctuations as the inflaton condensate
oscillates around the minimum of its potential. The net effect is a competition
between low-momentum modes which grow and decrease significantly, and modes
with higher momenta which grow less but also decrease less. We develop an
analytical description of this process, which is analogous to the quantum
mechanical problem of tunneling through a volcano-shaped potential. Depending
on the parameters, preheating may be so efficient that it completes in less
than one oscillation of the inflaton condensate. Preheating after small field
inflation may also be followed by a long matter-dominated stage before the
universe thermalizes, depending on the energy scale of inflation and the
details of the inflaton interactions. Finally, another feature of these models
is that the spectrum of the inflaton fluctuations at the end of preheating may
be peaked around the Hubble scale. In fact, because preheating starts when the
second slow-roll parameter $|\eta|$ becomes of order unity while the first
slow-roll parameter $\epsilon$ is still much smaller than one, the universe is
still inflating during preheating and the modes amplified by the initial
tachyonic instability leave the Hubble radius. This may lead to an abundant
production of primordial black holes and gravitational waves with frequencies
today which are naturally small enough to fall into the range accessible by
high-sensitivity interferometric experiments.

significant features of Berry's phases for S>1, generated by spin-Hamiltonians
endowed with two couplings, a magnetic dipole and an electric quadrupole one
with external B and E fields, as theoretically studied in our previous work.
The fields are assumed orthogonal, this mild restriction leading to geometric
and algebraic simplifications. Alkali atoms appear as good candidates for
interferometric measurements but there are challenges to be overcome. The only
practical way to generate a suitable E-field is to use the ac Stark effect
which induces an instability of the dressed atom. Besides atom loss, this might
invalidate Berry's phase derivation but this latter problem can be solved by an
appropriate detuning. The former puts an upper limit to the cycle duration,
which is bounded below by the adiabatic condition. By relying upon our previous
analysis of the non-adiabatic corrections, we have been able to reach a
compromise for the $^{87}$Rb hf level F=2, m=0 state, which is our candidate
for an interferometric measurement of the exotic Berry's phase generated by a
rotation of the E-field around the fixed B-field. By a numerical simulation we
have shown that the non-adiabatic corrections can be kept below the 0.1% level.
As an alternative candidate, we discuss the chromium ground state J=S=3, where
the instability problem is easily solved. We make a proposal to extend the
measurement of Aharonov-Anandan's phase beyond S=1/2 to the $^{87}$Rb hf level
F=m=1, by constructing, with the help of light-shifts, a Hamiltonian able to
perform a parallel transport along a closed circuit upon the density matrix
space, without any adiabatic constraint. In Appendix A, Berry's phase
difference for S=3/2 and 1/2, m=1/2 states is used to perform an entanglement
of 3 Qbits.

with the neighbors' decision variables; and 2) accounts on-the-fly for its new
observation. We show that distributed detection exhibits a ""phase change""
behavior. When the rate of network information flow (the speed of averaging) is
above a threshold, then distributed detection is asymptotically equivalent to
the optimal centralized detection, i.e., the exponential decay rate of the
error probability for distributed detection equals the Chernoff information.
When the rate of information flow is below a threshold, distributed detection
achieves only a fraction of the Chernoff information rate; we quantify this
achievable rate as a function of the network rate of information flow.
Simulation examples demonstrate our theoretical findings on the behavior of
distributed detection over random networks.

fraction of events. We describe a new technique, which provides an accurate
mass reconstruction of the original resonance and does not suffer from the
limitations of the collinear approximation. The major improvement comes from
replacing assumptions of the collinear approximation by a requirement that
mutual orientations of the neutrinos and other decay products are consistent
with the mass and decay kinematics of a $\tau$ lepton. This is achieved by
minimizing a likelihood function defined in the kinematically allowed phase
space region. In this paper we describe the technique and illustrate its
performance using $Z/\gamma^{*}\to\tau\tau$ and $H\to\tau\tau$ events simulated
with the realistic detector resolution. The method is also tested on a clean
sample of data $Z/\gamma^{*}\to\tau\tau$ events collected by the CDF experiment
at the Tevatron. We expect that this new technique will allow for a major
improvement in searches for the Higgs boson at both the LHC and the Tevatron.

the brilliant H alpha line, have been interpreted as emission from a
circumbinary disk. In this interpretation the orbital speed of the glowing
material is in excess of 200 km/s and the mass of the binary system in excess
of 40 solar masses. A very simple model of excitation of disk material is in
remarkable agreement with the observations, yet it seems that the very
existence of a circumbinary disk is regarded as controversial.
  Published spectra, taken almost nightly over two orbital periods of the
binary system, show H alpha and He I lines; these were analysed as
superpositions of Gaussian components. A model in which the excitation of any
given patch of putative circumbinary material is proportional to the inverse
square of its instantaneous distance from the compact object was constructed
and compared with observations.
  The new model provides an excellent description of the observations. The
variation of the H alpha and He I spectra with orbital phase are described
quantitatively provided the radius of the emitting ring is not much greater
than the radius of the closest stable circumbinary orbit.
  The new analysis has greatly strengthened the case for a circumbinary disk
orbiting the SS 433 system with a speed of over 200 km/s and presents supposed
alternative explanations with major difficulties. If the circumbinary disk
scenario is essentially correct, the mass of the binary system must exceed 40
solar masses and the compact object must be a rather massive black hole. The
case is so strong that this possibility should be taken seriously.

there is an algorithm which given an instance (G,k) of Vertex Cover outputs an
equivalent instance (G',k') in polynomial time with the guarantee that G' has
at most 2k' vertices (and thus O((k')^2) edges) with k' <= k. Using the
terminology of parameterized complexity we say that k-Vertex Cover has a kernel
with 2k vertices. There is complexity-theoretic evidence that both 2k vertices
and Theta(k^2) edges are optimal for the kernel size. In this paper we consider
the Vertex Cover problem with a different parameter, the size fvs(G) of a
minimum feedback vertex set for G. This refined parameter is structurally
smaller than the parameter k associated to the vertex covering number vc(G)
since fvs(G) <= vc(G) and the difference can be arbitrarily large. We give a
kernel for Vertex Cover with a number of vertices that is cubic in fvs(G): an
instance (G,X,k) of Vertex Cover, where X is a feedback vertex set for G, can
be transformed in polynomial time into an equivalent instance (G',X',k') such
that |V(G')| <= 2k and |V(G')| <= O(|X'|^3). A similar result holds when the
feedback vertex set X is not given along with the input. In sharp contrast we
show that the Weighted Vertex Cover problem does not have a polynomial kernel

information loss paradox"". However, this paradox assumes a new form and can
possibly be avoided in a consistent causal treatment that may be able to avoid
horizons and singularities. - A ""master arrow"", which combines all arrows of
time, does not have to be identified with a direction of the formal time
parameter that serves to formulate the dynamics as a succession of global
states (a trajectory in configuration or Hilbert space). It may even change
direction with respect to a fundamental physical clock such as the cosmic
expansion parameter if this was formally extended either into a future
contraction era or to negative ""pre-big-bang"" values.

single site in an abelian sandpile model with a periodic initial configuration,
and relaxing. The patterns show proportionate growth. We study the robustness
of these patterns against different types of noise, \textit{viz.}, randomness
in the point of addition, disorder in the initial periodic configuration, and
disorder in the connectivity of the underlying lattice. We find that the
patterns show a varying degree of robustness to addition of a small amount of
noise in each case. However, introducing stochasticity in the toppling rules
seems to destroy the asymptotic patterns completely, even for a weak noise. We
also discuss a variational formulation of the pattern selection problem in
growing abelian sandpiles.

(GIFC) with two pairs of users, which are distinguished as primary users and
secondary users, respectively. The primary users employ a pair of encoder and
decoder that were originally designed to satisfy a given error performance
requirement under the assumption that no interference exists from other users.
In the scenario when the secondary users attempt to access the same medium, we
are interested in the maximum transmission rate (defined as {\em accessible
capacity}) at which secondary users can communicate reliably without affecting
the error performance requirement by the primary users under the constraint
that the primary encoder (not the decoder) is kept unchanged. By modeling the
primary encoder as a generalized trellis code (GTC), we are then able to treat
the secondary link and the cross link from the secondary transmitter to the
primary receiver as finite state channels (FSCs). Based on this, upper and
lower bounds on the accessible capacity are derived. The impact of the error
performance requirement by the primary users on the accessible capacity is
analyzed by using the concept of interference margin. In the case of
non-trivial interference margin, the secondary message is split into common and
private parts and then encoded by superposition coding, which delivers a lower
bound on the accessible capacity. For some special cases, these bounds can be
computed numerically by using the BCJR algorithm. Numerical results are also
provided to gain insight into the impacts of the GTC and the error performance
requirement on the accessible capacity.

identities for the Bernstein polynomials using a novel generating function. We
derive various functional equations and differential equations using this
generating function. Using these equations, we give new proofs both for a
recursive definition of the Bernstein basis functions and for derivatives of
the nth degree Bernstein polynomials. We also find some new identities and
properties for the Bernstein basis functions. Furthermore, we discuss analytic
representations for the generalized Bernstein polynomials through the binomial
or Newton distribution and Poisson distribution with mean and variance. Using
this novel generating function, we also derive an identity which represents a
pointwise orthogonality relation for the Bernstein basis functions. Finally, by
using the mean and the variance, we generalize Szasz-Mirakjan type basis
functions.
