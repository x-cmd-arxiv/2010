three research contributions. (i) We report a comprehensive characterization of
IP traffic on smartphones using traces collected from 27 iPhone 3GS users for
three months. (ii) Driven by the findings from the characterization, we devise
two novel system mechanisms for mobile devices to sup-port seamless flow
migration without network support, and extensively evaluate their effectiveness
using our field collected traces of real-life usage. Wait-n-Migrate leverages
the fact that most flows are short lived. It establishes new flows on newly
available networks but allows pre-existing flows on the old network to
terminate naturally, effectively decreasing, or even eliminating, connectivity
gaps during network switches. Resumption Agent takes advantage of the
functionality integrated into many modern protocols to securely resume flows
without application intervention. When combined, Wait-n-Migrate and Resumption
Agent provide an unprecedented opportunity to immediately deploy performance
and efficiency-enhancing policies that leverage multiple networks to improve
the performance, efficiency, and connectivity of mobile devices. (iii) Finally,
we report an iPhone 3GS based implementation of these two system mechanisms and
show that their overhead is negligible. Furthermore, we employ an example
network switching policy, called AutoSwitch, to demonstrate their performance.
AutoSwitch improves the Wi-Fi user experience by intelligently migrating TCP
flows between Wi-Fi and cellular networks. Through traces and field
measurements, we show that AutoSwitch reduces the number of user disruptions by

supermassive black hole masses (MBH) and the structural parameters of the host
spheroids in local galaxies. The work is based on two-dimensional bulge-disk
decompositions of Spitzer/IRAC 3.6 um images of 57 galaxies with MBH estimates.
Our estimates of effective radii (Re) and surface brightnesses, combined with
velocity dispersions (sigma) from the literature, define a FP relation
consistent with previous determinations but doubling the observed range in Re.
None of our galaxies is an outlier of the FP, demonstrating the accuracy of our
bulge-disk decomposition which also allows us to independently identify
pseudobulges in our sample. We calibrate M/L at 3.6 um by using the tight
Mdyn-Lbul relation (~0.1 dex of rms) and find that no color corrections are
required to estimate the stellar mass. The 3.6 um luminosity is thus the best
tracer of Mstar yet studied. We then explore the connection between MBH and
bulge structural parameters (luminosity, mass, effective radius). We find tight
correlations of MBH with both 3.6 um bulge luminosity and dynamical mass
(MBH/Mdyn~1/1000), with rms of ~0.35 dex, similar to the MBH-sigma relation.
Our results are consistent with previous determinations at shorter wavelengths.
By using our calibrated M/L, we rescale MBH-Lbul to obtain the MBH-Mstar
relation, which can be used as the local reference for high-z studies which
probe the cosmic evolution of MBH-galaxy relations and where the stellar mass
is inferred directly from luminosity measurements. The analysis of pseudobulges
shows that 4 out of 9 lie on the scaling relations within the observed scatter,
while those with small MBH are significantly displaced. We explore the
different origins for such behavior, while considering the possibility of
nuclear morphological components not reproduced by our two-dimensional
decomposition.

of extrasolar planetary systems. Bodies can be trapped in resonance when their
orbital semi-major axes change, for instance when they migrate through a
protoplanetary disc. We use a Hamiltonian model to thoroughly investigate the
capture behaviour for first and second order resonances. Using this method, all
resonances of the same order can be described by one equation, with
applications to specific resonances by appropriate scaling. We focus on the
limit where one body is a massless test particle and the other a massive
planet. We quantify how the the probability of capture into a resonance depends
on the relative migration rate of the planet and particle, and the particle's
eccentricity. Resonant capture fails for high migration rates, and has
decreasing probability for higher eccentricities. More massive planets can
capture particles at higher eccentricities and migration rates. We also
calculate libration amplitudes and the offset of the libration centres for
captured particles, and the change in eccentricity if capture does not occur.
Libration amplitudes are higher for larger initial eccentricity. The model
allows for a complete description of a particle's behaviour as it successively
encounters several resonances. We discuss implications for several scenarios:
(i) Planet migration through gas discs trapping other planets or planetesimals
in resonances. (ii) Planet migration through a debris disc. (iii) Dust
migration through PR drag. The Hamiltonian model will allow quick
interpretation of the resonant properties of extrasolar planets and Kuiper Belt
Objects, and will allow synthetic images of debris disc structures to be
quickly generated, which will be useful for predicting and interpreting disc
images made with ALMA, Darwin/TPF or similar missions. [Abridged]

interacting with massless scalar and vector fields in curved space-time. It is
based on the analysis of field Green's functions with both points lying on the
particle world-line and does not require integration of the field stresses
outside the world line as was used in the DeWitt-Brehme approach, thus leading
to a substantial simplification of the problem. We start with space-time of an
arbitrary dimension and show that the Hadamard expansion of the massless scalar
and vector Green's functions contain only integer inverse powers of the Synge
world function in even dimensions and only half-integer in the odd dimensions.
The even-dimensional case then is treated in detail. We analyze divergencies,
calculate higher-derivative counterterms, and find a recurrent formula for the
local parts of the reaction force in neighboring dimensions. Higher-dimensional
curved space counterterms are not simply the covariant generalizations of the
flat ones, but contain additional curvature-dependent terms. We illustrate our
formalism in four and six dimensions. In the first case we rederive the results
of DeWitt-Brehme-Hobbs in a simpler way, in the second case we give a covariant
generalization of the Kosyakov equation. The local part of the reaction force
is found to contain a term proportional to the Riemann tensor which is absent
in four dimensions.

motors on the dynamics of a cargo driven by multiple motors. The model
considered shares many commons with other recently proposed in the literature,
with the addition of direct interaction between motors and motor back steps.
The cargo is assumed to follow a continuum Langevin dynamics, while individual
motors evolve following a Monte Carlo algorithm based on experimentally
accessible probabilities for discrete forward and backward jumps, and
attachment and detachment rates. The links between cargo and motors are
considered as non linear springs. By means of numerical simulations we compute
the relevant quantities characterizing the dynamical properties of the system,
and we compare the results to those for non interacting motors. We find that
interactions lead to quite relevant changes in the force-velocity relation for
cargo, with a considerable reduction of the stall force, and cause also a
notable decrease of the run length. These effects are mainly due to
traffic-like phenomena in the microtubule. The consideration of several
parallel tracks for motors reduces such effects. However, we find that for
realistic values of the number of motors and the number of tracks, the
influence of interactions on the global parameters of transport of cargo are
far from being negligible. Our studies provide also an analysis of the
relevance of motor back steps on the modeling, and of the influence of
different assumptions for the detachment rates. In particular, we discuss these
two aspects in connection with the possibility of observing processive back
motion of cargo at large load forces.

  Evolutionary Algorithms",,,,,"cs.NE nlin.AO q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The interplay between mutation and selection plays a fundamental role in the
behaviour of evolutionary algorithms (EAs). However, this interplay is still
not completely understood. This paper presents a rigorous runtime analysis of a
non-elitist population-based EA that uses the linear ranking selection
mechanism. The analysis focuses on how the balance between parameter $\eta$,
controlling the selection pressure in linear ranking, and parameter $\chi$
controlling the bit-wise mutation rate, impacts the runtime of the algorithm.
The results point out situations where a correct balance between selection
pressure and mutation rate is essential for finding the optimal solution in
polynomial time. In particular, it is shown that there exist fitness functions
which can only be solved in polynomial time if the ratio between parameters
$\eta$ and $\chi$ is within a narrow critical interval, and where a small
change in this ratio can increase the runtime exponentially. Furthermore, it is
shown quantitatively how the appropriate parameter choice depends on the
characteristics of the fitness function. In addition to the original results on
the runtime of EAs, this paper also introduces a very useful analytical tool,
i.e., multi-type branching processes, to the runtime analysis of non-elitist
population-based EAs.

according to the Schramm-Loewner stochastic evolution and the boundary fields
inserted at the tip of the cut and at infinity. We study necessary and
sufficient conditions for boundary correlation functions to be SLE martingales.
Necessary conditions come from the requirement for the boundary field at the
tip of the cut to have a depth two null vector. Sufficient conditions are
established using Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations for boundary correlators.
Combining these two approaches, we show that in the case of G=SU(2) the
boundary correlator is an SLE martingale if and only if the boundary field
carries spin 1/2. In the case of G=SU(n) and k=1, there are several situations
when boundary one-point correlators are SLE(kappa)-martingales. If the boundary
field is labelled by the defining n-dimensional representation of SU(n), we
obtain kappa=2. For n even, by choosing the boundary field labelled by the
(unique) self-adjoint fundamental representation, we get kappa=8/(n+2). We also
study the situation when the distance between the two boundary fields is
finite, and we show that in this case the SLE(kappa) evolution is replaced by
SLE(kappa,rho) with rho=kappa-6.

then saturates. Moreover, we find that the fraction of GORES is modulated by
the absolute line-of-sight velocity (ALOSV): at all projected radii, higher
fractions of GORES are found in higher ALOSV galaxies. We model this velocity
modulation of GORES fraction using the particles in a hydrodynamical
cosmological simulation, which we classify into virialized, infalling and
backsplash according to their position in radial phase space at z=0. Our
simplest model, where the GORES fraction is only a function of class does not
produce an adequate fit to our observed GORES fraction in projected phase
space. On the other hand, assuming that in each class the fraction of GORES
rises linearly and then saturates, we are able to find well-fitting 3D models
of the fractions of GORES. In our best-fitting models, in comparison with 18%
in the virial cone and 13% in the virial sphere, GORES respectively account for
34% and 19% of the infalling and backsplash galaxies, and as much as 11% of the
virialized galaxies, possibly as a result of tidally induced star formation
from galaxy-galaxy interactions. At the virial radius, the fraction of GORES of
the backsplash population is much closer to that of the virialized population

non-equilibrated solute concentrations, a thermodynamic description is
developed on the level of an individual trajectory of transitions between
states. The concept of internal energy, intrinsic entropy and free energy for
states follows from a microscopic description using one assumption on
time-scale separation. A first law energy balance then allows the unique
identification of the heat dissipated in one transition. Consistency with the
second law on the ensemble level enforces both stochastic entropy as third
contribution to the entropy change involved in one transition and the local
detailed balance condition for the ratio between forward and backward rates for
any transition. These results follow without assuming weak coupling between the
enzyme and the solutes, ideal solution behavior or mass action law kinetics.
The present approach highlights both the crucial role of the intrinsic entropy
of each state and the physically questionable role of chemiostats for deriving
the first law for molecular motors subject to an external force under realistic
conditions.

advent of high-statistics photoproduction data from the CLAS detector at
Jefferson Lab. These data have multi-particle final states, allowing clean
identification of exclusive reactions associated with strange mesons and
baryons. Examples of physics results are: evidence for isospin interference in
the decay of the $\Lambda(1405)$ resonance; a strong suggestion of meson cloud
effects in the structure of the $\Sigma(1385)$ resonance; data from $K^*$
photoproduction that will test the existence of the purported $K_0(800)$ meson.
Properties of other hyperon resonances will also be studied in the near future.

  appear in COCOON 2013",,"10.1016/j.tcs.2014.06.008",,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Finding heavy-elements (heavy-hitters) in streaming data is one of the
central, and well-understood tasks. Despite the importance of this problem,
when considering the sliding windows model of streaming (where elements
eventually expire) the problem of finding L_2-heavy elements has remained
completely open despite multiple papers and considerable success in finding
L_1-heavy elements.
  In this paper, we develop the first poly-logarithmic-memory algorithm for
finding L_2-heavy elements in sliding window model. Since L_2 heavy elements
play a central role for many fundamental streaming problems (such as frequency
moments), we believe our method would be extremely useful for many
sliding-windows algorithms and applications. For example, our technique allows
us not only to find L_2-heavy elements, but also heavy elements with respect to
any L_p for 0<p<2 on sliding windows. Thus, our paper completely resolves the
question of finding L_p-heavy elements for sliding windows with
poly-logarithmic memory for all values of p since it is well known that for p>2
this task is impossible.
  Our method may have other applications as well. We demonstrate a broader
applicability of our novel yet simple method on two additional examples: we
show how to obtain a sliding window approximation of other properties such as
the similarity of two streams, or the fraction of elements that appear exactly
a specified number of times within the window (the rarity problem). In these
two illustrative examples of our method, we replace the current expected memory
bounds with worst case bounds.

of gravitational radiation and any other propagating degrees of freedom. For
gravitational waves, the dominant contribution is characterized by an effective
stress-energy tensor at future null infinity. We employ perturbation theory and
the short-wavelength approximation to compute this stress-energy tensor in a
wide class of alternative theories. We find that this tensor is generally a
modification of that first computed by Isaacson, where the corrections can
dominate over the general relativistic term. In a wide class of theories,
however, these corrections identically vanish at asymptotically flat, future,
null infinity, reducing the stress-energy tensor to Isaacson's. We exemplify
this phenomenon by first considering dynamical Chern-Simons modified gravity,
which corrects the action via a scalar field and the contraction of the Riemann
tensor and its dual. We then consider a wide class of theories with dynamical
scalar fields coupled to higher-order curvature invariants, and show that the
gravitational wave stress-energy tensor still reduces to Isaacson's. The
calculations presented in this paper are crucial to perform systematic tests of
such modified gravity theories through the orbital decay of binary pulsars or

Fermi liquid fixed point being reached to keep the superconducting pairing

accumulated entropy carried by the critical degrees of freedom, may arise
favorably from this instability.

that Palomar 13 is most likely near apogalacticon, which makes the cluster

quenching by continuously adding thermal energy to hot gaseous halos
quantitatively matches the red galaxy luminosity function and produces a
reasonable red sequence. Small discrepancies remain - a shallow red sequence
slope suggests that our models underestimate metal production or retention in
massive red galaxies, while a deficit of massive blue galaxies may reflect the
fact that observed heating is intermittent rather than continuous. Overall,
injection of energy into hot halo gas appears to be a necessary and sufficient

explain the observed discrepancy between thin accretion disk sizes inferred

provide excellent fits to the HST quasar composite without invoking global
Compton scattering atmospheres to explain the high levels of observed UV

are experimentally impractical owing to large spontaneous emission rates in the
alkali fermions. In this paper, we develop a scheme to generate Rashba SO
coupling with a low spontaneous emission extension to a recent experiment. We
show that this scheme generates a Fermi surface spin texture for $^{40}\rm{K}$
atoms, which is observable in time-of-flight measurements. The chiral spin
texture, together with conventional $s$-wave interactions leads to topological
superconductivity and non-Abelian Majorana quasiparticles.

models of f(R,G) type that would give us a zero anisotropic stress and study
the consequences for the viability of the actual model. For the special case of
a de Sitter background, we identify a subclass of models with the desired

stability of the model as well as the presence of extra degrees of freedom,
which seems to be a general feature of higher order gravity models.
Particularly, setting the anisotropic stress equal to zero for a de Sitter
background leads to a singularity that makes it impossible to reach the de

high-redshift Universe has long been established. Originating mainly in the
vicinity of young, massive stars and in association with accretion of large
bulks of matter, it is ideal for detecting young galaxies, the fundamental
building blocks of our Universe. Since many different processes shape the
spectrum and the spatial distribution of the Ly$\alpha$ photons in various
ways, a multitude of physical properties of galaxies can be unveiled. However,
this also makes the interpretation of Ly$\alpha$ observations notoriously
difficult. Because Ly$\alpha$ is a resonant line, it scatters on neutral
hydrogen, having its path length from the source to our telescopes vastly
increased, and taking it through regions of unknown physical conditions. In
this work, a numerical code capable of calculating realistically the radiative
transfer of Ly$\alpha$ is presented. The code is capable of performing the
radiative transfer in an arbitrary and adaptively refined distribution of
Ly$\alpha$ source emission, temperature and velocity field of the interstellar
and intergalactic medium, as well as density of neutral and ionized hydrogen,
and, particularly important, dust. Accordingly, it is applied to galaxies
simulated at high resolution, yielding a number of novel and interesting
results, most notably the escape fractions of Ly$\alpha$ photons, the effect of
dust on the line profile, and the impact of the transfer through the
intergalactic medium. Furthermore, the remarkable detection of Ly$\alpha$
emission from a so-called ""damped Ly$\alpha$ absorber"" -- a special type of
objects thought to be the progenitor of present-day's galaxies -- is presented,
and the potential of the code for interpreting observations is demonstrated.

bulges (classical bulges). First of all, the distribution of the apparent bulge
axis ratio q_b for the subsample with n<2 can be attributed to triaxial, nearly
prolate bulges, while n>=2 bulges seem to be oblate spheroids with moderate
flattening. Secondly, the Photometric Plane of the sample bulges is not flat

the existence of a clear relation between the flattening of stellar discs h/z_0

such transitions occur between flat directions of the potential energy

deformations of the vector bundle which preserve the rank of the gauge bundle
and those which change the rank. In the latter case, our results provide
explicit solutions to a class of Li-Yau type deformation problems. Finally, we

where the weights of the elements in the input dataset are uncertain. The class
of problems that we study includes shortest paths, minimum weight spanning
trees, and minimum weight matchings, and other combinatorial problems like
knapsack. We observe that the expected value is inadequate in capturing
different types of {\em risk-averse} or {\em risk-prone} behaviors, and instead
we consider a more general objective which is to maximize the {\em expected
utility} of the solution for some given utility function, rather than the
expected weight (expected weight becomes a special case). Under the assumption
that there is a pseudopolynomial time algorithm for the {\em exact} version of
the problem (This is true for the problems mentioned above), we can obtain the
following approximation results for several important classes of utility
functions: (1) If the utility function $\uti$ is continuous, upper-bounded by a
constant and $\lim_{x\rightarrow+\infty}\uti(x)=0$, we show that we can obtain
a polynomial time approximation algorithm with an {\em additive error}
$\epsilon$ for any constant $\epsilon>0$. (2) If the utility function $\uti$ is
a concave increasing function, we can obtain a polynomial time approximation
scheme (PTAS). (3) If the utility function $\uti$ is increasing and has a
bounded derivative, we can obtain a polynomial time approximation scheme. Our
results recover or generalize several prior results on stochastic shortest
path, stochastic spanning tree, and stochastic knapsack. Our algorithm for
utility maximization makes use of the separability of exponential utility and a

large intrinsic column density (nH = 16e22 /cm2), and constrain the cutoff
energy for the first time (Ec = 19 keV). We observed a prolonged (> 30 ks)
attenuation of the X-ray flux which we tentatively attribute to an eclipse of
the probable neutron star by its massive companion. For IGR J17391-3021, we
witnessed a transition from quiescence to a low-activity phase punctuated by
weak flares whose peak luminosities in the 0.5--10 keV band are only a factor
of 5 times that of the pre-flare emission. The weak flaring is accompanied by
an increase in the absorbing column which suggests the accretion of obscuring
clumps of wind. Placing this observation in the context of the recent Swift
monitoring campaign, we now recognize that these low-activity epochs constitute
the most common emission phase for this system, and perhaps in other SFXTs as
well.

95GHz, operating on the Chajnantor plateau in the Atacama Desert in Chile, to
measure the anisotropy in the polarization of the CMB. QUIET primarily targets
the B modes from primordial gravitational waves. The combination of these
frequencies gives sensitivity to foreground contributions from diffuse Galactic
synchrotron radiation. Between 2008 October and 2010 December, >10,000hours of
data were collected, first with the 19-element 43GHz array (3458hours) and then
with the 90-element 95GHz array. Each array observes the same four fields,
selected for low foregrounds, together covering ~1000deg^2. This paper reports
initial results from the 43GHz receiver which has an array sensitivity to CMB
fluctuations of 69uK sqrt(s). The data were extensively studied with a large
suite of null tests before the power spectra, determined with two independent
pipelines, were examined. Analysis choices, including data selection, were
modified until the null tests passed. Cross correlating maps with different
telescope pointings is used to eliminate a bias. This paper reports the EE, BB
and EB power spectra in the multipole range ell=25-475. With the exception of
the lowest multipole bin for one of the fields, where a polarized foreground,
consistent with Galactic synchrotron radiation, is detected with 3sigma
significance, the E-mode spectrum is consistent with the LCDM model, confirming
the only previous detection of the first acoustic peak. The B-mode spectrum is
consistent with zero, leading to a measurement of the tensor-to-scalar ratio of
r=0.35+1.06-0.87. The combination of a new time-stream double-demodulation
technique, Mizuguchi-Dragone optics, natural sky rotation, and frequent
boresight rotation leads to the lowest level of systematic contamination in the
B-mode power so far reported, below the level of r=0.1

accretion disc. Magnetic fields are thought to play a leading role in this,
both by determining the location of the inner edge of the disc and by exerting
an additional torque on the star (as a result of the interaction between the
stellar magnetic field and the disc plasma motion, which creates a toroidal
component B_phi). In some well-known analytic models, developed in the 1980s,
the B_phi profile was taken to be proportional to the relative angular velocity
between the disc plasma and the neutron star, multiplied by a vertical dipolar
field. The present work stands in the line of improving those models,
suggesting a new profile for B. In a previous paper, we discussed the poloidal
component of the magnetic field and here we consider the toroidal component,
again making the kinematic approximation and looking for steady solutions of
the induction equation for axisymmetric models. The poloidal magnetic field is
not assumed to be dipolar and the poloidal velocity field is not taken to be
zero everywhere. We also do not use the thin disc approximation to simplify the
induction equation but instead solve it numerically in full 2D. The profile
obtained in the earlier analytic models is shown to have very limited validity
and a more general semi-analytic solution is proposed.

of positive-definite Cauchy matrices naturally arises when constructing
rational approximations with a (near) optimally small $L^{\infty}$ error.
Specifically, given a rational function with $n$ poles in the unit disk, a
rational approximation with $m\ll n$ poles in the unit disk may be obtained
from the $m$th con-eigenvector of an $n\times n$ Cauchy matrix, where the
associated con-eigenvalue $\lambda_{m}>0$ gives the approximation error in the
$L^{\infty}$ norm. Unfortunately, standard algorithms do not accurately compute
small con-eigenvalues (and the associated con-eigenvectors) and, in particular,
yield few or no correct digits for con-eigenvalues smaller than the machine
roundoff. We develop a fast and accurate algorithm for computing
con-eigenvalues and con-eigenvectors of positive-definite Cauchy matrices,
yielding even the tiniest con-eigenvalues with high relative accuracy. The
algorithm computes the $m$th con-eigenvalue in $\mathcal{O}(m^{2}n)$ operations
and, since the con-eigenvalues of positive-definite Cauchy matrices decay
exponentially fast, we obtain (near) optimal rational approximations in
$\mathcal{O}(n(\log\delta^{-1})^{2})$ operations, where $\delta$ is the
approximation error in the $L^{\infty}$ norm. We derive error bounds
demonstrating high relative accuracy of the computed con-eigenvalues and the
high accuracy of the unit con-eigenvectors. We also provide examples of using
the algorithm to compute (near) optimal rational approximations of functions
with singularities and sharp transitions, where approximation errors close to
machine precision are obtained. Finally, we present numerical tests on random
(complex-valued) Cauchy matrices to show that the algorithm computes all the
con-eigenvalues and con-eigenvectors with nearly full precision.

benefit of a larger number of cooperating antennas and the cost of estimating

simplified downlink scheduling scheme that pre-selects the users according to
probabilities obtained from the large-system results, depending on the desired

(finite-dimensional) opportunistic user selection while requiring significantly
less channel state feedback, since only a small fraction of pre-selected users

systems. They are powered by mass transfer from a low-mass, main sequence star
onto a white dwarf. The material piles up under degenerate conditions and a
thermonuclear runaway ensues. The energy released by the suite of nuclear
processes operating at the envelope heats the material up to peak temperatures
of ~ (1 - 4) \times 108 K. During these events, about 10-4 - 10-5 M\odot,
enriched in CNO and other intermediate-mass elements, are ejected into the
interstellar medium. To account for the gross observational properties of
classical novae (in particular, a metallicity enhancement in the ejecta above
solar values), numerical models assume mixing between the (solar-like) material
transferred from the companion and the outermost layers (CO- or ONe-rich) of
the underlying white dwarf. The nature of the mixing mechanism that operates at
the core-envelope interface has puzzled stellar modelers for about 40 years.
Here we investigate the role of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities as a natural
mechanism for self-enrichment of the accreted envelope with core material. The
feasibility of this mechanism is studied by means of the multidimensional code
FLASH. Here, we present a series of 9 numerical simulations perfomed in two
dimensions aimed at testing the possible influence of the initial perturbation
(duration, strength, location, and size), the resolution adopted, or the size
of the computational domain on the results. We show that results do not depend
substantially on the specific choice of these parameters, demonstrating that
Kelvin- Helmholtz instabilities can naturally lead to self-enrichment of the
accreted envelope with core material, at levels that agree with observations.

M$_\odot$ for the black widow pulsar. Using a simple analytic model related to
the so-called maximally compact equation of state, model-independent upper
limits to thermodynamic properties in neutron stars, such as energy density,
pressure, baryon number density and chemical potential, are established which
depend upon the neutron star maximum mass. Using the largest well-measured
neutron star mass, 1.97 M$_\odot$, it is possible to show that the energy
density can never exceed about 2 GeV, the pressure about 1.3 GeV, and the
baryon chemical potential about 2.1 GeV. Further, if quark matter comprises a
significant component of neutron star cores, these limits are reduced to 1.3
GeV, 0.9 GeV, and 1.5 GeV, respectively. We also find that the maximum binding
energy of any neutron star is about 25% of the rest mass. Neutron matter
properties and astrophysical constraints additionally imply an upper limit to
the neutron star maximum mass of about 2.4 M$_\odot$. A measured mass of 2.4

accreted and the total AGN light emitted per unit volume in the universe
integrated over time (the Soltan argument). In individual AGN, thin accretion
disk model spectral fits can be used to deduce the absolute accretion rate
Mdot, if the black hole mass M is known. The radiative efficiency {\eta} is
then set by the ratio of the bolometric luminosity L_bol to Mdot c^2. We apply
this method to determine {\eta} in a sample of 80 PG quasars with well
determined L_bol, where Mdot is set by thin accretion disk model fits to the
optical luminosity density, and the M determination based on the bulge stellar
velocity dispersion (13 objects) or the broad line region (BLR). For the
BLR-based masses, we derive a mean log {\eta} = -1.05 +/- 0.52 consistent with
the Soltan argument based estimates. We find a strong correlation of {\eta}
with M, rising from {\eta} ~ 0.03 at M = 10^7 M{\odot} and L/L_Edd ~ 1 to
{\eta} ~ 0.4 at M = 10^9 M{\odot} and L/L_Edd ~ 0.3. This trend is related to
the overall uniformity of L_opt/L_bol in our sample, particularly the lack of
the expected increase in L_opt/L_bol with increasing M (and decreasing
L/L_Edd), which is a generic property of thermal disk emission at fixed {\eta}.
The significant uncertainty in the M determination is not large enough to
remove the correlation. The rising {\eta} with M may imply a rise in the black
hole spin with M, as proposed based on other indirect arguments.

conducted using new, low-noise 7-yr WMAP data as well as an all-sky sample of
X-ray selected galaxy clusters compiled exclusively from published catalogs.
Our analysis of the CMB signature of the kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ)
effect finds a statistically significant dipole at the location of galaxy
clusters. The residual dipole outside the cluster regions is small, rendering
our overall measurement 3-4 sigma significant. The amplitude of the dipole
correlates with cluster properties, being larger for the most X-ray luminous
clusters, as required if the signal is produced by the SZ effect. Since it is
measured at zero monopole, the dipole can not be due to the thermal SZ effect.
Our results are consistent with those obtained earlier by us from 5-yr WMAP
data and using a proprietary cluster catalog. In addition, they are robust to
quadrupole removal, demonstrating that quadrupole leakage contributes
negligibly to the signal. The lower noise of the 7-yr WMAP also allows us, for
the first time, to obtain tentative empirical confirmation of our earlier
conjecture that the adopted filtering flips the sign of the KSZ effect for
realistic clusters and thus of the deduced direction of the flow. The latter is
consistent with our earlier measurement in both the amplitude and direction.
Assuming the filtering indeed flips the sign of the KSZ effect from the
clusters, the direction agrees well also with the results of independent work
using galaxies as tracers at lower distances. We make all maps and cluster
templates derived by us from public data available to the scientific community

derive analytic solutions for this correction factor and confirm our results

proton-deuteron (pd) scattering and breakup to the case when also a
three-nucleon force (3NF) is acting. In addition we formulate that approach in
the application to electron- and gamma-induced reactions on 3He. The main new
ingredient is a 3-dimensional screened pp Coulomb t-matrix obtained by a
numerical solution of a 3-dimensional Lippmann-Schwinger equation (LSE). The
resulting equations have the same structure as the Faddeev equations which
describe pd scattering without 3NF acting. That shows the practical feasibility
of both presented formulations.

hot, X-ray emitting, envelope surrounds the cloud, it has a very strong
internal magnetic field and its darkest core seems to be on astronomical time
scales ""just about"" to start forming stars. In order to probe the magnetic
environment of the cloud and to compare with the optical/near infrared
polarimetry-based field estimates for the cloud, we have acquired Faraday
Rotation measurements towards the pulsar PSR J1210$-$6550, probing the magnetic
field in the vicinity of the cloud, and a comparison target, PSR J1435$-$5954,
at a similar line of sight distance but several degrees from the cloud. Both
lines of sight hence primarily probe the UCL super bubble. The earlier
estimates of the magnetic field inside the Coalsack, using the
Chandrasekhar-Fermi method on optical and near-infrared polarimetry, yield
B$_\perp$ = 64--93 $\mu$G. However, even though PSR J1210$-$6550 is located
only $\sim$30 arc minutes from the (CO) edge of the cloud, the measured field
strength is only B$_\parallel$ = 1.1$\pm$0.2 $\mu$G. While thus yielding a very
high field contrast to the cloud we argue that this might be understood as due
to the effects on the cloud by the super bubble.

based on meson-baryon coupled-channels chiral dynamics, by evaluating density
distributions obtained from the form factors of the Lambda(1405) state. The
form factors are defined as an extension of the ordinary stable particles and
are directly evaluated from the meson-baryon scattering amplitude, paying
attention to the charge conservation of the probe interaction. For the resonant
Lambda(1405) state we calculate the density distributions in two ways. One is
on the pole position of the Lambda(1405) in the complex energy plane, which
evaluates the resonant Lambda(1405) structure without contamination from
nonresonant backgrounds, and another on the real energy axis around the
Lambda(1405) resonance energy, which may be achieved in experiments. Using
sereval probe interactions and channel decomposition, we separate the various
contributions to the internal structure of the Lambda(1405). As a result, we
find that the resonant Lambda(1405) state is composed of widely spread Kbar
around N, which gives dominant component inside the Lambda(1405), with escaping
pi Sigma component. Furthermore, we consider Kbar N bound state without decay
channels, with which we can observe the internal structure of the bound state
within real numbers. We also study the dependence of the form factors on the
binding energy and meson mass. This verifies that the form factor defined
through the scattering amplitude serves as a natural generalization of the form
factor for the resonance state. The relation between the interaction strength
and the meson mass shows that the physical kaon mass appears to be within the
suitable range to form a molecular bound state with the nucleon through the
chiral SU(3) interaction.

the kinematics of galaxies. To learn more about the large scale structures and
accretion processes, the extended environment of galaxies have to be observed.
Numerical simulations predict a cosmic web of extended structures and gaseous
filaments. To observe the direct vicinity of galaxies, column densities have to
be achieved that probe the regime of Lyman limit systems. Typically HI
observations are limited to a brightness sensitivity of NHI ~ 10^19 cm-2 but
this has to be improved by ~2 orders of magnitude. With the Westerbork
Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) we map the galaxy filament connecting the
Virgo Cluster with the Local Group. About 1500 square degrees on the sky is
surveyed, with Nyquist sampled pointings. By using the WSRT antennas as single
dish telescopes instead of the more conventional interferometer we are very
sensitive to extended emission. The survey consists of a total of 22,000
pointings and each pointing has been observed for 2 minutes with 14 antennas.
We reach a flux sensitivity of 16 mJy beam-1 over 16 km s-1, corresponding to a
brightness sensitivity of NHI ~ 3.5 \times 10^16 cm-2 for sources that fill the
beam. At a typical distance of 10 Mpc probed by this survey, the beam extent
corresponds to about 145 kpc in linear scale. Although the processed data cubes
are affected by confusion due to the very large beam size, we can identify most
of the galaxies that have been observed in HIPASS. Furthermore we made 20 new
candidate detections of neutral hydrogen. Several of the candidate detections
can be linked to an optical counterpart. The majority of the features however
do not show any signs of stellar emission. Their origin is investigated further
with accompanying HI surveys which will be published in follow up papers.

mixing angle with respect to the neutrino ones, offering a hint for a CPT
violation in lepton sector. However more recent MINOS data reduced the
neutrino-antineutrino differences leading to a narrow discrepancy almost
compatible with no CPT violation, hard to be disentangled. Moreover last a few
years of OPERA activity on tau appearance is still un-probed (one unique
event). Both flavor muon-tau mixing, tau appearance and eventual CPT violation
disentanglement need more tools to be enhanced. Atmospheric muon neutrino
spectra and anisotropy in Deep Core at ten-tens GeV (yet unpublished) may test
the muon-tau conversion but they can hardly reveal such last tiny MINOS CPT
asymmetry. We show how the longest baseline neutrino oscillation available,
crossing most of the Earth diameter, within an OPERA-like experiment from CERN
(or FERMILAB) to ICECUBE-Deep Core neutrino detector at 21 GeV energy, may at
best disentangle even last tiny CPT violation (within 6 sigma a year) while
testing at highest rate tau-antitau appearance. We propose the muon neutrino
disappearance or (for any CPT violation) the partial anti-muon appearance at
the longest distances. Such a tuned detection experiment may lead to a clear
and strong signature of tau or anti-tau generation (even within its neutral
current noise background events): nearly one antitau or two tau a day. The tau
appearance signal is above (or within) 10 sigma a year, even for 1% OPERA-like
experiment. Peculiar configurations for theta_13 angle test and hierarchy
neutrino mass test may also be addressed by a Deep Core-PINGU array detector
observing electron neutrino shower at 6 GeV neutrino energy windows.

dispersed in an insulating continuous matrix the electrical connectedness is
established by interparticle quantum tunneling. A recent formulation of the
transport problem in this kind of composites treats each conducting particle as
electrically connected to all others via tunneling conductances to form a
global tunneling network. Here, we extend this approach to nonhomogeneous
composites with a segregated distribution of the conducting phase. We consider
a model of segregation in which large random insulating spherical inclusions
forbid small conducting particles to occupy homogeneously the volume of the
composite, and allow tunneling between all pairs of the conducting objects. By
solving numerically the corresponding tunneling resistor network, we show that
the composite conductivity is enhanced by segregation and that it may remain
relatively large also for very small values of the conducting filler
concentration. We interpret this behavior by a segregation-induced reduction of
the interparticle distances, which is confirmed by a critical path
approximation applied to the segregated network. Furthermore, we identify an
approximate but accurate scaling relation permitting to express the
conductivity of a segregated systems in terms of the interparticle distances of
a corresponding homogeneous system, and which provides an explicit formula for
the conductivity which we apply to experimental data on segregated RuO2-cermet

component of the solar system abundances is primarily due to the 22Ne neutron
source, which is activated near the end of helium-core burning. The residual
22Ne left over from helium-core burning is then reignited during carbon
burning, initiating further s-processing that modifies the isotopic
distribution. This modification is sensitive to the stellar structure and the
carbon burning reaction rate. Recent work on the 12C + 12C reaction suggests
that resonances located within the Gamow peak may exist, causing a strong
increase in the astrophysical S-factor and consequently the reaction rate. To
investigate the effect of an increased rate, 25 solar mass stellar models with
three different carbon burning rates, at solar metallicity, were generated
using the Geneva Stellar Evolution Code (GENEC) with nucleosynthesis
post-processing calculated using the NuGrid Multi-zone Post-Processing Network
code (MPPNP). The strongest rate caused carbon burning to occur in a large
convective core rather than a radiative one. The presence of this large
convective core leads to an overlap with the subsequent convective
carbon-shell, significantly altering the initial composition of the
carbon-shell. In addition, an enhanced rate causes carbon-shell burning
episodes to ignite earlier in the evolution of the star, igniting the 22Ne
source at lower temperatures and reducing the neutron density.

that {\theta}blue is 73\circ and {\theta}red is 78\circ. Compared to the
parameters initially estimated under an assumption of 45\circ
inclination-angle, the newly derived parameters are changed with different
factors. For instance, the timescales for the blue and the red lobes are
reduced by 0.31 and 0.21, respectively. Larger influences apply to mechanical
luminosity, driving force, and mass-loss rate. The comparisons between

The equilibrium configurations, described by the Fermi (or waterbag)
distribution, are equivalent to polytropes with index n=1/2. In the case of
bosons, we consider the Hartree approximation that becomes exact in a proper
thermodynamic limit. The equilibrium configurations are solutions of the mean
field Schr\""odinger equation with a cosine interaction. We show that the
homogeneous phase, that is unstable in the classical regime, becomes stable in
the quantum regime. This takes place through a first order phase transition for
fermions and through a second order phase transition for bosons where the
control parameter is the normalized Planck constant. In the case of fermions,
the homogeneous phase is stabilized by the Pauli exclusion principle while for
bosons the stabilization is due to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. As a
result, the thermodynamic limit is different for fermions and bosons. We point
out analogies between the quantum HMF model and the concepts of fermion and

they can be detected by the way that massive and massless test particles move
in the space-time of these cosmic superstrings, in particular we study
solutions to the geodesic equation in the space-time of field theoretical
(p,q)-strings. The geodesics can be classified according to the test particle's
energy, angular momentum and momentum in the direction of the string axis. We
discuss how the change of the magnetic fluxes, the ratio between the symmetry
breaking scale and the Planck mass, the Higgs to gauge boson mass ratios and
the binding between the F- and D-strings, respectively, influence the motion of
the test particles. While massless test particles can only move on escape
orbits, a new feature as compared to the infinitely thin string limit is the
existence of bound orbits for massive test particles. In particular, we observe
that - in contrast to the space-time of a single Abelian-Higgs string - bound
orbits for massive test particles in (p,q)-string space-times are possible if
the Higgs boson mass is larger than the gauge boson mass. We also compute the
effect of the binding between the p- and the q-string on observables such as
the light deflection and the perihelion shift. While light deflection can also
be caused by other matter distributions, the possibility of a negative
perihelion shift seems to be a feature of finite width cosmic strings that
could lead to the unmistakable identification of such objects. In Melvin
space-times, which are asymptotically non-conical, massive test particles have
to move on bound orbits, while massless test particles can only escape to
infinity if their angular momentum vanishes.

they are accessible to statistical mechanics tools for spin glasses and

may cause problems in some models when parameter choices are unrealistic from a
biological perspective. Obviously, this may limit the role of a model as a
template model for biological systems. Perhaps less obviously, also ensembles
of random networks are affected and may exhibit different critical properties.
We consider here a prototypical network model that is biologically plausible in
its local mechanisms. We study a discrete dynamical network with two
characteristic properties: Nodes with binary states 0 and 1, and a modified
threshold function with $\Theta_0(0)=0$. We explore the critical properties of
random networks of such nodes and find a critical connectivity $K_c=2.0$ with
activity vanishing at the critical point. Finally, we observe that the present
model allows a more natural implementation of recent models of budding yeast

lipids to the bilayer which forms the vesicle membrane. The thermodynamic
description is based on the hydrodynamics of a water{/}lipid mixture together
with a model of the vesicle as a discontinuous system in the sense of linear
nonequilibrium thermodynamics. This formulation allows the forces and fluxes
relevant to the dynamic stability of the vesicle to be identified. The method
is used to analyze the stability of a spherical vesicle against arbitrary
axisymmetric perturbations. It is found that there are generically two critical
radii at which changes of stability occur. In the case where the perturbation
takes the form of a single zonal harmonic, only one of these radii is physical
and is given by the ratio $2 L_p / L_\gamma$, where $L_p$ is the hydraulic
conductivity and $L_\gamma$ is the Onsager coefficient related to changes in
membrane area due to lipid accretion. The stability of such perturbations is
related to the value of $l$ corresponding to the particular zonal harmonic:
those with lower $l$ are more unstable than those with higher $l$. Possible
extensions of the current work and the need for experimental input are

vacancy shows a spin moment of 1.5 $\mu_B$ that increases to $\sim$2 $\mu_B$
when the graphene is in tension. The changes are more dramatic under
compression, in that the vacancy becomes non-magnetic when graphene is

formation of a heavily reconstructed vacancy structure that consists of two

metallic and the band gaps of hydrogenated ones varies with the diameter,

trust relationships become complex, however, it becomes difficult to define and
compute a consistent snapshot of the conflicting information. Previous
solutions to a related problem, the update reconciliation problem, are
dependent on the order in which the updates are processed and, therefore, do
not guarantee a globally consistent snapshot. This paper proposes the first
principled solution to the automatic conflict resolution problem in a community

a logic program. While evaluating stable models in general is well known to be
hard, even for very simple logic programs, we show that the conflict resolution
problem admits a PTIME solution. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the
first PTIME algorithm that allows conflict resolution in a principled way. We
further discuss extensions to negative beliefs and prove that some of these
extensions are hard. This work is done in the context of the BeliefDB project

typical semiconductor behavior upon decreasing the temperature. The conduction
electron contribution to the reflectivity is suppressed and the opening of a
direct and an indirect charge excitation gap in the far-infrared energy region
is observed. Those gap openings are characterized by a redistribution of
spectral weight of the optical conductivity in an energy region much larger
than the gap energies indicating that strong electron-electron correlations are
involved in the formation of the charge gap. Calculations of the optical
conductivity from the band structure also provided evidence for the presence of
strong electronic correlations. Analyzing the spectra with a fundamental
absorption across the gap of parabolic bands yields a direct gap at 130 meV and
two indirect gaps at 6 and 31 meV. The strong reduction in the free-carrier
concentration at low energies and low temperatures is also reflected in a
change in the asymmetry of the phonon absorption which indicates a change in

Delta_sigma, Delta_pi, and T_c for both alloys on a quantitative level. In
particular, the observed differences in the doping range of superconductivity
between Al and C doping indicate a pronounced influence of the doping site,
which can be explained naturally in the present approach without the need to
invoke interband scattering, suggesting that this factor plays only a minor

the few PNe to have both polar outflows (jets) travelling at $120\pm10$ km/s
and a close binary central star. The lightcurve observed with the Mercator
telescope reveals an orbital period of 0.535 days and an extremely large
amplitude (0.816 mag) due to irradiation of the companion by a very hot
pre-white dwarf. ETHOS 1 further strengthens the long suspected link between
binary central stars of planetary nebulae (CSPN) and jets. INT IDS and VLT FORS
spectroscopy of the CSPN reveals weak N III, C III and C IV emission lines seen
in other close binary CSPN and suggests many CSPN with these weak emission
lines are misclassified close binaries. We present VLT FORS imaging and
Manchester Echelle Spectrometer long slit observations from which a kinematic
model of the nebula is built. An unusual combination of bipolar outflows and a
spherical nebula conspire to produce an $X$-shaped appearance. The kinematic
age of the jets ($1750\pm250$ yrs/kpc) are found to be older than the inner
nebula ($900\pm100$ yrs/kpc) consistent with previous studies of similar PNe.
Emission line ratios of the jets are found to be consistent with reverse-shock
models for fast low-ionisation emitting regions (FLIERS) in PNe. Further
large-scale surveys for close binary CSPN will be required to securely
establish whether FLIERS are launched by close binaries.

longstanding puzzle. While young low-mass stars show a wide range of rotation
periods, many CTTS are slow rotators, spinning at a small fraction of break-up,
and their rotation period does not seem to shorten, despite the fact that they
are actively accreting and contracting. Matt & Pudritz (2005) proposed that the
spin-down torque of a stellar wind powered by a fraction of the accretion
energy would be strong enough to balance the spin-up torque due to accretion.
Since this model establishes a direct relation between accretion and ejection,
the observable stellar parameters (mass, radius, rotation period, magnetic
field) and the accretion diagnostics (accretion shock luminosity), can be used
to constraint the wind characteristics. In particular, since the accretion
energy powers both the stellar wind and the shock emission, we show in this
letter how the accretion shock luminosity L_UV can provide upper limits to the
spin-down efficiency of the stellar wind. It is found that luminous sources
with L_UV > 0.1 L_Sun and typical dipolar field components < 1 kG do not allow
spin equilibrium solutions. Lower luminosity stars (L_UV < 0.1 L_Sun) are
compatible with a zero-torque condition, but the corresponding stellar winds
are still very demanding in terms of mass and energy flux. We therefore
conclude that accretion powered stellar winds are unlikely to be the sole
mechanism to provide an efficient spin-down torque for accreting classical T
Tauri stars.

simulations of X-ray radiative transfer, using both a spherical and torus
geometry, and taking into account Compton scattering and Fe fluorescence. We
use this data to show that with a torus geometry, unobscured sight lines can
achieve a maximum EW of the Fe K\alpha line of ~150 eV, originally shown by
Ghisellini, Haardt & Matt (1994). In order for this to be exceeded, the line of
sight must be obscured with N_H>10^23 cm^-2, as we show for one case, NGC 3690.
We also calculate flux suppression factors from the simulated data, the main
conclusion from which is that for N_H>10^25 cm^-2, the X-ray flux is suppressed
by a factor of >10 in all X-ray bands and at all redshifts, revealing the
biases present against these extremely heavily obscured systems inherent in all
X-ray surveys. Furthermore, we confirm previous results from Murphy & Yaqoob
(2009) that show that the reflection fraction determined from slab geometries
is underestimated with respect to toroidal geometries. For the 12 micron
selected galaxies, we investigate the distribution of X-ray power-law indices,
finding that the mean $<\Gamma>=1.90_{-0.07}^{+0.05}$ and $\sigma_\Gamma =
0.31_{-0.05}^{+0.05}$) is consistent with previous works, and that the
distribution of \Gamma for obscured and unobscured sources is consistent with
the source populations being the same, in general support of unification
schemes. We determine a Compton thick fraction for the X-ray AGN in our sample
to be 18+/-5% which is higher than the hard X-ray (>10 keV) selected samples.
Finally we find that the obscured fraction for our sample is a strong function
of X-ray luminosity, peaking at L_X~10^42-43 ergs s^-1.

light curves with seven new transits, which were observed between February 2008

Chile. We provide a revised planetary radius of R_p = 1.23+/-0.07 R_J, which is
slightly larger than, but consistent within the errors, of the previously
published results. Analysis of the planet-to-star radius ratio, orbital
separation, inclination and transit duration reveals no apparent variation in
any of those parameters during the time span observed. We also find no sign of
transit timing variations larger than -108+/-49 s, with most residuals very
close to zero. This allows us to place an upper limit of 5-10 M_Earth for a
coplanar, low-eccentricity perturber in either the 2:1 or 3:2 mean-motion
resonance with OGLE-TR-132b. We similarly find that the data are entirely

separation into Ce-rich and Zr-rich oxides. We estimate that the maximum
equilibrium concentration of Zr in CeO2 at 1373 K is ~2%, and therefore
equilibrated samples with higher Zr content are expected to exhibit
heterogeneity at the atomic scale. We also demonstrate that in the vicinity of
the (111) surface, cation redistribution at high temperatures will occur with
significant Ce enrichment of the surface, which we attribute to the more
covalent character of Zr-O bonds compared to Ce-O bonds. Although the kinetic
barriers for cation diffusion normally prevent the decomposition/segregation of
ceria-zirconia solid solutions in typical catalytic applications, the
separation behaviour described here can be expected to occur in modern
three-way catalytic converters, where very high temperatures are reached.

this paper, we will construct a well-balanced gas-kinetic

scheme, we model the gravitational potential as a piecewise step function with
a potential jump at the cell interface. At the same time, the Liouville's
theorem and symplecticity preserving property of a Hamiltonian flow have been
used in the description of particles penetration, reflection, and deformation
through a potential barrier. The use of the symplecticity preserving property
for a Hamiltonian flow is crucial in the evaluation of the high-order moments
of a gas distribution function when crossing through a potential jump. As far
as we know, the SP-BGK method is the first shock capturing Navier-Stokes flow
solver with well-balanced property for a gravitational hydrodynamic system. A
few theorems will be proved for this scheme, which include the necessity to use
an exact Maxwellian for keeping the hydrostatic state, the total mass and
energy (the sum of kinetic, thermal, and gravitational ones) conservation, and
the well-balanced property to keep a hydrostatic state during particle
transport and collision processes. Many numerical examples will be presented to
validate the SP-BGK scheme.

which satisfy the source-free Maxwell equations can be linearly mapped into the
real and imaginary parts of a transverse-vector wave function which in
consequence satisfies the time-dependent Schroedinger equation whose
Hamiltonian operator is physically appropriate to the free photon. The
free-particle Klein-Gordon equation for scalar fields modestly extends the
classical wave equation via a mass term. It is physically untenable for
complex-valued wave functions, but has a sound nonnegative conserved-energy
functional when it is restricted to real-valued classical fields. Canonical
Hamiltonization and a further canonical transformation maps the real-valued
classical Klein-Gordon field and its canonical conjugate into the real and
imaginary parts of a scalar wave function (within a constant factor) which in
consequence satisfies the time-dependent Schroedinger equation whose
Hamiltonian operator has the natural correspondence-principle relativistic
square-root form for a free particle, with a mass that matches the Klein-Gordon
field theory's mass term. Quantization of the real-valued classical
Klein-Gordon field is thus second quantization of this natural
correspondence-principle first-quantized relativistic Schroedinger equation.
Source-free electromagnetism is treated in a parallel manner, but with the
classical scalar Klein-Gordon field replaced by a transverse vector potential
that satisfies the classical wave equation. This reproduces the previous
first-quantized results that were based on Maxwell's source-free electric and
magnetic field equations.
