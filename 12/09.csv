can be diffusively or repulsively coupled, and can serve as central pattern
generator models in animal locomotion and robotics. It is shown that repulsive
coupling generates out-of-phase oscillations, while diffusive coupling
generates synchronous oscillations. Specifically, symmetric solutions and their
corresponding amplitudes are derived, and contraction analysis is used to prove
global stability and convergence of oscillations to either symmetric
out-of-phase or synchronous states, depending on the coupling constant. Next,
the two mechanisms are used jointly by coupling multiple arrays. The resulting
dynamics is analyzed, in a model inspired by the CPG-motorneuron network that
controls the heartbeat of a medicinal leech.

plasmodium. We discovered a complex interplay of short range oscillatory
behaviour combined with long range, low frequency oscillations which serve to
communicate information between different parts of the plasmodium. The
plasmodium's response to changing environmental conditions forms basis patterns
of electric activity, which are unique indicators of the following events:
plasmodium occupies a site, plasmodium functions normally, plasmodium becomes
`agitated' due to drying substrate, plasmodium departs a site, and plasmodium
forms sclerotium. Using a collective particle approximation of Physarum
polycephalum we found matching correlates of electrical potential in
computational simulations by measuring local population flux at the node
positions, generating trains of high and low frequency oscillatory behaviour.
Motifs present in these measurements matched the response `grammar' of the
plasmodium when encountering new nodes, simulated consumption of nutrients,
exposure to simulated hazardous illumination and sclerotium formation. The
distributed computation of the particle collective was able to calculate
beneficial network structures and sclerotium position by shifting the active

correspond to fractions below 1%. Using the D+ --> K- pi+ pi+ channel as a

pi+ e+ nu_e) = (4.04 +- 0.03 +- 0.04 +- 0.09) \times 10^{-2} where the third

0.0074. Fixing the P-wave parameters we measure the phase of the S-wave for
several values of the Kpi mass. These results confirm those obtained with Kpi
production at small momentum transfer in fixed target experiments.

To clarify the origin of jet asymmetries and constrain their launch mechanism
we study the physical and kinematical structure of the flow emitted by DG Tau
B. The analysis of deep spectra taken at the KECK telescope allows us to infer
the physical properties (the electron and total density, ne and nh, the
ionisation fraction, xe, and the temperature, te) and the spatial distribution
of the velocity components in the two jet lobes. The presence of dust grains in
the jet is investigated by estimating the gas-phase abundance of calcium with
respect to its solar value. At the base of the jet the lines are broad (~100
km/s) and up to three velocity components are detected. At 5"" from the source,
however, only the denser and more excited high velocity components survive and
the lines are narrower (~10-30 km/s). The jet is strongly asymmetric both in
velocity and in its physical structure. The red lobe, slower (~140 km/s) and
more collimated, presents low ionisation fractions (xe~0.1-0.4) and
temperatures (te<5e3 K), while the total density is up to ~2.5e4 ccm. The blue
lobe, faster (~-320 km/s) and less collimated, is also less dense (nh~1e4 ccm)
but highly excited (te up to ~5e4 K and xe up to 0.9). The estimated mass loss
rate is similar in the two lobes (~6-8e-9 Msol/yr), suggesting that the
ejection power is comparable on the two sides of the system, as expected from a
magneto-centrifugal ejection mechanism, and that the observed asymmetries are
due to different mass load and propagation properties in an inhomogeneous
environment. Calcium is strongly depleted, indicating that the jet contains
dust grains and, therefore, should originate from a region of the disk
extending beyond the dust sublimation radius. The depletion is lower for higher
velocities, consistent with dust destruction by shocks.

It is well-known that new
K-rational points may be obtained from old ones by secant and tangent
constructions. A Mordell-Weil generating set is a subset B of S(K) of minimal
cardinality which generates S(K) via successive secant and tangent
constructions. Let r(S,K) be the cardinality of such a Mordell-Weil generating
set. Manin posed what is known as the Mordell-Weil problem for cubic surfaces:
if K is finitely generated over its prime subfield then r(S,K) is finite. In
this paper, we prove a special case of this conjecture. Namely, if S contains
two skew lines both defined over K then r(S,K) = 1. One of the difficulties in
studying the secant and tangent process on cubic surfaces is that it does not
lead to an associative binary operation as in the case of elliptic curves. As a
partial remedy we introduce an abelian group H_S(K) associated to a cubic
surface S/K, naturally generated by the K-rational points, which retains much
information about the secant and tangent process. In particular, r(S, K) is
large as soon as the minimal number of generators of H_S(K) is large. In
situations where weak approximation holds, H_S has nice local-to-global
properties. We use these to construct a family of smooth cubic surfaces over
the rationals such that r(S,K) is unbounded in this family. This is the cubic
surface analogue of the unboundedness of ranks conjecture for elliptic curves.

(Meakin and Arnett, 2007b) exhibit bursty, recurrent fluctuations in turbulent
kinetic energy. These are shown to be due to a general instability of the
convective cell, requiring only a localized source of heating or cooling. Such
fluctuations are shown to be suppressed in simulations of stellar evolution
which use mixing-length theory (MLT).
  Quantitatively similar behavior occurs in the model of a convective roll
(cell) of Lorenz (1963), which is known to have a strange attractor that gives
rise to chaotic fluctuations in time of velocity and, as we show, luminosity.
Study of simulations suggests that the behavior of a Lorenz convective roll may
resemble that of a cell in convective flow. We examine some implications of
this simplest approximation, and suggest paths for improvement.
  Using the Lorenz model as representative of a convective cell, a
multiple-cell model of a convective layer gives total luminosity fluctuations
which are suggestive of irregular variables (red giants and supergiants
(Schwarzschild 1975)), and of the long secondary period feature in semi-regular
AGB variables (Stothers 2010, Wood, Olivier and Kawaler 2004). This
""tau-mechanism"" is a new source for stellar variability, which is inherently
non-linear (unseen in linear stability analysis), and one closely related to
intermittency in turbulence. It was already implicit in the 3D global
simulations of Woodward, Porter and Jacobs (2003). This fluctuating behavior is
seen in extended 2D simulations of CNeOSi burning shells (Arnett and Meakin
2011b), and may cause instability which leads to eruptions in progenitors of
core collapse supernovae PRIOR to collapse.

CVRP), and present a constant-factor approximation algorithm.
  The technical heart of our result lies in achieving a constant approximation
to the following TSP variant (called Heterogenous TSP). Given a metric denoting
distances between vertices, a depot r containing k vehicles with possibly
different speeds, the goal is to find a tour for each vehicle (starting and
ending at r), so that every vertex is covered in some tour and the maximum
completion time is minimized. This problem is precisely Heterogenous CVRP when
vehicles are uncapacitated.
  The presence of non-uniform speeds introduces difficulties for employing
standard tour-splitting techniques. In order to get a better understanding of
this technique in our context, we appeal to ideas from the 2-approximation for
scheduling in parallel machine of Lenstra et al.. This motivates the
introduction of a new approximate MST construction called Level-Prim, which is
related to Light Approximate Shortest-path Trees. The last component of our
algorithm involves partitioning the Level-Prim tree and matching the resulting

be studied with unprecedented statistical significance. Low-mass stars dominate
the local Milky Way and are ideal tracers of the Galactic potential and the
thin and thick disks. Recent efforts, driven by SDSS observations, have sought
to place the local low-mass stellar population in a broader Galactic context. I
highlight a recent measurement of the luminosity and mass functions of M
dwarfs, using a new technique optimized for large surveys. Starting with SDSS
photometry, the field luminosity function and local Galactic structure are
measured simultaneously. The sample size used to estimate the LF is nearly
three orders of magnitude larger than any previous study, offering a definitive
measurement of this quantity. The observed LF is transformed into a mass
function and compared to previous studies. Ongoing investigations employing M
dwarfs as tracers of Galactic kinematics are also discussed. SDSS spectroscopy
has produced databases containing tens of thousands of low-mass stars, forming
a powerful probe of the kinematic structure of the Milky Way. SDSS
spectroscopic studies are complemented by large proper motion surveys, which
have uncovered thousands of common proper motion binaries containing low-mass
stars. Additionally, the SDSS spectroscopic data explore the intrinsic
properties of M dwarfs, including metallicity and magnetic activity. The
highlighted projects demonstrate the advantages and problems with using large

critical review of arguments for sequestering in supergravity and in string
theory. We then show that geometric isolation, even in a highly warped space,
is insufficient to achieve sequestering: in type IIB compactifications,
nonperturbative superpotentials involving the Kahler moduli introduce
cross-couplings between well-separated visible and hidden sectors. The scale of
the resulting soft terms depends on the moduli stabilization scenario. In the
Large Volume Scenario, nonperturbative superpotential contributions to the soft
trilinear $A$ terms can introduce significant flavor violation, while in KKLT
compactifications their effects are negligible. In both cases, the
contributions to the $\mu$ and $B\mu$ parameters cannot be ignored in general.
We conclude that sequestered supersymmetry breaking is possible in
nonperturbatively-stabilized compactifications only if a mechanism in addition

clustering of density peaks corresponding to rare objects. This variation,
parametrized by the bias, is investigated on scales where a linear perturbation
theory is sufficiently accurate. The bias is obtained directly in real space by
comparing the one- and two-point probability distributions of density
fluctuations. We show that these distributions can be reconstructed using a
bivariate Edgeworth series, presented here up to an arbitrarily high order. The
Edgeworth formalism is shown to be well-suited for 'local' cubic-order
non-Gaussianity parametrized by g_NL. We show that a strong scale-dependence in
the bias can be produced by g_NL of order 10,000, consistent with CMB
constraints. On correlation length of ~100 Mpc, current constraints on g_NL
still allow the bias for the most massive clusters to be enhanced by 20-30% of
the Gaussian value. We further examine the bias as a function of mass scale,
and also explore the relationship between the clustering and the abundance of
massive clusters in the presence of g_NL. We explain why the Edgeworth
formalism, though technically challenging, is a very powerful technique for
constraining high-order non-Gaussianity with large-scale structures.

We provide a general formula for Andreev levels which is valid for arbitrary

expected when ferromagnetism is driven by spin bandwidth asymmetry compared to
Stoner magnetism, and that the same mechanism is likely responsible for the

decays of heavy particles, we investigate strategies to identify the event
topologies based on the kinematic information of final state visible particles.
This should be the first step towards measuring the masses and spins of the new
particles in the decay chains including the dark matter particle. As a concrete
example, we study in detail the final states with 4 jets plus missing energy.
This is a particularly challenging scenario because of large experimental
smearing effects and no fundamental distinction among the 4 jets. Based on the
fact that the invariant mass of particles on the same decay chain has an end
point in its distribution, we define several functions which can distinguish
different topologies depending on whether they exhibit the end-point structure.
We show that all possible topologies (e.g., two jets on each decay chain or
three jets on one chain and the other jet on the other chain, and so on) in
principle can be identified from the distributions of these functions of the
visible particle momenta. We also consider cases with one jet from the initial
state radiation as well as off-shell decays. Our studies show that the event
topology may be identified with as few as several hundred signal events after
basic cuts. The method can be readily generalized to other event topologies. In
particular, event topologies including leptons will be easier because the end
points are expected to be sharper and there are more distinct invariant mass
distributions from different charges.

one-dimensional channels of particles with Yukawa interactions. For the two
channel system, when an external drive is applied only to the top or primary
channel, we find a transition from locked flow where particles in both channels
move together to decoupled flow where the particles in the secondary or
undriven channel move at a slower velocity than the particles in the primary or
driven channel. Pronounced commensurability effects in the decoupling
transition occur when the ratio of the number of particles in the top and
bottom channels is varied, and the coupling of the two channels is enhanced
when this ratio is an integer or a rational fraction. Near the commensurate
fillings, we find additional features in the velocity-force curves caused by
the slipping of individual vacancies or incommensurations in the secondary
channels. For three coupled channels, when only the top channel is driven we
find a remarkably rich variety of distinct dynamic phases, including multiple
decoupling and recoupling transitions. These transitions produce pronounced
signatures in the velocity response of each channel. We also find regimes where
a negative drag effect can be induced in one of the non-driven channels. The
particles in this channel move in the opposite direction from the particles in
the driven channel due to the mixing of the two different periodic frequencies
produced by the discrete motion of the particles in the two other channels. In
the two channel system, we also demonstrate a ratchet effect for the particles
in the secondary channel when an asymmetric drive is applied to the primary
channel. This ratchet effect is similar to that observed in superconducting
vortex systems when there is a coupling between two different species of
vortices.

(HAEs) in the field of the radio galaxy 4C 23.56 at z=2.483. Using the MOIRCS
near-infrared imager on the Subaru Telescope we found 11 candidate
emission-line galaxies to a flux limit of ~7.5 10^-17 erg s-1 cm-2, which is
about 5 times excess from the expected field counts with ~3-sigma significance.
Three of these are spectroscopically confirmed as redshifted Halpha at z=2.49.
The distribution of candidate emitters on the sky is tightly confined to a
1.2-Mpc-radius area at z=2.49, locating 4C 23.56 at the western edge of the
distribution. Analysis of the deep Spitzer MIPS 24 mu m imaging shows that
there is also an excess of faint MIPS sources. All but two of the 11 HAEs are
also found in the MIPS data. The inferred star-formation rate (SFR) of the HAEs
based on the extinction-corrected Halpha luminosity (median SFR >~100 M_solar
yr-1) is similar to those of HAEs in random fields at z~2. On the other hand,
the MIPS-based SFR for the HAEs is on average 3.6 times larger, suggesting the
existence of the star-formation significanly obscured by dust. The comparison
of the Halpha-based star-formation activities of the HAEs in the 4C 23.56 field
to those in another proto-cluster around PKS 1138-262 at z=2.16 reveals that

to chemical and meteorological factors) are removed via declusterisation. The
unknown rate function is estimated using a reversible jump MCMC sampling
algorithm adapted from Green (1995), which allows for transitions between
parameter subspaces of varying dimension. This technique is applied to the
17-year (1993-2009) daily NO2, NO and CO concentration data in the City of

three different models for populating dark matter halos with HI, designed to
encompass uncertainties at this redshift. These models are consistent with
recent observations of the detection of HI in emission at z ~ 0.8. Whilst
detection of 21 cm emission from individual halos requires extremely long
integrations with existing radio interferometers, such as the Giant Meter Radio
Telescope (GMRT), we show that the stacked 21 cm signal from a large number of
halos can be easily detected. However, the stacking procedure requires accurate
redshifts of galaxies. We show that radio observations of the field of the
DEEP2 spectroscopic galaxy redshift survey should allow detection of the HI
mass function at the 5-12 sigma level in the mass range 10^(11.4) M_sun/h <
M_halo < 10^(12.5)M_sun/h, with a moderate amount of observation time. Assuming
a larger noise level that corresponds to an upper bound for the expected noise
for the GMRT, the detection significance for the HI mass function is still at
the 1.7-3 sigma level. We find that optically undetected satellite galaxies
enhance the HI emission profile of the parent halo, leading to broader wings as
well as a higher peak signal in the stacked profile of a large number of halos.
We show that it is in principle possible to discern the contribution of
undetected satellites to the total HI signal, even though cosmic variance
limitation make this challenging for some of our models.

measurement of the relative contributions of star-formation and active galactic
nuclei (AGN) to the total IR emission from a large sample of local LIRGs. The
AGN contribution to the MIR emission (f-AGN) is estimated by employing several
diagnostics based on the properties of the [NeV], [OIV] and [NeII] fine
structure gas emission lines, the 6.2 microns PAH and the shape of the MIR
continuum. We find that 18% of all LIRGs contain an AGN and that in 10% of all
sources the AGN contributes more than 50% of the total IR luminosity. Summing
up the total IR luminosity contributed by AGN in all our sources suggests that
AGN supply ~12% of the total energy emitted by LIRGs. The average spectrum of
sources with an AGN looks similar to the average spectrum of sources without an
AGN, but it has lower PAH emission and a flatter MIR continuum. AGN dominated
LIRGs have higher IR luminosities, warmer MIR colors and are found in
interacting systems more often than pure starbursts LIRGs. However we find no
linear correlations between these properties and f-AGN. We used the IRAC colors
of LIRGs to confirm that finding AGN on the basis of their MIR colors may miss
~40% of AGN dominated (U)LIRGs

show new evidence of a fan-spine topology resulting from magnetic flux
emergence. This event, occurring in an equatorial coronal hole on 2007 February
9, was observed by the Hinode Solar Optical Telescope in the Ca II H line in
unprecedented detail. The predecessor of the jet is a bundle of fine material
threads that extend above the chromosphere and appear to rotate about the
bundle axis at ~50 km/s (period <200 s). These rotations or transverse
oscillations propagate upward at velocities up to 786 km/s. The bundle first
slowly and then rapidly swings up, with the transition occurring at the onset
of an A4.9 flare. A loop expands simultaneously in these two phases (velocity:
16-135 km/s). Near the peak of the flare, the loop appears to rupture;
simultaneous upward ejecta and mass downflows faster than free-fall appear in
one of the loop legs. The material bundle then swings back in a whiplike manner
and develops into a collimated jet, which is orientated along the inferred open
field lines with transverse oscillations continuing at slower rates. Some
material falls back along smooth streamlines, showing no more oscillations. At
low altitudes, the streamlines bifurcate at presumably a magnetic null point
and bypass an inferred dome, depicting an inverted-Y geometry. These
streamlines closely match in space the late Ca II H loop and X-ray flare loop.
These observations are consistent with the model that flux emergence in an
open-field region leads to magnetic reconnection, forming a jet and fan-spine
topology. We propose that the material bundle and collimated jet represent the
outer spine in quasi-static and eruptive stages, respectively, and the growing
loop is a 2D projection of the 3D fan surface.

method with a radial pre-sorting technique , and implement them on computer
graphics processing units (GPUs). The developed GPU-based gamma-index
computational tool is evaluated on eight pairs of IMRT dose distributions. The
GPU implementation achieved 20x~30x speedup factor compared to CPU

factors on both CPU and GPU computation time. The strategy of pre-sorting
voxels based on their dose difference values speed up the GPU calculation by
about 2-4 times. For n-dimensional dose distributions, gamma-index calculation
time on CPU is proportional to the summation of gamma^n over all voxels, while
that on GPU is effected by gamma^n distributions and is approximately
proportional to the gamma^n summation over all voxels. We found increasing dose
distributions resolution leads to quadratic increase of computation time on

random identically distributed noise in the preferences of each of the
participants. The randomness is McFadden-type, which permits an explicit
resolution of the equilibrium preference probabilities. The purpose of this
note is to prove uniqueness of the resulting equilibrium marriage distribution,
and find a representation of it in closed form. This allows us to derive smooth
dependence of this distribution on exogenous preference and population
parameters, and establish sign, symmetry, and size of the various substitution
effects, facilitating comparative statics. For example, we show that an
increase in the population of men of any given type in this model leads to an
increase in single men of each type, and a decrease in single women of each
type. We show that an increase in the number of men of a given type increases
the equilibrium transfer paid by such men to their spouses, and also increases
the percentage of men of that type who choose to remain unmarried. The
verification of such properties helps to substantiate the validity of the
model. Moreover, we make unexpected predictions which could be tested: the
percentage change of type $i$ unmarrieds with respect to fluctuations in the
total number of type $j$ men or women turns out to form a symmetric
positive-definite matrix $r_{ij}=r_{ji}$ in this model, and thus to satisfy
bounds like $|r_{ij}| \le (r_{ii}r_{jj})^{1/2}$. Along the way, we give a new
proof for the existence of an equilibrium, based on a strictly convex
variational principle and a simple estimate, rather than a fixed point theorem.
Fixed point approaches to the existence part of our result have been explored
by others \cite{CSS} \cite{Dag} \cite{Fox}, but are much more complicated and
yield neither uniqueness, nor comparative statics, nor an explicit

(semi-)groups and (semi-)rings, and many naive algebraic properties concerning
rings and groups have been extended to these $G$-bivariant analogous notions.
  In this article, we investigate a $G$-bivariant analog of the semi-group
rings with coefficients. Just as a coefficient ring $R$ and a monoid $Q$ yield
the semi-group ring $R[Q]$, our constrcution enables us to make a Tambara
functor $T[M]$ out of a semi-Mackey functor $M$, and a coefficient Tambara
functor $T$. This construction is a composant of the Tambarization and the
Dress construction.
  As expected, this construction is the one uniquely determined by the
righteous adjoint property. Besides in analogy with the trivial group case, if
$M$ is a Mackey functor, then $T[M]$ is equipped with a natural Hopf structure.
  Moreover, as an application of the above construction, we also obtain some
$G$-bivariant analogs of the polynomial rings.

important role in various tasks in the communities of machine learning and
signal processing. In this paper, we propose a novel model, named log-sum
heuristic recovery (LHR), to learn the essential low-rank structure from
corrupted data. Different from traditional approaches, which directly utilize
$\ell_1$ norm to measure the sparseness, LHR introduces a more reasonable
log-sum measurement to enhance the sparsity in both the intrinsic low-rank
structure and in the sparse corruptions. Although the proposed LHR optimization
is no longer convex, it still can be effectively solved by a
majorization-minimization (MM) type algorithm, with which the non-convex
objective function is iteratively replaced by its convex surrogate and LHR
finally falls into the general framework of reweighed approaches. We prove that
the MM-type algorithm can converge to a stationary point after successive
iteration. We test the performance of our proposed model by applying it to
solve two typical problems: robust principal component analysis (RPCA) and
low-rank representation (LRR).
  For RPCA, we compare LHR with the benchmark Principal Component Pursuit (PCP)
method from both the perspectives of simulations and practical applications.
For LRR, we apply LHR to compute the low-rank representation matrix for motion
segmentation and stock clustering. Experimental results on low rank structure
learning demonstrate that the proposed Log-sum based model performs much better
than the $\ell_1$-based method on for data with higher rank and with denser
corruptions.

Recalling that Faraoni [Amer. J. Phys. 67 (1999), 732-734] showed how to reduce
the barotropic FRW system of differential equations to simple harmonic
oscillator differential equations, we set the latter equations in the
supersymmetric approach and divide their solutions into two classes of
'bosonic' (nonsingular) and 'fermionic' (singular) cosmological zero-mode
solutions. The fermionic equations can be considered as representing
cosmologies of Stephani type, i.e., inhomogeneous and curvature-changing in the
conformal time. We next apply the so-called shifted Riccati procedure by
introducing a constant additive parameter, denoted by S, in the common Riccati
solution of these supersymmetric partner cosmologies. This leads to barotropic
Stephani cosmologies with periodic singularities in their spatial curvature
indices that we call U and V cosmologies, the first being of bosonic type and
the latter of fermionic type. We solve completely these cyclic singular
cosmologies at the level of their zero modes showing that an acceptable shift
parameter should be purely imaginary, which in turn introduces a parity-time
(PT) property of the partner curvature indices.

from a formation location much farther from their host star. In the late stages
of planetary formation, once the gas in the proto-planetary disk has dissipated
and migration has halted, gas-giants orbiting in the inner disk regions will
excite planetesimals and planetary embryos, resulting in an increased rate of
orbital crossings and large impacts. We present the results of dynamical

destroyed at zero temperature by quantum fluctuations, which induce $2\pi$
slips of the phase of the order parameter. However, in a finite-length wire
coherent quantum phase-slips would manifest themselves simply as shifts of
energy levels in the excitations spectrum of an electrical circuit
incorporating this wire. The higher the phase-slips probability amplitude, the
larger are the shifts. Phase-slips occurring at different locations along the
wire interfere with each other. Due to the Aharonov-Casher effect, the
resulting full amplitude of a phase-slip depends on the offset charges
surrounding the wire. Slow temporal fluctuations of the offset charges make the
phase-slips amplitudes random functions of time, and therefore turn energy
levels shifts into linewidths. We experimentally observed this effect on a long
Josephson junction array acting as a ""slippery"" wire. The slip-induced
linewidths, despite being only of order 100 kHz, were resolved from the
flux-dependent dephasing of the fluxonium qubit.

applications to various areas of research are being explored. It is a novel
interpretation of strategies and decisions in quantum domain. In the earlier
work on quantum games considerable attention was given to the resolution of
dilemmas present in corresponding classical games. Two separate quantum schemes
were presented by Eisert et al. and Marinatto and Weber to resolve dilemmas in
Prisoners' Dilemma and Battle of Sexes games respectively. However for the
latter scheme it was argued that dilemma was not resolved. We have modified the
quantization scheme of Marinatto and Weber to resolve the dilemma. We have
developed a generalized quantization scheme for two person non-zero sum games
which reduces to the existing schemes under certain conditions. Applications of
this generalized quantization scheme to quantum information theory are studied.
Measurement being ubiquitous in quantum mechanics can not be ignored in quantum
games. With the help of generalized quantization scheme we have analyzed the
effects of measurement on quantum games. Qubits are the important elements for
playing quantum games and are generally prone to decoherence due to their
interactions with environment. An analysis of quantum games in presence of
quantum correlated noise is performed in the context of generalized
quantization scheme. Quantum key distribution is one of the key issues of
quantum information theory for the purpose of secure communication. Using
mathematical framework of generalized quantization scheme we have proposed a
protocol for quantum key distribution and a technique for quantum state

demonstration of dynamical back-action cooling and optical rigidity of the
mechanical system. Conversely, the optical response of these systems is also
modified in the presence of mechanical interactions, leading to strong
nonlinear effects such as Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) and
parametric normal-mode splitting. In atomic systems, seminal experiments and
proposals to slow and stop the propagation of light, and their applicability to
modern optical networks, and future quantum networks, have thrust EIT to the
forefront of experimental study during the last two decades. In a similar
fashion, here we use the optomechanical nonlinearity to control the velocity of
light via engineered photon-phonon interactions. Our results demonstrate EIT
and tunable optical delays in a nanoscale optomechanical crystal device,
fabricated by simply etching holes into a thin film of silicon (Si). At low

(variable) demand has to be assigned to exactly one subset of resources. The
players' incentives to use higher demands are stimulated by non-decreasing and
concave utility functions. The payoff for a player is defined as the difference
between the utility of the demand and the associated cost on the used
resources. Although this class of non-cooperative games captures many elements
of real-world applications, it has not been studied in this generality, to our
knowledge, in the past. We study the fundamental problem of the existence of
pure Nash equilibria (PNE for short) in congestion games with variable demands.
We call a set of cost functions C consistent if every congestion game with
variable demands and cost functions in C possesses a PNE. We say that C is FIP
consistent if every such game possesses the alpha-Finite Improvement Property
for every alpha>0. Our main results are structural characterizations of
consistency and FIP consistency for twice continuously differentiable cost
functions. Specifically, we show 1. C is consistent if and only if C contains
either only affine functions or only homogeneously exponential functions (c(x)
= a exp(p x)). 2. C is FIP consistent if and only if C contains only affine
functions. Our results provide a complete characterization of consistency of
cost functions revealing structural differences to congestion games with fixed
demands (weighted congestion games), where in the latter even inhomogeneously
exponential functions are FIP consistent. Finally, we study consistency and FIP
consistency of cost functions in a slightly different class of games, where
every player experiences the same cost on a resource (uniform cost model). We
give a characterization of consistency and FIP consistency showing that only
homogeneously exponential functions are consistent.

show a clear narrow red sequence that is co-centered with, and similarly
concentrated on, the extended X-ray emission of the cluster of galaxies
JKCS041. The JKCS041 red sequence is 0.32+/-0.06 mag redder in z'-J than the
red sequence of the zspec=1.62 IRC0218A cluster, putting JKCS041 at z>>1.62 and
ruling out z<~1.49 the latter claimed by a recent paper. The color difference
of the two red sequences gives a red-sequence-based redshift of z=2.20+/-0.11
for JKCS041, where the uncertainty accounts for uncertainties in stellar

sequence color of both JKCS041 and IRC0218A clusters. We do not observe any

5sigma significance in the energy range 200 MeV-20 GeV that is consistent with
originating from M31. The integral photon flux above 100MeV amounts to 9.1 +/-
1.9 (stat) +/- 1.0 (sys) x10e-9 ph/cm2/s. We find no evidence for emission from
M33 and derive an upper limit on the photon flux >100MeV of 5.1 x10e-9 ph/cm2/s

gamma-ray luminosity that also holds for the starburst galaxies. The gamma-ray
luminosity of M31 is about half that of the Milky Way, which implies that the
ratio between the average CR densities in M31 and the Milky Way amounts to 0.35

utilizes an entangled photon pair in a Bell singlet state, and is certified
explicitly by value indefiniteness. While ""true randomness"" is a mathematical
impossibility, the certification by value indefiniteness ensures the quantum
random bits are incomputable in the strongest sense. This is the first QRNG
setup in which a physical principle (Kochen-Specker value indefiniteness)
guarantees that no single quantum bit produced can be classically computed
(reproduced and validated), the mathematical form of bitwise physical
unpredictability. The effects of various experimental imperfections are
discussed in detail, particularly those related to detector efficiencies,
context alignment and temporal correlations between bits. The analysis is to a
large extent relevant for the construction of any QRNG based on beam-splitters.
By measuring the two entangled photons in maximally misaligned contexts and
utilizing the fact that two rather than one bitstring are obtained, more
efficient and robust unbiasing techniques can be applied. A robust and
efficient procedure based on XORing the bitstrings together---essentially using
one as a one-time-pad for the other---is proposed to extract random bits in the
presence of experimental imperfections, as well as a more efficient
modification of the von Neumann procedure for the same task. Some open problems
are also discussed.

effect. For SiO v=0, we have detected 28SiO, 29SiO, and 30SiO; in addition, we
have mapped the J = 5-4 SiO line. For SiS, we have detected the main species,
29SiS, and SiS v=1. Unlikely other species detected in Orion KL (IRc2), the
emission peak of SiS appears at a velocity of ~15.5 km s-1; a study of the 5-4
SiO line around IRc2 shows this feature as an extended component that probably
arises from the interaction of the outflow with the ambient cloud. We derive a
SiO/SiS column density ratio of ~13 in the plateau component. Besides, we
provide upper limits to the column density of several non-detected
Silicon-bearing species. The results of our chemical models show that while it
is possible to reproduce SiO in the gas phase (as well as on the grains), SiS
is a product of surface reactions, most likely involving direct reactions of S
with Si.

luminous objects. The importance of ultra-violet luminosity (over AGN type) in
the detection of 21-cm is further supported by the non-detections in the two
high redshift z ~ 3.6 - 3.8 radio galaxies, which are both type-2 objects,
while having L > 10^23 W/Hz. Our 21-cm detections in combination with those

SCOZA predicts a finite value for the second virial coefficient at the critical
temperature B2(Tc), and whether this theory can lead to an improvement of the
approximate Percus-Yevick solution of the sticky hard-sphere (SHS) model due to
Baxter [R. J. Baxter, J. Chem. Phys. 49, 2770 (1968)]. For SW of non vanishing
delta, the difficulties due to the influence of the boundary condition at high
density already encountered in an earlier investigation [E. Schoell-Paschinger,
A. L. Benavides, and R. Castaneda-Priego, J. Chem. Phys. 123, 234513 (2005)]
prevented us from obtaining reliable results for delta < 0.1. In the sticky
limit this difficulty can be circumvented, but then the SCOZA fails to predict
a liquid-vapor transition. The picture that emerges from this study is that for
delta --> 0, the SCOZA does not fulfill the expected prediction of a constant
B2(Tc) [M. G. Noro and D. Frenkel, J. Chem. Phys. 113, 2941 (2000)], and that
for thermodynamic consistency to be usefully exploited in this regime, one
should probably go beyond the Ornstein-Zernike ansatz.

detectable in relatively low S/N data. We searched for eclipses and transit

limits to the frequency of such systems. While we can only place weak limits on
the likely frequency of Earth-sized or smaller companions; brown dwarfs and gas
giants (radius$\simeq$ R$_{jup}$) with periods $\leq$0.2 days must certainly be
rare ($<10\%$). More stringent constraints requires significantly larger white

duration of eclipses and transits of white dwarfs compared to the cadence of

solve some problems which are intractable on a classical computer implementing
binary logic. Several algorithms have been proposed to utilize the quantum
nature of physical states and solve important problems. For example, Shor's
quantum algorithm is extremely important in the field of cryptography since it
factors large numbers exponentially faster than any known classical algorithm.
Another celebrated example is the Grovers quantum algorithm. These algorithms
can only be implemented on a quantum computer which operates on quantum bits
(qubits). Rudimentary implementations of quantum processor have already been
achieved through linear optical components, ion traps, NMR etc. However
demonstration of a solid state quantum processor had been elusive till DiCarlo
et al demonstrated two qubit algorithms in superconducting quantum processor.
Though this has been a significant step, scalable semiconductor based room
temperature quantum computing is yet to be found. Such a technology could
benefit from the vast experience of the semiconductor industry. Hence, here we
present a reconfigurable semiconductor quantum logic device (SQuaLD) which
operates on the position and spin degree of freedom of the electrons in the
device. Based on a few recent experiments, we believe SQuaLD is experimentally
feasible. Moreover, using a well known quantum simulation method, we show that
quantum algorithms (such as Deutsch Jozsa, Grover search) as well as universal
classical logic operations (such as NAND gate) can be implemented in SQuaLD.
Thus, we argue that SQuaLD is a strong candidate for the future quantum logic
processor since it also satisfies the DiVincenzo criteria for quantum logic
application as well as the five essential characteristics for classical logic
applications.

large gap, respectively. The corresponding variations for single-gap spectra
are 2{\Delta}/kTc = 2.6{\pm}6.4. The relatively large size of crystallites (no
less than ~25 \mu{m}) and the large number of contacts measured (several tens)
suggest with a high degree of probability that the spectra obtained account

be synergically complementary: Trough numerical simulations we impose on a
recent scheme for B-cell interactions, that part of self-reactive lymphocytes
are killed during the ontogenesis by which two observations stem: At first the
so built system is able to show anergy with respect to the previously
encountered self even in its mature life, then this naturally leads to an
increasing variance (and average) in the connectivity distribution of the

this shift may contribute to push to anergy those self-directed cells which are
free to explore the body: identifying the latter as the highly connected ones,
anergy is imposed even via the B-network regulation, and its strength is
influenced by the negative selection.

infall starting at infinity with no initial velocity. We compute the radiated
waveforms, spectra and energies for multipoles up to l = 6, improving
significantly on the numerical accuracy of existing results. This is done by
integrating the Zerilli equation in the frequency domain using the Green's

The numerical accuracy allows us to recover the frequencies of these modes

the quasi-normal modes we reach a \sim 10^{-4} to \sim 10^{-2} accuracy for the
first two overtones of each multipole. Our numerical accuracy also allows us to
display the power-law tail that the wave develops after the ring-down has been
exponentially cut-off. The amplitude of this contribution is \sim 10^2 to \sim
10^3 times smaller than the typical scale of the wave.

magnetic field which guides the higher current fast electron beam generated by
the second pulse. The effects of intensity ratio, delay, total energy and
intrinsic pre-pulse are examined. Thermal and K{\alpha} imaging showed reduced
emission size, increased peak emission and increased total emission at delays
of 4 - 6 ps, an intensity ratio of 10 : 1 (second:first) and a total energy of
186 J. In comparison to a single, high contrast shot, the inferred fast
electron divergence is reduced by 2.7 times, while the fast electron current
density is increased by a factor of 1.8. The enhancements are reproduced with
modelling and are shown to be due to the self-generation of magnetic fields.

class C if there is a language in C which agrees with L on arbitrarily large
polynomial stretches of input lengths. There is a significant separation of L
from C if there is no robust simulation of L in C. The new notion of simulation
is a cleaner and more natural notion of simulation than the infinitely-often
notion. We show that various implications in complexity theory such as the
collapse of PH if NP = P and the Karp-Lipton theorem have analogues for robust
simulations. We then use these results to prove that most known separations in
complexity theory, such as hierarchy theorems, fixed polynomial circuit lower
bounds, time-space tradeoffs, and the theorems of Allender and Williams, can be
strengthened to significant separations, though in each case, an almost

exceeds the interstellar polarization in that direction. Our analysis shows
that the freshly-formed dust around SN 2004dj can be modeled assuming a nearly
spherical shell containing amorphous carbon grains, cooling from ~700 K to ~400
K between +267 and +1246 days. Persistent excess flux has been found above 10
um, which is explained by a cold (~115 K) dust component. If this cold dust is
of circumstellar origin, it is likely to be condensed in a cool, dense shell
between the forward and reverse shocks. Pre-existing circumstellar dust is less
likely, but cannot be ruled out. An upper limit of ~8x10^{-4} M_sun was derived
for the dust mass, which is similar to previously published values for other
dust-producing SNe.

physics. They are driven out of equilibrium by a control, and the question is
naturally posed how such a control can be optimized. We show that optimization
problems in small system thermodynamics are solved by (deterministic) optimal
transport, for which very efficient numerical methods have been developed, and
of which there are applications in Cosmology, fluid mechanics, logistics, and
many other fields. We show, in particular, that minimizing expected heat

solved by Burgers equation of Cosmology and mass transport by the Burgers
velocity field. Our contribution hence considerably extends the range of
solvable optimization problems in small system thermodynamics.

the probability that Brownian motion started inside a wedge does not hit this
wedge. Other key ingredients are the time inversion property of Brownian motion
and the time reversal property of diffusion bridges. Secondly, this methodology
can also be applied for the three dimensional Bessel process. Thirdly, we
consider Bessel bridges from 0 to 0 with dimension parameter $\delta>0$ and
show that the probability that such a Bessel bridge crosses an affine boundary
is equal to the probability that this Bessel bridge stays below some fixed

numbers and once the original star collapses to a white dwarf or a neutron
star, these WIMPs might self-gravitate and eventually collapse forming a
mini-black hole that eventually destroys the star. We impose constraints
competitive to direct dark matter search experiments, for WIMPs with masses
down to the TeV scale.

income distribution curves versus the population of a country systematically.
By using the generalized Lotka-Volterra model to fit the empirical income data
in the United States during 1996-2007, we found an important parameter
$\lambda$ can scale with a $\beta$ power of the size (population) of U.S. in
that year. We pointed out that the size-dependency of the income distributions,
which is a very important property but seldom addressed by previous studies,
has two non-trivial implications: (1) the allometric growth pattern, i.e. the
power law relationship between population and GDP in different years, which can
be mathematically derived from the size-dependent income distributions and also
supported by the empirical data; (2) the connection with the anomalous scaling
for the probability density function in critical phenomena since the re-scaled
form of the income distributions has the exactly same mathematical expression
for the limit distribution of the sum of many correlated random variables
asymptotically.

establishing Quantum Chromodynamics [QCD] as the theory of the strong
interactions within the Standard Model of particle physics. The jets, narrowly
collimated bundles of hadrons, reflect configurations of quarks and gluons at
short distances. Thus, by analysing energy and angular distributions of the
jets experimentally, the properties of the basic constituents of matter and the
strong forces acting between them can be explored. In this review, which is
primarily a description of the discovery of the quark and gluon jets and the
impact of their observation on Quantum Chromodynamics, we elaborate, in
particular, the role of the gluons as the carriers of the strong force.
Focusing on these basic points, jets in $e^+ e^-$ collisions will be in the
foreground of the discussion and we will concentrate on the theory that was
contemporary with the relevant experiments at the electron-positron colliders.
In addition we will delineate the role of jets as tools for exploring other
particle aspects in $ep$ and $pp/p\bar{p}$ collisions - quark and gluon
densities in protons, measurements of the QCD coupling, fundamental 2-2
quark/gluon scattering processes, but also the impact of jet decays of top
quarks, and $W^\pm, Z$ bosons on the electroweak sector. The presentation to a
large extent is formulated in a non-technical language with the intent to
recall the significant steps historically and convey the significance of this
field also to communities beyond high energy physics.

class of molecules in which the electronic state of the graphene-like
hydrocarbon part is tuned by the functional group. Searching for new types of
donor and acceptor molecules, a set of new PAHs has recently been investigated
experimentally using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). In this
work, the electronic structure of the PAHs is studied numerically with the help
of B3LYP hybrid density functionals. Using the DELTA-SCF method, electron
binding energies have been determined which affirm, specify and complement the
UPS data. Symmetry properties of molecular orbitals are analyzed for a
categorization and an estimate of the related signal strength. While SIGMA-like
orbitals are difficult to detect in UPS spectra of condensed film, calculation
provides a detailed insight into the hidden parts of the electronic structure
of donor and acceptor molecules. In addition, a diffuse basis set (6-311++G**)
was used to calculate electron affinity and LUMO eigenvalues. The calculated
electron affinity (EA) provides a classification of the donor/acceptor
properties of the studied molecules. Coronene-hexaone shows a high EA,
comparable to TCNQ, which is a well-known classical acceptor. Calculated
HOMO-LUMO gaps using the related eigenvalues have a good agreement with the
experimental lowest excitation energies. TD-DFT also accurately predicts the
measured optical gap.

of energy. And thus, the sound speed in a continuous medium,
$c_s=\sqrt{dp/d\rho}$, must be subluminal. However, if one would conceive of a
{\em homogeneous} fluid, one would have $c_s=\infty$ unless pressure too would
be homogeneous. Thus it is universally accepted that the maiden GR interior
solution obtained by Schwarzschild, involving a homogeneous fluid having a
boundary, is unphysical. However no one has ever shown how this exact solution
is in reality devoid of physical reality. Also, this solution is universally
used for approximate modelling of general relativistic stars and compact
objects. But here first we show that in order that the Kretschmann scalar is
continuous, one should have $\rho=0$ for strictly homogeneous static stars.
Further, by invoking the fact that in GR, given one time label $t$ one can
choose another time label $t_*=f(t)$ {\em without any loss of generality}, we
obtain the same result that for a static homogeneous sphere $\rho=0$.
Consequently, it is eventually found that the static homogeneous sphere having
a boundary is just part of the vacuum where $c_s=0$ rather than $\infty$.
Therefore all general relativistic stars must be inhomogeneous.
