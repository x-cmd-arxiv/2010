Instead of
considering only one candidate for dark energy, we have considered interaction
between phantom field and modified Chaplygin gas. It has been shown that the
potential of the phantom field increases from a lower value with evolution of
the Universe. It has been observed that, the field has an increasing tendency
and potential has also an increasing tendency with passage of cosmic time. In
the evolution of the universe the crossing of $w=-1$ has been realized by this
interacting model.

substantially from its one-real-photon limit F(Q_1^2,0) even for rather small
values of Q_2^2 (approx 0.1 GeV^2), which cannot be excluded in experiments

theoretical calculations, which usually assume Q_2^2=0, may be untrustworthy.
Our phenomenological model of the pi^0 transition form factor is based on the
vector-meson-dominance hypothesis and all its parameters are fixed by using the
experimental data on the decays of vector mesons. The model soundness is
checked in the two-real-photon limit, where it provides a good parameter-free
description of the pi^0 -> 2 gamma decay rate, and in the pi^0 Dalitz decay.
The dependence of F(Q_1^2,Q_2^2) on Q_1^2 at several fixed values of Q_2^2 is

Higher hole doping leads to a decay of spin-state polarons in favor of
larger-scale magnetic clusters, due to competing ferromagnetic correlations of

evidence for two regimes of magneto-electronic phase separation in this system:
(i) x<0.05, dominated by ferromagnetic intrapolaron interactions, and (ii)

(IIT) has been introduced recently for the study of the emergence of

generation of information by the brain surpassing the information which the
brain's constituents already generate independently of one another. IIT is not
fully plausible in its modeling assumptions, nor is it testable due to severe
combinatorial growth embedded in its key definitions. Here we introduce an
alternative to IIT which, while inspired in similar information-theoretic
principles, seeks to address some of IIT's shortcomings to some extent. Our
alternative framework uses the same network-algorithmic cortical model we
introduced earlier [A. Nathan and V. C. Barbosa, Phys. Rev. E 81, 021916

the well-known notions of information gain and total correlation applied to a
set of variables representing the reachability of neurons by messages in the
model's dynamics. We argue that these two quantities relate to each other in
such a way that can be used to quantify the system's efficiency in generating
information beyond that which does not depend on integration, and give
computational results on our cortical model and on variants thereof that are
either structurally random in the sense of an Erdos-Renyi random directed graph

domain-wall motion when there is no dissipation. If magnetic damping and
dissipative torques are included, the Walker ansatz remains robust when the

proportional to the ratio between the dissipative-torque and the magnetization

geostrophic model, with vertical hydrostatic balance and horizontal Rayleigh
friction, coupled to the heat diffusion and transport, is mathematically
ill-posed. This is because the no-normal flow physical boundary condition
implicitly produces an additional boundary condition for the temperature at the
literal boundary. This additional boundary condition is different, because of
the Coriolis forcing term, than the no heat flux physical boundary condition.
Consequently, the second order parabolic heat equation is over determined with
two different boundary conditions. In a previous work we proposed one remedy to
this problem by introducing a fourth-order artificial hyper-diffusion to the
heat transport equation and proved global regularity for the proposed model.
Another remedy for this problem was suggested by R. Salmon by introducing an
additional Rayleigh-like friction term for the vertical component of the
velocity in the hydrostatic balance equation. In this paper we prove the
global, for all time and all initial data, well-posedness of strong solutions
to the three-dimensional Salmon's planetary geostrophic model of ocean
dynamics. That is, we show global existence, uniqueness and continuous
dependence of the strong solutions on initial data for this model.

problems in planetary nebula (PN) research. Several mechanisms have been
proposed, most of which require a binary companion. However, direct evidence
for a binary companion is lacking in most PNs. We have addressed this problem
by obtaining precise radial velocities of seven bright proto-planetary nebulae
(PPNs), objects in transition from the asymptotic giant branch to the PN phases
of stellar evolution. These have F-G spectral types and have the advantage over
PNs of having more and sharper spectral lines, leading to better precision. Our
observations were made in two observing intervals, 1991-1995 and 2007-2010, and
we have included in our analysis some additional published and unpublished
data. Only one of the PPNs, IRAS 22272+5435, shows a long-term variation that
might tentatively be attributed to a binary companion, with P $>$ 22 years, and
from this, limiting binary parameters are calculated. Selection effects are
also discussed. These results set significant restrictions on the range of
possible physical and orbital properties of any binary companions: they have
periods greater than 25 years or masses of brown dwarfs or super-Jupiters.
While not ruling out the binary hypothesis, it seems fair to say that these
results do not support it.

  Surprisingly, our tractability criterion is simpler than the previous

weighted and, respectively, non-weighted common geometric graphs drawn on n
points in the plane in general position (with no three points collinear):
perfect matchings, spanning trees, spanning cycles (tours), and triangulations.
  (i) We present a new lower bound construction for the maximum number of
triangulations a set of n points in general position can have. In particular,
we show that a generalized double chain formed by two almost convex chains
admits {\Omega}(8.65^n) different triangulations. This improves the bound
{\Omega}(8.48^n) achieved by the double zig-zag chain configuration studied by
Aichholzer et al.
  (ii) We present a new lower bound of {\Omega}(12.00^n) for the number of
non-crossing spanning trees of the double chain composed of two convex chains.
The previous bound, {\Omega}(10.42^n), stood unchanged for more than 10 years.
  (iii) Using a recent upper bound of 30^n for the number of triangulations,
due to Sharir and Sheffer, we show that n points in the plane in general
position admit at most O(68.62^n) non-crossing spanning cycles.
  (iv) We derive lower bounds for the number of maximum and minimum weighted
geometric graphs (matchings, spanning trees, and tours). We show that the
number of shortest non-crossing tours can be exponential in n. Likewise, we
show that both the number of longest non-crossing tours and the number of
longest non-crossing perfect matchings can be exponential in n. Moreover, we
show that there are sets of n points in convex position with an exponential
number of longest non-crossing spanning trees. For points in convex position we
obtain tight bounds for the number of longest and shortest tours. We give a
combinatorial characterization of the longest tours, which leads to an O(nlog

binaries. There is significant evidence for miscellaneous physical processes
between interacting binary components manifesting themselves by period and
light curve changes. Aims. Obtaining new set of photometric and spectroscopic
observations, we analysed them together with the older spectroscopic and
photometric data to build model of this eclipsing system with respect to
observed changes of O-C diagram and light curve. Methods. Reduction of new
spectra was carried out in the IRAF and SPEFO programs. Radial velocities were
determined manually using SPEFO, by CCF using the Zverko's code and from the
program KOREL. Orbital elements were derived with the FOTEL program and via
disentangling with KOREL. The final combined solution was obtained with the
programs PHOEBE and FOTEL. Results. Photometry shows small irregularities in
light curves as a results of pulsating of one component and spot activity.
Using net of KOREL outputs we found the mass ratio q=0.405(3).We confirm the
presence of stellar matter around the primary. Even after subtraction of ADS
9706B influence, light curve solutions show third light in the system. Models
in FOTEL and Phoebe are presented. Conclusions. TW Dra is an astrophysically
very interesting eclipsing binary. Future combination of interferometry,
spectroscopy, and photometry is promising. It could definitely confirm the
hypothesis of quadruple system for TW Dra and explain behaviour of this system

the yield of planetary images and spectra from a follow-on direct detection
mission. This approach is based on the notion-strictly hypothetical-that if a
particular star could be observed continuously, the instrument would in time
observe all portions of the habitable zone so that no planet residing therein
could be missed. This strategy could not be implemented in any realistic
mission scenario. But if an exoplanet's orbit is known from astrometric
observation, then it may be possible to plan and schedule a sequence of imaging
observations that is the equivalent of continuous observation. A series of
images-optimally spaced in time-could be recorded to examine contiguous
segments of the orbit. In time, all segments would be examined, leading to the
inevitable detection of the planet. In this paper, we show how astrometric
orbit information can be used to construct such a sequence. Using stars from
astrometric and imaging target lists, we find that the number of observations
in this sequence typically ranges from 2 to 7, representing the maximum number
of observations required to find the planet. The probable number of
observations ranges from 1.5 to 3.1. This is a dramatic improvement in
efficiency over previous methods proposed for utilizing astrometric orbits. We
examine how the implementation of this approach is complicated and limited by
operational constraints. We find that it can be fully implemented for internal
coronagraph and visual nuller missions, with a success rate approaching 100%.
External occulter missions will also benefit, but to a lesser degree.

especially in battery- operated systems. Maintaining high performance, while
extending the battery life between charges is an interesting challenge for
system designers. Dynamic Voltage Scaling (DVS) allows a processor to
dynamically change speed and voltage at run time, thereby saving energy by
spreading run cycles into idle time. Knowing when to use full power and when
not, requires the cooperation of the operating system scheduler. Usually,
higher processor voltage and frequency leads to higher system throughput while
energy reduction can be obtained using lower voltage and frequency. Instead of
lowering processor voltage and frequency as much as possible, energy efficient
real-time scheduling adjusts voltage and frequency according to some
optimization criteria, such as low energy consumption or high throughput, while
it meets the timing constraints of the real-time tasks. As the quantity and
functional complexity of battery powered portable devices continues to raise,
energy efficient design of such devices has become increasingly important. Many
real-time scheduling algorithms have been developed recently to reduce energy
consumption in the portable devices that use DVS capable processors. Three
algorithms namely Red Tasks Only (RTO), Blue When Possible (BWP) and Red as
Late as Possible (RLP) are proposed in the literature to schedule the real-time
tasks in Weakly-hard real-time systems. This paper proposes optimal slack
management algorithms to make the above existing weakly hard real-time
scheduling algorithms energy efficient using DVS and DPD techniques.

reflection-less devices. The electromagnetic waves can tunnel from one layer to

  In both cases we show that the process is superdiffusive: the variance grows
faster than linearly with time. We give lower and upper bounds of the order of
t log log t, respectively, t log t. We also present computations for an
anisotropic version of the self-repelling Brownian polymer where we give lower

0104-72.3 in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). The X-ray morphology shows two
prominent lobes along the northwest-southeast direction and a soft faint arc in
the east. Previous low resolution X-ray images attributed the unresolved
emission from the southeastern lobe to a Be/X-ray star. Our high resolution
Chandra data clearly shows that this emission is diffuse, shock-heated plasma,
with negligible X-ray emission from the Be star. The eastern arc is
positionally coincident with a filament seen in optical and infrared
observations. Its X-ray spectrum is well fit by plasma of normal SMC
abundances, suggesting that it is from shocked ambient gas. The X-ray spectra
of the lobes show overabundant Fe, which is interpreted as emission from the
reverse-shocked Fe-rich ejecta. The overall spectral characteristics of the
lobes and the arc are similar to those of Type Ia SNRs, and we propose that SNR
0104-72.3 is the first case for a robust candidate Type Ia SNR in the SMC. On
the other hand, the remnant appears to be interacting with dense clouds toward
the east and to be associated with a nearby star-forming region. These features
are unusual for a standard Type Ia SNR. Our results suggest an intriguing

solar cycle and activity phenomena, it is understood that sunspots are formed
at different depths by superposition of Alfven wave perturbations of a strong
toroidal field structure in the convective envelope and after attaining a
critical strength, due to buoyancy, raise toward the surface along the
rotational isocontours that have positive (0.7-0.935 $R_{\odot}$) and negative
(0.935-1.0 $R_{\odot}$) rotational gradients. Owing to physical conditions in
these two rotational gradients, from the equation of magnetic induction,
sunspot's area growth and decay problem is solved separately. It is found that
rate of growth of sunspot's area during its evolution at different depths is
function of steady and fluctuating parts of Lorentzian force of the ambient
medium, fluctuations in meridional flow velocity, radial variation of
rotational gradient and $cot(\vartheta)$ (where $\vartheta$ is co-latitude).
While rate of decay of sunspot's area at different depths during its evolution
mainly depends upon magnetic diffusivity, rotational gradient and
$sin^{2}(\vartheta)$. Gist of this study is that growth and decay of area of
the sunspot mainly depends upon whether sunspot is originated in the region of
either positive or negative rotational gradient. For different latitudes and
life spans of the sunspots on the surface during their evolutionary history,
both the analytically derived theoretical area growth and decay curves match
reasonably well with the observed area growth and decay curves.

ambipolar diffusion to study the gravitationally-driven fragmentation of
subcritical molecular clouds, in which the gravitational fragmentation is
stabilized as long as magnetic flux-freezing applies. The simulations show that
the cores in an initially subcritical cloud generally develop gradually over an
ambipolar diffusion time, which is about a few $\times 10^7$ years in a typical
molecular cloud. On the other hand, the formation of collapsing cores in
subcritical clouds is accelerated by supersonic nonlinear flows. Our parameter
study demonstrates that core formation occurs faster as the strength of the
initial flow speed in the cloud increases. We found that the core formation
time is roughly proportional to the inverse of the square root of the enhanced
density created by the supersonic nonlinear flows. The density dependence is
similar to that derived in quasistatically contracting magnetically supported
clouds, although the core formation conditions are created by the nonlinear
flows in our simulations. We have also found that the accelerated formation
time is not strongly dependent on the initial strength of the magnetic field if
the cloud is highly subcritical. Our simulation shows that the core formation
time in our model subcritical clouds is several $\times 10^6$ years, due to the
presence of large-scale supersonic flows ($\sim 3$ times sound speed). Once a
collapsing core forms, the density, velocity, and magnetic field structure of
the core does not strongly depend on the initial strength of the velocity
fluctuation. The infall velocities of the cores are subsonic and the magnetic
field lines show weak hourglass shapes.

regardless of overlaps with the model space and energy differences between
unperturbed energies and the eigenvalues of H. We find also that Z(E) is a

confirm the weak nature of electron correlation in rutile $TiO_2$ and shows
that the $U$-dependence of the energy gap in perfect bulk is slightly stronger
than in defected sample. In addition, we studied the $U$- dependency of $V_O$
defect states and found that different charged vacancies shows different
$U$-dependence . While the application of $G_0W_0$ correction would improve the
quasiparticle gap and formation energies, however the $V_O$ states, in contrast
to experiment, remains entangled with the conduction band. Finally, we used
PBE0 and HSE06 hybrid functionals and found that these exchange-correlation

description of the screening, properly disentangle the neutral and singly
ionized $V_O$ from the conduction band . According to hybrid functional
calculations, all vacancies are stabilized and $V_O$ with 2+ charge state is
the most stable vacancy in the whole Fermi-level range inside the gap and hence
$V_O$ acts as a shallow donor.

the anomalous modular behaviors of the discrete (BPS) characters are
compensated by the transformation law of the non-holomorphic coefficients of

non-holomorphic continuous characters combine into real analytic Jacobi forms

to solar wind activity using a particles-in-cell model [Baraka and Ben Jaffel,
2007], but here during northward IMF. The formation of the magnetospheric
cavity and its elongation is obtained with the classical structure of a
magnetosphere with parallel lobes. An impulsive disturbance is then applied to
the system by changing the bulk velocity of the solar wind to simulate a
decrease in the solar wind dynamic pressure followed by its recovery. In
response to the imposed disturbance, a gap [abrupt depression] in the incoming
solar wind plasma appears moving toward the Earth. The gap's size is a ~15 RE
and is comparable to the sizes previously obtained for both Bz<0 and Bz =0.
During the initial phase of the disturbance, the dayside magnetopause (MP)
expands slower than the previous cases of IMF orientations as a result of the
depression. The size of the MP expands nonlinearly due to strengthening of its
outer boundary by the northward IMF. Also, during the initial 100 {\Delta}t,
the MP shrank down from 13.3 RE to ~9.2 RE before it started expanding; a
phenomenon that was also observed for southern IMF conditions but not during
the no IMF case. As soon as they felt the solar wind depression, cusps widened
at high altitude while dragged in an upright position. For the field's
topology, the reconnection between magnetospheric and magnetosheath fields is
clearly observed in both northward and southward cusps areas. Also, the tail
region in the northward IMF condition is more confined, in contrast to the
fishtail-shape obtained in the southward IMF case. An X-point is formed in the
tail at ~110 RE compared to ~103 RE and ~80 RE for Bz =0 and Bz <0
respectively. Our findings are consistent with existing reports from many space
observatories for which predictions are proposed to test furthermore our

definition of a concept provides obvious cases of its instantiation from which
more refined or liberal definitions may be derived.
  A definition of outsourcing induces to a complementary definition of
insourcing. Outsourcing and insourcing have more complex variations in which
multiple parties are involved. All of these terms both refer to state
transformations and to state descriptions pertaining to the state obtained
after such transformations. We make an attempt to disambiguate the terminology
in that respect and we make an attempt to characterize the general concept of
sourcing which captures some representative cases.
  Because mereology is the most general theory of parthood relations we coin
business mereology as the general theory in business studies which concerns the

ellipticity, position angle, semi-major axis corresponding to the ellipticity
maximum in the bar region, and length, are also reported; deprojection has been
applied to the bar ellipticity, length, and relative length in terms of galaxy
isophotal semi-major axis. Regarding bar length estimation, we use a method,
based on the relation between the behaviour of the profiles and orbit analysis.
The so estimated bar length tightly correlates with the semi-major axis,
corresponding to the ellipticity maximum with a median ratio of the former to
the latter of 1.22. The median of the deprojected bar ellipticity, length, and
relative length are 0.39, 5.44 kpc, and 0.44, respectively. There is a

strong, based on the deprojected bar ellipticity as a first-order approximation

information about MSM's risk behavior statistically, psychologically and
sociologically. Despite the era of potent antiretroviral therapy, the incidence
of HIV among MSM increases. In the long term the contradictory effects of risk
behavior and effective therapy are still poorly understood. Using a previously
presented Complex Agent Network model, we describe steady and casual
partnerships to predict the HIV spreading among MSM. Behavior-related
parameters and values, inferred from studies on Amsterdam MSM, are fed into the
model; we validate the model using historical yearly incidence data.
Subsequently, we study scenarios to assess the contradictory effects of risk
behavior and effective therapy, by varying corresponding values of parameters.
Finally, we conduct quantitative analysis based on the resulting incidence
data. The simulated incidence reproduces the ACS historical incidence well and
helps to predict the HIV epidemic among MSM in Amsterdam. Our results show that
in the long run the positive influence of effective therapy can be outweighed
by an increase in risk behavior of at least 30% for MSM. Conclusion: We
recommend, based on the model predictions, that lowering risk behavior is the
prominent control mechanism of HIV incidence even in the presence of effective
therapy.

attributes is employed to produce effort estimations of the expected human
resources to deliver a software product. However, choosing the appropriate
project cost drivers in each case requires a lot of experience and knowledge on
behalf of the project manager which can only be obtained through years of
software engineering practice. A number of studies indicate that popular
methods applied in the literature for software cost estimation, such as linear
regression, are not robust enough and do not yield accurate predictions.
Recently the dual variables Ridge Regression (RR) technique has been used for
effort estimation yielding promising results. In this work we show that results
may be further improved if an AI method is used to automatically select
appropriate project cost drivers (inputs) for the technique. We propose a
hybrid approach combining RR with a Genetic Algorithm, the latter evolving the
subset of attributes for approximating effort more accurately. The proposed
hybrid cost model has been applied on a widely known high-dimensional dataset

galaxies were derived using the GASP2D algorithm and then analyzed to derive
the intrinsic shape of their bulges. We developed a new method to derive the
intrinsic shape of bulges based on photometric data and on the geometrical
relationships between the apparent and intrinsic shapes of bulges and disks.
The method is conceived as completely independent of the studied class of
objects, and it can be applied whenever a triaxial ellipsoid embedded in an
axisymmetric component is considered. We found that the intrinsic shape is well
constrained for a subsample of 115 bulges with favorable viewing angles. A
large fraction of them is characterized by an elliptical section (B/A<0.9).
This fraction is 33%, 55%, and 43% if using their maximum, mean, or median
equatorial ellipticity, respectively. Most of them are flattened along their
polar axis. The distribution of triaxiality is strongly bimodal. This
bimodality is driven by bulges with Sersic index n>2, or equivalently, by the
bulges of galaxies with a bulge-to-total ratio B/T>0.3. Bulges with n<2 and
with B/T<0.3 follow a similar distribution, which is different from that of
bulges with n>2 and with B/T>0.3. In particular, bulges with n<2 and with
B/T<0.3 show a larger fraction of oblate axisymmetric (or nearly axisymmetric)
bulges, a smaller fraction of triaxial bulges, and fewer prolate axisymmetric
(or nearly axisymmetric) bulges with respect to bulges with n>2 and with

formation, bulges with n<2, which show a high fraction of oblate axisymmetric

dissipational minor mergers. Both major dissipational and dissipationless
mergers seem to be required to explain the variety of shapes found for bulges

demonstrate a possible way of proving that all known fundamental forces in the
nature are the manifestations of the single, unique interaction. We re-define
the gauging of integration constants in the Schwarzschild solution of Einstein
field equations. We consider the potential energy in this context regardless it
is gravitational or electric potential energy. With the newly gauged constants,
we sketch how the unique interaction can be described with the help of an
appropriate solution of the well-known Maxwell equations. According the
solution, there are two zones, in the system of two oppositely charged
particles, where the force is oscillating. The first particle can be in a
stable, constant distance from the second particle, between the neighbouring
regions of repulsion and attraction. In an outer oscillation zone, the
corresponding energy levels in the proton-electron systems are identical (on
the level of accuracy of values calculated by the Dirac's equations) to some
experimentally determined levels in the hydrogen atom. For each system of two
particles, there is also the zone with the macroscopic, i.e. monotonous
behavior of the force. As well, the solution can be used to demonstrate that
the net force between two assemblies consisting each (or at least one) of the
same numbers of both positively and negatively charged particles is never zero.
A secondary electric force, having the same orientation as the primary electric
force between the oppositely charged particles, is always present. It can be
identified to the gravity. Finally, the solution of the Maxwell equations can
be used to calculate the inertia force of a particle. The consistent formulas
for both acting and inertia forces enable to construct the dimensionless
(without gravitational constant, permitivity of vacuum, etc.) equation of
motion.

24.0 mag in the SDSS r filter. Most of candidate diameters were estimated to be
smaller than 1 km. We found a scarcity of sub-km MBAs with high inclination.
Cumulative size distributions (CSDs) were constructed using Subaru data and

a shallower CSD. We also found that the CSD of S-like MBAs had a small slope
with high inclination, whereas the slope did not vary with inclination in the
C-like group. The most probable cause of the shallow CSD of the

methanol masers and Submillimeter Array observations of the 229 GHz methanol
masers in DR21(OH), DR21N, and DR21W. The distribution of 36 GHz masers in the
outflow of DR21(OH) is similar to that of the other class I methanol
transitions, with numerous multitransition spatial overlaps. At the site of the
main continuum source in DR21(OH), class I masers at 36 and 229 GHz are found
in virtual overlap with class II 6.7 GHz masers. To the south of the outflow,
the 36 GHz masers are scattered over a large region but usually do not appear
coincident with 44 GHz masers. In DR21W we detect an ""S-curve"" signature in
Stokes V that implies a large value of the magnetic field strength if
interpreted as due to Zeeman splitting, suggesting either that class I masers
may exist at higher densities than previously believed or that the direct
Zeeman interpretation of S-curve Stokes V profiles in class I masers may be
incorrect. We find a diverse variety of different maser phenomena in these
sources, suggestive of differing physical conditions among them.

  replay","3 pages",,,,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In a recent note (arXiv:1012.5069), the investigation performed by the
present authors on the evolution of density fluctuations in an accelerated
universe including matter creation was criticized. The criticism is based on
the fact that the Newtonian background is not ""accelerating"", invalidating the
conclusions of the linear analysis. We show that our linear equations describe
adequately an accelerating universe in which the pressure associated to the
creation process is constant, a model equivalent to the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology.
Thus, our previous conclusions remain unchanged.

  grassmannian","106 pages. Author's doctoral dissertation (this version with section
  and equation numbers matching the published version)","Represent. Theory 16 (2012), 345-449",,,"math.RT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We prove a generalization of the twisted geometric Satake equivalence of
Finkelberg--Lysenko in the context of the factorizable grassmannian of a
reductive group G relative to a smooth curve X, similar to Gaitsgory's
generalization in ""On de Jong's conjecture"" of the Satake equivalence itself.
In order to express the dependence of this result on factorizability, we
consider a certain 2-category of gerbes on this grassmannian, which we call ""sf
gerbes""; the theorem then concerns perverse sheaves twisted by such gerbes.
This notion of twisting differs from, but in special cases is equivalent to,
that considered by Finkelberg--Lysenko. We give a classification of these
gerbes in terms of quadratic forms on the coweight lattice of G and gerbes on
X. In addition, we introduce the technical device of universal local acyclicity
(ULA) into the proof of the Satake equivalence, using it in combination with
Beilinson's nearby cycles gluing of perverse sheaves to reduce all of the main
constructions in the Mirkovic--Vilonen proof of the equivalence to the ULA
case, where they have simple descriptions whose properties have simple proofs.
We also give a geometric proof that the category of spherical perverse sheaves
on the ordinary affine grassmannian is semisimple.
