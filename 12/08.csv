initial spurious eccentricity remains a challenge for numerical-relativity
simulations. This problem can be overcome by applying an eccentricity-removal
procedure which consists in evolving the binary for a couple of orbits,
estimating the eccentricity, and then correcting the initial conditions. The
presence of spins can complicate this procedure. As predicted by post-Newtonian
theory, spin-spin interactions and precession prevent the binary from moving
along an adiabatic sequence of spherical orbits, inducing oscillations in the
radial separation and in the orbital frequency. However, spin-induced
oscillations occur at approximately twice the orbital frequency, therefore they
can be distinguished from the initial spurious eccentricity, which occurs at
approximately the orbital frequency. We develop a new removal procedure based
on the derivative of the orbital frequency and find that it is successful in
reducing the eccentricity measured in the orbital frequency to less than 0.0001
when moderate spins are present. We test this new procedure using
numerical-relativity simulations of binary black holes with mass ratios 1.5 and
3, spin magnitude 0.5 and various spin orientations. The numerical simulations
exhibit spin-induced oscillations in the dynamics at approximately twice the
orbital frequency. Oscillations of similar frequency are also visible in the

fingerprint on the intensity variation. In realistic cases, this distortion is
too little to be detected in the individual light curves, and must be
amplified. Averaging the folded light curve of several transits helps decrease
the scatter, but it is not the best approach because it also reduces the
signal. The relative position of the moon varies from transit to transit, the
moon's wing will appear in different positions on different sides of the
planet's transit. Here we show that a careful analysis of the scatter curve of
the folded light curves enhances the chance of detecting the exomoons directly.

flares of small scale, those with prompt X-ray emission classified by GOES as
C-Class (power $10^{-6}$ to $10^{-5}$ W m$^2$ at 1 AU) may give rise to muon
excess probably associated with solar protons and ions emitted by the flare and
arriving at the Earth as a coherent particle pulse. The Tupi telescopes are
within the central region of the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA), which allows
particle detectors to achieve a low rigidity of response to primary and
secondary charged particles ($\geq 0.1$ GV). Here we argue for the possibility
of a ""scale-free"" energy distribution of particles accelerated by solar flares.
Large and small scale flares have the same energy spectrum up to energies
exceeding the pion production, the difference between them is only the
intensity. If this hypothesis is correct, the Tupi telescope is registering
muons produced by protons (ions) whose energy corresponds to the tail of the
spectrum. Consequently the energy distribution of the emitted protons has to be
a power law spectrum, since power law distributions are characterized as scale
free distributions. The Tupi events give support to this conjecture.

the Hamiltonian Mean Field (HMF) model in the framework of Lynden-Bell's
statistical theory of the Vlasov equation. For two-levels initial conditions,
the caloric curve $\beta(E)$ only depends on the initial value $f_0$ of the
distribution function. We evidence different regions in the parameter space
where the nature of phase transitions between magnetized and non-magnetized
states changes: (i) for $f_0>0.10965$, the system displays a second order phase
transition; (ii) for $0.109497<f_0<0.10965$, the system displays a second order
phase transition and a first order phase transition; (iii) for
$0.10947<f_0<0.109497$, the system displays two second order phase transitions;
(iv) for $f_0<0.10947$, there is no phase transition. The passage from a first
order to a second order phase transition corresponds to a tricritical point.
The sudden appearance of two second order phase transitions from nothing
corresponds to a second order azeotropy. This is associated with a phenomenon
of phase reentrance. When metastable states are taken into account, the problem
becomes even richer. In particular, we find a new situation of phase
reentrance. We consider both microcanonical and canonical ensembles and report
the existence of a tiny region of ensembles inequivalence. We also explain why
the use of the initial magnetization $M_0$ as an external parameter, instead of
the phase level $f_0$, may lead to inconsistencies in the thermodynamical
analysis.

to the Einstein frame, we explore the effect of the resulting coupling on the

that the coupling forces the scalar field into the minimum of its effective

energy density during inflation, the dynamics are determined by the DBI field,
which has the interesting effect of increasing the number of efolds of
inflation and decreasing the boost factor of the DBI field. Focusing on this

of the primordial perturbations is determined by the behaviour of the

17P/Holmes during its dramatic outburst of 2007. The observations, from the
orbiting Solar Mass Ejection Imager (SMEI), provide the most complete measure
of the whole-coma brightness, free from the effects of instrumental saturation
and with a time-resolution well-matched to the rapid brightening of the comet.
The lightcurve is divided into two distinct parts. A rapid rise between the
first SMEI observation on UT 2007 October 24 06h 37m (mid-integration) and UT
2007 October 25, is followed by a slow decline until the last SMEI observation
on UT 2008 April 6 22h 16m (mid-integration). We find that the rate of change
of the brightness is reasonably well-described by a Gaussian function having a
central time of UT 2007 October 24.54+/-0.01 and a full-width-at-half-maximum
0.44+/-0.02 days. The maximum rate of brightening occurs some 1.2 days after
the onset of activity. At the peak the scattering cross-section grows at
1070+/-40 km^2/s while the (model-dependent) mass loss rates inferred from the
lightcurve reach a maximum at 3+/-10^5 kg/s. The integrated mass in the coma
lies in the range (2 to 90)x10^10 kg, corresponding to 0.2% to 10% of the
nucleus mass, while the kinetic energy of the ejecta is (0.6 to 30) MTonnes
TNT. The particulate coma mass could be contained within a shell on the nucleus
of thickness ~1.5 to 60 m. This is comparable to the distance traveled by
conducted heat in the century since the previous outburst of 17P/Holmes. This
coincidence is consistent with, but does not prove, the idea that the outburst
was triggered by the action of conducted heat, possibly through the
crystallization of buried amorphous ice.

strong interaction between the qubits and a bus formed by a non-engineered

with qubit separations. Surprisingly, a sudden switching of the coupling is not
necessary and our gate mechanism is not altered by a possibly gradual
switching. The bus is also naturally reset to its initial state making the

above and below the plane and in Q4 above the plane. We confirm the
corresponding kinematic asymmetry first reported by Parker et al. (2004),
extended to greater distances and with more spatial coverage. The Thick Disk
stars in Q1 have a rotational lag of 60 -- 70 km/s relative to circular
rotation, and the Metal-Weak Thick Disk stars have an even greater lag of 100
km/s. Both lag their corresponding populations in Q4 by approximately 30 km/s.
Interestingly, the Disk stars in Q1 also appear to participate in the
rotational lag by about 30 km/s. The enhanced rotational lag for the Thick Disk
in Q1 extends to 4 kpc or more from the Sun. At 3 to 4 kpc, our sight lines
extend above the density contours on the near side of the bar, and as our lines
of sight pass directly over the bar the rotational lag appears to decrease.
This is consistent with a ""gravitational wake"" induced by the rotating bar in
the Disk which would trap and pile up stars behind it. We conclude that a
dynamical interaction with the stellar bar is the most probable explanation for
the observed kinematic and spatial asymmetries.

proper frequency of the mode at the beginning of inflation are well below the
Planck scale, the fractional correction is small. However, modes which are
transplanckian at the onset of inflation can undergo a significant correction.
The increase in amplitude can potentially have observable consequences through
a modification of the power spectrum of tensor perturbations in inflationary
cosmology. This enhancement of the power spectrum depends upon the duration of
inflation and is greater for shorter wavelengths.

functions and flatness functions. The flatness function exponent is a measure
of the degree of intermittency. We found that the flatness function exponent at
scales below approximately 10 Mm is correlated to the flare productivity (the
correlation coefficient is - 0.63). {\it Hinode} data show that the
intermittency regime is extended toward the small scales (below 2 Mm) as
compared to the MDI data. The spectra of multifractality, derived from the
structure functions and flatness functions, are found to be more broad for ARs
of highest flare productivity as compared to that of low flare productivity.
The magnetic structure of high-flaring ARs consists of a voluminous set of
monofractals, and this set is much richer than that for low-flaring ARs. The
results indicate relevance of the multifractal organization of the photospheric
magnetic fields to the flaring activity. Strong intermittency observed in
complex and high-flaring ARs is a hint that we observe a photospheric imprint

Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey, taken from the catalog presented
in Bridge et al. (2010). By analyzing the internal colors of these systems, we
show that so-called wet and dry mergers evolve in different senses, and
quantify the space densities of these systems. The local space density of wet
mergers is essentially dentical to the local space density of dry mergers. The
evolution in the total merger rate is modest out to z ~ 0.7, although the wet
and dry populations have different evolutionary trends. At higher redshifts dry
mergers make a smaller contribution to the total merging galaxy population, but
this is offset by a roughly equivalent increase in the contribution from wet
mergers. By comparing the mass density function of early-type galaxies to the
corresponding mass density function for merging systems, we show that not all
the major mergers with the highest masses (M_stellar > 10^11 M_solar) will end
up with the most massive early-type galaxies, unless the merging timescale is
dramatically longer than that usually assumed. On the other hand, the
usually-assumed merging timescale of ~ 0.5-1 Gyr is quite consistent with the
data if we suppose that only less massive early-type galaxies form via mergers.
Since low-intermediate mass ellipticals are 10 --100 times more common than
their most massive counterparts, the hierarchical explanation for the origin of
early-type galaxies may be correct for the vast majority of early-types, even
if incorrect for the most massive ones.

information on the nature of dark energy. In this work, we study the efficacy
of these different parameters in discriminating theoretical models of dark
energy, using both currently available supernova (SNe) data, and simulations of
future observations. We find that the current data does not put strong
constraints on the nature of dark energy, irrespective of the cosmological
parameter used. For future data, we find that the although deceleration
parameter can accurately reconstruct some dark energy models, it is unable to
discriminate between different models of dark energy, therefore limiting its
usefulness. Physical parameters such as the equation of state of dark energy,
or the dark energy density do a good job of both reconstruction and
discrimination if the matter density is known to high accuracy. However,
uncertainty in matter density reduces the efficacy of these parameters. A
recently proposed parameter, Om(z), constructed from the first derivative of
the SNe data, works very well in discriminating different theoretical models of
dark energy, and has the added advantage of not being dependent on the value of
matter density. Thus we find that a cosmological parameter constructed from the
first derivative of the data, for which the theoretical models of dark energy
are sufficiently distant from each other, and which is independent of the
matter density, performs the best in reconstructing dark energy from SNe data.

environments. Methods: We calculate the nuclear and electronic interactions for
collisions between PAHs and cosmic ray ions and electrons with energies between
5 MeV/nucleon and 10 GeV, above the threshold for carbon atom loss, in normal
galaxies, starburst galaxies and cooling flow galaxy clusters. Results: The
timescale for PAH destruction by cosmic ray ions depends on the electronic
excitation energy Eo and on the amount of energy available for dissociation.
Small PAHs are destroyed faster, with He and the CNO group being the more
effective projectiles. For electron collisions, the lifetime is independent of
the PAH size and varies with the threshold energy To. Conclusions: Cosmic rays
process the PAHs in diffuse clouds, where the destruction due to interstellar
shocks is less efficient. In the hot gas filling galactic halos, outflows of
starburst galaxies and intra-cluster medium, PAH destruction is dominated by
collisions with thermal ions and electrons, but this mechanism is ineffective
if the molecules are in denser cloudlets and isolated from the hot gas. Cosmic
rays can access the denser clouds and together with X-rays will set the
lifetime of those protected PAHs. This limits the use of PAHs as a`dye' for
tracing the presence of cold entrained material.

Black hole masses are then derived from the black hole mass - stellar velocity
dispersion relation. We find BL Lac objects host black holes of similar masses,
~10^{8.5} M_sun, with a dispersion of 0.4 dex, similar to the uncertainties on
each black hole measurement. Therefore, all BL Lac objects in our sample have
the same indistinguishable black hole mass. These 71 BL Lac objects follow the
black hole mass - bulge luminosity relation, and their narrow range of host
galaxy luminosities confirm previous claims that BL Lac host galaxies can be
treated as standard candles. We conclude that the observed diversity in the

black hole mass or host galaxy properties.

important effect on the mass determination of the clusters through X-ray
observations. The corresponding dynamical pressure has to be accounted for in
addition to the hydrostatic pressure support to achieve a precise mass
measurement. An analysis of the velocity structure of the ICM for simulated
cluster-size haloes, especially focusing on rotational patterns, has been
performed, demonstrating them to be an intermittent phenomenon, strongly
related to the internal dynamics of substructures. We find that the expected
build-up of rotation due to mass assembly gets easily destroyed by passages of
gas-rich substructures close to the central region. Though, if a typical
rotation pattern is established, the corresponding mass contribution is
estimated to be up to ~17% of the total mass in the innermost region, and one
has to account for it. Extending the analysis to a larger sample of simulated
haloes we statistically observe that (i) the distribution of the rotational
component of the gas velocity in the innermost region has typical values of
~200-300 km/s; (ii) except for few outliers, there is no monotonic increase of
the rotational velocity with decreasing redshift, as we would expect from
approaching a relaxed configuration. Therefore, the hypothesis that the
build-up of rotation is strongly influenced by internal dynamics is confirmed,
and minor events like gas-rich substructures passing close to the equatorial
plane can easily destroy any ordered rotational pattern.

from restoring modularity of an indefinite theta-function capturing the

the compatibility of this equation with anomaly equations previously observed

intermolecular potential having the form of an inverse power law (IPL),

properties over the relevant range of intermolecular distances. However, the
derivation of the scaling property of an IPL liquid is based on reduced
quantities, for example, the reduced relaxation time equal to T^1/2V^-1/3 times
the actual relaxation time. The difference between scaling using reduced rather
than unreduced units is negligible in the supercooled regime; however, at
higher temperature the difference can be substantial, accounting for the

separate from the flavor branes or dissolves in them and becomes a flavor
instanton. The leading order interaction between the baryons is a competition
between the attraction and the repulsion due to the sigma and omega mesons. The
lightest 0++ particle sigma is a pseudo-Goldstone boson associated with the
spontaneous breaking of scale invariance. In a certain range of parameters it
is parametrically lighter than any other massive state. As a result at large

This may be plausible in scenarios where the mass generation mechanisms of

hypothesis, we assume mass textures which may be generated by the
Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism for the charged lepton and quark sectors, which
generically leads to strong hierarchies, whereas the neutrino sector is exactly
tri-bimaximal with a mild (normal) hierarchy. We find that in this approach,
deviations from maximal atmospheric mixing can be introduced without affecting
theta_13 and theta_12, whereas a deviation of theta_13 or theta_12 from its
tri-bimaximal value will inevitably lead to a similar-sized deviation of the
other parameter. Therefore, the already very precise knowledge of theta_12
points towards small sin^2(2 theta_13) <= 0.01. The magnitude of this deviation
can be controlled by the specific form of the charged lepton texture.

CFT's associated to loop groups, as twisted equivariant K-theory. We build on
their work to express K-theoretically the structures of full CFT. In
particular, the modular invariant partition functions (which essentially
parametrise the possible full CFTs) have a rich interpretation within von
Neumann algebras (subfactors), which has led to the developments of structures
of full CFT such as the full system (fusion ring of defect lines), nimrep
(cylindrical partition function), alpha-induction etc. Modular categorical
interpretations for these have followed. For the generic families of modular
invariants (i.e. those associated to Dynkin diagram symmetries), we provide a
K-theoretic framework for these other CFT structures, and show how they relate
to D-brane charges and charge-groups. We also study conformal embeddings and
the E7 modular invariant of SU(2), as well as some families of finite group
doubles. This new K-theoretic framework allows us to simplify and extend the
less transparent, more ad hoc descriptions of these structures obtained

deadlocks during synchronizations and race conditions brought by concurrency.
Added to the difficulty is the lack of a simple, well-accepted computing model

programming environments and debugging tools. To tackle the challenges, we
promote a generalized stream computing model, inspired by previous researches
on stream computing, that unifies parallelization strategies for programming
language design, compiler design and operating system design. Our model
provides a high-level abstraction in designing language constructs to convey
concepts of concurrent operations, in organizing a program's runtime layout for
parallel execution, and in scheduling concurrent instruction blocks through
runtime and/or operating systems. In this paper, we give a high-level
description of the proposed model: we define the foundation of the model, show
its simplicity through algebraic/computational operation analysis, illustrate a
programming framework enabled by the model, and demonstrate its potential
through powerful design options for programming languages, compilers and

obtained only by measurement or by numerical solution of a boundary-value
problem. In numerical charged-particle map generation, fields along a reference
trajectory are differentiated multiple times. Any attempt to differentiate
directly such field data multiple times is soon dominated by ""noise"" due to
finite meshing and/or measurement errors. This problem can be overcome by the
use of field data on a surface outside of the reference trajectory to
reconstruct the fields along and around the reference trajectory. The integral
kernels for Laplace's equation that provide interior fields in terms of
boundary data or boundary sources are smoothing: interior fields will be
analytic even if the boundary data or source distributions fail to be
differentiable or are even discontinuous. In our approach, we employ all three
components of the field on the surface to find a superposition of single-layer
and double-layer surface source distributions that can be used together with
simple, surface-shape-independent kernels for computing vector potentials and
their multiple derivatives (required for a Hamiltonian map integration) at
interior points. These distributions and kernels are found by the aid of
Helmholtz's theorem (or equivalently, by Green's theorem). A novel application
of the Dirac-monopole vector potential is used to find a kernel for the
single-layer distribution. These methods are the basis for map-generating
modules that can be added to existing numerical electromagnetic field-solving
codes and would produce transfer maps to any order for arbitrary static
charged-particle beamline elements.

the characteristics of spam and the technology used by spammers. In order to
counter anti spam technology, spammers change their mode of operation,
therefore continues evaluation of the characteristics of spam and spammers
technology has become mandatory. These evaluations help us to enhance the
existing anti spam technology and thereby help us to combat spam effectively.
In order to characterize spam, we collected four hundred thousand spam mails
from a corporate mail server for a period of 14 months from January 2006 to
February 2007. For analysis we classified spam based on attachment and
contents. We observed that spammers use software tools to send spam with
attachment. The main features of this software are hiding sender's identity,
randomly selecting text messages, identifying open relay machines, mass mailing
capability and defining spamming duration. Spammers do not use spam software to
send spam without attachment. From our study we observed that, four years old
heavy users email accounts attract more spam than four years old light users
mail accounts. Relatively new email accounts which are 14 months old do not
receive spam. But in some special cases like DDoS attacks, we found that new
email accounts receive spam and 14 months old heavy users email accounts have
attracted more spam than 14 months old light users. We believe that this
analysis could be useful to develop more efficient anti spam techniques.

motivates us in this work to develop a novel design framework and alternative

exploit a crucial characteristic of back pressure-type controllers that enables
us to develop a novel link rate allocation strategy that not only optimizes
long-term network utilization, but also yields loop free multi-path routes}

scheduling strategy, based on a token-based service discipline, for shaping the

distribution with important implications for both human and animal health. The
emergence of Rift Valley fever (RVF) in the Middle East, and its continuing
presence in many areas of Africa, has negatively impacted both medical and
veterinary infrastructures and human health. Furthermore, worldwide attention
should be directed towards the broader infection dynamics of RVFV. We propose a
new compartmentalized model of RVF and the related ordinary differential
equations to assess disease spread in both time and space; with the latter
driven as a function of contact networks. The model is based on weighted
contact networks, where nodes of the networks represent geographical regions
and the weights represent the level of contact between regional pairings for
each set of species. The inclusion of human, animal, and vector movements among
regions is new to RVF modeling. The movement of the infected individuals is not
only treated as a possibility, but also an actuality that can be incorporated
into the model. We have tested, calibrated, and evaluated the model using data
from the recent 2010 RVF outbreak in South Africa as a case study; mapping the
epidemic spread within and among three South African provinces. An extensive
set of simulation results shows the potential of the proposed approach for
accurately modeling the RVF spreading process in additional regions of the
world. The benefits of the proposed model are twofold: not only can the model
differentiate the maximum number of infected individuals among different
provinces, but also it can reproduce the different starting times of the
outbreak in multiple locations. Finally, the exact value of the reproduction
number is numerically computed and upper and lower bounds for the reproduction
number are analytically derived in the case of homogeneous populations.

Durisen that hydrogen-rich explosions on accreting white dwarfs, classical
novae (CNe), will sweep out the ICM from the cluster more frequently than
galactic plane crossings. From the CNe rate and stellar mass-loss rate, this
clearing mechanism predicts that ~ 0.03 M_sun should be present in <= 10^5
M_sun GCs. We model the expanding remnant made from the 10^-4 M_sun nova ejecta
and show that it escapes long before it has cooled. We discuss the few positive
ICM measurements and use a Monte-Carlo simulation of the accumulation and CNe
recurrence times to reveal the possible variance in the ICM masses for the
higher mass (> 5x10^5 M_sun) GCs. We find that nova shells are effective at
clearing the ICM in low-mass GCs (<= 10^5 M_sun), whereas higher-mass clusters
may experience a quiescent time between novae long enough to prevent the next
nova shell from escaping. The nova clearing mechanism will also operate in
ultra-faint Milky Way satellites, where many upper limits on gas masses are
available.

~0.01-3.0 keV. SWIM measures solar wind ions, magnetosheath and magnetotail

scheme for MANETs, especially in harsh environments, based on the concept of
survivability to support QoS requirements and to protect bandwidth efficiently.
With the incorporation of clustering algorithms in survivability technology, we
employ a simple network configuration and expect to reduce occurrences of
faults in MANETs. At the same time, we address the scalability problem, which
represents a great challenge to network configuration. We do expect a
simplification of accessing bandwidth allocation with required QoS support for
different applications.

virtue of the diagonal embedding method. This method mods out the three E6
factors of an even self-dual momentum-lattice by a permutation symmetry. In
order to realize the E6^3 even self-dual lattice, we utilize the lattice

two lead to new E6 models. Though these models still share the unsatisfactory

19312+1950 is consistent with the nature of an asymptotic giant branch (AGB)
star or post-AGB star. Interestingly, however, some of the observational
properties cannot be readily explained within the standard scheme of stellar
evolution, and those are rather reminiscent of young stellar objects. In the
present research we considered the evolutionary status of IRAS 19312+1950 as
revealed by the VLBI and MERLIN observations in SiO, H2O and OH maser lines.
The double-peaked profile of the 22 GHz H2O maser line is clearly detected,
with the emission regions of its red and blue-shifted components separately
located, leaving a space of about 10.9 mas between them. The kinematic
properties of H2O maser emission region appear to be more consistent with a
bipolar flow rather than other interpretations such as the Keplerian rotation
of a disk. The red-shifted component of the SiO maser emission, which exhibits
a double-peak profile in previous single-dish observations, is clearly detected
in the present interferometry, while the 1612 MHz OH maser line exhibits a
complicated line profile consisting of a single strong peak and many weak,
high-velocity spikes. The structure of OH maser emission region is partially
resolved, and the kinematic properties of the OH maser emission region are
reminiscent observations of a spherically expanding shell, even though the
evidence is scant. Collectively, the maser observations described here provide
additional support for the evolved star hypothesis for IRAS 19312+1950.

problem analytically with the help of the well known spherically symmetric but
inhomogeneous Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi(LTB) model generalised to higher
dimensions. It is observed that in contrast to the claim made by Kolb et al the
presence of inhomogeneities as well as extra dimensions can not reverse the
signature of the deceleration parameter if the matter field obeys the energy
conditions. The well known Raychaudhuri equation also points to the same
result. Without solving the field equations explicitly it can, however, be
shown that although the total deceleration is positive everywhere nevertheless
it does not exclude the possibility of having radial acceleration, even in the
pure dust universe, if the angular scale factor is decelerating fast enough and
vice versa. Moreover it is found that introduction of extra dimensions can not
reverse the scenario. To the contrary it actually helps the decelerating
process.

stars are unstable to convection, a coupling may exist between the convection
and the internal rotation. We explore what can be learned from spectroscopic
and interferometric observations about the properties of the rotation law in
the external layers of these objects. Using simple relations between the
entropy and specific rotational quantities, some of which are found to be
efficient at accounting for the solar differential rotation in the convective
region, we derived analytical solutions that represent possible differential
rotations in the envelope of early-type stars. A surface latitudinal
differential rotation may not only be an external imprint of the inner
rotation, but induces changes in the stellar geometry, the gravitational
darkening, the aspect of spectral line profiles, and the emitted spectral
energy distribution. By studying the equation of the surface of stars with
non-conservative rotation laws, we conclude that objects undergo geometrical
deformations that are a function of the latitudinal differential rotation able
to be scrutinized both spectroscopically and by interferometry. The combination
of Fourier analysis of spectral lines with model atmospheres provides
independent estimates of the surface latitudinal differential rotation and the
inclination angle. Models of stars at different evolutionary stages rotating
with internal conservative rotation laws were calculated to show that the Roche
approximation can be safely used to account for the gravitational potential.
The surface temperature gradient in rapid rotators induce an acceleration to
the surface angular velocity. A non-zero differential rotation parameter may
indicate that the rotation is neither rigid nor shellular underneath the
stellar surface.

the curvature perturbation. We point out that, for example, it is possible that
the non-gaussianity parameter $\fnl\simeq 0$ while $\gnl$ is non-zero. In the

ignore non-quadratic terms in the potential, and that only a self-interaction

subjected to radial external forces resulting in a deformation of the droplet

leads to tangential forces on the particles. For small deformations and for the
contact angle $\theta_0$ at the substrate being equal to $\pi/2$, the
corresponding linearized Young-Laplace equation is solved analytically. The
solution is constructed by employing the method of images from electrostatics,
where each of the particles plays the role of a capillary monopole and the
substrate is replaced by a virtual drop with image charges and by imposing the
conditions of fixed droplet volume and vanishing total force on the droplet.
The substrate boundary conditions determine the signs of the image capillary
charges and therefore also the strength of the tangential forces on the

the accuracy of the calibration techniques used is of considerable importance.
Moreover, since these telescopes produce huge amounts of data, speed of
convergence of calibration is a major bottleneck. The errors in calibration are
due to system noise (sky and instrumental) as well as the estimation errors
introduced by the calibration technique itself, which we call solver noise. We
define solver noise as the distance between the optimal solution (the true
value of the unknowns, uncorrupted by the system noise) and the solution
obtained by calibration. We present the Space Alternating Generalized
Expectation Maximization (SAGE) calibration technique, which is a modification
of the Expectation Maximization algorithm, and compare its performance with the
traditional Least Squares calibration based on the level of solver noise
introduced by each technique. For this purpose, we develop statistical methods
that use the calibrated solutions to estimate the level of solver noise. The
SAGE calibration algorithm yields very promising results both in terms of
accuracy and speed of convergence. The comparison approaches we adopt introduce

of the support and its spatial localization. This question is very related with
pure essence of the derivation of the Schr\""{o}dinger equation since it is
well-known that if the linear Schr\""{o}dinger equation is perturbated with
""regular"" potentials then the corresponding solution never vanishes on a
positive measured subset of the domain, which corresponds with the
impossibility of localize the particle. Here we shall prove that if the
perturbation involves suitable singular nonlinear terms then the support of the
solution becomes a compact set and so any estimate on its spatial localization
implies a very rich information on places which can not be. Our results are
obtained by the application of some energy methods which connect the
compactness of the support with the local vanishing of a suitable ""energy

achievement, the optimistic polarization degrees for both electron and positron
beams are taken into account to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio revealing the
observable difference between supersymmetry breaking models. The minimal
supergravity model and the minimal SU(5) grand unified model in gaugino
mediation have been examined as examples. We see that after several years of
accummulating data, the difference of the number of single-photon events
between the two models received from the collider would be in excess of three
times the statistical error, providing us the possibility to probe which model
would be realized in nature. The result is well suitable for the future running
of the International Linear Collider.

a weighted tree $\tree$ where the weight of each node is the sum of the weights
of its children. A treemap for $\tree$ is a hierarchical partition of a
rectangle into simply connected regions, usually rectangles. Each region
represents a node of $\tree$ and its area is proportional to the weight of the
corresponding node. An important quality criterion for treemaps is the aspect
ratio of its regions. One cannot bound the aspect ratio if the regions are
restricted to be rectangles. In contrast, \emph{polygonal partitions}, that use
convex polygons, have bounded aspect ratio. We are the first to obtain convex
partitions with optimal aspect ratio $O(\depth(\tree))$. However,
$\depth(\tree)$ still depends on the input tree. Hence we introduce a new type
of treemaps, namely \emph{orthoconvex treemaps}, where regions representing
leaves are rectangles, L-, and S-shapes, and regions representing internal
nodes are orthoconvex polygons. We prove that any input tree, irrespective of
the weights of the nodes and the depth of the tree, admits an orthoconvex
treemap of constant aspect ratio. We also obtain several specialized results
for single-level treemaps, that is, treemaps where the input tree has depth~1.

uncertainty relation noted in the past are in fact understood in this way. We
here numerically illustrate that a very small uncertainty product is realized
if one performs a suitable sampling of measured data which occur with a very
small probability. It is also shown that our analysis is consistent with the
Landau-Pollak type uncertainty relation. It is suggested that the present

Dirac or Majorana. However, it was recently suggested by Allaverdi, Dutta and
one of the authors (R.N.M.) that mixed, or bimodal, flavor neutrino scenarios
are conceivable and are consistent with all known observations (these were
called ""schizophrenic"" in the ADM paper). In that case each individual mass
eigenstate can be either Dirac or Majorana, so that the flavor eigenstates are
""large"" admixtures of both. An example of this ""bimodal"" situation is to
consider one mass state as a Dirac particle (with a sterile partner), while the
other two are of Majorana type. Since only Majorana particles contribute to
neutrinoless double beta decay, the usual dependence of this observable on the
neutrino mass is modified within this scenario. We study this in detail and, in
particular, generalize the idea for all possible bimodal combinations.
Inevitably, radiative corrections will induce a pseudo-Dirac nature to the
Dirac states at the one-loop level, and the effects of the pseudo-Dirac mass
splitting will show up in the flavor ratios of neutrinos from distant
cosmological sources. Comparison of the effective mass in neutrinoless double
beta decay as well as flavor ratios at neutrino telescopes, for different
pseudo-Dirac cases and with their usual phenomenology, can distinguish the

may help in discriminating between models. Here we present the results of our
SED modeling of the blazar S5 0716+714 during various phases of its activity.
The SEDs are classified into different bins depending on the optical brightness

The generated graph states fall into an important class that can hugely reduce
the resource requirement of fault-tolerant linear optics quantum computation,

atoms, we also propose a heralded generation scheme, which allows for
high-fidelity graph states even under the photon loss.

the Ginzburg-Landau critical current Ic. The Meissner current state of the
films of intermediate width transforms at I > 0.8Ic to the vortex resistive
state which exists within the current interval 0.8Ic < I < Im, where the value
Im of the upper critical current is in a good agreement with the theory. The

major difference between the previous notions and topological toric manifolds

support a smooth action of a $\C^*$-torus. We also discuss their relation in

blazars by compact magnetized condensations (blobs), produced when red giant
stars cross the jet close to the central black hole. Our study includes a
simple dynamical model for the evolution of the envelope lost by the star in
the jet, and its high energy nonthermal emission through different leptonic and
hadronic radiation mechanisms. We show that the fragmented envelope of the star
can be accelerated to Lorentz factors up to 100 and radiate effectively the
available energy in gamma-rays predominantly through proton synchrotron
radiation or external inverse Compton scattering of electrons. The model can
readily explain the minute-scale TeV flares on top of longer (typical
time-scales of days) gamma-ray variability as observed from the blazar PKS
2155-304. In the framework of the proposed scenario, the key parameters of the
source are robustly constrained. In the case of proton synchrotron origin of
the emission a mass of the central black hole of $M_{\rm BH}\approx 10^8
