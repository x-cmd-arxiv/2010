reprocessing spectral components from Compton-thick material must be associated
to the accretion disc, and no evidence for the classical pc-scale torus is
found. The narrow core of the neutral iron K$\alpha$ line is therefore produced
in a Compton-thin material, like the BLR, similarly to what found in another
Seyfert galaxy, NGC7213, but with the notable difference that MCG+8-11-11
presents spectral signatures from an accretion disc. The very low accretion
rate of NGC7213 could explain the lack of relativistic signatures in its
spectrum, but the absence of the torus in both sources is more difficult to
explain, since their luminosities are comparable, and their accretion rates are
completely different.

problem pervading research on complex systems. Here, we present a simple,
direct method to infer the structural connection topology of a network, given
an observation of one collective dynamical trajectory. The general theoretical
framework is applicable to arbitrary network dynamical systems described by
ordinary differential equations. No interference (external driving) is required
and the type of dynamics is not restricted in any way. In particular, the
observed dynamics may be arbitrarily complex; stationary, invariant or
transient; synchronous or asynchronous and chaotic or periodic. Presupposing a
knowledge of the functional form of the dynamical units and of the coupling
functions between them, we present an analytical solution to the inverse
problem of finding the network topology. Robust reconstruction is achieved in
any sufficiently long generic observation of the system. We extend our method
to simultaneously reconstruct both the entire network topology and all
parameters appearing linear in the system's equations of motion. Reconstruction
of network topology and system parameters is viable even in the presence of
substantial external noise.

leptogenesis, where the final asymmetry is fully independent of the initial
conditions, when both heavy and light flavor effects are taken into account. In
particular the contribution to the final asymmetry from a residual initial
pre-existing asymmetry has to be negligible. We show that in the case of a
hierarchical right-handed (RH) neutrino mass spectrum, the only possible way is
a N_2-dominated leptogenesis scenario with a lightest RH neutrino mass M_1 <<
10^9 GeV and with a next-to-lightest RH neutrino mass 10^12 GeV >> M_2 >> 10^9
GeV. This scenario necessarily requires the presence of a heaviest third RH
neutrino specie. Moreover, we show that the final asymmetry has to be
dominantly produced in the tauon flavour while the electron and the muon
asymmetries have to be efficiently washed out by the lightest RH neutrino
inverse processes. Intriguingly, such seemingly special conditions for
successful strong thermal leptogenesis are naturally fulfilled within
SO(10)-inspired models. Besides the tauon N_2-dominated scenario, successful
strong thermal leptogenesis is also achieved in scenarios with quasi-degenerate
RH neutrino masses. We also comment on the supersymmetric case. We also derive
an expression for the final asymmetry produced from leptogenesis taking fully
into account heavy neutrino flavour effects in the specific case $M_1\gg
10^{12}\,{\rm GeV}$ (heavy flavoured scenario), a result that can be extended
to any other mass pattern.

leads to two inequivalent couplings J1 and J1', but this weak spatial
anisotropy does not affect the essential physics of the honeycomb spin lattice.
The structural realization of the honeycomb lattice is highly non-trivial: the
leading interactions J1 and J1' run via double bridges of VO4 tetrahedra
between spatially separated Cu atoms, while the interactions between structural
nearest neighbors are negligible. The non-negligible inter-plane coupling
Jperp~15 K gives rise to the long-range magnetic ordering at TN~26 K. Our model
simulations improve the fit of the magnetic susceptibility data, compared to
the previously assumed spin-chain models. Additionally, the simulated ordering

the previous result that higher luminosity sources (L_X>10^44 ergs/s) have
greater 870um fluxes but we also find that this subsample selects against
absorbed sources, faint in X-ray flux. Overall, we find that X-ray sources
contribute 1.5 \pm 0.1 Jy/deg^2 to the sub-mm background, ~3% of the total, in
agreement with the prediction of an obscured AGN model which also gives a
reasonable fit to the bright sub-mm source counts. This non-unified model also
suggests that when Compton-thick, X-ray-undetected sources are included, then
the fractional AGN contribution to the sub-mm background would rise from ~3% to
a total of 25-40%, although in a unified model the AGN contribution would only
reach ~13%, because the sub-mm flux of the X-ray sources is then more
representative of the whole AGN population. Measurements of the dependence of
sub-mm flux on X-ray flux, luminosity and column density all agree well with
the predictions of the non-unified AGN model. Heavily absorbed,
X-ray-undetected AGN could explain the further cross-correlation we find

Processor clock-rates
have plateaued, and increased performance is now appearing in the form of
additional processor cores on a single chip. This poses significant challenges
to the astronomy software community. Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), now
capable of general-purpose computation, exemplify both the difficult
learning-curve and the significant speedups exhibited by massively-parallel
hardware architectures. We present a generalised approach to tackling this
paradigm shift, based on the analysis of algorithms. We describe a small
collection of foundation algorithms relevant to astronomy and explain how they
may be used to ease the transition to massively-parallel computing
architectures. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it
to four well-known astronomy problems: Hogbom CLEAN, inverse ray-shooting for
gravitational lensing, pulsar dedispersion and volume rendering. Algorithms
with well-defined memory access patterns and high arithmetic intensity stand to
receive the greatest performance boost from massively-parallel architectures,
while those that involve a significant amount of decision-making may struggle
to take advantage of the available processing power.

model that leads to the viable cosmology presented in Dechant et al
(arXiv:0809.4335). Although this model (the DLH model) contains scalar field
matter, it is reminiscent of the Taub-NUT vacuum solution in that it has
biaxial Bianchi IX geometry and its evolution exhibits a dimensionality
reduction at a quasi-regular singularity that one can identify with the
big-bang. We show that the DLH and Taub-NUT metrics are related by a coordinate
transformation, in which the DLH time coordinate plays the role of conformal
time for Taub-NUT. Since both models continue through the big-bang, the
coordinate transformation can become multivalued. In particular, in mapping
from DLH to Taub-NUT, the Taub-NUT time can take only positive values. We
present explicit maps between the DLH and Taub-NUT models, with and without a
scalar field. In the vacuum DLH model, we find a periodic solution expressible
in terms of elliptic integrals. Mapping the vacuum solution over to Taub-NUT
coordinates, recovers the standard (non-periodic) Taub-NUT solution in the Taub
region, where Taub-NUT time takes positive values, but does not exhibit the two
NUT regions known in the standard Taub-NUT solution. Conversely, mapping the
complete Taub-NUT solution to the DLH case reveals that the NUT regions
correspond to imaginary time and space in DLH coordinates. We show that many of
the well-known `pathologies' of the Taub-NUT solution arise because the
traditional coordinates are connected by a multivalued transformation to the
physically more meaningful DLH coordinates. In particular, the
`open-to-closed-to-open' transition and the Taub and NUT regions of the
(Lorentzian) Taub-NUT model are replaced by a closed pancaking universe with
spacelike homogeneous sections at all times.

average the disks are larger than predicted by nearly an order of magnitude,
with sizes that grow with wavelength with an average slope of ~0.2 rather than
the slope of 4/3 predicted by the standard thin disk theory. Though the error
bars on the slope are large for individual quasars, the large sample size lends

or hypergraphs. Its application to graphs is usually done by considering the
sets of neighborhoods of the vertices (cf. Alon et al. (2006) and Chepoi,
Estellon, and Vaxes (2007)), hence providing a set-system. But the graph
structure is lost in the process. The aim of this paper is to introduce the
notion of paired VC-dimension, a generalization of VC-dimension to set-systems
endowed with a graph structure, hence a collection of pairs of subsets.
  The classical VC-theory is generally used in combinatorics to bound the
transversality of a hypergraph in terms of its fractional transversality and
its VC-dimension. Similarly, we bound the chromatic number in terms of
fractional transversality and paired VC-dimension. This approach turns out to
be very useful for a class of problems raised by Erd\H{o}s and Simonovits
(1973) asking for H-free graphs with minimum degree at least cn and arbitrarily
high chromatic number, where H is a fixed graph and c a positive constant.
  We show how the usual VC-dimension gives a short proof of the fact that
triangle-free graphs with minimum degree at least n/3 have bounded chromatic
number, where $n$ is the number of vertices. Using paired VC-dimension, we
prove that if the chromatic number of $H$-free graphs with minimum degree at
least cn is unbounded for some positive c, then it is unbounded for all c<1/3.
In other words, one can find H-free graphs with unbounded chromatic number and
minimum degree arbitrarily close to n/3. These H-free graphs are derived from a
construction of Hajnal. The large chromatic number follows from the Borsuk-Ulam
Theorem.

quality to enable a reliable classification. 116 sources (or ~27%) were

significantly higher AGN identification rate amongst local galaxies (>20%) than
in any previous galaxy survey. A small fraction of the type 1 AGN could have
their optical colors reddened by optically thin dust with A_V<2 mag relative to
optically selected QSOs. A handful show evidence for excess far-IR emission.
The equivalent width (EW) and color distributions of the type 1 and 2 AGN are
consistent with AGN unified models. In particular, the EW of the [OIII]
emission line weakly correlates with optical--near-IR color in each class of
AGN, suggesting anisotropic obscuration of the AGN continuum. Overall, the
optical properties of the 2MASS red AGN are not dramatically different from
those of optically-selected QSOs. Our near-IR selection appears to detect the
most near-IR luminous QSOs in the local universe to z~0.6 and provides

in many species this process begins with cilia-driven flow in a structure
termed the `node'. Primary `whirling' cilia, tilted towards the posterior,
transport morphogen-containing vesicles towards the left, initiating left-right
asymmetric development. We review recent theoretical models based on the
point-force stokeslet and point-torque rotlet singularities, explaining how
rotation and surface-tilt produce directional flow. Analysis of image
singularity systems enforcing the no-slip condition shows how tilted rotation
produces a far-field `stresslet' directional flow, and how time-dependent
point-force and time-independent point-torque models are in this respect
equivalent. Associated slender body theory analysis is reviewed; this approach
enables efficient and accurate simulation of three-dimensional time-dependent
flow, time-dependence being essential in predicting features of the flow such
as chaotic advection, which have subsequently been determined experimentally. A
new model for the nodal flow utilising the regularized stokeslet method is
developed, to model the effect of the overlying Reichert's membrane. Velocity
fields and particle paths within the enclosed domain are computed and compared
with the flow profiles predicted by previous `membrane-less' models.
Computations confirm that the presence of the membrane produces flow-reversal
in the upper region, but no continuous region of reverse flow close to the
epithelium. The stresslet far-field is no longer evident in the membrane model,
due to the depth of the cavity being of similar magnitude to the cilium length.
Simulations predict that vesicles released within one cilium length of the
epithelium are generally transported to the left via a `loopy drift' motion,
sometimes involving highly unpredictable detours around leftward cilia

analysis of spectro-polarimetric observations of photospheric Fe I lines with

downflow patches have a size of 0.5"" or smaller and have a geometrical
configuration different from that of the Evershed flow. The downflow velocity
is about 1 km/s at lower photspheric layers, and is almost zero in the upper
layers. Some of the downflow patches are associated with brightenings seen in
Ca II H images. The downflows are possible observational signatures of downward
flows driven by magnetic reconnection in the interlaced magnetic field
configuration, where upward flows make brightenings in the chromosphere.
Another possibility is that they are concentrated downward flows of overturning

verify and further investigate this striking behaviour. Our study sheds light
on the transport properties of large-area graphene samples. Furthermore,
purposeful engineering of periodic grain boundaries with tunable transport gaps
would allow for controlling charge currents without the need of introducing
bulk band gaps in otherwise semimetallic graphene. The proposed approach can be

Model. On examining the clusters at corresponding points in the cold valleys
(points with same A_2) of the various isotopes of a particular nucleus we find
that at certain mass numbers of the parent nuclei, the clusters emitted are
getting shifted to the next lower atomic number. It is interesting to see that
the change in clusters appears at those isotopes where a change in shape is
occurring correspondingly. Such a change of clusters with shape change is
studied for the first time in cluster decay. The alpha decay half lives of

increases the N \neq Z cluster emissions become equally or more probable than

probable from the parents in the heavier mass region (A=180-198) than from the

addition, the non-Byzantine nodes may undergo transient failures. Nodes advance
in atomic steps, which consist of reading all registers, performing some
calculation and writing to all registers.
  This paper contains three main contributions. First, the clock-function
problem is defined, which is a generalization of the clock synchronization
problem. This generalization encapsulates previous clock synchronization
problem definitions while extending them to the current paper's model. Second,
a randomized asynchronous self-stabilizing Byzantine tolerant clock
synchronization algorithm is presented.
  In the construction of the clock synchronization algorithm, a building block
that ensures different nodes advance at similar rates is developed. This
feature is the third contribution of the paper. It is self-stabilizing and
Byzantine tolerant and can be used as a building block for different algorithms
that operate in an asynchronous self-stabilizing Byzantine model.
  The convergence time of the presented algorithm is exponential. Observe that
in the asynchronous setting the best known full-information dynamic Byzantine
agreement also has expected exponential convergence time, even though currently

test of software following the practices of Behavior Driven Development (BDD)
in Python language. The usage of this stack highlights the specification and
validation of the software's expected behavior, reducing the error rate and
improving documentation. Therefore, it is possible to produce code with much
less defects at both functional and unit levels, in addition to better serving
to stakeholders' expectations.

and the small-large Fermi surface transition in recent experiments has led to
the proposal that frustration is an important additional tuning parameter in
the Kondo lattice model of heavy fermion materials. The introduction of a Kondo
(K) and a frustration (Q) axis into the phase diagram permits us to discuss the
physics of heavy fermion materials in a broader perspective. The current
experimental situation is analysed in the context of this combined ""QK"" phase
diagram. We discuss various theoretical models for the frustrated Kondo
lattice, using general arguments to characterize the nature of the $f$-electron
localization transition that occurs between the spin liquid and heavy Fermi
liquid ground-states. We concentrate in particular on the Shastry--Sutherland
Kondo lattice model, for which we establish the qualitative phase diagram using
strong coupling arguments and the large-$N$ expansion. The paper closes with
some brief remarks on promising future theoretical directions.

geometries could be analyzed in terms of six dimensional, ambient, Riemannian
geometries admitting a closed homothety. Recently it was shown how conformal
geometry provides a description of physics manifestly invariant under local
choices of unit systems. Strikingly, Einstein's equations are then equivalent
to the existence of a parallel scale tractor (a six component vector subject to
a certain first order covariant constancy condition at every point in four
dimensional spacetime). These results suggest a six dimensional description of
four dimensional physics, a viewpoint promulgated by the two times physics
program of Bars. The Fefferman--Graham construction relies on a triplet of
operators corresponding, respectively to a curved six dimensional light cone,
the dilation generator and the Laplacian. These form an sp(2) algebra which
Bars employs as a first class algebra of constraints in a six-dimensional gauge
theory. In this article four dimensional gravity is recast in terms of six
dimensional quantum mechanics by melding the two times and tractor approaches.
This ""parent"" formulation of gravity is built from an infinite set of six
dimensional fields. Successively integrating out these fields yields various
novel descriptions of gravity including a new four dimensional one built from a
scalar doublet, a tractor vector multiplet and a conformal class of metrics.

  algorithm versions added, one version removed 4. Changed algorithm COMP -
  cases CS2/CS4 are solved in a new way",,,,"cs.DS cs.DM math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One exact and two heuristic algorithms for determining the generators, orbits
and order of the graph automorphism group are presented. A basic tool of these
algorithms is the well-known individualization and refinement procedure. A
search tree is used in the algorithms - each node of the tree is a partition.
All nonequivalent discreet partitions derivative of the selected vertices are
stored in a coded form. A new strategy is used in the exact algorithm: if
during its execution some of the searched or intermediate variables obtain a
wrong value then the algorithm continues from a new start point losing some of
the results determined so far. The algorithms has been tested on one of the
known benchmark graphs and shows lower running times for some graph families.
The heuristic versions of the algorithms are based on determining some number
of discreet partitions derivative of each vertex in the selected cell of the
initial partition and comparing them for an automorphism - their search trees
are reduced. The heuristic algorithms are almost exact and are many times
faster than the exact one. The experimental tests exhibit that the worst-cases
running time of the exact algorithm is exponential but it is polynomial for the
heuristic algorithms. Several cell selectors are used. Some of them are new. We
also use a chooser of cell selector for choosing the optimal cell selector for
the manipulated graph. The proposed heuristic algorithms use two main heuristic
procedures that generate two different forests of search trees.
