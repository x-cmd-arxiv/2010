optimization problem that has attracted the interest of researchers around the

both feasible and infeasible schedules, and can be generated efficiently. For
the largest TTP challenge problems with up to 40 teams, solutions found using
this neighbourhood are the best currently known, and for smaller problems with
10 teams, three solutions found were subsequently proven optimal.

accounting for general overhead as a function of the number of users and
antennas in the network. The model includes both perfect and imperfect channel
state information based on channel estimation in the presence of noise. Three
low complexity methods are proposed for reducing the impact of overhead in the
sum network throughput by partitioning users into orthogonal groups. The first
method allocates spectrum to the groups equally, creating an imbalance in the
sum rate of each group. The second proposed method allocates spectrum unequally
among the groups to provide rate fairness. Finally, geographic grouping is
proposed for cases where some receivers do not observe significant interference
from other transmitters. For each partitioning method, the optimal solution not
only requires a brute force search over all possible partitions, but also
requires full channel state information, thereby defeating the purpose of
partitioning. We therefore propose greedy methods to solve the problems,
requiring no instantaneous channel knowledge. Simulations show that the
proposed greedy methods switch from time-division to interference alignment as
the coherence time of the channel increases, and have a small loss relative to
optimal partitioning only at moderate coherence times.

network. Nodes in the network print their own currency and trust each other for
a certain amount of each other's currency. This allows the network to serve as
a decentralized payment infrastructure---arbitrary payments can be routed
through the network by passing IOUs between trusting nodes in their respective
currencies---and obviates the need for a common currency. Nodes can repeatedly
transact with each other and pay for the transaction using trusted currency. A
natural question to ask in this setting is: how long can the network sustain
liquidity, i.e., how long can the network support the routing of payments
before credit dries up? We answer this question in terms of the long term
failure probability of transactions for various network topologies and credit
values.
  We prove that the transaction failure probability is independent of the path
along which transactions are routed. We show that under symmetric transaction
rates, the transaction failure probability in a number of well-known graph
families goes to zero as the size, density or credit capacity of the network
increases. We also show via simulations that even networks of small size and
credit capacity can route transactions with high probability if they are
well-connected. Further, we characterize a centralized currency system as a
special type of a star network (one where edges to the root have infinite
credit capacity, and transactions occur only between leaf nodes) and compute
the steady-state transaction failure probability in a centralized system. We
show that liquidity in star networks, complete graphs and Erd\""{o}s-R\'{e}nyi
networks is comparable to that in equivalent centralized currency systems; thus
we do not lose much liquidity in return for their robustness and decentralized
properties.

Yang-Mills theories. Then, we define a thick center vortex as a diagonal
deformation of the thin object. Besides the usual thick background profile,
this deformation also contains a frame defect coupled with gyromagnetic ratio
$g^{(d)}_m=1$, originated from the charged sector. As a consequence, the
analysis of stability is modified. In particular, we point out that the defect
should stabilize a vortex configuration formed by a pair of straight components

a fixed delay at the receiver over a burst-erasure channel. This paper
introduces a new class of streaming codes: Diversity Embedded Streaming Erasure
Codes (DE-SCo), that provide a flexible tradeoff between the channel quality
and receiver delay. When the channel conditions are good, the source stream is
recovered with a low delay, whereas when the channel conditions are poor the
source stream is still recovered, albeit with a larger delay. Information
theoretic analysis of the underlying burst-erasure broadcast channel reveals
that DE-SCo achieve the minimum possible delay for the weaker user, without
sacrificing the single-user optimal performance of the stronger user. Our

when remote users communicate with a human-readable knowledge base (KB).
Responsiveness [R(s)] is considered here as a measure of service quality.
Method. The preferred method is operational analysis, a variation of classical
stochastic theory, which allows for the study of user-system interaction with
minimal computational effort. Analysis. The analysis is based on well-known
performance metrics, such as service ability, elapsed time, and throughput:
from these metrics estimates of R(s) are derived analytically. Results.
Critical points indicating congestion are obtained: these are limits on the
number of admissible requests and the number of connected users. Also obtained
is a sufficient condition for achieving flow balance between the KB host and
the request-relaying servers. Conclusions. When R(s) is within normal limits,
users should appreciate the benefits from using the services offered by their
KB host. When bottlenecks are formed, R(s) declines, and the whole
communication system heads for saturation. Flow balancing procedures are
necessary for the elimination of bottlenecks, which leads to a better resource
management.

theory. Afterwards a term in the action that softly violates the detailed
balance condition has been considered with the attempt of obtaining a more
realistic theory in its IR-limit. This term is proportional to $\omega
R^{(3)}$, where $\omega$ is a constant parameter and $R^{(3)}$ is the spatial
Ricci scalar. In this paper we derive constraints on this IR-modified
Ho\v{r}ava theory using the late-time cosmic accelerating expansion
observations. We obtain a lower bound of $|\omega|$ that is nontrivial and
depends on $\Lambda_W$, the cosmological constant of the three dimensional
spatial action in the Ho\v{r}ava gravity. We find that to preserve the detailed
balance condition, one needs to fine-tune $\Lambda_W$ such that $- 2.29\times
10^{-4}< (c^2 \Lambda_W)/(H^2_0 \currentDE) - 2 < 0 $, where $H_0$ and
$\currentDE$ are the Hubble parameter and dark energy density fraction in the
present epoch, respectively. On the other hand, if we do not insist on the
detailed balance condition, then the valid region for $\Lambda_W$ is much
relaxed to $-0.39< (c^2 \Lambda_W)/(H^2_0 \currentDE) - 2 < 0.12$. We find that
although the detailed balance condition cannot be ruled out, it is strongly
disfavored.

about it remains unclosed. In this paper, based on the recent experimental
results and existing theoretical models, a spider-like model is provided. In
this model, each motor is regarded as a bead-spring system. The bead can bind
to or unbind from the track stochastically, and step forward or backward with
fixed step size L and force dependent transition rates. The spring connects the
bead to cargo tightly. At any time, the position of cargo is determined by
force balance condition. The obvious characteristics of our model are that, the
motors interact with each other and they do not share the external load
equally. Our results indicate, the stall force of cargo, under which the mean
velocity of cargo vanishes, usually decreases with the interactions between
motors. If the cargo is pulled by several motors from same motor species, the
stall force of cargo is bigger than that of the single motor, but usually
smaller than their sum. However, if the cargo is pulled by two motors with
different directionality, the stall force of cargo might bigger or smaller than
the difference of the two single motor stall forces. The results imply,
cooperation of several motors is helpful to pull big cargoes, though it is not
so good as might be expected and no obvious help to improve the velocity.

algorithms on graphical models. We define block-tree graphs as a
tree-structured graph where each node is a cluster of nodes such that the
clusters in the graph are disjoint. This differs from junction-trees, where two
clusters connected by an edge always have at least one common node. When
compared to junction-trees, we show that constructing block-tree graphs is
faster, and finding optimal block-tree graphs has a much smaller search space.
Applying our block-tree graph framework to graphical models, we show that, for
some graphs, e.g., grid graphs, using block-tree graphs for inference is
computationally more efficient than using junction-trees. For graphical models
with boundary conditions, the block-tree graph framework transforms the
boundary valued problem into an initial value problem. For Gaussian graphical
models, the block-tree graph framework leads to a linear state-space
representation. Since exact inference in graphical models can be
computationally intractable, we propose to use spanning block-trees to derive
approximate inference algorithms. Experimental results show the improved
performance in using spanning block-trees versus using spanning trees for
approximate estimation over Gaussian graphical models.
