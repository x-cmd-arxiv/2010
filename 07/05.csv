can lead to quantum interference in the electronic excitation pathways. A
prominent example observed in atomic three-level-systems is the phenomenon of
electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), in which a control laser
induces a narrow spectral transparency window for a weak probe laser beam. The
concomitant rapid variation of the refractive index in this spectral window can
give rise to dramatic reduction of the group velocity of a propagating pulse of
probe light. Dynamic control of EIT via the control laser enables even a
complete stop, that is, storage, of probe light pulses in the atomic medium.
Here, we demonstrate optomechanically induced transparency (OMIT)--formally
equivalent to EIT--in a cavity optomechanical system operating in the resolved
sideband regime. A control laser tuned to the lower motional sideband of the
cavity resonance induces a dipole-like interaction of optical and mechanical
degrees of freedom. Under these conditions, the destructive interference of
excitation pathways for an intracavity probe field gives rise to a window of
transparency when a two-photon resonance condition is met. As a salient feature
of EIT, the power of the control laser determines the width and depth of the
probe transparency window. OMIT could therefore provide a new approach for
delaying, slowing and storing light pulses in long-lived mechanical excitations
of optomechanical systems, whose optical and mechanical properties can be
tailored in almost arbitrary ways in the micro- and nano-optomechanical
platforms developed to date.

network elements is determined by the the network structure is the topic of our
work. We map the structure of signal flow in directed networks by analysing the
degree of edge convergence and the overlap between the in- and output sets of
an edge. Definitions of convergence degree and overlap are based on the
shortest paths, thus they encapsulate global network properties. Using the
defining notions of convergence degree and overlapping set we clarify the
meaning of network causality and demonstrate the crucial role of chordless
circles. In real-world networks the flow representation distinguishes nodes
according to their signal transmitting, processing and control properties. The
analysis of real-world networks in terms of flow representation was in
accordance with the known functional properties of the network nodes. It is
shown that nodes with different signal processing, transmitting and control
properties are randomly connected at the global scale, while local connectivity
patterns depart from randomness. Grouping network nodes according to their
signal flow properties was unrelated to the network's community structure. We
present evidence that signal flow properties of small-world-like, real-world
networks can not be reconstructed by algorithms used to generate small-world
networks. Convergence degree values were calculated for regular oriented trees,
and its probability density function for networks grown with the preferential
attachment mechanism. For Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs we calculated both the
probability density function of convergence degrees and of overlaps.

problems such as quickest time change detection. Individual agents make myopic
local decisions via social learning, that is, each agent records a private
observation of a noisy underlying state process, selfishly optimizes its local
utility and then broadcasts its local decision. Given these local decisions,
how can a global decision maker achieve quickest time change detection when the
underlying state changes according to a phase-type distribution? The paper
presents four results. First, using Blackwell dominance of measures, it is
shown that the optimal cost incurred in social learning based quickest
detection is always larger than that of classical quickest detection. Second,
it is shown that in general the optimal decision policy for social learning
based quickest detection is characterized by multiple thresholds within the
space of Bayesian distributions. Third, using lattice programming and
stochastic dominance, sufficient conditions are given for the optimal decision
policy to consist of a single linear hyperplane, or, more generally, a
threshold curve. Estimation of the optimal linear approximation to this
threshold curve is formulated as a simulation-based stochastic optimization
problem. Finally, the paper shows that in multi-agent sensor management with
quickest detection, where each agent views the world according to its prior,
the optimal policy has a similar structure to social learning.

planetary accretion (> 100 Myr). All the important effect of gas in laminar
disks are taken into account: the aerodynamic gas drag, the disk-planet
interaction including Type I migration, and the global disk potential which
causes inward migration of secular resonances as the gas dissipates. We vary
the initial total mass and spatial distribution of the planetesimals, the time
scale of dissipation of nebular gas, and orbits of Jupiter and Saturn. We end
up with one to five planets in the terrestrial region. In order to maintain
sufficient mass in this region in the presence of Type I migration, the time
scale of gas dissipation needs to be 1-2 Myr. The final configurations and
collisional histories strongly depend on the orbital eccentricity of Jupiter.
If today's eccentricity of Jupiter is used, then most of bodies in the
asteroidal region are swept up within the terrestrial region owing to the
inward migration of the secular resonance, and giant impacts between
protoplanets occur most commonly around 10 Myr. If the orbital eccentricity of
Jupiter is close to zero, as suggested in the Nice model, the effect of the
secular resonance is negligible and a large amount of mass stays for a long
period of time in the asteroidal region. With a circular orbit for Jupiter,
giant impacts usually occur around 100 Myr, consistent with the accretion time
scale indicated from isotope records. However, we inevitably have an Earth size
planet at around 2 AU in this case. It is very difficult to obtain spatially
concentrated terrestrial planets together with very late giant impacts.

and a parity of if odd. The parity operator, which is minus one to the power of
the photon number operator, is a Hermitian operator and thus a quantum
mechanical observable though it has no classical analog, the concept being
meaningless in the context of classical light waves. In this paper we review
work on the application of the parity operator to the problem of quantum
metrology for the detection of small phase shifts with quantum optical
interferometry using highly entangled field states such as the so-called N00N
states, and states obtained by injecting twin Fock states into a beam splitter.
With such states and with the performance of parity measurements on one of the
output beams of the interferometer, one can breach the standard quantum limit,
or shot-noise limit, of sensitivity down to the Heisenberg limit, the greatest
degree of phase sensitivity allowed by quantum mechanics for linear phase
shifts. Heisenberg limit sensitivities are expected to eventually play an
important role in attempts to detect gravitational waves in interferometric
detection systems such as LIGO and VIRGO.

spatially flat, homogeneous and isotropic. We use the
Einstein-Cartan-Kibble-Sciama (ECKS) theory of gravity which naturally extends
general relativity to include the spin of matter. The torsion of spacetime
generates gravitational repulsion in the early Universe filled with quarks and
leptons, preventing the cosmological singularity: the Universe expands from a
state of minimum but finite radius. We show that the dynamics of the closed
Universe immediately after this state naturally solves the flatness and horizon
problems in cosmology because of an extremely small and negative torsion
density parameter, $\Omega_S \approx -10^{-69}$. Thus the ECKS gravity provides
a compelling alternative to speculative mechanisms of standard cosmic
inflation. This scenario also suggests that the contraction of our Universe
preceding the bounce at the minimum radius may correspond to the dynamics of
matter inside a collapsing black hole existing in another universe, which could
explain the origin of the Big Bang.

planetary parameters and probe them for any time dependent variations. In
particular deviations of the period from a strictly linear ephemeris, transit
timing variations (TTVs), can indicate the presence of additional bodies in the
planetary system.
  Aims: Our goal was to reexamine the largely unstudied OGLE2-TR-L9 system with
high cadence, multi-color photometry in order to refine the planetary
parameters and probe the system for TTVs.
  Methods: We observed five full transits of OGLE2-TR-L9 with the GROND
instrument at the ESO/MPG 2.2 m telescope at La Silla Observatory. GROND is a
multichannel imager that allowed us to gather simultaneous light curves in the
g', r', i', and z' filters.
  Results: From our analysis we find that the semi-major axis and the
inclination differ from the previously published values. With the newly
observed transits, we were able to refine the ephemeris to 2454492.80008(+/-
0.00014) + 2.48553417(+/- 6.4) x 10^-7 E. The newly derived parameters are

to a finite density of charge carriers that can exhibit the characteristic
properties of strange metals. We compute holographically the low-frequency and
low-momentum form of the charge density and current retarded Green's functions
in these systems for massless charge carriers. The results reveal a
quasi-particle excitation when z<2, which in analogy with Landau Fermi liquids
we call zero sound. The real part of the dispersion relation depends on
momentum k linearly, while the imaginary part goes as k^2/z. When z is greater
than or equal to 2 the zero sound is not a well-defined quasi-particle. We also
compute the frequency-dependent conductivity in arbitrary spacetime dimensions.

effective radii. Multi-band imaging data from the HST/ACS are employed to
evaluate surface brightness profiles and isophotal shape parameters of
ellipticity, position angle and discyness/boxiness. The galaxies are found to
host a cold and old stellar component which extend to the largest observed
radii and that is the dominant source of their dynamical support. The
prevalence of discy-shaped isophotes and the radial variation of their
ellipticity are signatures of a gradual gas dissipation. An early star-forming
collapse appears to be the main mechanism acting in the formation of these
objects. Major mergers are unlikely to have occurred in these galaxies. We can
not rule out a minor merging origin for these galaxies, but a comparison of our
results with model predictions of different merger categories places some
constraints on the possible merger progenitors. These merger events are
required to happen at high-redshift (i.e., z > 1), between progenitors of
different mass ratio (at least 3:1) and containing a significant amount of gas
(i.e., > 10 percent). A further scenario is that the low-luminosity galaxies
were originally late-type galaxies, whose star formation has been truncated by
removal of gas and subsequently the disc has been dynamically heated by high

primary region and a screening region, to discuss $\gamma$-ray spectrum of
mature pulsars detected by $Fermi$. By solving the Poisson equation with an
assumed simple step-function distributions of the charge density in these two
regions, the distribution of the electric field and the curvature radiation
process of the accelerated particles can be calculated. In the our model, the
properties of the phase-averaged spectrum can be completely specified by three
gap parameters, i.e. the fractional gap size in the outer magnetosphere, the
gap current in the primary region and the gap size ratio between the primary
region and the total gap size. We discuss how these parameters affect the
spectral properties. We argue that although the radiation mechanism in the
outer gap is curvature radiation process, the observed gamma-ray spectrum can
substantially deviate from the simple curvature spectrum because the overall
spectrum consists of two components, i.e. the primary region and screening
region. In some pulsars the radiation from the screening region is so strong
that the photon index from 100MeV to several GeV can be as flat as $\sim 2$. We
show the fitting fractional gap thickness of the canonical pulsars increases
with the spin down age. We find that the total gap current is about 50~\% of
the Goldreich-Julian value and the thickness of the screening region is a few
percent of the total gap thickness. We also find that the predicted \gamma$-ray
luminosity is less dependent on the spin down power ($L_{sd}$) for the pulsars
with $L_{sd}\ga 10^{36}$~erg/s, while the $\gamma$-ray luminosity decreases
with the spin down power for the pulsars with $L_{sd}\la 10^{36}$~erg/s.

mass threshold is used as our primary quantity to characterize the large-scale
environment, while other parameters, such as the local overdensity and the
morphology of large-scale structure, are used for comparison. For halos at a
fixed mass, all the halo properties depend significantly on environment,
particularly the tidal field. The environmental dependence of halo assembly
time is primarily driven by local tidal field. The mass of the unbound fraction
in substructure is boosted in strong tidal force region, while the bound
fraction is suppressed. Halos have a tendency to spin faster in stronger tidal
field and the trend is stronger for more massive halos. The spin vectors show
significant alignment with the intermediate axis of the tidal field, as
expected from the tidal torque theory. Both the major and minor axes of halos
are strongly aligned with the corresponding principal axes of the tidal field.
In general, a halo that can accrete more material after the formation of its
main halo on average is younger, is more elongated, spins faster, and contains
a larger amount of substructure. Higher density environments not only provide
more material for halo to accrete, but also are places of stronger tidal field
that tends to suppress halo accretion. The environmental dependencies are the
results of these two competing effects. The tidal field based on halos can be
estimated from observation, and we discuss the implications of our results for
the environmental dependence of galaxy properties.

molecular clouds. Historically, the core had been assumed as an singular
isothermal sphere (SIS), and the collapse had been investigated by a
self-similar manner. This is while the rotation and magnetic field lead to
non-symmetric collapse so that a spheroid shape may be occurred. Here, the
resultant of the centrifugal force and magnetic field gradient is assumed to be
in the normal direction of the rotational axis, and its components are supposed
to be a fraction $\beta$ of the local gravitational force. In this research, a
collapsing SIS core is considered to find the importance of the parameter
$\beta$ for oblateness of the mass shells which are above the head of the
expansion wave. We apply the Adomian decomposition method to solve the system
of nonlinear partial differential equations because the collapse does not occur
in a spherical symmetry with self-similar behavior. In this way, we obtain a
semi-analytical relation for the mass infall rate $\dot{M}$ of the shells at
the envelope. Near the rotational axis, the $\dot{M}$ decreases with increasing
of the non-dimensional radius $\xi$, while a direct relation is observed
between $\dot{M}$ and $\xi$ in the equatorial regions. Also, the values of
$\dot{M}$ in the polar regions are greater than the equatorial values, and this
difference is more often at smaller values of $\xi$. Overall, the results show
that before reaching the head of expansion wave, the visible shape of the
molecular cloud cores can evolve to oblate spheroids. The ratio of major to
minor axes of oblate cores increases with increasing the parameter $\beta$, and
its value can approach to the apparently observed elongated shapes of cores in
the maps of molecular clouds such as Taurus and Perseus.

cool, optically thick disk and inner hot, optically thin, advection dominated

evaporation (Liu et al. 2002a). In this work, both the magnetic field and
Compton scattering of soft photons from the disk by electrons in the corona are
included to calculate the evaporation rates at different distances. The disk is
truncated at the distance where the evaporation rate equals to the accretion
rate ($\dot m_{\rm evap}(r_{\rm tr})=\dot m$). For a series of accretion rates,
the corresponding truncation radii are calculated out, with which we are able
to calculate the emergent spectra from the inner ADAF + outer disk + corona. At
very low accretion rates, the spectra are similar to that of a pure ADAF
because the disk is truncated at large distances. The disk component becomes
important at high accretion rates since the truncation occurs at small
distances. An anti-correlation between the Eddington ratio $\xi \equiv L_{\rm
0.5-25 \,keV}/L_{\rm Edd}$ and the hard X-ray photon index $\Gamma_{\rm 3-25

nonsymmetrical. This paper proposes a simple and natural strategy to mimic the
distributed behavior of the physical circuit by mimicking the distributed
behavior of the internal wires inside this circuit. Mimic Transmission Method
(MTM) is a new distributed algorithm to solve the nonlinear ordinary
differential equations extracted from physical circuits. It maps the
transmission delay of interconnects between subcircuits to the communication
delay of digital data link between processors. MTM is a black-box algorithm. By
mimicking the transmission lines, MTM seals the nonlinear dynamical system
within the subcircuit. As the result, we do not need to pay attention on how to
solve the nonlinear dynamic system or nonsymmetrical linear system in parallel.
MTM is a global direct algorithm, and it does only one distributed computation
at each time window to obtain accurate result, so unconvergence issues do not
need to be worried about.

the mineralogical composition and size distribution of the dust grains in disks
around 58 T Tauri stars observed with Spitzer/IRS. We present a spectral
decomposition model that reproduces the IRS spectra over the full spectral
range. The model assumes two dust populations: a warm component responsible for
the 10\mu m emission arising from the disk inner regions and a colder component
responsible for the 20-30\mu m emission, arising from more distant regions. We
show evidence for a significant size distribution flattening compared to the
typical MRN distribution, providing an explanation for the usual boxy 10\mu m
feature profile generally observed. We reexamine the crystallinity paradox,
observationally identified by Olofsson et al. (2009), and we find a
simultaneous enrichment of the crystallinity in both the warm and cold regions,
while grain sizes in both components are uncorrelated. Our modeling results do
not show evidence for any correlations between the crystallinity and either the
star spectral type, or the X-ray luminosity (for a subset of the sample). The
size distribution flattening may suggests that grain coagulation is a slightly
more effective process than fragmentation in disk atmospheres, and that this
imbalance may last over most of the T Tauri phase. This result may also point
toward small grain depletion via strong stellar winds or radiation pressure in
the upper layers of disk. The non negligible cold crystallinity fractions
suggests efficient radial mixing processes in order to distribute crystalline
grains at large distances from the central object, along with possible nebular
shocks in outer regions of disks that can thermally anneal amorphous grains.

use of the fibre nod-and-shuffle observing mode, but with potential cost in
observing efficiency. Finally we demonstrate that these disadvantages can be
overcome through the application of a Principle Components Analysis sky
subtraction routine. Such an approach minimise systematic residuals across long
duration exposures allowing deep integrations.
  We apply the PCA approach to over 200 hours of on-sky observations and
conclude that for the AAOmega system the residual error in long duration
observations falls at a rate proportional to t^-0.32 in contrast to the t^-0.5
rate expected from theoretical considerations. With this modest rate of
decline, the PCA approach represents a more efficient mode of observation than
the nod-and-shuffle technique for observations in the sky limited regime with
durations of 10-100 hours (even before accounting for the additional
signal-to-noise and targeting efficiency losses often associated with the N+S
technique).[abridged]

several ro-vibrational transitions between the vibrational ground state and the
low-energy nu2 bending mode at frequencies between 1654-1897 GHz along the
sight-lines to the submillimeter continuum sources W31C and W49N, using
Herschel's HIFI instrument. We detect C3 in absorption arising from the warm
envelope surrounding the hot core, as indicated by the velocity peak position
and shape of the line profile. The sensitivity does not allow to detect C3
absorption due to diffuse foreground clouds. From the column densities of the
rotational levels in the vibrational ground state probed by the absorption we
derive a rotation temperature (T_rot) of ~50--70 K, which is a good measure of
the kinetic temperature of the absorbing gas, as radiative transitions within
the vibrational ground state are forbidden. It is also in good agreement with
the dust temperatures for W31C and W49N. Applying the partition function
correction based on the derived T_rot, we get column densities N(C3)
~7-9x10^{14} cm^{-2} and abundance x(C3)~10^{-8} with respect to H2. For W31C,
using a radiative transfer model including far-infrared pumping by the dust
continuum and a temperature gradient within the source along the line of sight
we find that a model with x(C3)=10^{-8}, T_kin=30-50 K, N(C3)=1.5 10^{15}
cm^{-2} fits the observations reasonably well and provides parameters in very
good agreement with the simple excitation analysis.

Here, we show that in a non-abelian gauge field, a spinor condensate will
develop a spontaneous stripe structure in each spin component, reflecting a
ground state made up of two non-orthogonal dressed states with different

single dressed state. These momentum carrying stripes are the {\em macroscopic}

untargeted surveys, and perform the abundance determinatinos using three
different oxygen-abundance calibrations. The sites of SNe Ic (the demise of the
most heavily stripped stars having lost both the H and He layers) are
systematically more metal rich than those of SNe Ib (arising from stars that
retained their He layer) in all calibrations. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test yields
the very low probability of 1% that SN Ib and SN Ic environment abundances,
which are different on average by ~0.2 dex (in the Pettini & Pagel scale), are
drawn from the same parent population. Broad-lined SNe Ic (without GRBs) occur
at metallicities between those of SNe Ib and SNe Ic. Lastly, we find that the
host-galaxy central oxygen abundance is not a good indicator of the local SN
metallicity; hence, large-scale SN surveys need to obtain local abundance
measurements in order to quantify the impact of metallicity on stellar death.

competition between two groups. We show its relation to the innovation
spreading issues. We introduce an abstract model and show how it can be
interpreted in this framework, as well as what conclusions we can draw form it.
We further explain how model-derived conclusions can help to investigate the
original problem, as well as other, similar problems. The model is an
agent-based model assuming simple binary attributes of those agents. It uses a
majority dynamics (Ising model to be exact), meaning that individuals attempt
to be similar to the majority of their peers, barring the occasional purely
individual decisions that are modeled as random. We show that this simplistic
model can be related to the decision-making during innovation adoption
processes. The majority dynamics for the model mean that when a dominant
attribute, representing an existing practice or solution, is already
established, it will persists in the system. We show however, that in a two
group competition, a smaller group that represents innovation users can still
convince the larger group, if it has high self-support. We argue that this
conclusion, while drawn from a simple model, can be applied to real cases of
innovation spreading. We also show that the model could be interpreted in
different ways, allowing different problems to profit from our conclusions.

which is the real dominant engine of self-regulated heating? One of the model
we propose are massive subrelativistic outflows, probably generated by a wind
disc or just the result of the entrainment on kpc scale by the fast radio jet.
Using a modified version of AMR code FLASH 3.2, we explored several feedback
mechanisms which self-regulate the mechanical power. Two are the best schemes
that answer our primary question, id est quenching cooling flow and at the same
time preserving a cool core appearance for a long term evolution (7 Gyr): one
more explosive (with efficiencies 0.005 - 0.01), triggered by central cooled
gas, and the other gentler, ignited by hot gas Bondi accretion (with efficiency
0.1). These three-dimensional simulations show that the total energy injected
is not the key aspect, but the results strongly depend on how energy is given
to the ICM. We follow the dynamics of best model (temperature, density, SB maps
and profiles) and produce many observable predictions: buoyant bubbles,
ripples, turbulence, iron abundance maps and hydrostatic equilibrium deviation.

critical eye towards observational concordance.

favors a matter content that is of the order of the baryonic matter abundance

line--continuum correlation, which may be indicative of an extra line component
in addition to that from the normal broad emission line region. In this paper,
we investigate possible contribution to the Nv emission via resonant scattering
of both continuum and Ly alpha in a broad absorption line (BAL) outflow, by
performing the Sobolev Monte Carlo simulations. The contribution is dependent
on the covering factor, optical depth and velocity profile of the outflow, as
well as the equivalent width (EW) of Ly alpha. Adopting model parameters
constrained by observations, we find that the measured Nv EW in the spectra of
non-BAL quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) could have been enhanced by a factor of
1.82~2.73 on average, while there is only moderate absorption of Ly alpha along
the BAL outflow direction. Our model can produce a relatively narrow scattering
line profile. About 80% of the total scattered flux falls within the central
+-4500km/s. We find that the resonant scattering can produce a prominent
polarized emission line around Nv. Both the broad excess emission and the
unusually large polarized flux observed around Nv in BAL QSOs are considered as
strong evidence for the scattering enhancement. Future spectropolarimetric
observations and spectroscopic monitoring of luminous QSOs may offer crucial
tests for this interpretation, and provide useful information on the physical
and geometrical properties of QSO outflows. We argue that the scattering offers
a promising and robust process for producing the peculiar behavior of Nv
emission compared to the other processes proposed previously.

been obtained in the literature (see e.g. (Cordero-Erausquin2011), but the

evolution of accretion remains a matter of debate, observations and modelling
studies suggest that episodic outbursts of strong accretion may dominate the
formation of the protostar. Observing young stellar objects during these
elevated accretion states is crucial to understanding the origin of unsteady
accretion. ZCMa is a pre-main-sequence binary system composed of an embedded
Herbig Be star, undergoing photometric outbursts, and a FU Orionis star. The
Herbig Be component recently underwent its largest optical photometric outburst
detected so far. We aim to constrain the origin of this outburst by studying
the emission region of the HI Brackett gamma line, a powerful tracer of
accretion/ejection processes on the AU-scale in young stars. Using the
AMBER/VLTI instrument at spectral resolutions of 1500 and 12 000, we performed
spatially and spectrally resolved interferometric observations of the hot gas
emitting across the Brackett gamma emission line, during and after the
outburst. From the visibilities and differential phases, we derive
characteristic sizes for the Brackett gamma emission and spectro-astrometric
measurements across the line, with respect to the continuum. We find that the
line profile, the astrometric signal, and the visibilities are inconsistent
with the signature of either a Keplerian disk or infall of matter. They are,
instead, evidence of a bipolar wind, maybe partly seen through a disk hole
inside the dust sublimation radius. The disappearance of the Brackett gamma
emission line after the outburst suggests that the outburst is related to a
period of strong mass loss rather than a change of the extinction along the
line of sight. Based on these conclusions, we speculate that the origin of the
outburst is an event of enhanced mass accretion, similar to those occuring in
EX Ors and FU Ors.

hard spheres is much more intricate than its counterpart for inelastic smooth
spheres. Now the one-body distribution function depends not only on the
translational velocity of the center of mass but also on the angular velocity
of the particle. Moreover, the collision rules couple both velocities,
involving not only the coefficient of normal restitution but also the
coefficient of tangential restitution. The aim of this paper is to propose an
extension to inelastic rough particles of a Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook-like kinetic
model previously proposed for inelastic smooth particles. The Boltzmann
collision operator is replaced by the sum of three terms representing: (i) the
relaxation to a two-temperature local equilibrium distribution, (ii) the action
of a nonconservative drag force proportional to the peculiar velocity, and
(iii) the action of a nonconservative torque equal to a linear combination of
the angular velocity and its mean value. The three coefficients in the force
and torque are fixed to reproduce the Boltzmann collisional rates of change of
the mean angular velocity and of the two granular temperatures (translational
and rotational). A simpler version of the model is also constructed in the form
of two coupled kinetic equations for the translational and rotational velocity
distributions. The kinetic model is applied to the simple shear flow steady
state and the combined influence of the two coefficients of restitution on the
shear and normal stresses and on the translational velocity distribution
function is analyzed.

temperatures in a granular fluid mixture of inelastic rough hard spheres have
been derived. In the present paper the energy production rates are explicitly
decomposed into equipartition rates (tending to make all the temperatures
equal) plus genuine cooling rates (reflecting the collisional dissipation of
energy). Next the homogeneous free cooling state of a binary mixture is
analyzed, with special emphasis on the quasi-smooth limit. A previously
reported singular behavior (according to which a vanishingly small amount of
roughness has a finite effect, with respect to the perfectly smooth case, on
the asymptotic long-time translational/translational temperature ratio) is
further elaborated. Moreover, the study of the time evolution of the
temperature ratios shows that this dramatic influence of roughness already
appears in the transient regime for times comparable to the relaxation time of
perfectly smooth spheres.

Milky Way and in smaller chemically younger galaxies? Earlier work suggests a
more rapid transformation of H$_2$ into stars in these objects but (1) a doubt
remains about the validity of the H$_2$ mass estimates and (2) there is
currently no explanation for why star formation should be more efficient. M~33,
a local group spiral with a mass $\sim 10$\% and a metallicity half that of the
Galaxy, represents a first step towards the metal poor Dwarf Galaxies. We have
searched for molecular clouds in the outer disk of M~33 and present here a set
of detections of both $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO, including the only detections
(for both lines) beyond the R$_{25}$ radius in a subsolar metallicity galaxy.
The spatial resolution enables mass estimates for the clouds and thus a measure
of the $N({\rm H}_2) / I_{\rm CO}$ ratio, which in turn enables a more reliable
calculation of the H$_2$ mass. Our estimate for the outer disk of M~33 is
$N({\rm H}_2) / I_{\rm CO(1-0)} \sim 5 \times 10^{20} \,{\rm cm^{-2}/(K{\rm \
km \ s^{-1}})}$ with an estimated uncertainty of a factor $\le 2$. While the
$^{12/13}$CO line ratios do not provide a reliable measure of $N({\rm H}_2) /
I_{\rm CO}$, the values we find are slightly greater than Galactic and
corroborate a somewhat higher $N({\rm H}_2) / I_{\rm CO}$ value. Comparing the
CO observations with other tracers of the interstellar medium, no reliable
means of predicting where CO would be detected was identified. In particular,
CO detections were often not directly on local HI or FIR or H$\alpha$ peaks,
although generally in regions with FIR emission and high HI column density. The
results presented here provide support for the quicker transformation of H$_2$
into stars in M~33 than in large local universe spirals.

metal-enriched IMF with and a lower mass cutoff of >= 30Msun or (B) 2-4% of

  Systems","PhD thesis",,,,"nucl-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This thesis is dedictaed to the study of fluctuation and correlation
observables of hadronic equilibrium systems. The statistical hadronization
model of high energy physics, in its ideal, i.e. non-interacting, gas
approximation will be investigated in different ensemble formulations. The
hypothesis of thermal and chemical equilibrium in high energy interaction will
be tested against qualitative and quantitative predictions.
