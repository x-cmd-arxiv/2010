stress and strain to a multiphase system of constituents, composed of patches
with different damping and relaxation properties, we predict that the maximum

conjecture that the equivalence classes are the same if all nonsingular affine

close to the critical point of the composite system the inter-component
coupling makes the system behave as a single component superconductivity in
most cases. However, when the bare mean-field critical points of the two
components coincide with each other, and furthermore the inter-band coupling
disappears at the same temperature, interesting phenomena occur as follows.
Vortices interact attractively at large separation and repulsively at short
distance in certain parameter space. Because of the non-monotonic interaction
profile, phase separations between vortex clusters of triangular order and the
Meissner state take place, which indicates a first-order phase transition
associated with the penetration of the magnetic field into a superconductor
sample. Phase diagrams of vortex states are then constructed with the
associated magnetization curve. It is found that all these behavior
interpolates the features of the type I and II superconductors.

particular, we propose an appealing and economical picture in which the heavy
seesaw mediators are also messengers of SUSY breaking. In this case, strong
correlations exist among neutrino parameters, sparticle and Higgs masses, as
well as lepton flavour violating processes. Hence, this scenario can be tested
at high-energy colliders, such as the LHC, and at lower energy experiments that

compounds La0.65Ca0.35Mn1-xFexO3 with 0.01<x<0.1 have been studied. A careful
study in the magnetic properties has been carried out by the measurement of ac
susceptibility. The temperature range of CMR is greatly broadened with the
addition of Fe. Substitution of Fe induces a gradual transition from a metallic
ferromagnetic with a high Curie temperature (Tc=270 K) to a ferromagnetic
insulator with low Tc=79 K. Increased spin disorder and decrease of Tc with
increasing Fe content are evident. The variations in the critical temperature
Tc and magnetic moment show a rapid change at about 4-5% Fe. The effect of Fe
is seen to be consistent with the disruption of the Mn-Mn exchange possibly due
to the formation of magnetic clusters. An extra-ordinary behavior in the out of
phase part (x"") of ac susceptibility, characterized by double bump (shoulder),
was observed around x=0.01 and 0.02. The shoulder in x"" disappears at x>0.04 Fe
concentration. With increasing Fe concentration the x"" peak shift to T<T1/2
(mid point of the transition temperature) and becomes broader. The x"" peak
moves to 8 or 10 K higher temperature on the application of a dc field, for 3 &
4% samples. We also see increasing low temperature dissipation in more strongly
Fe doped samples i.e. increasing the Fe, leads to increased spin disorder and
dissipation at low temperature. The effect of the dc field is discussed in
terms of the suppression of spin fluctuations close to Tc. The same ionic radii
of Fe3+ and Mn3+ cause no structure changes in either series, yet
ferromagnetism has been consistently suppressed by Fe doping. Doping with Fe
bypasses the usually dominant lattice effects, but depopulate the hopping
electrons and thus weakens the double exchange. The results were explained in
terms of the formation of magnetic clusters of Fe ions.

The idea of quantum computation can be described within the limits of quantum
formalism. But in order to understand how this idea can be put into practice
one should realize the question: ""What could the quantum formalism describe?"",
in spite of the absence of an universally recognized answer. Only a realization
of this question and the undecided problem of quantum foundations allows to see
in which quantum systems the superposition and EPR correlation could be
expected. Because of the ""specialization barbarism"" many authors are sure that
Bell proved full impossibility of any hidden-variables interpretation.
Therefore it is important to emphasize that in reality Bell has restricted to
validity limits of the no- hidden-variables proof and has shown that two-state
quantum system can be described by hidden variables. The later means that no
experimental result obtained on two-state quantum system can prove the
existence of superposition and violation of the realism. One should not assume
before unambiguous experimental evidence that any two-state quantum system is
quantum bit. No experimental evidence of superposition of macroscopically
distinct quantum states and of a quantum bit on base of superconductor

depends on the cosmological constant and its first derivative with respect to
the metric. As an application, we obtain the spherical solution for the field
equations. In cosmology, the modified Friedmann equations are proposed and a
condition on ${\Lambda}$ for an accelerating universe is deduced. For a
particular case of the vector $U$, we find a decaying cosmological constant
${\Lambda}\propto a(t)^{-6{\alpha}}$.

spin-density-wave magnetic order in five different orbital models of the iron
pnictide parent compounds. A restricted mean-field ansatz is used to determine
the magnetic phase diagram of each model. Using the random phase approximation,
we then check this phase diagram by evaluating the static spin susceptibility
in the paramagnetic state close to the mean-field phase boundaries. The momenta
for which the susceptibility is peaked indicate in an unbiased way the actual
ordering vector of the nearby mean-field state. The dominant orbitally resolved
contributions to the spin susceptibility are also examined to determine the
origin of the magnetic instability. We find that the observed stripe magnetic
order is possible in four of the models, but it is extremely sensitive to the
degree of the nesting between the electron and hole Fermi pockets. In the more
realistic five-orbital models, this order competes with a strong-coupling
incommensurate state which appears to be controlled by details of the
electronic structure below the Fermi energy. We conclude by discussing the
implications of our work for the origin of the magnetic order in the pnictides.

its magnetic axis is so closely aligned with its rotation axis that its

prominence fine structure modeled as a straight and cylindrical magnetic tube
only partially filled with the prominence material, and with its ends fixed at
two rigid walls representing the solar photosphere. The prominence plasma is
partially ionized and a transverse inhomogeneous transitional layer is included
between the prominence thread and the coronal medium. Thus, ion-neutral
collisions and resonant absorption are the considered damping mechanisms.
Approximate analytical expressions of the period, the damping time, and their
ratio are derived for the fundamental mode in the thin tube and thin boundary
approximations. We find that the dominant damping mechanism is resonant
absorption, which provides damping ratios in agreement with the observations,
whereas ion-neutral collisions are irrelevant for the damping. The values of
the damping ratio are independent of both the prominence thread length and its
position within the magnetic tube, and coincide with the values for a tube
fully filled with the prominence plasma. The implications of our results in the
context of the MHD seismology technique are discussed, pointing out that the
reported short-period (2 - 10 min) and short-wavelength (700 - 8,000 km) thread
oscillations may not be consistent with a standing mode interpretation and
could be related to propagating waves. Finally, we show that the inversion of
some prominence physical parameters, e.g., Alfv\'en speed, magnetic field
strength, transverse inhomogeneity length-scale, etc., is possible using
observationally determined values of the period and damping time of the
oscillations along with the analytical approximations of these quantities.

high-density regions favoring more massive systems. Accounting for this stellar
mass-environment relation (i.e., working at fixed stellar mass), we find a
significant color-density relation for galaxies with 10.6 < log(M*/Msun) < 11.1

10.4). We conclude by discussing our results in comparison to recent works in
the literature, which report no significant correlation between galaxy
properties and environment at fixed stellar mass for the same redshift and
stellar mass domain. The non-detection of environmental dependence found in
other data sets is largely attributable to their smaller samples size and lower
sampling density, as well as systematic effects such as inaccurate redshifts
and biased analysis techniques. Ultimately, our results based on DEEP2 data
illustrate that the evolutionary state of a galaxy at z ~ 1 is not exclusively

spin density wave order. It is well known that such a metal has a
superconducting instability induced by the formation of spin-singlet pairs of
electrons, with the pairing amplitude changing sign between regions of the
Fermi surface connected by the spin density wave ordering wavevector. Here we
review recent arguments that there is an additional instability which is nearly
as strong: towards the onset of a modulated bond order which is locally an
Ising-nematic order. This new instability is a consequence of an emergent
""pseudospin"" symmetry of the low energy theory---the symmetry maps the
sign-changing pairing amplitude to the bond order parameter.

fewer baryons (gas plus stars) than the cosmic baryon fraction. This `missing
baryon' puzzle is especially surprising for the most massive clusters which are
expected to be representative of the cosmic matter content of the universe
(baryons and dark matter). Here we show that the baryons may not actually be
missing from clusters, but rather are extended to larger radii than typically
observed. The baryon deficiency is typically observed in the central regions of
clusters (~0.5 the virial radius). However, the observed gas-density profile is
significantly shallower than the mass-density profile, implying that the gas is
more extended than the mass and that the gas fraction increases with radius. We
use the observed density profiles of gas and mass in clusters to extrapolate
the measured baryon fraction as a function of radius and as a function of
cluster mass. We find that the baryon fraction reaches the cosmic value near
the virial radius for all groups and clusters above 5e13 solar masses. This
suggests that the baryons are not missing, they are simply located in cluster
outskirts. Heating processes (shock-heating of the intracluster gas, plus
supernovae and AGN feedback) that cause the gas to expand are likely
explanations for these results. Upcoming observations should be able to detect
these baryons.

best-fit by a perturbing dark sub-halo with mass one-hundredth that of the

overarching goal of this work is to attempt to outline an alternate procedure

regions trace dark matter halos with typically higher masses, which are more
correlated. If the density probability distribution function of the sample is
particularly rich in high-density regions because of the variance introduced by
its finite size, this produces a distorted two-point correlation function. We
argue that this is the dominant effect responsible for the observed ""peculiar""
clustering in the COSMOS field.

R transmitted over the forward channel, we show that the decay of the

bound for increase in the error exponent due to feedback. Furthermore, we show
that the use of feedback in this case results in an error exponent that is at

case where the feedback rate exceeds the forward rate (R_FB \geq R), we propose
a simple iterative scheme that achieves a probability of error that decays
doubly exponentially with the codeword blocklength n. More generally, for some
positive integer L, we show that a L-th order exponential error decay is
achievable if R_FB \geq (L-1)R. We prove that the above results hold whether
the feedback constraint is expressed in terms of the average feedback rate or

quantities of crystalline silicates were incorporated into the comet at
formation. We investigate the constraints that this observation places upon
protoplanetary disk physics, assuming that outward transport of particles
processed at high temperatures occurs via advection and turbulent diffusion in
an evolving disk. We also look for constraints on particle formation locations.
Our results are based upon 1D disk models that evolve with time under the
action of viscosity and photoevaporation, and track solid transport using an
ensemble of individual particle trajectories. We find that two classes of disk
model are consistent with the Stardust findings. One class features a high
particle diffusivity (a Schmidt number Sc < 1), which suffices to diffuse
particles up to 20 microns in size outward against the mean gas flow. For Sc >
1, such models are unlikely to be viable, and significant outward transport
requires that the particles of interest settle into a midplane layer that
experiences an outward gas flow. In either class of models, the mass of inner
disk material that reaches the outer disk is a strong function of the disk's
initial compactness. Hence, models of grain transport within steady-state disks
underestimate the efficiency of outward transport. Neither model results in
sustained outward transport of very large particles exceeding a mm in size. We
show that the transport efficiency generally falls off rapidly with time.
Hence, high-temperature material must be rapidly incorporated into icy bodies
to avoid fallback, and significant radial transport may only occur during the
initial phase of rapid disk evolution. It may also vary substantially between
disks depending upon their initial mass distributions. We discuss implications
for Spitzer observations of crystalline silicates in T Tauri disks.

magnetic hyperthermia applications, it is necessary to calculate the area of
their hysteresis loops in an alternating magnetic field. The three types of
theories suitable for describing the hysteresis loops of MNPs are presented and
compared to numerical simulations: equilibrium functions, Stoner-Wohlfarth
model based theories (SWMBTs) and linear response theory (LRT). Suitable
formulas to calculate the hysteresis area of major cycles are deduced from
SWMBTs and from numerical simulations; the domain of validity of the analytical
formula is explicitly studied. In the case of minor cycles, the hysteresis area
calculations are based on the LRT. A perfect agreement between LRT and
numerical simulations of hysteresis loops is obtained. The domain of validity
of the LRT is explicitly studied. Formulas to calculate the hysteresis area at
low field valid for any anisotropy of the MNP are proposed. Numerical
simulations of the magnetic field dependence of the area show it follows
power-laws with a large range of exponents. Then, analytical expressions
derived from LRT and SWMBTs are used for a theoretical study of magnetic
hyperthermia. It is shown that LRT is only pertinent for MNPs with strong
anisotropy and that SWMBTs should be used for weak anisotropy MNPs. The optimum
volume of MNPs for magnetic hyperthermia as function of material and
experimental parameters is derived. The maximum specific absorption rate (SAR)
achievable is calculated versus the MNP anisotropy. It is shown that an optimum
anisotropy increases the SAR and reduces the detrimental effects of size
distribution. The optimum anisotropy is simple to calculate and depends on the
magnetic field used in the hyperthermia experiments and on the MNP
magnetization only. The theoretical optimum parameters are compared to the one
of several magnetic materials.

classical theta functions, the action of the finite Heisenberg group, and the

these arise in the framework of the quantum group quantization of the moduli
space of flat $SU(2)$-connections on a surface, in the guise of the non-abelian
theta functions, the action of a skein algebra, and the Reshetikhin-Turaev

on the moduli space of flat $SU(2)$-connections on the torus, and using it we
deduce the existence and the formula for the Reshetikhin-Turaev representation
on the torus from quantum mechanical considerations. We show how one can derive
in a quantum mechanical setting the skein that allows handle slides, which is
the main ingredient in the construction of quantum $3$-manifold invariants.

in the quasar J102325.31+514251.0 at redshift 3.447. We measure nine C
IV(\lambda1548,1551) absorption line systems with velocities from -1400 to
-6200 km/s, and full widths at half minimum ranging from 16 to 350 km/s. We
also detect other absorption lines in these systems, including H I, C III, N V,
O VI, and Si IV. Lower ionisation lines are not present, indicating a generally
high degree of ionisation in all nine systems. The total hydrogen column
densities range from <=10^{17.2} to 10^{19.1}cm^{-2}. We examine several
diagnostics to estimate more directly the location and origin of each absorber.
Four of the systems can be attributed to a quasar-driven outflow based on line
profiles that are smooth and broad compared to thermal line widths. Several
systems also have other indicators of a quasar outflow origin, including
partial covering. Altogether there is direct evidence for 6 of the 9 systems
forming in a quasar outflow. Consistent with a near-quasar origin, eight of the
systems have metallicity values or lower limits in the range Z >= 1-8 Z_{sun}.
The lowest velocity system, which has an ambiguous location, also has the
lowest metallicity, Z <= 0.3 Z_{sun}, and might form in a non-outflow
environment farther from the quasar. Overall, however, this complex of narrow
absorption lines can be identified with a highly structured, multi-component
outflow from the quasar. The high metallicities are similar to those derived
for other quasars at similar redshifts and luminosities, and are consistent
with evolution scenarios wherein quasars appear after the main episodes of star
formation and metal enrichment in the host galaxies.

Niedermeier has called, ""the art of problem parameterization"". In this paper we
introduce and explore a novel but general form of parameterization: the number
of numbers. Several classic numerical problems, such as Subset Sum, Partition,
3-Partition, Numerical 3-Dimensional Matching, and Numerical Matching with
Target Sums, have multisets of integers as input. We initiate the study of
parameterizing these problems by the number of distinct integers in the input.
We rely on an FPT result for ILPF to show that all the above-mentioned problems
are fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized in this way. In various
applied settings, problem inputs often consist in part of multisets of integers
or multisets of weighted objects (such as edges in a graph, or jobs to be
scheduled). Such number-of-numbers parameterized problems often reduce to
subproblems about transition systems of various kinds, parameterized by the
size of the system description. We consider several core problems of this kind
relevant to number-of-numbers parameterization. Our main hardness result
considers the problem: given a non-deterministic Mealy machine M (a finite
state automaton outputting a letter on each transition), an input word x, and a
census requirement c for the output word specifying how many times each letter
of the output alphabet should be written, decide whether there exists a
computation of M reading x that outputs a word y that meets the requirement c.
We show that this problem is hard for W[1]. If the question is whether there
exists an input word x such that a computation of M on x outputs a word that
meets c, the problem becomes fixed-parameter tractable.

A_n)$ is a sequence $(x_1, \cdots, x_n)$ of $n$ distinct elements with $x_i \in
A_i$ for $1 \le i \le n$. Let $N(F)$ denote the number of SDRs of a family $F$;
two SDRs are considered distinct if they are different in at least one
component. For a nonnegative integer $t$, a family $F=(A_1,\cdots,A_n)$ is
called a $(t,n)$-family if the union of any $k\ge 1$ sets in the family
contains at least $k+t$ elements. The famous Hall's Theorem says that $N(F)\ge
1$ if and only if $F$ is a $(0,n)$-family. Denote by $M(t,n)$ the minimum
number of SDRs in a $(t,n)$-family. The problem of determining $M(t,n)$ and
those families containing exactly $M(t,n)$ SDRs was first raised by Chang
[European J. Combin.{\bf 10}(1989), 231-234]. He solved the cases when $0\le
t\le 2$ and gave a conjecture for $t\ge 3$. In this paper, we solve the
conjecture. In fact, we get a more general result for so-called valued
$(t,n)$-family.

damping Alfven waves in molecular clouds. The importance of ambipolar diffusion
on a length scale $\ell$ is governed by the ambipolar diffusion Reynolds
number, $\rad=\ell/\lad$, where $\lad$ is the characteristic length scale for
ambipolar diffusion. The logarithmic mean of the AD Reynolds number in a sample
of 15 molecular clumps with measured magnetic fields (Crutcher 1999) is 17,
comparable to the theoretically expected value. We identify several regimes of
ambipolar diffusion in a turbulent medium, depending on the ratio of the flow
time to collision times between ions and neutrals; the clumps observed by
Crutcher (1999) are all in the standard regime of ambipolar diffusion, in which
the neutrals and ions are coupled over a flow time. We have carried out
two-fluid simulations of ambipolar diffusion in isothermal, turbulent boxes for
a range of values of $\rad$. The mean Mach numbers were fixed at $\calm=3$ and
$\ma=0.67$; self-gravity was not included. We study the properties of
overdensities--i.e., clumps--in the simulation and show that the slope of the
higher-mass portion of the clump mass spectrum increases as $\rad$ decreases,
which is qualitatively consistent with Padoan et al. (2007)'s finding that the
mass spectrum in hydrodynamic turbulence is significantly steeper than in ideal
MHD turbulence. For a value of $\rad$ similar to the observed value, we find a
slope that is consistent with that of the high-mass end of the Initial Mass
Function for stars. However, the value we find for the spectral index in our
ideal MHD simulation differs from theirs, presumably because our simulations
have different initial conditions. This suggests that the mass spectrum of the
clumps in the Padoan et al. (2007) turbulent fragmentation model for the IMF
depends on the environment, which would conflict with evidence ...

to the host (R) decreases while the speed decreases for those in retrograde
orbit. At R less than 0.1 times the host virial radius the orbital speed
decreases in both prograde and retrograde orbit cases. Prograde satellites are
on average fainter than retrograde satellites for both early and late
morphological types. The u-r color becomes redder as R decreases for both
prograde and retrograde orbit late-type satellites. The differences between
prograde and retrograde orbit satellites may be attributed to their different
origin or the different strength of physical processes that they have
experienced through hydrodynamic interactions with their host galaxies.

solutions of the strong-interaction Hamiltonian with the
hyperspherical-harmonics method. The coupled-channel nature of the scattering

with either the DDH or pionless EFT model for the weak-interaction potential.
The asymmetries, predicted with PV pion and vector-meson coupling constants
corresponding (essentially) to the DDH ""best values"" set, range from -9.44 to
-2.48 in units of 10^{-8}, depending on the input strong-interaction

between long-range (pion) and short-range (vector-meson) contributions, and is
of course sensitive to the assumed values for the PV coupling constants.

stellar masses, ages, color excesses, and star formation rates of five LAEs
using SED fitting method. Assuming the constant star formation history, we find
that the stellar masses range from 10^8 to $10^{10} Msun with the median value
of 2.5x10^9 Msun. The derived ages range from very young ages (7.4 Myr) to 437
Myr with a median age of 25 Myr. The color excess E(B-V) are between 0.1-0.4

average, the LAEs show less dust extinction, and lower star formation rates
than LBGs, while the stellar mass of LAEs nearly lies in the middle part of the

show how the lifting of the orbital degeneracy by the monoclinic distortion
stabilizes C-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) state, which can be further
transformed to the G-type AFM state by changing the crystal distortion from
monoclinic to orthorhombic one. Two microscopic mechanisms of such a

plays a role in the evolution of field early-type galaxies, but less so for
those in clusters. For detection limits of a few times 10^6 Msun, HI is
detected in about 2/3 of the field galaxies, while <10% of the Virgo objects
are detected. In about half of the detections, the HI forms a regularly
rotating disc or ring. All HI discs have counterparts of ionised gas and inner
HI discs are also detected in molecular gas. The cold ISM is dominated by
molecular gas (M_H2/M_HI ~ 10). We conclude that accretion of HI is common for
field early-type galaxies, but the amount of material involved is usually
small. Cluster galaxies appear not to accrete HI. The few galaxies with a
significant young sub-population all have inner gas discs, but for the
remaining galaxies there is no trend between stellar population and HI. Some
early-type galaxies are very gas rich, but only have an old population. The
stellar populations of field galaxies are typically younger than those in
Virgo. This is likely related to differences in accretion history. In about 50%
of the galaxies we detect a central continuum source. In many objects this
emission is from a low-luminosity AGN, in some it is consistent with the
observed star formation. Galaxies with HI in the central regions are more
likely detected in continuum. This is due to a higher probability for star
formation to occur in such galaxies and not to HI-related AGN fuelling.

redshifted absorption features toward the nuclear regions of the closest
powerful radio galaxy, Centaurus A (NGC 5128). Our HI observations using the
Very Long Baseline Array allow us to discern with unprecedented sub-parsec
resolution HI absorption profiles toward different positions along the 21 cm
continuum jet emission in the inner 0.""3 (or 5.4 pc). In addition, our CO(2-1)
data obtained with the Submillimeter Array probe the bulk of the absorbing
molecular gas with little contamination by emission, not possible with previous
CO single-dish observations. We shed light with these data on the physical
properties of the gas in the line of sight, emphasizing the still open debate
about the nature of the gas that produces the broad absorption line (~55 km/s).
First, the broad H I line is more prominent toward the central and brightest 21
cm continuum component than toward a region along the jet at a distance ~ 20
mas (or 0.4 pc) further from it. This suggests that the broad absorption line
arises from gas located close to the nucleus, rather than from diffuse and more
distant gas. Second, the different velocity components detected in the CO(2-1)
absorption spectrum match well other molecular lines, such as those of
HCO+(1-0), except the broad absorption line that is detected in HCO+(1-0) (and
most likely related to that of the H I). Dissociation of molecular hydrogen due
to the AGN seems to be efficient at distances <= 10 pc, which might contribute
to the depth of the broad H I and molecular lines.

generation of phenotypic heterogeneity in the isogenic microbial population

a mycobacterial population of M. smegmatis was shown to develop phenotypic
heterogeneity under nutrient depletion. The observed heterogeneity is in the
form of a bimodal distribution of the expression levels of the Green
Fluorescent Protein (GFP) as reporter with the gfp fused to the promoter of the
rel gene. The stringent response pathway is initiated in the subpopulation with
high rel activity.In the present study, we characterize quantitatively the
single cell promoter activity of the three key genes, namely, mprA, sigE and
rel, in the stringent response pathway with gfp as the reporter. The origin of
bimodality in the GFP distribution lies in two stable expression states, i.e.,
bistability. We develop a theoretical model to study the dynamics of the
stringent response pathway. The model incorporates a recently proposed
mechanism of bistability based on positive feedback and cell growth retardation
due to protein synthesis. Based on flow cytometry data, we establish that the

other lognormal, with only the coefficients in the linear combination depending
on time. This allows us to use a binning algorithm and determine the time
variation of the mean protein level, the fraction of cells in a subpopulation

general Lema\^{\i}tre -- Tolman (L--T) model, generic light rays do not have
repeatable paths (RLPs): two rays sent from the same source at different times
to the same observer pass through different sequences of intermediate matter
particles. The only spacetimes in the Szekeres class in which {\em all} rays
are RLPs are the Friedmann models. Among the proper Szekeres models, RLPs exist
only in the axially symmetric subcases, and in each one the RLPs are the null
geodesics that intersect each $t =$ constant space on the symmetry axis. In the
special models with a 3-dimensional symmetry group (L--T among them), the only
RLPs are radial geodesics. This shows that RLPs are very special and in the
real Universe should not exist. We present several numerical examples which
suggest that the rate of change of positions of objects in the sky, for the
studied configuration, is $10^{-6} - 10^{-7}$ arc sec per year. With the
current accuracy of direction measurement, this drift would become observable
after approx. 10 years of monitoring. More precise future observations will be
able, in principle, to detect this effect, but there are basic problems with

are optimized to increase the sensitivity of global measurements- as the
frequency, response functions relative to selected electric degrees of

purely electric input and output measurements, it allows for accurate results

observe a visibility decrease in Halpha for both Rigel and Deneb, suggesting
that the line-formation region is extended (1.5-1.75 R*). We observe a
significant visibility decrease for Deneb in the SiII6371 line. We witness time
variations in the differential phase for Deneb, implying an inhomogeneous and

make the total ""Sun -climate"" relationship essentially more complicated as it
could be follow when only the TSI and GCR variations are taken into account. In
this light the climate warming tendency after AD 1975 is rather by a natural as

the general downward tendency of erruptive solar events which is superimposed
over the high long term TSI levels during the last three decades (AD

replaced by that of a continuous overlaying surface allowed to deform
tangentially to itself. Employing a variational approach, we determine
numerically the time-periodic deformation of such surface which leads to
low-Reynolds locomotion with minimum rate of energy dissipation (maximum
efficiency). Employing both Lagrangian and Eulerian points of views, we show
that in the optimal swimming stroke, individual cilia display weak asymmetric
beating, but that a significant symmetry-breaking occurs at the organism level,
with the whole surface deforming in a wave-like fashion reminiscent of
metachronal waves of biological cilia. This wave motion is analyzed using a
formal modal decomposition, is found to occur in the same direction as the
swimming direction, and is interpreted as due to a spatial distribution of
phase-differences in the kinematics of individual cilia. Using additional
constrained optimizations, as well as a constructed analytical ansatz, we
derive a complete optimization diagram where all swimming efficiencies,
swimming speeds, and amplitude of surface deformation can be reached, with the
mathematically optimal swimmer, of efficiency one half, being a singular limit.

classify young stellar objects. Of the 8,231 sources detected exhibiting
infrared excess in Cygnus X North, 670 are classified as Class I and 7,249 are
classified as Class II. Using spectra from the FAST spectrograph at the Fred L.
Whipple Observatory and Hectospec on the MMT, we spectrally typed 536 sources
in the Cygnus X complex to identify the massive stars. We find that YSOs tend
to be grouped in the neighborhoods of massive B stars (spectral types B0 to
B9). We present a minimal spanning tree analysis of clusters in two regions in
Cygnus X North. The fraction of infrared excess sources that belong to clusters
with >10 members is found to be 50--70%. Most Class II objects lie in dense
clusters within blown out HII regions, while Class I sources tend to reside in
more filamentary structures along the bright-rimmed clouds, indicating possible

decades are reanalyzed in order to characterize variability of the deep ocean
internal wavefield. The observations are discussed in the context of the
universal spectral model proposed by Garrett and Munk. The Garrett and Munk
model is a good description of wintertime conditions at Site-D on the
continental rise north of the Gulf Stream. Elsewhere and at other times,
significant deviations in terms of amplitude, separability of the 2-D vertical
wavenumber - frequency spectrum, and departure from the model's functional form
are noted. Subtle geographic patterns are apparent in deviations from the high
frequency and high vertical wavenumber power laws of the Garrett and Munk
spectrum. Moreover, such deviations tend to co-vary: whiter frequency spectra
are partnered with redder vertical wavenumber spectra. Attempts are made to
interpret the variability in terms of the interplay between generation,
propagation and nonlinearity using a statistical radiative balance equation.
This process frames major questions for future research with the insight that
such integrative studies could constrain both observationally and theoretically
based interpretations.

for the minimum vortex in SO(2N) x U(1) or USp(2N) x U(1) gauge theories, the

sulfate contaminated sandstones, followed by drying at room temperature, large
damage occurs in regions where pores are fully filled with salts. After partial
dissolution, anhydrous sodium sulfate salt present in these regions gives rise
to a very rapid growth of the hydrated phase of sulfate in the form of clusters
that form on or close to the remaining anhydrous microcrystals. The rapid
growth of these clusters generates stresses in excess of the tensile strength
of the stone leading to the damage. Sodium chloride only forms anhydrous
crystals that consequently do not cause damage in the experiments.

the theory of stochastic processes is proposed for tackling nonlinear evolution
problems. The framework, established by a series of easy-to-derive equivalences
between Green's function and stochastic representative solutions of linear
drift-diffusion problems, provides a flexible structure within which nonlinear
evolution problems can be analyzed and physically probed. As a preliminary test
bed, two canonical, nonlinear evolution problems - Burgers' equation and the
nonlinear Schrodinger's equation - are first treated. In the first case, the
framework provides a rigorous, probabilistic derivation of the well known
Cole-Hopf ansatz. Likewise, in the second, the machinery allows systematic
recovery of a known soliton solution. The framework is then applied to a fairly
extensive exploration of physical features underlying evolution of randomly
stretched and advected Burger's vortex sheets. Here, the governing vorticity
equation corresponds to the Fokker-Planck equation of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
process, a correspondence that motivates an investigation of sub-sheet
vorticity evolution and organization. Under the assumption that weak
hydrodynamic fluctuations organize disordered, near-molecular-scale, sub-sheet
vorticity, it is shown that these modes consist of two weakly damped
counter-propagating cross-sheet acoustic modes, a diffusive cross-sheet shear
mode, and a diffusive cross-sheet entropy mode. Once a consistent picture of
in-sheet vorticity evolution is established, a number of analytical results,
describing the motion and spread of single, multiple, and continuous sets of
Burger's vortex sheets, evolving within deterministic and random strain rate
fields, under both viscous and inviscid conditions, are obtained.

Kelley in 1950. Tychonov compactness is required to prove existence of the
minimiser of an action functional under standard hypotheses. Solutions to the
inviscid Burgers equation may be constructed by considering the minimising
trajectories of associated action functionals. This construction has been used
in the literature to construct an invariant measure for the stochastic inviscid
Burgers equation. This article compares results that may be obtained with and
without using this representation and draws conclusions about the Choice Axiom.

billiard will always evolve into a quantum state, whose density probability
distribution is exponential. This exponential distribution is found to be
universal for quantum chaotic systems with rigorous proof. In contrast, for the
corresponding classical system, the distribution is Gaussian. We find that the
quantum exponential distribution can smoothly change to the classical Gaussian
distribution with coarse graining.

voltage power lines cause cancer? Fuggedaboudit! No way! When pigs fly! When
I'm the Pope! Don't text while you're driving, however, or eat your cell phone.
  All organisms absorb microwave radiation directly as thermal energy. In
living organisms, the organisms' thermal control systems, including the blood
flow, and various cooling mechanisms, such as sweating in humans, that work to
maintain a stable body temperature rapidly transfer the absorbed energy to the
environment. Any temperature rise is small or even unobserved. Any proposed
mechanism by which cell phone radiation might cause cancer must begin with this
fact. But the amount of radiation absorbed from a cell phone is less than that
produced by normal metabolic processes, and much less than that produced by,
for example, exercise. None of these normal metabolic processes cause cancer.
Therefore, the much smaller amounts of energy from cell phones doesn't cause
cancer either. All forms of electromagnetic energy that are known carcinogens
are ionizing; ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays. Microwave radiation cannot
ionize any physiological molecule. In fact, microwave radiation cannot directly
break or modify any chemical bond, covalent or weak. Therefore, microwaves
cannot initiate any process leading to cancer, unless it does so through
thermal mechanisms. All chemical bonds that act in physiological processes must
operate correctly in the thermal environment of the cells at body temperature.
All of them have bond energy that is greater than that arising from the thermal
jostling, vibrating, and rotating of the cytoplasm. Energy added by microwave
radiation is more than a thousand times weaker than that present in the normal
thermal jiggling. Since the normal thermal environment does not cause cancer,
neither does any absorbed microwave radiation.
