for the universe is the presence of so called circles-in-the-sky in the cosmic

antipodal circles, have however failed to detect any. This outcome, coupled
with recent theoretical results concerning the detectability of very nearly
flat universes, is sufficient to exclude a detectable non-trivial cosmic
topology for most observers in the inflationary limit ($0< |\Omega_{tot}-1|
\lesssim 10^{-5}$). In a recent paper we have studied the consequences of these
searches for circles if the Universe turns out to be exactly flat
($\Omega_{tot} = 1 $) as is often assumed. More specifically, we have derived
the maximum angles of deviation possible from antipodicity of pairs of matching
circles associated with the shortest closed geodesic for all multiply-connected
flat orientable $3$-manifolds. These upper bounds on the deviation from
antipodicity demonstrate that in a flat universe for some classes of topology
there remains a substantial fraction of observers for whom the deviation from
antipodicity of the matching circles is considerably larger than zero, which
implies that the searches for circles-in-the-sky undertaken so far are not
enough to exclude the possibility of a detectable non-trivial flat topology.
Here we briefly review these results and discuss their consequences in the
search for circles-in-the-sky in a flat universes.

techniques that are also appropriate for other experiments. We simulate planet
observations with a Planck-like scanning strategy, telescope beams, noise, and
detector properties. Then we employ both parametric and non-parametric
techniques, reconstructing beams directly from the time-ordered data. With a
faithful parameterization of the beam shape, we can constrain certain detector
properties, such as the time constants of the detectors, to high precision.
Alternatively, we decompose the beam using an orthogonal basis. For both
techniques, we characterize the errors in the beam reconstruction with Monte
Carlo realizations. For a simplified scanning strategy, we study the impact on
estimation of the CMB power spectrum. Finally, we explore the consequences for
measuring cosmological parameters, focusing on the spectral index of primordial
scalar perturbations, n_s. The quality of the power spectrum measurement will
be significantly influenced by the optical modeling of the telescope. In our
most conservative case, using no information about the optics except the
measurement of planets, we find that a single transit of Jupiter across the
focal plane will measure the beam window functions to better than 0.3% for the
channels at 100-217 GHz that are the most sensitive to the CMB. Constraining
the beam with optical modeling can lead to much higher quality reconstruction.
Depending on the optical modeling, the beam errors may be a significant
contribution to the measurement systematics for n_s.

filaments are shown to be promising targets for indirect detection of dark

sheets of CMG are corrugated and distorted on nanometre length scales. AFM
reveals not only long range (100 nm) distortions induced by the support, as
previously observed for graphene, but also short-range corrugations with length
scales down to the resolution limit of 10 nm. These corrugations are static not
dynamic, and are significantly diminished on CMG supported on atomically smooth
substrates. Evidence for even shorter range distortions, down to a few
nanometres or less, is found by electron diffraction of suspended CMG.
Comparison of the experimental data with simulations reveals that the mean
atomic displacement from the nominal lattice position is of order 10% of the
carbon-carbon bond length. Taken together, these results suggest a complex
structure for chemically modified graphene where heterogeneous

enhance each other. The condensation of one scalar hinders any further
instabilities, unless we have a sufficiently strong repulsive interactions
between the bulk scalars. We provide both analytic arguments and numerical

that holographic orders tend to compete for attractive bulk interactions,

proportional to axial torsion squared, roll up the extra dimension into a

galaxies with 0.3<z<0.8 and I_AB<22, selected from the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift
Survey and the All-wavelength Extended Groth Strip International Survey

optically as emission-line AGNs, the rest as star-forming galaxies or
absorption-dominated galaxies. The latter are also known as ""X-ray bright,
optically normal galaxies"" (XBONGs). Analysis of the relationship between
optical emission lines and X-ray properties shows that the completeness of
optical AGN selection suffers from dependence on the star formation rate and
the quality of observed spectra. It also shows that XBONGs do not appear to be
a physically distinct population from other X-ray detected, emission-line AGNs.
On the other hand, X-ray AGN selection also has strong bias. About 2/3 of all
emission-line AGNs at L_bol>10^44 erg/s in our sample are not detected in our
200 ks Chandra images, most likely due to moderate or heavy absorption by gas
near the AGN. The 2--7 keV detection rate of Seyfert 2s at z~0.6 suggests that
their column density distribution and Compton-thick fraction are similar to
that of local Seyferts. Multiple sample selection techniques are needed to
obtain as complete a sample as possible.

one of the largest sample of nearby cluster galaxies available in the
literature. We have determined the fraction of clusters with substructure and
the properties of the galaxies located in such substructures. Substructure in
the galaxy clusters was studied using the Dressler--Shectman test, which was
calibrated through extensive Monte Carlo simulations of galaxy clusters similar
to real ones. In order to avoid possible biases in the results due to differing
incompleteness among clusters, we selected two galaxy populations: a) galaxies
brighter than M$_{r} = $-20 located in clusters at $z < 0.1$ (EC1); and b)
galaxies of brightness $M_{r} < -19$ located at $z<0.07$ (EC2). In the inner
cluster regions ($r < r_{200}$) 11$\%$ and 33$\%$ of the clusters of EC1 and
EC2 respectively show substructure. This fraction is larger in the outer
cluster regions ($\approx 55\%$) for EC1 and EC2 samples. Cluster global
properties, such as $\sigma_{c}$, $f_{b}$ or $\Delta m_{12}$ do not depend on
the amount of cluster substructure. We have studied the properties of
individual galaxies located in substructures in the EC1 and EC2 galaxy
populations. The fraction of galaxies within substructures is larger in the
outer cluster regions when fainter galaxies are included. The distribution of
relative velocities of galaxies within substructures suggest that they consist
of an infalling population mixed with backsplash galaxies. We can not rule out
that the infalling galaxy population located in substructures are genuine field

Nearby Galaxy Survey to study the relationship between atomic hydrogen (HI) and
far-ultraviolet (FUV) emission outside the optical radius (r25) in 17 spiral
and 5 dwarf galaxies. In this regime, HI is likely to represent most of the ISM
and FUV emission to trace recent star formation with little bias due to
extinction, so that the two quantities closely trace the underlying
relationship between gas and star formation rate (SFR). The azimuthally
averaged HI and FUV intensities both decline with increasing radius in this
regime, with the scale length of the FUV profile typically half that of the HI
profile. Despite the mismatch in profiles, there is a significant spatial
correlation (at 15"" resolution) between local FUV and HI intensities; near r25
this correlation is quite strong, in fact stronger than anywhere inside r25,
and shows a decline towards larger radii. The star formation efficiency (SFE) -
defined as the ratio of FUV/HI and thus the inverse of the gas depletion time -
decreases with galactocentric radius across the outer disks, though much
shallower than across the optical disks. On average, we find the gas depletion
times to be well above a Hubble time (~10^11 yr). We observe a clear
relationship between FUV/HI and HI column in the outer disks, with the SFE
increasing with increasing HI column. Despite observing systematic variations
in FUV/HI, we find no clear evidence for step-function type star formation
thresholds. When compared with results from inside r25, we find outer disk star
formation to be distinct in several ways: it is extremely inefficient
(depletion times of many Hubble times) with column densities and SFRs lower
than found anywhere inside the optical disks. It appears that the HI column is
one of, perhaps even the key environmental factor in setting the SFR in outer
galaxy disks.

and color-magnitude criteria to identify 45 stars as possible members of Wil 1.
With a systemic velocity of v_helio = -12.8 +/- 1.0 km/s, Wil 1 stars have
velocities similar to those of foreground Milky Way stars. Informed by
Monte-Carlo simulations, we identify 5 of the 45 candidate member stars as
likely foreground contaminants. We confirm a significant spread in the
abundances of the likely Wil 1 red giant branch members ([Fe/H] = -1.73 +/-
0.12 and -2.65 +/- 0.12, [Ca/Fe] = -0.4 +/- 0.18 and +0.13 +/- 0.28). This
spread supports the scenario that Wil 1 is an ultra-low luminosity dwarf galaxy
rather than a star cluster. Wil 1's innermost stars move with radial velocities
offset by 8 km/s from its outer stars and have a velocity dispersion consistent
with 0 km/s, suggesting that Wil 1 may not be in dynamical equilibrium. The
combination of the foreground contamination and unusual kinematic distribution
make it difficult to robustly determine the dark matter mass of Wil 1. As a
result, X-ray or gamma-ray observations of Wil 1 that attempt to constrain
models of particle dark matter using an equilibrium mass model are strongly
affected by the systematics in the observations presented here. We conclude
that, despite the unusual features in the Wil 1 kinematic distribution,

minimizes the stochasticity between the weighted halo distribution and its

being used in the estimator. In N-body simulations, the Poisson estimator is up
to 15 times noisier than the optimal. Implementation of the optimal weight
yields significantly lower stochasticity than weighting halos by their mass,
bias or equal. Optimal weighting could make cosmological tests based on the
matter power spectrum or cross-correlations much more powerful and/or
cost-effective. A volume-limited measurement of the mass power spectrum at
k=0.2h/Mpc over the entire z<1 universe could ideally be done using only 6
million redshifts of halos with mass M>6\times10^{13}h^{-1}M_\odot
(1\times10^{13}) at z=0 (z=1); this is 5 times fewer than the Poisson model
predicts. Using halo occupancy distributions (HOD) we find that
uniformly-weighted catalogs of luminous red galaxies require >3 times more
redshifts than an optimally-weighted halo catalog to reconstruct the mass to
the same accuracy. While the mean HODs of galaxies above a threshold luminosity
are similar to the optimal w(M), the stochasticity of the halo occupation
degrades the mass estimator. Blue or emission-line galaxies are about 100 times
less efficient at reconstructing mass than an optimal weighting scheme. This
suggests an efficient observational approach of identifying and weighting halos
with a deep photo-z survey before conducting a spectroscopic survey. The
optimal w(M) and mass-estimator stochasticity predicted by the standard halo

Type Ia and Type II supernovae, radiation pressure, and inflow to the central
BH from mildly rotating galactic gas which is being replenished as a normal
consequence of stellar evolution. The central BH accretes some of the infalling
gas and expels a conical wind with mass, momentum, and energy flux derived from
both observational and theoretical studies. The galaxy is assumed to have low
specific angular momentum in analogy with the existing one-dimensional case in
order to isolate the effect of dimensionality. The code then tracks the
interaction of the outflowing radiation and winds with the galactic gas and
their effects on regulating the accretion. After matching physical modeling to
the extent possible between the one-dimensional and two-dimensional treatments,
we find essentially similar results in terms of BH growth and duty cycle
(fraction of the time above a given fraction of the Eddington luminosity). In
the two-dimensional calculations, the cool shells forming at 0.1--1 kpc from

somewhat higher accretion rate, less effective feedback, and a more irregular

combinations of open-world ontology languages with closed-world (non-monotonic)
rule paradigms. The definition of Hybrid MKNF is parametric on the description
logic (DL) underlying the ontology language, in the sense that non-monotonic
rules can extend any decidable DL language. Two related semantics have been
defined for Hybrid MKNF: one that is based on the Stable Model Semantics for
logic programs and one on the Well-Founded Semantics (WFS). Under WFS, the
definition of Hybrid MKNF relies on a bottom-up computation that has polynomial
data complexity whenever the DL language is tractable. Here we define a general
query-driven procedure for Hybrid MKNF that is sound with respect to the stable
model-based semantics, and sound and complete with respect to its WFS variant.
This procedure is able to answer a slightly restricted form of conjunctive
queries, and is based on tabled rule evaluation extended with an external
oracle that captures reasoning within the ontology. Such an (abstract) oracle
receives as input a query along with knowledge already derived, and replies
with a (possibly empty) set of atoms, defined in the rules, whose truth would
suffice to prove the initial query. With appropriate assumptions on the
complexity of the abstract oracle, the general procedure maintains the data
complexity of the WFS for Hybrid MKNF knowledge bases.
  To illustrate this approach, we provide a concrete oracle for EL+, a fragment
of the light-weight DL EL++. Such an oracle has practical use, as EL++ is the
language underlying OWL 2 EL, which is part of the W3C recommendations for the
Semantic Web, and is tractable for reasoning tasks such as subsumption. We show
that query-driven Hybrid MKNF preserves polynomial data complexity when using
the EL+ oracle and WFS.

Operator Theory, 69(1): 135-159, 2013",,,"math.OA math.FA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper studies the ""energy space"" $\mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{E}}$ (the
Hilbert space of functions of finite energy, aka the Dirichlet-finite
functions) on an infinite network (weighted connected graph), from the point of
view of the multiplication operators $M_f$ associated to functions $f$ on the
network. We show that the multiplication operators $M_f$ are not Hermitian
unless $f$ is constant, and compute the adjoint $M_f^\star$ in terms of a
reproducing kernel for $\mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{E}}$.
  A characterization of the bounded multiplication operators is given in terms
of positive semidefinite functions, and we give some conditions on $f$ which
ensure $M_f$ is bounded. Examples show that it is not sufficient that $f$ be
bounded or have finite energy. Conditions for the boundedness of $M_f$ are also
expressed in terms of the behavior of the simple random walk on the network.
  We also consider the bounded elements of $\mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{E}}$ and the
(possibly unbounded) multiplication operators corresponding to them. In a
previous paper, the authors used functional integration to construct a type of
boundary for infinite networks. The boundary is described here in terms of a
certain subalgebra of these multiplication operators, and is shown to embed
into the Gel'fand space of that subalgebra. In the case when the only harmonic
functions of finite energy are constant, we show that the Gel'fand space is the
1-point compactification of the underlying network.

in which every pair of terminals observes correlated sources that are
independent of sources observed by all other pairs of terminals. The terminals
are then allowed to communicate publicly with all such communication being
observed by all the terminals. The objective is to generate a secret key shared
by a given subset of terminals at the largest rate possible, with the
cooperation of any remaining terminals. Secrecy is required from an
eavesdropper that has access to the public interterminal communication. A
(single-letter) formula for secret key capacity brings out a natural connection
between the problem of secret key generation and a combinatorial problem of
maximal packing of Steiner trees in an associated multigraph. An explicit
algorithm is proposed for secret key generation based on a maximal packing of
Steiner trees in a multigraph; the corresponding maximum rate of Steiner tree
packing is thus a lower bound for the secret key capacity. When only two of the
terminals or when all the terminals seek to share a secret key, the mentioned
algorithm achieves secret key capacity in which case the bound is tight.

have extensive multi-wavelength coverage and are easily accessible from ALMA.
Two thirds of the of the sources are expected to be at z > 1, one third at z >
2 and about a 1000 at z > 5. (b) Remove point source confusion in secondary
anisotropy studies with Planck and ground-based CMB data. (c) Find at least
1200 strongly lensed bright sub-mm sources leading to a 2% test of general
relativity. (d) Identify 200 proto-cluster regions at z of 2 and perform an
unbiased study of the environmental dependence of star formation. (e) Perform
an unbiased survey for star formation and dust at high Galactic latitude and
make a census of debris disks and dust around AGB stars and white dwarfs.

evolution. Close groupings, like the cores of galaxy clusters or compact
groups, evolve in ways far more dramatic than their isolated counterparts. We
have conducted a multiwavelength study of HCG7, consisting of four giant
galaxies: 3 spirals and 1 lenticular. We use Hubble Space Telescope (HST)
imaging to identify and characterize the young and old star cluster
populations. We find young massive clusters (YMC) mostly in the three spirals,
while the lenticular features a large, unimodal population of globular clusters
(GC) but no detectable clusters with ages less than ~Gyr. The spatial and
approximate age distributions of the ~300 YMCs and ~150 GCs thus hint at a
regular star formation history in the group over a Hubble time. While at first
glance the HST data show the galaxies as undisturbed, our deep ground-based,
wide-field imaging that extends the HST coverage reveals faint signatures of
stellar material in the intra-group medium. We do not detect the intra-group
medium in HI or Chandra X-ray observations, signatures that would be expected
to arise from major mergers. We find that the HI gas content of the individual
galaxies and the group as a whole are a third of the expected abundance. The
appearance of quiescence is challenged by spectroscopy that reveals an intense
ionization continuum in one galaxy nucleus, and post-burst characteristics in
another. Our spectroscopic survey of dwarf galaxy members yields one dwarf
elliptical in an apparent tidal feature. We therefore suggest an evolutionary
scenario for HCG7, whereby the galaxies convert most of their available gas
into stars without major mergers and result in a dry merger. As the conditions
governing compact groups are reminiscent of galaxies at intermediate redshift,
we propose that HCGs are appropriate for studying galaxy evolution at z~1-2.

low but can still be extracted using the fluctuation-dissipation theorem over
the entire trap range as long as the local density approximation remains valid,

their numbers through ionizing radiation, supernova explosions, and heavy
element production. Their formation requires the collapse of massive
interstellar gas clouds with very high accretion rates. We discuss results from
the first three-dimensional simulations of the gravitational collapse of a
massive, rotating molecular cloud core that include heating by both
non-ionizing and ionizing radiation. Local gravitational instabilities in the
accretion flow lead to the build-up of a small cluster of stars. These
lower-mass companions subsequently compete with the high-mass star for the same
common gas reservoir and limit its overall mass growth. This process is called
fragmentation-induced starvation, and explains why massive stars are usually
found as members of high-order stellar systems. These simulations also show
that the HII regions forming around massive stars are initially trapped by the
infalling gas, but soon begin to fluctuate rapidly. Over time, the same
ultracompact HII region can expand anisotropically, contract again, and take on
any of the observed morphological classes. The total lifetime of HII regions is
given by the global accretion timescale, rather than their short internal
sound-crossing time. This solves the so-called lifetime problem of ultracompact
HII region. We conclude that the the most significant differences between the
formation of low-mass and high-mass stars are all explained as the result of
rapid accretion within a dense, gravitationally unstable flow.

phase of relaxor ferroelectrics. The PNR is assumed to be a ferroelectric
sphere embedded in the host isotropic medium. The Lagrangian parameters are
taken to be the same inside and outside the PNR, with exception of the
soft-mode gap temperature dependence. The interaction of the Transverse (TO)
with the longitudinal (LO) optic modes is taken into account but the latter is
found to be important only at the surface of the PNR. Elementary excitations of
the system are found to be of two types - Vortex (V) and Quasi Polar (QP). V
excitations correspond to closed polarization lines or closed TO displacements
while QP excitations contain open TO polarization lines, with an electric
dipole if the net angular momentum j=1. LO waves are virtually excited only in
the thin layer near the PNR surface and can be excluded from the boundary
conditions without any consequence. The final boundary conditions include only
V and QP TO wave amplitudes. Dynamical equations are solved and a phase diagram
is predicted. The phase transition temperature is found to be lower for Vortex
than for QP excitations. Therefore, the QP condensation (local phase
transition) occurs before the Vortex one upon cooling. TO scattering by the PNR
reveals strong long-wave resonances that can be shown to result from shallow
localized and quasi-localized states and may be essential to understanding the
waterfall observed in TO studies by inelastic neutron scattering.

valuations have a public and a private component. In particular, we consider
combinatorial auctions where the valuation of an agent $i$ for a set $S$ of
items can be expressed as $v_if(S)$, where $v_i$ is a private single parameter
of the agent, and the function $f$ is publicly known. Our motivation behind
studying this problem is two-fold: (a) Such valuation functions arise naturally
in the case of ad-slots in broadcast media such as Television and Radio. For an
ad shown in a set $S$ of ad-slots, $f(S)$ is, say, the number of {\em unique}
viewers reached by the ad, and $v_i$ is the valuation per-unique-viewer. (b)
From a theoretical point of view, this factorization of the valuation function
simplifies the bidding language, and renders the combinatorial auction more
amenable to better approximation factors. We present a general technique, based
on maximal-in-range mechanisms, that converts any $\alpha$-approximation
non-truthful algorithm ($\alpha \leq 1$) for this problem into
$\Omega(\frac{\alpha}{\log{n}})$ and $\Omega(\alpha)$-approximate truthful
mechanisms which run in polynomial time and quasi-polynomial time,

the quantum states during the build up of the quasi-equilibrium state in 5CB
prepared under the S condition is similar to the case of adamantane and that
their quasi-equilibrium density operators have the same tensor structure. In
contrast, the second constant of motion, whose explicit operator form is not
known, involves a richer composition of multiple quantum coherences on the X
basis of even order, in consistency with the truncation inherent in its
definition. We exploited the exclusive presence coherences 4, 6, 8, besides 0
and 2 under the W condition to measure the spin-lattice relaxation time T_{W}
accurately, so avoiding experimental difficulties that usually impair dipolar
order relaxation measurement such as Zeeman contamination at high fields, and
also superposition of the different quasiinvariants. This procedure opens the
possibility of measuring the spin-lattice relaxation of a quasiinvariant
independent of the Zeeman and S reservoirs, so incorporating a new relaxation
parameter useful for studying the complex molecular dynamics in mesophases. In
fact, we report the first measurement of T_{W} in a liquid crystal at high
magnetic fields. The comparison of the obtained value with the one
corresponding to a lower field (16 MHz) points out that the relaxation of the
W-order strongly depends on the intensity of the external magnetic field,
similarly to the case of the S reservoir, indicating that the relaxation of the

they are used here on formal pseudo-differential operators in order to get a

possess them in combination with the rotation reversal symmetry. Similarly, we
show that many antidistorted perovskites possess twice the number of symmetry

piezorotation, and rotomagnetism. They also enable symmetry-based search for

A
typical example is the voltage transitions between up and down states observed

biologically motivated stochastic model of up and down transitions. The model
is constituted by a simple bistable rate model, where the synaptic current is
modulated by short-term synaptic processes which introduce stochasticity and
temporal correlations. A complete analysis of our model, both with mean-field
approaches and numerical simulations, shows the appearance of complex
transitions between high (up) and low (down) neural activity states, driven by
the synaptic noise, with permanence times in the up state distributed according
to a power-law. We show that the experimentally observed large fluctuation in
up and down permanence times can be explained as the result of sufficiently
noisy dynamical synapses with sufficiently large recovery times. Static
synapses cannot account for this behavior, nor can dynamical synapses in the
absence of noise.

penalized manifold learning based dimensionality reduction is not directly a

learning, cannot be applied. Therefore, most current approaches take indirect
ways or have strict settings, which can be inconvenient for applications. In
this paper, we proposed the manifold elastic net or MEN for short. MEN
incorporates the merits of both the manifold learning based dimensionality
reduction and the sparse learning based dimensionality reduction. By using a
series of equivalent transformations, we show MEN is equivalent to the lasso
penalized least square problem and thus LARS is adopted to obtain the optimal
sparse solution of MEN. In particular, MEN has the following advantages for
subsequent classification: 1) the local geometry of samples is well preserved
for low dimensional data representation, 2) both the margin maximization and
the classification error minimization are considered for sparse projection
calculation, 3) the projection matrix of MEN improves the parsimony in
computation, 4) the elastic net penalty reduces the over-fitting problem, and
5) the projection matrix of MEN can be interpreted psychologically and
physiologically. Experimental evidence on face recognition over various popular
datasets suggests that MEN is superior to top level dimensionality reduction
algorithms.

expression of the protein neuroglobin protects neurons in vitro, in animal

insult. However, until now, the exact mechanism of neuroglobin's protective
action has not been determined. Using cell biology and biochemical approaches
we demonstrate that neuroglobin inhibits the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis in
vitro and intervenes in activation of pro-caspase 9 by interaction with
cytochrome c. Using systems level information of the apoptotic signalling
reactions we have developed a quantitative model of neuroglobin inhibition of
apoptosis, which simulates neuroglobin blocking of apoptosome formation at a
single cell level. Furthermore, this model allows us to explore the effect of
neuroglobin in conditions not easily accessible to experimental study. We found
that the protection of neurons by neuroglobin is very concentration sensitive.
The impact of neuroglobin may arise from both its binding to cytochrome c and
its subsequent redox reaction, although the binding alone is sufficient to
block pro-caspase 9 activation. These data provides an explanation the action
of neuroglobin in the protection of nerve cells from unwanted apoptosis.

develop a model of Bcl-2 inhibition of apoptosis. Our results clarify how Bcl-2
imparts its anti-apoptotic role by increasing the time-to-death and
cell-to-cell variability. We also show that although the commitment to death is
highly impacted by differences in protein levels at the time of stimulation,
inherent stochastic fluctuations in apoptotic signaling are sufficient to
induce cell-to-cell variability and to allow single cells to escape death. This
study suggests that intrinsic cell-to-cell stochastic variability in apoptotic
signaling is sufficient to cause fractional killing of cancer cells after
exposure to BH3 mimetics. This is an unanticipated facet of cancer

C_1, but her transmissions also reach an eavesdropper Eve through another
channel C_2. The goal is to design a coding scheme that makes it possible for
Alice to communicate both reliably and securely. Reliability is measured in
terms of Bob's probability of error in recovering the message, while security
is measured in terms of the mutual information between the message and Eve's
observations. Wyner showed that the situation is characterized by a single
constant C_s, called the secrecy capacity, which has the following meaning: for
all $\epsilon > 0$, there exist coding schemes of rate $R \ge C_s - \epsilon$
that asymptotically achieve both the reliability and the security objectives.
However, his proof of this result is based upon a nonconstructive random-coding
argument. To date, despite a considerable research effort, the only case where
we know how to construct coding schemes that achieve secrecy capacity is when
Eve's channel C_2 is an erasure channel, or a combinatorial variation thereof.
  Polar codes were recently invented by Arikan; they approach the capacity of
symmetric binary-input discrete memoryless channels with low encoding and
decoding complexity. Herein, we use polar codes to construct a coding scheme
that achieves the secrecy capacity of general wiretap channels. Our
construction works for any instantiation of the wiretap channel model, as
originally defined by Wyner, as long as both C_1 and C_2 are symmetric and
binary-input. Moreover, we show how to modify our construction in order to
achieve strong security, as defined by Maurer, while still operating at a rate
that approaches the secrecy capacity. In this case, we cannot guarantee that
the reliability condition will be satisfied unless the main channel C_1 is
noiseless, although we believe it can be always satisfied in practice.

pinning induced by an antiferromagnet through exchange anisotropy. Using
coplanar waveguide ferromagnetic resonance, pinning of the lowest energy spin
wave thickness mode in Ni(80)Fe(20)/Ir(25)Mn(75) exchange biased bilayers was
studied for a range of IrMn thicknesses. We show that pinning of the standing
mode can be used to amplify, relative to the fundamental resonance, frequency
shifts associated with exchange bias. The shifts provide a unique `fingerprint'
of the exchange bias and can be interpreted in terms of an effective
ferromagnetic film thickness and ferromagnet/antiferromagnet interface
anisotropy. Thermal effects are studied for ultra-thin antiferromagnetic
Ir(25)Mn(75) thicknesses, and the onset of bias is correlated with changes in
the pinning fields. The pinning strength magnitude is found to grow with
cooling of the sample, while the effective ferromagnetic film thickness
simultaneously decreases. These results suggest that exchange bias involves
some deformation of magnetic order in the interface region.

intergalactic medium (IGM) will become an important constraint on models of the
formation and evolution of the earliest galaxies, the properties of the first
stars, and the reionization and enrichment of the IGM. The first measurement of
a metal abundance in the IGM at a redshift approaching the epoch of
reionization already offers intriguing hints. Between z=5.8 and 4.7 (a 0.3 Gyr
interval only 1 Gyr after the big bang), the measured density of CIV absorbers
in the IGM increased by a factor of ~ 3.5 (Ryan-Weber et al. 2009; Becker,
Rauch & Sargent 2009). If these values prove to be accurate, they pose two
puzzles: (1) The total amount of CIV at z=5.8 implies too little star formation
to reionize the IGM by z=6 or to match the WMAP electron scattering optical
depth (tau). (2) The rapid growth from z = 6-5 is faster than the buildup of
stellar mass or the increase in the star formation rate density over the same
interval. We show that a delay of ~ 0.4-0.7 Gyr between the instantaneous
production of ionizing photons and the later production of metal absorption
features (added to the delay due to stellar lifetimes) can provide the full
explanation for both puzzles. We calculate the delay in metal production due to
finite stellar lifetimes alone and find that it is too short to explain the
rapid CIV density increase. The additional delay could naturally be explained
as the result of ~ 200 km/s outflows carrying carbon to distances of ~ 100 kpc,
the typical distance between galaxies and CIV absorbers in enrichment
simulations, and the typical outflow or absorption region scale observed at z ~
2-3.

phenomena among neighbouring pores and related micro-filtration phenomena by
means of a continuum microstructured model. The main idea is to extend the
classical macroscopic Biot model by including in the description second
gradient effects. This is done by assuming that the surface contribution to the
external work rate functional depends on the normal derivative of the velocity
or equivalently assuming that the strain work rate functional depends on the
porosity and strain gradients. According to classical thermodynamics suitable
restrictions for stresses and second gradient internal actions (hyperstresses)
are recovered, so as to determine a suitable extended form of the constitutive
relation and Darcy's law. Finally a numerical application of the envisaged
model to one-dimensional consolidation is developed; the obtained results
generalize those by Terzaghi; in particular interesting phenomena occurring

their dark matter halos were found to be 13 times denser than those of spirals

were taken with the 9.2m Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) in identical conditions

and internal calibration we achieved a relative flux accuracy of better than
1%. The rms profiles of the very broad Balmer lines have shapes that differ
from their mean line profiles, consisting of two inner (v $\lesssim \pm{}$ 6000
km s$^{-1}$) and two outer (v $\gtrsim \pm{}$ 6000 km s$^{-1}$) line components
in addition to a central component (v $\lesssim \pm{}$ 600 km s$^{-1}$). These
outer and inner line segments varied with different amplitudes during our
campaign. The radius of the BLR is very small with an upper limit of 2
light-days for the H$\beta$ BLR size. We derived an upper limit to the central
black hole mass of $ M= 11.2 \times 10^{7} M_{\odot} $. The 2-D
cross-correlation functions CCF($\tau$,$v$) of H$\beta$ and H$\alpha$ are flat

to continuum variations is different in the outer and inner wings of H$\alpha$

conclude that the outer and inner line segments originate in different regions

gaps, others indicate strong anisotropy and yet others suggest gap zeros
(""nodes""). Theoretical models also vary, suggesting that the absence or
presence of the nodes depends quantitatively on the model parameters. An
opinion that has gained substantial currency is that the gap structure, unlike
all other known superconductors, including cuprates, may be different in
different compounds within the same family. A unique method for addressing this
issue, one of the very few methods that are bulk and angle-resolved, calls for
measuring the electronic specific heat in a rotating magnetic field, as a
function of field orientation with respect to the crystallographic axes. In
this Communication we present the first such measurement for an Fe-based
high-Tc superconductor (FeBSC). We observed a fourfold oscillation of the
specific heat as a function of the in-plane magnetic field direction, which
allowed us to identify the locations of the gap minima (or nodes) on the Fermi
surface. Our results are consistent with the expectations of an extended s-wave
model with a significant gap anisotropy on the electron pockets and the gap
minima along the \Gamma M (or Fe-Fe bond) direction.

accompanied by the step-wise variation of interplane distance governed by space

of tic-tac-toe, by allowing superpositions of classical moves. In order for the
quantum game to reduce properly to the classical game, we require legal quantum
moves to be orthogonal to all previous moves. We also admit interference
effects, by squaring the sum of amplitudes over all moves by a player to
compute his or her occupation level of a given site. A player wins when the
sums of occupations along any of the eight straight lines we can draw in the $3
\times 3$ grid is greater than three. We play the quantum tic-tac-toe first
randomly, and then deterministically, to explore the impact different opening
moves, end games, and different combinations of offensive and defensive
strategies have on the outcome of the game. In contrast to the classical
tic-tac-toe, the deterministic quantum game does not always end in a draw. In
contrast also to most classical two-player games of no chance, it is possible
for Player 2 to win. More interestingly, we find that Player 1 enjoys an
overwhelming quantum advantage when he opens with a quantum move, but loses
this advantage when he opens with a classical move. We also find the quantum
blocking move, which consists of a weighted superposition of moves that the
opponent could use to win the game, to be very effective in denying the
opponent his or her victory. We then speculate what implications these results
might have on quantum information transfer and portfolio optimization.

to linear packing constraints. An instance of this problem consists of a matrix
$A \in [0,1]^{m \times n}$, a vector $b \in [1,\infty)^m$, and a monotone
submodular set function $f: 2^{[n]} \rightarrow \bbR_+$. The objective is to
find a set $S$ that maximizes $f(S)$ subject to $A x_{S} \leq b$, where $x_S$
stands for the characteristic vector of the set $S$. A well-studied special
case of this problem is when $f$ is linear. This special case captures the
class of packing integer programs.
  Our main contribution is an efficient combinatorial algorithm that achieves
an approximation ratio of $\Omega(1 / m^{1/W})$, where $W = \min\{b_i / A_{ij}
: A_{ij} > 0\}$ is the width of the packing constraints. This result matches
the best known performance guarantee for the linear case. One immediate
corollary of this result is that the algorithm under consideration achieves
constant factor approximation when the number of constraints is constant or
when the width of the constraints is sufficiently large. This motivates us to
study the large width setting, trying to determine its exact approximability.
We develop an algorithm that has an approximation ratio of $(1 - \epsilon)(1 -
1/e)$ when $W = \Omega(\ln m / \epsilon^2)$. This result essentially matches
the theoretical lower bound of $1 - 1/e$. We also study the special setting in
which the matrix $A$ is binary and $k$-column sparse. A $k$-column sparse
matrix has at most $k$ non-zero entries in each of its column. We design a fast
combinatorial algorithm that achieves an approximation ratio of $\Omega(1 /
(Wk^{1/W}))$, that is, its performance guarantee only depends on the sparsity
and width parameters.

contribution which is of the same order as the spin exchange interaction. In a
first perturbative analysis we identify a regime of negative differential
conductance and a cascade resonance in the presence of an external magnetic
field, which both originate from the non-equilibrium occupation of the

the PG structures observed in the range of 50 cm-1 - 150 cm-1 in optical

long been around, other path estimators, or decoders, have been either only
hinted at or applied more recently and in dedicated applications generally
unfamiliar to the statistical learning community. Over a decade ago, however, a
family of algorithmically defined decoders aiming to hybridize the two standard
ones was proposed (Brushe et al., 1998). The present paper gives a careful
analysis of this hybridization approach, identifies several problems and issues
with it and other previously proposed approaches, and proposes practical
resolutions of those. Furthermore, simple modifications of the classical
criteria for hidden path recognition are shown to lead to a new class of
decoders. Dynamic programming algorithms to compute these decoders in the usual
forward-backward manner are presented. A particularly interesting subclass of
such estimators can be also viewed as hybrids of the MAP and PD estimators.
Similar to previously proposed MAP-PD hybrids, the new class is parameterized
by a small number of tunable parameters. Unlike their algorithmic predecessors,
the new risk-based decoders are more clearly interpretable, and, most
importantly, work ""out of the box"" in practice, which is demonstrated on some
real bioinformatics tasks and data. Some further generalizations and
applications are discussed in conclusion.

superimposed to its thermal spectrum. Interestingly enough, a faint
optical/infrared source was proposed as a possible counterpart to 1E
1207.4-5209, but later questioned, based on coarse positional coincidence.
Considering the large offset of 1E 1207.4-5209 with respect to the center of
its host supernova remnant, the source should move at ~70 mas/yr. Thus, we
tested the association by measuring the proper motion of the proposed optical
counterpart. Using HST observations spanning 3.75 years, we computed a 3 sigma
upper limit of 7 mas/yr. Absolute astrometry on the same HST data set also
places the optical source significantly off the 99% confidence Chandra
position. This allows us to safely rule out the association. Using the HST data
set, coupled to ground-based observations collected at the ESO/VLT, we set the
deepest limits ever obtained to the optical/infrared emission from 1E
1207.4-5209. By combining such limits to the constraints derived from X-ray
timing, we rule out accretion as the source of the thermal anisotropy of the

Interactions among agents are specified by complex topologies, and we consider
both homogeneous and heterogeneous situations. We consider deterministic and
stochastic update rules for the strategies, which in turn may consider single
links or full context when selecting agents to copy from. Our results indicate
that the co-evolutionary process preserves heterogeneous networks as a suitable
framework for the emergence of cooperation. Furthermore, on those networks, the
update rule leading to a larger fraction, which we call replicator dynamics, is
selected during co-evolution. On homogeneous networks we observe that even if
replicator dynamics turns out again to be the selected update rule, the
cooperation level is larger than on a fixed update rule framework. We conclude
that for a variety of topologies, the fact that the dynamics coevolves with the
strategies leads in general to more cooperation in the weak Prisoner's Dilemma

of any observable of the system. However, the inverse problem of determining
the state by performing different measurements is not a trivial task. In
various experimental setups it is reasonably straightforward to reconstruct the
state of a quantum system employing linear tomographic technique. In this way
the elements of the density matrix can be linearly related to a set of measured
quantities. But since different observables of a quantum system are not
commuting with each other, one often has to perform series of successive
measurements of observables which cannot be done simultaneously. Simultaneous
measurement of observables cost less time and energy and is more beneficial. In
this paper we review the strategy of quantum state tomography with simultaneous
measurement of commuting observables. This can be done by introducing an
assistant system of which the state is known. We show that the interaction
between the assistant and the system of interest within different frame works
allows the reconstruction of the state of the system. Specifically, we consider
a two-level system and reconstruct its initial state by introducing an
assistant which can be either another two-level system or a single cavity mode

recent radial velocity measurements obtained with the echelle spectrograph on
the Magellan-Clay telescope. We observe significant velocity variability of the
UV emission, and we find that the O VI and N V emission velocities follow the
optical velocity curve of the XRB. Moreover, the O VI and N V intensities
regularly decrease between binary phase = 0.5 and 1.0, which suggests that the
source of the UV emission is increasingly occulted as the B star in the XRB
moves from superior to inferior conjunction. These trends suggest that
illumination of the B-star atmosphere by the intense X-ray emission from the
accreting black hole creates a hot spot on one side of the B star, and this hot
spot is the origin of the O VI and N V emission. However, the velocity
semiamplitude of the ultraviolet emission, K_{UV}~180 km/s, is lower than the
optical semiamplitude; this difference could be due to rotation of the B star.
If our hypothesis about the origin of the highly ionized emission is correct,
then careful analysis of the emission occultation could, in principle,
constrain the inclination of the XRB and the mass of the black hole.

right-handed neutrinos whose Majorana mass parameters arise from the vacuum

Majorana fermions, all Yukawa couplings can be expressed as functions of the

This is to be contrasted to the case of charged-fermions or Dirac neutrinos,
where couplings to the Higgs-boson are diagonal in the mass basis and
proportional only to the fermion masses. Nonetheless, all physically
distinguishable parameters can be reached if all neutrino masses are
constrained to be positive, all mixing angles constrained to lie in the first

centered at 150, 250, and 410 GHz, with 768, 384, and 280 detectors in each
band, respectively. This broad frequency coverage is designed to provide
valuable information about polarized foreground signals from dust. The
polarized sky signals will be modulated with an achromatic half wave plate
(AHWP) rotating on a superconducting magnetic bearing (SMB) and analyzed with a
fixed wire grid polarizer. EBEX will observe a patch covering ~1% of the sky
with 8' resolution, allowing for observation of the angular power spectrum from
\ell = 20 to 1000. This will allow EBEX to search for both the primordial
B-mode signal predicted by inflation and the anticipated lensing B-mode signal.
Calculations to predict EBEX constraints on r using expected noise levels show
that, for a likelihood centered around zero and with negligible foregrounds,
99% of the area falls below r = 0.035. This value increases by a factor of 1.6
after a process of foreground subtraction. This estimate does not include

channels. Consider a fully connected $n$-user Gaussian interference channel. At
each time instance only $K\leq n$ transmitters are allowed to be communicating
with their respective receivers and the remaining $(n-K)$ transmitter-receiver
pairs remain inactive. For finite $n$, if the transmitters can acquire channel
state information (CSI) and if all channel gains are bounded away from zero and
infinity, the seminal results on interference alignment establish that for any
$K$ {\em arbitrary} active pairs the total number of spatial degrees of freedom
per orthogonal time and frequency domain is $\frac{K}{2}$. Also it is
noteworthy that without transmit-side CSI the interference channel becomes
interference-limited and the degrees of freedom is 0. In {\em dense} networks
($n\rightarrow\infty$), however, as the size of the network increase, it
becomes less likely to sustain the bounding conditions on the channel gains. By
exploiting this fact, we show that when $n$ obeys certain scaling laws, by {\em
opportunistically} and {\em dynamically} selecting the $K$ active pairs at each
time instance, the number of degrees of freedom can exceed $\frac{K}{2}$ and in
fact can be made arbitrarily close to $K$. More specifically when all
transmitters and receivers are equipped with one antenna, then the network size
scaling as $n\in\omega(\snr^{d(K-1)})$ is a {\em sufficient} condition for
achieving $d\in[0,K]$ degrees of freedom. Moreover, achieving these degrees of
freedom does not necessitate the transmitters to acquire channel state
information. Hence, invoking opportunistic communication in the context of
interference channels leads to achieving higher degrees of freedom that are not
achievable otherwise.

monitoring of social interactions, uncovering similarities in the way
individuals interact in different contexts, and identifying patterns of
super-connector behavior in the community. These results could impact our
understanding of all phenomena driven by face-to-face interactions, such as the
spreading of transmissible infectious diseases and information.

Alto Telescope. Its objective is finding habitable exoplanets around M dwarfs
through radial velocity measurements (m/s level) in the near-infrared.
Consequently, the NIR spectrograph is highly constraint regarding
thermal/mechanical requirements. As a first approach, the thermal stability has
been limited to \pm 0.01K (within year period) over a working temperature of
243K. This can be achieved by means of several temperature-controlled rooms.
The options considered to minimise the complexity of the thermal design are
here presented, as well as the transient-state thermal analyses realised to
make the best choice.

the electronic and vibrational state of an ion, representing the discrete and
continuous components of relativistic wave functions. Multiple laser fields and
an auxiliary ion simulate the dynamics generated by the Dirac equation in the
presence of a scattering potential. Measurement and reconstruction of the
particle wave packet enables a frame-by-frame visualization of the scattering
processes. By precisely engineering a range of external potentials we are able
to simulate text book relativistic scattering experiments and study Klein
tunneling in an analogue quantum simulator. We describe extensions to solve
problems that are beyond current classical computing capabilities.

axial C_5^A nucleon-to-Delta form factor, and due to the relevance of this form
factor for neutrino induced coherent pion production, we re-evaluate our model
predictions in Phys. Rev. D79, 013002 (2009) for different observables of the
latter reaction. Central values for the total cross sections increase by 20% to
30%, while differential cross sections do not change their shape appreciably.
Furthermore, we also compute the uncertainties on total, differential and flux
averaged cross sections induced by the errors in the determination of C_5^A.
Our new results turn out to be compatible within about 1 sigma with the former
ones. Finally, we stress the existing tension between the recent experimental
determination of the sigma(CC coh \pi^+)/sigma(NC coh \pi^0) ratio by the
SciBooNE Collaboration and the theoretical predictions.

detector. A promising theory of the dominant emission process is the coherent
synchrotron radiation emitted by e+ e- shower particles in the Earth's magnetic
field (geosynchrotron effect). A radio air shower detector can extend IceTop,
the air shower detector on top of IceCube. This could increase the sensitivity
of IceTop to higher shower energies and for inclined showers significantly.
Muons from air showers are a major part of the background of the neutrino
telescope IceCube. Thus a surface radio air shower detector could act as a veto
detector for this muonic background. Initial radio background measurements with
a single antenna in 2007 revealed a continuous electromagnetic background
promising a low energy threshold of radio air shower detection. However, short
pulsed radio interferences can mimic real signals and have to be identified in
the frequency range of interest. These properties of the electromagnetic
background was being measured at the South Pole during the Antarctic winter
2009 with two different types of surface antennas. In total four antennas are
placed at distances ranging up to 400m from each other. In 2010 a small eight
channel surface detector will test an amplitude threshold self trigger strategy
with large dipole antennas on the South Pole snow ground. The installation will
be described.

fusing SIFT features of color segmented slice regions of an ear. The proposed
ear identification method makes use of Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to build
ear model with mixture of Gaussian using vector quantization algorithm and K-L
divergence is applied to the GMM framework for recording the color similarity
in the specified ranges by comparing color similarity between a pair of
reference ear and probe ear. SIFT features are then detected and extracted from
each color slice region as a part of invariant feature extraction. The
extracted keypoints are then fused separately by the two fusion approaches,
namely concatenation and the Dempster-Shafer theory. Finally, the fusion
approaches generate two independent augmented feature vectors which are used
for identification of individuals separately. The proposed identification
technique is tested on IIT Kanpur ear database of 400 individuals and is found
to achieve 98.25% accuracy for identification while top 5 matched criteria is
set for each subject.
