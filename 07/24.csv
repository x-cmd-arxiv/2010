it has no widely accepted precise definition. The wavelet transform decomposes
a time series into coefficients that are associated with different scales. The
variance of these coefficients can be used to decompose the variance of the
time series across different scales. A practical definition for characteristic
scale can be formulated in terms of peaks in plots of the wavelet variance
versus scale. This paper presents basic theory for characteristic scales based
upon the discrete wavelet transform, proposes a natural estimator for these
scales and provides a large sample theory for this estimator that permits the
construction of confidence intervals for a true unknown characteristic scale.
Computer experiments are presented that demonstrate the efficacy of the large
sample theory for finite sample sizes. Examples of characteristic scale
estimation are given for global temperature records, coherent structures in
river flows, the Madden-Julian oscillation in an atmospheric time series and
transects of one type of Arctic sea ice.

with mixed choice) is more expressive than {\pi}sep (its subset with only
separate choice). The proof of this result argues with their different
expressive power concerning leader election in symmetric networks. Later on,
Gorla of- fered an arguably simpler proof that, instead of leader election in
symmetric networks, employed the reducibility of ""incestual"" processes (mixed
choices that include both enabled senders and receivers for the same channel)
when running two copies in parallel. In both proofs, the role of breaking (ini-

this role by re-proving the above result-based on a proper formalization of
what it means to break symmetries-without referring to another layer of the
distinguishing problem domain of leader election.
  Both Palamidessi and Gorla rephrased their results by stating that there is
no uniform and reason- able encoding from {\pi}mix into {\pi}sep . We indicate
how the respective proofs can be adapted and exhibit the consequences of
varying notions of uniformity and reasonableness. In each case, the ability to

for which improved cross section data would allow different light-element

precise probes of BBN and evaluations of the cosmological constraints on

literature and this is the first time that a dynamical analysis is obtained for
a relatively large sample of galaxies at z~3. 11 galaxies show ordered
rotational motions (~30% of the sample), in these cases we estimate dynamical
masses by modeling the gas kinematics with rotating disks and exponential mass
distributions. We find dynamical masses in the range 2 \times 10^9 M\odot - 2
\times 10^11 M\odot with a mean value of ~ 2 \times 10^10 M\odot. By comparing
observed gas velocity dispersion with that expected from models, we find that
most rotating objects are dynamically ""hot"", with intrinsic velocity
dispersions of the order of ~90 km s-1. The median value of the ratio between
the maximum disk rotational velocity and the intrinsic velocity dispersion for
the rotating objects is 1.6, much lower than observed in local galaxies value
(~10) and slightly lower than the z~2 value (2 - 4). Finally we use the maximum
rotational velocity from our modeling to build a baryonic Tully-Fisher relation
at z~3. Our measurements indicate that z~3 galaxies have lower stellar masses
(by a factor of ten on average) compared to local galaxies with the same
dynamical mass. However, the large observed scatter suggests that the
Tully-Fisher relation is not yet ""in place"" at these early cosmic ages,
possibly due to the young age of galaxies. A smaller dispersion of the
Tuly-Fisher relation is obtained by taking into account the velocity dispersion
with the use of the S_0.5 indicator, suggesting that turbulent motions might

inclination (i) as it evolves in Kerr spacetime. We focus our attention on the
behaviour of the Carter constant (Q) for near-polar orbits; and develop an
analysis that is independent of and complements radiation reaction models. For
a Schwarzschild black hole, the polar orbits represent the abutment between the
prograde and retrograde orbits at which Q is at its maximum value for given
values of latus rectum (l) and eccentricity (e). The introduction of spin (S =
|J|/M2) to the massive black hole causes this boundary, or abutment, to be
moved towards greater orbital inclination; thus it no longer cleanly separates
prograde and retrograde orbits. To characterise the abutment of a Kerr black
hole (KBH), we first investigated the last stable orbit (LSO) of a
test-particle about a KBH, and then extended this work to general orbits. To
develop a better understanding of the evolution of Q we developed analytical
formulae for Q in terms of l, e, and S to describe elliptical orbits at the
abutment, polar orbits, and last stable orbits (LSO). By knowing the analytical
form of dQ/dl at the abutment, we were able to test a 2PN flux equation for Q.
We also used these formulae to numerically calculate the di/dl of hypothetical
circular orbits that evolve along the abutment. From these values we have
determined that di/dl = -(122.7S - 36S^3)l^-11/2 -(63/2 S + 35/4 S^3) l^-9/2
-15/2 S l^-7/2 -9/2 S l^-5/2. Thus the abutment becomes an important analytical
and numerical laboratory for studying the evolution of Q and i in Kerr
spacetime and for testing current and future radiation back-reaction models for
near-polar retrograde orbits.

The 0-0 S(0) 28.2 micron and 0-0 S(1) 17.0 micron pure rotational lines were
detected out to 10 kpc from the center of each galaxy on both sides of the
major axis, and in NGC 4565 the S(0) line was detected at r = 15 kpc on one
side. This location lies beyond a steep drop in the radio continuum emission
from cosmic rays in the disk. Despite indications that star formation activity
decreases with radius, the H2 excitation temperature and the ratio of the H2
line and the far-IR luminosity surface densities, Sigma_L(H2}/Sigma_L(TIR},
change very little as a function of radius, even into the diffuse outer region
of the disk of NGC 4565. This suggests that the source of excitation of the H2
operates over a large range of radii, and is broadly independent of the
strength and relative location of UV emission from young stars. Although
excitation in photodissociation regions is the most common explanation for the
widespread H2 emission, cosmic ray heating or shocks cannot be ruled out. The
inferred mass surface densities of warm molecular hydrogen in both edge-on
galaxies differ substantially, being 4(-60) M_solar/pc^2 and 3(-50)
M_solar/pc^2 at r = 10 kpc for NGC 4565 and NGC 5907, respectively. The higher
values represent very unlikely point-source upper limits. The point source case
is not supported by the observed emission distribution in the spectral slits.
These mass surface densities cannot support the observed rotation velocities in
excess of 200 km/s. Therefore, warm molecular hydrogen cannot account for dark
matter in these disk galaxies, contrary to what was implied by a previous ISO
study of the nearby edge-on galaxy NGC 891.

structure is thus not ""universal"" but remembers the initial conditions. On
larger scales the density and anisotropy profiles show two characteristic
scales, corresponding to particles at first pericentre and at first apocentre

this excess kinetic energy arises from the environment, we include the surface
pressure term in the virial equation explicitly and relax the assumption that
the density at the halo boundary is zero. Upon inclusion of the surface term,
we find that the haloes are much closer to virialization, however, they still
have some excess kinetic energy. We report trends of the virial ratio including
the extra surface term with three key halo properties: spin, environment, and
concentration. We find that haloes with closer neighbors depart more from
virialization, and that haloes with larger spin parameters do as well. We
conclude that except at the lowest masses ($M < 10^6 \Msun$), dark matter
haloes at high redshift are not fully virialized. This finding has interesting
implications for galaxy formation at these high redshifts, as the excess
kinetic energy will impact the subsequent collapse of baryons and the formation

jointly predict an age of 140+/-30 Myr. This is consistent with the age of the

1901AB (M6.5+M6.5) is a pair of very low-mass stars (Mtot = 0.194 Msun) with
model-derived ages consistent with limits from its lack of activity (> 6 Gyr).
Our improved orbit for Gl 569Bab (M8.5+M9) results in a higher mass for this

masses along with our published results for 2MASS J2206-2047AB (M8+M8) to test
four sets of ultracool model atmospheres currently in use. Fitting these models
to our NIR integrated-light spectra provides temperature estimates warmer by
~250 K than those derived independently from Dusty evolutionary models given
the measured masses and luminosities. We propose that model atmospheres are
more likely to be the source of this discrepancy, as it would be difficult to
explain a uniform temperature offset over such a wide range of masses, ages,
and activity levels in the context of evolutionary models. Our results contrast
those of Konopacky et al. as we find an opposite and smaller mass discrepancy
from what they report when we adopt their model-testing approach since our Teff
estimates from fitting spectra are ~650 K higher than from their fitting of
broadband photometry alone.

of Segue 1 require very high mass-to-light ratios unless the system is far from

that kinematic samples are contaminated by the Sagittarius stream. The
extremely low metallicities ([Fe/H] < -3) of two Segue 1 stars and the large

dwarf galaxy, and we find no evidence in favor of tidal effects. We also show
that contamination by the Sagittarius stream has been overestimated. Segue 1

For a misaligned merger, the disk is tilted with respect to the final black
hole's spin axis. This will cause the disk to precess, but on a timescale
longer than the accretion time. In all cases, we find promising setups for
gamma-ray burst production: the disks are hot, thick, and hyperaccreting, and a
baryon-clear region exists above the black hole.

topological superconducting (TS) medium remains an outstanding open problem.
This is because the quantum gate set that can be generated by braiding of the
Majorana fermions does not include \emph{any} two-qubit gate and also the
single-qubit $\pi/8$ phase gate. In principle, it is possible to create these
crucial extra gates using quantum interference of Majorana fermion currents.
However, it is not clear if the motion of the various order parameter defects
(vortices, domain walls, \emph{etc.}), to which the Majorana fermions are bound
in a TS medium, can be quantum coherent. We show that these obstacles can be
overcome using a semiconductor quantum wire network in the vicinity of an
$s$-wave superconductor, by constructing topologically protected two-qubit
gates and any arbitrary single-qubit phase gate in a topologically unprotected
manner, which can be error corrected using magic state distillation. Thus our
strategy, using a judicious combination of topologically protected and
unprotected gate operations, realizes UQC on a quantum wire network with a
remarkably high error threshold of $0.14$ as compared to $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-4}$
in ordinary unprotected quantum computation.

sloshing and the subsequent formation of cold fronts in the Virgo cluster. We
show for the first time that sloshing reproduces all characteristics of the
observed cold fronts quantitatively, and we suggest a third cold front at 20
kpc NW of the Virgo core. We identify several new features typical for sloshing
cold fronts, most importantly a large-scale brightness asymmetry. We can trace
these new features not only in Virgo, but also in other sloshing cold front
clusters. By comparing synthetic and real observations, we estimate that the
original minor merger event took place about 1.5 Gyr ago when a subcluster of
2-4 \times 10^13 M\odot passed the Virgo core at 100 to 400 kpc distance, where
a smaller mass corresponds to a smaller pericentre distance, and vice versa.
From the merger geometry, we derive the current location of the disturbing
subcluster to be about 1-2 Mpc E of the Virgo core. A possible candidate is
M60. Additionally, we quantify the metal redistribution by sloshing and discuss
its importance. We verify that the subcluster required to produce the observed
cold fronts could be completely ram pressure stripped before reaching the Virgo
centre, and discuss the conditions required for this to be achieved. Finally,
we demonstrate that the bow shock of a fast galaxy passing the Virgo cluster at
~ 400 kpc distance also causes sloshing and leads to very similar cold front
structures. The responsible galaxy would be located about 2 Mpc north of the
Virgo centre. A possible candidate is M85.

Advancement of the occulting edge across the binary orbit has continued and the
photospheres of both stars are now completely obscured at all times. The system
is now visible only by scattered light, and yet it continues to show a periodic
variation on the orbital cycle with an amplitude exceeding two magnitudes. This
variation, which depends only on the binary phase, has likely been present in
the data since at least 1995. It can, by itself, account for shoulders on the
light curve prior to ingress and following egress, obviating the need for
components of extant models such as a scattering halo around star A or forward
scattering from a fuzzy disk edge. A plausible source for the variable
scattering component is reflected light from the far side of a warped occulting
disk. We have detected color changes in V-I of several tenths of a magnitude to
both the blue and red that occur during times of minima. These may indicate the
presence of a third source of light (faint star) within the system, or a change
in the reflectance properties of the disk as the portion being illuminated
varies with the orbital motion of the stars. The data support a picture of the
circumbinary disk as a geometrically thin, optically thick layer of perhaps mm
or cm-sized particles that has been sculpted by the binary stars and possibly
other components into a decidedly nonplanar configuration. A simple (infinitely
sharp) knife-edge model does a good job of accounting for all of the recent

Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. This is accomplished through a set of
``helical"" exchange pathways along the c direction imposed by the chiral
crystal structure and naturally explains the magnetic diffuse scattering which
displays a strong vector chirality up to high temperatures well above the

emission originating prior to the formation of an HII region around the central
star, or from the central object being too cool to produce a HII region. One
way to distinguish between the two scenarios is to determine and model the
spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the masers. We observed a sample of 20
6.7 GHz methanol masers selected from the blind Arecibo survey, from centimeter
to submillimeter wavelengths. We combined our observations with existing data
from various Galactic plane surveys to determine SEDs from centimeter to
near-infrared wavelengths. We find that 70% of the masers do not have any
associated radio continuum, with the rest of the sources being associated with
hypercompact and ultracompact HII regions. Modeling the SEDs shows them to be
consistent with rapidly accreting massive stars, with accretion rates well
above 10^{-3} M_sun/yr. The upper limits on the radio continuum are also
consistent with any ionized region being confined close to the stellar surface.
This confirms the paradigm of 6.7 GHz methanol masers being signposts of early
phases of massive star formation, mostly prior to the formation of a
hypercompact HII region.

  We identify three main gas components (hot core, cold foreground, and

  The hot core, identified by the emission in highly excited lines, shows a
high excitation temperature of 200 K, whereas water in the foreground component
is predominantly in the ortho- and para- ground states. The abundance of water
varies between 4 10^-5 (outflow) and 10^-8 (cold foreground gas). This
variation is most likely due to the freeze-out of water molecules onto dust
grains. The H2O-18/H2O-17 abundance ratio is 3.2, which is consistent with the
O-18/O-17 ratio determined from CO isotopologues. The ortho/para ratio in water
appears to be relatively low 1.6(1) in the cold, quiescent gas, but close to
the equilibrium value of three in the warmer outflow material (2.5(0.8)).

Milky Way contains numerous subhalos. When a dark matter subhalo passes in
front of a star, the light from that star will be deflected by gravitational
lensing, leading to a small change in the star's apparent position. This
astrometric microlensing signal depends on the inner density profile of the
subhalo and can be greater than a few microarcseconds for an intermediate-mass
subhalo (Mvir > 10000 solar masses) passing within arcseconds of a star.
Current and near-future instruments could detect this signal, and we evaluate
SIM's, Gaia's, and ground-based telescopes' potential as subhalo detectors. We
develop a general formalism to calculate a subhalo's astrometric lensing cross
section over a wide range of masses and density profiles, and we calculate the
lensing event rate by extrapolating the subhalo mass function predicted by
simulations down to the subhalo masses potentially detectable with this
technique. We find that, although the detectable event rates are predicted to
be low on the basis of current simulations, lensing events may be observed if
the central regions of dark matter subhalos are more dense than current models
predict (>1 solar mass within 0.1 pc of the subhalo center). Furthermore,
targeted astrometric observations can be used to confirm the presence of a
nearby subhalo detected by gamma-ray emission. We show that, for sufficiently
steep density profiles, ground-based adaptive optics astrometric techniques
could be capable of detecting intermediate-mass subhalos at distances of
hundreds of parsecs, while SIM could detect smaller and more distant subhalos.

the Drude conductivity are identified to infrared active vibrational modes of

depend hardly on temperature, the lowest-lying spectrum with a peak at 0.72 THz
due to the Ba(2) ion's off-centering vibration in the oversized cage changes
with temperature characteristically. With lowering temperature, the spectral
shape of this so-called rattling phonon continues to become so broad that the
line-width amounts to be comparable to the peak frequency. Furthermore, below
about 100 K, the single broad peak tends to split into two subpeaks. While this
splitting can be explained by assuming a multi-well anharmonic potential, the
strong enhancement of the line-width broadening toward low temperature, cannot
be understood, since the Boltzmann factor generally sharpens the

  Graphs, One-Sided vs Two-Sided Error Probability Updated version",,,,"cs.DS cs.DM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present sublinear-time (randomized) algorithms for finding simple cycles
of length at least $k\geq 3$ and tree-minors in bounded-degree graphs. The
complexity of these algorithms is related to the distance of the graph from
being $C_k$-minor-free (resp., free from having the corresponding tree-minor).
In particular, if the graph is far (i.e., $\Omega(1)$-far) {from} being
cycle-free, i.e. if one has to delete a constant fraction of edges to make it
cycle-free, then the algorithm finds a cycle of polylogarithmic length in time
$\tildeO(\sqrt{N})$, where $N$ denotes the number of vertices. This time
complexity is optimal up to polylogarithmic factors.
  The foregoing results are the outcome of our study of the complexity of {\em
one-sided error} property testing algorithms in the bounded-degree graphs
model. For example, we show that cycle-freeness of $N$-vertex graphs can be
tested with one-sided error within time complexity
$\tildeO(\poly(1/\e)\cdot\sqrt{N})$. This matches the known $\Omega(\sqrt{N})$
query lower bound, and contrasts with the fact that any minor-free property
admits a {\em two-sided error} tester of query complexity that only depends on
the proximity parameter $\e$. For any constant $k\geq3$, we extend this result
to testing whether the input graph has a simple cycle of length at least $k$.
On the other hand, for any fixed tree $T$, we show that $T$-minor-freeness has
a one-sided error tester of query complexity that only depends on the proximity
parameter $\e$.
  Our algorithm for finding cycles in bounded-degree graphs extends to general
graphs, where distances are measured with respect to the actual number of
edges. Such an extension is not possible with respect to finding tree-minors in
$o(\sqrt{N})$ complexity.

known to be classified by K-theory. In this paper, by inspecting low-energy
effective field theories realized by two parallel D-branes, we establish a
one-to-one correspondence between the K-theory classification of topological

realization of topological insulators and superconductors comes naturally with
gauge interactions, and the Wess-Zumino term of the D-branes gives rise to a
gauge field theory of topological nature, such as ones with the Chern-Simons

topological insulators and superconductors beyond non-interacting systems, and
the underlying topological field theory description thereof. In particular, our

superhorizon scales, the evolution of metric perturbations is no longer
necessarily scale free due to multiple resonances in the bulk. Based on these

produce line polarization in the range observed in SNe Ia (~1-2%), as well as
the Q-U loops that are frequently seen in all SNe. We have also developed a

achieved a considerable success on the Internet. Bids are made in cents (of
euro) and every bidder can bid as many numbers as she wants. The lowest unique
bid wins the auction. Every bid has a fixed cost, and once a participant makes
a bid, she gets to know whether her bid was unique and whether it was the
lowest unique. Information is updated in real time, but every bidder sees only
what's relevant to the bids she made. We show that the observed behavior in
these auctions differs considerably from what theory would prescribe if all
bidders were fully rational. We show that the seller makes money, which would
not be the case with rational bidders, and some bidders win the auctions quite
often. We describe a possible strategy for these bidders.

naturally defined by an inductive type, they offer data structures in
functional programming and mechanised reasoning with useful principles such as
structural induction and structural recursion. However, for graphs or
""tree-like"" structures - trees involving cycles and sharing - it remains
unclear what kind of inductive structures exists and how we can faithfully
assign a term representation of them. In this paper we propose a simple term
syntax for cyclic sharing structures that admits structural induction and
recursion principles. We show that the obtained syntax is directly usable in
the functional language Haskell and the proof assistant Agda, as well as
ordinary data structures such as lists and trees. To achieve this goal, we use
a categorical approach to initial algebra semantics in a presheaf category.
That approach follows the line of Fiore, Plotkin and Turi's models of abstract
syntax with variable binding.

from the bulge, thin disc, thick disc, and halo, and a population synthesis
approach, we determined the birth rates, numbers, and period distributions of
double white dwarfs (DWDs) within each component. In the Galaxy as a whole, our
model predicts the current birth rate of DWDs to be 3.21x10^{-2} yr^{-1}, the
local density to be 2.2x10^{-4} pc^{-3} and the total number to be 2.76x10^{8}.
Assuming SNIa are formed from the merger of two CO white dwarfs, the SNIa rate
should be 0.0013 yr^{-1}. The frequency spectra of DWD strain amplitude and
number distribution are presented as a function of galactic component, DWD
type, formation channel, and metallicity. We confirm that CO+He and He+He white
dwarf (WD) pairs should dominate the GW signal at very high frequencies (log f
Hz^{-1} > -2.3), while CO+CO and ONeMg WD pairs have a dominant contribution at
log f Hz^{-1} < -2.3. Formation channels involving two common-envelope (CE)
phases or a stable Roche lobe overflow phase followed by a CE phase dominate
the production of DWDs detectable by LISA at log f Hz^{-1} > -4.5. DWDs with
the shortest orbital periods will come from the CE+CE channel. The Exposed Core
plus CE channel is a minor channel. A number of resolved DWDs would be
detected, making up 0.012% of the total number of DWDs in the Galaxy. The
majority of these would be CO+He and He+He pairs formed through the CE+CE
channel.

approaches by perfectly matching returns to call sites---a property that
eliminates spurious interprocedural paths. Vardoulakis and Shivers's recent
formulation of CFA2 showed that it is possible (if expensive) to apply
context-free methods to higher-order languages and gain the same boost in
precision achieved over first-order programs.
  To this young body of work on context-free analysis of higher-order programs,
we contribute a pushdown control-flow analysis framework, which we derive as an
abstract interpretation of a CESK machine with an unbounded stack. One
instantiation of this framework marks the first polyvariant pushdown analysis
of higher-order programs; another marks the first polynomial-time analysis. In
the end, we arrive at a framework for control-flow analysis that can
efficiently compute pushdown generalizations of classical control-flow
analyses.

We
introduce a new set of conformal coordinates to write the $SL(2,R)$ generators.
We find that the Laplacian of the scalar field in many extremal black holes
could be written in terms of the $SL(2,R)$ quadratic Casimir. This suggests
that there exist dual CFT descriptions of these black holes. From the conformal
coordinates, the temperatures of the dual CFTs could be read directly. For the
extremal black hole, the Hawking temperature is vanishing. Correspondingly,
only the left (right) temperature of the dual CFT is non-vanishing and the
excitations of the other sector are suppressed. In the probe limit, we compute
the scattering amplitudes of the scalar off the extremal black holes and find
perfect agreement with the CFT prediction.
