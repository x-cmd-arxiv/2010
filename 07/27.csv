ten rich clusters of galaxies in three different superclusters of the Sloan
Great Wall. We determine the substructure in clusters using the 'Mclust'
package from the 'R' statistical environment and analyse their galaxy content.
We analyse the distribution of the peculiar velocities of galaxies in clusters
and calculate the peculiar velocity of the first ranked galaxy. We show that
clusters in our sample have more than one component; in some clusters different
components also have different galaxy content. We find that in some clusters
with substructure the peculiar velocities of the first ranked galaxies are
large. All clusters in our sample host luminous red galaxies. They can be found
both in the central areas of clusters as well as in the outskirts, some of them
have large peculiar velocities. About 1/3 of red galaxies in clusters are
spirals. The scatter of colours of red ellipticals is in most clusters larger
than that of red spirals. The presence of substructure in rich clusters, signs
of possible mergers and infall, as well as the large peculiar velocities of the
first ranked galaxies suggest that the clusters in our sample are not yet
virialized. We present merger trees of dark matter haloes in an N-body
simulation to demonstrate the formation of present-day dark matter haloes via
multiple mergers during their evolution. In simulated dark matter haloes we
find a substructure similar to that in observed clusters.

to find an empirical relationship (justifying using first principles) between
the planetary magnetic moment, the mass of the planet, its rotation period and
the electrical conductivity of its most conductive layer. Then this is applied
to Hot Jupiters. Using all the magnetic planetary bodies of the solar system
and tracing a graph of the dipolar magnetic moment versus body mass parameter,
the rotation period and electrical conductivity of the internal conductive
layer is obtained. An empirical, functional relation was constructed, which was
adjusted to a power law curve in order to fit the data. Once this empirical
relation has been defined, it is theoretically justified and applied to the
calculation of the dipolar magnetic moment of the extra solar planets known as
Hot Jupiters. Almost all data calculated is interpolated, bestowing confidence
in terms of their validity. The value for the dipolar magnetic moment, obtained
for the exoplanet Osiris (HD209458b), helps understand the way in which the
atmosphere of a planet with an intense magnetic field can be eroded by stellar
wind. The relationship observed also helps understand why Venus and Mars do not

parameters the magnitude and rapidity dependence of nuclear suppression of
J/Psi observed at RHIC in dAu collisions, while the contribution of leading
twist gluon shadowing is found to be vanishingly small. A novel mechanism of
double color filtering for c-cbar dipoles makes nuclei significantly more
transparent in AA compared to pA collisions. This is one of the mechanisms
which make impossible a model independent ""data driven"" extrapolation from pA
to AA. This effect also explains the enhancement of nuclear suppression
observed at forward rapidities in AA collisions at RHIC, what hardly can be
related to the produced dense medium. J/Psi is found to be a clean and
sensitive tool measuring the transport coefficient characterizing the dense
matter created in AA collisions. RHIC data for pT dependence of J/Psi
production in nuclear collisions are well explained with the low value of the
transport coefficient q_0-hat<0.5 GeV^2/fm.

a steady state model fit to disc evolution statistics for main sequence A
stars, this time using realistic grain optical properties, then evolve that

that debris discs around giant stars are harder to detect than on the main
sequence because radiation pressure is more effective at removing small dust
around higher luminosity stars. Just 12% of first ascent giants within 100pc
are predicted to have discs detectable with Herschel at 160um. However this is
subject to the uncertain effect of sublimation on the disc, which we propose
can thus be constrained with such observations. Our model also finds that the
rapid decline in stellar luminosity results in only very young white dwarfs
having luminous discs. As such systems are on average at larger distances they
are hard to detect, but we predict that the stellar parameters most likely to
yield a disc detection are a white dwarf at 200pc with cooling age of 0.1Myr,
in line with observations of the Helix Nebula. Our model does not predict
close-in (<0.01AU) dust, as observed for some white dwarfs, however we find

replenish these discs.

by exploring a different orbital configuration---Jupiter lies outside Saturn
(q<1, where q= M_i/M_o is the mass ratio of the inner planet and the outer
one). We focus on the effects of different initial separations (d) between the
two planets and the various surface density profiles of the disk, where \sigma
\propto r^{-\alpha}. We also compare the results of different orbital
configurations of the planet pair. Our results show that: (1) when the initial
separation is relatively large(d>d_{iLr}, where d_{iLr} is the distance between
Jupiter and its first inner Lindblad resonance), the two planets undergo
divergent migration. However, the inward migration of Saturn could be halted
when Jupiter compresses the inner disk in which Saturn is embedded. (2)
Convergent migration occurs when the initial separation is smaller (d<d_{iLr})
and the density slope of the disk is nearly flat (\alpha<1/2). Saturn is then
forced by Jupiter to migrate inward when the two planets are trapped into mean
motion resonances (MMRs), and Saturn may get very close to the central star.
(3) In the case of q<1, the eccentricity of Saturn could be excited to a very
high value (e_{S}~0.4-0.5) by the MMRs and the system could maintain stability.
These results explain the formation of MMRs in the exoplanet systems where the
outer planet is more massive than the inner one. It also helps us to understand
the origin of the ""hot Jupiter/Saturn"" undergoing high eccentric orbit.

study proposes rules for gene regulation based on the assumption that free
regulatory sites are exposed to nonspecific binding errors, whereas sites bound
to their cognate regulators are protected from errors. Hence, the selected
mechanisms keep the sites bound to their designated regulators for most of the
time, thus minimizing fitness-reducing errors. This offers an explanation of
the empirically demonstrated Savageau demand rule: Genes that are needed often
in the natural environment tend to be regulated by activators, and rarely
needed genes tend to be regulated by repressors; in both cases, sites are bound
for most of the time, and errors are minimized. The fitness advantage of error
minimization appears to be readily selectable. The present approach can also
generate rules for multi-regulator systems. The error-minimization framework
raises several experimentally testable hypotheses. It may also apply to other
biological regulation systems, such as those involving protein-protein

societies. Thus far, modeling of pandemics has focused on either large-scale
difference equation models like the SIR and the SEIR models, or detailed
micro-level simulations, which are harder to apply at a global scale. This
paper introduces a hybrid model for pandemics considering both global and local
spread of infections. We hypothesize that the spread of an infectious disease
between regions is significantly influenced by global traffic patterns and the
spread within a region is influenced by local conditions. Thus we model the
spread of pandemics considering the connections between regions for the global
spread of infection and population density based on the SEIR model for the
local spread of infection. We validate our hybrid model by carrying out a
simulation study for the spread of SARS pandemic of 2002-2003 using available
data on population, population density, and traffic networks between different
regions. While it is well-known that international relationships and global
traffic patterns significantly influence the spread of pandemics, our results
show that integrating these factors into relatively simple models can greatly
improve the results of modeling disease spread.

derived by radionuclide decay in comets and asteroids in 1.05x109 years. For
each amino acid the radiolysis degree and the radioracemization degree was
measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and by optical rotatory

constant kdsc and a radioracemization rate constant krac have been determined

the expected total dose delivered by the natural radionuclides decay to all the

ordering promotes increased growth of aggregates. Systems that display coupled
aggregation and liquid-crystal ordering include wormlike micelles, chromonic

molecular models that capture key features of coupled aggregation and
liquid-crystal ordering common to many different systems are lacking; in
particular, the role of monomer aspect ratio and aggregate flexibility in
controlling the phase behavior are not well understood. Here we study a minimal
system of sticky cylinders using Monte Carlo simulations and analytic theory.
Cylindrical monomers interact primarily by hard-core interactions but can stack
and bind end to end. We present results for several different cylinder aspect
ratios and a range of end-to-end binding energies. The phase diagrams are
qualitatively similar to those of chromonic liquid crystals, with an
isotropic-nematic-columnar triple point. The location of the triple point is
sensitive to the monomer aspect ratio.We find that the aggregate persistence
length varies with temperature in a way that is controlled by the interaction
potential; this suggests that the form of the interaction potential affects the
phase behavior of the system. Our analytic theory shows improvement compared to
previous theory in quantitatively predicting the I-N transition for relatively
stiff aggregates, but requires a better treatment of aggregate flexibility.

classification of linear sequence data where the task is to segment and
classify the data according to an underlying hidden discrete state sequence.
Such analysis is commonplace in the empirical sciences including genomics,
finance and speech processing. In particular, we are interested in answering
the following question: given data $y$ and a statistical model $\pi(x,y)$ of
the hidden states $x$, what should we report as the prediction $\hat{x}$ under
the posterior distribution $\pi (x|y)$? That is, how should you make a
prediction of the underlying states? We demonstrate that traditional approaches
such as reporting the most probable state sequence or most probable set of
marginal predictions can give undesirable classification artefacts and offer
limited control over the properties of the prediction. We propose a decision
theoretic approach using a novel class of Markov loss functions and report
$\hat{x}$ via the principle of minimum expected loss (maximum expected
utility). We demonstrate that the sequence of minimum expected loss under the
Markov loss function can be enumerated exactly using dynamic programming
methods and that it offers flexibility and performance improvements over
existing techniques. The result is generic and applicable to any probabilistic
model on a sequence, such as Hidden Markov models, change point or product
partition models.

minimum at low shear rates and then increases rapidly at higher shear rates. We
found that at sufficiently high shear rates, the slip flow over atomically flat
crystalline surfaces is anisotropic. It is demonstrated numerically that the
friction coefficient at the liquid-solid interface (the ratio of viscosity and
slip length) undergoes a transition from a constant value to the power-law
decay as a function of the slip velocity. The characteristic velocity of the
transition correlates well with the diffusion velocity of fluid monomers in the
first fluid layer near the solid wall at equilibrium. We also show that in the
linear regime, the friction coefficient is well described by a function of a
single variable, which is a product of the magnitude of surface-induced peak in
the structure factor and the contact density of the adjacent fluid layer. The
universal relationship between the friction coefficient and induced fluid

dividing the outflow in three chemical regimes, two of them associated with the
wing component and the other the EHV gas. The analysis of the two wing regimes
shows that species like H2CO and CH3OH favor the low-velocity gas, while SiO
and HCN are more abundant in the fastest gas. We also find that the EHV regime
is relatively rich in O-bearing species, as is not only detected in CO and SiO
(already reported elsewhere), but also in SO, CH3OH, and H2CO (newly reported

relatively poor in C-bearing molecules like CS and HCN. We suggest that this
difference in composition arises from a lower C/O ratio in the EHV gas. The
different chemical compositions of the wing and EHV regimes suggest that these
two outflow components have different physical origins. The wing component is
better explained by shocked ambient gas, although none of the existing shock
models explains all observed features. The peculiar composition of the EHV gas
may reflect its origin as a dense wind from the protostar or its surrounding
disk.

deep far UV (FUV) data from GALEX in the outer disk of M83. The FUV and HI maps
show a stunning spatial correlation out to almost 4 optical radii (r25),
roughly the extent of our maps. This underscores that HI traces the gas
reservoir for outer disk star formation and it implies that massive (at least
low level) star formation proceeds almost everywhere HI is observed. Whereas
the average FUV intensity decreases steadily with increasing radius before
leveling off at ~1.7 r25, the decline in HI surface density is more subtle. Low
HI columns (<2 M_solar/pc^2) contribute most of the mass in the outer disk,
which is not the case within r25. The time for star formation to consume the
available HI, inferred from the ratio of HI to FUV intensity, rises with
increasing radius before leveling off at ~100 Gyr, i.e., many Hubble times,
near ~1.7 r25. Assuming the relatively short H2 depletion times observed in the
inner parts of galaxies hold in outer disks, the conversion of HI into bound,
molecular clouds seems to limit star formation in outer galaxy disks. The long
consumption times suggest that most of the extended HI observed in M83 will not
be consumed by in situ star formation. However, even these low star formation
rates are enough to expect moderate chemical enrichment in a closed outer disk.

the size of a red supergiant star. An excess in UV emission two weeks after
shock breakout compared to SNe well fitted by model atmosphere-code synthetic

out dynamical simulations to properly account for gravitational interactions

resonance that prevents close encounters and provides long-term stability. The

(SFRs) and stellar masses, implying that their star-formation histories (SFHs)
are highly similar. Moreover, observations show that the UV luminosities and
stellar masses grow from z=8 to 3, implying that the SFRs increase with time.
We compare the cosmologically averaged evolution in galaxies at 3 < z < 8 at
constant comoving number density, n = 2 x 10^-4 Mpc^-3. This allows us to study
the evolution of stellar mass and star formation in the galaxy predecessors and
descendants in ways not possible using galaxies selected at constant stellar
mass or SFR, quantities that evolve strongly in time. We show that the average
SFH of these galaxies increase smoothly from z=8 to 3 as SFR ~ t^alpha with
alpha = 1.7 +/- 0.2. This conflicts with assumptions that the SFR is either
constant or declines exponentially in time. We show that the stellar mass
growth in these galaxies is consistent with this derived SFH. This provides
evidence that the slope of the high-mass end of the IMF is approximately
Salpeter unless the duty cycle of star formation is much less than unity. We
argue that these relations follow from gas accretion (either through accretion
or delivered by mergers) coupled with galaxy disk growth under the assumption
that the SFR depends on the local gas surface density. This predicts that gas
fractions decrease from z=8 to 3 on average as f_gas ~ (1+z)^0.9 for galaxies
with this number density. The implied galaxy gas accretion rates at z > 4 are
as fast and may even exceed the SFR: this is the ""gas accretion epoch"". At z <
4 the SFR overtakes the implied gas accretion rate, indicating a period where
galaxies consume gas faster than it is acquired. At z < 3, galaxies with this
number density depart from these relations implying that star formation and gas
accretion are slowed at later times.

sensitive tool to study dark matter (DM) annihilation or decay in the main

window excluding the Galactic plane, we show for one year of Fermi data that
adding a spherical template (such as a line-of-sight DM annihilation profile)
to an astrophysical background significantly reduces chi^2 of the fit to the
data. In some energy bins the significance of this DM-like fraction is above
three sigma. This can be viewed as a hint of DM annihilation signal, although
astrophysical sources cannot be ruled out at this moment. We use the derived DM
fraction as a conservative upper limit on DM annihilation signal. In the case
of bb-bar annihilation channel the limits are about a factor of two less
constraining than the limits from dwarf galaxies. The uncertainty of our method
is dominated by systematics related to modeling the astrophysical background.
We show that with one year of Fermi data the statistical sensitivity would be
sufficient to detect DM annihilation with thermal freeze out cross section for
masses below 100 GeV.

derived from C18O J=3-2 data. Two populations are examined, identified using
the automated algorithms CLFIND and GAUSSCLUMPS on existing SCUBA data. The
clumps have supersonic linewidths with distributions which suggest the C18O
line probes a lower-density 'envelope' rather than a dense inner core. Similar
linewidth distributions for protostellar and starless clumps implies protostars
do not have a significant impact on their immediate environment. The proximity
to an active young stellar cluster seems to affect the linewidths: those in
NGC1333 are greater than elsewhere. In IC348 the proximity to the old IR
cluster has little influence, with the linewidths being the smallest of all. A
virial analysis suggests that the clumps are bound and close to equipartition.
In particular, the starless clumps occupy the same parameter space as the
protostars, suggesting they are true stellar precursors and will go on to form
stars. We also search for ordered C18O velocity gradients across the face of
each core, usually interpreted as rotation. We note a correlation between the
directions of the identified gradients and outflows across protostars,
indicating we may not have a purely rotational signature. The fitted gradients
are larger than found in previous work, probably as a result of the higher
resolution of our data and/or outflow contamination. These gradients, if
interpreted solely in terms of rotation, suggest that rotation is not
dynamically significant. Furthermore, derived specific angular momenta are
smaller than observed in previous studies, centred around j~0.001 km/s pc,
which indicates we have identified lower levels of rotation, or that the C18O
J=3-2 line probes conditions significantly denser and/or colder than n~10^5 per
cc and T~10 K.

underlying the functional integral representation of the spin-boson and related
models with spin anisotropy are discussed. To this end, an introduction to spin
coherent states and spin path integrals is presented with a focus on the
spin-boson model. It is shown that, even for the Ising-anisotropic case as in
the spin-boson model, the path integral in the continuum limit in the coherent
state representation involves a Berry phase term. As a result, the effective
action for the spin degrees of freedom does not assume the form of a
Ginzburg-Landau-Wilson functional. The implications of the Berry-phase term for
the quantum-critical behavior of the spin-boson model are discussed. The case
of arbitrary spin is also considered.

condition that forces the solutions of the H-J equation to be everywhere $C^2$.
That is, quantum mechanics is just classical mechanics constrained to ensure
that ``God does not play dice with the universe.'' I show that this condition,
which imposes global determinism, strongly suggests that $\psi^*\psi$ measures
the density of universes in a multiverse. I show that this interpretation
implies the Born Interpretation, and that the function space for $\psi$ is
larger than a Hilbert space, with plane waves automatically included. Finally,
I use H-J theory to derive the momentum-position uncertainty relation, thus
proving that in quantum mechanics, uncertainty arises from the interference of
the other universes of the multiverse, not from some intrinsic indeterminism in

and Feynman-Weinberg quantum gravity holds at all times, then in the very early
universe, the Cosmic Background Radiation (CBR) cannot couple to right handed
electrons and quarks. If this property of CBR has persisted to the present day,
the Ultra HIgh Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR) can propagate a factor of ten further
than they could if the CBR were an electromagnetic field, since most of the
cross section for pion production when a UHECR hits a CBR photon is due to a
quark spin flip, and such a flip cannot occur if the CBR photon cannot couple
to right handed quarks. The GZM effect will still reduce the number of UHECR,
but UHECR can arrive from a distance of a redshift of up to $z=0.1$. I show
that taking this additional propagation distance into account allows us to
identify the sources of 4 of the 6 UHECR which the Pierre Auger Collaboration
could not identify, and also identify the source of the 320 EeV UHECR seen by
the Fly's Eye instrument. I suggest an experiment to test this hypothesis about
the CBR.

singularity of the drift term for $X_t = 0$, different natures of boundary at
the origin arise depending on the real parameter $n$: entrance, exit, and
regular. For each of them we calculate analytically and numerically the
probability density functions of first-passage times or first-exit times.
Nontrivial behaviour is observed in the case of a regular boundary.

problems on a boundary at infinity, which are not well defined unless a certain

in asymptotically AdS spaces these problems are systematically addressed by the
method of holographic renormalization. We argue that this class of a priori ill
defined variational problems extends far beyond the realm of holographic
dualities. As we show, exactly the same issues arise in gravity in non
asymptotically AdS spaces, in point particles with certain unbounded from below
potentials, and even fundamental strings in flat or AdS backgrounds. We show
that the variational problem in all such cases can be made well defined by the
following procedure, which is intrinsic to the system in question and does not
rely on the existence of a holographically dual theory: (i) The first step is
the construction of the space of the most general asymptotic solutions of the
classical equations of motion that inherits a well defined symplectic form from
that on phase space. The requirement of a well defined symplectic form is
essential and often leads to a necessary repackaging of the degrees of freedom.
(ii) Once the space of asymptotic solutions has been constructed in terms of
the correct degrees of freedom, then there exists a boundary term that is
obtained as a certain solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation which
simultaneously makes the variational problem well defined and preserves the
symplectic form. This procedure is identical to holographic renormalization in
the case of asymptotically AdS gravity, but it is applicable to any Hamiltonian
system.

Using this advantage to identify likely low-mass planet hosts, however, has
been difficult: until now, methods to determine M-dwarf metallicities required
observationally expensive data (such as parallaxes and high-resolution
spectra), and were limited to a few bright cool stars. We have obtained
moderate (R~2700) resolution K-band spectra of 17 M-dwarfs with metallicity
estimates derived from their FGK companions. Analysis of these spectra, and
inspection of theoretical synthetic spectra, reveal that an M-dwarf's
metallicity can be inferred from the strength of its Na I doublet (2.206 {\mu}m
& 2.209 {\mu}m) and Ca I triplet (2.261 {\mu}m, 2.263 {\mu}m & 2.265 {\mu}m)

index, to construct an empirical metallicity indicator applicable for M-dwarfs
with near-solar metallicities (-0.5<[Fe/H]<+0.5). This indicator has an
accuracy of +/- 0.15 dex, comparable to that of existing techniques for
estimating M-dwarf metallicities, but is more observationally accessible,
requiring only a moderate resolution K-band spectrum. Applying this method to 8
known M-dwarf planet hosts, we estimate metallicities ([Fe/H]) in excess of the
mean metallicity of M-dwarfs in the solar neighborhood, consistent with the
metallicity distribution of FGK planet hosts.

related to the flux of gravitational waves far from the source, and the flux of
energy carried to distant observers, $\dot E$. Conservation laws guarantee
that, in asympotically flat spacetimes, $\psi_4 \propto 1/r$ and $\dot E
\propto 1/r^2$ as $r \to \infty$. Most calculations extract these quantities at
some finite extraction radius. An understanding of finite radius corrections to
$\psi_4$ and $\dot E$ allows us to more accurately infer their asymptotic
values from a computation. In this paper, we show that, if the final state of
the system is a black hole, then the leading correction to $\psi_4$ is ${\cal
O}(1/r^3)$, and that to the energy flux is ${\cal O}(1/r^4)$ --- not ${\cal

relies on the behavior of the curvature scalars for black hole spacetimes.

Kitt Peak has stayed remarkably constant over the past 20 years. Compared to
1988, the 2009/10 data show no change in the sky brightness at Zenith though,
as expected, the sky glow has increased most dramatically in the direction of
Tucson. Comparisons between the 1999 and 2009/10 data suggest that the sky has
actually decreased in brightness compared to 10 years ago. However, the older
data were both taken during times of increased solar activity. When we correct
the measurements for the solar irradiance fluctuations, we find that compared
to 20 years ago, the sky is ~0.1 magnitude brighter at Zenith and ~0.3
magnitudes brighter towards Tucson. But even after these corrections, we still
find that the sky over Kitt Peak is comparable to what it was 10 years ago at
Zenith and ~0.1 magnitude darker towards Tucson. This suggests that the
strengthened lighting ordinances Tucson and Pima County established in the
early 2000s have been quite effective. With some care, the Kitt Peak night sky

phases have been central problems in physics. Yet, they are indeed challenging
problems due to the computational difficulties in analyzing quantum many-body
systems and the lack of a general framework for classifications. While
frustration-free Hamiltonians, which appear as fixed point Hamiltonians of
renormalization group transformations, may serve as representatives of quantum
phases, it is still difficult to analyze and classify quantum phases of
arbitrary frustration-free Hamiltonians exhaustively. Here, we address these
problems by sharpening our considerations to a certain subclass of
frustration-free Hamiltonians, called stabilizer Hamiltonians, which have been
actively studied in quantum information science. We propose a model of
frustration-free Hamiltonians which covers a large class of physically
realistic stabilizer Hamiltonians, constrained to only three physical
conditions; the locality of interaction terms, translation symmetries and scale
symmetries, meaning that the number of ground states does not grow with the
system size. We show that quantum phases arising in two-dimensional models can
be classified exactly through certain quantum coding theoretical operators,
called logical operators, by proving that two models with topologically
distinct shapes of logical operators are always separated by quantum phase
transitions.

is the fundamental property shared by quantum measurement theory and
relativity, and it is the key to understanding the connection between nonlocal
measurement effects and elementary interactions. To prevent those effects from
transmitting information between the generating and observing process, they
must be induced by the kinds of entangling interactions that constitute
measurements, as implied in the Projection Postulate. They must also be
nondeterministic as reflected in the Born Probability Rule. The nondeterminism
of entanglement-generating processes explains why the relevant types of
information cannot be instantiated in elementary systems, and why the
sequencing of nonlocal effects is, in principle, unobservable. This perspective
suggests a simple hypothesis about nonlocal transfers of amplitude during
entangling interactions, which yields straightforward experimental
consequences.

nonparametric estimation of the path of the (possibly stochastic) diffusion

techniques combined with wavelet thresholding, we construct adaptive estimators
that achieve a nearly optimal rate within a large scale of smoothness
constraints of Besov type. Since the diffusion coefficient is usually genuinely
random, we propose a new criterion to assess the quality of estimation; we
retrieve the usual minimax theory when this approach is restricted to a
deterministic diffusion coefficient. In particular, we take advantage of recent
results of Reiss [33] of asymptotic equivalence between a Gaussian diffusion
with additive noise and Gaussian white noise model, in order to prove a sharp
lower bound.

first measurement of high-frequency conductivity of graphene from THz to mid-IR

absolute strength is substantially lower than theoretical predictions. This
anomalous reduction of free electron oscillator strength is corroborated by

under an axial DC magnetic field are characterized at several temperatures
below the liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K). Two main shielding properties are
studied and compared with those of Bi-2223, a material that has been considered
in the past for bulk magnetic shields. The first property is related to the
maximum magnetic flux density that can be screened, Blim; it is defined as the
applied magnetic flux density below which the field attenuation measured at the
centre of the shield exceeds 1000. For a cylinder of Bi-2212 with a wall
thickness of 5 mm and a large ratio of length over radius, Blim is evaluated to
1 T at T = 10 K. This value largely exceeds the Blim value measured at the same
temperature on similar tubes of Bi-2223. The second shielding property that is
characterized is the dependence of Blim with respect to variations of the sweep
rate of the applied field, dBapp/dt. This dependence is interpreted in terms of
the power law E = Ec(J/Jc)^n and allows us to determine the exponent n of this
E(J) characteristics for Bi-2212. The characterization of the magnetic field
relaxation involves very small values of the electric field. This gives us the
opportunity to experimentally determine the E(J) law in an unexplored region of
small electric fields. Combining these results with transport and AC shielding
measurements, we construct a piecewise E(J) law that spans over 8 orders of

positive observation of neutrinos in coincidence with a GRB would identify
these objects as sources of the highest-energy cosmic rays and provide
invaluable information about the processes occurring inside these phenomena.
Calculations show that a kilometer-scale neutrino telescope is necessary for
this task. The idea of such a detector is now becoming reality as IceCube at
the South Pole nears completion. The contribution reviews the status of the
construction and operation of IceCube and summarize the results from searches
for neutrinos from GRBs and similar phenomena with IceCube and its predecessor,
AMANDA. At the end, an outline of future plans and perspectives for IceCube is
given.

formalism of pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians. The proof consists in the analysis
of three expressions for Hamiltonians, which are derived from the Dirac
equation and describe the dynamics of spin 1/2 particles in the gravitational
field of the Kerr solution. The Hamiltonians correspond to different choices of
tetrad vectors and differ from each other. The differences between the
Hamiltonians confirm the conclusion known from many studies that the
Hamiltonians derived from the Dirac equation are non-unique. Application of
standard pseudo-Hermitian quantum mechanics rules to each of these Hamiltonians
produces the same Hermitian Hamiltonian. The eigenvalue spectrum of the
resulting Hamiltonian is the same as that of the Hamiltonians derived from the
Dirac equation with any chosen system of tetrad vectors. For description of the
dynamics of spin 1/2 particles in stationary gravitational fields can be used
not only the formalism of pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians, but also an
alternative approach, which employs the Parker scalar product. The authors show
that the alternative approach is equivalent to the formalism of

Martin-L\""of type theory, in the categories Top of topological spaces and SSet

which has suggested that a suitable environment for the interpretation of
identity types should be a category equipped with a weak factorisation system
in the sense of Bousfield--Quillen. It turns out that this is not quite enough
for a sound model, due to some subtle coherence issues concerned with stability
under substitution; and so our first task is to introduce a slightly richer
structure---which we call a homotopy-theoretic model of identity types---and to
prove that this is sufficient for a sound interpretation.
  Now, although both Top and SSet are categories endowed with a weak
factorisation system---and indeed, an entire Quillen model
structure---exhibiting the additional structure required for a
homotopy-theoretic model is quite hard to do. However, the categories we are
interested in share a number of common features, and abstracting away from
these leads us to introduce the notion of a path object category. This is a
relatively simple axiomatic framework, which is nonetheless sufficiently strong
to allow the construction of homotopy-theoretic models. Now by exhibiting
suitable path object structures on Top and SSet, we endow those categories with
the structure of a homotopy-theoretic model: and in this way, obtain the
desired topological and simplicial models of identity types.

three different configurations where the entangled photon source was placed at

independent entries, where the distribution of the $(i,j)$ matrix element is
given by the probability measure $\nu_{ij}$ with zero expectation and with
variance $\sigma_{ij}^2$. We assume that the variances satisfy the
normalization condition $\sum_{i} \sigma^2_{ij} = 1$ for all $j$ and that there
is a positive constant $c$ such that $c\le N \sigma_{ij}^2 \le c^{-1}$. We
further assume that the probability distributions $\nu_{ij}$ have a uniform
subexponential decay. We prove that the Stieltjes transform of the empirical
eigenvalue distribution of $H$ is given by the Wigner semicircle law uniformly
up to the edges of the spectrum with an error of order $ (N \eta)^{-1}$ where
$\eta$ is the imaginary part of the spectral parameter in the Stieltjes
transform. There are three corollaries to this strong local semicircle law: (1)
Rigidity of eigenvalues: If $\gamma_j =\gamma_{j,N}$ denotes the {\it classical
location} of the $j$-th eigenvalue under the semicircle law ordered in
increasing order, then the $j$-th eigenvalue $\lambda_j$ is close to $\gamma_j$

this idea, we perform potential and linear force-free field extrapolations
using the FROMAGE service. The extrapolations show that the emergence site is
cospatial with a 3D null point, from which a spine originates. This magnetic
configuration and the overall orientation of the field lines above the emerging
flux region are compatible with the structures observed in the different
atmospheric layers, and remain stable against variations of the force-free

followed by the occurrence of variable-range hopping conduction at low

a simple point cluster model in which results depend only on cluster-cluster
correlations and on the distribution of the number of objects within a cluster,
or cluster occupancy. The point cluster model leads to expressions for moments
of galaxy counts in which the volume-averaged moments on large scales approach
those of the halo distribution and on smaller scales exhibit hierarchical
clustering with amplitudes $S_k$ determined by moments of the occupancy
distribution. In this limit, the halo model predictions are purely
combinatoric, and have no dependence on halo profile, concentration parameter,
or potential asphericity. The full halo model introduces only two additional
effects: on large scales, haloes of different mass have different clustering
strengths, introducing relative bias parameters; and on the smallest scales,
halo structure is resolved and details of the halo profile become important,
introducing shape-dependent form factors. Because of differences between
discrete and continuous statistics, the hierarchical amplitudes for galaxies

field measurements obtained with Milne-Eddington inversion techniques along
with measured continuum intensities and Stokes V amplitude asymmetry at a
spatial resolution of 0.15 arcseconds to establish statistical relations
between the measured quantities. We also study these properties for different
types of distinct magnetic features, such as micropores, bright points,
ribbons, flowers and strings. We present the first direct observations of a
small-scale granular magneto-convection pattern within extended regions of
strong (more than 600 G average) magnetic field. Along the boundaries of the
flux concentrations we see mostly downflows and asymmetric Stokes V profiles,
consistent with synthetic line profiles calculated from MHD simulations. We
note the frequent occurrence of bright downflows along these boundaries. In the
interior of the flux concentrations, we observe an up/down flow pattern that we
identify as small-scale magnetoconvection, appearing similar to that of
field-free granulation but with scales 4 times smaller. Measured RMS velocities
are 70% of those of nearby field-free granulation, even though the average
radiative flux is not reduced. The interiors of these flux concentrations are
dominated by upflows.

so called prequantum classical statistical field theory (PCSFT). Roughly
speaking PCSFT is a classical signal theory applied to a special class of
signals -- ""quantum systems"". PCSFT reproduces successfully all probabilistic
predictions of QM, including correlations for entangled systems. This model
peacefully coexists with all known no-go theorems, including Bell's theorem. In
our approach QM is an approximate model. All probabilistic predictions of QM
are only (quite good) approximations of ""real physical averages"". The latter
are averages with respect to fluctuations of prequantum fields. In particular,
Born's rule is only an approximate rule. More precise experiments should
demonstrate its violation. We present a simple experiment which has to produce
statistical data violating Born's rule. Since the PCSFT-presentation of this
experiment may be difficult for experimenters, we reformulate consequences of
PCSFT in terms of the conventional wave function. In general, deviation from
Born's rule is rather small. We found an experiment amplifying this deviation.
We start with a toy example in section 2. Then we present a more realistic
example based on Gaussian states with very small dispersion, see section 3.

processes leading to the enhanced deuterium fractionation observed in the ISM

protostellar envelopes. Very high molecular D/H ratios have been found for
saturated molecules and ions. However, little is known about the deuterium

intermediate stage in the formation of more complex, saturated molecules. The
imidogen radical NH is such an intermediate species for the ammonia synthesis
in the gas phase. Herschel/HIFI represents a unique opportunity to study the
deuteration and formation mechanisms of such species, which are not observable
from the ground. We searched here for the deuterated radical ND in order to
determine the deuterium fractionation of imidogen and constrain the deuteration
mechanism of this species. We observed the solar-mass Class 0 protostar
IRAS16293-2422 with the heterodyne instrument HIFI as part of the Herschel key
programme CHESS (Chemical HErschel Surveys of Star forming regions). The
deuterated form of the imidogen radical ND was detected and securely identified
with 2 hyperfine component groups of its fundamental transition in absorption
against the continuum background emitted from the nascent protostar. The 3
groups of hyperfine components of its hydrogenated counterpart NH were also
detected in absorption. We derive a very high deuterium fractionation with an
[ND]/[NH] ratio of between 30 and 100%. The deuterium fractionation of imidogen
is of the same order of magnitude as that in other molecules, which suggests
that an efficient deuterium fractionation mechanism is at play. We discuss two
possible formation pathways for ND, by means of either the reaction of N+ with
HD, or deuteron/proton exchange with NH.

Vlasov-Maxwell system of equations using a Fourier transform method in velocity
space. In this method, the distribution functions for electrons and ions are
Fourier transformed in velocity space, and the resulting set of equations are
solved numerically. In the original Vlasov equation, phase mixing may lead to
an oscillatory behavior and sharp gradients of the distribution function in
velocity space, which is problematic in simulations where it can lead to
unphysical electric fields and instabilities and to the recurrence effect where
parts of the initial condition recur in the simulation. The particle
distribution function is in general smoother in the Fourier transformed
velocity space, which is desirable for the numerical approximations. By
designing outflow boundary conditions in the Fourier transformed velocity
space, the highest oscillating terms are allowed to propagate out through the
boundary and are removed from the calculations, thereby strongly reducing the
numerical recurrence effect. The outflow boundary conditions in higher
dimensions including electromagnetic effects are discussed. The Fourier
transform method is also suitable to solve the Fourier transformed Wigner
equation, which is the quantum mechanical analogue of the Vlasov equation for
classical particles.

galaxy -- we do not observe the previously reported strong drop-off in the
S(1)/S(0) line intensity ratio in the outer regions of the galaxy, so we find
no evidence for the very massive cold CO-free molecular clouds invoked to
explain the past observations. The H$_2$ level excitation temperatures increase
monotonically indicating more than one component to the emitting gas. More than
99\% of the mass is in the lowest excitation (T$_{ex}$ $\sim$125 K) ``warm''

dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy. Including the observed far-infrared

the host semiconductor; this microscopic spectral character is consistent with
the physical premise of the k.p kinetic-exchange model. On the other hand, the
various models with a band structure comprising an impurity band detached from
the valence band assume mutually incompatible microscopic spectral character.
By adapting the tight-binding Anderson calculations individually to each of the
impurity band pictures in the single Mn impurity limit and then by exploring
the entire doping range we find that a detached impurity band does not persist
in any of these models in ferromagnetic (Ga,Mn)As.

$\Delta$-isobars at large center of mass angles within the QCD hard
rescattering model (HRM). According to the HRM, the process develops in three
main steps: the photon knocks the quark from one of the nucleons in the
deuteron; the struck quark rescatters off a quark from the other nucleon
sharing the high energy of the photon; then the energetic quarks recombine into
two outgoing baryons which have large transverse momenta. Within the HRM, the
cross section is expressed through the amplitude of $pn\rightarrow
\Delta\Delta$ scattering which we evaluated based on the quark-interchange
model of hard hadronic scattering. Calculations show that the angular
distribution and the strength of the photodisintegration is mainly determined
by the properties of the
  $pn\rightarrow \Delta\Delta$ scattering. We predict that the cross section of
the deuteron breakup to $ \Delta^{++}\Delta^{-}$ is 4-5 times larger than that
of the breakup to the $ \Delta^{+}\Delta^{0}$ channel. Also, the angular
distributions for these two channels are markedly different. These can be
compared with the predictions based on the assumption that two hard
$\Delta$-isobars are the result of the disintegration of the preexisting
$\Delta\Delta$ components of the deuteron wave function. In this case, one
expects the angular distributions and cross sections of the breakup in both $

this paper we report the first attempt for a detailed modeling of IRAS
00470+6429, for which we have the best set of observations. Our modeling is
based on two key assumptions: the star has a main-sequence luminosity for its
spectral type (B2) and the circumstellar envelope is bimodal, composed of a
slowly outflowing disk-like wind and a fast polar wind. Both outflows are
assumed to be purely radial. We adopt a novel approach to describe the dust
formation site in the wind that employs timescale arguments for grain
condensation and a self-consistent solution for the dust destruction surface.
With the above assumptions we were able to reproduce satisfactorily many
observational properties of IRAS 00470+6429, including the H line profiles and
the overall shape of the spectral energy distribution. Our adopted recipe for
dust formation proved successful in reproducing the correct amount of dust
formed in the circumstellar envelope. Possible shortcomings of our model, as
well as suggestions for future improvements, are discussed.

convergence of the space-time discretization without any condition that couples
the time step to the spatial resolution. Then we estimate the Galerkin

isothermal soon after formation, in which case the temperature history suggests
episodes of additional heating or more rapid cooling. Observations over the

about 20 of the lightest such states, for a range of l that begins close to the

are well described by the spectrum of the Nambu-Goto free string theory in flat
space-time. Remarkably, this is so not only at the larger values of l, where
the gap between the ground state energy and the low-lying excitations becomes
small compared to the mass gap, but also down to much shorter lengths where
these excitation energies become large compared to sqrt(K), the flux-tube no
longer `looks' anything like a thin string, and an expansion of the effective
string action in powers of 1/l no longer converges. All this is for flux in the
fundamental representation. We also calculate the k=2 (anti)symmetric ground
states and these show larger corrections at small l. So far all this closely
resembles our earlier findings in 2+1 dimensions. However, and in contrast to
the situation in D=2+1, we also find that there are some states, with J,P=0,-
quantum numbers, that show large deviations from the Nambu-Goto spectrum. We
investigate the possibility that (some of) these states may encode the massive

high-density cores with masses larger than 10 Earth masses. According to the
conventional sequential accretion hypothesis, such massive cores are needed for
the onset of efficient accretion of their gaseous envelopes. However, Jupiter's
gaseous envelope is more massive and core may be less massive than those of
Saturn. In order to account for this structural diversity and the super-solar
metallicity in the envelope of Jupiter and Saturn, we investigate the
possibility that they may have either merged with other gas giants or consumed
several Earth-mass proto-planetary embryos during or after the rapid accretion
of their envelope. In general, impinging sub-Earth-mass planetesimals
disintegrate in gas giants' envelopes deposit heavy elements well outside the
cores and locally suppress the convection. Consequently, their fragments
sediment to promote the growth of cores. Through a series of numerical
simulations, we show that it is possible for colliding super-Earth-mass embryos
to reach the cores of gas giants. Direct parabolic collisions also lead to the
coalescence of gas giants and merging of their cores. In these cases, the
energy released from the impact leads to vigorous convective motion throughout
the envelope and the erosion of the cores. This dichotomy contributes to the
observed dispersion in the internal structure and atmospheric composition
between Jupiter and Saturn and other gas giant planets and elsewhere.

available capacity at a link is a function of not only the current arrival rate
at that link, but also of the arrival rate at links which interfere with that
link as well as of the nature of interference between these links. Models which
accurately characterize this dependence are either too computationally complex
to be useful or lack accuracy. Further, they have a high implementation
overhead and make restrictive assumptions, which makes them inapplicable to
real networks.
  In this paper, we propose CapEst, a general, simple yet accurate,
measurement-based approach to estimating link capacity in a wireless network.
To be computationally light, CapEst allows inaccuracy in estimation; however,
using measurements, it can correct this inaccuracy in an iterative fashion and
converge to the correct estimate. Our evaluation shows that CapEst always
converged to within 5% of the correct value in less than 18 iterations. CapEst
is model-independent, hence, is applicable to any MAC/PHY layer and works with
auto-rate adaptation. Moreover, it has a low implementation overhead, can be
used with any application which requires an estimate of residual capacity on a
wireless link and can be implemented completely at the network layer without
any support from the underlying chipset.

make the mode growing up to amplitudes at which particle acceleration and
stochastic heating by the drift wave take place. The stochastic heating, well
known from laboratory plasma physics where it has been confirmed in numerous
experiments, has been completely ignored in past studies of coronal heating.
However, in the present study and in our very recent works it has been shown
that the inhomogeneous coronal plasma is, in fact, a perfect environment for
fast growing drift waves. As a matter of fact, the large growth rates are
typically of the same order as the plasma frequency. The consequent heating
rates may exceed the required values for a sustained coronal heating by several
orders of magnitude. Some aspects of these phenomena are investigated here. In
particular the analysis of the particle dynamics within the growing wave is
compared with the corresponding fluid analysis. While both of them predict the
stochastic heating, the threshold for the heating obtained from the single
particle analysis is higher. The explanation for this effect is given.

terms of prior predictive values (lifetimes) and not parameter values, which
are less intuitive. The novelty of our procedure is to weigh the expert
information by the size m of a virtual sample yielding a similar information,
the prior being seen as a reference posterior. Thus, the prior calibration by
the Bayesian analyst, who has to moderate the subjective information with
respect to the data information, is made simple. A main result is the full
tractability of the prior under mild conditions, despite the conjugation issues
encountered with the Weibull distribution. Besides, m is a practical focus
point for discussion between analysts and experts, and a helpful parameter for
leading sensitivity studies and reducing the potential imbalance in posterior
selection between Bayesian Weibull models, which can be due to favoring
arbitrarily a prior. The calibration of m is discussed and a real example is

factories of antimatter in the Galaxy, in the form of pairs of electrons and
positrons. Electrons are initially extracted from the surface of the star by
the intense rotation induced electric fields and later transformed into
electron-positron pairs through electromagnetic cascading. Observations of
Pulsar Wind Nebulae (PWNe) show that cascades in the pulsar magnetosphere must
ensure pair multiplicities of order $10^{4}-10^{5}$. These pairs finally end up
as part of the relativistic magnetized wind emanating from the pulsar. The wind
is slowed down, from its highly relativistic bulk motion, at a termination
shock, which represents the reverse shock due to its interaction with the
surrounding ejecta of the progenitor supernova. At the (relativistic)
termination shock, acceleration of the pairs occurs, as part of the dissipation
process, so that the cold wind is transformed into a plasma of relativistic
non-thermal particles, plus a potential thermal component, which however has
never been observed. As long as the pulsar wind is embedded in the supernova
remnant these pairs are forced to escavate a bubble and lose energy
adiabatically (because of the expansion) and radiatively (because of magnetic
and radiation fields). We discuss here the observational constraints on the
energy and number content of such pairs and discuss the scenarios that may
allow for the pairs to escape in the interstellar medium and possibly
contribute to the positron excess that has recently been detected by the PAMELA
satellite. Special attention is dedicated to the case of Pulsar Bow Shock
Nebulae. The pairs produced in these objects may be effectively carried out of

by a balance between turbulent heating caused by the MRI and radiative cooling.
Concerning the vertical structure, two different regions can be distinguished:
A gas-pressure dominated, optically thick midplane region where most of the
dissipation takes place, and a magnetically dominated, optically thin corona
which is dominated by strong shocks. At the location of the photosphere, the
turbulence is supersonic ($M \sim 2$), which is consistent with previous
results obtained from the fitting of spectra of YSOs. It is known that the
turbulent saturation level in simulations of MRI-induced turbulence does depend
on numerical factors such as the numerical resolution and the box size.
However, by performing a suite of runs at different resolutions (using up to
64x128x512 grid cells) and with varying box sizes (with up to 16 pressure
scaleheights in the vertical direction), we find that both the saturation
levels and the heating rates show a clear trend to converge once a sufficient

term to leading order in k^2di^2 where k is wavenumber and di is ion skin
depth. A similar algebraic decay law applies to whistler perturbations in the
limit k^2di^2>>1. In a non-uniform plasma it is found that the
spatially-integrated damping rate due to phase mixing is lower in Hall MHD than
it is in MHD, but the reduction in the damping rate, which can be attributed to
the effects of wave dispersion, tends to zero in both the weak and strong phase
mixing limits.

the high energy emission of our Galaxy. Its study was one of the key scientific
objective of the SPI spectrometer on-board the INTEGRAL satellite. In fact, a
lot of observing time has been dedicated to the Galactic disk with a particular
emphasis on the central region. A crucial issue in such an analysis concerns
the reduction technique used to treat this huge quantity of data, and more
particularly the background modeling. Our method, after validation through a
variety of tests, is based on detector pattern determination per ~6 month
periods, together with a normalisation variable on a few hour timescale. The
Galactic bulge is detected at a level of ~70 sigma allowing more detailed
investigations. The main result is that the bulge morphology can be modelled
with two axisymmetric Gaussians of 3.2 deg. and 11.8 deg. FWHM and respective
fluxes of 2.5 and 5.4 x 10^-4 photons/(cm^2.s^1). We found a possible shift of
the bulge centre towards negative longitude at l=-0.6 +/- 0.2 degrees. In
addition to the bulge, a more extended structure is detected significantly with
flux ranging from 1.7 to 2.9 x10^-3 photons/(cm^2.s^1) depending on its assumed
geometry (pure disk or disk plus halo). The disk emission is also found to be
symmetric within the limits of the statistical errors.

the environment. It also provides generalized uncertainty relations, valid for
any initial state that allow a characterization of the environment in terms of

uncertainty relations are very informative about the entanglement dynamics of
Gaussian states, and to a lesser extent for other families of states. For
concreteness, we apply these techniques to a bipartite QBM model, describing
the processes of entanglement creation, disentanglement and decoherence at all

coordinate formulas to define the nilpotent groups that are central to the
calculus. Our aim in this paper is to provide insight in the intrinsic geometry
that underlies these coordinate formulas. First, we introduce `parabolic
arrows' as a generalization of tangent vectors. The definition of parabolic
arrows involves a mix of first and second order derivatives. Parabolic arrows
can be composed, and the group of parabolic arrows can be identified with the
nilpotent groups of the (generalized) Heisenberg calculus. Secondly, we
formulate a notion of exponential map for the fiber bundle of parabolic arrows,
and show how it explains the coordinate formulas of osculating structures found
in the literature on the Heisenberg calculus. The result is a conceptual
simplification and unification of the treatment of the Heisenberg calculus.

interactions between objects bound to thermally fluctuating fluid surfaces or
interfaces. This approach circumvents the complicated constraints imposed by
such objects on the functional integration measure by reverting to a point
particle representation. To capture the finite size effects, we perturb the
Hamiltonian by DH that encapsulates the particles' response to external fields.
DH is systematically expanded in a series of terms, each of which scales
homogeneously in the two power counting parameters: \lambda \equiv R/r, the
ratio of the typical object size (R) to the typical distance between them (r),
and delta=kB T/k, where k is the modulus characterizing the surface energy. The
coefficients of the terms in DH correspond to generalized polarizabilities and
thus the formalism applies to rigid as well as deformable objects.
Singularities induced by the point particle description can be dealt with using
standard renormalization techniques. We first illustrate and verify our
approach by re-deriving known pair forces between circular objects bound to
films or membranes. To demonstrate its efficiency and versatility, we then
derive a number of new results: The triplet interactions present in these
systems, a higher order correction to the film interaction, and general scaling
laws for the leading order interaction valid for objects of arbitrary shape and
internal flexibility.

form AdS_4 x X^7 and preserving at least half of the supersymmetry have been
recently classified. Requiring that amount of supersymmetry forces X to be a
spherical space form, whence isometric to the quotient of the round 7-sphere by
a freely-acting finite subgroup of SO(8). The classification is given in terms
of ADE subgroups of the quaternions embedded in SO(8) as the graph of an
automorphism. In this paper we extend this classification by dropping the
requirement that the background be smooth, so that X is now allowed to be an
orbifold of the round 7-sphere. We find that if the background preserves more
than half of the supersymmetry, then it is automatically smooth in accordance
with the homogeneity conjecture, but that there are many half-BPS orbifolds,
most of them new. The classification is now given in terms of pairs of ADE
subgroups of quaternions fibred over the same finite group. We classify such
subgroups and then describe the resulting orbifolds in terms of iterated
quotients. In most cases the resulting orbifold can be described as a sequence
of cyclic quotients.

effects should arise from reflection of X-ray emission onto the inner region of
the accretion disc surrounding the central black hole of active galactic nuclei
(AGN). The theory behind the origin of relativistic lines is well established,
and observational evidence from a moderate number of sources seems to support
the existence of these lines. The aim of this work is to establish the fraction
of AGN with relativistic Fe Kalpha lines, and study possible correlations with
source physical properties. An XMM-Newton collection of 149 radio-quiet Type 1
AGN has been systematically and uniformly analyzed in order to search for
significant evidence of a relativistically broadened Fe Kalpha line. To enable
statistical studies, an almost complete, flux-limited subsample of 31 sources
has been defined. The 2-10 keV spectra of the FERO sources have been compared
with a complex model including most of the physical components observed in the
X-ray spectra of Seyfert galaxies: a power law primary continuum modified by
non-relativistic Compton reflection and warm absorption, plus a series of
narrow Fe line reflection features. The observed fraction of sources in the
flux-limited sample that show significant evidence of a relativistic Fe Kalpha
line is 36%. The average line Equivalent Width (EW) is of the order of 100 eV,
while the average disc inclination angle is 28+/-5 deg and the average
power-law index of the radial disc emissivity law is 2.4+/-0.4. The spin value
is well constrained only in 2 cases (MCG-6-30-15 and MRK509), and in the rest
of the cases, whenever a constraint can be placed, it always implies the
rejection of the static black hole solution. The Fe Kalpha line EW does not
correlate with disc parameters or with system physical properties, such as
black hole mass, accretion rate and hard X-ray luminosity.

\emph{i.e}., the density of the observed backscattered signal given the region,
is modeled by a finite mixture of Gamma densities with a given predefined
number of components. To estimate the parameters of the class conditional
densities, a new expectation maximization algorithm was developed. The prior is
a multi-level logistic Markov random field enforcing local continuity in a
statistical sense. The smoothness parameter controlling the degree of
homogeneity imposed on the scene is automatically estimated, by computing the
evidence with loopy belief propagation; the classical coding and least squares
fit methods are also considered. The maximum a posteriori segmentation is
computed efficiently by means of recent graph-cut techniques, namely the
$\alpha$-Expansion algorithm that extends the methodology to an optional number
of classes. The effectiveness of the proposed approaches is illustrated with
simulated images and real ERS and Envisat scenes containing oil spills.
