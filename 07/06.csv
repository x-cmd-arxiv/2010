by high-resolution ac-calorimetry in binary mixtures of the liquid crystal
octylcyanobiphenyl(8CB) and a non-mesogenic, low-molecular weight, solvent
n-hexane(hex) as a function of temperature and solvent concentration. Heating
and cooling scans about the N-SmA transition temperature were repeatedly
performed on pure and six 8CB+hex samples having hexane molar concentration
ranging from x_{hex}= 0.02 to 0.12. All 8CB+hex samples in this range of
x_{hex} remain macroscopically miscible and exhibit an N-SmA heat capacity peak
that shifts non-monotonically to lower temperature and evolves in shape, with a
reproducible hysteresis, as x_{hex} increases. The imaginary part of heat
capacity remains zero up to x^{TCP}_{hex}\simeq 0.07$ above which the distinct
peak is observed, corresponding to a jump in both the real and imaginary
enthalpy. A simple power-law analysis reveals an effective exponent that
increases smoothly from 0.30 to 0.50 with an amplitude ratio
A^{-}/A^{+}\rightarrow 1 as x_{hex}\rightarrow x^{TCP}_{hex}. This observed
crossover towards the N-SmA tricritical point driven by solvent concentration
is consistent with previous results and can be understood as weakening of the
liquid crystal intermolecular potential promoting increased nematic
fluctuations.

The model reaches the SOC state and yields ion temperature profiles of
exponential shape, which exhibit very high stiffness, in that they basically
are independent of the loading pattern applied. This implies that there is
anomalous heat transport present in the system, despite the fact that diffusion
at the local level is imposed to be of a normal kind. The distributions of the

whose thermal and magnetic structure we need to decipher for unlocking new
discoveries in solar and stellar physics. To this end, we must identify and
exploit observables sensitive to weak magnetic fields (B<100 G) and to the
presence of cool and hot gas in the bulk of the solar chromosphere. Here we
report on an investigation of the Hanle effect in two semi-empirical models of
the quiet solar atmosphere with different chromospheric thermal structures. Our
study reveals that scattering polarization in the Ca II IR triplet has thermal
and magnetic sensitivities potentially of great diagnostic value. The linear
polarization in the 8498 A line shows a strong sensitivity to inclined magnetic
fields with strengths between 0.001 and 10 G, while the emergent linear
polarization in the 8542 A and 8662 A lines is mainly sensitive to magnetic
fields with strengths between 0.001 and 0.1 G. The reason for this is that the
scattering polarization of the 8542 A and 8662 A lines, unlike the 8498 A line,
is controlled mainly by the Hanle effect in their (metastable) lower levels.
Therefore, in regions with magnetic strengths sensibly larger than 1 G, their
Stokes Q and U profiles are sensitive only to the orientation of the magnetic
field vector. We also find that for given magnetic field configurations the
sign of the Q/I and U/I profiles of the 8542 A and 8662 A lines is the same in
both atmospheric models, while the sign of the linear polarization profile of
the 8498 A line turns out to be very sensitive to the thermal structure of the
lower chromosphere. We suggest that spectropolarimetric observations providing
information on the relative scattering polarization amplitudes of the Ca II IR
triplet will be very useful to improve our empirical understanding of the
thermal and magnetic structure of the quiet chromosphere.

the existing tools to estimate it suffer from several important weaknesses: i)
most tools report a point estimate of average available bandwidth over a
measurement interval and do not provide a confidence interval; ii) the commonly
adopted models used to relate the available bandwidth metric to the measured
data are invalid in almost all practical scenarios; iii) existing tools do not
scale well and are not suited to the task of multi-path estimation in
large-scale networks; iv) almost all tools use ad-hoc techniques to address
measurement noise; and v) tools do not provide enough flexibility in terms of
accuracy, overhead, latency and reliability to adapt to the requirements of
various applications. In this paper we propose a new definition for available
bandwidth and a novel framework that addresses these issues. We define
probabilistic available bandwidth (PAB) as the largest input rate at which we
can send a traffic flow along a path while achieving, with specified
probability, an output rate that is almost as large as the input rate. PAB is
expressed directly in terms of the measurable output rate and includes
adjustable parameters that allow the user to adapt to different application
requirements. Our probabilistic framework to estimate network-wide
probabilistic available bandwidth is based on packet trains, Bayesian
inference, factor graphs and active sampling. We deploy our tool on the
PlanetLab network and our results show that we can obtain accurate estimates
with a much smaller measurement overhead compared to existing approaches.

particular, the classical singularity is replaced by a quantum bounce, which
takes place in the same condition as obtained previously. We also find that

models is also studied, and we show that the use of the unimodular time

suited to adress both the anisotropic morphological character of filaments and
sheets, as well as the multiscale nature of the hierarchically evolved cosmic
matter distribution. The results of our study may be summarized as follows:
i).- While all morphologies occupy a roughly well defined range in density,
this alone is not sufficient to differentiate between them given their overlap.
Environment defined only in terms of density fails to incorporate the intrinsic
dynamics of each morphology. This plays an important role in both linear and
non linear interactions between haloes. ii).- Most of the mass in the Universe
is concentrated in filaments, narrowly followed by clusters. In terms of
volume, clusters only represent a minute fraction, and filaments not more than
9%. Walls are relatively inconspicous in terms of mass and volume. iii).- On
average, massive clusters are connected to more filaments than low mass
clusters. Clusters with $M \sim 10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$ h$^{-1}$ have on average
two connecting filaments, while clusters with $M \geq 10^{15}$ M$_{\odot}$
h$^{-1}$ have on average five connecting filaments. iv).- Density profiles
indicate that the typical width of filaments is 2$\Mpch$. Walls have less well
defined boundaries with widths between 5-8 Mpc h$^{-1}$. In their interior,
filaments have a power-law density profile with slope ${\gamma}\approx -1$,
corresponding to an isothermal density profile.

QSS occur only as a crossover phenomenon over a finite time determined by the
strength of the stochastic process. In particular, we argue that the relaxation
time to equilibrium does not scale algebraically with the system size. We
propose a scaling form for the relaxation time which is in very good agreement
with results of extensive numerical simulations. The broader validity of these

supernovae presents a challenge to supernova explosion models. In the collapsar
model for LGRBs, gamma rays are produced in an ultrarelativistic jet launching
from the magnetosphere of the black hole that forms in the aftermath of the
collapse of a rotating progenitor star. The jet is collimated along the star's
rotation axis, but the concomitant luminous supernova should be
relatively--though certainly not entirely--spherical, and should synthesize a
substantial mass of 56Ni. Our goal is to provide a qualitative assessment of
the possibility that accretion of the progenitor envelope onto the black hole,
which powers the LGRB, could also deposit sufficient energy and nickel mass in
the envelope to produce a luminous supernova. For this, the energy dissipated
near the black hole during accretion must be transported outward, where it can
drive a supernova-like shockwave. Here we suggest that the energy is
transported by convection and develop an analytical toy model, relying on
global mass and energy conservation, for the dynamics of stellar collapse. The
model suggests that a ~10,000 km/s shock can be driven into the envelope and
that ~10^51 erg explosions are possible. The efficiency with which the
accretion energy is being transferred to the envelope is governed by the
competition of advection and convection at distances ~100-1,000 km from the
black hole and is sensitive to the values of the convective mixing length, the
magnitude of the effective viscous stress, and the specific angular momentum of
the infalling envelope. Substantial masses of 56Ni may be synthesized in the
convective accretion flow over the course of tens of seconds from the initial
circularization of the infalling envelope around the black hole. The
synthesized nickel is convectively mixed with a much larger mass of unburned
ejecta.

nontrivial manner in which the two levels are mutually affecting each other

Analytical expressions for energy spectra, wavefunctions, (flux-dependent)
critical interactions for binding and current densities are derived, and these
offer the rare possibility to study persistent currents from the point of view
of an interacting nanoscopic system. Two cyclic adiabatic processes are
identified, one coupled to the center-of-mass behavior and the other defined on
the two-body interaction potential, with the associated Berry's phases also
analytically determined; these are found to be directly linked to the electric
and probability (persistent) currents in nontrivial ways that are shown to be
universal (independent of the actual form of the interaction). The direct
connection of the two-body Berry's phase to the electric current for a neutral
system is found to disappear in case of identical particles - hence revealing
the character of a charged mixture as being crucial for exhibiting these
universal behaviors.

dissipation of magnetic energy, is believed to power many disruptive phenomena
in laboratory plasma devices, the Earth magnetosphere, and the solar corona.
Traditional reconnection research, geared towards these rather tenuous
environments, has justifiably ignored the effects of radiation on the
reconnection process. However, in many reconnecting systems in high-energy
astrophysics (e.g., accretion-disk coronae, relativistic jets, magnetar flares)
and, potentially, in powerful laser plasma and z-pinch experiments, the energy
density is so high that radiation, in particular radiative cooling, may start
to play an important role. This observation motivates the development of a
theory of high-energy-density radiative magnetic reconnection. As a first step
towards this goal, we present in this paper a simple Sweet--Parker-like theory
of non-relativistic resistive-MHD reconnection with strong radiative cooling.
First, we show how, in the absence of a guide magnetic field, intense cooling
leads to a strong compression of the plasma in the reconnection layer,
resulting in a higher reconnection rate. The compression ratio and the layer
temperature are determined by the balance between ohmic heating and radiative
cooling. The lower temperature in the radiatively-cooled layer leads to a
higher Spitzer resistivity and hence to an extra enhancement of the
reconnection rate. We then apply our general theory to several specific
astrophysically important radiative processes (bremsstrahlung, cyclotron, and
inverse-Compton) in the optically thin regime, for both the zero- and
strong-guide-field cases. We derive specific expressions for key reconnection
parameters, including the reconnection rate. We also discuss the limitations
and conditions for applicability of our theory.

on joint actions. One possibility is to have the agents express their
preferences in the form of a ballot and use a voting rule to decide the winning
action(s). Unfortunately, agents may try to manipulate such an election by
misreporting their preferences. Fortunately, it has been shown that it is
NP-hard to compute how to manipulate a number of different voting rules.
However, NP-hardness only bounds the worst-case complexity. Recent theoretical
results suggest that manipulation may often be easy in practice. To address
this issue, I suggest studying empirically if computational complexity is in
practice a barrier to manipulation. The basic tool used in my investigations is
the identification of computational ""phase transitions"". Such an approach has
been fruitful in identifying hard instances of propositional satisfiability and
other NP-hard problems. I show that phase transition behaviour gives insight
into the hardness of manipulating voting rules, increasing concern that
computational complexity is indeed any sort of barrier. Finally, I look at the
problem of computing manipulation of other, related problems like stable

capable of representing relationships between terms through types. By
exploiting the ""formulas-as-types"" notion, such calculi can also encode the
correspondence between formulas and their proofs in typing judgments. As such,
these calculi provide a natural yet powerful means for specifying varied formal
systems. Such specifications can be transformed into a more direct form that
uses predicate formulas over simply typed lambda-terms and that thereby
provides the basis for their animation using conventional logic programming
techniques. However, a naive use of this idea is fraught with inefficiencies
arising from the fact that dependently typed expressions typically contain much
redundant typing information. We investigate syntactic criteria for recognizing
and, hence, eliminating such redundancies. In particular, we identify a
property of bound variables in LF types called ""rigidity"" and formally show
that checking that instantiations of such variables adhere to typing
restrictions is unnecessary for the purpose of ensuring that the overall
expression is well-formed. We show how to exploit this property in a
translation based approach to executing specifications in the Twelf language.
Recognizing redundancy is also relevant to devising compact representations of
dependently typed expressions. We highlight this aspect of our work and discuss
its connection with other approaches proposed in this context.

response is detected over the range 0-15 days, with the response confined
within the virial envelope. The Balmer-line maps have similar morphologies but
exhibit radial stratification, with progressively longer delays for Hgamma to
Hbeta to Halpha. The He I and He II response is confined within 1-2 days. There
is a deficit of prompt response in the Balmer-line cores but strong prompt
response in the red wings. Comparison with simple models identifies two classes
that reproduce these features: freefalling gas, and a half-illuminated disk
with a hotspot at small radius on the receding lune. Symmetrically illuminated
models with gas orbiting in an inclined disk or an isotropic distribution of
randomly inclined circular orbits can reproduce the virial structure but not
the observed asymmetry. Radial outflows are also largely ruled out by the
observed asymmetry. A warped-disk geometry provides a physically plausible
mechanism for the asymmetric illumination and hotspot features. Simple
estimates show that a disk in the broad-line region of Arp 151 could be
unstable to warping induced by radiation pressure. Our results demonstrate the
potential power of detailed modeling combined with monitoring campaigns at
higher cadence to characterize the gas kinematics and physical processes that

evidence of star formation going back ~1 Gyr, in agreement with previous work.
Fits to isochrones indicate a metallicity of Z ~ 0.004. The ratio of blue to

Recently, many of them have been found distributed in a thin disk structure
embedded inside the Galactic Bulge. This unexpected high density can give us
more insight into the nature and age of RCB stars. We applied and tested
successfully a new technique to find RCB stars based on the particular infrared
emission. We demonstrated that RCB stars can now be found without the need of a
light curve analysis, and therefore outside optically monitored fields. The
selection of RCB candidates was based on their near-infrared excess and on
particular mid-infrared emission of RCB shells, using photometric data from the
2MASS and Spitzer/GLIMPSE surveys. The OGLE light curves of all RCB candidates
were then inspected visually and the ones presenting large and fast declines
were followed-up spectroscopically . We discovered two new R Coronae Borealis
stars, but also propose four new candidates. We stress that all of the 7 known
RCB stars located in both Spitzer/GLIMPSE and OGLE-III fields were
re-discovered, which indicates the high efficiency of our analysis. The
proposed new technique to find RCB stars has been successful. It can now be
extented to larger area, specially where the instellar extinction is too high
to have been monitored by microlensing surveys, i.e the inner part of the

initially in the low/hard state during the first 3 months. An anti-correlated
behavior between the 2-4 keV and 4-20 keV bands were observed around January
20, 2010, indicating that the source exhibited the spectral transition to the
high/soft state. A transient radio jet may have been ejected when the source
was in the intermediate state where the spectrum was roughly explained by a
power-law with a photon index of 2.5-3.0. The unusually long period in the
initial low/hard state implies a slow variation in the mass accretion rate, and
the dramatic soft X-ray increase may be explained by a sudden appearance of the
accretion disk component with a relatively low innermost temperature (0.4-0.7
keV). Such a low temperature might suggest that the maximum accretion rate was
just above the critical gas evaporation rate required for the state transition.

agents in the system. We show the feasibility of soft control by a case study.
Consider the simple but typical distributed multi-agent model proposed by
Vicsek et al. for flocking of birds: each agent moves with the same speed but
with different headings which are updated using a local rule based on the
average of its own heading and the headings of its neighbors. Most studies of
this model are about the self-organized collective behavior, such as
synchronization of headings. We want to intervene in the collective behavior
(headings) of the group by soft control. A specified method is to add a special
agent, called a 'Shill', which can be controlled by us but is treated as an
ordinary agent by other agents. We construct a control law for the shill so
that it can synchronize the whole group to an objective heading. This control
law is proved to be effective analytically and numerically. Note that soft
control is different from the approach of distributed control. It is a natural
way to intervene in the distributed systems. It may bring out many interesting
issues and challenges on the control of complex systems.

$R_c$=88 AU and $f_c$=0.01. We suggest that the extended emission at
24.6\,$\mu$m is due to the enhanced emission from a wall-like structure at the
boundary radius (the inner edge of the outer disk), which is caused by a jump
in the surface density at $R_c$. Such reduced inner disk and geometrically
thick outer disk structure can also explain the more point-like nature at
shorter wavelengths. We also note that this disk geometry is qualitatively
similar to a pre-transitional disk, suggesting that the AB Aur disk is in a
pre-transitional disk phase.

matrix is called trimaximal. The middle column of trimaximal mixing matrix is
identical to tri-bimaximal mixing and the other two columns are subject to
unitarity constraints. This corresponds to a mixing matrix with four
independent parameters in the most general case. Apart from the two Majorana
phases, the mixing matrix has only one free parameter in the CP conserving
limit. Trimaximality results into interesting interplay between mixing angles
and CP violation. A notion of maximal CP violation naturally emerges here: CP
violation is maximal for maximal 2-3 mixing. Similarly, there is a natural
constraint on the deviation from maximal 2-3 mixing which takes its maximal
value in the CP conserving limit.

The analysis begins with the mathematical model of thick-walled cylinder

Hamiltonians are extracted by Feshbach projection over the multilevel exciton

important aspect of such a control problem is that time-delayed systems are
already infinite-dimensional before the delayed feedback control is turned on.
When the frequency of the modulation is large compared to the system's
dynamics, the analytic approach consists of relating the stability properties
of the resulting variable-delay system with those of an analogous distributed
delay system. Otherwise, the stability domains are obtained by a numerical
integration of the linearized variable-delay system. The analysis shows that
the control domains are significantly larger than those in the usual
time-delayed feedback control, and that the complexity of the domain structure
depends on the form and the frequency of the delay modulation.

  Modern software distributions are based on the notion of components, which
denote units of independent development and deployment. Components provide the
necessary flexibility when organizing a complex software distribution, but also
are a challenge when it comes to selecting components from a large repository
of possible choices, and configuring these components according to user needs,
resource constraints, and interdependencies with other components. Representing
and solving configuration problems is a hot topic of great importance for many
application domains. Some well-known examples of complex systems of components
are Free and Open Source software distributions like GNU/Linux, or Eclipse
plugins. The LoCoCo workshop has a focus on logic-based methods for specifying
and solving complex configuration problems for software components. The goal
was to bring together both researchers and practitioners active in the area of
component configuration of software systems, using different modeling and
solving techniques, such as constraint and logic programing, description
logics, satisfiability and its extensions.

approximation error depends on the smoothness of the function $f$ and the
sampling technique. For instance, Monte Carlo (MC) sampling yields a
convergence of the root mean square error (RMSE) of order $N^{-1/2}$ (where $N$
is the number of samples) for functions $f$ with finite variance. Randomized
QMC (RQMC), a combination of MC and quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC), achieves a RMSE of
order $N^{-3/2+\varepsilon}$ under the stronger assumption that the integrand
has bounded variation. A combination of RQMC with local antithetic sampling
achieves a convergence of the RMSE of order $N^{-3/2-1/s+\varepsilon}$ (where
$s\ge1$ is the dimension) for functions with mixed partial derivatives up to
order two. Additional smoothness of the integrand does not improve the rate of
convergence of these algorithms in general. On the other hand, it is known that
without additional smoothness of the integrand it is not possible to improve
the convergence rate. This paper introduces a new RQMC algorithm, for which we
prove that it achieves a convergence of the root mean square error (RMSE) of
order $N^{-\alpha-1/2+\varepsilon}$ provided the integrand satisfies the strong
assumption that it has square integrable partial mixed derivatives up to order
$\alpha>1$ in each variable. Known lower bounds on the RMSE show that this rate
of convergence cannot be improved in general for integrands with this
smoothness. We provide numerical examples for which the RMSE converges
approximately with order $N^{-5/2}$ and $N^{-7/2}$, in accordance with the
theoretical upper bound.

galaxies and analyze the internal dynamics of the cluster. We estimate a mean
redshift <z>=0.1789 and a LOS velocity dispersion \sigma ~ 1070 km/s. The
two-dimensional galaxy distribution reveals the presence of three significant
peaks within a region of ~ 1 Mpc (the E, NW, and SW peaks). The spectroscopic
catalog confirms the presence of these three clumps. The total mass of the
cluster is very uncertain: M~ 2 10^15 solar masses. The E clump well coincides
with the main mass peak as recovered from the weak gravitational lensing
analysis and is off-set to the east from the BCG by ~ 1.3 arcmin. The ROSAT
X-ray data also show a very complex structure, mainly elongated in the E-W
direction, with two (likely three) peaks in the surface brightness
distribution, which, however, are off-set from the position of the peaks in the
galaxy density. The observed phenomenology agrees with the hypothesis that we
are looking at a complex cluster merger occurring along two directions: a major
merger along the ~ E-W direction (having a component along the LOS) and a minor
merger in the western cluster regions along the ~ N-S direction, roughly
parallel to the plane of the sky.

$V(\phi,x) \approx V_0(x) + f(x) \phi(x)$ at short distances, we study the
random force (or Larkin) problem with $V_0(x) = 0$ as well as the shifted
random force problem including the random offset $V_0(x)$; as such, these
models remain well defined at all scales. Alternatively, we analyze the
harmonic approximation to the correlator $U(\phi)$ in a consistent manner.
Using direct averaging as well as the replica technique, we derive the
distribution functions ${\cal P}_{L,y}(F)$ and ${\cal P}_L(F)$ of free energies
$F$ of a polymer of length $L$ for both fixed ($\phi(L) = y$) and free boundary
conditions on the displacement field $\phi(x)$ and determine the mean

in the analysis of the harmonic approximation to the correlator are traced back
to its non-spectral correlator; we discuss how to implement this approximation
in a proper way and present a general criterion for physically admissible

applications, ranging from matching resident doctors to hospitals, to matching
students to schools, or more generally to any two-sided market. In the
classical formulation, n men and n women express their preferences (via a
strict total order) over the members of the other sex. Solving a SM problem
means finding a stable marriage where stability is an envy-free notion: no man
and woman who are not married to each other would both prefer each other to
their partners or to being single. We consider both the classical stable
marriage problem and one of its useful variations (denoted SMTI) where the men
and women express their preferences in the form of an incomplete preference
list with ties over a subset of the members of the other sex. Matchings are
permitted only with people who appear in these lists, an we try to find a
stable matching that marries as many people as possible. Whilst the SM problem
is polynomial to solve, the SMTI problem is NP-hard. We propose to tackle both
problems via a local search approach, which exploits properties of the problems
to reduce the size of the neighborhood and to make local moves efficiently. We
evaluate empirically our algorithm for SM problems by measuring its runtime
behaviour and its ability to sample the lattice of all possible stable
marriages. We evaluate our algorithm for SMTI problems in terms of both its
runtime behaviour and its ability to find a maximum cardinality stable
marriage.For SM problems, the number of steps of our algorithm grows only as
O(nlog(n)), and that it samples very well the set of all stable marriages. It
is thus a fair and efficient approach to generate stable marriages.Furthermore,
our approach for SMTI problems is able to solve large problems, quickly
returning stable matchings of large and often optimal size despite the
NP-hardness of this problem.

proposed. In contrast with the flat fading Rayleigh case, no closed-form
expressions for the eigenvectors of the optimum input covariance matrix are
available. Classically, both the eigenvectors and eigenvalues are computed
numerically and the corresponding optimization algorithms remain
computationally very demanding. In this paper, it is proposed to optimize
(w.r.t. the input covariance matrix) a large system approximation of the
average mutual information derived by Moustakas and Simon. The validity of this
asymptotic approximation is clarified thanks to Gaussian large random matrices
methods. It is shown that the approximation is a strictly concave function of
the input covariance matrix and that the average mutual information evaluated
at the argmax of the approximation is equal to the capacity of the channel up
to a O(1/t) term, where t is the number of transmit antennas. An algorithm
based on an iterative waterfilling scheme is proposed to maximize the average
mutual information approximation, and its convergence studied. Numerical
simulation results show that, even for a moderate number of transmit and
receive antennas, the new approach provides the same results as direct
maximization approaches of the average mutual information.

important biological insights, such as the presence of hubs and hierarchical
modularity. There is also a growing interest in studying the statistical
properties of networks in the context of cancer genomics. However, relatively
little is known as to what network features differ between the cancer and
normal cell physiologies, or between different cancer cell phenotypes. Based on
the observation that frequent genomic alterations underlie a more aggressive
cancer phenotype, we asked if such an effect could be detectable as an increase
in the randomness of local gene expression patterns. Using a breast cancer gene
expression data set and a model network of protein interactions we derive
constrained weighted networks defined by a stochastic information flux matrix
reflecting expression correlations between interacting proteins. Based on this
stochastic matrix we propose and compute an entropy measure that quantifies the
degree of randomness in the local pattern of information flux around single
genes. By comparing the local entropies in the non-metastatic versus metastatic
breast cancer networks, we here show that breast cancers that metastasize are
characterised by a small yet significant increase in the degree of randomness
of local expression patterns. We validate this result in three additional
breast cancer expression data sets and demonstrate that local entropy better
characterises the metastatic phenotype than other non-entropy based measures.
We show that increases in entropy can be used to identify genes and signalling
pathways implicated in breast cancer metastasis. Further exploration of such
integrated cancer expression and protein interaction networks will therefore be
a fruitful endeavour.

IIB matrix model, which was proposed as a non-perturbative formulation of type
IIB superstring theory, and the spontaneous breaking corresponds to the
dynamical compactification of space-time suggested in that model. First we
study the D = 6 case by the Gaussian expansion method, which turns out to yield
clearer results than the previous results for the D = 10 case for certain
technical reasons. By comparing the free energy of the SO(d) symmetric vacua
for d = 2, 3, 4, 5, we conclude that the breaking SO(6) \to SO(3) actually
occurs. We find that the extent of space-time in the shrunken directions is
almost independent of d. In units of this universal scale, the extended
directions seem to have large but still finite extents depending on d. We show
that these results for the extent of space-time can be explained quantitatively
by an argument based on the low-energy effective theory. With these new
insights, we reconsider the previous results for the IIB matrix model, and find
that they are also consistent with our argument based on the low-energy
effective theory. Thus we arrive at comprehensive understanding and some
quantitative predictions concerning the nature of the spontaneous symmetry
breaking taking place in these models. The space-time picture that emerges from
the IIB matrix model and its implication on possible interpretations of the

coordinates. It turns out that also the wave-mechanical description of a system

by a general twist-induced *-deformation procedure which deforms in a
coordinated way not just the spacetime algebra, but the larger algebra

particle creation and annihilation operators. On the deformed algebra the
action of the original spacetime transformations looks twisted. In a

while the ratios of the hard X-ray to [OIII], [OIV], and MIR fluxes are
systematically low by about an order-of-magnitude in the Type 2 AGN, indicating
that hard X-ray selected samples do not represent the full Type 2 AGN

diagnostics of the relative energetic contributions of AGN and star formation
processes in our samples of Type 2 AGN. We find good agreement between the
various diagnostic parameters, such as the equivalent width of the MIR
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon features, the ratio of the MIR [OIV]/[NeII]

prediction of the relative strengths of the 620.701 GHz and the 22.235 GHz
maser components of ortho water vapour. METHODS: In its high-resolution mode
(HRS) the Herschel Heterodyne Instrument for the Infrared (HIFI) offers a
frequency resolution of 0.125 MHz, corresponding to a line-of-sight velocity of
0.06 km/s, which we employed to obtain the strength and linear polarisation of
maser spikes in the spectrum of VY CMa at 620.701 GHz. Simultaneous ground
based observations of the 22.235 GHz maser with the Max-Planck-Institut f\""ur

to date of water vapour maser emission at 620.701 GHz. In VY CMa both the
620.701 and the 22.235 GHz polarisation are weak. At 620.701 GHz the maser
peaks are superposed on what appears to be a broad emission component, jointly
ejected asymmetrically from the star. We observed the 620.701 GHz emission at
two epochs 21 days apart, both to measure the potential direction of linearly
polarised maser components and to obtain a measure of the longevity of these
components. Although we do not detect significant polarisation levels in the
core of the line, they rise up to approximately 6% in its wings.

correlations between the peak brightness of an event and the age of the
progenitor stellar population. This trend likely follows from properties of the
progenitor white dwarf (WD), such as central density, that follow from
properties of the host stellar population. We present a statistically
well-controlled, systematic study utilizing a suite of multi-dimensional SNeIa
simulations investigating the influence of central density of the progenitor WD
on the production of Fe-group material, particularly radioactive Ni-56, which
powers the light curve. We find that on average, as the progenitor's central
density increases, production of Fe-group material does not change but
production of Ni-56 decreases. We attribute this result to a higher rate of
neutronization at higher density. The central density of the progenitor is
determined by the mass of the WD and the cooling time prior to the onset of
mass transfer from the companion, as well as the subsequent accretion heating
and neutrino losses. The dependence of this density on cooling time, combined
with the result of our central density study, offers an explanation for the
observed age-luminosity correlation: a longer cooling time raises the central
density at ignition thereby producing less Ni-56 and thus a dimmer event. While
our ensemble of results demonstrates a significant trend, we find considerable
variation between realizations, indicating the necessity for averaging over an
ensemble of simulations to demonstrate a statistically significant result.

that a very efficient way to grow protoplanets is by accreting particles of
size <<km (e.g., chondrules, boulders, or fragments of larger bodies) as they
can be kept dynamically cold. We investigate the effects of gas drag on the
impact radii and the accretion rates of these particles. As simplifying
assumptions we restrict our analysis to 2D settings, a gas drag law linear in
velocity, and a laminar disk characterized by a smooth (global) pressure
gradient that causes particles to drift in radially. These approximations,
however, enable us to cover an arbitrary large parameter space. The framework
of the circularly restricted three body problem is used to numerically
integrate particle trajectories and to derive their impact parameters. Three
accretion modes can be distinguished: hyperbolic encounters, where the 2-body
gravitational focusing enhances the impact parameter; three-body encounters,
where gas drag enhances the capture probability; and settling encounters, where
particles settle towards the protoplanet. An analysis of the observed behavior
is presented; and we provide a recipe to analytically calculate the impact
radius, which confirms the numerical findings. We apply our results to the
sweepup of fragments by a protoplanet at a distance of 5 AU. Accretion of
debris on small protoplanets (<50 km) is found to be slow, because the
fragments are distributed over a rather thick layer. However, the newly found
settling mechanism, which is characterized by much larger impact radii, becomes
relevant for protoplanets of ~10^3 km in size and provides a much faster
channel for growth.

Despite a number of novel, theoretical advances, it has been unclear if and how

a technique which makes it possible to decide if a program conforms to a

optical cavity is a process akin to crystallization: when pumped by a laser of
sufficient intensity, the coupled matter and light fields evolve,
spontaneously, into a spatially modulated pattern, or crystal, whose lattice
structure is dictated by the geometry of the cavity. In cavities having
multiple degenerate modes, the quasi-continuum of possible lattice
arrangements, and the continuous symmetry breaking associated with the adoption
of a particular lattice arrangement, give rise to phenomena such as phonons,
defects, and frustration, which have hitherto been unexplored in ultracold
atomic settings involving neutral atoms. The present work develops a
nonequilibrium field-theoretic approach to explore the self-organization of a
BEC in a pumped, lossy optical cavity. We find that the transition is well
described, in the regime of primary interest, by an effective equilibrium
theory. At nonzero temperatures, the self-organization occurs via a
fluctuation-driven first-order phase transition of the Brazovskii class; this
transition persists to zero temperature, and crosses over into a quantum phase
transition of a new universality class. We make further use of our
field-theoretic description to investigate the role of nonequilibrium
fluctuations on the self-organization transition, as well as to explore the
nucleation of ordered-phase droplets, the nature and energetics of topological
defects, supersolidity in the ordered phase, and the possibility of frustration
controlled by the cavity geometry. In addition, we discuss the range of
experimental parameters for which we expect the phenomena described here to be
observable, along with possible schemes for detecting ordering and fluctuations
via either atomic correlations or the correlations of the light emitted from
the cavity.

be involved. HR Del was thus monitored over several years, both in broad band
photometry and spectroscopically in the H$\alpha$ spectral region. The profile
of the H$\alpha$ line shows two components: a narrow, central component; and
broader wings. The former is most easily understood as being due to an
accretion disk, whose geometry might lead to it partly occulting itself. That
component shows something like an S wave with an orbital phase dependance,
suggesting that it could be due to a spot bright in H$\alpha$. The wide
component must come from another region, with a probably non-negligible
contribution from the material ejected during the 1967 outburst. Non-orbital
variations of the H$\alpha$ equivalent width were found both on long and short
time scales. Similar variations were found in the photometry, showing a
component with a clear dependence on the orbital phase, but no obvious relation

first for near-circular orbits as a natural expansion of an existing orbital
model for low-eccentricity binary systems. The amplitudes of the 3rd and higher
harmonics can be described by two new post-Keplerian (PK) parameters
proportional to the amplitudes of the third and fourth harmonics (h_3, h_4).
For high orbital inclinations we use a PK parameter proportional to the ratio
of amplitudes of successive harmonics (sigma) instead of h_4. The new PK
parameters are much less correlated with each other than r and s and provide a
superior description of the constraints introduced by the Shapiro delay on the
orbital inclination and the masses of the components of the binary (...). We
extend the h_3,sigma parameterisation to eccentric binaries with high orbital
inclinations. For some such binaries we can measure extra PK parameters and
test general relativity using the Shapiro delay parameters. In this case we can
use the measurement of h_3 as a test of general relativity. We show that this
new test is not only more stringent than the r test, but it is even more
stringent than the previous s test. Until now this new parametric test could
only be derived statistically from an analysis of a probabilistic chi2 map.
