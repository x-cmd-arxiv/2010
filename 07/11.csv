dark matter and bilinear R-parity violation, gravitinos with masses below Mw
typically decay with a sizable branching ratio into the 3-body final states
W^*+lepton and Z^*+neutrino. In this paper we study the indirect detection
signatures of gravitino dark matter including such final states. First, we
obtain the gamma ray spectrum from gravitino decays, which features a
monochromatic contribution from the decay into photon+neutrino and a continuum
contribution from the three-body decays. After studying its dependence on
supersymmetric parameters, we compute the expected gamma ray fluxes and derive
new constraints, from recent FERMI data, on the R-parity breaking parameter and
on the gravitino lifetime. Indirect detection via antimatter searches, a new
possibility brought about by the three-body final states, is also analyzed. For
models compatible with the gamma ray observations, the positron signal is found
to be negligible whereas the antiproton one can be significant.

Corona. We have obtained 16 new mid-eclipse time measurements of this source
during the last 13 years using X- ray observations made with the RXTE-PCA,
RXTE-ASM, Swift-XRT, XMM-Newton and Chandra observatories. These, along with
the earlier known mid-eclipse times have been used to accurately determine the
timescale for a change in the orbital period of 4U 1822-37. We have derived an
orbital period Porb = 0.23210887(15) d, which is changing at the rate of \cdot
Porb = 1.3(3) x 10-10 d d-1 (at T0 = MJD 45614). The timescale for a change in
the orbital period is Porb/ \cdot Porb of 4.9(1.1) x 106 yr. We also report the
detection of 0.59290132(11) s (at T0 = MJD 51975) X-ray pulsations from the
source with a long term average \cdot Pspin of -2.481(4) x 10-12 s s-1, i.e., a
spin-up time scale (Pspin/ \cdot Pspin) of 7578(13) yr. In view of these
results, we have discussed various mechanisms that could be responsible for the
orbital evolution in this system. Assuming the extreme case of conservative
mass transfer, we have found that the measured \cdot Porb requires a large mass
transfer rate of (4.2 - 5.2) x 10-8 M\odot yr-1 which together with the spin up
rate implies a magnetic field strength in the range of (1-3) x 108 G. Using the
long term RXTE-ASM light curve, we have found that the X-ray intensity of the
source has decreased over the last 13 years by ? 40% and there are long term
fluctuations at time scales of about a year. In addition to the long term
intensity variation, we have also observed significant variation in the

(DE-SCo), that provide a flexible tradeoff between the channel quality and
receiver delay. When the channel conditions are good, the source stream is
recovered with a low delay, whereas when the channel conditions are poor the
source stream is still recovered, albeit with a larger delay. Information

that DE-SCo achieve the minimum possible delay for the weaker user, without

particle displacements due to inviscid swimmers are added to produce an
effective diffusivity. Here we show that for the viscous case the swimmers
cannot be assumed to swim an infinite distance, even though their total mass
displacement is finite. Instead, the largest contributions to particle
displacement, and hence to mixing, arise from random changes of direction of
swimming and are dominated by the far-field stresslet term in our simple model.
We validate the results by numerical simulation. We also calculate nonzero
Reynolds number corrections to the effective diffusivity. Finally, we show that
displacements due to randomly-swimming squirmers exhibit PDFs with exponential
tails and a short-time superdiffusive regime, as found previously by several
authors. In our case, the exponential tails are due to 'sticking' near the
stagnation points on the squirmer's surface.

chemical states, and in each chemical state, the motor moves forward or
backward in a corresponding potential. So, mathematically, the motion of
molecular motor can be described by several coupled one-dimensional hopping

Actually, many of the existing models, such as the flashing ratchet model, can

velocity, we find that the mean velocity of molecular motor might be nonzero

energy input to the molecular motor in each of the two states. At the same
time, the mean velocity might be zero even if there is energy input to the

the potentials (or corresponding forward and backward transition rates) in the
two states, but also on the transition rates between the two chemical states.

in introductory physics - a free particle, a uniformly accelerating particle,
and a simple harmonic oscillator - we present families of trial world-lines,
characterized by a few parameters, that evolve continuously from their
respective classical world-lines. With explicit analytical expressions
available for the action, they permit a graphical visualization of the action
landscape in the space of nearby world-lines. Although these trial world-lines
form only a subset of the space of all nearby world-lines, they provide a
pedagogical tool that complements the traditional Lagrange equation approach
and is well-suited for advanced undergraduate students.

categorization of the different ways in which entanglement can disappear in the
course of the evolution, e.g., entanglement sudden death. The dynamics is
described by the function ~n(t), where ~n is the 15-dimensional polarization
vector. This representation is particularly useful because the components of ~n
are direct physical observables, there is a meaningful notion of orthogonality,
and the concurrence C can be computed for any point in the space. We analyze
the topology of the space S of separable states (those having C = 0), and the
often lower-dimensional linear dynamical subspace D that is characteristic of a
specific physical model. This allows us to give a rigorous characterization of
the four possible kinds of entanglement evolution. Which evolution is realized
depends on the dimensionality of D and of D \cap S, the position of the
asymptotic point of the evolution, and whether or not the evolution is
""distance-Markovian"", a notion we define. We give several examples to
illustrate the general principles, and to give a method to compute critical
points. We construct a model that shows all four behaviors.

in physics since that discovery. We propose cosmological models that can simply
and elegantly explain the cosmic acceleration via the geometric structure of
the spacetime continuum, without introducing a cosmological constant into the
standard Einstein field equation, negating the necessity for the existence of
dark energy. In this geometry, the three fundamental physical dimensions
length, time, and mass are related in new kind of relativity. There are four
conspicuous features of these models: 1) the speed of light and the
gravitational constant are not constant, but vary with the evolution of the
universe, 2) time has no beginning and no end; i.e., there is neither a big
bang nor a big crunch singularity, 3) the spatial section of the universe is a
3-sphere, and 4) in the process of evolution, the universe experiences phases
of both acceleration and deceleration. One of these models is selected and
tested against current cosmological observations, and is found to fit the
redshift- luminosity distance data quite well.

we studied the effects of Reimers mass loss, binary interactions, star
formation rate and the mixing-length parameter on the distributions of the
{\nu}_max and {\Delta}{\nu} of red-clump stars. The Reimers mass loss can
result in an increase in the {\nu}_max and {\Delta}{\nu} of old population
which lost a considerable amount of mass. However, it leads to a small decrease
in those of middle-age population which lost a little bit of mass. Furthermore,
a high mass-loss rate impedes the low-mass and low-metal stars evolving into
core-helium burning (CHeB) stage. Both Reimers mass loss and star formation
rate mainly affect the number of CHeB stars with {\nu}_max and {\Delta}{\nu},
but hardly affect the peak locations of {\nu}_max and {\Delta}{\nu}. Binary
interactions also can lead to an increase or decrease in the {\nu}_max and
{\Delta}{\nu} of some stars. However, the fraction of CHeB stars undergoing
binary interactions is very small in our simulations. Therefore, the peak
locations are also not affected by binary interactions. The non-uniform
distributions of {\nu}_max and {\Delta}{\nu} are mainly caused by the most of
red-clump stars having an approximate radius rather than mass. The radius of
red-clump stars decreases with increasing the mixing-length parameter. The peak

through synchrotron emission from a transient population of accelerated

inverse compton, or synchrotron emission associated with the transient
electrons. Here I consider the upscattering of infrared flare photons by
relativistic thermal electrons in the accretion flow around Sgr A*. Typical
profiles of electron density and temperature in the accretion flow are adopted
and the X-ray light curves produced by upscattering of infrared flare photons
by the accretion flow are computed. Peak X-ray luminosities between 1e33 and
1e34 erg/s are attained for a 10 mJy near-infrared flare, compatible with
observed coincident infrared/X-ray flares from Sgr A*. Even if this process is
not responsible for the observed flares it still presents a serious constraint
on accretion flow models, which must avoid over-producing X-rays and also
predicting observable time lags between flaring in infrared and in X-rays.
Future high-resolution infrared instrumentation will be able to place the
location of the infrared flare and in coordination with the X-ray would
severely constrain the disc geometry and the radial profiles of electron

Observatory (ESO) and determine their angular separation to a precision of 10
micro arcseconds in only 5 minutes. To perform the astrometric measurement with
such a high accuracy, the differential path length through the VLTI and the
instrument has to be measured (and tracked since Earth's rotation will
permanently change it) by a laser metrology to an even higher level of accuracy
(corresponding to 1 nm in 3 minutes). Usually, heterodyne differential path
techniques are used for nanometer precision measurements, but with these
methods it is difficult to track the full beam size and to follow the light
path up to the primary mirror of the telescope. Here, we present the
preliminary design of a differential path metrology system, developed within
the GRAVITY project. It measures the instrumental differential path over the
full pupil size and up to the entrance pupil location. The differential phase
is measured by detecting the laser fringe pattern both on the telescopes'
secondary mirrors as well as after reflection at the primary mirror. Based on
our proposed design we evaluate the phase measurement accuracy based on a full
budget of possible statistical and systematic errors. We show that this
metrology design fulfills the high precision requirement of GRAVITY.

cover information from satellite imagery. Most of the initial research has
focussed on the development and application of algorithms to better existing
and emerging classifiers. In this paper, a paradigm shift is proposed whereby a
committee of classifiers is used to determine the final classification output.
Two of the key components of an ensemble system are that there should be
diversity among the classifiers and that there should be a mechanism through
which the results are combined. In this paper, the members of the ensemble
system include: Linear SVM, Gaussian SVM and Quadratic SVM. The final output
was determined through a simple majority vote of the individual classifiers.
From the results obtained it was observed that the final derived map generated
by an ensemble system can potentially improve on the results derived from the
individual classifiers making up the ensemble system. The ensemble system
classification accuracy was, in this case, better than the linear and quadratic
SVM result. It was however less than that of the RBF SVM. Areas for further
research could focus on improving the diversity of the ensemble system used in
this research.

papers and the corresponding data collected from more than four thousands
experiments. Two series of experiments were designed in order to study the
relationship between different parameters which can affect different paths of
motion in leaves. In the first series of experiments, the shapes of the
potential paths that falling papers can take were investigated as a whole. A
new classification scheme was derived from these experiments, categorizing the
motion of falling sheets of paper based on the deviation from the original
point of release and the shape of the path they take on their descending
journey. We believe this new classification scheme can be very useful with
potential applications in various fields such as biology, meteorology, etc.; it
can also build a foundation for further experiments. The second set of
experiments was focused on the dynamics and shape of the motion of the falling
paper itself. It was observed from these experiments that there should be two
critical values for Froude number in the falling paper motion in regards to the
rotational motion. We also found that the most stable and dominant rotational
motions are those observed around the length axis as well as the ones along the
diagonal axis.

$\beta^*$ under a gaussian noise model, for the purpose of both prediction and
model selection. We assume that prior knowledge is available on the sparsity
pattern, namely the set of variables is partitioned into prescribed groups,
only few of which are relevant in the estimation process. This group sparsity
assumption suggests us to consider the Group Lasso method as a means to
estimate $\beta^*$. We establish oracle inequalities for the prediction and
$\ell_2$ estimation errors of this estimator. These bounds hold under a
restricted eigenvalue condition on the design matrix. Under a stronger
coherence condition, we derive bounds for the estimation error for mixed
$(2,p)$-norms with $1\le p\leq \infty$. When $p=\infty$, this result implies
that a threshold version of the Group Lasso estimator selects the sparsity
pattern of $\beta^*$ with high probability. Next, we prove that the rate of
convergence of our upper bounds is optimal in a minimax sense, up to a
logarithmic factor, for all estimators over a class of group sparse vectors.
Furthermore, we establish lower bounds for the prediction and $\ell_2$
estimation errors of the usual Lasso estimator. Using this result, we
demonstrate that the Group Lasso can achieve an improvement in the prediction
and estimation properties as compared to the Lasso.

mixing of two coherent electromagnetic waves is being considered. The

rectification of the waves at high frequencies is quite smooth whiles at low
frequencies there are some fluctuations. The nonohmicity observed in the
I-Vcharacteristics is attributed to the nonparabolicity of the electron energy
band which is very strong in carbon nanotubes because of high stark component.
It is observed that the current falls off faster at lower electric field than
the case in superlattice. For omega tau equal to two? the external electric
field strength Emax for the observation of negative differential conductivity
occurs around 1.03x10e6 V/m which is quite weak. It is interesting to note that
the peak of the curve shifts to the left with increasing value of omega tau?

constrain the mixing efficiencies in massive stars on the main sequence,
because moderate mixing at the surface leads to a depletion of light elements
but only later to an enrichment in nitrogen. Aims. We want to test the
rotational mixing prescriptions included in the Geneva stellar evolution code
(GENEC) by following the evolution of surface abundances of light isotopes in
massive stars. Methods. The GENEC is a 1D code containing sophisticated
prescriptions for rotational mixing. We implemented an extended reaction
network into this code including the light elements Li, Be and B, which allowed
us to perform calculations testing the rotation induced mixing. Results. We
followed 9, 12 and 15 solar mass models with rotation from the zero age main
sequence up to the end of He burning. The calculations show the expected
behaviour with faster depletion of light isotopes for faster rotating stars and
more massive stars. Conclusions. We find that the mixing prescriptions used in
the present rotating models for massive single stars can account for most of
the observations. However the uncertainties are quite large making it hard to
draw a firm conclusion on the mixing scenario.

be artificially enhanced by creating defects, as by Ion Beam Sputtering (IBS)

solid target, eroding its surface and inducing formation of nanometric
structures. Recent experiments have challenged knowledge accumulated during the

demonstrating a controllable instance of solid flow at the nanoscale. This new
