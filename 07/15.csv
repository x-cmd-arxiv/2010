inserted to form a binary tree with the heap property, where each insertion
subsequent to the first occurs at a leaf of the tree, i.e. below a previously
placed number. In this paper we consider a variety of problems related to
heapable sequences and subsequences that do not appear to have been studied
previously. Our motivation for introducing these concepts is two-fold. First,
such problems correspond to natural extensions of the well-known secretary
problem for hiring an organization with a hierarchical structure. Second, from
a purely combinatorial perspective, our problems are interesting variations on
similar longest increasing subsequence problems, a problem paradigm that has
led to many deep mathematical connections.
  We provide several basic results. We obtain an efficient algorithm for
determining the heapability of a sequence, and also prove that the question of
whether a sequence can be arranged in a complete binary heap is NP-hard.
Regarding subsequences we show that, with high probability, the longest
heapable subsequence of a random permutation of n numbers has length (1 - o(1))
n, and a subsequence of length (1 - o(1)) n can in fact be found online with
high probability. We similarly show that for a random permutation a subsequence
that yields a complete heap of size \alpha n for a constant \alpha can be found
with high probability. Our work highlights the interesting structure underlying
this class of subsequence problems, and we leave many further interesting
variations open for future work.

0.918 when applying the Brodsky, Lepage, and Mackenzie(BLM) renormalization

the contributions from the next-dominant ones, the photon and gluon

$(7.3 \sim 10.0)\times 10^{-5}$ with the uncertainty consideration for the
renormalization scale and Charm quark mass. The results are about half of the
central value of the experimental measurement 2.1$\times10^{-4}$. Furthermore,
the $J/\psi$ energy distribution in our calculation is not well consistent with
the experimental data. Therefore, even at QCD NLO, the contribution to $Z \to
J/\psi_{prompt}+X$ from the CSM can not fully account for the experimental

the color-octet(COM) contributions. We define $R_{c\bar{c}}=\frac{\Gamma(Z \to

of geometric programming. The algorithms are based on a generic principle for
optimization called the MM algorithm. In this setting, one can apply the
geometric-arithmetic mean inequality and a supporting hyperplane inequality to
create a surrogate function with parameters separated. Thus, unconstrained
signomial programming reduces to a sequence of one-dimensional minimization
problems. Simple examples demonstrate that the MM algorithm derived can
converge to a boundary point or to one point of a continuum of minimum points.
Conditions under which the minimum point is unique or occurs in the interior of
parameter space are proved for geometric programming. Convergence to an
interior point occurs at a linear rate. Finally, the MM framework easily
accommodates equality and inequality constraints of signomial type. For the
most important special case, constrained quadratic programming, the MM
algorithm involves very simple updates.

to be observable in the currently operating and future planned accelerator
experiments (including LHC) due to the existence of very strong constraints on
the parameters and couplings responsible for the corresponding $|\Delta L| = 2$
processes, $L$ being the total lepton charge. If the heavy Majorana neutrinos
$N_j$ are observed and they are associated only with the type I or inverse
see-saw mechanisms and no additional TeV scale ""new physics"", they will behave
like Dirac fermions to a relatively high level of precision, being actually
pseudo-Dirac particles. The observation of effects proving the Majorana nature
of $N_j$ would imply that these heavy neutrinos have additional relatively
strong couplings to the Standard Model particles (as, e.g. in the type III
see-saw scenario), or that light neutrino masses compatible with the
observations are generated by a mechanism other than see-saw (e.g., radiatively
at one or two loop level) in which the heavy Majorana neutrinos $N_j$ are
nevertheless involved.

reconnection with closed loops. In order to test the latter idea, we developed
Monte Carlo simulations of the photospheric ""magnetic carpet"" and extrapolated
the time-varying coronal field. These models were constructed for a range of
different magnetic flux imbalance ratios. Completely balanced models represent
quiet regions on the Sun and source regions of slow solar wind streams. Highly
imbalanced models represent coronal holes and source regions of fast wind
streams. The models agree with observed emergence rates, surface flux
densities, and number distributions of magnetic elements. Despite having no
imposed supergranular motions, a realistic network of magnetic ""funnels""
appeared spontaneously. We computed the rate at which closed field lines open
up (i.e., recycling times for open flux), and we estimated the energy flux
released in reconnection events involving the opening up of closed flux tubes.
For quiet regions and mixed-polarity coronal holes, these energy fluxes were
found to be much lower than required to accelerate the solar wind. For the most
imbalanced coronal holes, the energy fluxes may be large enough to power the
solar wind, but the recycling times are far longer than the time it takes the
solar wind to accelerate into the low corona. Thus, it is unlikely that either
the slow or fast solar wind is driven by reconnection and loop-opening
processes in the magnetic carpet.

there is no enhanced symmetry in the full nonlinear theory. We then argue that

graviton mass values and the full nonlinear theory might be unitary for all
values of the graviton mass and the Hubble parameter with no van

studying full nonlinear Hamiltonian for the relevant conformal and helicity-0

a generator f(y, z) which can be neither locally monotone in the variable y nor

in a fourfold way: astronomical observations of DM structures (galaxy
properties, halos, rotation curves and density profiles), DM numerical
simulations (with and without baryons), theoretical astrophysics and cosmology
(kinetic theory, Boltzmann-Vlasov evolution), astroparticle physics. Peter
Biermann, Alfonso Cavaliere, Hector J. de Vega, Gianfranco Gentile, Chandra
Jog, Andrea Lapi, Paolo Salucci, Norma G. Sanchez, Pasquale Serpico, Rainer
Stiele, Janine van Eymeren and Markus Weber present here their highlights of
the Workshop. The summary and conclusions by H. J. de Vega and N. G. Sanchez
stress among other points the growing evidence that DM particles have a mass in
the keV scale and that those keV scale particles naturally produce the small
scale structures observed in galaxies. Wimps (DM particles heavier than 1 GeV)
are strongly disfavoured combining theory with galaxy astronomical
observations. Peter Biermann presents his live minutes of the Workshop and
concludes that a right-handed sterile neutrino of mass of a few keV is the most
interesting DM candidate. Photos of the Workshop are included.

spectrum of the dilatation operator in a CFT. Such an effective theory is
useful when the spectrum contains a hierarchy in the dimension of operators,
and a small parameter whose role is similar to that of 1/N in a large N gauge
theory. These criteria insure that there is a regime where the dilatation
operator is modified perturbatively. Global AdS is the natural framework for
perturbations of the dilatation operator respecting conformal invariance, much
as Minkowski space naturally describes Lorentz invariant perturbations of the
Hamiltonian. Assuming that the lowest-dimension single-trace operator is a
scalar, O, we consider the anomalous dimensions, gamma(n,l), of the
double-trace operators of the form O (del^2)^n (del)^l O. Purely from the CFT
we find that perturbative unitarity places a bound on these dimensions of
|gamma(n,l)|<4. Non-renormalizable AdS interactions lead to violations of the
bound at large values of n. We also consider the case that these interactions
are generated by integrating out a heavy scalar field in AdS. We show that the
presence of the heavy field ""unitarizes"" the growth in the anomalous
dimensions, and leads to a resonance-like behavior in gamma(n,l) when n is
close to the dimension of the CFT operator dual to the heavy field. Finally, we
demonstrate that bulk flat-space S-matrix elements can be extracted from the
large n behavior of the anomalous dimensions. This leads to a direct connection
between the spectrum of anomalous dimensions in d-dimensional CFTs and
flat-space S-matrix elements in d+1 dimensions. We comment on the emergence of
flat-space locality from the CFT perspective.

electronic Fermi surface. Interestingly in some situations a `ghost' Fermi
surface of electrically neutral spin carrying fermions may survive into the
insulator. Such a novel ghost Fermi surface has been proposed to underlie the
properties of a few different materials but its direct detection has proven
elusive. In this paper we show that the ghost Fermi surface leads to slowly
decaying spatial oscillations of the electron density near impurities or other
defects. These and related oscillations stem from the sharpness of the ghost
Fermi surface and are direct analogs of the familiar Friedel oscillations in
metals. The oscillation period contains geometric information about the shape
of the ghost Fermi surface which can be potentially exploited to detect its
existence.

the clustering of galaxies that is not available to its lower order cousin, the

3PCF, are necessary to probe the non-Gaussian structure and shape information
expected in these distributions. We measure the clustering of spectroscopic
galaxies in the Main Galaxy Sample of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS),
focusing on the shape or configuration dependence of the reduced 3PCF in both
redshift and projected space. This work constitutes the largest number of
galaxies ever used to investigate the reduced 3PCF, using over 220,000 galaxies
in three volume-limited samples. We find significant configuration dependence
of the reduced 3PCF at 3-27 Mpc/h, in agreement with LCDM predictions and in
disagreement with the hierarchical ansatz. Below 6 Mpc/h, the redshift space
reduced 3PCF shows a smaller amplitude and weak configuration dependence in
comparison with projected measurements suggesting that redshift distortions,
and not galaxy bias, can make the reduced 3PCF appear consistent with the
hierarchical ansatz. The reduced 3PCF shows a weaker dependence on luminosity
than the 2PCF, with no significant dependence on scales above 9 Mpc/h. On
scales less than 9 Mpc/h, the reduced 3PCF appears more affected by galaxy
color than luminosty. We demonstrate the extreme sensitivity of the 3PCF to
systematic effects such as sky completeness and binning scheme, along with the
difficulty of resolving the errors. Some comparable analyses make assumptions
that do not consistently account for these effects.

layer in a protoplanetary disks demands that there be local patches where dust
is concentrated by a factor of $\sim$ a few $\times 10^3$ over the background
value. Vortices in protoplanetary disks may concentrate dust to these values
allowing them to be the nurseries of planetesimals. The concentration of dust
in the cores of vortices increases the dust-gas ratio of the core compared to
the background disk, creating a ""heavy vortex."" In this work, we show that
these vortices are subject to an instability which we have called the
heavy-core instability. Using Floquet theory, we show that this instability
occurs in elliptical protoplanetary vortices when the gas-dust density of the
core of the vortex is heavier than the ambient gas-dust density by a few tens
of percent. The heavy-core instability grows very rapidly, with a growth
timescale of a few vortex rotation periods. While the nonlinear evolution of
this instability remains unknown, it will likely increase the velocity
dispersion of the dust layer in the vortex because instability sets in well
before sufficient dust can gather to form a protoplanetary seed. This
instability may thus preclude vortices from being sites of planetesimal
formation.

splitting. This means that the additional mass eigenstate could, with small
mixings, be located among the known ones, as it is suggested by the recent
analysis of cosmological data. We use a self-consistent framework at the
Neutrino Factory without any constraints on the new parameters. We demonstrate
for a combined short and long baseline setup that near detectors can provide
the expected sensitivity at the LSND-motivated \Delta m_{41}^2-range, while
some sensitivity can also be obtained in the region of the atmospheric mass
splitting from the long baselines. We point out that limits on such very light
sterile neutrinos may also be obtained from a re-analysis of atmospheric and
solar neutrino oscillation data, as well as from supernova neutrino
observations. In the second part of the analysis, we compare our sensitivity
with the existing literature using additional assumptions, such as |\Delta
m_{41}^2| \gg |\Delta m_{31}^2| leading to averaging of the fast oscillations
in the far detectors. We demonstrate that while the Neutrino Factory has
excellent sensitivity compared to existing studies using similar assumptions,
one has to be very careful interpreting these results for a combined short and
long baseline setup where oscillations could occur in the near detectors. We
also test the impact of additional \nu_\tau detectors at the short and long

crashes and epileptic seizures is offered. The presented statistical evidence
provides the substance of a general phase diagram for understanding the many
facets of the spatio-temporal organization of these systems. A key insight is
to organize the evidence and mechanisms in terms of two summarizing measures:
(i) amplitude of disorder or heterogeneity in the system and (ii) level of
coupling or interaction strength among the system's components. On the basis of
the recently identified remarkable correspondence between earthquakes and

processes that has been found to be particularly powerful in describing
earthquake phenomenology and which, we think, has a promising future in

parsimoniously the idea that events can trigger other events, and their
cascades of interactions and mutual influence are essential to understand the

High resolution X-ray observations of classical T Tauri stars
(CTTSs) show a soft X-ray excess due to high density plasma (n_e=10^11-10^13
cm^-3). This emission has been attributed to shock-heated accreting material
impacting onto the stellar surface. Aims. We investigate the observability of
the shock-heated accreting material in the X-ray band as a function of the
accretion stream properties (velocity, density, and metal abundance) in the
case of plasma-beta<<1 in the post-shock zone. Methods. We use a 1-D
hydrodynamic model describing the impact of an accretion stream onto the
chromosphere, including the effects of radiative cooling, gravity and thermal
conduction. We explore the space of relevant parameters and synthesize from the
model results the X-ray emission in the [0.5-8.0] keV band and in the resonance
lines of O VII (21.60 Ang) and Ne IX (13.45 Ang), taking into account the
absorption from the chromosphere. Results. The accretion stream properties
influence the temperature and the stand-off height of the shocked slab and its
sinking in the chromosphere, determining the observability of the shocked
plasma. Our model predicts that X-ray observations preferentially detect
emission from low density and high velocity shocked accretion streams due to
the large absorption of dense post-shock plasma. In all the cases examined, the
post-shock zone exhibits quasi-periodic oscillations due to thermal
instabilities, but in the case of inhomogeneous streams and beta<<1, the shock
oscillations are hardly detectable. Conclusions. We suggest that, if accretion
streams are inhomogeneous, the selection effect introduced by the absorption on
observable plasma components may explain the discrepancy between the accretion
rate measured by optical and X-ray data as well as the different densities
measured using different He-like triplets in the X-ray band.

based on the linear Schrodinger equation with time-dependent trapping
potentials, apply to the description of optical planar systems designed for the
switching of trapped light beams. The analysis is carried out in the analytical
form, using exact solutions of the Schrodinger equation. The first dynamical
problem considered in this work is the retention of a particle released from a
trap which was suddenly turned off, while another local trap was switched on at
a distance - immediately or with a delay. In this case, we demonstrate that the
maximum of the retention rate is achieved at a specific finite value of the
strength of the new trap, and at a finite value of the temporal delay,
depending on the distance between the two traps. Another ptoblem is retrapping
of the bound particle when the addition of the second trap transforms the
single-well setting into a double-well potential (DWP). In that case, we find
probabilities for the retrapping into the ground or first excited state of the
DWP. We also analyze effects entailed by the application of a kick to a bound
particle, the most interesting one being a kick-induced transition between the
DWP's ground and excited states. In the latter case, the largest transition
probability is achieved at particular strength of the kick.

A-infinity algebra A extends naturally to a G^+ structure on the pair (C(A),
A). We show that a formality quasi-isomorphism for the Hochschild cochains of
the polynomial algebra can be obtained via transfer of this G^+ structure to
the cohomology of the pair (C(A), A). We show that G^+ is a sub DG operad of

prove that the DG operads G^+ and E^1(SC) are non-formal.

isolated neutron star RX J0720.4-3125 six new XMM-Newton and three Chandra
observations were carried out. The phase coherent timing solutions from
previous authors were performed without restricting to a fixed energy band.
However, we recently showed that the phase residuals are energy dependent, and
thus phase coherent solutions must be computed referring always to the same
energy band. We updated the phase coherent timing solution for RX J0720.4-3125
by including the recent XMM-Newton EPIC-pn, MOS1, MOS2 and Chandra ACIS data in
the energy range 400-1000~eV. Altogether these observations cover a time span
of almost 10~yrs. A further timing solution was obtained including the ROSAT
pointed data. In this case, observations cover a time span of $\approx$16~yrs.
To illustrate the timing differences between the soft band (120-400~eV) and the
hard band (400-1000~eV) a timing solution for the soft band is also presented
and the results are verified using a $\mathrm{Z_{n}^{2}}$ test. In contrast to
previous work, we obtain almost identical solutions whether or not we include
the ROSAT or Chandra data. Thanks to the restriction to the hard band, the data
points from EPIC-pn are in better agreement with those from MOS1, MOS2 and
Chandra than in previous works. In general the phase residuals are still large
and vary with time. In particular, the latest XMM-Newton and Chandra data show
that the phase residuals have attained relatively large and negative values.

observations were obtained via a fortuitous off-axis light path in the 140 --
270 Angstrom passband. The general appearance of the spectra remained
relatively stable over the two-year time period, but did show significant
variations of up to 25% between two sets of Fe lines that show peak emission at
1 MK and 2 MK. The variations occur at a measured period of 27.2 days and are
caused by regions of hotter and cooler plasma rotating into, and out of, the
field of view. The CHIANTI spectral code is employed to determine plasma
temperatures, densities, and emission measures. A set of five isothermal
plasmas fit the full disk spectra well. A 1 -- 2 MK plasma of Fe contributes
85% of the total emission in the CHIPS passband. The standard Differential
Emission Measures (DEMs) supplied with the CHIANTI package do not fit the CHIPS
spectra well as they over-predict emission at temperatures below log(T) = 6.0
and above log(T) = 6.3. The results are important for cross-calibrating TIMED,

observe that the maximum of these upper bounds is 1 e-bit. We conclude that the
reference site can generate a Bell state with a vertex if the corresponding
upper bound of the vertex is 1 e-bit. Thus for generation of a Bell state this
upper bound must be saturated. Taking this into account, we obtain the
characteristic constraint of the proper graphs. We introduce a special class of
antipodal invariant stratification graphs, which is called reflective, whereas
the antipode vertex obeys the characteristic constraint. We also show that the
antipodal association scheme graphs are reflective so Bell states can be
generated between the antipodal vertices. Moreover we observe that in such
graphs the proper Hamiltonian that enables creation of Bell state is the
Heisenberg interaction between vertex pairs.

potential interest in quantum computing or spintronic applications. Unlike
conventional two-dimensional electron states, these surface states are expected
to be immune to localization and to overcome barriers caused by material
imperfection. Previous experiments have demonstrated that topological surface
states do not backscatter between equal and opposite momentum states, owing to
their chiral spin texture. However, so far there is no evidence that these
states in fact transmit through naturally occurring surface defects. Here we
use a scanning tunnelling microscope to measure the transmission and reflection
probabilities of topological surface states of antimony through naturally
occurring crystalline steps separating atomic terraces. In contrast to
nontopological surface states of common metals (copper, silver and gold), which
are either reflected or absorbed by atomic steps, we show that topological
surface states of antimony penetrate such barriers with high probability. This
demonstration of the extended nature of antimony's topological surface states

the presence of atomic scale irregularities-an electronic feature sought to

in many relationships and phenomena. The topic is then divided into the two
main areas of temporal discovery, which is concerned with finding relations

multi-object tracking to ranking of instances. The difficulty of dealing with
these distributions is caused by the size of their domain, which is factorial
in the number of considered entities ($n!$). It makes the direct definition of
a multinomial distribution over permutation space impractical for all but a
very small $n$. In this work we propose an embedding of all $n!$ permutations
for a given $n$ in a surface of a hypersphere defined in
$\mathbbm{R}^{(n-1)^2}$. As a result of the embedding, we acquire ability to
define continuous distributions over a hypersphere with all the benefits of
directional statistics. We provide polynomial time projections between the
continuous hypersphere representation and the $n!$-element permutation space.
The framework provides a way to use continuous directional probability
densities and the methods developed thereof for establishing densities over
permutations. As a demonstration of the benefits of the framework we derive an
inference procedure for a state-space model over permutations. We demonstrate

a longstanding problem. We argue that perhaps this problem does not exist;
namely, there may be no strongly coupled solutions of the massive theory. We
show explicitly that massive type IIA string theory can never be strongly
coupled in a weakly curved region of space-time. We illustrate our general
claim with two classes of massive solutions in AdS4xCP3: one, previously known,
with N = 1 supersymmetry, and a new one with N = 2 supersymmetry. Both
solutions are dual to d = 3 Chern-Simons-matter theories. In both these massive
examples, as the rank N of the gauge group is increased, the dilaton initially
increases in the same way as in the corresponding massless case; before it can
reach the M-theory regime, however, it enters a second regime, in which the
dilaton decreases even as N increases. In the N = 2 case, we find
supersymmetry-preserving gauge-invariant monopole operators whose mass is
independent of N. This predicts the existence of branes which stay light even
when the dilaton decreases. We show that, on the gravity side, these states
originate from D2-D0 bound states wrapping the vanishing two-cycle of a
conifold singularity that develops at large N.

from 36 kpc to 907 kpc, the amplitude of this clustering decreases. At the
largest separations, the CIV systems cluster similar to Lyman-break galaxies
(Adelberger et al. 2005a). The CIV systems are significantly less correlated
than these galaxies, however, at separations less than R_1 ~ 0.42 +/- 0.15 h-1
comoving Mpc. Measured in real space, i.e., transverse to the sightlines, this
length scale is significantly smaller than the break scale estimated from the
line-of-sight correlation function in redshift space (Scannapieco et al.
2006a). Using a simple model, we interpret the new real-space measurement as an
indication of the typical physical size of enriched regions. We adopt this size
for enriched regions and fit the redshift-space distortion in the line-of-sight
correlation function. The fitted velocity kick is consistent with the peculiar
velocity of galaxies as determined by the underlying mass distribution and
places an upper limit on the outflow (or inflow) speed of metals. The implied
time scale for dispersing metals is larger than the typical stellar ages of
Lyman-break galaxies (Shapley et al. 2001), and we argue that enrichment by
galaxies at z > 4.3 played a greater role in dispersing metals. To further
constrain the growth of enriched regions, we discuss empirical constraints on
the evolution of the CIV correlation function with cosmic time. This study
demonstrates the potential of tomography for measuring the metal enrichment

of mesons has been constructed, which integrates the advantages of several QCD
effective Hamiltonian models. Based on light-front QCD effective Hamiltonian
model, the squared invariant mass operator of meson is used as the effective
Hamiltonian. The model has been improved significantly in four major aspects:
i)it is proved that in center of mass frame and in internal coordinate Hilbert
subspace, the total angular momentum $J$ of meson is conserved and the mass
eigen equation can be expressed in total angular momentum representation and in
terms of a set of coupled radial eigen equations for each $J$. ii)Based on
lattice QCD results, a relativistic confining potential is introduced into the
effective interaction and the excited states of mesons can be well described.
iii)an SU(3) flavor mixing interaction is introduced phenomenologically to
describe the flavor mixing mesons and the mass eigen equations contain the
coupling among different flavor components. iv)the mass eigen equations are of
relativistic covariance and the coupled radial mass eigen equations take full
account of $L-S $ coupling and tensor interactions. The model has been applied
to describe the whole meson spectra of about 265 mesons with available data.
The agreement of the calculated masses, squared radii, and decay constants with
data is quite well. For the mesons whose mass data have large experimental
uncertainty, the model produces certain mass values for test. For some mesons
whose total angular momenta and parity are not assigned experimentally, the
model gives a prediction of the spectroscopic configuration$^{2S+1}L_J$. The
connection between our model and the recent low energy QCD issues-the infrared

high-redshift standard candles and standard sirens such as type-Ia supernovae,
gamma-ray bursts, and merging supermassive black hole binaries. There will
therefore be a significant benefit from correcting for the lensing error by
using independent and accurate estimates of the lensing magnification. We
investigate how accurately the magnification can be inferred from convergence
maps reconstructed from galaxy shear and flexion data. We employ ray-tracing
through the Millennium Simulation to simulate lensing observations in large
fields, and perform a weak-lensing reconstruction on these fields. We identify
optimal ways to filter the reconstructed convergence maps and to convert them
to magnification maps. We find that a shear survey with 100 galaxies/arcmin^2
can help to reduce the lensing-induced distance errors for standard
candles/sirens at redshifts z=1.5 (z=5) on average by 20% (10%), whereas a
futuristic survey with shear and flexion estimates from 500 galaxies/arcmin^2
yields much larger reductions of 50% (35%). For redshifts z>=3, a further
improvement by 5% can be achieved, if the individual redshifts of the galaxies
are used in the reconstruction. Moreover, the reconstruction allows one to

two neutrons independently do not form bound systems. Two neutrons should form
a di-neutron cluster in the nuclear field generated by the 9Li core nucleus. We
treat di-neutron clustering by solving the two neutron relative wave function
precisely by using the bare nucleon-nucleon interaction so that the spatial
clustering structure is obtained quantitatively within the whole 11Li nucleus.
This di-neutron clustering is an essential dynamics to form the halo structure
by making a compact di-neutron cluster, which distributes loosely around the
9Li core. The di-neutron clustering is a new concept and is a general
phenomenon in neutron skin and neutron halo nuclei. This quantitative
description of di-neutron clustering has made it necessary to consider another
important deuteron-like tensor correlation, which is caused by strong tensor
interaction in the nucleon-nucleon interaction. The tensor interaction
originates from pion exchange and known to provide large attraction to form the
4He nucleus. The unique feature of the tensor correlation is to make highly
correlated deuteron-like excitation, which interferes with shell model like
structure in a unique way. This dynamical effect removes the magic number
effect and makes easy the participation of the s-wave neutrons. Hence, there
are pairing and deuteron-like tensor correlations in addition to the mean field
structure in 9Li. The combined system of two additional neutrons with the
correlated 9Li provides the halo phenomenon, in which the di-neutron clustering
develops with the help of large s-wave component caused by the deuteron-like
tensor correlation. In this lecture note, we would like to introduce these two
new concepts in a systematic manner and fill a gap between the halo phenomenon
and the microscopic reason for this interesting phenomenon.

edge-disjoint spanning trees crossing each other in a specific way. In this
article, we define a generalization of Schnyder woods to $d$-angulations (plane
graphs with faces of degree $d$) for all $d\geq 3$. A \emph{Schnyder
decomposition} is a set of $d$ spanning forests crossing each other in a
specific way, and such that each internal edge is part of exactly $d-2$ of the
spanning forests. We show that a Schnyder decomposition exists if and only if
the girth of the $d$-angulation is $d$. As in the case of Schnyder woods
($d=3$), there are alternative formulations in terms of orientations
(""fractional"" orientations when $d\geq 5$) and in terms of corner-labellings.
Moreover, the set of Schnyder decompositions on a fixed $d$-angulation of girth
$d$ is a distributive lattice. We also show that the structures dual to
Schnyder decompositions (on $d$-regular plane graphs of mincut $d$ rooted at a
vertex $v^*$) are decompositions into $d$ spanning trees rooted at $v^*$ such
that each edge not incident to $v^*$ is used in opposite directions by two
trees. Additionally, for even values of $d$, we show that a subclass of
Schnyder decompositions, which are called even, enjoy additional properties
that yield a reduced formulation; in the case d=4, these correspond to
well-studied structures on simple quadrangulations (2-orientations and
partitions into 2 spanning trees). In the case d=4, the dual of even Schnyder
decompositions yields (planar) orthogonal and straight-line drawing algorithms.
For a 4-regular plane graph $G$ of mincut 4 with $n$ vertices plus a marked
vertex $v$, the vertices of $G\backslash v$ are placed on a $(n-1) \times
(n-1)$ grid according to a permutation pattern, and in the orthogonal drawing
each of the $2n-2$ edges of $G\backslash v$ has exactly one bend. Embedding
also the marked vertex $v$ is doable at the cost of two additional rows and
columns and 8 additional bends for the 4 edges incident to $v$. We propose a
further compaction step for the drawing algorithm and show that the obtained
grid-size is strongly concentrated around $25n/32\times 25n/32$ for a uniformly
random instance with $n$ vertices.

visual area V1 in the human neocortex that has been designed to account for the
experimentally observed orientation tuning curves by local, i.e.,
cortico-cortical computations. The tuning curves are stationary, i.e. time
independent, solutions of this dynamical model. One important assumption
underlying the Ring Model is that the LGN input to V1 is weakly tuned to the
retinal orientation and that it is the local computations in V1 that sharpen
this tuning. Because the equations that describe the Ring Model have built-in
equivariance properties in the synaptic weight distribution with respect to a
particular group acting on the retinal orientation of the stimulus, the model
in effect encodes an infinite number of tuning curves that are arbitrarily
translated with respect to each other. By using the Orbit Space Reduction
technique we rewrite the model equations in canonical form as functions of
polynomials that are invariant with respect to the action of this group. This
allows us to combine equivariant bifurcation theory with an efficient numerical
continuation method in order to compute the tuning curves predicted by the Ring
Model. Surprisingly some of these tuning curves are not tuned to the stimulus.
We interpret them as neural illusions and show numerically how they can be
induced by simple dynamical stimuli. These neural illusions are important
biological predictions of the model. If they could be observed experimentally
this would be a strong point in favour of the Ring Model. We also show how our
theoretical analysis allows to very simply specify the ranges of the model
parameters by comparing the model predictions with published experimental
observations.

between their canonical conjugate momenta. The investigation is carried out by
means of comparative analysis of mathematical properties of time evolution of
variables in classical model and wave function of universe in quantum level. We
find that impose of noncommutativity causes more ability in tuning time
solutions of scalar fields and hence, has important implications in evolution
of universe. We get that noncommutative parameter in momenta sector is the only
responsible parameter for noncommutative effects in flat universes. A
distinguishing feature of noncommutative solutions of scalar fields is that
they can be simulated with well known harmonic oscillators, depend on values of
spatial curvature. Namely free, forced and damped harmonic oscillators
corresponding to flat, closed and open universes. In this respect, we call them
cosmical oscillators. In closed universes, when noncommutative parameters are
small, cosmical oscillators have analogous effect with familiar beating effect
in sound phenomenon. The existence of non-zero constant potential does not
change solutions of scalar fields, but modifies scale factor. An interesting
feature of well behaved solutions of wave functions is that functional form of
its radial part is the same as commutative ones provided that given replacement
of constants, caused by noncommutative parameters, is performed. Further,
Noether theorem has been employed to explore effects of noncommutativity on
underlying symmetries in commutative frame. Two of six Noether symmetries of

indications of broken time-reversal symmetry in photoemission experiments,
recent polarized neutron diffraction work demonstrated the universal existence
of an unusual magnetic order below T*. These findings have the profound
implication that the pseudogap regime constitutes a genuine new phase of matter
rather than a mere crossover phenomenon. They are furthermore consistent with a
particular type of order involving circulating orbital currents, and with the
notion that the phase diagram is controlled by a quantum critical point. Here
we report inelastic neutron scattering results for HgBa2CuO4+x (Hg1201) that
reveal a fundamental collective magnetic mode associated with the unusual
order, and that further support this picture. The mode's intensity rises below
the same temperature T* and its dispersion is weak, as expected for an
Ising-like order parameter. Its energy of 52-56 meV and its enormous integrated
spectral weight render it a new candidate for the hitherto unexplained

0.5\% of continuum intensity to these synthetic profiles and invert them again

we determine the uncertainty in the magnetic non-potentiality of a sunspot as
determined by the force-free parameter alpha_g and Spatially Averaged Signed

parameters are alpha_g = -3.5 +/- 0.37 (x 10^{-9} m^{-1}) and SASSA = -1.68 +/-

techniques to evaluate the variational ground-state energy, improved local as

dynamical impurity approximation (DIA), the ferromagnetic phase diagram of the

previous dynamical mean-field studies for benchmarking purposes. The DIA
results provide a unified picture of ferromagnetism in the infinite-dimensional

different mechanisms for ferromagnetic order. Using the DIA and the VCA, we
then study ferromagnetism in one-dimensional Hubbard chains with nearest and
next-nearest-neighbor hopping t2. In comparison with previous results from the
density-matrix renormalization group, the phase diagram is mapped out as a

galaxies with little or no optical emission lines, harbour significant amounts
of dust-obscured star formation. We propose that these observational results
can be explained if the spatial distributions of the cold gas and star-forming
regions in these spiral galaxies are significantly more compact than those in
blue star-forming spirals. Our numerical simulations show that if the sizes of
star-forming regions in spiral galaxies with disk sizes of R_d are ~ 0.3R_d,
such galaxies appear to have lower star formation rates as well as higher
degrees of dust extinction. This is mainly because star formation in these
spirals occurs only in the inner regions where both the gas densities and
metallicities are higher, and hence the dust extinction is also significantly
higher. We discuss whether star formation occurring preferentially in the inner
regions of spirals is closely associated with the stripping of halo and disk
gas via some sort of environmental effect. We suggest that the ""outside-in
truncation of star formation"" is the key to a better understanding of
apparently optically--passive spirals with dusty star-forming regions.

threshold mass, M ~ 3.5Msun for Z=0.001, the results are little dependent on
the opacity treatment, as long as hot-bottom burning prevents the surface C/O
ratio from exceeding unity; the yields of these massive AGB stars are expected
to be mostly determined by the efficiency of convection, with a relatively mild
dependence on the mass-loss description. A much higher degree of uncertainty is
associated to the yields of less massive models, which critically depend on the
adopted molecular opacities. An interval of masses exists, say 2.0-3.0Msun,
(the exact range depends on mass loss), in which HBB may be even extinguished
following the cooling produced by the opacity of C-bearing molecules. The
yields of these stars are the most uncertain, the variation range being the
largest (up to ~ 2dex) for the nitrogen and sodium yields. For very low-mass
models, not experiencing hot-bottom burning (M< 1.5Msun),the description of
mass loss and the treatment of the convective boundaries are crucial for the
occurrence of the third dredge-up, with sizable consequences on the CNO yields.

the assumption that the observed rotation produces a centripetal force that
exactly balances the inward force of gravity. However, most rotation curves are
measured using emission lines from gas, which can experience additional forces
due to pressure. In realistic galaxy disks, the gas pressure declines with
radius, providing additional radial support to the disk. The measured
tangential rotation speed will therefore tend to lag the true circular velocity
of a test particle. The gas pressure is dominated by turbulence, and we
evaluate its likely amplitude from recent estimates of the gas velocity
dispersion and surface density. We show that where the amplitude of the
rotation curve is comparable to the characteristic velocities of the
interstellar turbulence, pressure support may lead to underestimates of the
mass density of the underlying dark matter halo and the inner slope of its
density profile. These effects may be significant for galaxies with rotation
speeds <75km/s, but are unlikely to be significant in higher mass galaxies. We
find that pressure support can be sustained over long timescales, because any
reduction in support due to the conversion of gas into stars is compensated for
by an inward flow of gas. However, we point to many uncertainties in assessing
the importance of pressure support in galaxies. Thus, while pressure support
may alleviate possible tensions between rotation curve observations and
LambdaCDM on kiloparsec scales, it should not be viewed as a definitive
solution at this time.

moons' tidal orbital evolution. Moons are eventually ejected from around

they are unlikely to have been formed in situ, instead they were captured from
the protoplanetary disk on retrograde orbits around the planets.

planets within our own Solar system, describing the three populations of

Asteroids and the Long-Period Comets) are well understood, with members
originating in the Asteroid belt and Oort cloud, respectively. By contrast, the
source of the third population, the Short-Period Comets, is still under debate.
The proximate source of these objects is the Centaurs, a population of
dynamically unstable objects that pass perihelion between the orbits of Jupiter
and Neptune. However, a variety of different origins have been suggested for
the Centaur population. Here, we present evidence that at least a significant
fraction of the Centaur population can be sourced from the planetary Trojan
clouds, stable reservoirs of objects moving in 1:1 mean-motion resonance with
the giant planets (primarily Jupiter and Neptune). Focusing on simulations of
the Neptunian Trojan population, we show that an ongoing flux of objects should
be leaving that region to move on orbits within the Centaur population. With
conservative estimates of the flux from the Neptunian Trojan clouds, we show
that their contribution to that population could be of order ~3%, while more
realistic estimates suggest that the Neptune Trojans could even be the main
source of fresh Centaurs. We suggest that further observational work is needed
to constrain the contribution made by the Neptune Trojans to the ongoing flux
of material to the inner Solar system, and believe that future studies of the
habitability of exoplanetary systems should take care not to neglect the
contribution of resonant objects (such as planetary Trojans) to the impact flux
that could be experienced by potentially habitable worlds.

separates the regions where either the single-boson or the boson-pair

nitrogen. We report observations of absorption in NH N=1-0, J=2-1 and ortho-NH2
1_1,1-0_0,0. We also observed ortho-NH3 1_0-0_0, and 2_0-1_0, para-NH3 2_1-1_1,
and searched unsuccessfully for NH+. All detections show emission and
absorption associated directly with the hot-core source itself as well as
absorption by foreground material over a wide range of velocities. All spectra
show similar, non-saturated, absorption features, which we attribute to diffuse
molecular gas. Total column densities over the velocity range 11-54 km/s are
estimated. The similar profiles suggest fairly uniform abundances relative to
hydrogen, approximately 6*10^-9, 3*10^-9, and 3*10^-9 for NH, NH2, and NH3,
respectively. These abundances are discussed with reference to models of
gas-phase and surface chemistry.

we study the effects of kinematic cuts on the extracted branching ratios.
Analytical formulae are given at all stages of the calculation. We find that
the t-> q gamma decay can be used to probe also the effective operators
mediating t-> q g processes, since these can naturally contribute 10% or more
to the radiative decay, given typical experimental cuts on the decay kinematics

available VLBI observations of supernova SN1993J, following an homogeneous and
well-defined methodology. Observations of SN1993J at 69 epochs, spanning 13
years, were performed by two teams, which used different strategies and
analysis tools. The results obtained by each group are similar, but their
conclusions on the supernova expansion and the shape and evolution of the
emitting region differ significantly. From our analysis of the combined set of
observations, we have obtained an expansion curve with unprecedented time
resolution and coverage. We find that the data from both teams are compatible
when analyzed with the same methodology. One expansion index ($m_3 = 0.87 \pm
0.02$) is enough to model the expansion observed at 1.7\,GHz, while two
expansion indices ($m_1 = 0.933\pm0.010$ and $m_2 = 0.796\pm0.005$), separated
by a break time, $t_{br} = 390\pm30$ days, are needed to model the data, at
frequencies higher than 1.7\,GHz, up to day 4000 after explosion. We thus
confirm the wavelength dependence of the size of the emitting region reported
by one of the groups. We also find that all sizes measured at epochs later than
day 4000 after explosion are systematically smaller than our model predictions.
We estimate the fractional shell width ($0.31 \pm 0.02$, average of all epochs
and frequencies) and the level of opacity to the radio emission by the ejecta.
We find evidence of a spectral-index radial gradient in the supernova shell,
which is indicative of a frequency-dependent ejecta opacity. Finally, we study
the distribution and evolution of the azimuthal anisotropies (hot spots) found
around the radio shell during the expansion. These anisotropies have
intensities of $\sim 20$% of the mean flux density of the shell, and appear to
systematically evolve during the expansion.

this infrared property of the quantum spacetime is nontrivial and due to

makes the appearance of the de Sitter universe an example of true emergence of
classicality from microscopic quantum laws. We also discuss nontrivial aspects

so-called Q-drop, at high accelerating electric fields is presented. Breakdown
of the surface barrier against magnetic flux penetration at the cavity equator
is considered to be the critical event that determines the onset of Q-drop. The
worst case of triangular grooves with low field of first flux penetration Hp,
as analyzed previously by Buzdin and Daumens, [1998 Physica C 294: 257], was
adapted. This approach incorporates both the geometry of the groove and local
contamination via the Ginzburg-Landau parameter kappa, so the proposed model
allows new comparisons of one effect in relation to the other. The model
predicts equivalent reduction of Hp when either roughness or contamination were
varied alone, so smooth but dirty surfaces limit cavity performance about as
much as rough but clean surfaces do. When in combination, contamination
exacerbates the negative effects of roughness and vice-versa. To test the model
with actual data, coupons were prepared by buffered chemical polishing and
electropolishing, and stylus profilometry was used to obtain distributions of
angles. From these data, curves for surface resistance generated by simple flux
flow as a function of magnetic field were generated by integrating over the
distribution of angles for reasonable values of kappa. This showed that
combined effects of roughness and contamination indeed reduce the Q-drop onset
field by ~30%, and that that contamination contributes to Q-drop as much as
roughness. The latter point may be overlooked by SRF cavity research, since
access to the cavity interior by spectroscopy tools is very difficult, whereas
optical images have become commonplace. The model was extended to fit cavity
test data, which indicated that reduction of the superconducting gap by
contaminants may also play a role in Q-drop.

Jeans scale length, and is mainly regulated by gravitational instabilities.
From this scale of energy injection, a turbulence cascade towards small-scale
is observed, with almost isotropic small-scale motions. On scales larger than
the disk thickness, density waves are observed, but there is also a full range
of substructures with chaotic and strongly non-isotropic gas velocity
dispersions. The power spectrum of vorticity in an LMC-sized model suggests
that an inverse cascade of turbulence might be present, although energy input
over a wide range of scales in the coupled gaseous+stellar fluid could also
explain this quasi-2D regime on scales larger than the disk scale height.
Similar regimes of gas turbulence are also found in massive high-redshift disks
with high gas fractions. Disk properties and ISM turbulence appear to be mainly
regulated by gravitational processes, both on large scales and inside dense
clouds. Star formation feedback is however essential to maintain the ISM in a
steady state by balancing a systematic gas dissipation into dense and small
clumps. Our galaxy simulations employ a thermal model based on a barotropic
Equation of State (EoS) aimed at modelling the equilibrium of gas between
various heating and cooling processes. Denser gas is typically colder in this
approach, which is shown to correctly reproduce the density structures of a
star-forming, turbulent, unstable and cloudy ISM down to scales of a few

solutions are presented. The mass-accretion rate $\dot{M}$ decreases with
radius $r$ as $\dot{M}\propto r^{s+1/2}$, where $s$ is an arbitrary constant.
We show that existence of wind will lead to enhance the accretion velocity.
Cooling effects of outflows or winds are noticeable and should be taken into
account for calculating luminosity and effective temperature of optically thin
and thick ADAFs. Increasing the effect of wind, decreases the disk's
temperature, because of energy flux which is taken away by winds. We will see
that for a given set of input parameters, the solution reaches to a
non-rotating limit at a specific value of $\phi_s$. The values of this
limitation on $\phi_s$ will increase by adding $s$, wind parameter. In fact,
the higher values of $s$ will allow the disk to have physical rotating solution

feasibility of local operator control in arrays of interacting qubits modeled
as isotropic Heisenberg spin chains. Acting on one of the end spins, we aim at
finding piecewise-constant control pulses that lead to optimal fidelities for a
chosen set of quantum gates. We analyze the robustness of the obtained results
f or the gate fidelities to random errors in the control fields, finding that
with faster switching between piecewise-constant controls the system is less
susceptible to these errors. The observed behavior falls into a generic class
of physical phenomena that are related to a competition between resonance- and
relaxation-type behavior, exemplified by motional narrowing in NMR experiments.
Finally, we discuss how the obtained optimal gate fidelities are altered when
the corresponding rapidly-varying piecewise-constant control fields are
smoothened through spectral filtering.

stronger scattering and hence have a lower mobility than the electrons. We

next-to-leading order for both symmetric nuclear matter and neutron matter. Our
calculation includes the full in-medium iteration of the leading order local
and one-pion exchange nucleon-nucleon interactions. Interestingly, we find a
cancellation between the contributions stemming from the quark mass dependence
of the nucleon mass appearing in the in-medium nucleon-nucleon interactions.
Only the contributions originating from the explicit quark mass dependence of
the pion mass survive. This cancellation is the reason of previous observations
concerning the dominant role of the long-range pion contributions and the
suppression of short-range nucleon-nucleon interactions. We find that the
linear density contribution to the in-medium chiral quark condensate is only
slightly modified for pure neutron matter by the nucleon-nucleon interactions.
For symmetric nuclear matter the in-medium corrections are larger, although
smaller compared to other approaches due to the full iteration of the lowest
order nucleon-nucleon tree-level amplitudes. Our calculation satisfies the
Hellmann-Feynman theorem to the order worked out. Also we address the problem
of calculating the leading in-medium corrections to the pion decay constant. We
find that there are no extra in-medium corrections that violate the

processes, including cell migration, proliferation, and apoptosis. Ligand
binding activates integrins by stabilizing an integrin conformation with
separated cytoplasmic tails, thus enabling the binding of proteins that mediate
cytoplasmic signaling. Experiments demonstrate a high sensitivity of integrin
signaling to ligand density and this has been accounted mainly to avidity
effects. Based on experimental data we have developed a quantitative Monte
Carlo model for integrin signal initiation. We show that within the
physiological ligand density range avidity effects cannot explain the
sensitivity of cellular signaling to small changes in ligand density. Src
kinases are among the first proteins to be activated, possibly by trans
auto-phosphorylation. We calculate the extent of integrin and ligand clustering
as well as the speed and extent of Src kinase activation by trans
auto-phosphorylation or direct binding at different experimentally monitored
ligand densities. We find that the experimentally observed ligand density
dependency can be reproduced if Src kinases are activated by trans
auto-phosphorylation or some other mechanism limits integrin-dependent Src
kinase activation. We propose that Src kinase and thus cell activation by trans
auto-phosphorylation may provide a mechanism to enable ligand-density dependent
responses at physiological ligand densities. The capacity to detect small
differences in ligand density at a ligand density that is large enough to
permit cell adhesion is likely to be important for haptotaxis.

We computed the spectral slopes in several wavelength ranges for each observed

mainly of the 0.9 micron band tentatively attributed to orthopyroxene, and of

clusters are used to analyze the doping-driven metal-insulator transition in
the two dimensional Hubbard model. Comparison of results obtained on different
clusters enables a determination of those aspects of the physics that are
common to all clusters and permits identification of artifacts associated with
particular cluster geometries. A modest particle-hole asymmetry in the
underlying band structure is shown to lead to qualitatively different behavior
on the hole doped side than on the electron doped side. For particle-hole
asymmetry of the sign and magnitude appropriate to high-$T_c$ cuprates, the
approach to the insulator from the hole-doping side is found to proceed in two
stages from a high-doping region where the properties are those of a Fermi
liquid with moderately renormalized parameters and very weak momentum
dependence. As doping is reduced the system first enters an intermediate doping
regime where the Fermi liquid renormalizations are larger and the electron self
energy varies significantly around the Fermi surface and then passes to a small
doping regime characterized by a gap in some regions of the Fermi surface but
gapless behavior in other regions. On the electron doped side the partially
gapped regime does not occur, and the momentum dependence of the electron self
energy is less pronounced. Implications for the high-$T_c$ cuprates and for the
use of cluster dynamical mean field methods in wider classes of problems are
discussed.

the inflaton that is proportional to the Hubble parameter. This force affects
the slow-roll dynamics, but still allows for a natural end to inflation.

different protocols to produce the jammed state. In agreement with other works,
we find that cooling and compression can lead to a broad range of jamming
packing fractions $\phi_J$, depending on cooling rate and initial
configuration; the larger the degree of big particle clustering in the initial
configuration, the larger will be the value of $\phi_J$. In contrast, we find
that shearing disrupts particle clustering, leading to a much narrower range of
$\phi_J$ as the shear strain rate varies. In the limit of vanishingly small
shear strain rate, we find a unique non-trivial value for the jamming density
that is independent of the initial system configuration. We conclude that shear
driven jamming is a unique and well defined critical point in the space of
shear driven steady states. We clarify the relation between glassy behavior,
rigidity and jamming in such systems and relate our results to recent
experiments.

classification results for complete surfaces with empty singular set which are

show that such a surface is a vertical plane. In the sub-Riemannian hyperbolic

The technique is based on the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference between a
single photon state and a suitably prepared coherent field. We show that the
temporal width of the HOM dip is not only related to reciprocal of the spectral
width but also to the underlying quantum coherence. Therefore, by measuring the
width of both the HOM dip and the spectrum one can directly quantify the degree
of spectral purity. The distinct advantage of our proposal is that it obviates
the need for perfect mode matching, since it does not rely on the visibility of
the interference. Our method is particularly useful for characterizing the
purity of heralded single photon states.

persist also at finite temperatures (up to the critical temperature $\tau_c$)
and that the phase transition at the critical point is of the first order for
the chessboard and axial striped phase and of the second order for the

reduced with the increasing amplitude of correlated hopping $t'$ in the

decays of resonances can be generally described by the square of some types of
the associated Legendre functions. It is combined with the selection rule, then
the agreements are very good. The decay formulas of the similar decay modes are
the same. For the same types of particles, the coupling constants are kept to
be invariant, and only six constants are independent. The simplest dynamical
basis is probably that the decay formulas are the square of the solution of
free field equation of the decay particles in the momentum coordinate system.
Further, we discuss some general decays and their rules. Finally, we apply the
decay formulas to some massive hadrons.
