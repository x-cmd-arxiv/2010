dimensions at finite temperatures by using the t-J model, a canonical model of
strongly-correlated electrons. We employ the slave-fermion representation of
electrons in which an electron is described as a composite of a charged
spinless holon and a chargeless spinon. We introduce two kinds of U(1) gauge
fields on links as auxiliary fields, one describing resonating valence bonds of
antiferromagnetic nearest-neighbor spin pairs and the other for
nearest-neighbor hopping amplitudes of holons and spinons in the ferromagnetic
channel. In order to perform numerical study of the system, we integrate out
the fermionic holon field by using the hopping expansion in powers of the
hopping amplitude, which is legitimate for the region in and near the
insulating phase. The resultant effective model is described in terms of
bosonic spinons and the two U(1) gauge fields, and a collective field for hole
pairs. We study this model by means of Monte-Carlo simulations, calculating the
specific heat, spin correlation functions, and instanton densities. We obtain a
phase diagram in the hole concentration-temperature plane, which is in good
agreement with that observed recently for clean and homogeneous underdoped
samples.

Our idea is to use confidence limits to define stopping and decision rules. The

monotonicity of the associated operating characteristic function. We show that

JKTEBOP code with a genetic algorithm to obtain precise values for each system.
We identify 95 new systems with both components below 1.0 M_sun and eclipses of
at least 0.1 magnitudes, suitable for ground-based follow-up. Of these, 14 have
periods less than 1.0 day, 52 have periods between 1.0 and 10.0 days, and 29
have periods greater than 10.0 days. This new sample of main-sequence,
low-mass, double-eclipse, detached eclipsing binary candidates more than
doubles the number of previously known systems, and extends the sample into the
completely heretofore unexplored P > 10.0 day period regime. We find
preliminary evidence from these systems that the radii of low-mass stars in
binary systems decrease with period. This supports the theory that binary
spin-up is the primary cause of inflated radii in low-mass binary systems,
although a full analysis of each system with radial-velocity and multi-color
light curves is needed to fully explore this hypothesis. As well, we present 7
new transiting planet candidates that do not appear among the recently released
list of 706 candidates by the Kepler team, nor in the Kepler False Positive
Catalog, along with several other new and interesting systems. We also present
novel techniques for the identification, period analysis, and modeling of

(IHBs) or a common heat bath (CHB). We understand the quantum thermalization in
eigenstate and bare-state representations when the coupling between the two
TLSs is stronger and weaker than the TLS-bath couplings, respectively. In the
IHB case, we find that when the two IHBs have the same temperatures, the two
coupled TLSs in eigenstate representation can be thermalized with the same
temperature as those of the IHBs. However, in the case of two IHBs at different
temperatures, just when the energy detuning between the two TLSs satisfies a
special condition, the two coupled TLSs in eigenstate representation can be
thermalized with an immediate temperature between those of the two IHBs. In
bare-state representation, we find a counterintuitive phenomenon that, under
some conditions, the temperature of the TLS connected with the high-temperature
bath is lower than that of the other TLS, which is connected with the
low-temperature bath. In the CHB case, the coupled TLSs in eigenstate
representation can be thermalized with the same temperature as that of the CHB
in nonresonant cases. In bare-state representation, the TLS with a larger
energy separation can be thermalized to a thermal equilibrium with a lower
temperature. In the resonant case, we find a phenomenon of anti-thermalization.
We also study the steady-state entanglement between the two TLSs in both the
IHB and CHB cases.

equilibrium distribution functions of stellar systems. The method is a
generalization of Schwarzschild's orbit superposition method from the space of
discrete functions to continuous ones. In contrast to Schwarzschild's method,
FEM produces a continuous distribution function (DF) and satisfies the intra
element continuity and Jeans equations. The method employs two finite-element
meshes, one in configuration space and one in action space. The DF is
represented by its values at the nodes of the action-space mesh and by
interpolating functions inside the elements. The Galerkin projection of all
equations that involve the DF leads to a linear system of equations, which can
be solved for the nodal values of the DF using linear or quadratic programming,
or other optimization methods. We illustrate the superior performance of FEM by
constructing ergodic and anisotropic equilibrium DFs for spherical stellar
systems (Hernquist models). We also show that explicitly constraining the DF by
the Jeans equations leads to smoother and/or more accurate solutions with both

not provide fair resource reciprocation and may allow free-riding. In this
paper, we propose a BitTorrent-like protocol that replaces the peer selection
mechanisms in the regular BitTorrent protocol with a novel reinforcement
learning (RL) based mechanism. Due to the inherent opration of P2P systems,
which involves repeated interactions among peers over a long period of time,
the peers can efficiently identify free-riders as well as desirable
collaborators by learning the behavior of their associated peers. Thus, it can
help peers improve their download rates and discourage free-riding, while
improving fairness in the system. We model the peers' interactions in the
BitTorrent-like network as a repeated interaction game, where we explicitly
consider the strategic behavior of the peers. A peer, which applies the
RL-based mechanism, uses a partial history of the observations on associated
peers' statistical reciprocal behaviors to determine its best responses and
estimate the corresponding impact on its expected utility. The policy
determines the peer's resource reciprocations with other peers, which would
maximize the peer's long-term performance, thereby making foresighted
decisions. We have implemented the proposed reinforcement-learning based
mechanism and incorporated it into an existing BitTorrent client. We have
performed extensive experiments on a controlled Planetlab test bed. Our results
confirm that our proposed protocol (1) promotes fairness in terms of incentives
to each peer's contribution e.g. high capacity peers improve their download
completion time by up to 33\%, (2) improves the system stability and robustness
e.g. reducing the peer selection luctuations by 57\%, and (3) discourages
free-riding e.g. peers reduce by 64\% their upload to \FR, in comparison to the
regular \BT~protocol.

The refrigerator functions in two steps: thermally isolated interaction between

the cold bath and the efficiency: the latter nullifies when the former is

optimizing the product of the heat-power and efficiency over the Hamiltonian of

universe is considered. We assume that the universe starts from completely
symmetric state and then, as it cools down, it undergoes a quantum-phase
transition which in turn causes an asymmetry between matter and anti-matter.
The mechanism does not require the baryon number violating interactions or CP
violation at a microscopic level. Our analysis of the matter-antimatter
asymmetry is in the context of conspicuous experimental results obtained in the
condensed-matter physics.

analytic asymptotically cylindrical ends initiated in~arXiv:1003.2538. By using
the complex scaling method and the Phragm\'{e}n-Lindel\""{o}f principle we prove
exponential decay of the eigenfunctions corresponding to the non-threshold
eigenvalues of the Laplacian on functions. In the case of a manifold with
(non-compact) boundary it is either the Dirichlet Laplacian or the Neumann
Laplacian. We show that the rate of exponential decay of an eigenfunction is
prescribed by the distance from the corresponding eigenvalue to the next
threshold. Under our assumptions on the behaviour of the metric at infinity
accumulation of isolated and embedded eigenvalues occur. The results on decay
of eigenfunctions combined with the compactness argument due to Perry imply
that the eigenvalues can accumulate only at thresholds and only from below. The
eigenvalues are of finite multiplicity.

rotating K0 dwarf AB Doradus using a global MHD model. The model is driven by a
surface map of the radial magnetic field constructed using Zeeman-Doppler
Imaging. We find that the global structure of the stellar corona is dominated
by strong azimuthal tangling of the magnetic field due to the rapid rotation.
The MHD solution enables us to calculate realistic Alfv\'en surfaces and we can
therefore estimate the stellar mass loss rate and angular momentum loss rate
without making undue theoretical simplifications. We consider three cases,
parametrized by the base density of the corona, that span the range of possible
solutions for the system. We find that overall, the mass and angular-momentum
loss rates are higher than in the solar case; the mass loss rates are 10 to 500
times higher, and the angular momentum loss rate can be up to $3\times{10}^4$
higher than present day solar values. Our simulations show that this model can
be use to constrain the wide parameter space of stellar systems. It also shows
that an MHD approach can provide more information about the physical system
over the commonly used potential field extrapolation.

less time consuming to find documents from a large collection when the
collection is ordered or classified by group or category. The problem of
finding best such grouping is still there. This paper discusses the
implementation of k-Means clustering algorithm for clustering unstructured text

The family of approximated correlation functions is determined in such a way,

$\mathbb{R}^d$ which for a given partition of the configuration space
$\mathbb{R}^d$ into nonintersecting hyper cubes with a volume $a^d$ contain no

interaction potentials and for many-body case.
