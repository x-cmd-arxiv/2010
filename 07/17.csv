diffusion equations with negative square root -type reaction terms. In
particular we investigate the exponential behavior of the solutions after a
standard hyperbolic scaling. This leads to a Hamilton-Jacobi variational
inequality with an obstacle that depends on the solution itself and defines the
open set where the limiting solution does not vanish. Counter-examples show a
nontrivial lack of uniqueness for the variational inequality depending on the
conditions imposed on the boundary of this open set. Both Dirichlet and state
constraints boundary conditions play a role. When the competition term does not
change sign, we can identify the limit, while, in general, we find lower and
upper bounds for the limit. Although models of this type are rather old and
extinction phenomena are as important as blow-up, our motivation comes from the
so-called ""tail problem"" in population biology. One way to avoid meaningless
exponential tails, is to impose extra-mortality below a given survival
threshold. Our study shows that the precise form of this extra-mortality term
is asymptotically irrelevant and that, in the survival zone, the population
profile is impacted by the survival threshold (except in the very particular
case when the competition term is non-positive).

are able carry out a more in-depth study providing solid evidences of the

the fundamental F-mode. Hence for any choice of the polytropic constant, the
critical solution will distinguish the set of subcritical models migrating to
the stable branch of the models of equilibrium from the set of subcritical

spatial scales in the blast. The pre-explosion system conditions included the
secondary star and a flared accretion disk. These conditions can have a
profound influence on the evolving blast wave. The blast itself is shadowed by
the secondary star, which itself gives rise to a low-temperature bow-shock. The
accretion disk is completely destroyed in the explosion. A model with a disk
gas density of 10^{15} cm^{-3} produced a blast wave that is collimated and
with clear bipolar structures, including a bipolar X-ray emitting shell. The
degree of collimation depends on the initial mass of ejecta, energy of
explosion, and circumstellar gas density distribution. It is most pronounced
for a model with the lowest explosion energy (10^{43} erg) and mass of ejecta
(10^{-8} M_{\odot}). The X-ray luminosities of three of six models computed are
close to, but consistent with, an upper limit to the early blast X-ray emission
obtained by the Swift satellite, the X-ray luminosity being larger for higher
circumstellar gas density and higher ejecta mass. The latter consideration,
together with estimates of the blast energy from previous outbursts, suggests
that the mass of ejecta in the 2010 outburst was not larger than 10^{-7}

Algebra 368 (2012), 40-52",,,"math.RT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is well-known that any maximal Cohen-Macaulay module over a hypersurface
has a periodic free resolution of period 2. Auslander, Reiten and Buchweitz
have used this periodicity to explain the existence of periodic projective
resolutions over certain finite-dimensional algebras which arise as stable
endomorphism rings of Cohen-Macaulay modules. These algebras are in fact
periodic, meaning that they have periodic projective resolutions as bimodules
and thus periodic Hochschild cohomology as well. The goal of this article is to
generalize this construction of periodic algebras to the context of Iyama's
higher AR-theory. We start by considering projective resolutions of functors on
a maximal (d-1)-orthogonal subcategory C of an exact Frobenius category B. If C
is fixed by the d-th syzygy functor of B, then we show that this d-th syzygy
functor induces the (2+d)-th syzygy on the category of finitely presented
functors on the stable category of C. If C has finite type, i.e., if C = add(T)
for a d-cluster tilting object T, then we show that the stable endomorphism
ring of T has a quasi-periodic resolution over its enveloping algebra.
Moreover, this resolution will be periodic if some higher syzygy functor is
isomorphic to the identity on the stable category of C. It follows, in
particular, that 2-C.Y. tilted algebras arising as stable endomorphism rings of
Cohen-Macaulay modules over curve singularities, as in the work of Burban,
Iyama, Keller and Reiten have periodic bimodule resolutions of period 4.

reactions from 40 to 158 AGeV and comparing the PHSD results to those of the
Hadron-String Dynamics (HSD) approach without a phase transition to the QGP, we
observe that the existence of the partonic phase has a sizable influence on the
transverse mass distribution of final kaons due to the repulsive partonic mean
fields. Furthermore, we find a significant effect of the QGP on the production
of multi-strange antibaryons due to a slightly enhanced ssbar pair production
in the partonic phase from massive time-like gluon decay and to a more abundant
formation of strange antibaryons in the hadronization process. Another evidence
for pre-hadronization dynamics is gained from a study of di-jet correlations in
Au+Au collisions at the top RHIC energy of sqrt(S)=200 GeV. Within the HSD
transport approach, the reaction of the hadronic medium to the jet energy loss
is calculated. In comparison with the data of the STAR, PHOBOS and PHENIX
Collaborations differentially in azimuthal angle and pseudorapidity, the HSD
results do not show enough suppression for the `away-side' jet. In addition,
the HSD results exhibit neither a `Mach-cone' structure for the angular
distribution in the away-side jet nor the `ridge' long-range rapidity
correlations for the near-side jet as observed by the STAR and PHOBOS
Collaborations, thus suggesting a partonic origin of these structures.

important to characterize the impact of interference in the performance of a

presents a unifying framework for characterizing the local throughput in
wireless networks. We first analyze the throughput of a probe link from a
connectivity perspective, in which a packet is successfully received if it does
not collide with other packets from nodes within its reach (called the audible
interferers). We then characterize the throughput from a
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) perspective, in which a packet
is successfully received if the SINR exceeds some threshold, considering the
interference from all emitting nodes in the network. Our main contribution is
to generalize and unify various results scattered throughout the literature. In
particular, the proposed framework encompasses arbitrary wireless propagation
effects (e.g, Nakagami-m fading, Rician fading, or log-normal shadowing), as
well as arbitrary traffic patterns (e.g., slotted-synchronous,
slotted-asynchronous, or exponential-interarrivals traffic), allowing us to
draw more general conclusions about network performance than previously

quiescent state since its last outburst in 1979. Typically, quiescent emission
from these objects consists of thermal emission (presumably from the neutron
star surface) with an additional hard power-law tail of unknown nature.
Variability has been observed during quiescence in Cen X-4 on both timescales
as short as hundreds of seconds and as long as years. However, the nature of
this variability is still unknown. Early observations seemed to show it was all
due to a variable hard X-ray tail. Here, we present new and archival
observations that contradict this. The most recent Suzaku observation of Cen
X-4 finds it in a historically low state, a factor of 4.4 fainter than the
brightest quiescent observation. As the spectrum during the brightest
observation was comprised of approximately 60% from the thermal component and
40% from the power-law component, such a large change cannot be explained by
just power-law variability. Spectral fits with a variable thermal component fit
the data well, while spectral fits allowing both the column density and the
power-law to vary do not, leading to the conclusion that the thermal component
must be variable. Interestingly, we also find that the thermal fraction remains
consistent between all epochs, implying that the thermal and power-law fluxes
vary by approximately the same amount. If the emitting area remains unchanged
between observations, then the effective surface temperature must change.
Alternatively, if the temperature remains constant, then the emitting area must
change. The nature of this thermal variability is unclear, but may be explained
by variable low-level accretion.

system 1A 1118-615, during an outburst stage in January, 2009 and at a flaring
stage in March, 2009. Using the epoch-folding method, we successfully detected
a pulsed period of 407.69(2) sec in the outburst of January and of 407.26(1)
sec after the flare detection in March. We find that the spectral detection for
the source during outburst can be described by a blackbody model with a high
temperature (kT ~ 1-3 keV) and a small radius (R ~ 1 km), indicating that the
emission results from the polar cap of the neutron star. On the other hand, the
spectra obtained after the outburst can further be described by adding an
additional component with a lower temperature (kT ~ 0.1-0.2 keV) and a larger
emission radius (R ~ 10-500 km), which indicates the emission from around the
inner region of an accretion disk. We find that the thermal emission from the
hot spot of the accreting neutron star dominates the radiation in outburst; the
existence of both this X-ray contribution and the additional soft component
suggest that the polar cap and the accretion disk emission might co-exist after
the outburst. Because the two-blackbody signature at the flaring stage is a
unique feature of 1A 1118-615, our spectral results may provide a new insight
to interpret the X-ray emission for the accreting neutron star. The time
separation between the three main outbursts of this system is ~17 years and it
might be related to the orbital period. We derive and discuss the associated
physical properties by assuming the elongated orbit for this specific Be/X-ray

when the optical flux of EX Lup remained about 4 times above its pre-outburst

keV by emission from a relatively cool plasma (~4.7 MK) that is lightly
absorbed (NH~3.6E20 cm^-2) and above ~1.5 keV by emission from a plasma that is
~ten times hotter and affected by a photoelectric absorption that is 75 times
larger. During the X-ray flare, the emission measure and the intrinsic X-ray
luminosity of this absorbed plasma component is five times higher than during
the low-level period. The soft X-ray spectral component is most likely
associated with accretion shocks, as opposed to jet activity, given the absence
of forbidden emission lines of low-excitation species (e.g., [O I]) in optical
spectra of EX Lup obtained during outburst. The hard X-ray spectral component,
meanwhile, is most likely associated with a smothered stellar corona. The UV
emission is reminiscent of accretion events, such as those already observed
with the Optical/UV Monitor from other accreting pre-main sequence stars, and
is evidently dominated by emission from accretion hot spots. The large
photoelectric absorption of the active stellar corona is most likely due to

absorbers are believed to trace shock-heated gas in the Warm-Hot Intergalactic
Medium (WHIM) and may thus play a key role in the search for the missing
baryons in the present-day Universe. When compared to observations, the
predicted distributions of the different OVI line parameters (column density,
Doppler parameter, rest equivalent width) from our simulations exhibit a lack
of strong OVI absorbers. This suggests that physical processes on sub-grid
scales (e.g. turbulence) may strongly influence the observed properties of OVI
systems. We find that the intervening OVI absorption arises mainly in highly
metal-enriched (0.1 << Z/Z_sun < 1) gas at typical overdensities of 1 <<
rho/<rho> < 100. One third of the OVI absorbers in our simulation are found to
trace gas at temperatures T < 10^5 K, while the rest arises in gas at higher
temperatures around T =10^5.3 K. The OVI resides in a similar region of
(rho,T)-space as much of the shock-heated baryonic matter, but the vast
majority of this gas has a lower metal content and does not give rise to
detectable OVI absorption As a consequence of the patchy metal distribution,
OVI absorbers in our simulations trace only a very small fraction of the cosmic
baryons (<2 percent) and the cosmic metals. Instead, these systems presumably
trace previously shock-heated, metal-rich material from galactic winds that is
now cooling. The common approach of comparing OVI and HI column densities to
estimate the physical conditions in intervening absorbers from QSO observations
may be misleading, as most of the HI (and most of the gas mass) is not
physically connected with the high-metallicity patches that give rise to the
OVI absorption.

Perrault building of Observatoire de Paris on 23-25 July 2009. The Colloquium
was held in the spirit of the Chalonge School, putting together real
cosmological and astrophysical data and hard theory predictive approach in the
framework of the Standard Model of the Universe. Peter Biermann, James Bullock,
Claudio Destri, Hector de Vega, Massimo Giovannini, Sasha Kashlinsky, Eiichiro
Komatsu, Anthony Lasenby and Norma G. Sanchez present here their highlights of
the Colloquium. The summary and conclusions by H. J. de Vega, M. C. Falvella
and N. G. Sanchez stress among other points: (i) the primordial CMB
fluctuations are almost gaussian, large primordial non-gaussianity and large
running index are strongly disfavored. The primordial graviton ratio r is
predicted in the effective theory of inflation to be between 0.021 and 0.053,
at reach of the next CMB observations. (ii) Dark energy observations are
consistent with the cosmological constant. (iii) The cosmic ray positron excess
recently observed is explained by natural astrophysical processes. (iv) The
heavy dark matter particle candidates ( > 1 GeV, wimps) became strongly
disfavored, while cored (non cusped) dark matter halos and light (keV scale
mass) dark matter are being increasingly favored from theory and astrophysical
observations. The Daniel Chalonge Medal 2009 was awarded to Peter Biermann
during the Colloquium. Photos of the Colloquium are included.

carried out in order to identify z~ 5 Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) across ten
widely-separated fields to I_{AB}=26.3. The redshifts of seventy 4.6<z<5.6 LBGs
were identified. We find no significant difference in the frequency of high
equivalent-width line emitters between z~3 and our z~5 samples. The rest-frame
UV continuum slope of a typical z~5 line-emitting galaxy is bluer than that of
a typical break-only galaxy, a difference that is difficult to explain purely
by differences in the ages of their stellar populations. Variation in
metallicity and/or dust extinction can more straightforwardly account for this
difference. Given their UV-continuum slopes, the typical z~5 LBGs have
metallicities a factor of three lower than those of LBGs at z~3. HST imaging
indicates that a large majority of the spectroscopically-confirmed LBGs in our
sample are members of multiple systems and/or show disturbed morphology. Using
local LBG analogues as a model, this multiplicity could be explained either by
super-starburst regions within a larger unseen structure, or by a high
incidence of merging events at this epoch. The current data cannot distinguish
between these two possibilities. The surface density of z~5 LBGs in two fields
is considerably higher than in the rest. Both show clear spikes in their
redshift distributions indicating strong three-dimensional clustering. Neither
structure can be bound given their depth in redshift and probably extend beyond
the observed fields. The three-dimensional distances between LBGs in the
structures are too large for them to have triggered their starbursts through
mutual gravitational interaction, and so it is likely that the short-lived LBGs
represent only a small fraction of the baryons in the structures.

cylindrical explosions, cylindrical rotating disks, magnetized Bondi tests, and
the collapse of a magnetized rotating star. Some of the more stringent tests

that it had an extraordinarily fast rise time of <= 10 days and a peak absolute
B magnitude of -15.4 +/- 0.2 at most, making it one of the most subluminous SN

unambiguously shows the presence of intermediate-mass elements which are likely

can be measured using direct stellar, gas, and maser kinematics. These objects,
however, do not represent the demographics of more typical L< L* galaxies. This
study transcends prior limitations to probe BHs that are an order of magnitude
lower in mass, using BH mass measurements derived from the dynamics of H_2O
megamasers in circumnuclear disks. The masers trace the Keplerian rotation of
circumnuclear molecular disks starting at radii of a few tenths of a pc from
the central BH. Modeling of the rotation curves, presented by Kuo et al.
(2010), yields BH masses with exquisite precision. We present stellar velocity
dispersion measurements for a sample of nine megamaser disk galaxies based on
long-slit observations using the B&C spectrograph on the Dupont telescope and
the DIS spectrograph on the 3.5m telescope at Apache Point. We also perform
bulge-to-disk decomposition of a subset of five of these galaxies with SDSS
imaging. The maser galaxies as a group fall below the M_BH-sigma* relation
defined by elliptical galaxies. We show, now with very precise BH mass
measurements, that the low-scatter power-law relation between M_BH and sigma*
seen in elliptical galaxies is not universal. The elliptical galaxy M_BH-sigma*
relation cannot be used to derive the BH mass function at low mass or the
zeropoint for active BH masses. The processes (perhaps BH self-regulation or
minor merging) that operate at higher mass have not effectively established an
M_BH-sigma* relation in this low-mass regime.

synthesis of pectate lyases (Pels), the major virulence factors in Dickeya

degradation of pectin by Pel enzymes and the genetic regulation of pel genes by
2-keto-3-deoxygluconate (KDG), a catabolite product of pectin which inactivates
KdgR, one of the main repressors of pel genes. This modeling scheme takes into
account the fact that the system is composed of two time-varying compartments:
the extracellular medium, where Pel enzymes cleave pectin into oligomers, and
the bacterial cytoplasm where, after internalization, oligomers are converted
to KDG. Using the quasi-stationary state approximations, the model consists of
some nonlinear differential equations for which most of the parameters could be
estimated from the literature or from independent experiments. The few
remaining unknown parameters were obtained by fitting the model equations
against a set of Pel activity data. Model predictions were verified by
measuring the time courses of bacterial growth, Pel production, pel mRNA
accumulation and pectin consumption under various growth conditions. This work
reveals that pectin is almost totally consumed before the burst of Pel
production. This paradoxical behaviour can be interpreted as an evolutionary
strategy to control the diffusion process so that as soon as a small amount of
pectin is detected by the bacteria in its surroundings it anticipates more
pectin to come. The model also predicts the possibility of bistable steady
states in the presence of constant pectin compounds.

organic salts, and the recently discovered iron pnictides, superconductivity is
found in close proximity to a magnetically ordered state. The character of the
proximate magnetic phase is thus believed to be crucial for understanding the
differences between the various families of unconventional superconductors and
the mechanism of superconductivity. Unlike the AFM order in cuprates, the
nature of the magnetism and of the underlying electronic state in the iron
pnictide superconductors is not well understood. Neither density functional
theory nor models based on atomic physics and superexchange, account for the
small size of the magnetic moment. Many low energy probes such as transport,
STM and ARPES measured strong anisotropy of the electronic states akin to the
nematic order in a liquid crystal, but there is no consensus on its physical
origin, and a three dimensional picture of electronic states and its relations
to the optical conductivity in the magnetic state is lacking. Using a first
principles approach, we obtained the experimentally observed magnetic moment,
optical conductivity, and the anisotropy of the electronic states. The theory
connects ARPES, which measures one particle electronic states, optical
spectroscopy, probing the particle hole excitations of the solid and neutron
scattering which measures the magnetic moment. We predict a manifestation of
the anisotropy in the optical conductivity, and we show that the magnetic phase
arises from the paramagnetic phase by a large gain of the Hund's rule coupling
energy and a smaller loss of kinetic energy, indicating that iron pnictides
represent a new class of compounds where the nature of magnetism is
intermediate between the spin density wave of almost independent particles, and
the antiferromagnetic state of local moments.

are large uncertainties in the normalization of the predictions using event

tune the event generators. Predictions using Pythia for anti-deuteron
production in Upsilon decay are compared to measurements by the CLEO

producing pairs of baryons, at least in Upsilon decay into three gluons, and
that the standard value of the coalescence parameter underpredicts the
probability for formation of a deuteron from a neutron and proton with small
relative momentum. In the case of the X(3872), we discuss a proposed upper
bound on the prompt cross section at the Tevatron that has been used as an
argument against the X(3872) being a loosely-bound charm meson molecule. We
demonstrate that this proposed upper bound is invalid by showing that the

provided by a force dependent-on-velocity. In the case of the superconducting

tricritical point is at a large strange mass value, the strange sector as well
as the \eta-a_0 sector decouples from the light degrees of freedom which
determines the thermodynamics. By tracing this decoupling we arrive from the
original U(3)_L x U(3)_R symmetric model, going through the U(2)_L x U(2)_R
symmetric one, at the SU(2)_L x SU(2)_R linear sigma model. One-loop level beta
functions for the running of the parameters in each of these models and
tree-level matching of the coupling of these models performed at intermediate
scales are used to determine the influence of the heavy sector on the
parameters of the SU(2)_L x SU(2)_R linear sigma model. By investigating the
thermodynamics of this latter model we identified the tricritical surface of

compound of the recently discovered iron pnictide superconductors, LaFeAsO, and
a comparison material LaFePO. Comparing the WFs for the stripe
antiferromagnetic order with those for no magnetic order, the difference is a
significant spreading (``{\it de}localization'') of specifically the $d_{xy}$
and $d_{xz}$ (but not $d_{yz}$) WFs, where parallel Fe spins lie along the $x$
direction. The WF basis gives a tight-binding representation of the first
principles, density functional based Fe-derived bands. Comparing hopping
parameters, it is found that changes due to stripe antiferromagnetism, even if
it is weak, enables more isotropic hopping involving spin-majority electrons in
the Fe $3d_{xz}$ (but not the $3d_{yz}$) orbital. This change,
counterintuitively, actually reinforces electronic anisotropy. Further insight
is gained by comparing the WFs of LaFeAsO and LaFePO, identifying how the
difference in WFs is related to the difference in hopping integrals and showing
how the pnictide atom is influential in forming the stripe antiferromagnetism.
Kinetic energy considerations suggest that orbital fluctuation, in addition to
spin fluctuation, may contribute to the decrease in observed ordered moment

the mean slope of the total mass density profile is <gamma'> = 2.078+/-0.027

radius and central mass density, in the sense that denser galaxies have steeper
profiles; iii) the dark matter fraction within reff/2 is a monotonically
increasing function of galaxy mass and size; iv) the dimensional mass M_dim is
proportional to the total mass, and both increase more rapidly than stellar
mass M*; v) the Mass Plane (MP), obtained by replacing surface brightness with
surface mass density in the FP, is found to be tighter and closer to the virial
relation than the FP and the M*P, indicating that the scatter of those
relations is dominated by stellar population effects; vi) we construct the
Fundamental Hyper-Plane by adding stellar masses to the MP and find the M*
coefficient to be consistent with zero and no residual intrinsic scatter. Our
results demonstrate that the dynamical structure of ETGs is not scale invariant

writing a program which generates a program. The arr function required of all
Arrows turns arbitrary host language expressions into guest language
expressions; because of this, Arrows may be used for metaprogramming only when
the guest language is a superset of the host language. This restriction is also
present in multi-level languages which offer unlimited cross-level persistence.
<p> This paper introduces generalized arrows and proves that they generalize
Arrows in the following sense: every Arrow in a programming language arises
from a generalized arrow with that language's term category as its codomain.
Generalized arrows impose no containment relationship between the guest
language and host language; they facilitate heterogeneous metaprogramming. The
category having all generalized arrows as its morphisms and the category having
all multi-level languages as its morphisms are isomorphic categories. This is
proven formally in Coq, and the proof is offered as justification for the
assertion that multi-level languages are generalized arrows. <p> Combined with
the existence of a particular kind of retraction in the host language, this
proof can be used to define an invertible translation from two-level terms to
one-level terms parameterized by a generalized arrow instance. This is
ergonomically significant: it lets guest language providers write generalized
arrow instances while the users of those guest languages write multi-level
terms. This is beneficial because implementing a generalized arrow instance is
easier than modifying a compiler, whereas writing two-level terms is easier
than manipulating generalized arrow terms.

292 background field stars to investigate the uptake of CO from the gas to icy
grain mantles on dust within the cloud. On the assumption that the reservoir of
CO in the ices is well represented by the combined abundances of solid CO and
solid CO2 (which forms by oxidation of CO on the dust), we find that the total
column density (gas + solid) correlates tightly with visual extinction (Av)
over the range 5 < Av < 30 mag, i.e., up to the highest extinctions covered by
our sample. The mean depletion of gas-phase CO increases monotonically from
negligible levels for Av < 5 to approximately 30 percent at Av = 10 and 60
percent at Av = 30. As these results refer to line-of-sight averages, they must
be considered lower limits to the actual depletion at loci deep within the

high levels of depletion to be reached in dense cores on timescales of order
0.6 Myr, comparable with their expected lifetimes. Dispersal of cores during
star formation may be effective in maintaining observable levels of gaseous CO
on the longer timescales estimated for the age of the cloud.

services, e.g., P4P, solutions based on locality information provision for P2P
traffic localization will soon approach their capability limits. A natural
question is: can we do any better provided that no further locality information
improvement can be made? This paper shows how the utility of locality
information could be limited by conventional P2P data scheduling algorithms,
even as sophisticated as the local rarest first policy.
  Network coding's simplified data scheduling makes it competent for improving
P2P application's throughput. Instead of only using locality information in the
topology construction, this paper proposes the locality-aware network coding
(LANC) that uses locality information in both the topology construction and
downloading decision, and demonstrates its exceptional ability for P2P traffic
localization. The randomization introduced by network coding enhances the
chance for a peer to find innovative blocks in its neighborhood. Aided by
proper locality-awareness, the probability for a peer to get innovative blocks
from its proximity will increase as well, resulting in more efficient use of
network resources. Extensive simulation results show that LANC can
significantly reduce P2P traffic redundancy without sacrificing
application-level performance. Aided by the same locality knowledge, the
traffic redundancies of LANC in most cases are less than 50\% of the current
best approach that does not use network coding.

in which reduction is to the elements of the number operator basis of a system,
triggered by the occurrence of annihilation or creation (or lowering or
raising) operators in the time evolution of a system. It is from these operator
types that the acronym `LARC' is derived. Reduction does not occur immediately
after the trigger event; it occurs at some later time with probability $P_t$
per unit time, where $P_t$ is very small. Localisation of macroscopic objects
occurs in the natural way: photons from an illumination field are reflected off
a body and later absorbed by another body. Each possible absorption of a photon
by a molecule in the second body generates annihilation and raising operators,
which in turn trigger a probability per unit time $P_t$ of a state reduction
into the number operator basis for the photon field and the number operator
basis of the electron orbitals of the molecule. Since all photons in the
illumination field have come from the location of the first body, wherever that
is, a single reduction leads to a reduction of the position state of the first
body relative to the second, with a total probability of $m\tau_L$, where $m$
is the number of photon absorption events. Unusually for a reduction theory,
the larc theory is naturally relativistic.

indistinguishable fermions. Specifically, we have proposed a geometric
entanglement measure for N spin-1/2 fermions distributed over 2L modes (single
particle states). The measure is defined on the 2L qubit space isomorphic to
the Fock space for 2L single particle states. This entanglement measure is
defined for a given partition of 2L modes containing m >= 2 subsets. Thus this
measure applies to m <= 2L partite fermionic system where L is any finite
number, giving the number of sites. The Hilbert spaces associated with these
subsets may have different dimensions. Further, we have defined the local
quantum operations with respect to a given partition of modes. This definition
is generic and unifies different ways of dividing a fermionic system into
subsystems. We have shown, using a representative case, that the geometric
measure is invariant under local unitaries corresponding to a given partition.
We explicitly demonstrate the use of the measure to calculate multipartite
entanglement in some correlated electron systems. To the best of our knowledge,
there is no usable entanglement measure of m > 3 partite fermionic systems in
the literature, so that this is the first measure of multipartite entanglement
for fermionic systems going beyond the bipartite and tripartite cases.

been intensively studied from several aspects: e.g., the time complexity, the

understood for networks with multiple multicast sessions. Recently, Wang and
Shroff showed that the solvability of networks with two unit-rate multicast

that for the 2-URMS networks: $1)$ the solvability can be determined with time
$O(|E|)$; $2)$ a solution can be constructed with time $O(|E|)$; $3)$ an
optimal solution can be obtained in polynomial time; $4)$ the number of

singularity with a single scalar field which couples non-minimally to gravity.
We show that in the case that gravity couples linearly to the field, some
severe conditions on the field's potential have to be imposed. However, in
non-linear case, it is quite generic to avoid the singularity with single
scalar field.

physical processes, such as planet formation, star-disk interactions, mass
accretion, and ejection. The complex morphological structure of these
environments has been confirmed by the now quite rich data sets obtained for a
few objects by near-infrared long-baseline interferometry. We gathered numerous
interferometric measurements for the young star HD163296 with various
interferometers (VLTI, IOTA, KeckI and CHARA), allowing for the first time an
image independent of any a priori model to be reconstructed. Using the
Multi-aperture image Reconstruction Algorithm (MiRA), we reconstruct images of
HD 163296 in the H and K bands. We compare these images with reconstructed
images obtained from simulated data using a physical model of the environment
of HD 163296. We obtain model-independent $H$ and $K$-band images of the
surroundings of HD 163296. The images present several significant features that
we can relate to an inclined asymmetric flared disk around HD 163296 with the
strongest intensity at about 4-5 mas. Because of the incomplete spatial
frequency coverage, we cannot state whether each of them individually is
peculiar in any way. For the first time, milli-arcsecond images of the
environment of a young star are produced. These images confirm that the
morphology of the close environment of young stars is more complex than the
simple models used in the literature so far.

and shear melting is described consistently. Dependences of friction force on
temperature of lubricant, shear velocity of rubbing surfaces, and pressure upon

torus link. They are geometrically simple and contain many examples of the
smallest volume hyperbolic knots. Many are also Lorenz links.
  We study the geometry of twisted torus links and related generalizations. We
determine upper bounds on their hyperbolic volumes that depend only on the
number of strands being twisted. We exhibit a family of twisted torus knots for
which this upper bound is sharp, and another family with volumes approaching
infinity. Consequently, we show there exist twisted torus knots with
arbitrarily large braid index and yet bounded volume.

the third generation quarks via Yukawa interactions, covering all the allowed
representations under the standard model gauge groups. We first review tree and
loop level bounds on these states. We then discuss tree level decays and
loop-induced decays to photon or gluon plus top. The main decays at tree level
are to W b and/or Z and Higgs plus top via the new Yukawa couplings. The
radiative loop decays turn out to be quite close to the naive estimate: in all
cases, in the allowed perturbative parameter space, the branching ratios are
mildly sensitive on the new Yukawa couplings and small. We therefore conclude
that the new states can be observed at the LHC and that the tree level decays
can allow to distinguish the different representations. Moreover, the
observation of the radiative decays at the LHC would suggest a large Yukawa
coupling in the non-perturbative regime.

integral and Hubbard correlation on the enhancement of persistent current in

compared to the traditional nearest-neighbor hopping model and the current
