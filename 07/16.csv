in more than one space dimension must either confront the challenge of
controlling errors in the discrete divergence of the magnetic field, or else be
faced with nonlinear numerical instabilities. One approach for controlling the
discrete divergence is through a so-called constrained transport method, which
is based on first predicting a magnetic field through a standard finite volume
solver, and then correcting this field through the appropriate use of a
magnetic vector potential. In this work we develop a constrained transport
method for the 3D ideal MHD equations that is based on a high-resolution wave
propagation scheme. Our proposed scheme is the 3D extension of the 2D scheme
developed by Rossmanith [SIAM J. Sci. Comp. 28, 1766 (2006)], and is based on
the high-resolution wave propagation method of Langseth and LeVeque [J. Comp.
Phys. 165, 126 (2000)]. In particular, in our extension we take great care to
maintain the three most important properties of the 2D scheme: (1) all
quantities, including all components of the magnetic field and magnetic
potential, are treated as cell-centered; (2) we develop a high-resolution wave
propagation scheme for evolving the magnetic potential; and (3) we develop a
wave limiting approach that is applied during the vector potential evolution,
which controls unphysical oscillations in the magnetic field. One of the key
numerical difficulties that is novel to 3D is that the transport equation that
must be solved for the magnetic vector potential is only weakly hyperbolic. In
presenting our numerical algorithm we describe how to numerically handle this
problem of weak hyperbolicity, as well as how to choose an appropriate gauge
condition. The resulting scheme is applied to several numerical test cases.

technique, that achieves the best combination of high angular resolution and
sensitivity possible today at near-infrared wavelengths. Given that the events
are fixed in time, that the sources are occulted randomly, and that the
telescope use is minimal, the technique is very well suited for service mode
observations. We have established a program of routine LO observations at the
VLT observatory, especially designed to take advantage of short breaks
available in-between other programs. We have used the ISAAC instrument in burst
mode, capable of producing continuous read-outs at millisecond rates on a
suitable subwindow. Given the random nature of the source selection, our aim
has been primarily the investigation of a large number of stellar sources at
the highest angular resolution in order to detect new binaries. Serendipitous
results such as resolved sources and detection of circumstellar components were
also anticipated. We have recorded the signal from background stars for a few
seconds, around the predicted time of occultation by the Moon's dark limb. At
millisecond time resolution, a characteristic diffraction pattern can be
observed. Patterns for two or more sources superimpose linearly, and this
property is used for the detection of binary stars. The detailed analysis of
the diffraction fringes can be used to measure specific properties such as the
stellar angular size and the presence of extended light sources such as a
circumstellar shell. We present a list of 191 stars for which LO data could be
recorded and analyzed. Results include the detection of 16 binary and 2 triple

excellent particle identification capabilities, is uniquely positioned to carry

is investigated using the post-Newtonian (PN) approximation and the
perturbative self-force (SF) formalism. A particular gauge-invariant observable
quantity is computed as a function of the binary's orbital frequency. The
conservative effect induced by the gravitational SF is obtained numerically
with high precision, and compared to the PN prediction developed to high order.
The PN calculation involves the computation of the 3PN regularized metric at
the location of the particle. Its divergent self-field is regularized by means
of dimensional regularization. The poles proportional to 1/(d-3) which occur
within dimensional regularization at the 3PN order disappear from the final
gauge-invariant result. The leading 4PN and next-to-leading 5PN conservative
logarithmic contributions originating from gravitational-wave tails are also
obtained. Making use of these exact PN results, some previously unknown PN
coefficients are measured up to the very high 7PN order by fitting to the
numerical self-force data. Using just the 2PN and new logarithmic terms, the
value of the 3PN coefficient is also confirmed numerically with very high

test of the very different regularization methods used in both SF and PN
formalisms, and illustrates the complementarity of these approximation schemes

for such quantum time travel, the quantum description of CTCs based on
post-selected teleportation (P-CTCs). We compare the theory of P-CTCs to
previously proposed quantum theories of time travel: the theory is physically
inequivalent to Deutsch's theory of CTCs, but it is consistent with
path-integral approaches (which are the best suited for analyzing quantum field
theory in curved spacetime). We derive the dynamical equations that a
chronology-respecting system interacting with a CTC will experience. We discuss
the possibility of time travel in the absence of general relativistic closed
timelike curves, and investigate the implications of P-CTCs for enhancing the

large sample of star-forming (SF) galaxies at z=0.84 from the HiZELS survey,
over 1.3 deg^2 in the COSMOS and UKIDSS UDS fields. By taking advantage of a
truly panoramic coverage, from the field to a rich cluster, it is shown that
both mass and environment play crucial roles in determining the properties of
SF galaxies. The median specific SFR declines with mass in all environments,
and the fraction of galaxies forming stars declines from ~40%, for M~10^10M_sun
to effectively zero at M>10^11.5M_sun, confirming that mass-downsizing is
generally in place by z~1. The fraction of SF galaxies also falls as a function
of local environmental density from ~40% in the field to approaching zero at
rich group/cluster densities. When SF does occur in high density regions, it is
merger-dominated and, if only non-merging SF galaxies are considered, then the
environment and mass trends are even stronger and largely independent, as in
the local Universe. The median SFR of SF galaxies is found to increase with
density up to intermediate (group or cluster outskirts) densities; this is
clearly seen as a change in the faint-end slope of the H-alpha LF from steep
(-1.9), in poor fields, to shallow (-1.1) in groups and clusters.
Interestingly, the relation between median SFR and environment is only found
for low to moderate-mass galaxies (below ~10^10.6M_sun), and is not seen for
massive SF galaxies. Overall, these observations provide a detailed view over a
sufficiently large range of mass and environment to reconcile previous
observational claims: mass is the primary predictor of SF activity at z~1, but
the environment, while enhancing the median SFR of (lower-mass) SF galaxies, is
ultimately responsible for suppressing SF activity in all galaxies above
surface densities of 10-30 Mpc^-2 (groups and clusters).

gamma-ray sources at high Galactic latitude (|b| > 15 degrees) in the First
Fermi-LAT catalogue (1FGL), 316 have no obvious associations at other
wavelengths. In this paper, we apply the K-means unsupervised classification
algorithm to isolate potential counterparts for 18 unassociated Fermi sources
contained within a 3000 square degree `overlap region' of the sky intensively
covered in radio and optical wavelengths. Combining our results with previous
works, we reach potential associations for 119 out of the 128 Fermi sources
within said region. If these associations are correct, we estimate that less
than 20% of all remaining unassociated 1FGL sources at high Galactic latitude
(|b| > 15 degrees) might host `exotic' counterparts distinct from known classes
of gamma-ray emitters. Potentially even these outliers could be explained by
high-redshift/dust-obscured analogues of the associated sample or by
intrinsically faint radio objects. Although such estimate leaves some room for
novel discoveries, it severely restricts the possibility of detecting dark
matter subhaloes and other unconventional types of gamma-ray emitters in the

end of the flux density distribution will be a complex process that might only
be achieved through a clever combination of refined classification algorithms,
multi-wavelength efforts, and dedicated optical spectroscopy.

in galaxies, from scales of ~kpc to deep in the potential of a central black
hole (BH). We compare these analytic calculations to numerical simulations and
use them to develop a sub-grid model of BH growth that can be incorporated into
semi-analytic models or cosmological simulations. Both analytic calculations
and simulations argue that the strongest torque on gas arises when
non-axisymmetric perturbations to the stellar gravitational potential produces
orbit crossings and shocks in the gas. This is true both at large radii ~0.01-1
kpc, where bar-like modes dominate the non-axisymmetric potential, and at
smaller radii <10 pc, where a lopsided/eccentric disk dominates. The
traditional orbit crossing criterion is not always adequate to predict the
locations of, and inflow due to, shocks in gas+stellar disks with finite sound
speeds. We derive a modified criterion that predicts the presence of shocks in
stellar dominated systems even absent formal orbit crossing. We then derive
analytic expressions for the loss of angular momentum and the resulting gas
inflow rates in the presence of such shocks. We test our analytic predictions
using hydrodynamic simulations at a range of galactic scales, and show that
they successfully predict the mass inflow rates and quasi-steady gas surface
densities with small scatter (0.3 dex). We use our analytic results to
construct a new estimate of the BH accretion rate given galaxy properties at
larger radii. This captures the key scalings in the numerical simulations.
Alternate estimates such as the local viscous accretion rate or the spherical
Bondi rate fail systematically to reproduce the simulations.

allows in principle the electroweak symmetry to be broken with little

this problem, we consider the possibility of additional SU(3)-breaking

$B(E2; 2^+_1\rightarrow 0^+_1)$ values, in these nuclei is predicted from
proton and neutron pairing-gap information. The agreement with the Ni isotopes
is excellent and recent experimental results support the trend in the Sn

nuclear-structure properties. In particular, it indicates that many-body

majority of stars, including our Sun. The study of white dwarfs has potential
applications to different fields of astrophysics. In particular, they can be
used as independent reliable cosmic clocks, and can also provide valuable
information about the fundamental parameters of a wide variety of stellar
populations, like our Galaxy and open and globular clusters. In addition, the
high densities and temperatures characterizing white dwarfs allow to use these
stars as cosmic laboratories for studying physical processes under extreme
conditions that cannot be achieved in terrestrial laboratories. They can be
used to constrain fundamental properties of elementary particles such as axions
and neutrinos, and to study problems related to the variation of fundamental
constants.
  In this work, we review the essentials of the physics of white dwarf stars.
Special emphasis is placed on the physical processes that lead to the formation
of white dwarfs as well as on the different energy sources and processes
responsible for chemical abundance changes that occur along their evolution.
Moreover, in the course of their lives, white dwarfs cross different
pulsational instability strips. The existence of these instability strips
provides astronomers with an unique opportunity to peer into their internal
structure that would otherwise remain hidden from observers. We will show that
this allows to measure with unprecedented precision the stellar masses and to
infer their envelope thicknesses, to probe the core chemical stratification,
and to detect rotation rates and magnetic fields. Consequently, in this work,
we also review the pulsational properties of white dwarfs and the most recent
applications of white dwarf asteroseismology.

may affect the formation and evolution of planetary systems. Accurate stellar
abundances require the determinations of reliable physical parameters, namely
the effective temperature, surface gravity, microturbulent velocity, and
metallicity. This work presents the homogeneous derivation of such parameters
for a large sample of stars hosting planets (N=117), as well as a control
sample of disk stars not known to harbor giant, closely orbiting planets
(N=145). Stellar parameters and iron abundances are derived from an automated
analysis technique developed for this work. As previously found in the
literature, the results in this study indicate that the metallicity
distribution of planet hosting stars is more metal-rich by ~0.15 dex when
compared to the control sample stars. A segregation of the sample according to
planet mass indicates that the metallicity distribution of stars hosting only
Neptunian-mass planets (with no Jovian-mass planets) tends to be more
metal-poor in comparison with that obtained for stars hosting a closely
orbiting Jovian planet. The significance of this difference in metallicity
arises from a homogeneous analysis of samples of FGK dwarfs which do not
include the cooler and more problematic M dwarfs. This result would indicate
that there is a possible link between planet mass and metallicity such that
metallicity plays a role in setting the mass of the most massive planet.
Further confirmation, however, must await larger samples.

closed-loop control, finding that both control methods give equivalent Strehl
ratios of up to ~ 7% in I-band and similar rejection of temporal power.
Therefore, we find that open-loop control of MEMS on-sky is as effective as
closed-loop control. Furthermore, after operating the system for three years,
we find MEMS technology to function well in the observatory environment. We
construct an error budget for the system, accounting for 130 nm of wavefront
error out of 190 nm error in the science-camera PSFs. We find that the dominant
known term is internal static error, and that the known contributions to the

nodes is often required. One way to study such a distributed system is by
defining games, which involve selfish nodes that make strategic choices on
replicating content in their local limited memory (cache) or accessing content
from other nodes for a cost. These Selfish Replication games have been
introduced in [8] for nodes that do not have any capacity limits, leaving the
capacitated problem, i.e. Capacitated Selfish Replication (CSR) games, open.
  In this work, we first form the model of the CSR games, for which we perform
a Nash equilibria analysis. In particular, we focus on hierarchical networks,
given their extensive use to model communication costs of content delivery in
P2P systems. We present an exact polynomial-time algorithm for any hierarchical
network, under two constraints on the utility functions: 1) ""Nearer is better"",
i.e. the closest the content is to the node the less its access cost is, and 2)
""Independence of irrelevant alternatives"", i.e. aggregation of individual node
preferences. This generalization represents a vast class of utilities and more
interestingly allows each of the nodes to have simultaneously completely
different functional forms of utility functions. In this general framework, we
present CSR games results on arbitrary networks and outline the boundary
between intractability and effective computability in terms of the network
structure, object preferences, and the total number of objects. Moreover, we
prove that the problem of equilibria existence becomes NP-hard for general CSR
games.

Letter, we study the evolution of dip-shear as well as the conventional
twist-shear in a $\delta$-sunspot using high-resolution vector magnetograms
from {\it Hinode} space mission. We monitor these shears in a penumbral region
located close to flare site during 12 and 13 December 2006. It is found that:
(i) the penumbral area close to the flaring site shows high value of
twist-shear and dip-shear as compared to other parts of penumbra, (ii) after
the flare the value of dip-shear drops in this region while the twist-shear in
this region tends to increase after the flare, (iii) the dip-shear and
twist-shear are correlated such that pixels with large twist-shear also tend to
exhibit large dip-shear, and (iv) the correlation between the twist-shear and
dip-shear is tighter after the flare. The present study suggests that
monitoring twist-shear during the flare alone is not sufficient but we need to
monitor it together with dip-shear.

and Kosevich, views each dislocation as a source of incompatibility of strains.
We show that this concept can be employed efficiently in the Landau free energy
functional to develop a mean-field mesoscopic model of materials with
dislocations. The order parameters that represent the distortion of the parent
phase (often of cubic symmetry) are written in terms of elastic strains which
are themselves coupled by incompatibility constraints. Since the ""strength"" of
the incompatibility depends on the local density of dislocations, the presence
of dislocations affects the evolution of the microstructure and vice versa. An
advantage of this formulation is that long range anisotropic interactions
between dislocations appear naturally in the formulation of the free energy.
Owing to the distortion of the crystal structure around dislocations, their
presence in multiphase materials causes heterogeneous nucleation of the product
phase and thus also shifts of the transformation temperature. This novel
field-theoretical approach is very convenient as it allows to bridge the gap in
studying the behavior of materials at the length and time scales that are not
attainable by atomistic or macroscopic models.

  Mechanical Systems from a Hamiltonian Perspective",,,,,"math-ph math.MP math.SG physics.comp-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","  On this paper, we have proposed an approach to observe the time-centered
difference scheme for dissipative mechanical systems from a Hamiltonian
perspective and to introduce the idea of symplectic algorithm to dissipative
systems. The dissipative mechanical systems discussed in this paper are finite
dimensional.This approach is based upon a proposition: for any nonconservative
classical mechanical system and any initial condition, there exists a
conservative one; the two systems share one and only one common phase curve;
the Hamiltonian of the conservative system is the sum of the total energy of
the nonconservative system on the aforementioned phase curve and a constant
depending on the initial condition. Hence, this approach entails substituting
an infinite number of conservative systems for a dissipative mechanical system
corresponding to varied initial conditions. Therefore, first we utilize the
time-centered difference scheme directly to solve the original system, after
which we substitute the numerical solution for the analytical solution to
construct a conservative force equal to the dissipative force on the phase
curve, such that we would obtain a substituting conservative system
numerically. Finally, we use the time-centered scheme to integrate the
substituting system numerically. We will find an interesting fact that the
latter solution resulting from the substituting system is equivalent to that of
the former. Indeed, there are two transition matrices within time grid points:
the first one is unsymplectic and the second symplectic. In fact, the
time-centered scheme for dissipative systems can be thought of as an algorithm
that preserves the symplectic structure of the substituting conservative
systems. In addition, via numerical examples we find that the time-centered
scheme preserves the total energy of dissipative systems.

capacity for certain quantum channels carrying classical information. We first
concentrate on the product-state capacity of a particular quantum channel, that
is, the capacity which is achieved by encoding the output states from a source
into codewords comprised of states taken from ensembles of non-entangled states
and sending them over copies of the quantum channel. Using the ""single-letter""
formula proved independently by Holevo and by Schumacher and Westmoreland we
obtain the product-state capacity of the qubit quantum amplitude-damping
channel, which is determined by a transcendental equation in a single real
variable and can be solved numerically. We demonstrate that the product-state
capacity of this channel can be achieved using a minimal ensemble of
non-orthogonal pure states. Next we consider the classical capacity of two
quantum channels with memory, namely a periodic channel with quantum
depolarising channel branches and a convex combination of quantum channels. We
prove that the classical capacity for each of the classical memory channels
mentioned above is, in fact, equal to the respective product-state capacities.
For those channels this means that the classical capacity is achieved without
the use of entangled input-states. Next we introduce the channel coding theorem
for memoryless quantum channels, providing a known proof by Winter for the
strong converse of the theorem. We then consider the strong converse to the
channel coding theorem for a periodic quantum channel.

or decoherence functional gives rise to a vector valued measure whose domain is
the algebra of events or physical questions. This gives an immediate handle on
the question of the extension of the decoherence functional to the sigma
algebra generated by this algebra of events. It is on the latter that the
physical transition amplitudes directly give the decoherence functional. Since
the full sigma algebra contains physically interesting questions, like the
return question, extending the decoherence functional to these more general
questions is important. We show that the decoherence functional, and hence the
quantum measure, extends if and only if the associated vector measure does. We
give two examples of quantum systems whose decoherence functionals do not
extend: one is a unitary system with finitely many states, and the other is a
quantum sequential growth model for causal sets. These examples fail to extend
in the formal mathematical sense and we speculate on whether the conditions for
extension are unphysically strong.

tasks in multi-agent systems including motion coordination, clock

allow for the presence of misbehaving agents, whose behavior deviate from the
nominal consensus evolution. We model misbehaviors as unknown and unmeasurable
inputs affecting the network, and we cast the misbehavior detection and
identification problem into an unknown-input system theoretic framework. We
consider two extreme cases of misbehaving agents, namely faulty (non-colluding)
and malicious (Byzantine) agents. First, we characterize the set of inputs that
allow misbehaving agents to affect the consensus network while remaining
undetected and/or unidentified from certain observing agents. Second, we
provide worst-case bounds for the number of concurrent faulty or malicious
agents that can be detected and identified. Precisely, the consensus network
needs to be 2k+1 (resp. k+1) connected for k malicious (resp. faulty) agents to
be generically detectable and identifiable by every well behaving agent. Third,
we quantify the effect of undetectable inputs on the final consensus value.
Fourth, we design three algorithms to detect and identify misbehaving agents.
The first and the second algorithm apply fault detection techniques, and
affords complete detection and identification if global knowledge of the
network is available to each agent, at a high computational cost. The third
algorithm is designed to exploit the presence in the network of weakly
interconnected subparts, and provides local detection and identification of
misbehaving agents whose behavior deviates more than a threshold, which is
quantified in terms of the interconnection structure.

by tapering the magnetic field of the undulator. Also, significant increase in
power is achievable by starting the FEL process from a monochromatic seed
rather than from noise. This report proposes to make use of a cascade
self-seeding scheme with wake monochromators in a tunable-gap baseline
undulator at the European XFEL to create a source capable of delivering
coherent radiation of unprecedented characteristics at hard X-ray wavelengths.
Compared with SASE X-ray FEL parameters, the radiation from the new source has
three truly unique aspects: complete longitudinal and transverse coherence, and
a peak brightness three orders of magnitude higher than what is presently
available at LCLS. Additionally, the new source will generate hard X-ray beam
at extraordinary peak (TW) and average (kW) power level. The proposed source
can thus revolutionize fields like single biomolecule imaging, inelastic
scattering and nuclear resonant scattering. The self-seeding scheme with the
wake monochromator is extremely compact, and takes almost no cost and time to
be implemented. The upgrade proposed in this paper could take place during the
commissioning stage of the European XFEL, opening a vast new range of
applications from the very beginning of operations. We present feasibility

clumping in OB star winds. The action of clumping on strategic wind-formed
spectral lines is tested to steer the development of models for clumped winds
and thus improve the reliability of mass-loss determinations for massive
stars.The SiIV 1400 resonance line doublets of B0 to B5 supergiants are
analysed using empirical line-synthesis models. The focus is on decoding
information on wind clumping from measurements of ratios of the radial optical
depths (tau_(rad)(w)) of the red and blue components of the SiIV doublet. We
exploit in particular the fact that the two doublet components are decoupled
and formed independently for targets with relatively low wind terminal
velocities. Line-synthesis analyses reveal that the mean ratio of tau_(rad)(w)
of the blue to red SiIV components are rarely close to the canonical value of ~
2 (expected from atomic constants), and spread instead over a range of values
between ~1 and 2. These results are interpreted in terms of a photosphere that
is partially obscured by optically thick structures in the outflowing gas.The
spectroscopic signatures established in this study demonstrate the wide-spread
existence of wind clumping in B supergiants. The additional information in
unsaturated doublet profiles provides a means to quantify the porosity of the
winds.

linear optics and standard photon detection from spontaneous parametric

similar for BL Lac and FSRQ sources. However, only a small fraction (~1/15) of
the AT20G radio sources with flat radio spectrum, are detected by Fermi. To
understand if this correlation is real, we examine the selection effects
introduced by the flux limits of the radio and gamma-ray surveys, and the
importance of variability of the gamma-ray flux. We find that the
radio/gamma-ray flux correlation is real, but its slope is steeper than the
observed one, i.e. F_g~F_r^delta with delta in the range 1.25-1.5. The observed
F_g-F_r correlation and the fraction of radio sources detected by Fermi is
reproduced assuming a long term gamma-ray flux variability following a
log-normal probability distribution with standard deviation sigma>0.5
(corresponding to F_g varying by at least a factor 3). Such a variability is
compatible with what observed when comparing, for the sources in common, the
EGRET and the Fermi gamma-ray fluxes (even if the Fermi fluxes are averaged
over ~1 year). Another indication of variability is the non detection of 12 out

strong linear correlation between the gamma-ray and the radio luminosity of the

discussed: the contribution of blazars to the extragalactic gamma-ray

resolution of hydrodynamical structures. We apply the code to simulate the
surface granulation in a solar-type star, ignoring magnetic fields, and
investigate the importance of coherent scattering for the atmospheric
structure. A scattering term is added to the radiative transfer equation,
requiring an iterative computation of the radiation field. We use a
short-characteristics-based Gauss-Seidel acceleration scheme to compute
radiative flux divergences for the energy equation. The effects of coherent
scattering are tested by comparing the temperature stratification of three 3D
time-dependent hydrodynamical atmosphere models of a solar-type star: without
scattering, with continuum scattering only, and with both continuum and line
scattering. We show that continuum scattering does not have a significant
impact on the photospheric temperature structure for a star like the Sun.
Including scattering in line-blanketing, however, leads to a decrease of
temperatures by about 350\,K below log tau < -4. The effect is opposite to that
of 1D hydrostatic models in radiative equilibrium, where scattering reduces the
cooling effect of strong LTE lines in the higher layers of the photosphere.
Coherent line scattering also changes the temperature distribution in the high
atmosphere, where we observe stronger fluctuations compared to a treatment of
lines as true absorbers.

the stratification of different physical quantities in an optical depth scale.
However, without establishing a geometrical height scale their
three-dimensional geometrical structure can not be derived. This is crucial in
understanding the correct spatial variation of physical properties in the
penumbral atmosphere and to provide insights into the mechanism capable of
explaining the observed penumbral brightness. The aim of this work is to
determine a global geometrical height scale in the penumbra by minimizing the
divergence of the magnetic field vector and the deviations from static
equilibrium as imposed by a force balance equation that includes pressure
gradients, gravity and the Lorentz force. Optical depth models are derived from
the SIR inversion of spectropolarimetric data of an active region observed with
SOT on-board the Hinode satellite. We use a genetic algorithm to determine the
boundary condition for the inference of geometrical heights. The retrieved
geometrical height scale permits the evaluation of the Wilson depression at
each pixel and the correlation of physical quantities at each height. Our
results fit into the uncombed penumbral scenario, i.e., a penumbra composed of
flux tubes with channelled mass flow and with a weaker and more horizontal
magnetic field as compared with the background field. The ascending material is
hotter and denser than their surroundings. We do not find evidence of
overturning convection or field free regions in the inner penumbral area
analyzed. The penumbral brightness can be explained by the energy transfer of
the ascending mass carried by the Evershed flow, if the physical quantities
below z=-75km are extrapolated from the results of the inversion.

revolution, time variations of some direct observable quantities Y induced by
classical and general relativistic dynamical perturbations of the two-body
pointlike Newtonian acceleration in the case of transiting exoplanets moving
along elliptic orbits. More specifically, the observables $Y$ with which we
deal are the transit duration, the radial velocity and the time interval
between primary and secondary eclipses. The dynamical effects considered are
the centrifugal oblateness of both the star and the planet, their tidal bulges
mutually raised on each other, a distant third body X, and general relativity
(both Schwarzschild and Lense-Thirring). We take into account the effects due
to the perturbations of all the Keplerian orbital elements involved in a
consistent and uniform way. First, we explicitly compute their instantaneous
time variations due to the dynamical effects considered and plug them in the
general expression for the instantaneous change of Y; then, we take the overall
average over one orbital revolution of the so-obtained instantaneous rate $\dot
Y(t)$ specialized to the perturbations considered. Instead, somewhat hybrid
expressions can be often found in literature: in them, the secular precession
of, typically, the periastron only is straightforwardly inserted into
instantaneous formulas. Numerical evaluations of the obtained results are given
for a typical star-planet scenario and compared with the expected observational
accuracies over a time span 10 yr long. Our results are, in principle, valid
also for other astronomical scenarios. They may allow, e.g., for designing
various tests of gravitational theories with natural and artificial bodies in
our solar system. (Abridged)

know the coupling of these scalars to atomic systems. We report here on a study
of the required couplings. We give a general Lagrangian with five independent
dilaton parameters and calculate the ""dilaton charge"" of atomic systems for
each of these. Two combinations are particularly important. One is due to the
variations in the nuclear binding energy, with a sensitivity scaling with the
atomic number as $A^{-1/3}$. The other is due to electromagnetism. We compare
limits on the dilaton parameters from existing experiments.

show instead that the metastable star corresponds to a (perturbed) equilibrium
solution on the unstable branch of the equilibrium configurations. As a result,
the head-on collision of two neutron stars near the critical threshold can be
seen as a transition in the space of configurations from an initial stable
solution over to a critical metastable one which can either migrate to a stable
solution or collapse to a black hole. The critical exponent for this process
shows a fine structure which was already observed in the case of the critical
collapse of scalar fields but never before for perfect fluids.

Calculated friction coefficients of straight chains are in very good agreement

accurately calculated from the product of the collision rate and an average
momentum transfer,the latter being independent of aggregate morphology.
Langevin-dynamics simulations show that the diffusive motion of straight-chain
