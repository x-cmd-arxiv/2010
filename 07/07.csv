Gromov-Witten invariants of [C^3/Z_n], and provide extensive checks with
predictions from open string mirror symmetry. To this aim we set up a
computation of open string invariants in the spirit of Katz-Liu, defining them
by localization. The orbifold is viewed as an open chart of a global quotient
of the resolved conifold, and the Lagrangian as the fixed locus of an
appropriate anti-holomorphic involution. We consider two main applications of
the formalism. After warming up with the simpler example of [C^3/Z_3], where we
verify physical predictions of Bouchard, Klemm, Marino and Pasquetti, the main
object of our study is the richer case of [C^3/Z_4], where two different
choices are allowed for the Lagrangian. For one choice, we make numerical
checks to confirm the B-model predictions; for the other, we prove a mirror
theorem for orbifold disc invariants, match a large number of annulus
invariants, and give mirror symmetry predictions for open string invariants of
genus \leq 2.

  utility-information equivalence","22 pages, 4 figures, 1 table",,,,"cs.AI cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Classic decision-theory is based on the maximum expected utility (MEU)
principle, but crucially ignores the resource costs incurred when determining
optimal decisions. Here we propose an axiomatic framework for bounded
decision-making that considers resource costs. Agents are formalized as
probability measures over input-output streams. We postulate that any such
probability measure can be assigned a corresponding conjugate utility function
based on three axioms: utilities should be real-valued, additive and monotonic
mappings of probabilities. We show that these axioms enforce a unique
conversion law between utility and probability (and thereby, information).
Moreover, we show that this relation can be characterized as a variational
principle: given a utility function, its conjugate probability measure
maximizes a free utility functional. Transformations of probability measures
can then be formalized as a change in free utility due to the addition of new
constraints expressed by a target utility function. Accordingly, one obtains a
criterion to choose a probability measure that trades off the maximization of a
target utility function and the cost of the deviation from a reference
distribution. We show that optimal control, adaptive estimation and adaptive
control problems can be solved this way in a resource-efficient way. When
resource costs are ignored, the MEU principle is recovered. Our formalization
might thus provide a principled approach to bounded rationality that
establishes a close link to information theory.

to explain the causes of the seasons, we found a singular causality, which we

tilt of the Earth's axis- to justify a particular phenomenon -the effect: the
seasons on the Earth-, but rather made use of another phenomenon/effect, in the

exchange (spin-orbit) anisotropy are first considered, followed by an analysis
of the roles played by secondary influences, e.g. disorder, dipolar and
hyperfine fields, and magnetoacoustic interactions. Special attention is paid
to the role of the antisymmetric Dzyaloshinski-Moriya (DM) interaction. This is
done within the framework of a 12-spin microscopic model, and also using
simplified dimer and tetramer approximations in which the electronic spins are
grouped in 2 or 4 blocks, respectively. If the molecule is inversion symmetric,
the DM interaction between the dimer halves must be zero. In an inversion
symmetric tetramer, two independent DM vectors are allowed, but no new
tunneling transitions are generated by the DM interaction. Experiments on the
Mn12 wheel can only be explained if the molecular inversion symmetry is broken,
and we explore this in detail using both models, focussing on the asymmetric
disposition and rounding of Berry phase minima associated with quantum
interference between states of opposite parity. A remarkable behavior exists
for the `Berry phase zeroes' as a function of the directions of the internal DM
vectors and the external transverse field. A rather drastic breaking of the
molecular inversion-symmetry is required to explain the experiments; in the
tetramer model this requires a reorientation of the DM vectors on one half of
the molecule by nearly 180 degrees. This cannot be attributed to sample
disorder. These results are of general interest for the quantum dynamics of
tunneling spins, and lead to some interesting experimental predictions.

structure of the quark interaction. The most general two-body scalar
interaction between quarks contains the spin-flavor structures $t_1^a t_2^a,
\vec s_1\cdot \vec s_2$ and $ \vec s_1\cdot \vec s_2 t_1^a t_2^a$. We show that
in the limit of a zero range interaction all these structures are matched onto
the same hadronic mass operator $S_c^2$, which gives a possible explanation for
the dominance of this operator in the 1/Nc expansion for the L=1 states and
implies that in this limit it is impossible to distinguish between these
different spin-flavor structures. Modeling a finite range interaction through
the exchange of a vector and pseudoscalar meson, we propose a test for the
spin-flavor dependence of the quark forces. For the scalar part of the quark
interaction we find that both pion exchange and gluon exchange are compatible

quadratic term accompanies a universal linear potential term
$V(r)=\gamma_0c^2r/2$ that is associated with the cosmic background itself. We
find that when these two potential terms are taken in conjunction with the
contribution generated by the local luminous matter within the galaxies, the
conformal theory is able to account for the rotation curve systematics that is
observed in the entire 110 galaxy sample, without the need for any dark matter
whatsoever. With the two universal coefficients being found to be of global

detection of areas of the solar atmosphere that support spatially extended
oscillations. The algorithm identifies areas in the solar atmosphere whose
oscillation content is described by a single, dominant oscillation within a
user-defined frequency range. The method is based on Bayesian spectral analysis
of time-series and image filtering. A Bayesian approach sidesteps the need for
an a-priori noise estimate to calculate rejection criteria for the observed
signal, and it also provides estimates of oscillation frequency, amplitude and
noise, and the error in all these quantities, in a self-consistent way. The
algorithm also introduces the notion of quality measures to those regions for
which a positive detection is claimed, allowing simple post-detection
discrimination by the user. The algorithm is demonstrated on two Transition

relation of the concentrations of the heavier elements on the surface of the
star to the helium concentration and the magnetic field orientation. Doppler
images have been created using programs described in earlier papers by Rice and
others. An alternative surface abundance mapping code has been used to model
the helium line variations after our Doppler imaging of certain individual
helium lines produced mediocre results. We confirm the long-known existence of
helium-rich and helium-poor hemispheres on a Cen and we measure a difference of
more than two orders of magnitude in helium abundance from one side of the star
to the other. Helium is overabundant by a factor of about 5 over much of the
helium-rich hemisphere. Of particular note is our discovery that the
helium-poor hemisphere has a very high abundance of helium-3, approximately
equal to the helium-4 abundance. a Cen is therefore a new member of the small
group of helium-3 stars and the first well-established magnetic member of the
class. For the three metals investigated here, there are two strong
concentrations of abundance near the equator consistent with the positive
magnetic maximum and two somewhat weaker concentrations of abundance where the
helium concentration is centered and roughly where the negative peak of the
magnetic field would be found. Another strong concentration is found near the
equator and this is not explainable in terms of any simple symmetry with the

972 GHz N = 1 - 0 transition of OH+ and the 1115 GHz 1(11) - 0(00) transition
of ortho-H2O+. The resultant spectra show absorption by ortho-H2O+, and strong
absorption by OH+, in foreground material at velocities in the range 0 to 70
km/s with respect to the local standard of rest. The inferred OH+/H2O+
abundance ratio ranges from ~ 3 to ~ 15, implying that the observed OH+ arises
in clouds of small molecular fraction, in the 2 - 8% range. This conclusion is
confirmed by the distribution of OH+ and H2O+ in Doppler velocity space, which
is similar to that of atomic hydrogen, as observed by means of 21 cm absorption
measurements, and dissimilar from that typical of other molecular tracers. The
observed OH+/H abundance ratio of a few E-8 suggests a cosmic ray ionization

the low momentum, possibly critical, region up to the perturbative, high

contributions of modes of all wavelengths to the thermodynamical functions, as
well as for the effects of the mixing of quasiparticles with multi-particle

those of the so-called Local Potential Approximation, and we find extremely
small corrections. This result points to the robustness of the quasiparticle
picture in this system. It also demonstrates the stability of the overall
approximation scheme, and this up to the largest values of the coupling
constant that can be used in a scalar theory in 3+1 dimensions. This is in
sharp contrast to perturbation theory which shows no sign of convergence, up to

quasisymmetric Schur functions as examples, and give rise to a new poset
$\mathcal{L}_C$ that is analogous to Young's lattice. We also introduce a new
basis for the Hopf algebra of noncommutative symmetric functions $NSym$. This
basis of $NSym$ is dual to the basis of quasisymmetric Schur functions and its
elements are the pre-image of the Schur functions under the forgetful map
$\chi: NSym \rightarrow Sym$. We prove that the multiplicative structure
constants of the noncommutative Schur functions, equivalently the coefficients
of the skew quasisymmetric Schur functions when expanded in the quasisymmetric
Schur basis, are nonnegative integers, satisfying a Littlewood-Richardson rule
analogue that reduces to the classical Littlewood-Richardson rule under $\chi$.
  As an application we show that the morphism of algebras from the algebra of
Poirier-Reutenauer to $Sym$ factors through $NSym$. We also extend the
definition of Schur functions in noncommuting variables of Rosas-Sagan in the
algebra $NCSym$ to define quasisymmetric Schur functions in the algebra
$NCQSym$. We prove these latter functions refine the former and their
properties, and project onto quasisymmetric Schur functions under the forgetful
map. Lastly, we show that by suitably labeling $\mathcal{L}_C$, skew
quasisymmetric Schur functions arise in the theory of Pieri operators on
posets.

  Information Theory on April 14, 2010. Draft 2",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A family of equivalence tools for bounding network capacities is introduced.
Part I treats networks of point-to-point channels. The main result is roughly
as follows. Given a network of noisy, independent, memoryless point-to-point
channels, a collection of communication demands can be met on the given network
if and only if it can be met on another network where each noisy channel is
replaced by a noiseless bit pipe with throughput equal to the noisy channel
capacity. This result was known previously for the case of a single-source
multicast demand. The result given here treats general demands -- including,
for example, multiple unicast demands -- and applies even when the achievable
rate region for the corresponding demands is unknown in the noiseless network.
In part II, definitions of upper and lower bounding channel models for general
channels are introduced. By these definitions, a collection of communication
demands can be met on a network of independent channels if it can be met on a
network where each channel is replaced by its lower bounding model andonly if
it can be met on a network where each channel is replaced by its upper bounding
model. This work derives general conditions under which a network of noiseless
bit pipes is an upper or lower bounding model for a multiterminal channel.
Example upper and lower bounding models for broadcast, multiple access, and
interference channels are given. It is then shown that bounding the difference
between the upper and lower bounding models for a given channel yields bounds
on the accuracy of network capacity bounds derived using those models. By
bounding the capacity of a network of independent noisy channels by the network
coding capacity of a network of noiseless bit pipes, this approach represents
one step towards the goal of building computational tools for bounding network
capacities.

donors without strongly degenerate cores (and hence without a clear

considering CE events involving 10 solar mass donors on or before their red

larger than the star's He-core mass. Applied across a population of such

from decay. Although its realization does not require supersymmetry, it is
particularly appealing in the supersymmetry as an alternative to the popular
R-parity. We discuss the issues in gauging B3, and present the minimal
supersymmetric model with B3 as the remnant discrete symmetry of a TeV scale
U(1) gauge symmetry. A flavor-dependent U(1) charge is necessary to achieve
this, and it results in very distinguishable and flavorful predictions for the
LHC experiments. We find a complementarity between a 2-lepton sneutrino
resonance and a 4-lepton Z' resonance in the supersymmetry search. In addition,
we introduce baryon tetrality (B4), which would play an equivalent role if
there are four fermion generations.

levels on the upper branch of the resonance where the atomic interaction is

positive, three fully polarized fermions are energetically stable against a
single spin-flip, indicating the possibility of itinerant ferromagnetism, as
inferred in the recent experiment. We also investigate the high-temperature

Models for the origin of GASS fall generally into scenarios where it is either
a part (e.g., warp) of the Galactic disk or it represents tidal debris from the
disruption of a Milky Way (MW) satellite galaxy. To further constrain models
for the origin of GASS, we derive chemical abundance patterns from high
resolution spectra for 21 M giants spatially and kinematically identified with
it. The abundances of the (mostly) $\alpha$ element titanium and s-process
elements yttrium and lanthanum for these GASS stars are found to be lower at

Sagittarius stream, other dwarf spheroidal galaxies, and the Large Magellanic

typical of dwarf galaxies --- and unlike those of typical MW stars (at least MW
stars near the Sun). Nevertheless, these abundance results cannot definitively
rule out the possibility that GASS was dynamically created out of a previously
formed, outer MW disk because $\Lambda$CDM-based structure formation models
show that galactic disks grow outward by accretion of dwarf galaxies. On the

verification that accretion of dwarf galaxies has indeed happened at the edge

dense gas in order to form stars. On dust grains, H2 O is an important
constituent of the icy mantle in which a complex chemistry is taking place, as
revealed by hot core observations. The formation of water can occur on dust
grain surfaces, and can impact gas phase composition. Aims. The formation of
molecules such as OH, H2 O, HO2, H2 O2, as well as their deuterated forms and
O2 and O3 is studied in order to assess how the chemistry varies in different
astrophysical environments, and how the gas phase is affected by grain surface
chemistry. Methods. We use Monte Carlo simulations to follow the formation of
molecules on bare grains as well as the fraction of molecules released into the
gas phase. We consider a surface reaction network, based on gas phase
reactions, as well as UV photo-dissociation of the chemical species. Results.
We show that grain surface chemistry has a strong impact on gas phase
chemistry, and that this chemistry is very different for different dust grain
temperatures. Low temperatures favor hydrogenation, while higher temperatures
favor oxygenation. Also, UV photons dissociate the molecules on the surface,
that can reform subsequently. The formation-destruction cycle increases the
amount of species released into the gas phase. We also determine the time
scales to form ices in diffuse and dense clouds, and show that ices are formed
only in shielded environments, as supported by observations.

when the system becomes rigid. Our results establishes the atomic-scale
foundations of the phenomelogical rigidity theory, thereby profoundly extending
its significance and impact on the structural description of network glasses.

L483 (IRAS~18140$-$0440). This is a candidate source of the newly found
carbon-chain rich environment called ""Warm-Carbon-Chain-Chemistry (WCCC)"",
according to the previous observations of carbon-chain molecules. The CCS
distribution in L483 is found to consist of two clumps aligned in the
northwest-southeast direction, well tracing the CCS ridge observed with the
single-dish radio telescope. The most remarkable feature is that CCS is
depleted at the core center. Such a CCS distribution with the central hole is
consistent with those of previously observed prestellar and protostellar cores,
but it is rather unexpected for L483. This is because the distribution of CS,
which is usually similar to that of CCS, is centrally peaked. Our results imply
that the CCS ($J_{N}$=2$_{1}-$1$_{0}$) line would selectively trace the outer
cold envelope in the chemically less evolved phase that is seriously resolved
out with the interferometric observation. Thus, it is most likely that the high
abundance of CCS in L483 relative to the other WCCC sources is not due to the
activity of the protostar, although it would be related to its younger chemical
evolutionary stage, or a short timescale of the prestellar phase.

of evolving star clusters, based on the principles of stellar evolution and
cluster dynamics and on a grid of N-body simulations of cluster models. The
cluster models have different initial masses, different orbits, including
elliptical ones, and different initial density profiles. We use two sets of
cluster models: initially Roche-lobe filling and Roche-lobe underfilling. We
identify four distinct mass loss effects: (1) mass loss by stellar evolution,
(2) loss of stars induced by stellar evolution and (3) relaxation-driven mass
loss before and (4) after core collapse. Both the evolution-induced loss of
stars and the relaxation-driven mass loss need time to build up. This is
described by a delay-function of a few crossing times for Roche-lobe filling
clusters and a few half mass relaxation times for Roche-lobe underfilling
clusters. The relaxation-driven mass loss can be described by a simple power
law dependence of the mass dM/dt =-M^{1-gamma}/t0, (with M in Msun) where t0
depends on the orbit and environment of the cluster. Gamma is 0.65 for clusters
with a King-parameter W0=5 and 0.80 for more concentrated clusters with W0=7.
For initially Roche-lobe underfilling clusters the dissolution is described by
the same gamma=0.80. The values of the constant t0 are described by simple
formulae that depend on the orbit of the cluster. The mass loss rate increases
by about a factor two at core collapse and the mass dependence of the
relaxation-driven mass loss changes to gamma=0.70 after core collapse. We also
present a simple recipe for predicting the mass evolution of individual star
clusters with various metallicities and in different environments, with an
accuracy of a few percent in most cases. This can be used to predict the mass
evolution of cluster systems.

interpreting these waves as the kink mode from magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wave
theory, they should exhibit a frequency dependent damping length due to
resonant absorption, governed by the TGV relation showing that transversal
plasma inhomogeneity in coronal magnetic flux tubes causes them to act as
natural low-pass filters. It is found that observed frequency dependence on
damping length (up to about 8 mHz) can be explained by the kink wave
interpretation and furthermore, the spatially averaged equilibrium parameter
describing the length scale of transverse plasma density inhomogeneity over a

a half of marginal distributions are essentially different. For the case when
the correlation coefficient is greater than 0.5 this test is more powerful if

present work, we show that to get a conclusion of linear instability of the HP

traditional 'normal' form of disturbances which assumes an opportunity of
separation of variables describing disturbances variability depending on radial
and longitudinal (along the pipe axis) coordinates. In the result of the
absence of such variables separation, in the suggested linear theory, it is
proposed to use Bubnov-Galerkin's approximation method modification that gives
an opportunity to account longitudinal variability periods distinctions for
different radial modes defined a priori in the result of standard
Galerkin-Cantorovich's method to the equation of evolution of extremely small
axially symmetric velocity field tangential component disturbances. We found
that when considering even two linearly interacting radial modes for the HP
flow, linear instability is possible only when there exists mentioned above
conditionally periodic longitudinal along the pipe axis disturbance variability
when Re_th(p) very sensitively depends on the ratio p of two longitudinal
periods each of which describes longitudinal variability for its own radial
mode only. Obtained for the HP flow linear instability realization minimal
value Re_th=448 (when p=1.527) quantitatively agrees with the Tolmin-Shlihting

electron-phonon systems. Numerical NEGF calculations are then performed for a
model electron-phonon coupled system in order to validate our analytical
approach. We show that the conductance for the off-resonant transport regime is
adequately described by Landauer-like approach in the small-bias limit, while
for the resonant regime the Landauer-like approach results depart from the
exact results even at small finite bias. The validity of applying a
Landauer-like approach to inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy is also

for the lack of pulsations is that they form only on neutron stars accreting

system of pairwise commuting, self-adjoint left-invariant differential
operators L_1,...,L_n on a connected Lie group G. Under the assumption that the

notion due to ter Elst and Robinson (J. Funct. Anal., 157(1):88--163, 1998),
including positive elliptic operators, sublaplacians and Rockland operators -
we prove that L_1,...,L_n are (essentially) self-adjoint and strongly commuting
on L^2(G). Moreover, we perform an abstract study of such a system of
operators, in connection with the algebraic structure and the representation
theory of G, similarly as what is done in the literature for the algebras of
differential operators associated with Gelfand pairs. When G has polynomial
volume growth, weighted L^1 estimates are obtained for the convolution kernel
of the operator m(L_1,...,L_n) corresponding to a compactly supported
multiplier m satisfying some smoothness condition. The order of smoothness
which we require on m is related to the degree of polynomial growth of G. In
the case G is a homogeneous Lie group and L_1,...,L_n are homogeneous
operators, an L^p multiplier theorem of Mihlin-H\""ormander type is proved,
extending known results for a single Rockland operator. Further, a product
theory is developed, by considering several homogeneous groups G_j, each of
which with its own system of operators, and a multiplier theorem of
Marcinkiewicz type is proved, not only on the direct product of the G_j, but
also on other (possibly non-homogeneous) groups, containing homomorphic images
of the G_j. Consequently, for certain non-nilpotent groups of polynomial growth
and for some distinguished sublaplacians, we are able to improve the general
result of Alexopoulos (Proc. Amer. Math. Soc., 120(3):973-979, 1994).

these pulsars have swept across 1--200 AU over the course of our experiment,
allowing us to probe the existence and properties of the tiny scale atomic
structure (TSAS) in the cold neutral medium (CNM). While most of the observed
pulsars show no significant change in their HI absorption spectra, we have
identified at least two clear TSAS-induced opacity variations in the direction
of B1929+10. These observations require strong spatial inhomogeneities in
either the TSAS clouds' physical properties themselves or else in the clouds'
galactic distribution. While TSAS is occasionally detected on spatial scales
down to 10 AU, it is too rare to be characterized by a spectrum of turbulent
CNM fluctuations on scales of 10-1000 AU, as previously suggested by some work.
In the direction of B1929+10, an apparent correlation between TSAS and
interstellar clouds inside the warm Local Bubble (LB) indicates that TSAS may
be tracing the fragmentation of the LB wall via hydrodynamic instabilities.
While similar fragmentation events occur frequently throughout the ISM, the
warm medium surrounding these cold cloudlets induces a natural selection effect
wherein small TSAS clouds evaporate quickly and are rare, while large clouds
survive longer and become a general property of the ISM.

type indicates that the magnetic activity is one cause, but not the only one,
for the period variation. It is discovered that cyclic period changes, likely
due to the presence of a third body are more frequent in EW-type binaries among
close binaries. Therefore, the most plausible explanation of the cyclical
period changes is the LTTE via the presence of a third body. By using the
century-long historical record of the times of light minimum, we analyzed the
cyclical period change in the Algol binary WW Dra. It is found that the orbital
period of the binary shows a $\sim112.2 \textbf{\textrm{yr}}$ cyclic variation
with an amplitude of $\sim0.1977\textbf{\textrm{days}}$. The cyclic oscillation
can be attributed to the LTTE via a third body with a mass no less than $6.43
M_{\odot}$. However, no spectral lines of the third body were discovered
indicating that it may be a candidate black hole. The third body is orbiting
the binary at a distance shorter than 14.4 AU and it may play an important role
in the evolution of this system.

improvement in the cubic to tetragonal transition temperature and c/a parameter

nearby late-type stars are used to derive accurate radial velocities that are
combined with the precise Hipparcos parallaxes and proper motions to compute
galactic-spatial velocity components. Stars are classified as possible members
of the classical moving groups according to their kinematics. The spectra are
also used to study several age-related properties for young late-type stars,

splitting of the electron spectrum. The ballistic region is attached to the

the difference in populations of electrons coming from different leads.
Combined effect of the boundary scattering and spin precession leads to
oscillations of the edge polarization with the envelope function decaying as a
power law of the distance from the boundary. The problem is solved with the use
of scattering states. The simplicity of the method allows to gain an insight
into the underlaying physics. We clarify the role of the unitarity of
scattering for the problem of edge spin accumulation. In case of a straight
boundary it leads to exact cancellation of all long-wave oscillations of the
spin density. As a result, only the Friedel-like spin density oscillations with
the momentum 2k_F survive. However, this appears to be rather exceptional case.
In general, the smooth spin oscillations with the spin precession length
recover, as it happens, e.g., for the wiggly boundary. We demonstrate also,
that there is no relation between the spin current in the bulk, which is zero
in the considered case, and the edge spin accumulation.

previous study on hole spin dynamics, we explicitly include the intraband

demonstrated to be of great importance to the hole spin relaxation. The
relative contributions of the D'yakonov-Perel' and Elliott-Yafet mechanisms on
hole spin relaxation are also analyzed. In our calculation, the screening
constant, playing an important role in the hole spin relaxation, is treated
with the random phase approximation. In intrinsic GaAs, our result shows good
agreement with the experiment data at room temperature, where the hole spin
relaxation is demonstrated to be dominated by the Elliott-Yafet mechanism. We
also find that the hole spin relaxation strongly depends on the temperature and
predict a valley in the density dependence of the hole spin relaxation time at
low temperature due to the hole-electron scattering. In $p$-type GaAs, we
predict a peak in the spin relaxation time against the hole density at low
temperature, which originates from the distinct behaviors of the screening in
the degenerate and nondegenerate regimes. The competition between the screening
and the momentum exchange during scattering events can also lead to a valley in
the density dependence of the hole spin relaxation time in the low density
regime. At high temperature, the effect of the screening is suppressed due to
the small screening constant. Moreover, we predict a nonmonotonic dependence of
the hole spin relaxation time on temperature associated with the screening
together with the hole-phonon scattering. Finally, we find that the
D'yakonov-Perel' mechanism can markedly contribute to the .... (omitted due to
the limit of space)

that, given linear descriptions for each of the polyhedra to be taken in the

union of these polyhedra. In this paper, we give a generalization of this
result by extending the polyhedral structure of the variables coupling the
polyhedra taken in the union. Using this generalized concept, we derive
polynomial size linear programming formulations (compact formulations) for a
well-known spanning tree approximation of Steiner trees, for Gomory-Hu trees,
and, as a consequence, of the minimum $T$-cut problem (but not for the
associated $T$-cut polyhedron). Recently, Kaibel and Loos (2010) introduced a
more involved framework called {\em polyhedral branching systems} to derive
extended formulations. The most parts of our model can be expressed in terms of
their framework. The value of our model can be seen in the fact that it

theoretical framework for a well-controlled statistical study of
two-dimensional simulations of thermonuclear supernovae with randomized initial
conditions that can, with a particular choice of transition density, produce a
similar average and range of Ni-56 masses to those inferred from observations.
Within this framework, we utilize a more realistic ""simmered"" white dwarf
progenitor model with a flame model and energetics scheme to calculate the
amount of Ni-56 and NSE material synthesized for a suite of simulated
explosions in which the transition density is varied in the range 1-3x10^7

transition density, which is determined by the competition between plume rise
and stellar expansion. By considering the effect of metallicity on the
transition density, we find the NSE yield decreases by 0.055 +/- 0.004 solar
masses for a 1 solar metallicity increase evaluated about solar metallicity.
For the same change in metallicity, this result translates to a 0.067 +/- 0.004
solar mass decrease in the Ni-56 yield, slightly stronger than that due to the
variation in electron fraction from the initial composition. Observations
testing the dependence of the yield on metallicity remain somewhat ambiguous,
but the dependence we find is comparable to that inferred from some studies.

observations of the young pulsar PSR B2334+61 using the Nanshan radio telescope
of Urumqi Observatory. A phase-connected solution has been obtained over the
whole data span, 2002 August to 2009 August. This includes a very large glitch
that occurred between 2005 August 26 and September 8 (MJDs 53608 and 53621).
The relative increase in rotational frequency for this glitch,
$\Delta\nu_{g}/\nu~\sim~20.5\times10^{-6}$, is the largest ever seen. Although
accounting for less than 1\% of the glitch, there were two well-defined
exponential decay terms with time constants of 21 and 147 days respectively.
There was also a large long-term increase in the spindown rate with
$\Delta\dot\nu_p/\dot\nu \sim 0.011$ at the time of the glitch. A highly
significant oscillation with a period of close to one year is seen in the
post-glitch residuals. It is very unlikely that this can be accounted for by a
pulsar position error or proper motion -- it appears to result from effects
interior to the neutron star. Implications of these results for pulsar glitch
models are discussed.

are generally believed to be driven by MHD turbulence via the
magneto-rotational instability (MRI). The dynamics of solid bodies embedded in
such discs (dust grains, boulders, planetesimals and planets) may be strongly
affected by the turbulence, such that the formation pathways for planetary
systems are determined in part by the strength and spatial distribution of the
turbulent flow.
  We examine the dynamics of planetesimals, with radii between 1m \^a 10 km,
embedded in turbulent protoplanetary discs, using three dimensional MHD
simulations. The planetesimals experience gas drag and stochastic gravitational
forces due to the turbulent disc. We use, and compare the results from, local
shearing box simulations and global models in this study.
  The main aims of this work are to examine: the growth, and possible
saturation, of the velocity dispersion of embedded planetesimals as a function
of their size and disc parameters; the rate of radial migration and diffusion
of planetesimals; the conditions under which the results from shearing box and
global simulations agree.
  We find good agreement between local and global simulations when shearing
boxes of dimension 4H x 16H x 2H are used (H being the local scale height). The
magnitude of the density fluctuations obtained is sensitive to the box size,
due to the excitation and propagation of spiral density waves. This affects the
stochastic forcing experienced by planetesimals. [...]
  Our models show that fully developed MHD turbulence in protoplanetary discs
would have a destructive effect on embedded planetesimals. Relatively low
levels of turbulence are required for traditional models of planetesimal
accretion to operate, this being consistent with the existence of a dead zone
in protoplanetary discs.

star-forming galaxy depends upon star formation rate (SFR), metallicity and
stellar mass independently, using a sample of ~90,000 galaxies from Data
Release 7 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We measure extinctions
directly from the Balmer decrement of each source, and while higher values of
extinction are associated with an increase in any of the three parameters, we
demonstrate that the fundamental property that governs extinction is stellar
mass. After this mass-dependent relationship is removed, there is very little
systematic dependence of the residual extinctions with either SFR or
metallicity, and no significant improvement is obtained from a more general
parameterisation. In contrast to this, if either a SFR-dependent or
metallicity-dependent extinction relationship is applied, the residual
extinctions show significant trends that correlate with the other parameters.
Using the SDSS data, we present a relationship to predict the median dust
extinction of a sample of galaxies from its stellar mass, which has a scatter
of ~0.3 mag. The relationship was calibrated for H-alpha emission, but can be
more generally applied to radiation emitted at other wavelengths. These results
have important applications for studies of high-redshift galaxies, where
individual extinction measurements are hard to obtain but stellar mass
estimates can be relatively easily estimated from long-wavelength data.

Given a graph with n vertices, count its independent sets such that each set of

function of the lattice gas with hard-core self-repulsion and hard-core pair
interaction. We show the following conditional lower bounds: If counting the
satisfying assignments of a 3-CNF formula in n variables (#3SAT) needs time
2^{\Omega(n)} (i.e. there is a c>0 such that no algorithm can solve #3SAT in

needs time 2^{\Omega(n)} and weighted counting of independent sets needs time
2^{\Omega(n/log^3 n)} for all rational weights x\neq 0.
  We have two technical ingredients: The first is a reduction from 3SAT to
independent sets that preserves the number of solutions and increases the
instance size only by a constant factor. Second, we devise a combination of
vertex cloning and path addition. This graph transformation allows us to adapt
a recent technique by Dell, Husfeldt, and Wahlen which enables interpolation by
a family of reductions, each of which increases the instance size only
polylogarithmically.

astrophysical components for which the electromagnetic spectrum is known. In
addition MILCA corrects for the intrinsic noise bias in the standard ILC
approach and extends it to an hybrid space-frequency representation of the

of extra components but still using only a linear combination of the input
data. We apply MILCA to simulations of the Planck satellite data at the HFI
frequency bands. We explore the possibility of reconstructing the Galactic
molecular CO emission on the Planck maps as well as the thermal
Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect. We conclude that MILCA is able to accurately estimate
those emissions and it has been successfully used for this purpose within the

measuring the four Stokes profiles of spectral lines in the range from 420 to

wavelength positions in 60 s, achieving a noise level of about 2 x 10E-3 with
exposure times of 300 ms and pixel sizes of 0.17"" x 0.17"" (2 x 2 binning). The
polarization modulation is stable over periods of a few days, ensuring high

use of sophisticated data analysis techniques such as Stokes inversions. One of
the first scientific results of VIP presented here is that the ribbon-like
magnetic structures of the network are associated with a distinct pattern of
net circular polarization away from disk center. VIP performs
spectropolarimetric measurements of solar magnetic fields at a spatial
resolution that is only slightly worse than that of the Hinode

a numerical domain that contains future null infinity. We achieve this
construction using a scri-fixing conformal compactification technique based on
hyperboloidal constant mean curvature foliations of the space-time and solve
the conformally invariant wave equation. We present two results: the scalar
field shows oscillations of the quasi- normal-mode type found for black holes
only for boson star configurations that are compact, and no signs of tail decay
is found in the parameter space we explored. Even though our results do not
correspond to the master equation of perturbations of boson star solutions,
they indicate that the parameter space of boson stars as black hole mimickers
is restricted to compact configurations.

(PhCs) are designed for achieving enhanced coherent anti-Stokes Raman
scattering, which requires a cavity to have three high quality-factor (Q) modes
with equally spaced resonant frequencies. Cavities in 3D PhCs allows more
flexibility in design and tuning than their 2D slab counterparts, since
radiation loss that degrades Q can be suppressed by the 3D photonic band gap.
We first tune all the mode frequencies simultaneously by changing the material
and geometry of the cavity based on perturbation theory. Spectral spacings
between the multiple modes are adjusted according to the symmetry, volume and
field distribution of their mode profiles. The frequency and field distribution
of the resonant modes are computed by solving Maxwell's equations in the
frequency domain.

two lowest para-water transitions, and the ground transition of ionised
ortho-water in the archetypal starburst galaxy M82, performed with the HIFI
instrument on the Herschel Space Observatory. These observations are the first
detections of the para-H2O(111-000) (1113\,GHz) and ortho-H2O+(111-000)
(1115\,GHz) lines in an extragalactic source. All three water lines show
different spectral line profiles, underlining the need for high spectral
resolution in interpreting line formation processes. Using the line shape of
the para-H2O(111-000) and ortho-H2O+(111-000) absorption profile in conjunction
with high spatial resolution CO observations, we show that the (ionised) water
absorption arises from a ~2000 pc^2 region within the HIFI beam located about
~50 pc east of the dynamical centre of the galaxy. This region does not
coincide with any of the known line emission peaks that have been identified in
other molecular tracers, with the exception of HCO. Our data suggest that water
and ionised water within this region have high (up to 75%) area-covering
factors of the underlying continuum. This indicates that water is not
associated with small, dense cores within the ISM of M82 but arises from a more
widespread diffuse gas component.

show that femtosecond laser pulses can anneal individual transistors based on
In2O3 nanowires, improve the saturation of the source-drain current, and
permanently shift the threshold voltage to the positive direction. We applied
this technique and successfully shifted the switching threshold voltages of
NMOS based inverters and improved their noise margin, in both depletion and

of individual nanowire transistors, and suggests potential for large-scale
integration of nanowire-based circuit blocks and systems.

extinction ratio and bandwidth can be controlled simultaneously for purposes of

useful in dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) and radio frequency
arbitrary waveform generation (RFAWG). Multichannel filter response was
successfully tuned to match the International Telecommunication Unit (ITU) grid
with 50, 100 and 200GHz in channel spacing. Programmable channel selectivity
was demonstrated by heating the MZ arm, and continuous adjustment of
through-port extinction ratio from 0dB to 27dB was achieved. Meanwhile, the 3dB
bandwidth in the drop port changed from 0.11nm to 0.15nm due to the heating.
The device had an ultra-compact footprint (1200\mu mx100\mu m) excluding the
metal leads and contact pads, making it suitable for large scale integration.

of freedom can reside in the interior of a black hole. We suggest that this is
a consequence of the fact that the volume of any interior sphere of finite
surface area simply vanishes. Obviously, this is not the case in general
relativity. However, we show that such a phenomenon does occur in various
gravitational theories which admit a spontaneously induced general relativity.
In such theories, due to a phase transition (one parameter family degenerates)
which takes place precisely at the would have been horizon, the recovered
exterior Schwarzschild solution connects, by means of a self-similar transition
profile, with a novel 'hollow' interior exhibiting a vanishing spatial volume
and a locally varying Newton constant. This constitutes the so-called
'hollowgraphy' driven holography.

reproduces quantitatively the exact results. We then use this functional as
input for a local density approximation to the single-site entanglement of
inhomogeneous systems. We illustrate the power of this approach in a
harmonically confined system, which could simulate recent experiments with
ultracold atoms in optical lattices as well as in a superlattice and in an
impurity system. The impressive quantitative agreement with numerical
calculations -- which includes reproducing subtle signatures of the particle
density stages -- shows that our density-functional can provide entanglement
calculations for actual experiments via density measurements. Next we use our
functional to calculate the entanglement in disordered systems. We find that,
at contrast with the expectation that disorder destroys the entanglement, there
exist regimes for which the entanglement remains almost unaffected by the
presence of disordered impurities.
