verification of embedded systems. Many models have been proposed to represent
embedded systems. These models encompass a broad range of styles,
characteristics, and application domains and include the extensions of finite
state machines, data flow graphs, communication processes and Petri nets. In
this report, we have used a PRES+ model (Petri net based Representation for
Embedded Systems) as an extension of classical Petri net model that captures
concurrency, timing behaviour of embedded systems; it allows systems to be
representative in different levels of abstraction and improves expressiveness
by allowing the token to carry information. Modeling using PRES+, as discussed
above, may be convenient for specifying the input behaviour because it supports
concurrency. However, there is no equivalence checking method reported in the
literature for PRES+ models to the best of our knowledge. In contrast,
equivalence checking of FSMD models exist. As a first step, therefore, we seek
to devise an algorithm to translate PRES+ models to FSMD models.

called ""overlap"" integrals, in which the dipole matrix element is computed
using wavefunctions at different centers in the molecule, are prominent in the
first-order multielectron corrections for the velocity form, and should not be

the algebraic formulation of quantum field theory in the initial value setting.
Basing on earlier papers by one of us (AH) we approximate the Dirichlet and
Neumann boundary conditions by simple interaction models whose nonlocality in
physical space is under strict control, but which at the same time are
admissible from the point of view of algebraic restrictions imposed on models
in the context of Casimir backreaction. The geometrical setting is that of the
original parallel plates. By scaling our models and taking appropriate limit we
approach the sharp boundary conditions in the limit. The global force is
analyzed in that limit. One finds in Neumann case that although the sharp
boundary interaction is recovered in the norm resolvent sense for each model
considered, the total force per area depends substantially on its choice and
diverges in the sharp boundary conditions limit. On the other hand the local
energy density outside the interaction region, which in the limit includes any
compact set outside the strict position of the plates, has a universal limit
corresponding to sharp conditions. This is what one should expect in general,
and the lack of this discrepancy in Dirichlet case is rather accidental. Our
discussion pins down its precise origin: the difference in the order in which
scaling limit and integration over the whole space is carried out.

on 18 April 2001 suggest that the global structure of the event can be
described by the helical kink instability of a twisted magnetic flux rope. This
model is suggested by the inverse gamma shape of the source exhibiting crossing
legs of a rising flux loop and by evidence that the legs interact at or near
the crossing point. The interaction is reflected by the location of peak
brightness near the crossing point and by the formation of superimposed compact
nonthermal sources most likely at or near the crossing point. These sources
propagate upward along both legs, merge into a single, bright source at the top
of the structure, and continue to rise at a velocity $>\!1000$~km\,s$^{-1}$.
The compact sources trap accelerated electrons which radiate in the radio and
hard X-ray ranges. This suggests that they are plasmoids, although their
internal structure is not revealed by the data. They exhibit variations of the
radio brightness temperature at a characteristic time scale of $\sim\!40$~s,
anti-correlated to their area, which also support their interpretation as
plasmoids. Their propagation path differs from the standard scenario of
plasmoid formation and propagation in the flare current sheet, suggesting the
helical current sheet formed by the instability instead.

reconnection between the legs of the rope if modes with two helical turns are
dominant as a result of high initial twist in the range $\Phi\gtrsim6\pi$. Such
reconnection is complex, involving also the ambient field. In addition to
breaking up the original rope, it can form a new, low-lying, less twisted flux
rope. The new flux rope is pushed downward by the reconnection outflow, which
typically forces it to break as well by reconnecting with the ambient field.
The top part of the original rope, largely rooted in the sources of the ambient
flux after the break-up, can fully erupt or be halted at low heights, producing
a ""failed eruption."" The helical current sheet associated with the instability
is squeezed between the approaching legs, temporarily forming a double current
sheet. The leg-leg reconnection proceeds at a high rate, producing sufficiently
strong electric fields that it would be able to accelerate particles. It may
also form plasmoids, or plasmoid-like structures, which trap energetic
particles and propagate out of the reconnection region up to the top of the
erupting flux rope along the helical current sheet. The kinking of a highly
twisted flux rope involving leg-leg reconnection can explain key features of an
eruptive but partially occulted solar flare on 18 April 2001, which ejected a

receiver. We detected foreground absorption by HF toward both sources over a
wide range of velocities. Optically thin absorption components were detected on
both sight lines, allowing us to measure - as opposed to obtain a lower limit
on - the column density of HF for the first time. As in previous observations
of HF toward the source G10.6-0.4, the derived HF column density is typically
comparable to that of water vapor, even though the elemental abundance of
oxygen is greater than that of fluorine by four orders of magnitude. We used
the rather uncertain N(CH)-N(H2) relationship derived previously toward diffuse
molecular clouds to infer the molecular hydrogen column density in the clouds
exhibiting HF absorption. Within the uncertainties, we find that the abundance
of HF with respect to H2 is consistent with the theoretical prediction that HF
is the main reservoir of gas-phase fluorine for these clouds. Thus, hydrogen
fluoride has the potential to become an excellent tracer of molecular hydrogen,
and provides a sensitive probe of clouds of small H2 column density. Indeed,
the observations of hydrogen fluoride reported here reveal the presence of a
low column density diffuse molecular cloud along the W51 sight line, at an LSR
velocity of ~ 24kms-1, that had not been identified in molecular absorption
line studies prior to the launch of Herschel.

melting temperature range is prevalent, although such effect is dependent on
the size of the impurity atom relative to the cluster size. Additionally, the
difference between the atomic sizes of the impurity and the main component of
the cluster should be considered. We demonstrate that solid-solid transitions
due to migrations of the impurity become apparent and are clearly
differentiated from the melting up to cluster sizes of 147 atoms.

the elements of a given matroid are presented to an online algorithm in random
order. When an element is revealed, the algorithm learns its weight and decides
whether or not to select it under the restriction that the selected elements
form an independent set in the matroid. The objective is to maximize the total
weight of the chosen elements. In the most studied version of this problem, the
algorithm has no information about the weights beforehand. We refer to this as
the zero information model. In this paper we study a different model, also
proposed by Babaioff et al., in which the relative order of the weights is
random in the matroid. To be precise, in the random assignment model, an
adversary selects a collection of weights that are randomly assigned to the
elements of the matroid. Later, the elements are revealed to the algorithm in a
random order independent of the assignment.
  Our main result is the first constant competitive algorithm for the matroid
secretary problem in the random assignment model. This solves an open question
of Babaioff et al. Our algorithm achieves a competitive ratio of $2e^2/(e-1)$.
It exploits the notion of principal partition of a matroid, its decomposition
into uniformly dense minors, and a $2e$-competitive algorithm for uniformly
dense matroids we also develop. As additional results, we present simple
constant competitive algorithms in the zero information model for various
classes of matroids including cographic, low density and the case when every
element is in a small cocircuit. In the same model, we also give a
$ke$-competitive algorithm for $k$-column sparse linear matroids, and a new
$O(\log r)$-competitive algorithm for general matroids of rank $r$ which only
uses the relative order of the weights seen and not their numerical value, as
previously needed.

bond-orientational and compositional order increase with contact number for
hyperstatic packings. In addition, we calculate the static shear modulus and
normal mode frequencies of the static packings to understand the extent to

planets by studying near infrared emission spectra originating in the
protoplanetary disks around T Tauri stars. Our idea is to investigate whether a
massive planet could induce any observable effect on the spectral lines
emerging in the disks atmosphere. As a tracer molecule we propose CO, which is
excited in the ro-vibrational fundamental band in the disk atmosphere to a
distance of ~2-3 AU (depending on the stellar mass) where terrestrial planets
are thought to form. The synthetic molecular spectral line profiles were
calculated by an own developed semi-analytical double layer disk model. 2D gas
dynamics were incorporated in the calculation of synthetic spectral lines. We
demonstrate that a massive planet embedded in a protoplanetary disk strongly
influences the originally circular Keplerian gas dynamics. The perturbed motion
of the gas can be detected by comparing the CO line profiles in emission, which
is emerge from planet-bearing to those of planet-free disk models. The planet
signal has two major characteristics: a permanent line profile asymmetry, and
short timescale variability correlated with the orbital phase of the giant
planet. We have found that the strength of the asymmetry depends on the
physical parameters of the star-planet-disk system, such as the disk
inclination angle, the planetary and stellar masses, the orbital distance, and
the size of the disk inner cavity. The permanent line profile asymmetry is
caused by a disk in an eccentric state in the gap opened by the giant planet.
However, the variable component is a consequence of the local dynamical
perturbation by the orbiting giant planet. We show that a forming giant planet,
still embedded in the protoplanetary disk, can be detected using contemporary
or future high-resolution near-IR spectrographs like VLT/CRIRES and ELT/METIS.

n items of size > 1/4 have to be packed in a minimum number of bins of capacity
one. The famous Karmarkar-Karp algorithm transforms a fractional solution of a
suitable LP relaxation for this problem into an integral solution that requires
at most O(log n) additional bins.
  The three-permutations-problem of Beck is the following. Given any 3
permutations on n symbols, color the symbols red and blue, such that in any
interval of any of those permutations, the number of red and blue symbols is
roughly the same. The necessary difference is called the discrepancy.
  We establish a surprising connection between bin packing and Beck's problem:
The additive integrality gap of the 3-partition linear programming relaxation
can be bounded by the discrepancy of 3 permutations.
  Reversely, making use of a recent example of 3 permutations, for which a
discrepancy of Omega(log n) is necessary, we prove the following: The O(log^2

unprecedented sensitivity, as well as continuous spectral coverage across the
gaps imposed by the atmosphere, opening up a largely unexplored wavelength
regime to high-resolution spectroscopy. We show the spectrum of Orion KL
between 480 and 560 GHz and from 1.06 to 1.115 THz. From these data, we confirm
that HIFI separately measures the dust continuum and spectrally resolves
emission lines in Orion KL. Based on this capability we demonstrate that the
line contribution to the broad-band continuum in this molecule-rich source is
~20-40% below 1 THz and declines to a few percent at higher frequencies. We
also tentatively identify multiple transitions of HD18O in the spectra. The
first detection of this rare isotopologue in the interstellar medium suggests
that HDO emission is optically thick in the Orion hot core with HDO/H2O ~ 0.02.
We discuss the implications of this detection for the water D/H ratio in hot

However, it has been proposed that both SGRBs and long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs)
may, on rare occasions, form an unstable millisecond pulsar (magnetar) prior to
final collapse. GRB 090515, detected by the Swift satellite was extremely
short, with a T_90 of 0.036 +/- 0.016 s, and had a very low fluence of 2 x
10^-8 erg cm^-2 and faint optical afterglow. Despite this, the 0.3 - 10 keV
flux in the first 200 s was the highest observed for a SGRB by the Swift X-ray
Telescope (XRT). The X-ray light curve showed an unusual plateau and steep
decay, becoming undetectable after ~500 s. This behaviour is similar to that
observed in some long bursts proposed to have magnetars contributing to their
emission. In this paper, we present the Swift observations of GRB 090515 and
compare it to other gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) in the Swift sample. Additionally,
we present optical observations from Gemini, which detected an afterglow of

effective $O(4)$-symmetric nonlinear $\sigma$-model in $D=2+1$ for the case of

perturbations. If dark energy is not completely homogeneous on observable
scales then the Poisson equation is modified and dark matter clustering is
directly affected. One can then search for observational effects of dark energy
clustering using dark matter as a probe. In this paper we exploit an analytical
approximate solution of the perturbation equations in a general dark energy

constraining equation of state and sound speed. We find that tomographic weak
lensing and galaxy redshift surveys can constrain the sound speed of the dark
energy only if the latter is small, of the order of $c_{s}\lesssim0.01$ (in
units of $c$). For larger sound speeds the error grows to 100% and more. We
conclude that large scale structure observations contain very little

accretion-related states that are not observed in any other stellar-mass black
hole system. One of these states, however -- referred to as the plateau state
-- may be related to the canonical hard state of black hole X-ray binaries.
Both the plateau and hard state are associated with steady, relatively lower
X-ray emission and flat/inverted radio emission, that is sometimes resolved
into compact, self-absorbed jets. However, while generally black hole binaries
quench their jets when the luminosity becomes too high, GRS1915+105 seems to
sustain them despite the fact that it accretes at near- or super-Eddington
rates. In order to investigate the relationship between the plateau and the
hard state, we fit two multi-wavelength observations using a steady-state
outflow-dominated model, developed for hard state black hole binaries. The data
sets consist of quasi-simultaneous observations in radio, near-infrared and
X-ray bands. Interestingly, we find both significant differences between the
two plateau states, as well as between the best-fit model parameters and those
representative of the hard state. We discuss our interpretation of these
results, and the possible implications for GRS 1915+105's relationship to
canonical black hole candidates.

spectrograph on the NASA Infrared Telescope facility to characterize the
stellar content of Barnard 59 (B59), the most active star-forming core in the
Pipe Nebula. Measuring luminosity and temperature sensitive features in the
spectra of 20 candidate YSOs, we identified likely background giant stars and
measured each star's spectral type, extinction, and NIR continuum excess. We
find that B59 is composed of late type (K4-M6) low-mass (0.9--0.1 M_sun) YSOs
whose median stellar age is comparable to, if not slightly older than, that of
YSOs within the Rho Oph, Taurus, and Chameleon star forming regions. Deriving
absolute age estimates from pre-main sequence models computed by D'Antona et
al., and accounting only for statistical uncertainties, we measure B59's median
stellar age to be 2.6+/-0.8 Myrs. Including potential systematic effects
increases the error budget for B59's median (DM98) stellar age to 2.6+4.1/-2.6
Myrs. We also find that the relative age orderings implied by pre-main sequence
evolutionary tracks depend on the range of stellar masses sampled, as model
isochrones possess significantly different mass dependencies. The maximum
likelihood median stellar age we measure for B59, and the region's observed gas
properties, suggest that the B59 dense core has been stable against global
collapse for roughly 6 dynamical timescales, and is actively forming stars with
a star formation efficiency per dynamical time of ~6%. This maximum likelihood
value agrees well with recent star formation simulations that incorporate
various forms of support against collapse, such as sub-critical magnetic
fields, outflows, and radiative feedback from protostellar heating. [abridged]

dynamical friction force which drag it into the halo center and finally it
merger with the central galaxy. The time interval between entry and merger is
called as the dynamical friction timescale (T_df). Many studies have been
dedicated to derive T_df using analytical models or N-body simulations. These
studies have obtained qualitative agreements on how T_df depends on the orbit
parameters, and mass ratio between satellite and host halo. However, there are
still disagreements on the accurate form of T_df . In this paper, we present a

from satellite by tidal stripping dominates the behavior of T_df . We also
identify other model parameters which affect the predicted T_df.

relatively homogeneous, with elliptical/disky brightest cluster galaxies
(BCGs), cuspy gas density profiles (i.e. strong cool cores), high

gap clusters are heterogeneous, spanning the full range of
boxy/elliptical/disky BCG morphologies, the full range of cool core strengths

together, these results imply that the amplitude of the luminosity gap is a

investigating the water chemistry in young stellar objects (YSOs) during
protostellar evolution. Hydroxyl (OH) is one of the reactants in the chemical
network most closely linked to the formation and destruction of H2O.
High-temperature chemistry connects OH and H2O through the OH + H2 <-> H2O + H
reactions. Formation of H2O from OH is efficient in the high-temperature regime
found in shocks and the innermost part of protostellar envelopes. Moreover, in
the presence of UV photons, OH can be produced from the photo-dissociation of
H2O. High-resolution spectroscopy of the OH 163.12 micron triplet towards HH 46
and NGC 1333 IRAS 2A was carried out with the Heterodyne Instrument for the Far
Infrared (HIFI) on board Herschel. The low- and intermediate-mass YSOs HH 46,
TMR 1, IRAS 15398-3359, DK Cha, NGC 7129 FIRS 2, and NGC 1333 IRAS 2A were
observed with the Photodetector Array Camera and Spectrometer (PACS) in four
transitions of OH and two [OI] lines. The OH transitions at 79, 84, 119, and
163 micron and [OI] emission at 63 and 145 micron were detected with PACS
towards the class I low-mass YSOs as well as the intermediate-mass and class I
Herbig Ae sources. No OH emission was detected from the class 0 YSO NGC 1333
IRAS 2A, though the 119 micron was detected in absorption. With HIFI, the
163.12 micron was not detected from HH 46 and only tentatively detected from
NGC 1333 IRAS 2A. The combination of the PACS and HIFI results for HH 46
constrains the line width (FWHM > 11 km/s) and indicates that the OH emission
likely originates from shocked gas. This scenario is supported by trends of the
OH flux increasing with the [OI] flux and the bolometric luminosity. Similar OH
line ratios for most sources suggest that OH has comparable excitation
temperatures despite the different physical properties of the sources.

radioactivity and thus the physics of weak interactions, well before atomic and
quantum physics was known. The different types of radioactive decay, alpha,
beta, and gamma decay, all are different types of interactions causing the
same, spontaneous, and time-independent decay of an unstable nucleus into
another and more stable nucleus. Nuclear reactions in cosmic sites re-arrange
the basic constituents of atomic nuclei (neutrons and protons) among the
different configurations which are allowed by Nature, thus producing
radioactive isotopes as a by-product. Throughout cosmic history, such reactions
occur in different sites, and lead to rearrangements of the relative abundances
of cosmic nuclei, a process called cosmic chemical evolution, which can be
studied through the observations of radioactivity. The special role of
radioactivity in such studies is contributed by the intrinsic decay of such
material after it has been produced in cosmic sites. This brings in a new
aspect, the clock of the radioactive decay. Observational studies of cosmic
radioactivities intrinsically obtain isotopic information which are at the
heart of cosmic nucleosynthesis. They are best performed by precision mass
spectroscopy in terrestrial laboratories, which has been combined with
sophisticated radiochemistry to extract meteoritic components originating from
outside the solar system, and by spectroscopy of characteristic gamma-ray lines
emitted upon radioactive decay in cosmic environments and measured with
space-based telescopes. This book describes where and how specific astronomical
messages from cosmic radioactivity help to complement the studies of cosmic

Therefore, they are created under strict isolation conditions. In contrast, new
approaches harness the coupling of the system to the environment, which drives
the system into the desired state. Following these ideas, we present a robust
method for generating steady state entanglement between two distant atomic
ensembles. The proposed scheme relies on the interaction of the two atomic
systems with the common vacuum modes of the electromagnetic field which act as
an engineered environment. We develop the theoretical framework for two level
systems including dipole-dipole interactions and complement these results by
considering the implementation in multi-level ground states.

and their decay products will be highly collimated. In semileptonic decay
modes, this often leads to the merging of the b-jet and the hard lepton
according to standard event reconstructions, which can complicate new physics
searches. Here we explore ways of efficiently recovering this signal in the
muon channel at the LHC. We perform a particle-level study of events with muons
produced inside of boosted tops, as well as in generic QCD jets and from
W-strahlung off of hard quarks. We characterize the discriminating power of
cuts previously explored in the literature, as well two new ones. We find a
particularly powerful isolation variable which can potentially reject light QCD
jets with hard embedded muons at the 10^3 level while retaining 80~90% of the
tops. This can also be fruitfully combined with other cuts for O(1) greater
discrimination. For W-strahlung, a simple pT-scaled maximum \Delta R cut
performs comparably to a highly idealized top-mass reconstruction, rejecting an
O(1) fraction of the background with percent-scale loss of signal. Using these
results, we suggest a set of well-motivated baseline cuts for any physics
analysis involving semileptonic top quarks at TeV-scale momenta, using neither
b-tagging nor missing energy as discriminators. We demonstrate the utility of
our cuts in searching for resonances in the top-antitop invariant mass
spectrum. For example, our results suggest that 100 fb^{-1} of data from a 14
TeV LHC could be used to discover a warped KK gluon up to 4.5 TeV or higher.

dictate the dynamic transition behavior near the Andrews critical point. In

the gas-liquid co-existence curve can be extended beyond the Andrews critical
point, and 3) the liquid-gas phase transition going beyond Andrews point is of

the range 920 <= \eta <= 1070, photospheric radius r_{ph} ~ 7.2 - 8.4 * 10^{11}
cm and dissipation radius r_\gamma >= 3.5 - 4.1 * 10^{15} cm. By comparison to
afterglow data, we deduce that a large fraction, epsilon_d ~85% - 95% of the
kinetic energy is dissipated, and that large fraction, ~equipartition of this
energy is carried by the electrons and the magnetic field. This high value of
epsilon_d questions the ""internal shock"" scenario as the main energy
dissipation mechanism for this GRB.

theoretically the short term cardiovascular variability: how the
respiratory-related blood pressure fluctuations are buffered by appropriate
heart rate changes: i.e. the respiratory sinus arrhythmia. The buffering is
shown to be crucially dependent on the time delay between the stimulus (such as
e.g. the inspiration onset) and the application of the control (the moment in
time when the efferent response is delivered to the heart). This theoretical
analysis shows that the buffering mechanism is effective only in the upright
position of the body. It explains a paradoxical effect of enhancement of the
blood pressure fluctuations by an ineffective control. Such a phenomenon was
observed experimentally. Using the basis of the model, we discuss the blood
pressure variability and heart rate variability under such clinical conditions
as the states of expressed adrenergic drive and the tilt-test during the
parasympathetic blockade or fixed rate atrial pacing. From the results of the
variability analysis we draw a conclusion that the control of blood pressure in
the HF band does not directly obtain the arterial baroreceptor input. We also
discuss methodological issues of baroreflex sensitivity and sympathovagal
balance assessment.

momentum preservation, approximate energy conservation and equality constraint
preservation, but also enforce multiple simultaneous inequality constraints,
obtain smooth unilateral motion along constraint boundaries and allow for both

understand- ing the evolution of magnetic structures in the heliosphere.
Through a survey of 125 previously reported small flux ropes from 1995 to 2005,
we find that 44 of them reveal clear signatures of Alfvenic fluctuations, and
thus classify them into Alfven wave trains rather than flux ropes. Signatures
of magnetic reconnection, generally including a plasma jet of ~30 km/s within a
magnetic field rotational region, are clearly present at boundaries of about
42% of the flux ropes and 14% of the wave trains. The reconnection exhausts are
often observed to show a local increase in the proton temperature, density and
plasma beta. About 66% of the reconnection events at flux rope boundaries are
associated with a magnetic field shear angle larger than 90 deg and 73% of them
reveal a decrease by 20% or more in the magnetic field magnitude, suggesting a
dominance of anti-parallel reconnec- tion at flux rope boundaries. The
occurrence rate of magnetic reconnection at flux rope boundaries through the
year of 1995 to 2005 is also investigated and we find that it is relatively low
around solar maximum and much higher when ap- proaching solar minima. The
average magnetic field depression and shear angle for reconnection events at
flux rope boundaries also reveal a similar trend from 1995 to 2005. Our results
demonstrate for the first time that boundaries of a substantial fraction of
small-scale flux ropes have properties similar to those of magnetic clouds, in
the sense that both of them exhibit signatures of magnetic reconnection. The
observed reconnection signatures could be related either to the formation of
small flux ropes, or to the interaction between flux ropes and the
interplanetary magnetic fields.

  Garching, Germany",,,,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Shortly after the first results of Chandra and XMM-Newton appeared, many
researchers in the field abandoned the term ""cooling flow clusters"" in favor of
the name ""cool core clusters"". This change, I argue, has been causing damage by
promoting the view that there is no substantial cooling in these clusters. In
this contribution I discuss the following points, with emphasize on the last
one that deals with magnetic fields in cooling flow clusters. (1) Both
AGN-feedback and hot-gas cooling to form stars occur during galaxy formation as
well as in cooling flow clusters. Ignoring cooling of the intra-cluster medium,
as implied by the term ""cool core"", does not encourage comparative study of AGN
feedback in cooling flow clusters with that of galaxy formation. (2) The line
of thought that there is no cooling might lead to wrong questions and research
directions. (3) A key question in both cooling flow clusters and during galaxy
formation is the mode of accretion by the super massive black hole (SMBH). When
cooling is neglected only accretion from the hot phase remains. Accretion from
the hot phase, such as the Bondi accretion, suffers from some severe problems.
(4) When it is accepted that moderate quantities of gas are cooling, it becomes
clear that global heat conduction must be substantially suppressed. This does

Chern-Simons-type action in four-dimensional spacetime resulting from the
addition to the conventional QED Lagrangian of a term with a background field

out that the proportionality constant in that term depends heavily on the

Glauber dynamics for the hard-core model on the tree. The hard-core model is
defined on the set of independent sets weighted by a parameter $\lambda$,
called the activity. The Glauber dynamics is the Markov chain that updates a
randomly chosen vertex in each step. On the infinite tree with branching factor
$b$, the hard-core model can be equivalently defined as a broadcasting process
with a parameter $\omega$ which is the positive solution to
$\lambda=\omega(1+\omega)^b$, and vertices are occupied with probability
$\omega/(1+\omega)$ when their parent is unoccupied. This broadcasting process
undergoes a phase transition between the so-called reconstruction and
non-reconstruction regions at $\omega_r\approx \ln{b}/b$. Reconstruction has
been of considerable interest recently since it appears to be intimately
connected to the efficiency of local algorithms on locally tree-like graphs,
such as sparse random graphs. In this paper we show that the relaxation time of
the Glauber dynamics on regular $b$-ary trees $T_h$ of height $h$ and $n$
vertices, undergoes a phase transition around the reconstruction threshold. In
particular, we construct a boundary condition for which the relaxation time
slows down at the reconstruction threshold. More precisely, for any $\omega \le
\ln{b}/b$, for $T_h$ with any boundary condition, the relaxation time is
$\Omega(n)$ and $O(n^{1+o_b(1)})$. In contrast, above the reconstruction
threshold we show that for every $\delta>0$, for $\omega=(1+\delta)\ln{b}/b$,
the relaxation time on $T_h$ with any boundary condition is $O(n^{1+\delta +
o_b(1)})$, and we construct a boundary condition where the relaxation time is

density-density, and pair-pair correlation functions, and fit these to various
asymptotic power laws. Comparing the finite-periodic-chain and finite-openchain
correlations with their infinite-chain counterparts, we find reasonable
agreement among them for the power-law amplitudes and exponents, but poor
agreement for the phase shifts. More importantly, for chain lengths on the
order of 100, we find our finite-open-chain calculation overestimates some
infinite-chain exponents (as did a recent density-matrix renormalization-group
(DMRG) calculation on finite smooth chains), whereas our finite-periodic-chain
calculation underestimates these exponents. We attribute this systematic
difference to the different choice of boundary conditions. Eventually, both
finite-chain exponents approach the infinite-chain limit: by a chain length of
1000 for periodic chains, and > 2000 for open chains. There is, howwever, a
misleading apparent finite size scaling convergence at shorter chain lengths,
for both our finite-chain exponents, as well as the finite-smooth-chain

that the cosmological constant is positive means not that the spacetime
background is curved but that the de Sitter (dS) algebra as the symmetry
algebra is more relevant than the Poincare or anti de Sitter ones. The physical
interpretation of irreducible representations (IRs) of the dS algebra is
considerably different from that for the other two algebras. One IR of the dS
algebra splits into independent IRs for a particle and its antiparticle only
when Poincare approximation works with a high accuracy. Only in this case
additive quantum numbers such as electric, baryon and lepton charges are
conserved, while at early stages of the Universe they could not be conserved.
Another property of IRs of the dS algebra is that only fermions can be
elementary and there can be no neutral elementary particles. The cosmological
repulsion is a simple kinematical consequence of dS symmetry on quantum level
when quasiclassical approximation is valid. Therefore the cosmological constant
problem does not exist and there is no need to involve dark energy or other
fields for explaining this phenomenon (in agreement with a similar conclusion
by Bianchi and Rovelli).

lines which are diagnostic probes of the mechanisms that give rise to the
abrupt changes in star-formation rates in these galaxies. In the post-starburst
sample we are unable to detect any radial gradients in the Hdelta line
equivalent width - although one galaxy exhibits a gradient from one side of the
galaxy to the other. The absence of Hdelta gradients in these galaxies is
consistent with their production via interaction with the intra-cluster medium,
however, our limited spatial sampling prevents us from drawing robust
conclusions. All members of the sample have early type morphologies, typical of
post-starburst galaxies in general, but lack the high incidence of tidal tails
and disturbances seen in local field samples. This argues against a merger
origin and adds weight to a scenario where truncation by the intra-cluster
medium is at work. The post-starburst spectral signature is consistent over the
radial extent probed with no evidence of OII3727 emission and strong Hdelta
absorption at all radii i.e. the post-starburst classification is not an
aperture effect. In contrast the dusty-starburst sample shows a tendency for a
central concentration of OII3727 emission. This is most straightforwardly
interpreted as the consequence of a central starburst. However, other
possibilities exist such as a non-uniform dust distribution (which is expected
in such galaxies) and/or a non-uniform starburst age distribution. The sample
exhibit late type and irregular morphologies.

wherein the canonical energy-momentum dispersion relation, $E^2=p^2+m^2$, is
modified. Consequently, new phenomenons beyond the standard model are
predicted. Especially, the presence of LV highly affects the propagation of
astrophysical photons with very high energies from distant galaxies. In this
paper, we review the updating theoretical and experimental results on this
topic. We classify the effects into three categories: (i) time lags between
photons with different energies; (ii) a cutoff of photon flux above the
threshold energy of photon decay, $\gamma \rightarrow e^++e^-$; (iii) new
patterns in the spectra of multi-TeV photons and EeV photons, due to the
absorption of background lights. As we can see, the details of LV effects on
astrophysical photons depend heavily on the ""phase space"" of LV parameters.
From observational aspects, nowadays available and upcoming instruments can
study these phenomenons hopefully, and shed light onto LV issues and QG
theories. The most recent progresses and constraints on the ultra-high energy

particle floating at the surface of a sessile droplet is studied both
analytically and numerically. In the special case that the contact angle at the
substrate equals $\pi/2$ a capillary analogue of the method of images is
applied in order to calculate small deformations of the droplet shape if an
external force is applied to the particle. The type of boundary conditions for
the droplet shape at the substrate determines the sign of the capillary
monopole associated with the image particle. Therefore, the free energy of the
particle, which is proportional to the interaction energy of the original
particle with its image, can be of either sign, too. The analytic solutions,
given by the Green's function of the capillary equation, are constructed such
that the condition of the forces acting on the droplet being balanced and of
the volume constraint are fulfilled. Besides the known phenomena of attraction
of a particle to a free contact line and repulsion from a pinned one, we
observe a local free energy minimum for the particle being located at the drop
apex or at an intermediate angle, respectively. This peculiarity can be traced
back to a non-monotonic behavior of the Green's function, which reflects the
interplay between the deformations of the droplet shape and the volume
constraint.

this project is the so-called ""realistic modeling"" or the construction of the

and incorporate the physics of Coulomb correlations. It should also provide a
transparent physical picture for the low-energy properties of strongly
correlated materials. In this review article, we will outline the basic ideas
of such a realistic modeling. The entire procedure will be illustrated on the
series of examples, including the distorted transition-metal perovskite oxides,
the compounds with the inversion symmetry breaking caused by the defects, and
the alkali hyperoxide KO2, which can be regarded as an analog of
strongly-correlated systems where the localized electrons reside on the
molecular orbitals of the O2- dimer. In order to illustrate abilities of the
realistic modeling, we will also consider solutions of the obtained low-energy

tool for the exploration and understanding of properties of strongly correlated

provide abundant empirical evidence that there is a phase transition in the
growth trend of the two networks. For the IPv4 network, the phase change
occurred in 2001. Before then the network's size grew exponentially, and
thereafter it followed a linear growth. Changes are also observed around the
same time for the maximum node degree, the average node degree and the average
shortest path length. For the IPv6 network, the phase change occurred in late
2006. It is notable that the observed phase transitions in the two networks are
different, for example the size of IPv6 network initially grew linearly and
then shifted to an exponential growth. Our results show that following decades
of rapid expansion up to the beginning of this century, the IPv4 network has
now evolved into a mature, steady stage characterised by a relatively slow
growth with a stable network structure; whereas the IPv6 network, after a slow
startup process, has just taken off to a full speed growth. We also provide
insight into the possible impact of IPv6-over-IPv4 tunneling deployment scheme
on the evolution of the IPv6 network. The Internet topology generators so far
are based on an inexplicit assumption that the evolution of Internet follows
non-changing dynamic mechanisms. This assumption, however, is invalidated by
our results.Our work reveals insights into the Internet evolution and provides

predicts peculiar Higgs boson signatures of displaced vertices with two b jets
and one or two charged particles which can be cleanly identified. In a
supersymmetric theory, the scalar partner of the fermion triplet contains a
neutral dark matter candidate which is almost degenerate with its charged
components. A Higgs boson can be produced together with such a dark matter
triplet in the cascade decay chain of a strongly produced squark or gluino.
When the next lightest supersymmetric particle (NLSP) is bino/wino-like, there
appears a Higgs boson associated with two charged tracks of a charged lepton
and a heavy charged scalar at a displacement larger than about 1 mm. The
corresponding production cross-section is about 0.5 fb for the squark/gluino
mass of 1 TeV. In the case of the stau NLSP, it decays mainly to a Higgs boson
and a heavy charged scalar whose decay length is larger than 0.1 mm for the
stau NLSP mixing with the left-handed stau smaller than 0.3. As this process
can have a large cascade production $\sim 2$ pb for the squark/gluino mass
$\sim 1$ TeV, one may be able to probe it at the early stage of the LHC

states is calculated as a function of the distance from the interface. Bound
state due to both d-wave and spin density wave gaps are formed in the normal
metal for energies less than the respective gaps. If there is a mismatch
between the Fermi velocities in the two layers we observe that these states
will shift in energy when spin density wave order is present, thus inducing a
minigap at finite energy. We conclude that the STM measurement in the proximity
structures is able to distinguish between the two scenarios proposed for the

generalizing the definition of gravitational descendants from Gromov-Witten
theory to SFT, one can assign to every contact manifold a Hamiltonian system

While we have shown how the well-known string, dilaton and divisor equations
translate from Gromov-Witten theory to SFT, the next step is to show how
genus-zero topological recursion translates to SFT. Compatible with the example
of SFT of closed geodesics, it turns out that the corresponding localization
theorem requires a non-equivariant version of SFT, which is generated by
parametrized instead of unparametrized closed Reeb orbits. Since this

uncertainty is due to our poor knowledge of heavy meson wave functions. We also
comment that it is not trivial to generalize this approach to $B_s$ system,
primarily because both $\bar B_s^0 $ and $B_s^0$ can decay into the same final

Wesenheit magnitudes and the calibrated template. The method is evaluated by
ascertaining the distance moduli for the LMC (mu_0=18.43+-0.03 se) and the
globular clusters omega Cen, M54, M13, M3, and M15. The results agree with
estimates cited in the literature, although a nearer distance to M13 is
favoured (pending confirmation of the data's photometric zero-point) and
observations of variables near the core of M15 suffer from photometric
contamination. The calibrated LMC data is subsequently added to the Wesenheit

Scuti variables indicating the stars follow a steeper VI Wesenheit function

processes, in particular those aimed at constraining current and future
interferometric observations of protoplanetary disks. We consider three
physical models: a cold molecular cloud core, a hot core, and an outer region
of a T Tauri disk. Our chemical network (for both models) is based on the
original gas-phase osu_03_2008 ratefile and includes gas-grain interactions and
a set of surface reactions for the H-, O-, C-, S-, and N-bearing molecules. The
benchmarking is performed with the increasing complexity of the considered
processes: (1) the pure gas-phase chemistry, (2) the gas-phase chemistry with
accretion and desorption, and (3) the full gas-grain model with surface
reactions. Using atomic initial abundances with heavily depleted metals and
hydrogen in its molecular form, the chemical evolution is modeled within 10^9
years. The time-dependent abundances calculated with the two chemical models
are essentially the same for all considered physical cases and for all species,
including the most complex polyatomic ions and organic molecules. This result
however required a lot of efforts to make all necessary details consistent
through the model runs, e.g. definition of the gas particle density, density of
grain surface sites, the strength and shape of the UV radiation field, etc. The
reference models and the benchmark setup, along with the two chemical codes and
resulting time-dependent abundances are made publicly available in the

copyrighted) content has serious legal implications for user who publish the
material (or publishers). This raises a question that whether (at least major)

such as financial. In this study, we identify the content publishers of more

demonstrate that a small fraction of publishers are responsible for 66% of

these major publishers respond to two different profiles. On one hand,
antipiracy agencies and malicious publishers publish a large amount of fake

other hand, content publishing in BitTorrent is largely driven by companies
with financial incentive. Therefore, if these companies lose their interest or
are unable to publish content, BitTorrent traffic/portals may disappear or at

correlation with their masses. This is different from elliptical galaxies, for
which the Faber-Jackson relation suggests a strong positive correlation between
mass and radius. Objects that are somewhat in between globular clusters and
low-mass galaxies, such as ultra-compact dwarf galaxies, have a mass-radius
relation consistent with the extension of the relation for bright ellipticals.
Here we show that at an age of 10 Gyr a break in the mass-radius relation at
~10^6 Msun is established because objects below this mass, i.e. globular
clusters, have undergone expansion driven by stellar evolution and hard
binaries. From numerical simulations we find that the combined energy
production of these two effects in the core comes into balance with the flux of
energy that is conducted across the half-mass radius by relaxation. An
important property of this `balanced' evolution is that the cluster half-mass
radius is independent of its initial value and is a function of the number of
bound stars and the age only. It is therefore not possible to infer the initial
mass-radius relation of globular clusters and we can only conclude that the
present day properties are consistent with the hypothesis that all hot stellar
systems formed with the same mass-radius relation and that globular clusters
have moved away from this relation because of a Hubble time of stellar and

investigate the microscopic dynamics and mechanical responses of aqueous
solutions of triblock copolymers and aqueous mixtures of triblock copolymers
and anionic surfactants. Increasing the concentration of triblock copolymers
results in a sharp increase in the magnitude of the complex moduli
characterising the samples. This is understood in terms of the changes in the
aggregation and packing behaviours of the copolymers and the constraints
imposed upon their dynamics due to increased close packing. The addition of
suitable quantities of an anionic surfactant to a strongly elastic copolymer
solution results in a decrease in the complex moduli of the samples by several
decades. It is argued that the shape anisotropy and size polydispersity of the
micelles comprising mixtures cause dramatic changes in the packing behaviour,
resulting in sample unjamming and the observed decrease in complex moduli.
Finally, a phase diagram is constructed in the temperature-surfactant
concentration plane to summarise the jamming-unjamming behaviour of aggregates
constituting triblock copolymer-anionic surfactant mixtures.

Quasicontinuum methods utilize a strain energy density derived from the

  Several quasicontinuum methods have been proposed to couple the atomistic
model with the Cauchy-Born strain energy density. The quasi-nonlocal coupling
method is easy to implement and achieves a reasonably accurate coupling for
short range interactions. In this paper, we give a new formulation of the

olfactory information is represented by a spatially and temporally sparse code.
Each odor stimulus will activate only a small portion of neurons and each
stimulus leads to only a short phasic response following stimulus onset
irrespective of the actual duration of a constant stimulus. The mechanisms
responsible for the sparse code in the KCs are yet unresolved.
  Here, we explore the role of the neuron-intrinsic mechanism of
spike-frequency adaptation (SFA) in producing temporally sparse responses to
sensory stimulation in higher processing stages. Our single neuron model is
defined through a conductance-based integrate-and-fire neuron with
spike-frequency adaptation [1]. We study a fully connected feed-forward network
architecture in coarse analogy to the insect olfactory pathway. A first layer
of ten neurons represents the projection neurons (PNs) of the antenna lobe. All
PNs receive a step-like input from the olfactory receptor neurons, which was
realized by independent Poisson processes. The second layer represents 100 KCs
which converge onto ten neurons in the output layer which represents the
population of mushroom body extrinsic neurons (ENs).
  Our simulation result matches with the experimental observations. In
particular, intracellular recordings of PNs show a clear phasic-tonic response
that outlasts the stimulus [2] while extracellular recordings from KCs in the
locust express sharp transient responses [3]. We conclude that the
neuron-intrinsic mechanism is can explain a progressive temporal response
sparsening in the insect olfactory system. Further experimental work is needed
to test this hypothesis empirically.

fixed sparse signal can be recovered with a random draw of the matrix using
$\ell_1$-minimization. The constant 2 in the condition is optimal, and the
proof is rather short compared to a similar result due to Donoho and Tanner.

understand the interactions between partons and the produced hot nuclear
matter. Measurements in p+p collisions provide information about how the heavy
quarks are produced and fragment and in d+Au collisions are sensitive to
possible effects from cold nuclear matter. Azimuthal correlation measurements
involving heavy flavor probes are complementary to single particle spectra
measurements and provide additional information about production and
interactions of heavy quarks. Measurements of electrons with heavy flavor decay
with other hadrons from the event can provide information about how the heavy
quark interacts with the produced matter and can be compared to similar
measurements from light hadron correlations. Correlations between electrons
from heavy flavor decay with muons, also from heavy flavor decay, can provide
further information about heavy flavor production and cold nuclear matter
effects in d+Au collisions with a very clean signal. We present PHENIX results
for electron-hadron correlations in p+p and Au+Au collisions and electron-muon
correlations in p+p and d+Au collisions and discuss the implications of these
measurements.

provide sufficient data for future conjectures on the higher-loop form of the
structure constants possibly involving integrability. For this we have computed
a sample of 70 structure constants at one-loop order involving primary
operators of up to and including length five built entirely from scalar fields.
We observe in all 17 cases occurring in our sample that the one-loop structure
constant of two protected chiral primary operators and one unprotected operator
is given by a simple linear function involving the anomalous scaling dimension
of the latter. Moreover, a similar simple one-loop formula is proven for the
three-point structure constants of the Konishi operator and two arbitrary
protected or un-protected operators. It is again determined by the anomalous
scaling dimensions of the operators involved.

faint X-ray point source (CXOUJ182913.1-125113) and an associated diffuse
nebula in the composite supernova remnant G18.95-1.1. These objects appear to
be the long-sought pulsar and its wind nebula. The X-ray spectrum of the point
source is best described by an absorbed powerlaw model with Gamma=1.6 and an
N_H of ~1x10^(22) cm^(-2). This model predicts a relatively low unabsorbed
X-ray luminosity of about L_X (0.5-8.0keV) = 4.1x10^(31)D_2^2 erg s^(-1), where
D_2 is the distance in units of 2kpc. The best-fitted model of the diffuse
nebula is a combination of thermal (kT = 0.48keV) and non-thermal (1.4 < Gamma
< 1.9) emission. The unabsorbed X-ray luminosity of L_X = 5.4x10^(33)D_2^2 erg
s^(-1) in the 0.5-8keV energy band seems to be largely dominated by the thermal
component from the SNR, providing 87% of L_X in this band. No radio or X-ray
pulsations have been reported for CXOUJ182913.1-125113. If we assume an age of
~5300yr for G18.95-1.1 and use the X-ray luminosity for the pulsar and the wind
nebula together with the relationship between spin-down luminosity (via
magnetic dipole radiation) and period, we estimate the pulsar's period to be P
= 0.4s. Compared to other rotation-powered pulsars, a magnetic field of
2.2x10^(13)G is implied by its location in the P-Pdot diagram, a value which is
close to that of the quantum critical field.

stellar objects. Broad band CCD images were obtained over three months at
one-to-two week intervals for the field of NGC 6726, using the large
field-of-view remotely-operated telescope on top of Cerro Burek. We detected
scattered light echoes around two young, low-amplitude, irregular variable
stars. Observations revealed not just one, but multiple light echoes from
brightness pulses of the T Tauri star S CrA and the Herbig Ae/Be star R CrA.
Analysis of S CrA's recurring echoes suggests that the star is located 138 +/-
16 pc from Earth, making these the closest echoes ever detected. The
environment that scatters the stellar light from S CrA is compatible with an
incomplete dust shell or an inclined torus some 10,000 AU in radius and
containing $\sim$ $2 \times 10^{-3}$ $M_{\sun}$ of dust. The cause of such
concentration at $\sim$ 10,000AU from the star is unknown. It could be the
remnant of the envelope from which the star formed, but the distance of the
cloud is remarkably similar to the nominal distance of the Oort cloud to the
Sun, leading us to also speculate that the dust (or ice) seen around S CrA
might have the same origin as the Solar System Oort cloud.

Bayesian network. The basis of the algorithm is the Maximum Minimum Parents and
Children algorithm developed by previous authors, with three substantial
modifications. The MMPC algorithm is the first stage of the Maximum Minimum
Hill Climbing algorithm for learning the directed acyclic graph of a Bayesian
network, introduced by previous authors. The MMHC algorithm runs in two phases;
firstly, the MMPC algorithm to locate the skeleton and secondly an edge
orientation phase. The computationally expensive part is the edge orientation
phase.
  The first modification introduced to the MMPC algorithm, which requires
little additional computational cost, is to obtain the immoralities and hence
the essential graph. This renders the edge orientation phase, the
computationally expensive part, unnecessary, since the entire Markov structure
that can be derived from data is present in the essential graph.
  Secondly, the MMPC algorithm can accept independence statements that are
logically inconsistent with those rejected, since with tests for independence,
a `do not reject' conclusion for a particular independence statement is taken
as `accept' independence. An example is given to illustrate this and a
modification is suggested to ensure that the conditional independence
statements are logically consistent.
  Thirdly, the MMHC algorithm makes an assumption of faithfulness. An example
of a data set is given that does not satisfy this assumption and a modification
is suggested to deal with some situations where the assumption is not
satisfied. The example in question also illustrates problems with the
`faithfulness' assumption that cannot be tackled by this modification.

dimension Dirac equation for a relativistic fermion and correctly model quantum
mechanical statistics. Symmetries of the net provide various quantum mechanical
effects such as quantum uncertainty and wavefunction, phase, spin, negative
energy states and the effect of a potential. The causal net can be embedded in
3+1 dimensions and is consistent with the conventional Dirac equation. In the
low velocity limit the causal net approximates to the Schrodinger equation and
Pauli equation for an electromagnetic field. Extending to different momentum
states the net is compatible with the Feynman path integral approach to quantum
mechanics that allows calculation of well known quantum phenomena such as
diffraction.
