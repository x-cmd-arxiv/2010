dissimilar viruses that infection with one cannot confer cross-immunity to the
other. However, our examination of the records of the past 25 influenza seasons
in the U.S. reveals that almost every time there is an early and severe
influenza A outbreak, the annual influenza B epidemic is almost entirely
suppressed (and is never suppressed otherwise). Temporary broad-spectrum (aka
""heterologous"") immunity in the aftermath of influenza infection is the most
direct explanation for this phenomenon. We find a remarkably weak degree of
temporary cross-immunity is needed to explain these patterns, and that indeed
influenza B provides an ideal setting for the observation of heterologous
immune effects outside of the carefully controlled environment of a laboratory.

The asymptotic relation between properly scaled CTRW and fractional diffusion

literature. Here, we focus on a correspondence between CTRWs and time and space
fractional diffusion equation stemming from two different methods aimed to
accurately approximate anomalous diffusion processes. One of them is the Monte
Carlo simulation of uncoupled CTRW with a L\'evy $\alpha$-stable distribution
of jumps in space and a one-parameter Mittag-Leffler distribution of waiting

equation in which the physical time defined via the number of subsequent steps
of motion is itself a random variable. Both approaches are tested for their
numerical performance and verified with known analytical solutions for the
Green function of a space-time fractional diffusion equation. The comparison
demonstrates trade off between precision of constructed solutions and
computational costs. The method based on the subordinated Langevin equation
leads to a higher accuracy of results, while the CTRW framework with a
Mittag-Leffler distribution of waiting times provides efficiently an
approximate fundamental solution to the FFPE and converges to the probability
density function of the subordinated process in a long-time limit.

crucial to describing their functions in the cellular context. Significant
advances both in theory and experiments have resulted in a conceptual framework
for describing the folding mechanisms of globular proteins. The experimental
data and theoretical methods have revealed the multifaceted character of
proteins. Proteins exhibit universal features that can be determined using only
the number of amino acid residues (N) and polymer concepts. The sizes of
proteins in the denatured and folded states, cooperativity of the folding
transition, dispersions in the melting temperatures at the residue level, and
time scales of folding are to a large extent determined by N. The consequences
of finite N especially on how individual residues order upon folding depends on
the topology of the folded states. Such intricate details can be predicted
using the Molecular Transfer Model that combines simulations with measured
transfer free energies of protein building blocks from water to the desired
concentration of the denaturant. By watching one molecule fold at a time, using
single molecule methods, the validity of the theoretically anticipated
heterogeneity in the folding routes, and the N-dependent time scales for the
three stages in the approach to the native state have been established. Despite
the successes of theory, of which only a few examples are documented here, we
conclude that much remains to be done to solve the ""protein folding problem"" in
the broadest sense.

decomposed into broad (>20 km/s), medium-broad (~5-10 km/s), and narrow (<5
km/s) components. The H2-18O emission is only detected in broad 1_10-1_01 lines
(>20 km/s), indicating that its physical origin is the same as for the broad
H2-16O component. In one of the sources, IRAS4A, an inverse P Cygni profile is
observed, a clear sign of infall in the envelope. From the line profiles alone,
it is clear that the bulk of emission arises from shocks, both on small (<1000
AU) and large scales along the outflow cavity walls (~10 000 AU). The H2O line
profiles are compared to CO line profiles to constrain the H2O abundance as a
function of velocity within these shocked regions. The H2O/CO abundance ratios
are measured to be in the range of ~0.1-1, corresponding to H2O abundances of
~10-5-10-4 with respect to H2. Approximately 5-10% of the gas is hot enough for

on whether the exciton is at higher or lower energy than the cavity mode. At
high temperatures this asymmetry vanishes when the probabilities to emit or
absorb a phonon become similar. For a different dot-cavity system where the
cavity mode is detuned by \Delta E>5 meV to lower energy than the single
exciton transitions emission from the mode remains correlated with the quantum
dot as demonstrated unambiguously by cross-correlation photon counting

multi-exciton transitions. We observe a clear anti-correlation of the mode and

structural property: we show that whp the independence number of G is at least
$\Omega(n^{2/5}(\log n)^{4/5}/\log \log n)$, which matches an upper bound
obtained by Bohman up to a factor of $\Theta(\log \log n)$. Our analysis of the
K_4-free process also yields a new result in Ramsey theory: for a special case
of a well-studied function introduced by Erd\H{o}s and Rogers we slightly
improve the best known upper bound.

explored, by considering an explicit nonminimal coupling between an arbitrary
function of the scalar curvature, R, and the Lagrangian density of matter. It
is the effective stress-energy tensor containing the coupling between matter
and the higher order curvature derivatives that is responsible for the null
energy condition violation, and consequently for supporting the respective
wormhole geometries. The general restrictions imposed by the null energy
condition violation are presented in the presence of a nonminimal R-matter
coupling. Furthermore, obtaining exact solutions to the gravitational field
equations is extremely difficult due to the nonlinearity of the equations,
although the problem is mathematically well-defined. Thus, we outline several
approaches for finding wormhole solutions, and deduce an exact solution by
considering a linear R nonmiminal curvature-matter coupling and by considering
an explicit monotonically decreasing function for the energy density. Although
it is difficult to find exact solutions of matter threading the wormhole
satisfying the energy conditions at the throat, an exact solution is found
where the nonminimal coupling does indeed minimize the violation of the null
energy condition of normal matter at the throat.

to develop CR precursors. The length of such precursor $L_{p}$ is believed to
be set by the ratio of the CR mean free path $\lambda$ to the shock speed,
i.e., $L_{p}\sim c\lambda/V_{sh}\sim cr_{g}/V_{sh}$, which is formally
independent of the CR pressure $P_{c}$. However, the X-ray observations of
supernova remnant shocks suggest that the precursor scale may be significantly
shorter than $L_{p}$ which would question the above estimate unless the
magnetic field is strongly amplified and the gyroradius $r_{g}$ is strongly
reduced over a short (unresolved) spatial scale. We argue that while the CR
pressure builds up ahead of the shock, the acceleration enters into a strongly
nonlinear phase in which an acoustic instability, driven by the CR pressure
gradient, dominates other instabilities (at least in the case of low $\beta$
plasma). In this regime the precursor steepens into a strongly nonlinear front
whose size scales with \emph{the CR pressure}as $L_{f}\sim
L_{p}\cdot(L_{s}/L_{p})^{2}(P_{c}/P_{g})^{2}$, where $L_{s}$ is the scale of
the developed acoustic turbulence, and $P_{c}/P_{g}$ is the ratio of CR to gas
pressure. Since $L_{s}\ll L_{p}$, the precursor scale reduction may be strong
in the case of even a moderate gas heating by the CRs through the acoustic and
(possibly also) the other instabilities driven by the CRs.

Stability analyses for the isotropic-isotropic and the isotropic-nematic phase

interactions favor nematic ordering. Coexistence curves for the symmetric
mixtures are also constructed and are used to examine the effects of linear
charge density and electrostatic interaction strength on rodlike
polyelectrolyte complexation. It is found that the counterions are uni- formly
distributed in the coexisting phases for low electrostatic interaction
strengths dictated by the linear charge density of the polyelectrolytes and
Bjerrum's length. However, the counterions also partition along with the
rodlike polyelectrolytes with an increase in the electrostatic interaction
strength. It is shown that the number density of the counterions is higher in
the concentrated (or ""coacervate"") phase than in the dilute (or supernatant)

can undergo only isotropic-isotropic phase separation. A comparison of the

interval maps are discussed. It is shown that the proximal relation is an
equivalence relation for any zero entropy interval map. The structure of the
set of $f$-nonseparable pairs is well demonstrated and so is its relationship
to Li-Yorke chaos. For a zero entropy interval map, it is shown that a pair is
a sequence entropy pair if and only if it is $f$-nonseparable.
  Moreover, some equivalent conditions of positive entropy which relate to the
number ""3"" are obtained. It is shown that for an interval map if it is
topological null, then the pattern entropy of every open cover is of polynomial
order, answering a question by Huang and Ye when the space is the closed unit
interval.

Adding the topological term converts the particles into anyons. Using the

the topological linking number simply corresponds to the addition to the action
of the Chern-Simons term. We find the following new results. The system
continues to exhibit a phase transition as a function of the anyon mass as it
becomes small \cite{mnp}, although the phases do not change the manifestation
of the symmetry. The Chern-Simons term has no effect on the Wilson loop, but it
does affect the {\rm '}t Hooft loop. For a given configuration it adds the
linking number of the 't Hooft loop with all of the dynamical vortex loops to

Supernova data (SDSS SN), Hubble constant measurements (HST) and Baryon

Hubble parameter which has been a challenge for these models. We also try to

exemplified by the stochastic SIRS model. The birth-death master equation of
the model is simulated using exact numerics and analysed within the linear
noise approximation. The endemic fixed point is unstable to internal
demographic noise, and leads to sustained oscillations. This is ensured when
the eigenvalues ($\lambda$) of the linearised drift matrix are complex, which
in turn, is possible only if detailed balance is violated. In the oscillatory
state, the phases decorrelate asymptotically, distinguishing such oscillations
from those produced by external periodic forcing. These so-called quasicycles
are of sufficient strength to be detected reliably only when the ratio
$|Im(\lambda)/Re(\lambda)|$ is of order unity. The coherence or regularity of
these oscillations show a maximum as a function of population size, an effect
known variously as stochastic coherence or coherence resonance. We find that
stochastic coherence can be simply understood as resulting from a non-monotonic
variation of $|Im(\lambda)/Re(\lambda)|$ with population size. Thus, within the
linear noise approximation, stochastic coherence can be predicted from a purely
deterministic analysis. The non-normality of the linearised drift matrix,
associated with the violation of detailed balance, leads to enhanced
fluctuations in the population amplitudes.

formulations for time-harmonic acoustic scattering by a sound soft bounded
obstacle. In recent work, we have proved lower and upper bounds on the $L^2$
condition numbers for these formulations, and also on the norms of the
classical acoustic single- and double-layer potential operators. These bounds
to some extent make explicit the dependence of condition numbers on the wave
number $k$, the geometry of the scatterer, and the coupling parameter. For
example, with the usual choice of coupling parameter they show that, while the
condition number grows like $k^{1/3}$ as $k\to\infty$, when the scatterer is a
circle or sphere, it can grow as fast as $k^{7/5}$ for a class of `trapping'
obstacles. In this paper we prove further bounds, sharpening and extending our
previous results. In particular we show that there exist trapping obstacles for
which the condition numbers grow as fast as $\exp(\gamma k)$, for some
$\gamma>0$, as $k\to\infty$ through some sequence. This result depends on
exponential localisation bounds on Laplace eigenfunctions in an ellipse that we
prove in the appendix. We also clarify the correct choice of coupling parameter
in 2D for low $k$. In the second part of the paper we focus on the boundary
element discretisation of these operators.
  We discuss the extent to which the bounds on the continuous operators are
also satisfied by their discrete counterparts and, via numerical experiments,
we provide supporting evidence for some of the theoretical results, both

$\lambda$ nodes per unit area, throughput is found to scale by a factor of
$\sqrt{\log{\lambda}}$ worse compared to the upper bound which is due to the
uncertainty in the nodes' location. In the present model, nodes are assumed to
know their geographical location and to employ power control, which we
understand as an additional degree of freedom to improve network performance.
The expected throughput-progress and the expected packet delay normalized to
the one-hop progress are chosen as performance metrics. These metrics are
investigated for a nearest neighbor forwarding strategy, which benefits from
power control by reducing transmission power and, hence spatial contention. It
is shown that the connectivity-throughput trade-off can be resolved if nodes
employ a nearest neighbor forwarding strategy, achieving the upper bound on
throughput on average also in a random network while ensuring asymptotic
connectivity. In this case, the optimal throughput-delay scaling trade-off is
also achieved.

potential is caused by the fact that the energy current is carried by particles
which may have arbitrary low speed with sufficiently large probability.

often the star is the only visible component and therefore used to infer the
planet's fundamental parameters. Another important aspect of the analysis of
planetary systems is the stellar activity and the possible star-planet
interaction. Here we present a self-consistent abundance analysis of the planet
hosting star WASP-12 and a high-precision search for a structured stellar
magnetic field on the basis of spectropolarimetric observations obtained with
the ESPaDOnS spectropolarimeter. Our results show that the star does not have a
structured magnetic field, and that the obtained fundamental parameters are in
good agreement with what was previously published. In addition we derive
improved constraints on the stellar age (1.0-2.65 Gyr), mass (1.23-1.49 M/M0),
and distance (295-465 pc). WASP-12 is an ideal object to look for pollution
signatures in the stellar atmosphere. We analyse the WASP-12 abundances as a
function of the condensation temperature and compare them with those published
by several other authors on planet hosting and non-planet hosting stars. We
find hints of atmospheric pollution in WASP-12's photosphere, but are unable to
reach firm conclusions with our present data. We conclude that a differential
analysis based on WASP-12 twins will probably clarify if an atmospheric
pollution is present, the nature of this pollution and its implications in the
planet formation and evolution. We attempt also the direct detection of the
circumstellar disk through infrared excess, but without success.

$\beta$ Cep to be encountered in low metallicity environments such as the Small
Magellanic Cloud. However recent variability surveys of B stars in the SMC
reported the detection of a significant number of SPB and $\beta$ Cep

$\beta$ Cep and SPB pulsations, the chemical mixture representative of the SMC
B stars such as recently derived does not leave room for a significant increase
of the iron abundance in these stars. Whilst abundance of iron-group elements

  application to interaction-induced star formation","Submitted to MNRAS Letters. Corrections suggested by the referee
  included",,,,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Weighted correlation functions are an increasingly important tool for
understanding how galaxy properties depend on their separation from each other.
We use a mock galaxy sample drawn from the Millenium simulation, assigning
weights using a simple prescription to illustrate and explore how well a
weighted correlation function recovers the true radial dependence of the input
weights. We find that the use of a weighted correlation function results in a
dilution of the magnitude of any radial dependence of properties and a smearing
out of that radial dependence in radius, compared to the input behavior. We
present a quantitative discussion of the dilution in the magnitude of radial
dependence in properties in the special case of a constant enhancement at r <
rc. In this particular case where there was a SFR enhancement at small radius r
< rc = 35 kpc, the matching of one member of an enhanced pair with a
non-enhanced galaxy in the same group gives an artificial enhancement out to
large radius ~ 200 kpc. We compare this with observations of SFR enhancement
from the SDSS (Li et al. 2008; MNRAS, 385, 1903) finding very similar behavior
- a significant enhancement at radii < 40 kpc and a weak enhancement out to
more than 150 kpc. While we explore a particular case in this Letter, it is
easy to see that the phenomenon is general, and precision analyses of weighted
correlation functions will need to account carefully for this effect using
simulated mock catalogs.

(LBM) to study pattern formation in reaction-diffusion systems. As a first
methodological step, we consider the case of a single species undergoing
transformation reaction and diffusion. In this case, we perform a third-order
Chapman-Enskog multiscale expansion and study the dependence of the Lattice
Boltzmann truncation error on the diffusion coefficient and the reaction rate.
These findings are in good agreement with numerical simulations. Furthermore,
taking the Gray-Scott model as a prominent example, we provide evidence for the
maturity of the LBM in studying pattern formation in non-linear
reaction-diffusion systems. For this purpose, we perform linear stability
analysis of the Gray-Scott model and determine the relevant parameter range for
pattern formation. Lattice Boltzmann simulations allow not only to test the
validity of the linear stability phase diagram including Turing and Hopf
instabilities, but also permit going beyond the linear stability regime, where
large perturbations give rise to interesting dynamical behavior such as the so
called self replicating spots. We also show that the length scale of the
patterns may be tuned by rescaling all relevant diffusion coefficients in the
system with the same factor while letting all the reaction constants unchanged.

long-term memory can -- as a gradual modification of synaptic weights -- since
it takes place too quickly. Theories based on some form of cellular
bistability, however, do not seem able to account for the fact that noisy
neurons can collectively store information in a robust manner. We show how a
sufficiently clustered network of simple model neurons can be instantly induced
into metastable states capable of retaining information for a short time (a few
seconds). The mechanism is robust to different network topologies and kinds of
neural model. This could constitute a viable means available to the brain for
sensory and/or short-term memory with no need of synaptic learning. Relevant
phenomena described by neurobiology and psychology, such as local
synchronization of synaptic inputs and power-law statistics of forgetting
avalanches, emerge naturally from this mechanism, and we suggest possible
experiments to test its viability in more biological settings.

high redshift due to increased star-formation rates (SFRs), are known to
provide a good fit to the colours and number counts of galaxies throughout the
optical and near-infrared. We show that optically defined PLE models, where
dust reradiates absorbed optical light into infrared spectra composed of local
galaxy templates, fit galaxy counts and colours out to 8um and to at least
z=2.5. At 24-70um, the model is able to reproduce the observed source counts
with reasonable success if 16% of spiral galaxies show an excess in mid-IR flux
due to a warmer dust component and a higher SFR, in line with observations of
local starburst galaxies. There remains an under-prediction of the number of
faint-flux, high-z sources at 24um, so we explore how the evolution may be
altered to correct this. At 160um and longer wavelengths, the model fails, with
our model of normal galaxies accounting for only a few percent of sources in
these bands. However, we show that a PLE model of obscured AGN, which we have
previously shown to give a good fit to observations at 850um, also provides a
reasonable fit to the Herschel/BLAST number counts and redshift distributions

shorter wavelengths would still need to be explained.

Hamiltonian formulations of General Relativity, in which different

canonical transformation. The example was given by the Hamiltonian formulation
of Dirac and that of Arnowitt - Deser - Misner. It might witness for
non-equivalence of these formulations and the original (Lagrangian) formulation
of General Relativity. The problem is believed to be of importance since many
authors make use of various representations of gravitational field as a
starting point in searching a way to reconcile the theory of gravity with
quantum principles. It can be shown that the mentioned above conclusion about
non-equivalence of different Hamiltonian formulations is based on the
consideration of canonical transformations in phase space of physical degrees
of freedom only, while the transformations also involve gauge degrees of
freedom. We shall give a clear proof that Hamiltonian formulations
corresponding to different parametrizations of gravitational variables are
related by canonical transformations in extended phase space embracing gauge
degrees of freedom on an equal footing with physical ones. It will be
demonstrated for the full gravitational theory in a wide enough class of
parametrizations and gauge conditions.

Energy and nonlinear electrodynamics are fundamental in a unified nonlinear

Gravitation and electromagnetism are unified giving Einstein's equation and a
geometric energy momentum tensor. A solution energy in the newtonian limit
gives the gravitational constant G. Outside of this limit G is variable. May be
interpreted as dark matter or energy. In vacuum, known gravitational solutions
are obtained. Electromagnetism is an SU(2) subgroup. A U(1) limit gives
Maxwell's equations. Geometric fields determine a generalized Dirac equation
and are the germ of quantum physics. Planck's h and of Einstein's c are given
by the potential and the metric. Excitations have quanta of charge, flux and
spin determining the FQHE. There are only three stable 1/2 spin fermions. Mass
is a form of energy. The rest energies of the fermions give the proton/electron
mass ratio. Potential excitations have energies equal to the weak boson masses
allowing a geometric interpretation of Weinberg's angle. SU(2) gives the
anomalous magnetic moments of proton, electron, neutron and generates nuclear
range attractive potentials strong enough to produce the binding energies of
the deuteron and other nuclides. Lepton and meson masses are due to topological
excitations. The geometric mass spectrum is satisfactory. The proton has a
triple structure. The alpha constant is a geometric number.

SDSS J1155+6346, SDSS J1226-0006, WFI J2026-4536 and HS 2209+1914. In doing so,
we obtain relative positions for the lensed images and shape parameters for the
light distribution of the lensing galaxy in each system. The lensed image
positions are derived with 1-2 mas accuracy. To predict time delays and to test
the ability of simple mass models to reproduce the observed configuration,
isothermal and de Vaucouleurs mass models are calculated for the whole sample
using state-of-the-art modeling techniques. The effect of the lens environment
on the lens mass models is taken into account with a shear term. Doubly imaged
quasars are equally well fitted by each of these models. A large amount of
shear is necessary to reproduce SDSS J1155+6346 and SDSS J1226-006. In the
latter case, we identify a nearby galaxy as the dominant source of shear. The
quadruply imaged quasar SDSS J1138+0314 is well reproduced by simple lens
models, which is not the case for the two other quads, RX J1131-1231 and WFI
J2026-4536. This might be the signature of astrometric perturbations due to
massive substructures in the lensing galaxy unaccounted for by the models.
Other possible explanations are also presented.

duration in the range of 20-250 years. Five type of data series are used: 1)
The Zurich series (1749-2009), the mean annual International sunspot number Ri;
2) The Group sunspot number series Rh (1610-1995); 3) The simulated extended
sunspot Rsi number from Extended time series of Solar Activity Indices (ESAI)
(1090- 2002); 4) The simulated extended geomagnetic aa-index from ESAI
(1099-2002); 5) The Meudon filament series (1919-1991) (it is used only
particularly). Data series are smoothed over 11 years and supercenturial trends
are removed. Two principally independent methods of time series analysis are
used: the T-R periodogram analysis (both in the standard and ""scanning window""
regimes) and the wavelet-analysis. The obtained results are very similar. It is
found that in all series a strong cycle with mean duration of 55-60 years
exists. It is very well expressed in the 18th and the 19th centuries. It is
less pronounced during the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th
centuries. On the other hand a strong and stable quasi 110-120 years and
~200-year cycles are obtained in most of these series. However the 200-yr cycle
is not detectable in the Zurich series. There is a strong mean oscillation of ~
95 years, which is absent in the other data sets. The analysis of the ESAI (AD
1090-2002) proved that the quasi century cycle has a relatively stable doublet
(~80 and ~120 years) or triplet (~55-60, 80 and 120 years) structure during the
last ~900 years. Most probably the different type of oscillations in the
sub-century and century period range corresponds to cycles of different classes
of active regions. The solar-terrestrial relationships aspects of these results
are briefly discussed.

stabilize the C-type AF state is analyzed based on the competition between the
itinerant Stoner instability and superexchange, and our results suggest that
the magnetic instability rather than the orbital or lattice instabilities plays
an important role in this system. The experimentally observed compressive
tetragonal distortion can be naturally explained from the C-type AF state. By

dependencies between these impacts and environmental receptors. Up to now, this

  We observe adsorbed and desorbed phases with a thermodynamic phase transition
in between. In the absence of a pulling force this model has a second-order
thermal desorption transition which merely gets shifted by the presence of a
lateral pulling force. On the other hand, if the pulling force contains a
non-zero vertical component this transition becomes first-order.
  Strikingly, we find that if the angle between the pulling force and the

polymer adsorption, no matter how large the temperature of the system.
  Our findings are similar in two and three dimensions, an additional feature
in three dimensions being the occurrence of a reentrance transition at constant
pulling force for small temperature, which has been observed previously for
this model in the presence of pure vertical pulling. Interestingly, the
reentrance phenomenon vanishes under certain pulling angles, with details

(GRBs), we develop a numerical scheme and code for estimating the deposition of
energy and momentum due to the neutrino pair annihilation ($\nu + {\bar \nu}
\rightarrow e^{-} + e^{+}$) in the vicinity of accretion tori around a Kerr
black hole. Our code is designed to solve the general relativistic neutrino
transfer by a ray-tracing method. To solve the collisional Boltzmann equation
in curved spacetime, we numerically integrate the so-called rendering equation
along the null geodesics. For the neutrino opacity, the charged-current
$\beta$-processes are taken into account, which are dominant in the vicinity of
the accretion tori. The numerical accuracy of the developed code is
certificated by several tests, in which we show comparisons with the
corresponding analytic solutions. Based on the hydrodynamical data in our
collapsar simulation, we estimate the annihilation rates in a post-processing
manner. Increasing the Kerr parameter from 0 to 1, it is found that the general
relativistic effect can increase the local energy deposition rate by about one
order of magnitude, and the net energy deposition rate by several tens of
percents. After the accretion disk settles into a stationary state (typically
later than $\sim 9$ s from the onset of gravitational collapse), we point out
that the neutrino-heating timescale in the vicinity of the polar funnel region
can be shorter than the dynamical timescale. Our results suggest the neutrino
pair annihilation has a potential importance equal to the conventional
magnetohydrodynamic mechanism for igniting the GRB fireballs.

the cold dark matter paradigm, and their shape in the innermost regions has
been hotly debated over the last decades. The present work shows that dark
matter annihilation into electron-positron pairs may affect the observed
rotation curve by a significant amount. We adopt a model-independent approach,
where all the electrons and positrons are injected with the same initial energy
E_0 ~ m_dm*c^2 in the range from 1 MeV to 1 TeV and the injection rate is
constrained by INTEGRAL, Fermi, and HESS data. The pressure of the relativistic
electron-positron gas is determined by solving the diffusion-loss equation,
considering inverse Compton scattering, synchrotron radiation, Coulomb
collisions, bremsstrahlung, and ionization. For values of the gas density and
magnetic field that are representative of the Milky Way, it is estimated that
pressure gradients are strong enough to balance gravity in the central parts if
E_0 < 1 GeV. The exact value depends somewhat on the astrophysical parameters,
and it changes dramatically with the slope of the dark matter density profile.
For very steep slopes, as those expected from adiabatic contraction, the
rotation curves of spiral galaxies would be affected on ~kpc scales for most
values of E_0. By comparing the predicted rotation curves with observations of
dwarf and low surface brightness galaxies, we show that the pressure from dark
matter annihilation may improve the agreement between theory and observations
in some cases, but it also imposes severe constraints on the model parameters
(most notably, the inner slope of halo density profile, as well as the mass and
the annihilation cross-section of dark matter particles into electron-positron
pairs).

between declinations -$90\degr$ and -47$\degr$ with 0$\farcs$40 yr$^{-1}$ $>$

new systems for the same region of the sky covered by previous SuperCOSMOS
RECONS (SCR) searches that used Schmidt plates as the primary source of
discovery. Among the new systems are 25 multiples, plus an additional seven new
common proper motion companions found to previously known primaries. All stars
have been discovered using the third U.S. Naval Observatory (USNO) CCD
Astrograph Catalog (UCAC3). A comparison of the UCAC3 proper motions to those
from the Hipparcos, Tycho-2, Southern Proper Motion (SPM4), and SuperCOSMOS
efforts is presented, and shows that UCAC3 provides similar values and
precision to the first three surveys. The comparison between UCAC3 and
SuperCOSMOS indicates that proper motions in RA are systematically shifted in
the SuperCOSMOS data but are consistent in DEC data, while overall showing a
significantly higher scatter. Distance estimates are derived for stars having
SuperCOSMOS Sky Survey (SSS) $B_J$, $R_{59F}$, and $I_{IVN}$ plate magnitudes
and Two-Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) infrared photometry. We find 15 systems
estimated to be within 25 pc, including UPM 1710-5300 our closest new discovery
estimated at 13.5 pc. Such new discoveries suggest that more nearby stars are
yet to be found in these slower proper motion regimes, indicating that more
work is needed to develop a complete map of the solar neighborhood.

for all major emission lines between Ly-alpha and H-beta in a sample of six
quasars. The sources were chosen with two criteria in mind: the existence of
high quality optical and UV spectra as well as the possibility to sample the
spectroscopic diversity in the 4D Eigenvector 1 context . In the latter sense
each source occupies a region (bin) in the FWHM(H-beta) vs. optical FeII
strength plane that is significantly different from the others. High S/N H-beta
emission line profiles are used as templates for modeling the other lines
(Ly-alpha, CIV 1549, HeII 1640, Al III 1860, Si III] 1892, and Mg II 2800). We
can adequately model all broad lines assuming the existence of three components
distinguished by blueshifted, unshifted and redshifted centroids (indicated as
blue, broad and very broad component respectively). The broad component (high
electron density, low ionization parameter; high column density) is present in
almost all type-1 quasars and therefore corresponds most closely to the
classical broad line emitting region (the reverberating component). The blue
component emission (lower electron density; high ionization; low column
density) arises in less optically thick gas; it is often thought to arise in an
accretion disk wind. The least understood component involves the very broad
component (high ionization and large column density). It is perhaps the most
distinguishing characteristic of quasars with FWHM H-beta > 4000 km/s that
belong to the so-called Population B of our 4DE1 space. Population A quasars
(FWHM H-beta < 4000 km/s) are dominated by broad component emission in H-beta
and blue component emission in CIV 1549 and other high ionization lines. 4DE1
appears to be the most useful current context for revealing and unifying
spectral diversity in type-1 quasars.

cluster population in the nearby galaxy NGC5194 (M51a), for which
multi-wavelength observations from the Hubble Space Telescope are available.
Our results indicate that the proposed method can probe the upper end of the
IMF in galaxies located out to at least ~10 Mpc, i.e., a factor ~200 further
away than possible by counting individual stars in young compact clusters. Our
results for NGC5194 show no obvious dependence of the upper mass end of the IMF
on the mass of the star cluster down to ~1000 M_sun, although more extensive
analyses involving lower mass clusters and other galaxies are needed to confirm
this conclusion.
