  Circumscription",,,,,"cs.AI cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Circumscription is a representative example of a nonmonotonic reasoning
inference technique. Circumscription has often been studied for first order
theories, but its propositional version has also been the subject of extensive
research, having been shown equivalent to extended closed world assumption
(ECWA). Moreover, entailment in propositional circumscription is a well-known
example of a decision problem in the second level of the polynomial hierarchy.
This paper proposes a new Boolean Satisfiability (SAT)-based algorithm for
entailment in propositional circumscription that explores the relationship of
propositional circumscription to minimal models. The new algorithm is inspired
by ideas commonly used in SAT-based model checking, namely counterexample
guided abstraction refinement. In addition, the new algorithm is refined to
compute the theory closure for generalized close world assumption (GCWA).
Experimental results show that the new algorithm can solve problem instances
that other solutions are unable to solve.

other one using minimum edit distance. Each of these techniques is applied on
different sets of characters for recognition. In the first stage, two sets of
features are computed and two classifiers are applied to get higher recognition
accuracy. Two MLP's are used separately to recognize the characters. For one of
the MLP's the characters are represented with their shadow features and for the
other chain code histogram feature is used. The decision of both MLP's is
combined using weighted majority scheme. Top three results produced by combined
MLP's in the first stage are used to calculate the relative difference values.
In the second stage, based on these relative differences character set is
divided into two. First set consists of the characters with distinct shapes and
second set consists of confused characters, which appear very similar in
shapes. Characters of distinct shapes of first set are classified using MLP.
Confused characters in second set are classified using minimum edit distance
method. Method of minimum edit distance makes use of corner detected in a
character image using modified Harris corner detection technique. Experiment on
this method is carried out on a database of 7154 samples. The overall

explicitly broken by quantum corrections, which can trigger electroweak

in a perturbative and phenomenologically viable theory. We present a complete

that the addition of transitions where a point is moved from one location to

experiments aim at providing the most direct evidence for inflation through the
detection of $B$-modes in the CMB polarization, presumed to have been caused by
gravitational waves generated during the inflationary epoch around $10^{-34}$s.
The $B$-mode polarization signals are very small ($\leq$10$^{-8}$K) compared
with the temperature anisotropies ($\sim 10^{-4}$K). Systematic effects in CMB
telescopes can cause leakage from temperature anisotropy into polarization.
Bolometric interferometry (BI) is a novel approach to measuring this small
signal with lower leakage. If BI can be made to work over wide bandwidth
($\sim20-30\%$) it can provide similar sensitivity to imagers. Subdividing the
frequency passband of a Fizeau interferometer would mitigate the problem of
`fringe smearing.' Furthermore, the approach should allow simultaneous
measurements in image space and visibility space. For subdividing the frequency
passsband (`sub-band splitting' henceforth), we write an expression for the
output from every baseline at every detector in the focal plane as a sum of
visibilities in different frequency sub-bands. For operating the interferometer
simultaneously as an imager, we write the output as two integrals over the sky
and the focal plane, with all the phase differences accounted for.}{The

the transverse trapping frequency across the mechanical instability from a
linear chain to the zigzag structure. The density of defects after the sweep
can be conveniently described by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. In particular, the
number of kinks in the zigzag ordering can be derived from a time-dependent
Ginzburg-Landau equation for the order parameter, here the zigzag transverse
size, under the assumption that the ions are continuously laser cooled. In a
linear Paul trap the transition becomes inhomogeneous, being the charge density
larger in the center and more rarefied at the edges. During the linear quench
the mechanical instability is first crossed in the center of the chain, and a
front, at which the mechanical instability is crossed during the quench, is
identified which propagates along the chain from the center to the edges. If
the velocity of this front is smaller than the sound velocity, the dynamics
becomes adiabatic even in the thermodynamic limit and no defect is produced.
Otherwise, the nucleation of kinks is reduced with respect to the case in which
the charges are homogeneously distributed, leading to a new scaling of the

  Achievable Rate and Optimal Power Allocation","To appear in IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the problem of secure communication with multi-antenna
transmission in fading channels. The transmitter simultaneously transmits an
information bearing signal to the intended receiver and artificial noise to the
eavesdroppers. We obtain an analytical closed-form expression of an achievable
secrecy rate, and use it as the objective function to optimize the transmit
power allocation between the information signal and the artificial noise. Our
analytical and numerical results show that equal power allocation is a simple
yet near optimal strategy for the case of non-colluding eavesdroppers. When the
number of colluding eavesdroppers increases, more power should be used to
generate the artificial noise. We also provide an upper bound on the
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) above which the achievable secrecy rate is positive
and show that the bound is tight at low SNR. Furthermore, we consider the
impact of imperfect channel state information (CSI) at both the transmitter and
the receiver and find that it is wise to create more artificial noise to
confuse the eavesdroppers than to increase the signal strength for the intended
receiver if the CSI is not accurately obtained.

quantum communication. The utility of such pairs is measured by how long they
take to disentangle or decohere. To answer the question of whether qubit-qubit
interactions can prolong entanglement, we calculate the dissipative dynamics of
a pair of qubits coupled via the exchange interaction in the presence of random
telegraph noise and $1/f$ noise. We show that for maximally entangled (Bell)
states, the exchange interaction generally suppresses decoherence and
disentanglement. This suppression is more apparent for random telegraph noise
if the noise is non-Markovian, whereas for $1/f$ noise the exchange interaction
should be comparable in magnitude to strongest noise source. The entangled
singlet-triplet superposition state of 2 qubits ($\psi_{\pm}$ Bell state) can
be protected by the interaction, while for the triplet-triplet state
($\phi_{\pm}$ Bell state), it is less effective. Thus the former is more
suitable for encoding quantum information.

an empty statement - couldn't an Institute of Complex Systems just as well be
called an Institute for Almost Everything? Despite these valid concerns, the
world is indeed made of many highly interconnected parts over many scales,
whose interactions result in a complex behaviour needing separate

new features emerge as one goes from one scale to another, so it follows that
the science of complexity is about revealing the principles governing the ways

conventional astrophysical background of very high energy gamma rays from these
objects appears to be negligible, they are good targets to search for the
secondary gamma-ray photons produced by interacting or decaying dark matter
particles. No significant gamma-ray flux above 200 GeV was detected from these
four dwarf galaxies for a typical exposure of ~20 hours. The 95% confidence
upper limits on the integral gamma-ray flux are in the range 0.4-2.2x10^-12

annihilation of weakly interacting massive particles and derive constraints on
the thermally averaged product of the total self-annihilation cross section and
the relative velocity of the WIMPs. The limits are obtained under conservative
assumptions regarding the dark matter distribution in dwarf galaxies and are
approximately three orders of magnitude above the generic theoretical
prediction for WIMPs in the minimal supersymmetric standard model framework.
However significant uncertainty exists in the dark matter distribution as well

exhibit a rich dynamics, where at intermediate stages the horizon can be
described as a sequence of 3-dimensional spherical black holes joined by black
string segments. These segments are themselves subject to a Gregory-Laflamme
instability, resulting in a self-similar cascade, where ever-smaller satellite
black holes form connected by ever-thinner string segments. This behavior is
akin to satellite formation in low-viscosity fluid streams subject to the
Rayleigh-Plateau instability. The simulation results imply that the string
segments will reach zero radius in finite asymptotic time, whence the classical
space-time terminates in a naked singularity. Since no fine-tuning is required
to excite the instability, this constitutes a generic violation of cosmic
censorship.

system composed of point-mass stellar (or sub-stellar) binary and a low-mass
companion (a circumbinary planet or a brown dwarf). We take into account the
leading relativistic corrections to the Newtonian gravity. The secular model of
the system relies on the expansion of the perturbing Hamiltonian in terms of
the ratio of semi-major axes $\alpha$, averaged over the mean anomalies. We
found that the low-mass object in a distant orbit may excite large eccentricity
of the inner binary when the mutual inclination of the orbits is larger than
about of 60 deg. This is related to strong instability caused by a phenomenon
which acts similarly to the Lidov-Kozai resonance (LKR). The secular system may
be strongly chaotic and its dynamics unpredictable over the long-term time
scale. Our study shows that in the Jupiter-- or brown dwarf-- mass regime of
the low-massive companion, the restricted model does not properly describe the
long-term dynamics in the vicinity of the LKR. The relativistic correction is
significant for the parametric structure of a few families of stationary
solutions in this problem, in particular, for the direct orbits configurations
(with the mutual inclination less than 90 degrees). We found that the dynamics
of hierarchical systems with small $\alpha \sim 0.01$ may be qualitatively
different in the realm of the Newtonian (classic) and relativistic models. This
holds true even for relatively large masses of the secondaries.

regions near the forward shock. Synchrotron emission from the electrons can
account for data from radio to X-ray wavelengths. Much of the GeV-TeV emission
can also be explained by a combination of bremsstrahlung emission and
inverse-Compton scattering (mainly of infrared thermal photons). However, the

accounted for by adding a pion-zero emission component to the model, providing
evidence for cosmic ray production in Cas A. We discuss the implications of the

environments of several short-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with
sub-arcsecond optical afterglow positions but no bright coincident host
galaxies. The purpose of this joint study is to robustly assess the possibility
of significant offsets, a hallmark of the compact object binary merger model.
Five such events exist in the current sample of 20 short bursts with optical
afterglows, and we find that their optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray emission are
systematically fainter. These differences may be due to lower circumburst
densities (by about an order of magnitude), to higher redshifts (by dz~0.5-1),
or to lower energies, although in the standard GRB model the smaller gamma-ray
fluences cannot be explained by lower densities. To study the large-scale
environments we use deep optical observations to place limits on underlying
hosts and to determine probabilities of chance coincidence for galaxies near
each burst. In 4 of the 5 cases the lowest probabilities of chance coincidence
(P(<dR)~0.1) are associated with bright galaxies at separations of dR~10"",
while somewhat higher probabilities of chance coincidence are associated with
faint galaxies at separations of ~2"". By measuring redshifts for the brighter
galaxies in three cases (z=0.111, 0.473, 0.403) we find physical offsets of
~30-75 kpc, while for the faint hosts the assumption of z>1 leads to offsets of
~15 kpc. Alternatively, the limits at the burst positions (>26 mag) can be
explained by typical short GRB host galaxies (L~0.1-1 L*) at z>2. Thus, two
possibilities exist: (i) ~1/4 of short GRBs explode ~50 kpc or ~15 kpc from the
centers of z~0.3 or z>1 galaxies, respectively, and have fainter afterglows due
to the resulting lower densities; or (ii) ~1/4 of short GRBs occur at z>2 and
have fainter afterglows due to their higher redshifts.

model includes direct production, higher resonances, and high energy processes
in order to model the neutrino flavor and neutrino-antineutrino ratios with
sufficient accuracy. Since we assume that the sources are optically thin to
neutron interactions, we include the neutrino fluxes from neutron decays. We
classify the Hillas plot into regions with different characteristic flavor
ratios over 20x24 orders of magnitude in R and B. In some examples with sizable
magnetic fields, we recover neutron beam, pion beam, and muon damped beam as a
function of energy. However, we also find anomalous or new sources, such as
muon beam sources with a flavor ratio nu_e:nu_mu:nu_tau of 1:1:0 in energy
regions where the synchrotron-damped muons pile up. We also discuss the use of
the Glashow resonance to identify pgamma optically thin sources with a strong
imbalance between pi^+ and pi^- production. We find that these can, in

opens up new possibilities for testing general relativity. This paper develops
a technique for fitting nearly-Keplerian orbits with perturbations from
Schwarzschild curvature, frame dragging, and spin-induced torque, to redshift
measurements distributed along the orbit but concentrated around pericenter.
Both orbital and light-path effects are taken into account. It turns out that
absolute calibration of rest-frame frequency is not required. Hence, if pulsars
on orbits similar to the S stars are discovered, the technique described here
can be applied without change, allowing the much greater accuracies of pulsar
timing to be taken advantage of. For example, pulse timing of 3 microsec over
one hour amounts to an effective redshift precision of 30 cm/s, enough to
measure frame dragging and the quadrupole moment from an S2-like orbit,
provided problems like the Newtonian ""foreground"" due to other masses can be
overcome. On the other hand, if stars with orbital periods of order a month are
discovered, the same could be accomplished with stellar spectroscopy from the

supernova, the near-IR emission is likely due to shock heated dust since the
elapsed time from peak is too long to support a near-IR dust echo and the
decline in luminosity is shallower than the 56Co slope. If it is reprocessed
emission from a surviving progenitor, a dust photosphere must have
reestablished itself closer to the star than before the transient (~40 AU

map the Galactic halo in four dimensions (position, distance and velocity). We
find that the halo extends to at least 100 kpc in Galactocentric distance, and
obeys a single power-law density profile of index ~-2.5 in two different
directions separated by 150 degrees on the sky. This suggests that the halo is
spherical. Our map shows no large kinematically coherent structures (streams,
clouds or plumes) and appears homogeneous. However, we find that at least 20%
of the stars in the halo reside in substructures and that these substructures
are dynamically young. The velocity dispersion profile of the halo appears to
increase towards large radii while the stellar velocity distribution is non
Gaussian beyond 60 kpc. We argue that the outer halo consists of a multitude of
low luminosity overlapping tidal streams from recently accreted objects.

kinematic structure and harbours detections of neutral (SI, CI), singly (e.g.
CII, SII) and multiply ionized (e.g. CIV, SiIV) species as well as molecular H
and HD. The plethora of detected transitions in various ionization stages is
indicative of a complex multi-phase structure present in this high redshift
galaxy. We demonstrate that the ionization corrections in this sub-DLA are
significant (up to ~0.7 dex). For example, if no ionization correction is
applied, a super-solar metallicity is derived ([S/H] = +0.36), whereas a single
phase ionization correction reduces this to [S/H] = -0.19. The theoretical
impact of a multi-phase medium is investigated through Cloudy modelling and it
is found that the abundances of Si, S and Fe are always over-estimated (by up
to 0.15 dex in our experiments) if a single-phase is assumed. Therefore,
although Cloudy models improve estimates of metal column densities, the
simplification of a single phase medium leaves a systematic error in the
result, so that even ionization-corrected abundances may still be too high.
Without ionization corrections the properties of this sub-DLA appear to require
extreme scenarios of nucleosynthetic origins. After ionization corrections are
applied the ISM of this galaxy appears to be similar to some of the sightlines
through the Milky Way.

tidal stripping and tidal heating. We find that in order to best match the
evolution of angular momentum measured from N-body simulation, mass stripping
by tidal force should become inefficient after subhalo has experienced a few
passages of pericenter. It is also found that the often used Coulomb logarithm
$\ln M/m$ has to be revised to best fit the merging time-scales from
simulation. Combining the analytical model with the Extended Press-Schechter
(EPS) based merger trees, we study the subhalo mass function, and their spatial
distribution in a Milky-Way (MW) type halo. By tuning the tidal stripping
efficiency, we can gain a better match to the subhalo mass function from
simulation. The predicted distribution of subhaloes is found to agree with the
distribution of MW satellites, but is more concentrated than the simulation
results. The radial distribution of subhaloes depends weakly on subhaloes mass
at both present day and the time of accretion, but strongly on the accretion

The unperturbed solution describes a Universe that is asymptotically Minkowski
in the past, expands with increasing energy density until it exits the regime
of validity of the effective field theory and reheats. This solution is a
dynamical attractor and the Universe is driven to it, even if it is initially
contracting. The study of perturbations of the Galileon field reveals some
subtleties, related to the gross violation of the NEC and it shows that
adiabatic perturbations are cosmologically irrelevant. The model, however,
suggests a new way to produce a scale invariant spectrum of isocurvature
perturbations, which can later be converted to adiabatic: the Galileon is
forced by symmetry to couple to the other fields as a dilaton; the effective
metric it yields on the NEC violating solution is that of de Sitter space, so

the shower development, so are sensitive to the interaction cross sections. At

microinstabilities by sheared flow is investigated, focusing on the ion
temperature gradient mode. Using a twisting mode representation in sheared slab
geometry, the characteristic equations have been formulated for a dissipative
fluid model, developed rigorously from the gyrokinetic equation. They clearly
show that perpendicular flow shear convects perturbations along the field at a
speed we denote by $Mc_s$ (where $c_s$ is the sound speed), whilst parallel
flow shear enters as an instability driving term analogous to the usual
temperature and density gradient effects. For sufficiently strong perpendicular
flow shear, $M >1$, the propagation of the system characteristics is
unidirectional and no unstable eigenmodes may form. Perturbations are swept
along the field, to be ultimately dissipated as they are sheared ever more
strongly. Numerical studies of the equations also reveal the existence of
stable regions when $M < 1$, where the driving terms conflict. However, in both
cases transitory perturbations exist, which could attain substantial amplitudes
before decaying. Indeed, for $M \gg 1$, they are shown to exponentiate
$\sqrt{M}$ times. This may provide a subcritical route to turbulence in
tokamaks.

resolution in H13CO+. We detected the 13 clumps in H13CO+ line emission and
obtained the physical parameters of the clumps with radii of 0.24-0.75pc,
masses of 100-1400Msun, and velocity widths in FWHM of 1.5-4.0kms^-1. The mean
density is 3.9x10^4cm^-3 and the equivalent Jeans length is 0.13pc at 20K. We
classified the H13CO+ clumps into three types, Type A, B, and C according to
the relative locations of the H13CO+ clumps and the clusters. Our
classification represents an evolutionary trend of cluster-forming clumps
because dense clumps are expected to be converted into stellar constituents, or
dispersed by stellar activities. We found a similar but clearer trend than our
previous results for derived star formation efficiencies to increase from Type
A to C in the H13CO+ data, and for the dense gas regions within the clumps
traced by H13CO+ to be sensitive to the physical evolution of clump-cluster
systems. In addition, we found that four out of 13 H13CO+ clumps which we named
DVSOs(Distinct Velocity Structure Objects) have distinct velocity gradients at
the central parts of them. Assuming that the velocity gradients represent the
rigid-like rotation of the clumps, we calculated the virial parameter of the
H13CO+ clumps by taking into account the contribution of rotation, and found
that the DVSOs tend to be gravitationally unbound. In order to explain the
above physical properties for DVSOs, we propose a clump-clump collision model

In the novel scheme, diffusion bonding is caused by the interpenetration of the
two sufaces at the grain level. The process is driven by the strong tensile
stress field induced in the plane of the interface by the plastic deformation
in the normal direction. The grain boundaries of each joining surface yield to
host grains of the other surface, releasing this way the internally generated

group of all elliptic curves, when ordered by height, is 4. This implies that
the average rank of all elliptic curves, when ordered by height, is less than
1.17.
  Combining our counting techniques with a recent result of Dokchitser and
Dokchitser, we prove that a positive proportion of all elliptic curves have
rank 0. Assuming the finiteness of the Tate-Shafarevich group, we also show
that a positive proportion of elliptic curves have rank 1. Finally, combining
our counting results with the recent work of Skinner and Urban, we show that a
positive proportion of elliptic curves have analytic rank 0; i.e., a positive
proportion of elliptic curves have non-vanishing $L$-function at $s=1$. It
follows that a positive proportion of all elliptic curves satisfy BSD.

ribbons scan the sunspot at a speed of around 18 km/s, derived from Ca II and
G-band images. We find instantaneous horizontal shear of penumbral fibrils,
with initial velocities of about 1.6 km/s, produced when a flare ribbon passes
over them. This velocity decreases rapidly at first, then gradually decays, so
that about one hour later, the fibrils return to a new equilibrium. During the
one hour interval, the total displacement of these fibrils is around 2.0 Mm,
with an average shear velocity of 0.55 km/s. This lateral motion of the
penumbral fibrils indicates that the magnetic footpoints of these field lines

the beginning and the ending times of the intermediate regime exhibit power-law
dependence on concentration. The long-time and short-time diffusion
anisotropies change non-monotonically with concentration and reach minima in
the semi-dilute regime because the motions along long axes are caged at lower

coefficients change with time t as a linear function of (lnt)/t for the

indicates that their relaxation functions decay according to 1/t which provides
new challenges in theory. The effects of coupling between rotational and

appropriate to the proposed interaction conditions. A more detailed imaging
model derived from optical coherence theory and quantum electrodynamics is
shown to be far more tolerant of electronic damage. The nuclear density is
employed as the principal descriptor of molecular structure. The foundations of
the approach may also be used to characterize electrodynamical processes by
performing scattering experiments on complex molecules of known structure.

have also indicated that a pair of travelling waves generates immediately, by
nonlinear quadratic interactions, an unstable mean flow distortion, responsible
for rapid breakdown. By the use of functions quantifying the sensitivity of the
motion to deviations in the base flow, the 'optimal' travelling wave associated
to its specific defect is found by a variational approach. This optimal
solution is then integrated in time and shown to display a qualitative
similarity to the so-called 'minimal defect', for the same parameters. Finally,
numerical simulations of a 'edge state' are conducted, to identify an unstable
solution which mediates laminar-turbulent transition and relate it to results
of the optimisation procedure.

the group into subgroups, each maintaining its subgroup keys using Group

region-based approach, messages and key updates will be limited within subgroup

algorithms is to determine the convergence time, or the number of iterations
before the chain is close to stationarity. For many Markov chains used in

known to be polynomial, the theoretical bounds are often too crude to be
practical. Thus, practitioners like to carry out some form of statistical
analysis in order to assess convergence. This has led to the development of a
number of methods known as convergence diagnostics which attempt to diagnose
whether the Markov chain is far from stationarity. We study the problem of
testing convergence in the following settings and prove that the problem is
hard in a computational sense: Given a Markov chain that mixes rapidly, it is
hard for Statistical Zero Knowledge (SZK-hard) to distinguish whether starting
from a given state, the chain is close to stationarity by time t or far from

spintronics paradigm, which offers the perspective of reduced power
consumption, enabled by the decoupling of information processing from net
charge transfer. Spintronics also offers the possibility of devising hybrid
devices able to perform logic, communication, and storage operations. Graphene,
with its potentially long spin-coherence length, is a promising material for
spin-encoded information transport. However, the small spin-orbit interaction
is also a limitation for the design of conventional devices based on the
canonical Datta-Das spin-FET. An alternative solution can be found in magnetic
doping of graphene, or, as discussed in the present work, in exploiting the
proximity effect between graphene and Ferromagnetic Oxides (FOs). Graphene in
proximity to FO experiences an exchange proximity interaction (EPI), that acts
as an effective Zeeman field for electrons in graphene, inducing a spin
precession around the magnetization axis of the FO. Here we show that in an
appropriately designed double-gate field-effect transistor, with a bilayer
graphene channel and FO used as a gate dielectric, spin-precession of carriers
can be turned ON and OFF with the application of a differential voltage to the
gates. This feature is directly probed in the spin-resolved conductance of the

dephasing effects in interferometry based on single component BEC in double
potential wells, where two condensate modes may be involved. Results for both
two mode condensates and the simpler single mode condensate case are presented.
A hybrid phase space distribution functional method is used where the
condensate modes are described via a truncated Wigner representation, and the
basically unoccupied non-condensate modes are described via a positive P
representation. The Hamiltonian for the system is described in terms of quantum
field operators for the condensate and non-condensate modes. The functional
Fokker-Planck equation for the double phase space distribution functional is
derived. Equivalent Ito stochastic equations for the condensate and
non-condensate fields that replace the field operators are obtained, and
stochastic averages of products of these fields give the quantum correlation
functions used to interpret interferometry experiments. The stochastic field
equations are the sum of a deterministic term obtained from the drift vector in
the functional Fokker-Planck equation, and a noise field whose stochastic
properties are determined from the diffusion matrix in the functional
Fokker-Planck equation. The noise field stochastic properties are similar to
those for Gaussian-Markov processes in that the stochastic averages of odd
numbers of noise fields are zero and those for even numbers of noise field
terms are sums of products of stochastic averages associated with pairs of
noise fields. However each pair is represented by an element of the diffusion
matrix rather than products of the noise fields themselves. The treatment
starts from a generalised mean field theory for two condensate mode. The
generalized mean field theory solutions are needed for calculations using the
Ito stochastic field equations.

susceptible to reconstruction. The message channel being separate can be made
complex by linear combination of transmitter variable at different delay times
using mutiple delay systems. This method has the additional advantage that it
can be adjusted to be delay or anticipatory in synchronization and these
provide two additional basic keys that are independent of system delay.

respect to orientation and therefore suited to study orientation-dependent

galaxy spectrum shows a clear silicate absorption feature (tau_9.7mu = 1.1)

galaxy spectrum matches a dust-absorbed mean quasar spectrum in both shape and
overall flux level. The data for individual objects conform to these results.
The trend of the silicate depth to increase with decreasing core fraction of
the radio source further supports that for this sample, orientation is the main
driver for the difference between radio galaxies and quasars, as predicted by
AGN unification. However, comparing our high-z sample with lower redshift 3CRR

lower than expected from a scaled up version of lower luminosity sources, and

nonequilibrium coarsening dynamics of one-dimensional systems, we consider a
large class of ""hierarchical coalescence processes"" (HCP). An HCP consists of
an infinite sequence of coalescence processes ${\xi^{(n)}(\cdot)}_{n\ge1}$:
each process occurs in a different ""epoch"" (indexed by $n$) and evolves for an
infinite time, while the evolution in subsequent epochs are linked in such a
way that the initial distribution of $\xi^{(n+1)}$ coincides with the final
distribution of $\xi^{(n)}$. Inside each epoch the process, described by a
suitable simple point process representing the boundaries between adjacent
intervals (domains), evolves as follows. Only intervals whose length belongs to
a certain epoch-dependent finite range are active, that is, they can
incorporate their left or right neighboring interval with quite general rates.
Inactive intervals cannot incorporate their neighbors and can increase their
length only if they are incorporated by active neighbors. The activity ranges
are such that after a merging step the newly produced interval always becomes
inactive for that epoch but active for some future epoch. Without making any
mean-field assumption we show that: (i) if the initial distribution describes a
renewal process, then such a property is preserved at all later times and all
future epochs; (ii) the distribution of certain rescaled variables, for
example, the domain length, has a well-defined and universal limiting behavior
as $n\to \infty$ independent of the details of the process (merging rates,
activity ranges$,...$). This last result explains the universality in the
limiting behavior of several very different physical systems (e.g., the East
model of glassy dynamics or the Paste-all model) which was observed in several
simulations and analyzed in many physics papers. The main idea to obtain the
asymptotic result is to first write down a recursive set of nonlinear
identities for the Laplace transforms of the relevant quantities on different
epochs and then to solve it by means of a transformation which in some sense
linearizes the system.

consider both, isotropic and anisotropic light sources. In both cases, stable
orbits exist also for very sub-Keplerian rotation for which the radiation
pressure contributes substantially to the force budget. We demonstrate that
highly eccentric, very sub-Keplerian stable orbits may be found. This gives
further support for the model of Marconi et al. 2008, who pointed out that
black hole masses might be significantly underestimated if radiation pressure
is neglected. That model improved the agreement between black hole masses
derived in certain active galaxies based on BLR dynamics, and black hole masses
derived by other means in other galaxies by inclusion of a luminosity dependent
term. For anisotropic illumination, energy is conserved for averages over long
time intervals, only, but not for individual orbits. This leads to Rosetta
orbits that are systematically less extended in the direction of maximum
radiation force. Initially isotropic relatively low column density systems
would therefore turn into a disk when an anisotropic AGN is switched on.

experiments performed on ThGeO4 up to 40 GPa and total-energy
density-functional theory calculations. Zircon-type ThGeO4 is found to undergo
a pressure-driven phase transition at 11 GPa to the tetragonal scheelite
structure. A second phase transition to a monoclinic M-fergusonite type is
found beyond 26 GPa. The same transition has been observed in samples that
crystallize in the scheelite phase at ambient pressure. No additional phase
transition or evidence of decomposition of ThGeO4 has been detected up to 40
GPa. The unit-cell parameters of the monoclinic high-pressure phase are a =
4.98(2) A, b = 11.08(4) A, c = 4.87(2) A, and beta = 90.1(1), Z = 4 at 28.8
GPa. The scheelite-fergusonite transition is reversible and the
zircon-scheelite transition non-reversible. From the experiments and the
calculations, the room temperature equation of state for the different phases
is also obtained. The anisotropic compressibility of the studied crystal is
discussed in terms of the differential compressibility of the Th-O and Ge-O
bonds.

The cascade initiates from a metastable biexciton state in which the holes form
a spin-triplet configuration, Pauli-blockaded from relaxation to the

decay paths. Unlike in the singlet-ground state biexciton radiative cascade, in
which the two photons are co-linearly polarized, in the triplet biexciton

polarization density matrix and show that the phonon emitted when the
intermediate exciton relaxes from excited to ground state, preserves the
exciton's spin. The phonon, thus, does not carry with it any which-path
information other than its energy. Nevertheless, entanglement distillation by
spectral filtering was found to be rather ineffective for this cascade. This
deficiency results from the opposite sign of the anisotropic electron-hole

the pulsar experienced a continuous sequence of 12 slow glitches with a
fractional increase in the rotation frequency Deltanu/nu=1.5x10^{-9}. All the
slow glitches observed have a similar signature related to a slow increase in
the rotation frequency during 200 days and the subsequent relaxation back to
the pre-glitch value during 400 days. We show that a continuous sequence of
such slow glitches is characterized by practically identical amplitudes equal
to Deltanu=3.5x10^{-9} Hz and identical time intervals between glitches of
about 600 days and is well described by a periodic sawtooth-like function. The
detection of two different phenomena, such as a large glitch and a sequence of
slow glitches, indicates the presence of two types of discontinuities in the
rotation frequency of the pulsar B0919+06. These discontinuities can be
classified as normal and slow glitches.

key challenge here is to select channels providing a good tradeoff between
connectivity and contention. In other words, channels with good opportunities
for communication due to (1) low primary radio nodes (PRs) activities, and (2)
limited contention of cognitive ratio nodes (CRs) acceding that channel, have
to be selected. Thus, by dynamically exploring residual resources on channels
and by monitoring the number of CRs on a particular channel, SURF allows
building a connected network with limited contention where reliable
communication can take place. Through simulations, we study the performance of
SURF when compared with three other related approaches. Simulation results
confirm that our approach is effective in selecting the best channels for
efficient and reliable multi-hop data dissemination.

aim is to derive, from observational data, information on the present (10-15
yrs after the outburst) nature and structure of the object. We present and
analyse a high-resolution (R = 21 000) spectrum of V4332 Sgr obtained with the
Subaru Telescope in June 2009. Various components (stellar-like continuum,
atomic emission lines, molecular bands in emission) in the spectrum are
analysed and discussed. We also investigate a global spectral energy
distribution (SED) of the object mostly derived from broadband optical and
infrared photometry. The observed continuum resembles that of an M6 giant. The
emission features (atomic and molecular) are most probably produced by
radiative pumping. The observed strengths of the emission features strongly
suggest that we only observe a small part of the radiation of the main object
responsible for pumping the emission features. An infrared component seen in
the observed SED, which can be roughly approximated by two blackbodies of 950
and 200 K, is 50 times brighter than the M6 stellar component seen in the
optical. This further supports the idea that the main object is mostly obscured
for us. The main object in V4332 Sgr, an M6 (super)giant, is surrounded by a
circumstellar disc, which is seen almost edge-on so the central star is
obscured. The observed M6 spectrum probably results from scattering the central
star spectrum on dust grains at the outer edge of the disc.

coexistence between two states towards a multi-domain configuration. A second

  over the naturals","To appear in Proc. of the 10th International Conference on Artificial
  Intelligence and Symbolic Computation, AISC'10",,,,"cs.SC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Matrix interpretations generalize linear polynomial interpretations and have
been proved useful in the implementation of tools for automatically proving
termination of Term Rewriting Systems. In view of the successful use of
rational coefficients in polynomial interpretations, we have recently
generalized traditional matrix interpretations (using natural numbers in the
matrix entries) to incorporate real numbers. However, existing results which
formally prove that polynomials over the reals are more powerful than
polynomials over the naturals for proving termination of rewrite systems failed
to be extended to matrix interpretations. In this paper we get deeper into this
problem. We show that, under some conditions, it is possible to transform a
matrix interpretation over the rationals satisfying a set of symbolic
constraints into a matrix interpretation over the naturals (using bigger
matrices) which still satisfies the constraints.

and control theoretic perspective. Pricing mechanisms are used as a design tool
to ensure that the Nash equilibrium of a fairly general class of noncooperative
games satisfies certain global objectives such as welfare maximization or
achieving a certain level of quality-of-service (QoS). The class of games
considered provide a theoretical basis for decentralized resource allocation
and control problems including network congestion control, wireless uplink
power control, and optical power control. The game design problem is analyzed
under different knowledge assumptions (full versus limited information) and
design objectives (QoS versus utility maximization) for separable and
non-separable utility functions. The ``price of anarchy'' is shown not to be an
inherent feature of full-information games that incorporate pricing mechanisms.
Moreover, a simple linear pricing is shown to be sufficient for design of Nash
equilibrium according to a chosen global objective for a fairly general class
of games. Stability properties of the game and pricing dynamics are studied
under the assumption of time-scale separation and in two separate time-scales.
Thus, sufficient conditions are derived, which allow the designer to place the
Nash equilibrium solution or to guide the system trajectory to a desired region
or point. The obtained results are illustrated with a number of examples.

were combined with stellar and planetary parameters, for a unique sample of 147
stars, amounting to 184 extrasolar planets, including 25 multiple systems.
Indeed, for the present working sample we considered only stars with planets
detected by the radial-velocity procedure. Our analysis shows that the v sin i
distribution of stars with planets along the HR Diagram follows the well
established scenario for the rotation of intermediate to low main sequence
stars, with a sudden decline in rotation near 1.2Msun . The decline occurs
around Teff~ 6000 K, corresponding to the late-F spectral region. A statistical
comparison of the distribution of the rotation of stars with planets and a
sample of stars without planets indicates that the v sin i distribution for
these two families of stars is drawn from the same population distribution
function. We also found that the angular momentum of extrasolar planet parent
stars follows, at least qualitatively, Kraft's relation. The stars without
detected planets show a clear trend of angular momentum deficit compared to the
stars with planets, in particular for masses higher than about 1.25 Msun .
Stars with the largest mass planets tend to have angular momentum comparable to
or higher than the Sun.

evidenced by the rapid release of entropy below Tc from our electronic specific
heat measurements. Above 2K the electronic specific heat exhibits the power law
behavior, suggesting that synthesis of single crystals and measurements at
lower temperature are needed to establish whether the gap is anisotropic. The

energy in an oceanic basin with arbitrary topography. For illustration, we
consider a rectangular basin and a linear topography h=by which represents
either a real bottom topography or the beta-effect appropriate to oceanic
situations. Our minimum enstrophy principle is motivated by different arguments
of statistical mechanics reviewed in the article. It leads to steady states of
the quasigeostrophic (QG) equations characterized by a linear relationship
between potential vorticity q and stream function psi. For low values of the
energy, we recover Fofonoff flows [J. Mar. Res. 13, 254 (1954)] that display a
strong westward jet. For large values of the energy, we obtain geometry induced
phase transitions between monopoles and dipoles similar to those found by
Chavanis and Sommeria [J. Fluid Mech. 314, 267 (1996)] in the absence of
topography. In the presence of topography, we recover and confirm the results
obtained by Venaille and Bouchet [Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 104501 (2009)] using a
different formalism. In addition, we introduce relaxation equations towards
minimum potential enstrophy states and perform numerical simulations to
illustrate the phase transitions in a rectangular oceanic basin with linear

formation and evolution of galactic, gas-rich disks forming from gas infall
within dark matter halos. The temperature and density structure of the gas is
varied in order to differentiate between (i) simultaneous gas infall at a large
range of radii and (ii) the inside-out build-up of a disk. In all cases, the
disks go through phases of ring formation, gravitational instability and
break-up into massive clumps. Ring formation can be enhanced by a focal point
effect. The position of the ring is determined by the angular momentum
distribution of the material it forms from. We study the ring and clump
morphologies, the characteristic properties of the resulting velocity
dispersion field and the effect of star formation. In the early phases, gas
accretion leads to a high vertical velocity dispersion. We find that the disk
fragmentation by gravitational instability and the subsequent clump-clump
interactions drive high velocity dispersions mainly in the plane of the disk
while at the same time the vertical velocity dispersion dissipates. The result
is a strong variation of the line-of-sight velocity dispersion with inclination
angle. For a face-on view, clumps appear as minima in the (vertical)
dispersion, whereas for a more edge-on view, they tend to correspond to maxima.
There exists observational evidence of a systematic variation of the velocity
dispersion with inclination angle in high-redshift disks, which could be partly
explained by our simulation results. Additional energetic sources to drive
velocity dispersion that are not included in our models are also expected to
contribute to the observational results.

classification of isolated hypersurface singularities in positive

real an complex hypersurfaces in the 1970's with respect to right equivalence,
several new phenomena occur in positive characteristic. Already the notion of
isolated singularity is different for right resp. contact equivalence over
fields of characteristic other than zero. The heart of this paper consists of
the study of different notions of non-degeneracy and the associated piecewise
filtrations induced by the Newton diagram of a power series f. We introduce the
conditions AC and AAC which modify and generalise the conditions A and AA of
Arnol'd resp. Wall and which allow the classification with respect to contact
equivalence in any characteristic. Using this we deduce normal forms and rather
sharp determinacy bounds for f with respect to right and contact equivalence.

models are associated with synchrotron and SSC emission of highly relativistic
electrons. In some sources the SSC component dominates the synchrotron peak by
one or more orders of magnitude implying that the electrons mainly cool by
inverse Compton collisions with their self-made synchrotron photons. Therefore,
the linear synchrotron loss of electrons, which is normally invoked in emission
models, has to be replaced by a nonlinear loss rate depending on an energy
integral of the electron distribution. This modified electron cooling changes
significantly the emerging radiation spectra. It is the purpose of this work to
apply this new cooling scenario to relativistic power-law distributed
electrons, which are injected instantaneously into the jet. We will first solve
the differential equation of the volume-averaged differential number density of
the electrons, and then discuss their temporal evolution. Since any non-linear
cooling will turn into linear cooling after some time, we also calculated the
electron number density for a combined cooling scenario consisting of both the
linear and non-linear cooling. For all cases, we will also calculate
analytically the emerging optically thin synchrotron fluence spectrum which
will be compared to a numerical solution. For small normalized frequencies f <
1 the fluence spectra show constant spectral indices. We find for linear
cooling a_SYN = 1/2, and for non-linear cooling a_SSC = 3/2. In the combined
cooling scenario we obtain for the small injection parameter b_1 = 1/2, and for
the large injection parameter b_2 = 3/2, which becomes b_1 = 1/2 for very small
frequencies, again. This is the same behaviour as for monoenergetically
injected electrons.

final microstructure of particle-stabilised emulsions formed via demixing in a

relies on structure factors obtained from discrete Fourier transforms of
individual frames in confocal image sequences. Radially averaging the squared
modulus of these Fourier transforms before peak fitting allows extraction of
dominant length scales over the entire temperature range of the quench. Our
procedure even yields information just after droplet nucleation, when the
(fluorescence) contrast between the two separating phases is scarcely
discernable in the images. We find that our emulsions are stabilised on
experimental time scales by interfacial particles and that they are likely to
have bimodal droplet-size distributions. We attribute the latter to coalescence
together with creaming being the main coarsening mechanism during the late
stages of emulsification and we support this claim with (direct)
confocal-microscopy observations. In addition, our results imply that the
observed droplets emerge from particle-promoted nucleation, possibly followed
by a free-growth regime. Finally, we argue that creaming strongly affects
droplet growth during the early stages of emulsification. Future investigations
could clarify the link between quench conditions and resulting microstructure,
paving the way for tailor-made particle-stabilised emulsions from binary

traffic interference based Load Balancing Routing (LBR) protocol and Min-Max
Battery Cost Routing (MMBCR) as representatives of the stability-based routing,
load-balancing and power-aware routing protocols respectively. Among the three
routing protocols, FORP incurs the least number of route transitions; while LBR
incurs the smallest hop count and lowest end-to-end delay per data packet.
Energy consumed per node is the least for MMBCR, closely followed by LBR. MMBCR
is the most fair in terms of node usage and hence it incurs the largest time
for first node failure. FORP tends to repeatedly use nodes lying on the stable
path and hence is the most unfair of the three routing protocols and it incurs
the smallest value for the time of first node failure. As we measure the
failure times of up to the first five nodes in the network, we observe that LBR
incurs the maximum improvement in the lifetime of the nodes and MMBCR incurs
the least improvement beyond the time of first node failure.

the iris of their eye, has become popular in security applications because of
its ease of use, accuracy, and safety in controlling access to high-security
areas. Fusion of multiple algorithms for biometric verification performance
improvement has received considerable attention. The proposed method combines
the zero-crossing 1 D wavelet Euler number, and genetic algorithm based for
feature extraction. The output from these three algorithms is normalized and
their score are fused to decide whether the user is genuine or imposter. This
new strategies is discussed in this paper, in order to compute a multimodal
combined score.

  1, No 1 (2010)",,,"cs.NI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","  Security and Privacy are two important parameters that need to be considered
when dealing with wireless sensor networks as WSN operate in an unattended
environment and carry sensitive information critical to the application.
However, applying security techniques that consume minimum resources is still a
challenge and this paper makes an attempt to address the same. One of the major
attacks in sensor network is denial of service attack that not only diminishes
the network capacity but also affects the reliability of information being
transmitted. This work is an extension of our previous work which could
successfully detect DDoS using ants. However, no emphasis was made towards the
prevention mechanism. In this paper an ant-based framework that exploits the
significance of stateless and stateful signatures and hence preserving the
legtimate packets only, thereby discarding the contaminated packets has been
proposed.

images.The proposed technique converts 4 bit image into 4 shaded Gray Scale
image. This image will be act as reference image to hide the text. Using this
grey scale reference image any text can be hidden. Single character of a text
can be represented by 8-bit. The 8-bit character can be split into 4X2 bit
information. If the reference image and the data file are transmitted through
network separately, we can achieve the effect of Steganography. Here the image
is not at all distorted because said image is only used for referencing. Any
huge mount of text material can be hidden using a very small image. Decipher
the text is not possible intercepting the image or data file separately. So, it
is more secure.
