the galaxy cluster population, one that is complementary to X-ray surveys. To
better understand the relation between these two kinds of survey, we construct
an empirical cluster model using scaling relations constrained by current X-ray
and SZ data. We apply our model to predict the X-ray properties of the Planck
SZ Cluster Catalog (PCC) and compare them to existing X-ray cluster catalogs.
We find that Planck should significantly extend the depth of the previous
all-sky cluster survey, performed in the early 1990s by the ROSAT satellite,
and should be particularly effective at finding hot, massive clusters (T > 6
keV) out to redshift unity. These are rare objects, and our findings suggest
that Planck could increase the observational sample at z > 0.6 by an order of
magnitude. This would open the way for detailed studies of massive clusters out
to these higher redshifts. Specifically, we find that the majority of
newly-detected Planck clusters should have X-ray fluxes 10^{-13} ergs/s/cm^2 <
f_X[0.5-2 keV] < 10^{-12} ergs/s/cm^2, i.e., distributed over the decade in
flux just below the ROSAT All Sky Survey limit. This is sufficiently bright for
extensive X-ray follow-up campaigns. Once Planck finds these objects,
XMM-Newton and \textit{Chandra} could measure temperatures to 10% for a sample
of ~ 100 clusters in the range 0.5 < z < 1, a valuable increase in the number
of massive clusters studied over this range.

referred to as FATS (Faculty Attitudes Toward Statistics). Data were obtained
from 227 instructors (USA and international), and analyzed using factor
analysis, multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis. The
overall scale consists of five sub-scales with a total of 25 items, and an
overall alpha of 0.89. Construct validity was established. Specifically, the
overall scale, and subscales (except perceived difficulty) plausibly
differentiated between low-reform and high-reform practice instructors.
Statistically significant differences in attitude were observed with respect to
age, but not gender, employment status, membership status in professional
organizations, ethnicity, highest academic qualification, and degree
concentration. This scale can be considered a reliable and valid measure of
instructors' attitudes toward reform-oriented (concept-based or constructivist)

Additional studies are required to confirm these structural and psychometric
properties.

simulations of impacts between differentiated water(ice)-rock planets with
masses between 0.5 and 5 M_Earth and projectile to target mass ratios from 1:1

decrease the bulk density of the target planet. If the commonly assumed maximum
water fraction of 75wt% for bodies forming beyond the snow line is correct,
giant impacts between similar composition bodies cannot serve as a mechanism
for increasing the water fraction. Target planets either accrete materials in
the same proportion, leaving the water fraction unchanged, or lose material
from the water mantle, decreasing the water fraction. The criteria for
catastrophic disruption of water-rock planets are similar to those found in
previous work on super-Earths of terrestrial composition. Changes in bulk
composition for giant impacts onto differentiated bodies of any composition
(water-rock or rock-iron) are described by the same equations. These general
laws can be incorporated into future N-body calculations of planet formation to
track changes in composition from giant impacts.

the sense that any suitably generic element of $ \widetilde{\text {Ham}}(M,
\omega)$ is connected to $id$ by a generalized path minimizing spectral length.
Rather strong evidence is given for this when $M=S ^{2}$, where we show that
all the Lalonde-McDuff Hamiltonian symplectomorphisms are joined to id by such
a path. We also prove that the associated norm on $ {\text {Ham}}(M, \omega)$
is non-degenerate and bounded from below by the the spectral norm. If the
spectral length functional is variationally complete the associated norm
reduces to the spectral norm.

effective actions, vacuum energies, and spectral counting functions and discuss
the application of this approach in some physical problems. Concretely, we
construct the equations for these three quantities; this allows us to achieve
them by directly solving equations. In order to construct the equations, we
introduce shifted local one-loop effective actions, shifted local vacuum
energies, and local spectral counting functions. We solve the equations of
one-loop effective actions, vacuum energies, and spectral counting functions
for free massive scalar fields in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, scalar fields in
three-dimensional hyperbolic space $H_{3}$ (the Euclidean Anti-de Sitter space
$AdS_{3}$), in $H_{3}/Z$ (the geometry of the Euclidean BTZ black hole), and in
$S^{1}$, and the Higgs model in a $(1+1)$-dimensional finite interval.
Moreover, in the above cases, we also calculate the spectra from the counting
functions. Besides exact solutions, we give a general discussion on approximate
solutions and construct the general series expansion for one-loop effective
actions, vacuum energies, and spectral counting functions. In doing this, we
encounter divergences. In order to remove the divergences, renormalization
procedures are used. In this approach, these three physical quantities are
regarded as spectral functions in the spectral problem.

difficulty understanding and applying statistical concepts. The predominant
focus of reform has been on content, pedagogy, technology and assessment, with
little attention to instructor characteristics. However, there is strong
theoretical and empirical evidence that instructors' attitudes impact the
quality of teaching and learning. The objective of this study was to develop
and initially validate a scale to measure instructors' attitudes toward
reform-oriented (or concept-based) teaching of introductory statistics in the
health and behavioral sciences, at the tertiary level. This scale will be
referred to as FATS (Faculty Attitudes Toward Statistics). Data were obtained
from 227 instructors (USA and international), and analyzed using factor
analysis, multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis. The
overall scale consists of five sub-scales with a total of 25 items, and an
overall alpha of 0.89. Construct validity was established. Specifically, the
overall scale, and subscales (except perceived difficulty) plausibly
differentiated between low-reform and high-reform practice instructors.
Statistically significant differences in attitude were observed with respect to
age, but not gender, employment status, membership status in professional
organizations, ethnicity, highest academic qualification, and degree
concentration. This scale can be considered a reliable and valid measure of
instructors' attitudes toward reform-oriented (concept-based or constructivist)
teaching of introductory statistics in the health and behavioral sciences at
the tertiary level. These five dimensions influence instructors' attitudes.
Additional studies are required to confirm these structural and psychometric
properties.

localized along soliton trajectories.
  Examples are presented of how, with the aid of local special polynomials, one
can modify equations that have only a single-soliton solution into ones, which
have that solution as well as, at least, a two-solitons solutions.
  Given an integrable equation, with the aid of local special polynomials, it
is possible to find all evolution equations in higher scaling weights, which
share the same single-soliton solution and are either integrable, or, at least,
have a two-solitons solution. This is demonstrated for one or two consecutive
scaling weights for a number of known equations.
  In the study of perturbed integrable equations, local special polynomials are
responsible for inelastic soliton interactions generated by the perturbation in
the multiple-soliton case, and for the (possible) loss of asymptotic
integrability. Non-local special polynomials describe higher-order corrections
to the solution, which are of an inelastic nature.

two interacting populations, namely; extrovert ($a$) and introvert ($b$). In
our model, each group is characterized by its size ($N_a$ and $N_b$) and
preferred degree ($\kappa_a$ and $\kappa_b\ll\kappa_a$). The network dynamics
is governed by the competing microscopic rules of each population that consist
of the creation and destruction of links. Starting from an unconnected network,
we give a detailed analysis of the mean field approach which is compared to
Monte Carlo simulation data. The time evolution of the restricted degrees
$\moyenne{k_{bb}}$ and $\moyenne{k_{ab}}$ presents three time regimes and a non
monotonic behavior well captured by our theory. Surprisingly, when the
population size are equal $N_a=N_b$, the ratio of the restricted degree
$\theta_0=\moyenne{k_{ab}}/\moyenne{k_{bb}}$ appears to be an integer in the
asymptotic limits of the three time regimes. For early times (defined by
$t<t_1=\kappa_b$) the total number of links presents a linear evolution, where
the two populations are indistinguishable and where $\theta_0=1$.
Interestingly, in the intermediate time regime (defined for
$t_1<t<t_2\propto\kappa_a$ and for which $\theta_0=5$), the system reaches a
transient stationary state, where the number of contacts among introverts
remains constant while the number of connections is increasing linearly in the
extrovert population. Finally, due to the competing dynamics, the network
presents a frustrated stationary state characterized by a ratio $\theta_0=3$.

On the one hand, we propose
a new definition in order to compute the fractal dimension of a subset respect
to any fractal structure, which completes the theory of classical box-counting
dimension. Indeed, if we select the so called natural fractal structure on each
euclidean space, then we will get the box-counting dimension as a particular
case. Recall that box-counting dimension could be calculated over any euclidean
space, although it can be defined over any metrizable one. Nevertheless, the
new definition we present can be computed on an easy way over any space
admitting a fractal structure. Thus, since a space is metrizable if and only if
it supports a starbase fractal structure, our model allows to classify and
distinguish a much larger number of topological spaces than the classical
definition. On the other hand, our aim consists also of studying some
applications of effective calculation of the fractal dimension over a kind of
contexts where the box-counting dimension has no sense, like the domain of
words, which appears when modeling the streams of information in Kahn's
parallel computation model. In this way, we show how to calculate and
understand the fractal dimension value obtained for a language generated by
means of a regular expression, and also we pay attention to an empirical and
novel application of fractal dimension to natural languages.

the effects of dispersion in the CNOT circuit can be mitigated by augmenting it

of particles torn from their progenitors during the process of hierarchical

effective radius (R_e), and effective surface brightness (I_e), early-type
galaxies are observed to populate a two-dimensional fundamental plane (FP) with
finite thickness. In Paper III of this series, we showed that the thickness of
the FP is predominantly due to variations in the stellar mass surface density
(Sigma_*) inside the effective radius R_e. These variations represent
differences in the dark matter fraction inside R_e (or possibly differences in
the initial mass function) from galaxy to galaxy. This means that galaxies do
not wind up below the FP at lower surface brightness due to the passive fading
of their stellar populations; they are structurally different. Here, we show
that these variations in Sigma_* at fixed dynamical mass (M_dyn) are linked to
differences in the galaxy stellar populations, and therefore to differences in
their star formation histories. We demonstrate that the ensemble of stellar
population and Sigma_* variations through the FP thickness can be explained by
a model in which early-type galaxies at fixed M_dyn have their star formation
truncated at different times. The thickness of the FP can therefore be
interpreted as a sequence of truncation times. Galaxies below the FP have
earlier truncation times for a given M_dyn, resulting in lower Sigma_*, older
ages, lower metallicities in both [Fe/H] and [Mg/H], and higher [Mg/Fe]. We
show that this model is quantitatively consistent with simple expectations for
chemical enrichment in galaxies. We also present fitting functions for
luminosity-weighted age, [Fe/H], [Mg/H], and [Mg/Fe] as functions of the FP
parameters velocity dispersion, R_e, and I_e. These provide a new tool for
estimating the stellar population properties of quiescent early-type galaxies

molecules will be directly observable; light diatomic hydrides and their ions
(CH, OH, SH, NH, CH+, OH+, SH+, NH+). These simple constituents are important
both for the chemical evolution of the region and as tracers of high-energy
radiation. If outflows of a forming star erode cavities in the envelope,
protostellar far UV (FUV; 6 < E_gamma < 13.6 eV) radiation may escape through
such low-density regions. Depending on the shape of the cavity, the FUV
radiation then irradiates the quiescent envelope in the walls along the
outflow. The chemical composition in these outflow walls is altered by
photoreactions and heating via FUV photons in a manner similar to photo
dominated regions (PDRs).
  In this work, we study the effect of cavity shapes, outflow density, and of a
disk with the two-dimensional chemical model of a high-mass young stellar
object introduced in the second paper in this series.
  We find that the shape of the cavity is particularly important in the
innermost part of the envelope, where the dust temperatures are high enough (>
100 K) for water ice to evaporate. If the cavity shape allows FUV radiation to
penetrate this hot-core region, the abundance of FUV destroyed species (e.g.
water) is decreased. In particular, diatomic hydrides and their ions CH$+, OH+
and NH+ are enhanced by many orders of magnitude in the outflow walls due to
the combination of high gas temperatures and rapid photodissociation of more
saturated species. The enhancement of these diatomic hydrides is sufficient for
a detection using the HIFI and PACS instruments onboard Herschel. The effect of
X-ray ionization on the chemistry is found to be small, due to the much larger
luminosity in FUV bands compared to X-rays.

The DLAs with log (HI column density) > 20.3 show the same redshift evolution
as the LLS. When combined with previous results, our DLA sample is also
consistent with a constant Omega_DLA= 9 x 10^(-4) from z = 2 to z = 5. We have
used the LLS number density evolution to compute the evolution in the mean free

more massive and dominant galaxy clusters. These facts indicate that the host
galaxy cluster has played an important role in the formation of their BCGs. We

GMCs hosting the most luminous clusters are being disrupted by those clusters.
Accordingly, we interpret the range in epsilon_ff as the result of a
time-variable star formation rate; the rate of star formation increases with
the age of the host molecular cloud, until the stars disrupt the cloud. These
results are inconsistent with the notion that the star formation rate in Milky
Way GMCs is determined by the properties of supersonic turbulence

GALEX Arecibo SDSS Survey, which show this galaxy to be in a remarkable
evolutionary state. UGC8802 (GASS35981) is a disk galaxy with stellar mass
M*=2x10^10 Msolar which appears to contain an additional 2.1x10^10 Msolar of HI
gas. New millimeter observations with the IRAM 30m telescope indicate a
molecular gas mass only a tenth this large. Using deep long-slit spectroscopy,
we examine the spatially resolved star formation rate and metallicity profiles
of GASS35981 for clues to its history. We find that the star formation surface
density in this galaxy is low (Sigma_SFR=0.003 Msolar/yr/kpc^2) and that the
star formation is spread remarkably evenly across the galaxy. The low molecular
gas masses measured in our three IRAM pointings are largely consistent with the
total star formation measured within the same apertures. Our MMT long-slit
spectrum reveals a sharp drop in metallicity in the outer disk of GASS35981.
The ratio of current star formation rate to existing stellar mass surface
density in the outer disk is extremely high, implying that all the stars must
have formed within the past ~1Gyr. At current star formation rates, however,
GASS35981 will not consume its HI reservoir for another 5-7 Gyr. Despite its
exceptionally large gas fraction for a galaxy this massive, GASS35981 has a
regular rotation curve and exhibits no sign of a recent interaction or merger.
We speculate that GASS35981 may have acquired its gas directly from the
inter-galactic medium, and that it and other similar galaxies identified in the
GASS survey may provide rare local glimpses of gas accretion processes that
were more common during the prime epoch of disk galaxy formation at z~1.

the current Universe is in the form of high temperature, highly ionized plasma
emitting and absorbing primarily in the soft X-ray and UV bands, dubbed the
Warm-Hot Intergalactic Medium (WHIM). Its signature should be observable in
red-shifted emission and absorption lines from highly ionized elements. To
determine the expected WHIM emission in the soft X-ray band we used the output
of a large scale hydrodynamic SPH simulation to generate images and spectra
with angular resolution of 14'' and energy resolution of 1 eV. The current
biggest limit of any hydrodynamic simulation in predicting the X-ray emission
comes from metal diffusion. In our investigation, by using four different
models for the WHIM metallicity we have found a strong dependence of the
emission on the model used, with differences up to almost an order of
magnitude. For each model we have investigated the redshift distribution and
angular scale of the emission, confirming that most photons come from redshift
z<1.2 and that the emission has a typical angular scale of less than a few
arcminutes. We also compared our simulations with the few currently available
observations and found that, within the variation of the metallicity models,
our predictions are in good agreement with current constraints on the WHIM
emission, and at this time the weak experimental constraints on the WHIM
emission are not sufficient to exclude any of the models used.

polarization (DOP) dependence on the in-plane dimensions of investigated

influence of the out-of plane dimension. The energy dependence modeling reveals
the importance of different excited states in subsequent spectral ranges
leading to non-monotonic character of the DOP. The modeling results show good

Lefschetz fibration on such a variety and a finite set of primes, the main new
tool is a method, which we call homologous recombination, for constructing a
Lefschetz fibration whose total space is smoothly equivalent to the original
variety, but for which symplectic cohomology with coefficients in the given set
of primes vanishes (there is also a simpler version that kills symplectic
cohomology completely). Rather than relying on a geometric analysis of periodic
orbits of a flow, the computation of symplectic cohomology depends on
describing the Fukaya category associated to the new fibration. As a
consequence of this and a result of McLean we prove, for example, that an
affine variety of real dimension greater than 4 supports infinitely many
different (Wein)stein structures of finite type, and, assuming a mild
cohomological condition, uncountably many different ones of infinite type. In
addition, we introduce a notion of complexity which measures the number of
handle attachments required to construct a given Weinstein manifold, and prove
that, in dimensions greater than or equal to 12, one may ensure that the

nearest-neighbor sites of the Cu lattice in which the superconductivity is
believed to primarily reside and m labels the site at the center of the bond

Delta_m^4/2)+C sum_<mn> Delta_m Delta_n cos(phi_m-phi_n), for the functional.
The coefficients A, B and C are determined from comparison with experiments. We
work out a number of consequences of the proposed functional for specific
choices of A, B and C as functions of hole density x and temperature T. There
can be a rapid crossover of <Delta_m> from small to large values as A changes
sign on lowering T and the crossover temperatures is identified with the
observed pseudogap temperature. The superconducting phase-coherence transition
occurs at a different temperature T_c, and describes superconductivity with
d-wave symmetry for C>0. We calculate T_c(x) which has the observed parabolic
shape, being strongly influenced by the coupling between Delta_m and phi_m
present in F. The superfluid density, the local gap magnitude, the specific
heat (with and without a magnetic field) and vortex properties are obtained
using F. We compare our results successfully with experiments. We also obtain
the electron spectral density as influenced by the coupling between the
electrons and the pair correlation function calculated from F. Features such as
temperature dependent Fermi arcs, antinodal pseudogap filling temperature,
pseudogapped density of states in different momentum regions of the Fermi

dissipation mechanism which has to be taken into account in the models of
formation of relativistic magnetized gamma-ray burst (GRB) outflows from the
newborn black holes and/or magnetars. We show that if the GRB outflow is proton
loaded, spectral energy distribution of this emission is expected to sharply
peak in 0.1-1~MeV energy band. If the small pitch angle synchrotron emission
efficiently cools relativistic particles of the outflow, its spectrum below the
peak energy is a powerlaw with spectral index alpha ~ -1, close to the typical
spectral index of the time-resolved GRB spectra. Otherwise, the low energy
spectral index can be as hard as alpha ~ 0, as observed at the beginning of the
GRB pulses. We make a conjecture that small pitch angle synchrotron emission
from proton-loaded magnetized GRB outflow could significantly contribute to the
Band component of the prompt emission of GRBs while electromagnetic cascade
initiated by the protons could be responsible for the GeV component.

systematic search for young massive stars which has returned a large, well
selected sample of such objects. The mean luminosity of the sample is
approximately 5 times 10^4 L_\odot, indicating the objects typically have a
mass of ~15 solar masses. We fit the observed bandhead profiles with a model of
a circumstellar disc, and find good agreement between the models and
observations for all but one object. We compare the high angular precision
(0.2-0.8 mas) spectroastrometric data to the spatial distribution of the
emitting material in the best-fitting models. No spatial signatures of discs
are detected, which is entirely consistent with the properties of the
best-fitting models. Therefore, the observations suggest that the CO bandhead
emission of massive young stellar objects originates in small-scale disks, in
agreement with previous work. This provides further evidence that massive stars
form via disc accretion, as suggested by recent simulations.

a series of papers published during the past decade with respect to M\""ossbauer

that the relative energy shift {\Delta}E/E between the source of resonant
radiation (situated at the center of the rotating system) and the resonant
absorber (located on the rotor rim) is described by the relationship
${\Delta}E/E=-ku^2/c^2$, where u is the tangential velocity of the absorber, c
the velocity of light in vacuum, and k some coefficient, which -- contrary to
what had been classically predicted equal 1/2 (see for example [35]) -- turns
out to be substantially larger than 1/2. It cannot be stressed enough that the
equality $k=1/2$ had been predicted by general theory of relativity (GTR) on
account of the special relativistic time dilation effect delineated by the
tangential displacement of the rotating absorber, where the ""clock hypothesis""
by Einstein (i.e., the non-reliance of the time rate of any clock on its
acceleration [35]) was straightly adopted. Hence, the revealed inequality
$k>1/2$ indicates the presence of some additional energy shift (next to the
usual time dilation effect arising from tangential displacement alone) between
the emitted and absorbed resonant radiation. By using Bimetric Theory of
Gravitational-Inertial Field [76] we obtain $k=0.75$ in a good agreement with
experimental result $k=0.69+(-)0.03$ [75].

CSPs in the bounded-degree model.
  First, for any ``symmetric'' predicate $P:{0,1}^{k} \to {0,1}$ except \equ
where $k\geq 3$, we show that every (randomized) algorithm that distinguishes
satisfiable instances of CSP(P) from instances $(|P^{-1}(0)|/2^k-\epsilon)$-far
from satisfiability requires $\Omega(n^{1/2+\delta})$ queries where $n$ is the
number of variables and $\delta>0$ is a constant that depends on $P$ and
$\epsilon$. This breaks a natural lower bound $\Omega(n^{1/2})$, which is
obtained by the birthday paradox. We also show that every one-sided error
tester requires $\Omega(n)$ queries for such $P$. These results are hereditary
in the sense that the same results hold for any predicate $Q$ such that
$P^{-1}(1) \subseteq Q^{-1}(1)$. For EQU, we give a one-sided error tester
whose query complexity is $\tilde{O}(n^{1/2})$. Also, for 2-XOR (or,
equivalently E2LIN2), we show an $\Omega(n^{1/2+\delta})$ lower bound for
distinguishing instances between $\epsilon$-close to and $(1/2-\epsilon)$-far
from satisfiability.
  Next, for the general k-CSP over the binary domain, we show that every

$(1-2k/2^k-\epsilon)$-far from satisfiability requires $\Omega(n)$ queries. The
matching NP-hardness is not known, even assuming the Unique Games Conjecture or

approximation algorithm within a factor $d/\poly\log d$ and an additive error
of $\epsilon n$ requires $\Omega(n)$ queries. Previously, only super-constant

investigate these irregularities as a function of the environment (cluster

consists of 92 distant galaxies. 16 cluster (z~0.3 and z~0.5) and 29 field
galaxies (mean z=0.44) of these have velocity fields with sufficient signal to
be analyzed. We find that the fraction of galaxies that have irregular gas
kinematics is remarkably similar in galaxy clusters and in the field at
intermediate redshifts. The distribution of the field and cluster galaxies in
(ir)regularity parameters space is also similar. On the other hand galaxies
with small central concentration of light, that we see in the field sample, are
absent in the cluster sample. We find that field galaxies at intermediate
redshifts have more irregular velocity fields as well as more clumpy and less
centrally concentrated light distributions than their local counterparts.
Comparison with a SINS sample of 11 z ~ 2 galaxies shows that these distant
galaxies have more irregular gas kinematics than our intermediate redshift
cluster and field sample. We do not find a dependence of the irregularities in
gas kinematics on morphological type. We find that two different indicators of
star formation correlate with irregularity in the gas kinematics. More
irregular gas kinematics, also more clumpy and less centrally concentrated
light distributions of spiral field galaxies at intermediate redshifts in
comparison to their local counterparts indicate that these galaxies are
probably still in the process of building their disks via mechanisms such as
accretion and mergers. On the other hand, they have less irregular gas
kinematics compared to galaxies at z ~ 2.

morphisms of curves and surfaces such as $K3$ and general type, obtained by ad
hoc methods, in a new, more conceptual light. One of the main interests of our
result is to apply it to the construction of smooth varieties in projective
space with given invariants. We illustrate this by using our result to
construct canonically embedded surfaces with $c_1^2=3p_g-7$ and derive some
interesting properties of their moduli spaces. Another interesting application
of our result is the smoothing of ropes. We obtain a sufficient condition for a
rope embedded in projective space to be smoothable. As a consequence, we prove
that canonically embedded carpets satisfying certain conditions can be
smoothed. We also give simple, unified proofs of known theorems on the
smoothing of $1$--dimensional ropes and $K3$ carpets. Our condition for
deforming $\varphi$ to an embedding can be stated very transparently in terms
of the cohomology class of a suitable first order infinitesimal deformation of
$\varphi$. It holds in a very general setting (any $X$ of arbitrary dimension
and any $\varphi$ unobstructed with an algebraic formally semiuniversal
deformation). The simplicity of the result can be seen for instance when we
specialize it to the case of curves.

graphene nanoribbons under quasistatic uniaxial tension are predicted,
emphasizing the effect of edge structures (armchair and zigzag, without and
with hydrogen passivation). The results of atomistic simulations are
interpreted within a theoretical framework of thermodynamics, which enables
determination of the nonlinear functions for the strain-dependent edge energy
and the hydrogen adsorption energy, for both zigzag and armchair edges. Due to
the edge effects, the initial Young's modulus of graphene nanoribbons under
infinitesimal strain varies with the edge chirality and the ribbon width.
Furthermore, it is found that the nominal strain to fracture is considerably
lower for armchair graphene nanoribbons than for zigzag ribbons. Two distinct
fracture mechanisms are identified, with homogeneous nucleation for zigzag
ribbons and edge-controlled heterogeneous nucleation for armchair ribbons.
Hydrogen passivation of the edges is found to have negligible effect on the
mechanical properties of zigzag graphene nanoribbons, but its effect is more
significant for armchair ribbons.

class of inflationary settings. To be more precise, we employ a Bianchi-I
geometry (taken as an anisotropic perturbation of a flat FRW model) within two
types of Born-Infeld theories. Firstly we consider pure Born-Infeld
electromagnetism. For either a constant or a $b(\phi)$ coupling, inflationary
trajectories are modified but anisotropies increase; In particular, for the
former coupling we find that a quadratic inflaton potential, within a constant
ratio for the scalar and gauge energy densities, does not induce sufficient
inflation, while in the latter the back-reaction in the cosmology determines
(from the tensor-scalar ratio) a narrow range where inflation can occur. A
Dirac-Born-Infeld framework is afterwards analysed in both non-relativistic and
relativistic regimes. In the former, for different cases of the coupling
(richer with respect to mere BI setups) between scalar and gauge sectors, we
find that inflationary trajectories are modified, with anisotropy increasing or
decreasing. In particular, a tachyonic solution is studied, allowing for a non
standard ratio between scalar and gauge matter densities, enhancing sufficient
inflation, but with the anisotropy increasing. For the relativistic limit,
inflationary trajectories are also modified and anisotropies increase faster
than in the non-relativistic limit. Finally we discuss how magnetic seed fields
could evolve in these settings.

(MARNs) where $J$ single-antenna sources send independent information to one
$N$-antenna destination through one $M$-antenna relay. For complexity
considerations, we propose a linear framework, where the relay linearly
transforms its received signals to generate the forwarded signals without
decoding and the destination uses its multi-antennas to fully decouple signals
from different sources before decoding, by which the decoding complexity is
linear in the number of sources. To achieve a high symbol rate, we first
propose a scheme called DSTC-ICRec in which all sources' information streams
are concurrently transmitted in both the source-relay link and the
relay-destination link. In this scheme, distributed space-time coding (DSTC) is
applied at the relay, which satisfies the linear constraint. DSTC also allows
the destination to conduct the zero-forcing interference cancellation (IC)
scheme originally proposed for multi-antenna systems to fully decouple signals
from different sources. Our analysis shows that the symbol rate of DSTC-ICRec
is $1/2$ symbols/source/channel use and the diversity gain of the scheme is
upperbounded by $M-J+1$. To achieve a higher diversity gain, we propose another
scheme called TDMA-ICRec in which the sources time-share the source-relay link.
The relay coherently combines the signals on its antennas to maximize the
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of each source, then concurrently forwards all
sources' information. The destination performs zero-forcing IC. It is shown
through both analysis and simulation that when $N \ge 2J-1$, TDMA-ICRec
achieves the same maximum diversity gain as the full TDMA scheme in which the
information stream from each source is assigned to an orthogonal channel in
both links, but with a higher symbol rate.

dwarf and an average accretion rate, 6.3 E-9Msun/yr. For KR Aur, we estimate
that the white dwarf has Teff=29,000K, log g = 8.4 and contributes 18% of the
FUV flux while an accretion disk with accretion rate of 3 E-10Msun/yr at an
inclination of 41 degrees, contributes the remainder. We find that an accretion
disk dominates the far UV spectrum of V425 Cas but a white dwarf contributes
non-negligibly with approximately 18% of the FUV flux. For the two high state
nova-likes, HL Aqr and V825 Her, their accretion disks totally dominate with 1

analyzed varying the filling, the local Coulomb interaction and the $d-p$
hybridization. It should be remarked that the original n-pole approximation
(Phys. Rev. 184 (1969) 451) has been improved in order to include adequately
the $\vec{k}$-dependence of the important correlation function $<
\vec{S}_j\cdot\vec{S}_i>$ present in the poles of the Green's functions. It has
been verified that the topology of the Fermi surface (defined by
$A(\omega=0,\vec{k})$) is deeply affected by the doping, the strength of the
Coulomb interaction and also by the hybridization. Particularly, in the
underdoped regime, the spectral function $A(\omega=0,\vec{k})$ presents very
low intensity close to the anti-nodal points $(0,\pm \pi)$ and $(\pm \pi,0)$.
Such a behavior produces an anomalous Fermi surface (pockets) with pseudogaps
in the region of the anti-nodal points. On the other hand, if the $d-p$
hybridization is enhanced sufficiently, such pseudogaps vanish. It is precisely
the correlation function $< \vec{S}_j\cdot\vec{S}_i>$ present in the poles of
the Green's functions which plays the important role in the underdoped
situation. In fact, antiferromagnetic correlations coming from $<
\vec{S}_j\cdot\vec{S}_i>$ strongly modify the quasi-particle band structure.
This is the ultimate source of anomalies in the Fermi surface in the present
approach.

and describe the front motion law in the form of local normal velocity equal to
a constant (laminar speed) plus the normal projection of fluid velocity. In
level set formulation, G-equations are Hamilton-Jacobi equations with convex
($L^1$ type) but non-coercive Hamiltonians. Viscous G-equations arise from
either numerical approximations or regularizations by small diffusion. The
nonlinear eigenvalue $\bar H$ from the cell problem of the viscous G-equation
can be viewed as an approximation of the inviscid turbulent flame speed $s_T$.
An important problem in turbulent combustion theory is to study properties of
$s_T$, in particular how $s_T$ depends on the flow amplitude $A$. In this
paper, we will study the behavior of $\bar H=\bar H(A,d)$ as $A\to +\infty$ at
any fixed diffusion constant $d > 0$. For the cellular flow, we show that $$
\bar H(A,d)\leq O(\sqrt {\mathrm {log}A}) \quad \text{for all $d>0$}. $$
Compared with the inviscid G-equation ($d=0$), the diffusion dramatically slows
down the front propagation. For the shear flow, the limit
  \nit $\lim_{A\to +\infty}{\bar H(A,d)\over A} = \lambda (d) >0$ where
$\lambda (d)$ is strictly decreasing in $d$, and has zero derivative at $d=0$.
The linear growth law is also valid for $s_T$ of the curvature dependent
G-equation in shear flows.

excitation in a spin-1/2 system evolving under a series of small flip-angle
$\theta-$pulses $(\theta\ll 1)$ that are applied either periodically [which
corresponds to the DANTE pulse sequence] or aperiodically. First, an average
Hamiltonian description of the DANTE pulse sequence is developed; such a
description is determined to be valid either at or very far from the DANTE
resonance frequencies, which are simply integer multiples of the inverse of the
interpulse delay. For aperiodic excitation schemes where the interpulse delays
are chosen pseudorandomly, a single resonance can be selectively excited if the
$\theta$-pulses' phases are modulated in concert with the time delays. Such a
selective pulse is termed a pseudorandom-DANTE or p-DANTE sequence, and the
conditions in which an average Hamiltonian description of p-DANTE is found to
be similar to that found for the DANTE sequence. It is also shown that
averaging over different p-DANTE sequences that are selective for the same
resonance can help reduce excitations at frequencies away from the resonance
frequency, thereby improving the apparent selectivity of the p-DANTE sequences.
Finally, experimental demonstrations of p-DANTE sequences and comparisons with
theory are presented.

algorithms, building on our prior work. For directed acyclic graphs (DAGs),
first we decompose the topology into a number of two-source, two-receiver

reconstruct the topology. Our approach for DAGs builds on prior work on
tomography, and improves upon it by employing network coding to accurately
distinguish among all different 2-by-2 components. We evaluate our algorithms
through simulation of a number of realistic topologies and compare them to
active tomographic techniques without network coding. We also make connections
between our approach and alternatives, including passive inference, traceroute,

This gas may have
arisen from grain sublimation or grain photodesorption. It interacts with the
surrounding dust grains through a number of charge and heat exchanges. Studying
the chemical composition and physical state of this gas can therefore reveal
much about the dust component in these debris disks. We have produced a new
code, ontario, to address gas emission from dusty gas-poor disks around A--F
stars. This code computes the gas ionization and thermal balance
self-consistently, with particular care taken of heating/cooling mechanisms.
Line emission spectra are then produced for each species (up to zinc) by
statistical equilibrium calculations of the atomic/ionic energy levels. For
parameters that resemble the observed beta Pictoris gas disk, we find that the
gas is primarily heated by photoelectric emission from dust grains, and
primarily cooled through the CII 157.7 micron line emission. The gas can be
heated to a temperature that is warmer than that of the dust and may in some
cases reach temperature for thermal escape. The dominant cooling line, CII
157.7 micron, should be detectable by Herschel in these disks, while the OI
63.2 micron line will be too faint. We also study the dependence of the cooling
line fluxes on a variety of disk parameters, in light of the much improved
sensitivity to thermal line emission in the mid/far infrared and at
sub-millimeter wavelengths provided by, in particular, Herschel, SOFIA and
ALMA. These new instruments will yield much new information about dusty debris

prospects of application of SDP for deriving orbital parameters of binary
systems using data supplied by Bosscha Observatory that has been published in
the Centre de Donnees astronomiques de Strasbourg. This study will support

binary systems for their ongoing researches. Since SDP is a powerful scheme,
free trial-and-error and human-independent judgment, we suggest that SDP may
become a standard method for determining orbital parameters of binary systems.

describe triangulations, we rely on a combinatorial hypermap specification

attaching coordinates to elements in a consistent way. We then describe what

termination of the algorithm, we use a generic approach expressing that any

Purifying selection dominates in large panmictic populations, where Mendelian
law of independent gene assortment is valid. If the populations are small,
recombination processes are not effective enough to ensure an independent
assortment of linked genes and larger clusters of genes could be inherited as
the genetic units. There are whole clusters of genes which tend to complement
in such conditions instead of single pairs of alleles like in the case of
purifying selection. Computer simulations have shown that switching in-between
complementation and purification strategies has a character of a phase
transition. This is also responsible for specific distribution of recombination
events observed along eukaryotic chromosomes - higher recombination rate is
observed in subtelomeric regions than in central parts of chromosomes - for
sympatric speciation and probably for non-monotonous relation between
reproduction potential and genetic distance between parents.

differential flux upper limits, assuming the emission to be point-like (<0.1

around 1 TeV are at the level of 3 % and 2 % of the Crab Nebula flux, for the

extended over a much larger area than our point spread function, or it must be
peaked at energies beyond 1 TeV, resulting in a photon index harder than 2.2 in
the TeV band.

twofold. Firstly, we propose an alternative approximation scheme based on
Picard iterations. This approach is similar in accuracy to the Euler
discretization, but with the feature that each rate is evolved independently of
the other rates in the term structure. This enables simultaneous calculation of
derivative prices of different maturities using parallel computing. Secondly,
the product terms occurring in the drift of a LIBOR market model driven by a
jump process grow exponentially as a function of the number of rates, quickly
rendering the model intractable. We reduce this growth from exponential to
quadratic using truncated expansions of the product terms. We include numerical
illustrations of the accuracy and speed of our method pricing caplets,

prototypical region of high-mass star formation. Methods: W3 IRS5 was observed
by HIFI on the Herschel Space Observatory with deep integration (about 2500 s)
in 8 spectral regions. Results: The target lines including CH, NH, H3O+, and
the new molecules SH+, H2O+, and OH+ are detected. The H2O+ and OH+ J=1-0 lines
are found mostly in absorption, but also appear to exhibit weak emission
(P-Cyg-like). Emission requires high density, thus originates most likely near
the protostar. This is corroborated by the absence of line shifts relative to
the young stellar object (YSO). In addition, H2O+ and OH+ also contain strong
absorption components at a velocity shifted relative to W3 IRS5, which are
attributed to foreground clouds. Conclusions: The molecular column densities
derived from observations correlate well with the predictions of a model that
assumes the main emission region is in outflow walls, heated and irradiated by
protostellar UV radiation.

were synthesized in snapshots with a mixed polarity field having a mean
magnetic flux density of 0.2 mT and mean unsigned field strength of 35 mT. We
found that downflows with a velocity of 0.5 km/s predominate, on the average,
in areas with some network magnetic elements at the disk center. In separate
strong fluxtubes the average velocity is equal to 3 km/s and the maximum
velocity is 9 km/s. In weak diffuse magnetic fields upflows dominate. Their
average velocity is 0.5 km/s and maximal one is 3 km/s. The V-profile asymmetry
depends on the spatial resolution. The V profiles synthesized with high spatial
resolution (35 km) have average amplitude and area asymmetries -1%, 1%,
respectively. The asymmetry scatter is \pm70% for weak profiles and \pm10% for
strong ones. The profiles with low spatial resolution (700 km) have average
amplitude and area asymmetries 3%, -2\%, respectively. Low spatial resolution
is a reason why the amplitude asymmetry is always positive and greater than the
area asymmetry in V profiles observed. We found weak correlation between the
asymmetry of V profiles and velocity. Upflows cause negative asymmetry, on the
average, and downflows cause positive asymmetry. We examined center-to-limb
variations of vertical velocity in magnetic elements. Beginning from cos theta

In comparing the spectra taken by these two different methods, consistency with
the nanocavities' resonant wavelengths is found. Furthermore, it is shown that
the reflectance method can measure both active and passive cavities. Q-factors
of nanocavities, whose resonant wavelengths range from 1280 to 1620 nm, are
measured by the reflectance method in cross polarization. Experimentally,
Q-factors decrease for longer wavelengths and the intensity, reflected by the
nanocavities on resonance, becomes minimal around 1370 nm. The trend of the
Q-factors is explained by the change of the slab thickness relative to the
resonant wavelength, showing a good agreement between theory and experiment.
The trend of reflected intensity by the nanocavities on resonance can be
understood as effects that originate from the PC slab and the underlying air
cladding thickness. In addition to three dimensional finite-difference
time-domain calculations, an analytical model is introduced that is able to
reproduce the wavelength dependence of the reflected intensity observed in the
experiment.

turbulent transport in tokamak plasmas with rotational shear. At sufficiently
large flow shears, linear instabilities are suppressed, but transiently growing
modes drive subcritical turbulence whose amplitude increases with flow shear.
This leads to a local minimum in the heat flux, indicating an optimal E x B
shear value for plasma confinement. Local maxima in the momentum fluxes are
also observed, allowing for the possibility of bifurcations in the E x B shear.
The sensitive dependence of heat flux on temperature gradient is relaxed for
large flow shear values, with the critical temperature gradient increasing at
lower flow shear values. The turbulent Prandtl number is found to be largely
independent of temperature and flow gradients, with a value close to unity.

study enhanced heat transfer by a model junction immersed between two thermal

heat power is enhanced via controlling the junction by means of external

efficiency of enhancement is defined via the increment in the heat power
divided over the amount of consumed work. We show that this efficiency is
bounded from above by $T_c/(T_h-T_c)$. Formally this is identical to the Carnot

conductance of quantum impurity models from the Matsubara Green function. A
continued fraction expansion of the Fermi distribution is employed which was
recently introduced by Ozaki [Phys. Rev. B 75, 035123 (2007)] and converges
much faster than the usual Matsubara representation. We give a simplified
derivation of Ozaki's idea using concepts from many-body condensed matter
theory and present results for the rate of convergence. In case that the Green
function of some model of interest is only known numerically, interpolating
between Matsubara frequencies is much more stable than carrying out an analytic
continuation to the real axis. We demonstrate this explicitly by considering an
infinite tight-binding chain with a single site impurity as an exactly-solvable
test system, showing that it is advantageous to calculate transport properties
directly on the imaginary axis. The formalism is applied to the single impurity
Anderson model, and the linear conductance at finite temperatures is calculated
reliably at small to intermediate Coulomb interactions by virtue of the
Matsubara functional renormalization group. Thus, this quantum many-body method
combined with the continued fraction expansion of the Fermi function
constitutes a promising tool to address more complex quantum dot geometries at
finite temperatures.

Kepler RR Lyrae stars RR Lyr, V808 Cyg and V355 Lyr. Interestingly, all these
pulsating stars show Blazhko modulation. The period doubling manifests itself
as alternating maxima and minima of the pulsational cycles in the light curve,
as well as through the appearance of half-integer frequencies located halfway
between the main pulsation period and its harmonics in the frequency spectrum.
The effect was found to be stronger during certain phases of the modulation
cycle. We were able to reproduce the period doubling bifurcation in our
nonlinear RR Lyrae models computed by the Florida-Budapest hydrocode. This
enabled us to trace the origin of this instability in RR Lyrae stars to a
resonance, namely a 9:2 resonance between the fundamental mode and a high-order
(9th) radial overtone showing strange-mode characteristics. We discuss the
connection of this new type of variation to the mysterious Blazhko effect and
argue that it may give us fresh insights to solve this century-old enigma.

sample contains 63 known globular clusters, 174 known open clusters and 32 so
far unclassified objects. Isochrone fitting has been used to homogeneously
calculate the age, distance and reddening to all clusters. The mean age of the
open clusters in our sample is 1Gyr. The positions of these clusters in the
Galactic Plane show that 80% of open clusters older than 1Gyr have a
Galactocentric distance of more than 7kpc. The scale height for the old open
clusters above the Plane is 375pc, more than three times as large as the 115pc
which we obtain for the younger open clusters in our sample. We find that the
mean optical extinction towards the open clusters in the disk of the Galaxy is
0.70mag/kpc. The FSR sample has a strong selection bias towards objects with an
apparent core radius of 30"" to 50"" and there is an unexplained paucity of old
open clusters in the Galactic Longitude range of 120deg < l < 180deg.

important to catalogue and consider the various effects which make a promising

propose a novel approach for reconstruction of the composition of an unknown

This method is based on compressive sensing theory, which deals with
reconstruction of a sparse signal using a small number of measurements.
Utilizing the fact that in many cases each bacterial community is comprised of
a small subset of the known bacterial species, we show the feasibility of this
approach for determining the composition of a bacterial mixture. Using
simulations, we show that sequencing a few hundred base-pairs of the 16S rRNA
gene sequence may provide enough information for reconstruction of mixtures
containing tens of species, out of tens of thousands, even in the presence of
realistic measurement noise. Finally, we show initial promising results when
applying our method for the reconstruction of a toy experimental mixture with
five species. Our approach may have a potential for a practical and efficient
way for identifying bacterial species compositions in biological samples.

numerically computing the fluctuation eigenmodes about domain wall solutions,
we find different spectra for doppelgangers and canonical walls, allowing us to
distinguish between k-defects and the canonical walls they mimic. We search for
doppelgangers for cosmic strings by numerically constructing solutions of DBI

the detailed spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We present a

effects of radiation while analyzing the problem, in contrast to other work
which inadvertently fine tunes its spatial profile. This is a surprisingly
important effect and we reach substantially different conclusions. Models which
are open at CMB distances fit the CMB power spectrum without fine tuning; these
models also fit the supernovae and local Hubble rate data which favours a high
expansion rate. Asymptotically flat models may fit the CMB, but require some
extra assumptions. We argue that a full treatment of the radiation in these

distortions of the black body spectrum, the kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect

hardly connect themselves to the formalism of relativistic cosmology type
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker. The present work posits the possibility of building
this connection by postulating a Yukawa-like scalar potential, with non
gravitational origin. This potential comes from a simple reflection speculate
of the well-know potential of Yukawa and it is intended to describe the
following physics scenarios: null in very near solar system, slightly
attractive in ranges of interstellar distances, very attractive in distance
ranges comparable to galaxies cluster, and repulsive to cosmic scales. As a
result of introducing this potential into the typical Friedman equations we
found that the critical density of matter is consistent with the observed
density (without a dark matter assumption), besides this, MoND theory is
obtained for interstellar scales and consequently would explain rotation
curves. Also it is shown that Yukawa type inverse does not alter the
predictions of the Cosmic Microwave Background neither the primordial
nucleosinthesys in early universe; and can be useful to explain the large-scale

unsolved puzzles in condensed matter physics, and is poorly understood.
Although there appears to be a great deal of universality in the cuprates,
several orders of magnitude changes in T$_c$ can be achieved through changes in
the chemical composition and structure of the unit cell. In this paper we
formulate a systematic examination of the variations in electron-phonon
coupling to oxygen phonons in the cuprates, incorporating a number of effects
arising from several aspects of chemical composition and doping across cuprate
families. It is argued that the electron-phonon coupling is a very sensitive
probe of the material-dependent variations of chemical structure, affecting the
orbital character of the band crossing the Fermi level, the strength of local
electric fields arising from structural-induced symmetry breaking, doping
dependent changes in the underlying band structure, and ionicity of the crystal
governing the ability of the material to screen $c$-axis perturbations. Using
electrostatic Ewald calculations and known experimental structural data, we
establish a connection between the material's maximal T$_c$ at optimal doping
and the strength of coupling to $c$-axis modes. We demonstrate that materials
with the largest coupling to the out-of-phase bond-buckling (``$B_{1g}$"")
oxygen phonon branch also have the largest T$_c$'s. In light of this
observation we present model T$_c$ calculations using a two-well model where
phonons work in conjunction with a dominant pairing interaction, presumably due
to spin fluctuations, indicating how phonons can generate sizeable enhancements
to T$_c$ despite the relatively small coupling strengths. Combined, these
results can provide a natural framework for understanding the doping and
material dependence of T$_c$ across the cuprates.

investigate---through a comparison between calculated and low-temperature
experimental properties---whether the $5f$ electrons are localized or
delocalized in URu$_2$Si$_2$. We also performed dynamical mean field theory
calculations (LDA+DMFT) to investigate the temperature evolution of the
quasi-particle states at 100~K and above, unveiling a progressive opening of a
quasi-particle gap at the chemical potential when temperature is reduced. A
detailed comparison of calculated properties with known experimental data
demonstrates that the LSDA and GGA approaches, in which the uranium $5f$
electrons are treated as itinerant, provide an excellent explanation of the
available low-temperature experimental data of the PM and LMAF phases. We show
furthermore that due to a materials-specific Fermi surface instability a large,
but partial, Fermi surface gapping of up to 750 K occurs upon antiferromagnetic
symmetry breaking. The occurrence of the HO phase is explained through
dynamical symmetry breaking induced by a mode of long-lived antiferromagnetic
spin-fluctuations. This dynamical symmetry breaking model explains why the
Fermi surface gapping in the HO phase is similar but smaller than that in the
LMAF phase and it also explains why the HO and LMAF phases have the same Fermi
surfaces yet different order parameters. Suitable derived order parameters for
the HO are proposed to be the Fermi surface gap or the dynamic spin-spin

example, Bell states can become separable). We use this approach to develop
alternative methods of classical simulation that have strong connections to the

admit operations outside the Clifford set and can generate some forms of
multiparty quantum entanglement, but are otherwise classical in that they can
be efficiently simulated classically and cannot generate non-local statistics.

reflects the variation and the sign reversal of the TER. The quantity of the
imaginary Fermi velocity allows to obtain detailed information on the transport
properties of FTJs by analyzing the complex bandstructure of the barrier
material.

Kent, Phys. Rev. B {\bf 79}, 195117 (2009); Reboredo, {\it ibid.} {\bf 80},
125110 (2009)] is extended to study the ground and excited states of magnetic
and periodic systems. The method converges to exact eigenstates as the
statistical data collected increases if the wave function is sufficiently
flexible. It is shown that the wave functions of complex anti-symmetric
eigen-states can be written as the product of an anti-symmetric real factor and
a symmetric phase factor. The dimensionality of the nodal surface is dependent
on whether phase is a scalar function or not. A recursive optimization
algorithm is derived from the time evolution of the mixed probability density,
which is given by an ensemble of electronic configurations (walkers) with
complex weight. This complex weight allows the amplitude of the fixed-node wave
function to move away from the trial wave function phase. This novel approach
is both a generalization of SHDMC and the fixed-phase approximation [Ortiz,
Ceperley and Martin, Phys Rev. Lett. {\bf 71}, 2777 (1993)]. When used
recursively it simultaneously improves the node and the phase. The algorithm is
demonstrated to converge to nearly exact solutions of model systems with
periodic boundary conditions or applied magnetic fields. The computational cost
is proportional to the number of independent degrees of freedom of the phase.
The method is applied to obtain low-energy excitations of Hamiltonians with
magnetic field or periodic boundary conditions. The method is used to optimize
wave functions with twisted boundary conditions, which are included in a
many-body Bloch phase. The potential applications of this new method to study
periodic, magnetic, and complex Hamiltonians are discussed.
