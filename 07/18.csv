solution, we study how the shear and the backreaction depend on the sharpness
of the spatial transition between voids and walls and on the size of the voids.
The voids considered here are regions with matter density Omega ~ 0 and
expansion rate Ht ~ 1, while the walls are regions with matter density Omega ~
1 and expansion rate Ht ~ 2/3. The results indicate that both the
volume-average shear and the variance of the expansion rate grow proportional
to the sharpness of the transition and diverge in the limit of a step function,
but, for realistic-sized voids, are virtually independent of the size of the
void. However, the backreaction, given by the difference of the variance and
the shear, has a finite value in the step-function limit. By comparing the
exact result for the backreaction to the case where the shear is neglected by
treating the voids and walls as separate Friedmann-Robertson-Walker models, we
find that the shear suppresses the backreaction by a factor of (r_0/t_0)^2, the
squared ratio of the void size to the horizon size. This exemplifies the
importance of using the exact solution for the interface between the regions of
different expansion rates and densities. The suppression is justified to hold
also for a network of compensated voids, but may not hold if the universe is
dominated by uncompensated voids.

optical counterpart to PSRB1055-52 was proposed by Mignani and coworkers based
on Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations performed in 1996, in one spectral
band only. We report on HST observations of this field carried out in 2008, in
four spectral bands. The astrometric and photometric analyses of these data
confirm the identification of the proposed candidate as the pulsar's optical
counterpart. Similarly to other middle-aged pulsars, its optical-UV spectrum
can be described by the sum of a power-law (PLO) component, presumably emitted
from the pulsar magnetosphere, and a Rayleigh-Jeans (RJ) component emitted from
the NS surface. The spectral index of the PLO component, alpha_O=1.05+/-0.34,
is larger than for other pulsars with optical counterparts. The RJ component,
with the brightness temperature TO=(0.66+/-0.10) d_350**2 R_O,13**-2 MK (where
d_350 and R_O,13 are the distance to the pulsar in units of 350 pc and the
radius of the emitting area in units of 13 km), shows a factor of 4 excess with
respect to the extrapolation of the X-ray thermal component into the
UV-optical. This hints that the RJ component is emitted from a larger, colder
area, and suggests that the distance to the pulsar is smaller than previously
thought. From the absolute astrometry of the HST images we measured the pulsar
coordinates with a position accuracy of 0.15"". From the comparison with

studied in both modes $\pi^{-}p \rightarrow \pi^{-}\pi^{+}\pi^{-}p$ and
$\pi^{-}~p \rightarrow \pi^{-}\pi^{0}\pi^{0}~p$. Reconstruction of charged and
neutral mode rely on completely different parts of the apparatus. Observation
of new st ates in both modes provides important checks. The results on
diffractive dissociation into 3$\pi$ final states from the 2004 data recently

information for tasks such as shape and scene recognition, object detection, or
motion planning and object grasping in robotics. In this thesis, we introduce a
general machine learning approach called unsupervised CRF learning based on
maximizing the conditional likelihood. We apply our approach to computer vision
systems that recover the 3-D scene geometry from images. We focus on recovering
3D geometry from single images, stereo pairs and video sequences. Building
these systems requires algorithms for doing inference as well as learning the
parameters of conditional Markov random fields (MRF). Our system is trained
unsupervisedly without using ground-truth labeled data. We employ a
slanted-plane stereo vision model in which we use a fixed over-segmentation to
segment the left image into coherent regions called superpixels, then assign a
disparity plane for each superpixel. Plane parameters are estimated by solving
an MRF labelling problem, through minimizing an energy fuction. We demonstrate
the use of our unsupervised CRF learning algorithm for a parameterized
slanted-plane stereo vision model involving shape from texture cues. Our stereo
model with texture cues, only by unsupervised training, outperforms the results
in related work on the same stereo dataset. In this thesis, we also formulate
structure and motion estimation as an energy minimization problem, in which the
model is an extension of our slanted-plane stereo vision model that also
handles surface velocity. Velocity estimation is achieved by solving an MRF
labeling problem using Loopy BP. Performance analysis is done using our novel
evaluation metrics based on the notion of view prediction error. Experiments on
road-driving stereo sequences show encouraging results.

A clustering signal of z=6.6 LAEs is detected for the first time. We obtain the
correlation length of r_0=2-5 h^(-1) Mpc and bias of b=3-6, and find no
significant boost of clustering amplitude by reionization at z=6.6. The average

cycle of LAE population is roughly ~1% albeit with large uncertainties. The
average of our high-quality Keck/DEIMOS spectra shows an FWHM velocity width of
251 +/-16 km s^(-1). We find no large evolution of Lya line profile from z=5.7

The combination of various reionization models and our observational results
about the LF, clustering, and line profile indicates that there would exist a
small decrease of IGM's Lya transmission owing to reionization, but that the

storage is studied using first-principles density functional theory
calculations. Unlike the physisorption of H2 on the H-terminated chain, we show
that two Li (Na) atoms each capping one end of the carbon chain can hold ten H2
molecules with optimal binding energies for room temperature storage. The
hybridization of the Li 2p states with the H2 sigma orbitals contributes to the
H2 adsorption. However, the binding mechanism of the H2 molecules on Na arises
only from the polarization interaction between the charged Na atom and the H2.
Moreover, additional H2 molecules can be bound to the carbon atoms at the chain
ends due to the charge transfer between Li 2s2p (Na 3s) and C 2p states.
Importantly, dimerization of these isolated metal-capped chains does not affect
the hydrogen binding energy significantly. In addition, a single chain can be
stabilized effectively by termination on the C60 clusters. With a hydrogen
uptake of > 10 wt % on Li-coated C60-Cn-C60 (n = 5, 8), the Li12C60-Cn-Li12C60
complex, without reducing the number of adsorbed H2 molecules per Li, can serve
as better building blocks of polymers than the (Li12C60)2 dimer. These findings
suggest a new route to design cluster-assembled storage materials based on

a time coordinate in a spacetime. This has implications for notions such as the
surface of the black hole and also on quasi-local physical quantities such as
horizon measures of mass and angular momentum. In this paper, we compare
different horizons on non-spherically symmetric slicings of Vaidya spacetimes.
The spacetimes we investigate include both accreting and evaporating black
holes. For some simple choices of the Vaidya mass function function
corresponding to collapse of a hollow shell, we compare the area for the
numerically found axisymmetric trapping horizons with the area of the
spherically symmetric trapping horizon and event horizon. We find that as
expected, both the location and area are dependent on the choice of foliation.
However, the area variation is not large, of order $0.035\%$ for a slowly
evolving horizon with $\dot{m}=0.02$. We also calculate analytically the
difference in area between the spherically symmetric quasi-local horizon and
event horizon for a slowly accreting black hole. We find that the difference
can be many orders of magnitude larger than the Planck area for sufficiently
large black holes.

incorporating a detailed energy balance equation into a thin-disk model for the
formation and evolution of circumstellar disks around low-mass protostars.Our
model includes the effect of radiative cooling, viscous and shock heating, and
heating due to stellar and background irradiation. Following the collapse from
the prestellar phase allows us to model the early embedded phase of disk
formation and evolution. During this time, the disk is susceptible to
fragmentation, depending upon the properties of the initial prestellar core.
Globally, we find that higher initial core angular momentum and mass content
favors more fragmentation, but higher levels of background radiation can
moderate the tendency to fragment. A higher rate of mass infall onto the disk
than that onto the star is a necessary but not sufficient condition for disk
fragmentation. More locally, both the Toomre Q-parameter needs to be below a
critical value _and_ the local cooling time needs to be shorter than a few
times the local dynamical time. Fragments that form during the early embedded
phase tend to be driven into the inner disk regions, and likely trigger mass
accretion and luminosity bursts that are similar in magnitude to
FU-Orionis-type or EX-Lupi-like events. Disk accretion is shown to be an
intrinsically variable process, thanks to disk fragmentation, nonaxisymmetric
structure, and the effect of gravitational torques. The additional effect of a
generic \alpha-type viscosity acts to reduce burst frequency and accretion
variability, and is likely to not be viable for values of \alpha significantly
greater than 0.01.

the Willmore functional of immersed surfaces into $R^m$. This approach gives
for instance a new proof of the existence of a Willmore minimizing embedding of
an arbitrary closed surface in arbitrary codimension. We explain how the same
approach can solve constraint minimization problems for the Willmore
functional. We show in particular that, for a given closed surface and a given
conformal class for this surface, there is an immersion in $R^m$, away possibly
from isolated branched points, which minimizes the Willmore energy among all
possible Lipschitz immersions in $R^m$ having an $L^2-$bounded second
fundamental form and realizing this conformal class. This branched immersion is
either a smooth Conformal Willmore branched immersion or an isothermic branched
immersion. We show that branched points do not exist whenever the minimal
energy in the conformal class is less than $8\pi$ and that these immersions
extend to smooth conformal Willmore embeddings or global isothermic embeddings
of the surface in that case. Finally, as a by-product of our analysis, we
establish that inside a compact subspace of the moduli space the following
holds : weak limit of Palais Smale Willmore sequences are Conformal Willmore,
that weak limits of Palais Smale sequences of Conformal Willmore are either
Conformal Willmore or Global Isothermic and finally we observe also that weakly

translational symmetry in two-dimensional multi-orbital systems with a
particular focus on t$_{2g}$ orbitals in square lattice. Due to distinct
symmetry properties of d-orbitals, a nodal charge or spin density wave state
with Dirac points protected by lattice symmetries can be achieved. When an
additional order parameter with opposite reflection symmetry is introduced to a
nodal density wave state, the system can be fully gapped leading to a band
insulator. Among those, topological density wave (TDW) insulators can be
realized, when an effective staggered on-site potential generates a gap to a
pair of Dirac points connected by the inversion symmetry which have the same
topological winding numbers. We also present a mean-field phase diagram for
various density wave states, and discuss experimental implications of our
results.

  Potential","Submitted to Soft Matter",,,,"cond-mat.soft physics.bio-ph physics.chem-ph physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We model cyclic voltammetry experiments on supported lipid films where a
non-trivial dependence of the capacitance on the applied voltage is observed.
Previously, based on a mean-field treatment of the Flory-Huggins type, under
the assumption of strongly screened electrostatic interactions, it has been
hypothesized that peaks in the capacitance-vs-voltage profiles correspond to a
sequence of structural or phase transitions within the interface. To examine
this hypothesis, in this study we use both mean-field calculations and Monte
Carlo simulations where the electrostatic effects due to the varying electric
potential and the presence of salt are accounted for explicitly. Our main focus
is on the structure of the film and the desorption-readsorption phenomena.
These are found to be driven by a strong competition for the progressively
charged-up (hydrophobic) surface between lipid hydrocarbon tails and the
electrode counterions (cations). As the surface charge density is raised, the
following phase phenomena within the interface are clearly observed: (i) a
gradual displacement of the monolayer from the surface by the counterions,
leading to complete monolayer desorption and formation of an electric double
layer by the surface, (ii) a transformation of the monolayer into a bilayer
upon its desorption, (iii) in the case of zwitterionic (or strongly polar)
lipid head groups, the desorption is followed by the bilayer readsorption to
the electrode via interaction with the electric double layer and release of the
excess counterions into the bulk solution. We argue then that the voltammetry
peaks are associated with a stepwise process of formation of layers of
alternating charge: electric double layer - upon film desorption, triple or
multi-layer - upon film readsoption.

quasi-classical trajectory (QCT) method within the Gaussian binning (GB)
procedure. The latter consists in ""quantizing"" the final vibrational actions in
Bohr spirit by putting strong emphasis on the trajectories reaching the
products with vibrational actions close to integer values. A major drawback of
this procedure is that if N is the number of product vibrational modes, the
amount of trajectories necessary to converge the calculations is ~ 10^N larger
than with the standard QCT method. Applying it to polyatomic processes is thus
problematic. In a recent paper, however, Czako and Bowman propose to quantize
the total vibrational energy instead of the vibrational actions [G. Czako and
J. M. Bowman, J. Chem. Phys., 131, 244302 (2009)], a procedure called 1GB here.
The calculations are then only ~ 10 times more time-consuming than with the
standard QCT method, allowing thereby for considerable numerical saving. In
this paper, we propose some theoretical arguments supporting the 1GB procedure
and check its validity on model test cases as well as the prototype four-atom
reaction OH+D_2 -> HOD+D.
