138-d of observation. We report precise pulsation periods for all stars. Nine
of these stars had incorrect or unknown periods in the literature. Fourteen of
the stars exhibit both amplitude and phase Blazhko modulations, with Blazhko
periods ranging from 27.7 to more than 200 days. For V445 Lyr, a longer
secondary variation is also observed in addition to its 53.2-d Blazhko period.
The unprecedented precision of the Kepler photometry has led to the discovery
of the the smallest modulations detected so far. Moreover, additional
frequencies beyond the well-known harmonics and Blazhko multiplets have been
found. These frequencies are located around the half-integer multiples of the
main pulsation frequency for at least three stars. In four stars, these
frequencies are close to the first and/or second overtone modes. The amplitudes
of these periodicities seem to vary over the Blazhko cycle. V350 Lyr, a
non-Blazhko star in our sample, is the first example of a double mode RR Lyrae
star that pulsates in its fundamental and second overtone modes.

algebra extended with the generators of the deformed Weyl algebra. The part of
deformed algebra, generated by rotation, boost and momentum generators, is
described by the Hopf algebra structure. The approach used in our
considerations is completely Lorentz covariant. We further use an adventages of
this approach to consistently construct a star product which has a property
that under integration sign it can be replaced by a standard pointwise
multiplication, a property that was since known to hold for Moyal, but not also
for kappa-Minkowski spacetime. This star product also has generalized trace and
cyclic properties and the construction alone is accomplished by considering a
classical Dirac operator representation of deformed algebra and by requiring it
to be hermitian. We find that the obtained star product is not translationally
invariant, leading to a conclusion that the classical Dirac operator
representation is the one where translation invariance cannot simultaneously be
implemented along with hermiticity. However, due to the integral property
satisfied by the star product, noncommutative free scalar field theory does not
have a problem with translation symmetry breaking and can be shown to reduce to
an ordinary free scalar field theory without nonlocal features and tachionic

nonlinear oscillator model of the Duffing oscillator, in which the nanowire
acts as a purely inductive element, in the limit of low temperatures and low

peak at higher driving power, which is due to dissipation. We observe a
hysteretic bifurcation behavior of the transmission response to frequency sweep

the Duffing bistability diagram. We also propose a concept of a nanowire-based

isotropization has been achieved independently of the initial anisotropy

technique, we identify two distinct thermalization regimes, strong and weak,
occurring for different initial states. Strong thermalization, intrinsically
quantum, happens when instantaneous local expectation values converge to the
thermal ones. Weak thermalization, well-known in classical systems, happens
when local expectation values converge to the thermal ones only after time

tabled evaluation is the scheduling strategy. The two most popular strategies
are local and batched evaluation.
  The former collects all the solutions to a tabled predicate before making any
one of them available outside the tabled computation. The latter returns
answers one by one before computing them all, which in principle is better if
only one answer (or a subset of the answers) is desired.
  Batched evaluation is closer to SLD evaluation in that it computes solutions
lazily as they are demanded, but it may need arbitrarily more memory than local
evaluation, which is able to reclaim memory sooner. Some programs which in
practice can be executed under the local strategy quickly run out of memory
under batched evaluation. This has led to the general adoption of local
evaluation at the expense of the more depth-first batched strategy.
  In this paper we study the reasons for the high memory consumption of batched
evaluation and propose a new scheduling strategy which we have termed swapping
evaluation. Swapping evaluation also returns answers one by one before
completing a tabled call, but its memory usage can be orders of magnitude less
than batched evaluation. An experimental implementation in the XSB system shows
that swapping evaluation is a feasible memory-scalable strategy that need not
compromise execution speed.

oncological diseases to the existing hadron therapy facilities. We demonstrate
how the protons, accelerated from near-critical density plasmas by laser pulses
having relatively small power, reach energies which may be of interest for
medical applications. When an intense laser pulse interacts with near-critical
density plasma it makes a channel both in the electron and then in the ion
density. The propagation of a laser pulse through such a self-generated channel
is connected with the acceleration of electrons in the wake of a laser pulse
and generation of strong moving electric and magnetic fields in the propagation
channel. Upon exiting the plasma the magnetic field generates a quasi-static
electric field that accelerates and collimates ions from a thin filament formed
in the propagation channel. Two-dimensional Particle-in-Cell simulations show
that a 100 TW laser pulse tightly focused on a near-critical density target is
able to accelerate protons up to energy of 250 MeV. Scaling laws and optimal
conditions for proton acceleration are established considering the energy
depletion of the laser pulse.

  Astrophysics. Revised version with English corrections",,"10.1051/0004-6361/201014490",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Spectral observations of classical T Tauri stars show a wide range of line
profiles, many of which reveal signs of matter inflow and outflow. Halpha is
the most commonly observed line profile due to its intensity, and it is highly
dependent on the characteristics of the surrounding environment of these stars.
Our aim is to analyze how the Halpha line profile is affected by the various
parameters of our model which contains both the magnetospheric and disk wind
contributions to the Halpha flux. We used a dipolar axisymmetric stellar
magnetic field to model the stellar magnetosphere and a modified Blandford &
Payne model was used in our disk wind region. A three-level atom with continuum
was used to calculate the required Hydrogen level populations. We use the
Sobolev approximation and a ray-by-ray method to calculate the integrated line
profile. Through an extensive study of the model parameter space, we have
investigated the contribution of many of the model parameters on the calculated
line profiles. Our results show that the Halpha line is strongly dependent on
the densities and temperatures inside the magnetosphere and the disk wind
region. The bulk of the flux comes, most of the time, from the magnetospheric
component for standard classical T Tauri stars parameters, but the disk wind
contribution becomes more important as the mass accretion rate, the
temperatures and densities inside the disk wind increase. We have also found
that most of the disk wind contribution to the Halpha line is emitted at the
innermost region of the disk wind. Models that take into consideration both
inflow and outflow of matter are a necessity to fully understand and describe
classical T Tauri stars.

accompanied by outgoing modes in the exterior, again with an amplitude
suppressed by the same factor. A suitable superposition of the two solutions is
necessary to conserve the dust probability flux across the apparent horizon,
thus each region contains both ingoing and outgoing dust modes. If one
restricts oneself to considering only the modes outside the apparent horizon
then one should think of the apparent horizon as a partial reflector, the
probability for a shell to reflect being given by the Boltzmann factor at the
Hawking temperature determined by the mass contained within it. However, if one
considers the entire wave function, the outgoing wave in the exterior is seen
to be the transmission through the horizon of the interior outgoing wave that
accompanies the collapsing shells. This transmission could allow information
from the interior to be transferred to the exterior.

allow us to explore charge traps that affect electrons when the background is
extremely low. We develop a model for the readout process that reproduces the
observed trails out to 70 pixels. We then invert the model to convert the
observed pixel values in an image into an estimate of the original pixel

images with a variety of stars on a variety of background levels, it restores
flux, position, and shape. This means that the observed trails contain
essentially all of the flux lost to inefficient CTE. The Space Telescope
Science Institute is currently evaluating this algorithm with the aim of
optimizing it and eventually providing enhanced data products. The empirical
procedure presented here should also work for other epochs (eg., pre-SM4),
though the parameters may have to be recomputed for the time when ACS was
operated at a higher temperature than the current -81 C. Finally, this

spectroscopically-confirmed z~5 LBGs, seven of which are contained within a
narrow (z=4.95\pm 0.08) redshift range and the eighth is at z=5.2. No source
was individually detected. Assuming the CO to H2 conversion factor for vigorous
starbursts, we place upper limits on the molecular gas content of individual
z~5 LBGs of M(H2)<~10^10 Msun. From a stacking analysis combining all of the
non-detections, the typical z~5 LBG has an H2 mass limit comparable to their
stellar mass, < 3.1 x 10^9 Msun. This limit implies that, given the star
formation rates of these systems (measured from their UV emission), star
formation could be sustained for at most ~100Myr, similar to the typical ages
of their stellar populations. The lack of a substantially larger reservoir of
cold gas argues against the LBGs being UV luminous super starbursts embedded in
much larger UV-dark systems and as a result increases the likelihood that at
least those LBGs with multiple components are starbursts triggered by mergers.
The sources responsible for reionization are expected to be starbursts similar
to these systems, but with lower luminosities, masses and consequently with
star formation timescales far shorter than the recombination timescale. If so,
the ionized bubbles expected in the IGM during the reionization era will
infrequently have UV-luminous sources at their centres.

BAL properties are measured for SiIV lambda1400, CIV lambda1550, AlIII
lambda1860 and MgII lambda2800, resulting in a catalogue of 3547 BALQSOs. Two
corrections, based on extensive testing of synthetic BALQSO spectra, are
applied in order to estimate the intrinsic fraction of CIV BALQSOs. First, the
probability of an observed BALQSO spectrum being identified as such by our
algorithm is calculated as a function of redshift, signal-to-noise ratio and
BAL properties. Second, the different completenesses of the SDSS target
selection algorithm for BALQSOs and non-BAL quasars are quantified. Accounting
for these selection effects the intrinsic CIV BALQSO fraction is 41+/-5 per
cent. Our analysis of the selection effects allows us to measure the dependence
of the intrinsic CIV BALQSO fraction on luminosity and redshift. We find a
factor of 3.5+/-0.4 decrease in the intrinsic fraction from the highest
redshifts, z~4.0, down to z~2.0. The redshift dependence implies that an
orientation effect alone is not sufficient to explain the presence of BAL
troughs in some but not all quasar spectra. Our results are consistent with the
intrinsic BALQSO fraction having no strong luminosity dependence, although with
3-sigma limits on the rate of change of the intrinsic fraction with luminosity
of -6.9 and 7.0 per cent dex^-1 we are unable to rule out such a dependence.

separated by a stationary shock. The dynamics is based on solutions of
relativistic magnetic reconnection with a guide field from Lyubarsky (2005).
Electron distributions in each region are chosen to the match the pressure and
density of the local plasma. Synchrotron emission from both regions is used to
calculate Compton scattering, Compton drag and photon-photon opacity effects,
with exact treatment of anisotropy and the Klein-Nishina regime. Radiative
effects on plasma are taken into account, including the dependence of pressure
on electron radiative losses and adiabatic heating of the flow decelerating
under Compton drag. The results are applied to the July 2006 flare in the BL
Lac object PKS 2155-304, with the aim of matching TeV flux measurements by
H.E.S.S. with models that satisfy the variability constraints, while keeping
X-ray emission below simultaneous Chandra observations. We find that models of
isolated minijets with a significant guide field overproduce X-ray emission,
and that we must take into account the radiative interaction of
oppositely-oriented minijets in order to achieve a high enough dominance by
Comptonized TeV radiation. We argue that such interactions are likely to occur
in a jet where there is substantial internal reconnection, producing a large
number of misaligned minijets. Finally, we show that large jet magnetizations
are indeed required to satisfy all observational constraints and that the
effective Lorentz factor of the minijet plasma has to be larger than 50, in

1250AU. Here we present new deep Gemini imaging and spectroscopy for the system
covering the wavelength regime from 1-12mu as well as Sub-Millimeter Array
interferometry at 870mu, in combination with Spitzer and literature data.
Object AB is a low-mass star with a disk/envelope system and an outflow cavity,
which is prominently seen in infrared images. Object C, previously suspected to
be a brown dwarf, is likely a very low mass star, with an effective temperature
of ~3400K. It features an edge-on disk and an elongated envelope, and shows
strong indications for accretion and ejection activity. Both objects are likely
to drive parsec-scale molecular outflows. The two objects are embedded in an
isolated, dense molecular cloud core. High extinction, lack of X-ray emission,
and relatively high bolometric luminosity argue for a very young age below
1Myr. The disk/outflow systems of AB and C are misaligned by ~60deg against
each other and by 80 and 40deg against the orbital plane of the binary. The
system might be a good case for primordial misalignment, as opposed to
misalignment caused by dynamical interactions, because the outflow direction is
constant and the realignment timescale is likely larger than the system age.
This favours turbulent fragmentation, rather than rotational fragmentation, as
the formation scenario. We show that the spectral energy distributions and
images for the two objects can be reproduced with radiative transfer models for
disk/envelope systems. Our analysis provides reassurance in the established
paradigm for the structure and early evolution of YSOs, but stresses the
importance of developing 3D models with sophisticated dust chemistry

spacetime using the holographic gauge/gravity duality. The main motivation for
this is to explore the possibility of dynamical phase transitions during
cosmological evolution. Specifically, we study two classes of theories: (i)
conformal field theories on de Sitter in the static patch which are maintained
in equilibrium at temperatures that may differ from the de Sitter temperature
and (ii) confining gauge theories on de Sitter spacetime. In the former case we
show the such states make sense from the holographic viewpoint in that they
have regular bulk gravity solutions. In the latter situation we add to the
evidence for a confinement/deconfinement transition for a large N planar gauge
theory as the cosmological acceleration is increased past a critical value. For
the field theories we study, the critical acceleration corresponds to a de
Sitter temperature which is less than the Minkowski space deconfinement
transition temperature by a factor of the spacetime dimension.

However, recently it was also suggested that if the innermost neutron-rich or

changed, and normal SNe may also reproduce the observations of EMP stars. In
this letter, we calculate explosive nucleosynthesis with various Ye and
entropy, and investigate whether normal SNe with this innermost matter, which
we call ""hot-bubble"" component, can reproduce the abundance of EMP stars. We
find that neutron-rich (Ye = 0.45-0.49) and proton-rich (Ye = 0.51-0.55) matter
can increase Zn/Fe and Co/Fe ratios as observed, but tend to overproduce other
Fe-peak elements. In addition to it, we find that if slightly proton-rich
matter with 0.50 <= Ye < 0.501 with s/kb ~ 15-40 is ejected as much as ~ 0.06
Msolar, even normal SNe can reproduce the abundance of EMP stars, though it
requires fine-tuning of Ye. On the other hand, HNe can more easily reproduce
the observations of EMP stars without fine-tuning. Our results imply that HNe
are the most possible origin of the abundance pattern of EMP stars.

graph property P consists in deciding whether there exists a set of edges F of
size at most k such that the graph H = (V,E \vartriangle F) satisfies the
property P. In the P edge-completion problem, the set F of edges is constrained
to be disjoint from E; in the P edge-deletion problem, F is a subset of E; no
constraint is imposed on F in the P edge-edition problem. A number of
optimization problems can be expressed in terms of graph modification problems
which have been extensively studied in the context of parameterized complexity.
When parameterized by the size k of the edge set F, it has been proved that if
P is an hereditary property characterized by a finite set of forbidden induced
subgraphs, then the three P edge-modification problems are FPT. It was then
natural to ask whether these problems also admit a polynomial size kernel.
Using recent lower bound techniques, Kratsch and Wahlstrom answered this
question negatively. However, the problem remains open on many natural graph
classes characterized by forbidden induced subgraphs. Kratsch and Wahlstrom
asked whether the result holds when the forbidden subgraphs are paths or cycles
and pointed out that the problem is already open in the case of P4-free graphs
(i.e. cographs). This paper provides positive and negative results in that line
of research. We prove that parameterized cograph edge modification problems
have cubic vertex kernels whereas polynomial kernels are unlikely to exist for
the Pl-free and Cl-free edge-deletion problems for large enough l.

received some attention in the recent past. We consider the complementary, and
yet unexplored, case of theories predicting much softer missing energy spectra.
As there is enough scope for such models to fake each other by having similar
final states at the LHC, we have outlined a systematic method based on a
combination of different kinematic features which can be used to distinguish
among different possibilities. These features often trace back to the
underlying mass spectrum and the spins of the new particles present in these
models. As examples of ""low missing energy look-alikes"", we consider
Supersymmetry with R-parity violation, Universal Extra Dimensions with both
KK-parity conserved and KK-parity violated and the Littlest Higgs model with
T-parity violated by the Wess-Zumino-Witten anomaly term. Through detailed
Monte Carlo analysis of the four and higher lepton final states predicted by
these models, we show that the models in their minimal forms may be
distinguished at the LHC, while non-minimal variations can always leave scope
for further confusion. We find that, for strongly interacting new particle
mass-scale ~600 GeV (1 TeV), the simplest versions of the different theories
can be discriminated at the LHC running at sqrt{s}=14 TeV within an integrated
luminosity of 5 (30) fb^{-1}.

investigate the spatial distribution of low and high surface brightness
galaxies (LSBGs and HSBGs, respectively). In particular, we focus our attention
on the influence of interactions between galaxies on the star formation
strength in the redshift range $0.01 < z < 0.1$. With cylinder counts and
projected distance to the first and fifth-nearest neighbor as environment
tracers, we find that LSBGs tend to have a lack of companions compared to HSBGs
at small scales ($<2$ Mpc). Regarding the interactions, we have evidence that
the fraction of LSBGs with strong star formation activity increases when the
distance between pairs of galaxies ($r_{p}$) is smaller than about four times
the Petrosian radius ($r_{90}$) of one of the components. Our results suggest
that, rather than being a condition for their formation, the isolation of LSBGs
is more connected with their survival and evolution. The effect of the
interaction on the star formation strength, measured by the average value of
the birthrate parameter $b$, seems to be stronger for HSBGs than for LSBGs. The
analysis of our population of LSBGs and HSBGs hosting an AGN show that,
regardless of the mass range, the fraction of LSBGs having an AGN is lower than
the corresponding fraction of HSBGs with an AGN. Also, we observe that the
fraction of HSBGs and LSBGs having an AGN increases with the bulge luminosity.
These results, and those concerning the star-forming properties of LSBGs as a
function of the environment, fit with the scenario proposed by some authors
where, below a given threshold of surface mass density, low surface brightness
disks are unable to propagate instabilities, preventing the formation and
evolution of massive black holes in the centers of LSBGs.

Wilson coefficient C_10 that is otherwise only accessible through complicated
CP violating asymmetries. We illustrate the new physics sensitivity of this
observable within the context of few extensions of the Standard Model, namely
the SM with four generations, an MSSM with non--vanishing source of flavor

meteorites in the form of variations in the isotopic abundance of 54Cr, the
most neutron-rich stable isotope of chromium. The hosts of these isotopic
anomalies must be presolar grains that condensed in the outflows of supernovae,
offering the opportunity to study the nucleosynthesis of iron-peak nuclei in
ways that complement spectroscopic observations and can inform models of
stellar evolution. However, despite almost two decades of extensive search, the
carrier of 54Cr anomalies is still unknown, presumably because it is
fine-grained and is chemically labile. Here we identify in the primitive
meteorite Orgueil the carrier of 54Cr-anomalies as nanoparticles, most likely
spinels that show large enrichments in 54Cr relative to solar composition
(54Cr/52Cr ratio >3.6xsolar). Such large enrichments in 54Cr can only be
produced in supernovae. The mineralogy of the grains supports condensation in
the O/Ne-O/C zones of a type II supernova, although a type Ia origin cannot be
excluded. We suggest that planetary materials incorporated different amounts of
these nanoparticles, possibly due to late injection by a nearby supernova that
also delivered 26Al and 60Fe to the solar system. This idea explains why the
relative abundance of 54Cr and other neutron-rich isotopes vary between planets
and meteorites. We anticipate that future isotopic studies of the grains
identified here will shed new light on the birth of the solar system and the
conditions insupernovae.

exhibit low rotational velocities, abundance anomalies (as compared to cluster
abundances), photometric jumps and gaps and spectroscopic gravities lower than
predicted by canonical models. It is commonly believed that the low rotational
velocities of these stars permit atomic diffusion to be efficient in their
atmosphere thereby causing the observed anomalies. Recent detections of
vertical stratification of iron (and some other chemical elements) in several
BHB stars concur with this framework. In this paper, improved model atmospheres
that include the vertical stratification of the elements are applied to BHB
stars to verify if they can explain their observational anomalies. The results
from theoretical model atmospheres are consistent with the photometric jumps
and gaps observed for BHB stars in globular clusters. It is found that iron
stratification in the theoretical models and that obtained from observations
have similar tendancies. Our results also show that the spectroscopic gravities
obtained while using chemically homogeneous model atmospheres to fit
observations are underestimated. These results significantly strengthen the
belief that atomic diffusion is responsible for these BHB-star anomalies.

disjoint regions which are characterized by the distinct behaviors of the
solution for large time: blow-up, scattering to 0, or scattering to the family
of ground states generated by the phase and scaling freedom. Solutions of this
latter type form a smooth center-stable manifold, which contains the ground
states and separates the phase space locally into two connected regions
exhibiting blow-up and scattering to 0, respectively. The special solutions
found by Duyckaerts and Roudenko appear here as the unique one-dimensional
unstable/stable manifolds emanating from the ground states. In analogy with the
Klein-Gordon case, the proof combines the hyperbolic dynamics near the ground
states with the variational structure away from them. The main technical
ingredient in the proof is a ""one-pass"" theorem which precludes ""almost
homoclinic orbits"", i.e., those solutions starting in, then moving away from,
and finally returning to, a small neighborhood of the ground states. The main
new difficulty compared with the Klein-Gordon case is the lack of finite
propagation speed. We need the radial Sobolev inequality for the error estimate
in the virial argument. Another major difference from the Klein-Gordon case is
the need to control two modulation parameters.

correlations. These are responsible for the intimate connection between high
and low-energy scale physics, and their key role in the mechanism of HTSC was
conjectured very early on. More recently, the detection of quantum oscillations
in high-magnetic field experiments on YBa2Cu3O6+x (YBCO) has suggested the
existence of a Fermi surface of well-defined quasiparticles in underdoped
cuprates, lending support to the alternative proposal that HTSC might emerge
from a Fermi liquid across the whole cuprate phase diagram. Discriminating
between these orthogonal scenarios hinges on the quantitative determination of
the elusive quasiparticle weight Z, over a wide range of hole-doping p. By
means of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) on in situ doped
YBCO, and following the evolution of bilayer band-splitting, we show that the
overdoped metal electronic structure (0.25<p<0.37) is in remarkable agreement
with density functional theory and the Z=2p/(p+1) mean-field prediction. Below

this marks a clear departure from Fermi liquid behaviour and -- consistent with

state is coupled to a vortex state with mesoscopic angular momentum by means of
a narrow potential barrier and an applied phase that originates from either
rotation or a synthetic magnetic field. We show that superposition states in
the Tonks-Girardeau regime are robust against single-particle loss due to the
effects of strong correlations. The coupling between the mesoscopically
distinct states scales much more favorably with particle number than in schemes
relying on weak interactions, thus making particle numbers of hundreds or
thousands feasible. Coherent oscillations induced by time variation of
parameters may serve as a 'smoking gun' signature for detecting superposition
states.

the spectral measure of a suitably chosen sub-Laplacian. We prove that the

the most successful learning methods since more than a decade. SVMs can
informally be described as a kind of regularized M-estimators for functions and
have demonstrated their usefulness in many complicated real-life problems.
During the last years a great part of the statistical research on SVMs has
concentrated on the question how to design SVMs such that they are universally
consistent and statistically robust for nonparametric classification or
nonparametric regression purposes. In many applications, some qualitative prior
knowledge of the distribution P or of the unknown function f to be estimated is
present or the prediction function with a good interpretability is desired,
such that a semiparametric model or an additive model is of interest.
  In this paper we mainly address the question how to design SVMs by choosing
the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) or its corresponding kernel to
obtain consistent and statistically robust estimators in additive models. We
give an explicit construction of kernels - and thus of their RKHSs - which
leads in combination with a Lipschitz continuous loss function to consistent
and statistically robust SMVs for additive models. Examples are quantile
regression based on the pinball loss function, regression based on the
epsilon-insensitive loss function, and classification based on the hinge loss
function.

Abundances of carbon were studied using the C2 Swan (0,1) band head at 5635.5

order to determine nitrogen abundances and 12C/13C isotope ratios. The oxygen
abundances were determined from the [O I] line at 6300 A. Compared with the Sun
and dwarf stars of the Galactic disk, mean abundances in the investigated clump
stars suggest that carbon is depleted by about 0.2 dex, nitrogen is enhanced by
0.2 dex and oxygen is close to abundances in dwarfs. Comparisons to
evolutionary models show that the stars fall into two groups: the one is of
first ascent giants with carbon isotope ratios altered according to the first
dredge-up prediction, and the other one is of helium-core-burning stars with
carbon isotope ratios altered by extra mixing. The stars investigated fall to
these groups in approximately equal numbers.

Fornacis, both mechanisms of magnetic activity cycles in the late-type

from global HI line widths to TFRs derived from the circular velocity profiles
of dynamical models (or stellar kinematic observations corrected for asymmetric
drift) is vulnerable to systematic and uncertain biases introduced by the
different measures of rotation used. We therefore argue that to constrain the
relative locations of the TFRs of spiral and S0 galaxies, the same tracer and
measure must be used for both samples. Using detailed near-infrared imaging and
the circular velocities of axisymmetric Jeans models of 14 nearby edge-on Sa-Sb
spirals and 14 nearby edge-on S0s drawn from a range of environments, we find
that S0s lie on a TFR with the same slope as the spirals, but are on average
0.53+/-0.15 mag fainter at Ks-band at a given rotational velocity. This is a
significantly smaller offset than that measured in earlier studies of the S0
TFR, which we attribute to our elimination of the bias associated with using
different rotation measures and our use of earlier type spirals as a reference.
Since our measurement of the offset avoids systematic biases, it should be
preferred to previous estimates. A spiral stellar population in which star
formation is truncated would take ~1 Gyr to fade by 0.53 mag at Ks-band. If S0s
are the products of a simple truncation of star formation in spirals, then this
finding is difficult to reconcile with the observed evolution of the spiral/S0
fraction with redshift. Recent star formation could explain the observed lack
of fading in S0s, but the offset of the S0 TFR persists as a function of both
stellar and dynamical mass. We show that the offset of the S0 TFR could
therefore be explained by a systematic difference between the total mass
distributions of S0s and spirals, in the sense that S0s need to be smaller or
more concentrated than spirals.

To
further constrain current theories, it is vital to spatially resolve the
structures from which material accretes onto massive young stellar objects
(MYSOs). Due to the small angular extent of MYSOs, one needs to overcome the
limitations of conventional thermal infrared imaging, regarding spatial
resolution, in order to get observational access to the inner structure of
these objects.We employed mid - infrared interferometry, using the MIDI
instrument on the ESO /VLTI, to investigate the Kleinmann - Wright Object, a
massive young stellar object previously identified as a Herbig Be star
precursor. Dispersed visibility curves in the N- band (8 - 13 {\mu}m) have been
obtained at 5 interferometric baselines. We show that the mid - infrared
emission region is resolved. A qualitative analysis of the data indicates a non
- rotationally symmetric structure, e.g. the projection of an inclined disk. We
employed extensive radiative transfer simulations based on spectral energy
distribution fitting. Since SED - only fitting usually yields degenerate
results, we first employed a statistical analysis of the parameters provided by
the radiative transfer models. In addition, we compared the ten best - fitting
self - consistent models to the interferometric observations. Our analysis of
the Kleinmann - Wright Object suggests the existence of a circumstellar disk of
0.1M\odot at an intermediate inclination of 76\circ, while an additional dusty
envelope is not necessary for fitting the data. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that the combination of IR interferometry with radiative transfer simulations
has the potential to resolve ambiguities arising from the analysis of spectral
energy distributions alone.

Collaboration (LSC) obtained an upper limit on the stochastic

two-year science run of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational- wave
Observatory (LIGO). Such an upper limit rules out some models of early Universe
evolution, like the ones with relatively large equation-of-state parameter and
the cosmic (super) string models with relatively small string tension arising
from some String Theory's models. It results also an upper limit for the relic
stochastic background of gravitational waves (RSBGWs) which is proposed by the
Pre-Big-Bang Theory. On the other hand, the upper bound on the RSBGWs which is
proposed by the Standard Inflationary Model is well known and often updated by
using the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP). The potential detection
of such a RSBGWs is the only way to learn about the evolution of the very early
universe, up to the bounds of the Planck epoch and the initial singularity.
This is a kind of information that is inaccessible to standard astrophysical
observations. By using a conformal treatment, a formula that directly connects
the average amplitude of the RSBGWs with the Inflaton field has been re- cently
obtained in our paper Gen. Rel. Grav. 42, 5, 1323-1333 (2010). In this
proceeding, by joining this formula with the equation for the characteristic
amplitude hC for the RSBGWs, the upper bounds on the RSBGWs from the WMAP and
LSC data will be translated in lower bounds on the Inflaton field. The results
show that the value of the Inflaton field that arises from the WMAP bound on
the RSBGWs is totally in agreement with the famous slow roll condition on
Inflation, while the value of the Inflaton field that arises from the LSC bound
on the RSBGWs could be not in agreement with such a condition.

particles with integer spin (bosons) at low temperature and high density, has
been observed in several physical systems, including cold atomic gases and
solid state physics quasiparticles. However, the most omnipresent Bose gas,
blackbody radiation (radiation in thermal equilibrium with the cavity walls)
does not show this phase transition, because the chemical potential of photons
vanishes and, when the temperature is reduced, photons disappear in the cavity
walls. Theoretical works have considered photon number conserving
thermalization processes, a prerequisite for Bose-Einstein condensation, using
Compton scattering with a gas of thermal electrons, or using photon-photon
scattering in a nonlinear resonator configuration. In a recent experiment, we
have observed number conserving thermalization of a two-dimensional photon gas
in a dye-filled optical microcavity, acting as a 'white-wall' box for photons.
Here we report on the observation of a Bose-Einstein condensation of photons in
a dye-filled optical microcavity. The cavity mirrors provide both a confining
potential and a non-vanishing effective photon mass, making the system formally
equivalent to a two-dimensional gas of trapped, massive bosons. By multiple
scattering off the dye molecules, the photons thermalize to the temperature of
the dye solution (room temperature). Upon increasing the photon density we
observe the following signatures for a BEC of photons: Bose-Einstein
distributed photon energies with a massively populated ground state mode on top
of a broad thermal wing, the phase transition occurring both at the expected
value and exhibiting the predicted cavity geometry dependence, and the ground
state mode emerging even for a spatially displaced pump spot.

Analysis (TSPA) method. Our improvements are the use of a sliding window in
choosing the modelled datasets, a criterion applied to select the best model
for each dataset and the computation of the time scale of change of the light
curve. We test the performance of CPS with simulated and real data. The CPS has
a much improved time resolution which allows us to better investigate fast
evolution of stellar light curves. We can also separate between the cases when
the data is best described by periodic and aperiodic (e.g. constant brightness)
models. We find, however, that the performance of the CPS has certain
limitations. It does not determine the correct model complexity in all cases,
especially when the underlying light curve is constant and the number of
observations too small. Also the sensitivity in detecting two close light curve
minima is limited and it has a certain amount of intrinsic instability in its
period estimation. Using the CPS, we find persistent active longitudes in the
star HD 116956 and a ""flip-flop"" event that occurred during the year 1999.
Assuming that the surface differential rotation of the star causes observable
period variations in the stellar light curve, we determine the differential
rotation coefficient to be |k|>0.11. The mean timescale of change of the light
curve during the whole 12 year observing period was T_C=44.1 d, which is of the

the discretisation of the fundamental equations. The issue of accurate balance
representation is particularly challenging when applying dynamic mesh
adaptivity, where there is potential for additional imbalance injection when
interpolating to new, optimised meshes.
  In the context of shallow-water modelling, we present a new method for
preservation of geostrophic balance when applying dynamic mesh adaptivity. This
approach is based upon interpolation of the Helmholtz decomposition of the
Coriolis acceleration. We apply this in combination with a discretisation for
which states in geostrophic balance are exactly steady solutions of the
linearised equations on an f-plane; this method guarantees that a balanced and
steady flow on a donor mesh remains balanced and steady after interpolation
onto an arbitrary target mesh, to within machine precision. We further
demonstrate the utility of this interpolant for states close to geostrophic
balance, and show that it prevents pollution of the resulting solutions by
imbalanced perturbations introduced by the interpolation.

acids as nodes and the interactions among them as edges we have constructed and
analyzed protein contact networks at different length scales, long and
short-range. While long and short-range interactions are determined by the
positions of amino acids in primary chain, the contact networks are constructed
based on the 3D spatial distances of amino acids. We have further divided these
networks into sub-networks of hydrophobic, hydrophilic and charged residues.
Our analysis reveals that a significantly higher percentage of assortative
sub-clusters of long-range hydrophobic networks helps a protein in
communicating the necessary information for protein folding in one hand; on the
other hand the higher values of clustering coefficients of hydrophobic
sub-clusters play a major role in slowing down the process so that necessary
local and global stability can be achieved through intra connectivities of the
amino acid residues. Further, higher degrees of hydrophobic long-range
interactions suggest their greater role in protein folding and stability. The
small-range all amino acids networks have signature of hierarchy. The present
analysis with other evidences suggest that in a protein's 3D conformational
space, the growth of connectivity is not evolved either through preferential
attachment or through random connections; rather, it follows a specific
structural necessity based guiding principle - where some of the interactions
are primary while the others, generated as a consequence of these primary
interactions are secondary.

analyze theoretically the relationship between the C_0 correlation and the

arguments of energy conservation. This derivation leads to a clear physical

show that C_0 is essentially a correlation resulting from near-field

C_0, that confers to this correlation a huge potential for sensing and imaging
at the subwavelength scale in complex media.

support, its radial velocity is measured to be RV_3=70(8) km s^-1. The orbit of
the binary system is proved to be eccentric (e=0.059) and thus the apsidal
motion exists. The estimated linear advance in longitude of periastron
corresponds to an apsidal motion of U=694+/-5 yr for the system. The average
internal structure constant log k_2,obs=-2.53 of LT CMa is found smaller than
its theoretical value of log k_2,theo=-2.22 suggesting the stars would have
more central concentration in mass. The photometric distance of LT CMa
(d=535+/-45 pc) is found to be much smaller than the distance of CMa OB1

is much older than the CMa OB1 association (3 Myr), confirming that LT CMa is

more likely, while for negative $w$ the opposite holds. Setting $w$ equal to

that increasing the probability of adopting the strategy from the fittest
player within reach, i.e. setting $w$ positive, promotes the evolution of
cooperation. The robustness of this observation is tested against different
levels of uncertainty in the strategy adoption process and for different
interaction network. Since the evolution to widespread defection is tightly
associated with cooperators having a lower fitness than defectors, the fact
that positive values of $w$ facilitate cooperation is quite surprising. We show
that the results can be explained by means of a negative feedback effect that
increases the vulnerability of defectors although initially increasing their
survivability. Moreover, we demonstrate that the introduction of $w$
effectively alters the interaction network and thus also the impact of
uncertainty by strategy adoptions on the evolution of cooperation.

identify these lines in CRIRES spectra of the magnetically inactive, slowly

spectral region with theoretical FeH line data. In general this line list
agrees with the observed data, but several individual lines differ
significantly in position or in line strength. After identification of as many
as possible FeH lines, we correct the line data for position and line strength
to provide an accurate atlas of FeH absorption lines for use in high precision
spectroscopy of low mass stars. For all lines, we use a Voigt function to
obtain their positions and equivalent widths. Identification with theoretical
lines is done by hand. For confirmation of the identified lines, we use
statistical methods, cross- correlation techniques, and line intensities.
Eventually, we were able to identify FeH lines from the (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1),
(2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), and (4, 3) vibrational bands in the observed spectra

around zero. In order to empirically correct the line strength, we determined
Teff, instrumental broadening (rotational broadening) and a van der Waals

star-forming regions which may help understand the earliest stages of massive
star formation. We present Herschel-HIFI observations of the para-H2O 1_11-0_00
and 2_02-1_11 and the para-H2-18O 1_11-0_00 transitions. The envelope
contribution to the line profiles is separated from contributions by outflows
and foreground clouds. The envelope contribution is modelled using Monte-Carlo
radiative transfer codes for dust and molecular lines (MC3D and RATRAN), with
the water abundance and the turbulent velocity width as free parameters. While
the outflows are mostly seen in emission in high-J lines, envelopes are seen in
absorption in ground-state lines, which are almost saturated. The derived water
abundances range from 5E-10 to 4E-8 in the outer envelopes. We detect cold
clouds surrounding the protostar envelope, thanks to the very high quality of
the Herschel-HIFI data and the unique ability of water to probe them. Several
foreground clouds are also detected along the line of sight. The low H2O
abundances in massive dense cores are in accordance with the expectation that
high densities and low temperatures lead to freeze-out of water on dust grains.
The spread in abundance values is not clearly linked to physical properties of
the sources.

The noisy code is defined by partitioning the space of symbols into regions
according to their meanings. The ""polymers"" are the boundaries between these
regions and their statistics defines the cost and the quality of the noisy
code. When the parameters that control the cost-quality balance are varied, the
polymer network undergoes a first-order transition, where the number of encoded
meanings rises discontinuously. Effects of population dynamics on the evolution
of molecular codes are discussed.

amino-acids. Some argue that the specific form of the code with its twenty
amino-acids might be a 'frozen accident' because of the overwhelming effects of
any further change. Others see it as a consequence of primordial biochemical
pathways and their evolution. Here we examine a scenario in which evolution
drives the emergence of a genetic code by selecting for an amino-acid map that
minimizes the impact of errors. We treat the stochastic mapping of codons to
amino-acids as a noisy information channel with a natural fitness measure.
Organisms compete by the fitness of their codes and, as a result, a genetic
code emerges at a supercritical transition in the noisy channel, when the
mapping of codons to amino-acids becomes nonrandom. At the phase transition, a
small expansion is valid and the emergent code is governed by smooth modes of
the Laplacian of errors. These modes are in turn governed by the topology of
the error-graph, in which codons are connected if they are likely to be
confused. This topology sets an upper bound - which is related to the classical
map-coloring problem - on the number of possible amino-acids. The suggested
scenario is generic and may describe a mechanism for the formation of other
error-prone biological codes, such as the recognition of DNA sites by proteins
in the transcription regulatory network.

  The accelerated expansion of the Universe, which is today observed, shows
that cosmological dynamics is dominated by the so-called Dark Energy field
which provides a large negative pressure. This is the standard picture, in
which such new ingredient is considered as a source of the right hand side of
the field equations. It should be some form of non-clustered non-zero vacuum
energy which, together with the clustered Dark Matter, drives the global
dynamics. This is the so-called ""concordance model"" (ACDM) which gives, in
agreement with the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR), dim Lyman
Limit Systems (LLS) and type la supernovae (SNeIa) data, a good framework to
understand the today observed Universe. However, it presents several
shortcomings as the well known ""coincidence"" and ""cosmological constant""
problems . An alternative approach is to have a better understanding of the
energy concept in General Relativity and also to change the left hand side of
the field equations, and check if observed cosmic dynamics can be achieved by
extending general relativity. In this different context, it is not required to
search candidates for Dark Energy and Dark Matter, which till now have not been
found. Rather, one can only stand on the ""observed"" ingredients: curvature and
baryon matter, to account for the observations. Considering this point of view,
one can think of that gravity is not scale-invariant. The goal of this
Symposium is to obtain a tapestry of the present status of theory and
observations concerning Gravitation and Dark Universe.

M\odot of molecular gas distributed primarily in central discs or rings (radii
0.5 to 4 kpc). The molecular gas distributions are always coincident with
distributions of optically-obscuring dust that reveal tightly-wound spiral
structures in many cases. The ionised gas always approximately corotates with
the molecular gas, evidencing a link between these two gas components, yet star
formation is not always the domi- nant ionisation source. The galaxies with
less molecular gas tend to have [O III]/H{\beta} emission-line ratios at high
values not expected for star formation. Most E/S0s with molecular gas have
young or intermediate age stellar populations based on optical colours,
ultraviolet colours and absorption linestrengths. The few that appear purely
old lie close to the limit where such populations would be undetectable based
on the mass fractions of expected young to observed old stars. The 8{\mu}m
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and 24{\mu}m emission yield similar star
formation rate estimates of E/S0s, but the total infrared overpredicts the rate
due to a contribution to dust heating from older stars. The radio-far infrared
relation also has much more scatter than for other star-forming galaxies.
However, despite these biases and additional scatter, the derived star
formation rates locate the E/S0 galaxies within the large range of the
Schmidt-Kennicutt and constant efficiency star formation laws. Thus the star
formation process in E/S0s is not overwhelmingly different than in other
star-forming galaxies, although one of the more reliable tracers (24{\mu}m)
points to a possible lower star-formation efficiency at a given gas surface
density.

tidal shear and evaporation due to stellar irradiation peel off the outer

leave behind a torus of hot, dense matter orbiting around the black hole. While
numerical-relativity simulations are necessary to simulate this process
accurately, they are also computationally expensive and unable at present to
cover the large space of possible parameters, which include the relative mass
ratio, the stellar compactness, and the black hole spin. To mitigate this and
provide a first reasonable coverage of the space of parameters, we have
developed a method for estimating the mass of the remnant torus from black
hole-neutron star mergers. The toy model makes use of an improved relativistic
affine model to describe the tidal deformations of an extended tri-axial
ellipsoid orbiting around a Kerr black hole and measures the mass of the
remnant torus by considering which of the fluid particles composing the star
are on bound orbits at the time of the tidal disruption. We tune the toy model
by using the results of fully general-relativistic simulations obtaining
relative precisions of a few percent and use it to extensively investigate the
space of parameters. In this way we find that the torus mass is largest for
systems with highly spinning black holes, small stellar compactnesses, and
large mass ratios. As an example, tori as massive as ~1.33 solar masses can be
produced for a very extended star with compactness of ~0.1 inspiralling around
a black hole with dimensionless spin equal to 0.85 and mass ratio of about 0.3.
However, for a more astrophysically reasonable mass ratio of ~0.14 and a
canonical value of the stellar compactness of ~0.145, the toy model sets a
considerably smaller upper limit to the torus mass of less than ~0.34 solar

regime. Recent numerical simulations [Q.-Q. Shi, R. Or\'us, J. O. Fj\ae restad
and H.-Q Zhou, New J. Phys. {\bf 12}, 025008 (2010)] indicate that it scales
linearly with system size, and that the first subleading correction is
constant, which was argued to be possibly universal. In this work, we confirm
the universality of this number, by relating it to the Affleck-Ludwig boundary
entropy corresponding to a Neumann boundary condition for a free compactified
field. We find that the subleading constant is a simple function of the
compactification radius, in agreement with the numerics. As a further check, we
compute it exactly on the lattice at the XX point. We also discuss the case of
the Ising chain in transverse field and show that the geometrical entanglement
is related to the Affleck-Ludwig boundary entropy associated to a ferromagnetic
boundary condition.

suggested that grains can grow and sediment inside giant planet embryos formed
at R ~ 5 AU away from the star. Several authors since then criticised the
suggestion. Convection may prevent grain sedimentation, and the embryos cannot
even form so close to the parent star as cooling is too inefficient at these
distances. Here we reconsider the grain sedimentation process suggested by Boss
(1998) but inside an embryo formed, as expected in the light of the cooling
constraints, at R ~ 100 AU. Such embryos are much less dense and are also
cooler. We make analytical estimates of the process and also perform simple
spherically symmetric radiation hydrodynamics simulations to test these ideas.
We find that convection in our models does not become important before a
somewhat massive (~ an Earth mass, this is clarified in a followup paper) solid
core is built. Turbulent mixing slows down dust sedimentation but is
overwhelmed by grain sedimentation when the latter grow to a centimetres size.
The minimum time required for dust sedimentation to occur is a few thousand
years, and is a strong function of the embryo's mass, dust content and opacity.
An approximate analytical criterion is given to delineate conditions in which a
giant embryo contracts and heats up faster than dust can sediment. As Boss et
al (2002), we argue that core formation through grain sedimentation inside the
giant planet embryos may yield an unexplored route to form giant gas and giant
ice planets. The present model also stands at the basis of paper III, where we
study the possibility of forming terrestrial planet cores by tidal disruption
and photoevaporation of the planetary envelope.

in massive extended (R ~ 100 AU) protostellar discs. In a recent paper we have
shown that dust can sediment inside the embryos, as argued earlier by Boss
(1998) in a slightly different model. Here we study numerically the next stage
of this process -- the formation of a solid core. If conditions are conducive
to solid core formation, the centre of the gas cloud goes through the following
sequence of phases: (i) becomes grain (and metal) rich; (ii) forms a
terrestrial mass solid core via a rapid collapse driven by self-gravity of the
grains; (iii) starts to accrete a gaseous atmosphere when the solid core
reaches mass of a few to 10 Earth masses. This sequence of events may build
either terrestrial planet cores or metal rich giant planets inside the larger
gas reservoir of the giant planet embryo. In a companion Letter we argue that
tidal and irradiation effects from the parent star should disrupt the outer
metal poor layers of the embryo, releasing nearly ""ready to use"" planets. We
propose this as an alternative way to build planets.
