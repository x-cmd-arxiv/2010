morphisms between these maps. The adjoint-morphisms between bilinear maps
establish a complete abelian category with projectives and admits a duality.
Thus the adjoint category is not a module category but nevertheless it is
suitably familiar. The universal properties have geometric perspectives. For
example, products are orthogonal sums. The bilinear division maps are the
simple bimaps with respect to nondegenerate adjoint-morphisms. That formalizes
the understanding that the atoms of linear geometries are algebraic objects
with no zero-divisors. Adjoint-isomorphism coincides with principal isotopism;
hence, nonassociative division rings can be studied within this framework.
  This also corrects an error in an earlier pre-print; see Remark 2.11.

studied. With the equations of motion of the particles, the center-of-mass
energy is investigated when the collision takes place at the horizon of a Sen
black hole. For an extremal Sen black hole, we find that the center-of-mass
energy will be arbitrarily high with two conditions: (1) spin $a\neq 0$ and (2)
one of the colliding particles has the critical angular momentum
$l_{\text{c}}=2$. For a nonextremal Sen black hole, we show that, in order to
obtain an unlimited center-of-mass energy, one of the colliding particles
should have the critical angular momentum $l'_{\text{c}}=2 r_{+}/a$ ($r_{+}$ is
the radius of the outer horizon for a nonextremal black hole). However, a
particle with the angular momentum $l=l'_{\text{c}}$ could not approach the
black hole from outside of the horizon through free fall, which implies that
the collision with arbitrarily high center-of-mass energy could not take place.
Thus, there is an upper bound of the center-of-mass energy for the nonextremal
black hole. We also obtain the maximal center-of-mass energy for a
near-extremal black hole and the result implies that the Planck-scale energy is
hard to be approached. Furthermore, we also consider the back-reaction effects.
The result shows that, neglecting the gravitational radiation, it has a weak
effect on the center-of-mass energy. However, we argue that the maximum allowed
center-of-mass energy will be greatly reduced to below the Planck-scale when
the gravitational radiation is included.

holographically encoded into bulk-mass corrections for the tetraquark's dual
mode. The latter are argued to originate from the anomalous dimension of the
corresponding four-quark interpolator. To provide a concrete example, we
implement this mechanism into the dilaton soft-wall dual for holographic QCD.
Preventing the lowest-lying dual mode from collapsing into the AdS boundary
then establishes a rather generic lower bound on the tetraquark mass (which may
be overcome in the presence of additional background fields). We further
demonstrate that the higher tetraquark excitations can become heavier than
their quark-antiquark counterparts and are thus likely to dissolve into the
multiparticle continuum.

through a material and the associated interaction between laser and matter
(polarization of the atoms through light propagation, photon emission and
absorption, etc.). The laser field is described through Maxwell's equations, a
classical equation, while matter is represented at a quantum level and
satisfies a quantum Liouville equation known as the Bloch model. Coupling
between laser and matter is described through a quadratic source term in both
equations. The model also takes into account partial relaxation effects, namely
the trend of matter to return to its natural thermodynamic equilibrium. The
whole system involves $6$+$N \, (N+1)/2$ unknowns, the six-dimensional
electromagnetic field plus the $N \, (N+1)/2$ unknowns describing the state of
matter, where $N$ is the number of atomic energy levels of the considered
material. We consider at once a high-frequency and weak coupling situation, in
the general case of anisotropic electromagnetic fields that are subject to
diffraction. Degenerate energy levels are allowed. The whole system is stiff
and involves strong nonlinearities. We show the convergence to a nonstiff,
nonlinear, coupled Schr\""o\-din\-ger-Boltzmann model, involving $3$+$N$
unknowns. The electromagnetic field is eventually described through its
envelope, one unknown vector in $\C^3$. It satisfies a Schr\""o\-din\-ger
equation that takes into account propagation and diffraction of light inside
the material. Matter on the other hand is described through a $N$-dimensional
vector describing the occupation numbers of each atomic level. It satisfies a
Boltzmann equation that describes the jumps of the electrons between the
various atomic energy levels, as induced by the interaction with light. The
rate of exchange between the atomic levels is proportional to the intensity of
the laser field. The whole system is the physically natural nonlinear model. In
order to provide an important and explicit example, we completely analyze the
specific (two dimensional) Transverse Magnetic case, for which formulae turn
out to be simpler. Technically speaking, our analysis does not enter the usual
mathematical framework of geometric optics: it is more singular, and requires
an \emph{ad hoc} Ansatz.

difference of the best fit values of $\omm$ between the two hemispheres in the
context of \lcdm fits. We find a maximum anisotropy level in the Union2 data of
$\frac{\Delta \ommax}{\bomm}=0.43\pm 0.06$. Such a level does not necessarily
correspond to statistically significant anisotropy because it is reproduced by
about $30%$ of simulated isotropic data mimicking the best fit Union2 dataset.
However, when combined with the axes directions of other cosmological
observations (bulk velocity flow axis, three axes of CMB low multipole moments
and quasar optical polarization alignment axis), the statistical evidence for a
cosmological anisotropy increases dramatically. We estimate the probability
that the above independent six axes directions would be so close in the sky to
be less than $1%$. Thus either the relative coincidence of these six axes is a
very large statistical fluctuation or there is an underlying physical or
systematic reason that leads to their correlation.

we relate this application of SWSHs to a description of electromagnetic
radiation and polarization in the NP formalism. In particular we introduce NP
Stokes fields that are the NP equivalent of the Stokes parameters. In addition

combines each object's classical electromagnetic scattering amplitude with
universal translation matrices, which convert between the bases used to
calculate scattering for each object, but are otherwise independent of the

statistical physics and scattering theory, is well suited to analyze many
diverse phenomena. We illustrate its power and versatility by a number of

helps to understand and control Casimir forces. We also examine whether
electrodynamic Casimir forces can lead to stable levitation. Neglecting
permeabilities, we prove that any equilibrium position of objects subject to
such forces is unstable if the permittivities of all objects are higher or
lower than that of the enveloping medium; the former being the generic case for

long-term hard X-ray monitoring of 4U 2206+54 and detected a hard X-ray
outburst around 15 December 2005 combined with the RXTE/ASM data.The hard X-ray
outburst had a double-flare feature with a duration of $\sim$ 2 days. The first
flare showed a fast rise and long time decaying light curve about 15 hours with
a peak luminosity of $\sim 4\times 10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$ from 1.5 -- 12 keV and
a hard spectrum (only significantly seen above 5 keV). The second one had the
mean hard X-ray luminosity of $1.3\times 10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$ from 20 -- 150
keV with a modulation period at $\sim 5550$ s which is the pulse period of the
neutron star in 4U 2206+54; its hard X-ray spectrum from 20 -- 300 keV can be
fitted with a broken power-law model with the photon indexes $\Gamma_1 \sim
2.3,\ \Gamma_2 \sim 3.3$, and the break energy is $E_b \sim 31$ keV or a
bremsstrahlung model of $kT\sim 23$ keV. We suggest that the hard X-ray flare
could be induced by suddenly enhanced accretion dense materials from stellar
winds hitting the polar cap region of the neutron star. This hard X-ray
outburst may be a link to supergiant fast X-ray transients though 4U 2206+54
has a different type of companion.

Dynamical Model (DDM) of Ball Lightning (BL). The movement and energy supplying
to the dipole BL are due to the atmospheric electric field. Crucial for the
detailed analysis of BL is using the new relation of balance of the force of
atmospheric electric field (per unit mass of electron cloud) and dipole forces
electrons-ions within BL dipole (per unit mass of BL) as the first necessary
condition for the existance of BL as an integer. This model is unique because,
unlike existing static models, fundamental condition for the existence of Ball
Lightning is its forward motion. The virial theorem limiting BL power does not
apply to BL which is not closed system like the Sun or Galaxy systems and is
strongly dependent part of the infinitely extended in time and space large
system. Stability of BL is due to two free parameters with the fundamental role
of thermodynamic non-equilibrium, ionization, recombination and translational
movement with energy loss by radiation and also excess volumetric positive
charge. Stability of BL is not related to the presence of any external shells.
Polarization degree of BL plasma is characterized by polarizability factor
{\gamma}. An example is presented of calculating the stability of an option of
BL. There is also a possible connection of stability BL with statistical
distributions of the atmospheric electric field in time and space. Destruction
of BL can also occur due to arising kinematical instability at its accelerating
(or decelerating) movement. Maximal energy density in BL DDM does not exceed
the value Espec<(10(8) - 10(9)) J/m(3) decreasing with the growing BL radius.
Resulting indefinitely long BL lifetime is also discussed. BL has no outer
shell and no any inner rigid or elastic microstructure elements.

seconds; (3) a lack of transit-timing variations, excluding the presence of
second planets in this system above 20% of the mass of Mars in low-order
mean-motion resonance at 95% confidence; (4) a confirmation of the planet's
phase variation, finding the night side is 64% as bright as the day side, as
well as an upper limit on the night-side variability of 17% (68% confidence);
(5) a better correction for stellar variability at 8 micron causing the phase
function to peak 3.5 hrs before secondary eclipse, confirming that the
advection and radiation timescales are comparable at the 8 micron photosphere;
(6) variation in the depth of transit, which possibly implies variations in the
surface brightness of the portion of the star occulted by the planet, posing a
fundamental limit on non-simultaneous multi-wavelength transit absorption
measurements of planet atmospheres; (7) a measurement of the infrared
limb-darkening of the star, in agreement with stellar atmosphere models; (8) an
offset in the times of secondary eclipse of 69 sec, which is mostly accounted
for by a 31 sec light travel time delay and 33 sec delay due to the shift of
ingress and egress by the planet hot spot; this confirms that the phase
variation is due to an offset hot spot on the planet; (9) a retraction of the
claimed eccentricity of this system due to the offset of secondary eclipse; and
(10) high precision measurements of the parameters of this system.

well-constrained up to z~5. We find that Fermi may discover a few blazars up to

which are selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 5. The
spectra of E+As are prominently characterized by the strong Balmer absorption
lines but little [Oii] or H_alpha emission lines. In this work we study the
stellar populations of the sample galaxies by fitting their spectra using
ULySS, which is a robust full spectrum fitting method. We fit each of the
sample with 1-population (a single stellar population-a SSP) and 3-population
(3 SSPs) models, separately. By 1-population fits, we obtain SSP-equivalent
ages and metallicities which correspond to the `luminosity-weighted' averages.
By 3-population fits, we divide components into three groups in age (old
stellar population-OSP, intermediate-age stellar population-ISP, and young
stellar population-YSP), and then get the optimal age, metallicity and
population fractions in both mass and light for OSP, ISP and YSP. During the
fits, both Pegase.HR/Elodie3.1 and Vazdekis/Miles are used as two independent
population models. The two models result in generally consistent conclusions as
follows: for all the sample galaxies, YSPs (< 1Gyr) make important
contributions to the light. However, the dominant contributors to mass are
OSPs. We also reconstruct the smoothing star formation histories (SFHs) by
giving star formation rate (SFR) versus evolutionary age. In addition, we fit
the E+A sample and 34 randomly selected elliptical galaxies with 2-population
(2 SSPs) model. We obtain the equivalent age of old components for each of the
E+A sample and elliptical galaxies. By comparison, the old components of E+As
are statistically much younger than those of ellipticals. From the standpoint
of the stellar population age, this probably provides an evidence for the
proposed evolutionary link from E+As to early-types (E/S0s).

interacting groups of globally coupled noisy identical phase oscillators
exhibiting macroscopic rhythms. Using the phase reduction method, we derive
coupled collective phase equations describing the macroscopic rhythms of the
groups from microscopic Langevin phase equations of the individual oscillators
via nonlinear Fokker-Planck equations. For sinusoidal microscopic coupling, we
determine the type of the collective phase coupling function, i.e., whether the
groups exhibit in-phase or anti-phase synchronization. We show that the
macroscopic rhythms can exhibit effective anti-phase synchronization even if
the microscopic phase coupling between the groups is in-phase, and vice versa.
Moreover, near the onset of collective oscillations, we analytically obtain the
collective phase coupling function using center-manifold and phase reductions
of the nonlinear Fokker-Planck equations.

networks operating over a shared medium where availability is imperative.
Jamming attacks are often simple and cheap to implement. In particular, today's
jammers can perform physical carrier sensing in order to disrupt communication
more efficiently, specially in a network of simple wireless devices such as
sensor nodes, which usually operate over a single frequency (or a limited
frequency band) and which cannot benefit from the use of spread spectrum or
other more advanced technologies. This article proposes the medium access (MAC)
protocol \textsc{AntiJam} that is provably robust against a powerful reactive
adversary who can jam a $(1-\epsilon)$-portion of the time steps, where
$\epsilon$ is an arbitrary constant. The adversary uses carrier sensing to make
informed decisions on when it is most harmful to disrupt communications;
moreover, we allow the adversary to be adaptive and to have complete knowledge

of the non-jammed time periods and achieves an asymptotically optimal,
$\Theta{(1)}$-competitive throughput in this harsh scenario. In addition,
\textsc{AntiJam} features a low convergence time and has good fairness

temperature of ~0.5-0.7 keV previously known. This alters the estimate of the
ionization timescale net from ~10^{10-11} cm^-3s to >~10^{12} cm^{-3}s. Under
the assumption that N23 is still in the Sedov phase, its age evaluated from the

that N23 has already moved into the radiative phase. The abundances of the
heavy elements are found to be roughly consistent with those of the LMC
average, which indicates that the origin of the X-ray emission of N23 is
swept-up ambient material, as expected from its ionization timescale.

parallel plates made of real materials, in an arbitrary magnetodielectric
background. The plane waves satisfying the Proca equations are classified into
transverse modes and longitudinal modes which have different dispersion
relations. Transverse modes are further divided into type I and type II
corresponding to TE and TM modes in the massless case. For general
magnetodielectric media, we argue that the correct boundary conditions are the
continuities of $\mathbf{H}_{\parallel}, \phi, \mathbf{A}$ and $\pa_xA_x$,
where $x$ is the direction normal to the plates. Whereas there are type I
transverse modes that satisfy all the boundary conditions, it is impossible to
find type II transverse modes or longitudinal modes that satisfy all the
boundary conditions. To circumvent this problem, type II transverse modes and
longitudinal modes have to be considered together. We call the contribution to
the Casimir energy from type I transverse modes as TE contribution, and the
contribution from the superposition of type II transverse modes and
longitudinal modes as TM contribution. Their massless limits give respectively
the TE and TM contributions to the Casimir energy of a massless vector field.
The limit where the plates become perfectly conducting is discussed in detail.
For the special case where the background has unity refractive index, it is
shown that the TM contribution to the Casimir energy can be written as a sum of
contributions from two different types of modes, corresponding to type 2
discrete modes and type 3 continuum modes discussed by Barton and Dombey
\cite{1}. For general background, this splitting does not work. The limit where
both plates become infinitely permeable and the limit where one plate becomes

long time. If the functions are differentiable, then the mean value theorem and
Taylor's theorem come handy for this purpose. While the former is useful in
estimating $\|f(A+X)-f(A)\|$ in terms of $\|X\|$ and requires the norms of the
first derivative of the function, the latter is useful in computing higher
order perturbation bounds and needs norms of the higher order derivatives of
the function.
  In the study of matrices, determinant is an important function. Other scalar
valued functions like eigenvalues and coefficients of characteristic polynomial
are also well studied. Another interesting function of this category is the
permanent, which is an analogue of the determinant in matrix theory. More
generally, there are operator valued functions like tensor powers,
antisymmetric tensor powers and symmetric tensor powers which have gained
importance in the past. In this article, we give a survey of the recent work on
the higher order derivatives of these functions and their norms. Using Taylor's
theorem, higher order perturbation bounds are obtained. Some of these results
are very recent and their detailed proofs will appear elsewhere.

perplexing, but is necessary to ensure total conservation of momentum. Simple
situations in which such field momentum is transferred to nearby bodies and
point charges have often been considered for pedagogical purposes, normally
assuming vacuum surroundings. If dielectric media are involved, however, the
analysis becomes more delicate, not least since one encounters the
electromagnetic energy-momentum problem in matter, the `Abraham-Minkowski
enigma', of what the momentum is of a photon in matter. We analyze the momentum
balance in three nontrivial examples obeying azimuthal symmetry, showing how
the momentum conservation is satisfied as the magnetic field decays and
momentum is transferred to bodies present. In the last of the examples, that of
point charge outside a dielectric sphere in an infinite magnetic field, we find
that not all of the field momentum is transferred to the nearby bodies; a part
of the momentum appears to vanish as momentum flux towards infinity. We discuss
this and other surprising observations which can be attributed to the
assumption of magnetic fields of infinite extent. We emphasize how formal
arguments of conserved quantities cannot determine which energy-momentum tensor
is more ""correct"", and each of our conservation checks may be performed equally
well in the Minkowski or Abraham framework.

the charge relaxation for nu>1/2 is universally quantized at R_q=h/(2e^2),

emission lines. Using time series of unpolarized and circularly polarized
spectra, we reconstruct at two epochs maps of the magnetic field, surface
brightness and accretion-powered emission of AATau. We find that AATau hosts a
2-3kG magnetic dipole tilted at ~20deg to the rotation axis, and of presumably
dynamo origin. We also show that the magnetic poles of AATau host large cool
spots at photospheric level and accretion regions at chromospheric level.
  The logarithmic accretion rate at the surface of AATau at the time of our
observations is strongly variable, ranging from -9.6 to -8.5 and equal to -9.2
in average (in Msun/yr); this is an order of magnitude smaller than the disc
accretion rate at which the magnetic truncation radius (below which the disc is
disrupted by the stellar magnetic field) matches the corotation radius (where
the Keplerian period equals the stellar rotation period) - a necessary
condition for accretion to occur. It suggests that AATau is largely in the
propeller regime, with most of the accreting material in the inner disc regions
being expelled outwards and only a small fraction accreted towards the surface
of the star. The strong variability in the observed surface mass-accretion rate
and the systematic time-lag of optical occultations (by the warped accretion
disc) with respect to magnetic and accretion-powered emission maxima also
support this conclusion.
  Our results imply that AATau is being actively spun-down by the star-disc
magnetic coupling and appears as an ideal laboratory for studying angular
momentum losses of forming Suns in the propeller regime.

belong to 210,872 different stars. The numbers will grow as the RAVE survey
progresses. The public version of the catalog will be made available through

  The distances are determined with a method based on the work by Breddels et

and that its spectrum shows no peculiarities. The refinements include: the use
of either of the three isochrone sets, a better account of the stellar ages and
masses, use of more realistic errors of stellar parameter values, and
application to a larger dataset. The derived distances of both dwarfs and
giants match within ~21% to the astrometric distances of Hipparcos stars and to
the distances of observed members of open and globular clusters. Multiple
observations of a fraction of RAVE stars show that repeatability of the derived
distances is even better, with half of the objects showing a distance scatter
of \simlt 11%.
  RAVE dwarfs are ~300 pc from the Sun, and giants are at distances of 1 to 2
kpc, and up to 10 kpc. This places the RAVE dataset between the more local
Geneva-Copenhagen survey and the more distant and fainter SDSS sample. As such
it is ideal to address some of the fundamental questions of Galactic structure
and evolution in the pre-Gaia era. Individual applications are left to separate
papers, here we show that the full 6-dimensional information on position and
velocity is accurate enough to discuss the vertical structure and kinematic
properties of the thin and thick disks.

energy, and to reduce wear. Satisfying these requirements depends on the
integrity of the rubbing surface and its suitability to sliding conditions. As
such, designers currently focus on constructing surfaces that are an integral
part of the function of the tribo-system. Inspirations for such constructs come
from studying natural systems and from implementing natural design rules. One
species that may serve as an analogue for design is the Ball python. This is
because such a creature while depending on legless locomotion when sliding
against various surfaces, many of which are deemed tribologically hostile,
doesn't sustain much damage. Resistance to damage in this case originates from
surface design features. As such, studying these features and how do they
contribute to the control of friction and wear is very attractive for design
purposes. In this work we apply a multi scale surface characterization approach
to study surface design features of the Python regius that are beneficial to
design high quality lubricating surfaces (such as those obtained through
plateau honing). To this end, we studied topographical features by SEM and
through White Light Interferrometery (WLI). We further probe the roughness of
the surface on multi scale and as a function of location within the body. The
results are used to draw a comparison to metrological features of commercial
cylinder liners obtained by plateau honing.

they have been observed up to very high redshift. By means of measures of
chemical abundances now available for the galaxies hosting such events,thought
to originate from the explosion of very powerful supernovae (Type Ib/c), we
have the opportunity to study the nature of these host galaxies. The aim of
this paper is to identify the hosts of Long GRBs (LGRBs) observed both at low
and high redshift to see whether the hosts can be galaxies of the same type
observed at different cosmic epochs. We adopt detailed chemical evolution
models for galaxies of different morphological type (ellipticals, spirals,
irregulars) which follow the time evolution of the abundances of several
chemical elements (H, He, $\alpha$-elements, Fe), and compare the results with
the observed abundances and abundance ratios in galaxies hosting LGRBs. We find
that the abundances and abundance ratios predicted by models devised for
typical irregular galaxies can well fit the abundances in the hosts both at
high and low redshift. We also find that the predicted Type Ib/c supernova rate
for irregulars is in good agreement with observations. Models for spirals and
particularly ellipticals do not fit the high-redshift hosts of LGRBs (DLA
systems) nor the low redshift hosts: in particular, ellipticals cannot possibly
be the hosts of gamma-ray-bursts at low redshift since they do not show any
star formation, and therefore no supernovae Ib/c. We conclude that the observed
abundance and abundance ratios in LGRBs hosts suggest that these hosts are
irregular galaxies both at high and low redshift thus showing that the host
galaxies belong to in an evolutionary sequence.

$C_0^{\infty}(r_+,\infty)^2$ of the reduced (radial) Hamiltonian is implemented
only if a suitable relation between the mass $\mu$ of the Dirac field and the
cosmological radius $l$ holds true. The very presence of a boundary-like
behaviour of $r=\infty$ is at the root of this problem. Also, we determine in a
complete way qualitative spectral properties for the non-extremal case, for
which we can infer the absence of quantum bound states for the Dirac field.
Next, we investigate the possibility of a quantum loss of angular momentum for
the $(1 + 2)$-dimensional uncharged BTZ black hole. Unlike the corresponding
stationary four-dimensional solutions, the formal treatment of the level
crossing mechanism is much simpler. We find that, even in the extremal case, no
level crossing takes place. Therefore, no quantum loss of angular momentum via

on the activity. Our findings challenge the priority-queue model that can not
reproduce the memory effects or the activity-dependent distributions. We think
there is another kind of human activity patterns driven by personal interests
and characterized by strong memory effects. Accordingly, we propose a simple
model based on temporal preference, which can well reproduce both the
heavy-tailed nature and the strong memory effects. This work helps in
understanding both the temporal regularities and the predictability of human
behaviors.

type of phenomena we consider the problem of how birds arrive at a decision
resulting in their synchronized landing. We introduce a simple model to
interpret this process. Collective motion prior to landing is modelled using a
simple self-propelled particle (SPP) system with a new kind of boundary
condition, while the tendency and the sudden propagation of the intention of
landing is introduced through rules analogous to the random field Ising model
in an external field. We show that our approach is capable of capturing the
most relevant features of collective decision making in a system of units with
a variance of individual intentions and being under an increasing level of
pressure to switch states. We find that as a function of the few parameters of
our model the collective switching from the flying to the landing state is
indeed much sharper than the distribution of the individual landing intentions.
The transition is accompanied by a number of interesting features discussed in
this report.

should go beyond the semiclassical approximation. In this case, the physical
quantities would undergo higher-order quantum corrections, whose effect on

essential part in the process of carbon fixation through photosynthesis thus
facilitating life on earth. Despite the significant effect that Rubisco has on
the fitness of plants and other photosynthetic organisms, this enzyme is known
to have a remarkably low catalytic rate and a tendency to confuse its
substrate, carbon dioxide, with oxygen. This apparent inefficiency is puzzling
and raises questions regarding the roles of evolution versus biochemical
constraints in shaping Rubisco. Here we examine these questions by analyzing
the measured kinetic parameters of Rubisco from various organisms in various
environments. The analysis presented here suggests that the evolution of
Rubisco is confined to an effectively one-dimensional landscape, which is
manifested in simple power law correlations between its kinetic parameters.
Within this one dimensional landscape, which may represent biochemical and
structural constraints, Rubisco appears to be tuned to the intracellular
environment in which it resides such that the net photosynthesis rate is nearly
optimal. Our analysis indicates that the specificity of Rubisco is not the main
determinant of its efficiency but rather the tradeoff between the carboxylation
velocity and CO2 affinity. As a result, the presence of oxygen has only
moderate effect on the optimal performance of Rubisco, which is determined
mostly by the local CO2 concentration. Rubisco appears as an experimentally
testable example for the evolution of proteins subject both to strong selection
pressure and to biochemical constraints which strongly confine the evolutionary
plasticity to a low dimensional landscape.

young stars. As nuclear-fusion products are ejected by massive stars and
supernovae into the surrounding interstellar medium, the search for
characteristic gamma-rays from radioactivity is one way to probe the history of
activity of such nearby massive stars on a My time scale through their
nucleosynthesis. 26Al decays within ~1 My, 1809 keV gamma-rays from its decay
can be measured with current gamma-ray telescopes, such as INTEGRAL's gamma-ray
spectrometer SPI. Following earlier 26Al gamma-ray mapping with NASA's Compton
observatory, we test spatial emission skymaps of 26Al for a component which
could be attributed to ejecta from massive stars in the Scorpius-Centaurus
group of stars. Such a model fit of spatial distributions for large-scale and
local components is able to discriminate 26Al emission associated with
Scorpius-Centaurus, in spite of the strong underlying nucleosynthesis signal
from the Galaxy at large. We find an 26Al signal above 5 sigma significance,
which we associate with the Sco-Cen group. The observed flux of 6 *10^{-5}ph
cm^{-2} s^{-1} corresponds to 1.1 *10^{-4} M_sol of 26Al. This traces the
nucleosynthesis ejecta of several massive stars within the past several million
years. We confirm through direct detection of radioactive 26Al the recent
ejection of massive-star nucleosynthesis products from the Sco-Cen association.
Its youngest subgroup in Upper Scorpius appears to dominate 26Al contributions
from this association. Our 26Al signal can be interpreted as a measure of the
age and richness of this youngest subgroup. We also estimate a kinematic
imprint of these nearby massive-star ejecta from the bulk motion of 26Al and
compare this to other indications of Scorpius-Centaurus massive-star activity .

biological systems, takes place in a crowded noisy biochemical environment and

transmission of information via a noisy channel and use this analogy to gain
insights on the optimal, or fittest, molecular recognizer. We focus on the
optimal structural properties of the molecules such as flexibility and
conformation. We show that conformational changes upon binding, which often
occur during molecular recognition, may optimize the detection performance of
the recognizer. We thus suggest a generic design principle termed
'conformational proofreading' in which deformation enhances detection. We
evaluate the optimal flexibility of the molecular recognizer, which is
analogous to the stochasticity in a decision unit. In some scenarios, a
flexible recognizer, i.e., a stochastic decision unit, performs better than a
rigid, deterministic one. As a biological example, we discuss conformational
changes during homologous recombination, the process of genetic exchange
between two DNA strands.

the polymer lies(essentially) either above or below the repulsive line. As a
consequence one expects a metastable behavior with rare jumps between the two
phases combined with a fast thermalization inside each phase. However the
energy barrier between these two phases is only logarithmic in the system size
L and therefore the two relevant time scales are only polynomial in L with no
clear-cut separation between them. The whole evolution is governed by a subtle
competition between the diffusive behavior inside one phase and the jumps
across the energy barriers. In particular the usual scenario in which the
tunneling time coincides with the exponential of the energy barrier breaks
down. Our main results are: (i) a proof that the mixing time of the system lies
between L^{5/2} and L^{5/2+2}; (ii) the identification of two regions

is found through a tight-binding model (TB) that for certain periodicities,
called here NGPs (non-gap periodicities), no gap is opened at the Dirac point.
This result is confirmed by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. DFT
results show that a tiny gap is opened for NGPs due to exchange effects, not
taken into account in the TB model. However, this tiny gap is one or two orders
of magnitude smaller than the gap opened for other periodicities different from
NGPs. This finding opens up a new path for band gap engineering experiments in
graphene.

mismatch is large and the droplet surface tension is small, a growing droplet
can be unstable to a family of shape instabilities. We observe this phenomenon
for Yb deposited and annealed on few layer graphenes and develop a theoretical
model to describe it by studying the renormalization of the line tension of a
two dimensional droplet by repulsive interparticle interactions. Our model
describes the onset of shape instabilities for nanoparticles where the growth

we show in this article that the module structure and the orthogonality

structure. In fact, we have a more general result as follows. Let $A$ be a
$C^*$-algebra, $E$ and $F$ be Hilbert $A$-modules, and $I_E$ be the ideal of
$A$ generated by $\{\langle x,y\rangle_A: x,y\in E\}$. If $\Phi : E\to F$ is an
$A$-module map, not assumed to be bounded but satisfying $$ \langle
\Phi(x),\Phi(y)\rangle_A\ =\ 0\quad\text{whenever}\quad\langle x,y\rangle_A\ =\
0, $$ then there exists a unique central positive multiplier $u\in M(I_E)$ such
that $$ \langle \Phi(x), \Phi(y)\rangle_A\ =\ u \langle x, y\rangle_A\qquad
(x,y\in E). $$ As a consequence, $\Phi$ is automatically bounded, the induced
map $\Phi_0: E\to \overline{\Phi(E)}$ is adjointable, and $\overline{Eu^{1/2}}$
is isomorphic to $\overline{\Phi(E)}$ as Hilbert $A$-modules. If, in addition,
$\Phi$ is bijective, then $E$ is isomorphic to $F$.

expression of genes. They contain DNA binding domains which belong to several
super-families, each with a specific mechanism of DNA binding. The total number
of transcription factors encoded in a genome increases with the number of genes
in the genome. Here, we examined the number of transcription factors from each
super-family in diverse organisms.
  We find that the number of transcription factors from most super-families
appears to be bounded. For example, the number of winged helix factors does not
generally exceed 300, even in very large genomes. The magnitude of the maximal
number of transcription factors from each super-family seems to correlate with
the number of DNA bases effectively recognized by the binding mechanism of that
super-family. Coding theory predicts that such upper bounds on the number of
transcription factors should exist, in order to minimize cross-binding errors
between transcription factors. This theory further predicts that factors with
similar binding sequences should tend to have similar biological effect, so
that errors based on mis-recognition are minimal. We present evidence that
transcription factors with similar binding sequences tend to regulate genes
with similar biological functions, supporting this prediction.
  The present study suggests limits on the transcription factor repertoire of
cells, and suggests coding constraints that might apply more generally to the
mapping between binding sites and biological function.

ill-posed problems is strongly associated to the optimal order of convergence
of the regularization error. In this article, the definition of qualification
is extended and three different levels are introduced: weak, strong and
optimal. It is shown that the weak qualification extends the definition
introduced by Mathe and Pereverzev in 2003, mainly in the sense that the
functions associated to orders of convergence and source sets need not be the
same. It is shown that certain methods possessing infinite classical
qualification, e.g. truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD), Landweber's
method and Showalter's method, also have generalized qualification leading to
an optimal order of convergence of the regularization error. Sufficient
conditions for a SRM to have weak qualification are provided and necessary and
sufficient conditions for a given order of convergence to be strong or optimal
qualification are found. Examples of all three qualification levels are
provided and the relationships between them as well as with the classical
concept of qualification and the qualification introduced by Mathe and
Perevezev are shown. In particular, spectral regularization methods having
extended qualification in each one of the three levels and having zero or
infinite classical qualification are presented. Finally several implications of
this theory in the context of orders of convergence, converse results and
maximal source sets for inverse ill-posed problems, are shown.
