the lower corona. They do not calculate accurately the transfer of free
magnetic energy from the convection zone to the magnetically dominated corona
because they model the effects of flux emergence using kinematic boundary
conditions or simply assume the appearance of flux at these heights. We test
the importance of including dynamical flux emergence in CME modeling by
simulating, in 2.5D, the emergence of sub-surface flux tubes into different
coronal magnetic field configurations. We investigate how much free magnetic
energy, in the form of shear magnetic field, is transported from the convection
zone to the corona, and whether dynamical flux emergence can drive CMEs. We
find that multiple coronal flux ropes can be formed during flux emergence, and
although they carry some shear field into the corona, the majority of shear
field is confined to the lower atmosphere. Less than 10% of the magnetic energy
in the corona is in the shear field, and this, combined with the fact that the
coronal flux ropes bring up significant dense material, means that they do not
erupt. Our results have significant implications for all CME models which rely
on the transfer of free magnetic energy from the lower atmosphere into the
corona but which do not explicitly model this transfer. Such studies of flux
emergence and CMEs are timely, as we have new capabilities to observe this with
Hinode and SDO, and therefore to test the models against observations.

which classifies operations as effect constructors or effect deconstructors; it
also provides a link with functional programming, being a refinement of Moggi's
seminal monadic point of view. There is a natural algebraic theory of the
constructors whose free algebra functor is Moggi's monad; we illustrate this by
characterising free and initial algebras in terms of two versions of the stable
failures model of CSP, one more general than the other. Deconstructors are
dealt with as homomorphisms to (possibly non-free) algebras.
  One can view CSP's action and choice operators as constructors and the rest,
such as concealment and concurrency, as deconstructors. Carrying this programme
out results in taking deterministic external choice as constructor rather than
general external choice. However, binary deconstructors, such as the CSP
concurrency operator, provide unresolved difficulties. We conclude by
presenting a combination of CSP with Moggi's computational {\lambda}-calculus,
in which the operators, including concurrency, are polymorphic. While the paper
mainly concerns CSP, it ought to be possible to carry over similar ideas to
other process calculi.

molecular gas, made with the Australia Telescope National Facility Mopra

Moreover, because the molecular line emission from the entire nebula has the

cloud and not the chance alignment of multiple unrelated clouds along the line
of sight.
  The Nessie Nebula contains a number of compact, dense molecular cores which
have a characteristic projected spacing of ~ 4.5 pc along the filament. The
theory of gravitationally bound gaseous cylinders predicts the existence of
such cores, which, due to the ""sausage"" or ""varicose"" fluid instability,
fragment from the cylinder at a characteristic length scale. If turbulent
pressure dominates over thermal pressure in Nessie, then the observed core
spacing matches theoretical predictions. We speculate that the formation of
high-mass stars and massive star clusters arises from the fragmentation of
filamentary IRDCs caused by the ""sausage"" fluid instability that leads to the
formation of massive, dense molecular cores. The filamentary molecular gas
clouds often found near high-mass star-forming regions (e.g., Orion, NGC 6334,

subjected to centrifugal compression, for arbitrary constitutive relation

required by packings composed of deformable but incompressible particles.
Experimental data are presented for the centrifugal compression of
thermo-responsive N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPA) microgel beads in water. For
small radial acceleration, the results are consistent with Hertzian elasticity,
and are analyzed in terms of the Young elastic modulus of the bead material.
For large radial acceleration, the sample compression asymptotes to a value
corresponding to a space-filling particle volume fraction of unity. Therefore
we conclude that the gel beads are incompressible, and deform without
deswelling. In addition, we find that the Young elastic modulus of the

applications in number theory. Gauss, over two centuries ago, studied quadratic
rings and ideals associated to binary quadratic forms, and found that ideal
classes of quadratic rings are exactly parametrized by equivalence classes of
integral binary quadratic forms. Delone and Faddeev, in 1940, showed that cubic
rings are parametrized by equivalence classes of integral binary cubic forms.
Birch, Merriman, Nakagawa, Corso, Dvornicich, and Simon have all studied rings
associated to binary forms of degree n for any n, but it has not previously
been known which rings, and with what additional structure, are associated to
binary forms. In this paper, we show exactly what algebraic structures are
parametrized by binary n-ic forms, for all n. The algebraic data associated to
an integral binary n-ic form includes a ring isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}^n$ as a
$\mathbb{Z}$-module, an ideal class for that ring, and a condition on the ring
and ideal class that comes naturally from geometry. In fact, we prove these
parametrizations when any base scheme replaces the integers, and show that the
correspondences between forms and the algebraic data are functorial in the base
scheme. We give geometric constructions of the rings and ideals from the forms
that parametrize them and a simple construction of the form from an appropriate
ring and ideal.

Consequently, an important aspect of the mechanical behavior of membranes,

a simple relay selection scheme can achieve maximal diversity. Then, using the
localization method, we construct both fixed-length and variable-length local

regression based on Mahalanobis-decorrelation of the explanatory variables. The
CAR score provides a canonical ordering that encourages grouping of correlated
predictors and down-weights antagonistic variables. It decomposes the
proportion of variance explained and it is an intermediate between marginal
correlation and the standardized regression coefficient. As a population
quantity, any preferred inference scheme can be applied for its estimation.
Using simulations we demonstrate that variable selection by CAR scores is very
effective and yields prediction errors and true and false positive rates that
compare favorably with modern regression techniques such as elastic net and
boosting. We illustrate our approach by analyzing data concerned with diabetes
progression and with the effect of aging on gene expression in the human brain.

cosmological reionization. Unfortunately, due to the prohibitively large
dynamic range required, it is impossible to self-consistently include these
systems in cosmological simulations. Using fast and versatile semi-numeric
simulations, we systematically explore the spatial distribution of absorption
systems during and following reionization. We self-calibrate the resulting
number of absorbers to the mean free path (mfp) of the ionizing ultraviolet
background (UVB), and present results at a given mfp and neutral hydrogen
fraction. We use a simple optical depth criterion to identify the locations of
absorbers. Our approach is fairly robust to uncertainties such as missing
subgrid structure. Unlike at lower redshifts where the UVB is relatively
uniform, at higher redshifts the fluctuations in the UVB and the HII morphology
of reionization can drive the large-scale distribution of absorption systems.
Specifically, we find that absorbers are highly correlated with the density
field on small scales, and then become anti-correlated with the UVB on large
scales. After reionization, the large-scale power spectrum of the absorbers
traces the UVB power spectrum, which can be predicted with a simple analytic
extension of the halo-model. During reionization, absorbers tend to
preferentially lie inside overdensities (i.e. filaments) of the
recently-ionized intergalactic medium (IGM). Absorbers may also dominate the
small-scale (k > 1/Mpc) 21-cm power during and after reionization. Conversely,
they smooth the contrast on moderate scales. Once the HII regions grow to
surpass the mfp, the absorbers add to the large-scale 21-cm power. Our results
should prove useful in interpreting future observations of the reionization
epoch.

found M_BH = (1.5^{+1.1}_{-0.6}) x 10^9 M_sun, while Maciejewski & Binney

we have performed new measurements of the gas kinematics in M84 from the same
archival data, and carried out comprehensive gas-dynamical modeling for the
emission-line disk within ~70 pc from the nucleus. In comparison with the two
previous studies of M84, our analysis includes a more complete treatment of the
propagation of emission-line profiles through the telescope and STIS optics, as
well as inclusion of the effects of an intrinsic velocity dispersion in the
emission-line disk. We find that an intrinsic velocity dispersion is needed in
order to match the observed line widths, and we calculate gas-dynamical models
both with and without a correction for asymmetric drift. Including the effect
of asymmetric drift improves the model fit to the observed velocity field. Our
best-fitting model with asymmetric drift gives M_BH = (8.5^{+0.9}_{-0.8}) x
10^8 M_sun (68% confidence). This is a factor of ~2 smaller than the mass often
adopted in studies of the M_BH - sigma and M_BH - L relationships. Our result

characterized by unusually low 6 -- 9/11.3 microns inter-band ratios. After the

microns spectral region requires dust features not normally present in star
forming galaxies. Each spectrum is then analyzed with the aim of identifying
their components and origin. In contrast to normal star forming galaxies, where
cationic PAH emission prevails, our 6--14 microns spectra seem to be dominated
by large and neutral PAH emission, responsible for the low 6 -- 9/11.3 microns
ratios, plus two broad dust emission features peaking at 8.2 microns and 12
microns. Theses broad components, observed until now mainly in evolved carbon
stars and usually attributed to pristine material, contribute approximately
30-50% of the total PAH flux in the 6--14 microns region. We propose that the
PAH molecules in our ETGs arise from fresh carbonaceous material which is
continuously released by a population of carbon stars, formed in a rejuvenation
episode which occurred within the last few Gyr. The analysis of the MIR spectra
allows us to infer that, in order to maintain the peculiar size and charge
distributions biased to large and neutral PAHs, this material must be shocked,

Finally, we conclude with the known solutions and techniques, describe
connections with efficient algorithms as well as miscellaneous variants of HSP.
  We also bring various contributions to the topic. We show that in theory, we
can solve HSP over a given group inductively: the base case is solving HSP over
its simple factor groups and the inductive step is building efficient oracles
over a normal subgroup N and over the factor group G/N. We apply this analysis
to the Dedekindian HSP to get an alternative abelian HSP algorithm based on a
change of the underlying group. We also propose a quotient reduction by the
normal group obtained via Weak Fourier Sampling. We compute the exact
expression of Strong Fourier Sampling over the dihedral group, showing how the
previous reduction is natural and matches the standard one. We also give a
reduction of rigid graph isomorphism problem to HSP over the alternating group.
For this group and other simple groups, we propose maximal subgroup reduction
as a possible approach. We also analyse Regev's algorithm for the

Hercules is a stellar stream and that its stars are flowing along the orbit of
its progenitor, we find an orbit that would have recently brought the system
close enough to the Milky Way to induce its disruption and transformation from
a bound dwarf galaxy into a stellar stream. The application of simple
analytical techniques to the tentative radial velocity gradient observed in the
satellite provides tight constraints on the tangential velocity of the system
(v_t = -16^{+6}_{-22} km/s in the Galactic Standard of Rest). Combined with its
large receding velocity, the determined tangential velocity yields an orbit
with a small pericentric distance (R_peri = 6^{+9}_{-2} kpc). Tidal disruption
is therefore a valid scenario for explaining the extreme shape of Hercules. The
increase in the mean flattening of dwarf galaxies as one considers fainter
systems could therefore be the impact of a few of these satellites not being

formation, shedding their stars in the Milky Way's stellar halo.

waves (the fundamental solution of the viscous Burgers equation) in asymptotic

is based on the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) principle with additional constraints
included. Next, we show equivalence of our method when applied to the
Gutzwiller approximation (GA), with the mean-field slave-boson (SB) formalism
(on the example of the single-band Hubbard model). This equivalence provides
thus an alternative justification of the results obtained within the SB
approach which, however, contains ad hoc assumptions to position it in
agreement with GA. Our approach implies that all predictions of the MF SB
method can be obtained in a simpler, transparent, and controllable manner
within GA when supplemented with the statistical-consistency conditions. We
call the method as the Statistically-consistent Gutzwiller Approximation (SGA).
Explicitly, the present formulation does not require introducing the condensed
amplitudes of auxiliary Bose fields, which do not have a direct physical
meaning and do not appear in the present formulation. Although the results of
SGA are in the present case equivalent to SB, one can improve them further by
utilizing more advanced schemes of calculating averages beyond the standard GA.
To illustrate our approach, as well as to outline its advantages over
alternative treatments of GA, we select the case of almost localized Fermi
liquid (ALFL) in two dimensions and analyze it in detail within the
tight-binding approximation. We also comment on significance of our method for
describing correlated fermions. Namely, the reasoning used here can be applied
to the corresponding MF treatment of the multiband Hubbard, the periodic
Anderson, the $t-J$, and the $t-J-U$ models. In this manner our method may be
applied for strongly correlated electron systems, optical lattices, and other
related situations.

dynamic range. Specifically, a largest eigenvalue equal to one corresponds to a
critical regime with maximum dynamic range. We gain deeper insight on the
effects of network topology using a nonlinear analysis in terms of additional
spectral properties of the adjacency matrix. We find that homogeneous networks

bloggers begin to write blogs with great interest, and then their interests
gradually achieve a balance with the passage of time. In order to describe the
phenomenon that people's interest in something gradually decreases until it
reaches a balance, we first propose the model that describes the attenuation of
interest and reflects the fact that people's interest becomes more stable after
a long time. We give a rigorous analysis on this model by non-homogeneous
Poisson processes. Our analysis indicates that the interval distribution of
arrival-time is a mixed distribution with exponential and power-law feature,
that is, it is a power law with an exponential cutoff. Second, we collect blogs
in ScienceNet.cn and carry on empirical studies on the interarrival time
distribution. The empirical results agree well with the analytical result,
obeying a special power law with the exponential cutoff, that is, a special
kind of Gamma distribution. These empirical results verify the model, providing
an evidence for a new class of phenomena in human dynamics. In human dynamics
there are other distributions, besides power-law distributions. These findings
demonstrate the variety of human behavior dynamics.

manner, with low computational complexity. However, these codes are classically
implemented over finite fields whose size depends on some global network
parameters (size of the network, the number of sinks) that may not be known
prior to code design. Also, if new nodes join the entire network code may have
to be redesigned.
  In this work, we present the first universal and robust distributed linear
network coding schemes. Our schemes are universal since they are independent of
all network parameters. They are robust since if nodes join or leave, the
remaining nodes do not need to change their coding operations and the receivers
can still decode. They are distributed since nodes need only have topological
information about the part of the network upstream of them, which can be
naturally streamed as part of the communication protocol.
  We present both probabilistic and deterministic schemes that are all
asymptotically rate-optimal in the coding block-length, and have guarantees of
correctness. Our probabilistic designs are computationally efficient, with
order-optimal complexity. Our deterministic designs guarantee zero error
decoding, albeit via codes with high computational complexity in general. Our
coding schemes are based on network codes over ``scalable fields"". Instead of
choosing coding coefficients from one field at every node, each node uses
linear coding operations over an ``effective field-size"" that depends on the
node's distance from the source node. The analysis of our schemes requires
technical tools that may be of independent interest. In particular, we
generalize the Schwartz-Zippel lemma by proving a non-uniform version, wherein
variables are chosen from sets of possibly different sizes. We also provide a
novel robust distributed algorithm to assign unique IDs to network nodes.

transmitter side to multiplex users in the spatial domain. Since perfect
channel knowledge is difficult to obtain in practice, \emph{limited feedback}
is a widely accepted solution. The {\em dynamic number of cooperating BSs} and
{\em heterogeneous path loss effects} of network MIMO systems pose new
challenges on limited feedback design. In this paper, we propose a scalable
limited feedback design for network MIMO systems with multiple base stations,
multiple users and multiple data streams for each user. We propose a {\em
limited feedback framework using per-cell product codebooks}, along with a {\em
low-complexity feedback indices selection algorithm}. We show that the proposed
per-cell product codebook limited feedback design can asymptotically achieve
the same performance as the joint-cell codebook approach. We also derive an
asymptotic \emph{per-user throughput loss} due to limited feedback with
per-cell product codebooks. Based on that, we show that when the number of
per-user feedback-bits $B_{k}$ is $\mathcal{O}\big( Nn_{T}n_{R}\log_{2}(\rho
g_{k}^{sum})\big)$, the system operates in the \emph{noise-limited} regime in
which the per-user throughput is $\mathcal{O} \left( n_{R} \log_{2} \big(
\frac{n_{R}\rho g_{k}^{sum}}{Nn_{T}} \big) \right)$. On the other hand, when
the number of per-user feedback-bits $B_{k}$ does not scale with the
\emph{system SNR} $\rho$, the system operates in the
\emph{interference-limited} regime where the per-user throughput is
$\mathcal{O}\left( \frac{n_{R}B_{k}}{(Nn_{T})^{2}} \right)$. Numerical results
show that the proposed design is very flexible to accommodate dynamic number of
cooperating BSs and achieves much better performance compared with other
baselines (such as the Givens rotation approach).

containing the second derivatives of the scalar field but not leading to
additional degrees of freedom. These models exhibit peculiar features, such as
an essential mixing of scalar and tensor kinetic terms, which we have named
kinetic braiding. This braiding causes the scalar stress tensor to deviate from
the perfect-fluid form. Cosmology in these models possesses a rich
phenomenology, even in the limit where the scalar is an exact Goldstone boson.
Generically, there are attractor solutions where the scalar monitors the
behaviour of external matter. Because of the kinetic braiding, the position of
the attractor depends both on the form of the Lagrangian and on the external
energy density. The late-time asymptotic of these cosmologies is a de Sitter
state. The scalar can exhibit phantom behaviour and is able to cross the
phantom divide with neither ghosts nor gradient instabilities. These features
provide a new class of models for Dark Energy. As an example, we study in
detail a simple one-parameter model. The possible observational signatures of
this model include a sizeable Early Dark Energy and a specific equation of
state evolving into the final de-Sitter state from a healthy phantom regime.

resonant character of the unstable excited states introduces a problem because
the low-energy tails of these resonances can intrude into the sub-threshold,

modifying, in an energy-dependent way, the shape of the target resonances from

to fading, environmental changes and movement of mobile wireless devices.
Tracking and estimating channel gains of wireless channels is therefore a
fundamentally important element of many wireless communication systems. In
particular, the receivers in many wireless networks need to estimate the
channel gains by means of a training sequence. This paper studies the scaling
law (on the network size) of the overhead for channel gain monitoring in
wireless network. We first investigate the scenario in which a receiver needs
to track the channel gains with respect to multiple transmitters. To be
concrete, suppose that there are n transmitters, and that in the current round
of channel-gain estimation, no more than k channels suffer significant
variations since the last round. We proves that ""\Theta(k\log((n+1)/k)) time
slots"" is the minimum number of time slots needed to catch up with the k varied
channels. At the same time, we propose a novel channel-gain monitoring scheme
named ADMOT to achieve the overhead lower-bound. ADMOT leverages recent
advances in compressive sensing in signal processing and interference
processing in wireless communication, to enable the receiver to estimate all n
channels in a reliable and computationally efficient manner within
O(k\log((n+1)/k)) time slots. To our best knowledge, all previous
channel-tracking schemes require \Theta(n) time slots regardless of k. Note
that based on above results for single receiver scenario, the scaling law of

connected at a time equivalent to full term. The spontaneous bursting activity
that characterizes cultures develops in parallel with the connectivity. The
average number of inputs per neuron can be quantitatively determined in units
of $m_0$, the number of activated inputs needed to excite the neuron. For
$m_0\sim 10$ we find that hippocampal neurons have on average $\sim 40-80$
inputs while cortical neurons have $\sim 50-100$, depending on neuronal
density. The ratio of excitatory to inhibitory neurons is determined using the
GABA$_\text{A}$ antagonist bicuculine. This ratio changes during development
and reaches the final value at day $7-8$, coinciding with the expected time of
the GABA switch. For hippocampal cultures the inhibitory cells comprise about
$30\%$ of the neurons in the culture while for cortical cultures they are about
$20\%$. Such detailed global information on the connectivity of networks in
neuronal cultures is at present inaccessible by any electrophysiological or

the given architecture. Two methods of deriving a deterministic test set at
functional level are suggested. The first method is based on the classical
genetic algorithm with binary and arithmetic crossover and mutation operators.
The second one uses genetic programming, where test is represented as a
sequence of microoperations. In the latter case, we apply two-point crossover

  Communications",,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Erasure codes provide a storage efficient alternative to replication based
redundancy in (networked) storage systems. They however entail high
communication overhead for maintenance, when some of the encoded fragments are
lost and need to be replenished. Such overheads arise from the fundamental need
to recreate (or keep separately) first a copy of the whole object before any
individual encoded fragment can be generated and replenished. There has been
recently intense interest to explore alternatives, most prominent ones being
regenerating codes (RGC) and hierarchical codes (HC). We propose as an
alternative a new family of codes to improve the maintenance process, which we
call self-repairing codes (SRC), with the following salient features: (a)
encoded fragments can be repaired directly from other subsets of encoded
fragments without having to reconstruct first the original data, ensuring that
(b) a fragment is repaired from a fixed number of encoded fragments, the number
depending only on how many encoded blocks are missing and independent of which
specific blocks are missing. These properties allow for not only low
communication overhead to recreate a missing fragment, but also independent
reconstruction of different missing fragments in parallel, possibly in
different parts of the network. We analyze the static resilience of SRCs with
respect to traditional erasure codes, and observe that SRCs incur marginally
larger storage overhead in order to achieve the aforementioned properties. The
salient SRC properties naturally translate to low communication overheads for
reconstruction of lost fragments, and allow reconstruction with lower latency
by facilitating repairs in parallel. These desirable properties make
self-repairing codes a good and practical candidate for networked distributed
storage systems.

by the specific setting of the granular flow, so that our scheme should be
easily adapted to describe crowd dynamics issues of many sorts, from stampedes
in panic scenarios to organized flow around obstacles or through bottlenecks.
We validate our scheme by computing the serving times statistics of a group of
agents crowding to be served around a desk. In the case of a size homogeneous
crowd, we recover intuitive results prompted by physical sense. However, as a
further illustration of our theoretical framework, we show that heterogeneous
systems display a less obvious behavior, as smaller agents feature shorter
serving times. Finally, we analyze our results in the light of known properties
of non-equilibrium hard-disk fluids and discuss general implications of our

are present in the Spitzer spectra. Deviations of the synthetic spectra from
the observations are most likely related to grain shape effects and
uncertainties in the iron content of the dust grains. Our analysis revealed
that larger grains are more abundant in the disk atmosphere of flatter disks
than in that of flared disks, indicating that grain growth and sedimentation
decrease the disk flaring. We did not find, however, correlations between the
value of crystallinity and any of the investigated system parameters. Our
analysis shows that enstatite is more concentrated toward the warm inner disk
than forsterite, in contrast to predictions of equilibrium condensation models.
None of the three crystal formation mechanisms proposed so far can alone
explain all our findings. It is very likely that all three play at least some
role in the formation of crystalline silicates.

compact object mass following from the geodesic relativistic precession model
for kHz QPOs. Neglecting the neutron star rotation they reported the inferred
mass M_0 = 2.2 +/- 0.3 M_\sun. We present a more detailed analysis of the
estimate which involves the frame-dragging effects associated with rotating
spacetimes. For a free mass we find acceptable fits of the model to data for
(any) small dimensionless compact object angular momentum j=cJ/GM^2. Moreover,
quality of the fit tends to increase very gently with rising j. Good fits are
reached when M ~ M_0[1+0.55(j+j^2)]. It is therefore impossible to estimate the
mass without the independent knowledge of the angular momentum and vice versa.
Considering j up to 0.3 the range of the feasible values of mass extends up to
3M_\sun. We suggest that similar increase of estimated mass due to rotational
effects can be relevant for several other sources.

The emerging result is exponentiation of a sum of webs, where each web is a
linear combination of a subset of diagrams that are mutually related by
permuting the eikonal gluon attachments to each hard parton. These linear
combinations are responsible for partial cancellation of subdivergences,
conforming with the renormalization of a multi-leg eikonal vertex. We also

expansion in the string frame (S-frame), therefore the so-called form factors
are present in the effective action. The correct Dark Energy scale is recovered
in the Einstein frame (E-frame) without unnatural fine-tunings and this result
is robust against all quantum corrections, granted that we assume a proper
structure of the S-frame form factors in the strong coupling regime. At this
stage, the possibility still exists that a certain amount of fine-tuning may be
required to satisfy some phenomenological constraints. Moreover in the E-frame,
in our proposal, all the interactions are switched off on cosmological length
scales (i.e. the theory is IR-free), while higher derivative gravitational

B-bar pairs collected at the Upsilon(4S) resonance with the BABAR detector at
the SLAC PEP-II B-Factory. We select a sample of events with one completely
reconstructed B- in an hadronic decay mode (B- --> D{(*)0}X- and B- --> J/psi
X-). We examine the rest of the event to search for a B+ --> tau+ nu_tau decay.
We identify the tau+ lepton in the following modes: tau+ --> e+ nu nu, tau+ -->
mu+ nu nu, tau+ --> pi+ nu and tau+ --> rho nu. We find an excess of events
with respect to expected background, which excludes the null signal hypothesis
at the level of 3.3 sigma and can be converted to a branching fraction central
value of B( B+ --> tau+ nu_tau )=( 1.80 +0.57 -0.54 (stat.) +-0.26 (syst.)) x
10^{-4}.
