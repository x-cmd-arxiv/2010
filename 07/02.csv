generalizations to n-linear algebras, n>2. This book has five chapters. The
first chapter is introductory in nature and gives a few essential definitions
and references for the reader to make use of the literature in case the reader
is not thorough with the basics. The second chapter deals with different types
of neutrosophic bilinear algebras and bivector spaces and proves several
results analogous to linear bialgebra. In chapter three the authors introduce
the notion of n-linear algebras and prove several theorems related to them.
Many of the classical theorems for neutrosophic algebras are proved with
appropriate modifications. Chapter four indicates the probable applications of
these algebraic structures. The final chapter suggests about 80 innovative
problems for the reader to solve.

  Improved Automatic P-Phase Arrival Detection",,,,,"physics.geo-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we present two new procedures for automatic detection and
picking of P-wave arrivals. The first involves the application of kurtosis and
skewness on the vector magnitude of three component seismograms. Customarily,
P-wave arrival detection techniques use vertical component seismogram which is
appropriate only for teleseismic events. The inherent weakness of those methods
stems from the fact that the energy from P-wave is distributed among horizontal
and vertical recording channels. Our procedure, however, uses the vector
magnitude which accommodates all components. The results show that this
procedure would be useful for detecting/picking of P-arrivals from local and
regional earthquakes and man-made explosions. The second procedure introduces a
new method called ""Ratios in Higher Order Statistics (RHOS)."" Unlike commonly
used techniques that involve derivatives, this technique employs ratios of
adjacent kurtosis and skewness values to improve the accuracy of the detection
of the P onset. RHOS can be applied independently on vertical component
seismogram as well as the vector magnitude for improved detection of P-wave
arrivals.

atmospheric parameters (Teff, log g, [M/H], Vrot sin i) of a large sample of
carefully selected RC stars, fainter than those present in other spectroscopic
surveys and located over a great circle at high Galactic latitudes. Methods: We
acquired data of the program stars of high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) and high
resolution with the Asiago Echelle spectrograph. Radial velocities were
obtained by applying cross-correlation and atmospheric parameters via chi2 fit
to a synthetic spectral library. Extensive tests were carried out by
re-observing with the same instrument a large number of standard stars taken
from a variety of sources in the literature. During these tests, we found that
the absolute Tycho VT magnitude of local red clump stars is not dependent on
metallicity. Results: A total of 277 red clump stars (101 of them with a second
epoch observation) of the extended solar neighborhood and 55 calibration stars
were observed and included in an output catalog that contains (in addition to
relevant support astrometric and photometric data taken from literature) the

results from an eikonal model in which the rise of the total cross-section is
due to mini-jet contribution. We perform the calculation with current Parton
Density Functions (PDFs). The impact parameter distribution we use is obtained
as the Fourier transform of the resummed $k_t$-distribution of soft gluons
emitted from the initial state during the collision.The emission, which is
energy dependent, destroys the initial collinearity of partons.In this model,
the strong power-like rise due to the increasing number of low-x gluon
collisions is tamed by the acollinearity induced by soft gluon kt-resummation
down to zero gluon momenta. It explicitly links a singular soft gluon coupling
in the infrared region to the behaviour dictated by the Froissart bound for the
total cross-section. The model describes well both proton and photon processes
at present accelerator energies and gives predictions in the TeV range. For
photons the model predictions agree with fits by Block and Halzen based on
Finite Energy Sum Rules (FESR) at low energy and an asymptotic behaviour
consistent with the Froissart bound.

and resultant productions of the light elements including boron and its stable
isotopes. SN Ic is a very unique boron source because it can produce boron
through not only spallation reactions as discussed in Nakamura & Shigeyama
(2004) but also the neutrino-process. The neutrino-process is considered to
occur in core-collapse supernovae and previous studies were limited to Type II
supernovae (SNe II). Although the progenitor star of an SN Ic does not posses a
He envelope so that 7Li production via the neutrino-process is unlikely, 11B
can be produced in the C-rich layers. We demonstrate a hydrodynamic simulation
of SN Ic explosion and estimate the amounts of the light elements produced via
the neutrino-process for the first time, and also the subsequent spallation
reactions between the outermost layers of compact SN Ic progenitor and the
ambient medium. We find that the neutrino-process in the current SN Ic model
produces a significant amount of 11B, which is diluted by 10B from spallation
reactions to get closer to B isotopic ratios observed in meteorites. We also
confirm that high-temperature mu- and tau-neutrinos and their anti-neutrinos,
reasonably suggested from the compact structure of SN Ic progenitors, enhance
the light element production through the neutral-current reactions, which may
imply an important role of SNe Ic in the Galactic chemical evolution.

into GUE (also for beta=1 and 4), by letting the entries evolve according to

the matrix evolve according to non-intersecting Brownian motions. The present
paper shows that the interlacing spectra of two consecutive principal minors
form a Markov process (diffusion) as well. This diffusion consists of two sets
of Dyson non-intersecting Brownian motions, with a specific interaction
respecting the interlacing. This is revealed in the form of the generator, the

was explained as emission from the inner wall of a circumstellar disk, with the
inner disk truncated at ~10 AU. Based on the SED shape and the assumption that
it was produced by a single star and its disk, CoKu Tau/4 was classified as a
prototypical transitional disk, with a clean inner hole possibly carved out by
a planet, some other orbiting body, or by photodissociation. However, recently
it has been discovered that CoKu Tau/4 is a close binary system. This implies
that the observed mid-IR SED is probably produced by the circumbinary disk. The
aim of the present paper is to model the SED of CoKu Tau/4 as arising from the
inner wall of a circumbinary disk, with parameters constrained by what is known
about the central stars and by a dynamical model for the interaction between
these stars and their surrounding disk. In order to fit the Spitzer IRS SED,
the binary orbit should be almost circular, implying a small mid-IR variability
(10%) related to the variable distances of the stars to the inner wall of the
circumbinary disk. Our models suggest that the inner wall of CoKu Tau/4 is
located at 1.7a, where a is the semi-major axis of the binary system (a~8AU). A
small amount of optically thin dust in the hole (<0.01 lunar masses) helps to
improve the fit to the 10microns silicate band. Also, we find that water ice
should be absent or have a very small abundance (a dust to gas mass ratio
<5.6X10^{-5}). In general, for a binary system with eccentricity e>0, the model
predicts mid-IR variability with periods similar to orbital timescales,
assuming that thermal equilibrium is reached instantaneously.

fluid. The fluid-solid system fills the whole two dimensional space and the
fluid is assumed to be at rest at infinity. Our aim is to study the inverse
problem, initially introduced in [3], that consists in recovering the position
and the velocity of the solid assuming that the potential function is known at
a given time. We show that this problem is in general ill-posed by providing
counterexamples for which the same potential corresponds to different positions
and velocities of a same solid. However, it is also possible to find solids
having a specific shape, like ellipses for instance, for which the problem of
detection admits a unique solution. Using complex analysis, we prove that the
well-posedness of the inverse problem is equivalent to the solvability of an
infinite set of nonlinear equations. This result allows us to show that when
the solid enjoys some symmetry properties, it can be partially detected.
Besides, for any solid, the velocity can always be recovered when both the
potential function and the position are supposed to be known. Finally, we prove
that by performing continuous measurements of the fluid potential over a time
interval, we can always track the position of the solid.

represented as two or more figures that can be have different properties to
each other. For the purpose of HCP, we represent a graph by two such figures.
In each of them, there is an exterior part called the contour, and an interior
part. These two figures differ from each other by the constitution of the edges
in the interior part. That is, any edges in the interior part for one figure
are not in the interior for the other figure. We call these two figures basic
objects. We develop rules and algorithms that allow us to represent any graph
of degree d <= 3 by two basic objects. Individually, neither of these
representations possess the features to easily determine the Hamiltonicity of
the graph. However, the combination of these two figures, once certain weights
are assigned to their edges, allows us to determine the Hamiltonicity with a
polynomial-time check. The rules for the assignment of weights are: 1. The
weight of any edge of the interior part is 0, for both objects. 2. In both
figures any common edge of the contour has the same weight. The weights of the
edges allow us to extend the number of parameters of the objects, that is
sufficient to determine the Hamiltonicity of the graph. Then, if the graph is
Hamiltonian, then both figures possess the same set of parameters. If the sets
of parameters for two figures are different, then the graph is not Hamiltonian.
The parameters that determine the Hamiltonicity of the graph are the sums of
weights of edges and windows of contours in the figure. The algorithms of their
construction do not contain a combinatorial number of elements and have
polynomial complexity. We also supply an estimate of the complexity of each
algorithm.

in Halpha region are presented for two rapidly rotating late-type stars: EY Dra
and V374 Peg. For a third rapid rotator, GSC 02038-00293, intermediate
resolution Halpha spectroscopy and low resolution spectroscopy are used for
spectral classification and stellar parameter investigation of this poorly
known object. The low resolution spectrum of GSC 02038-00293 clearly indicates
that it is a K-type star. Its intermediate resolution spectrum can be best
fitted with a model with Teff=4750K and vsini=90km/s, indicating a very rapidly
rotating mid-K star. The Halpha line strength is variable, indicating changing
chromospheric emission on GSC 02038-00293. In the case of EY Dra and V374 Peg,
the stellar activity in the photosphere is investigated from the photometric
observations, and in the chromosphere from the Halpha line. The enhanced
chromospheric emission in EY Dra correlates well with the location of the
photospheric active regions, indicating that these features are spatially
collocated. Hints of this behaviour are also seen in V374 Peg, but it cannot be
confirmed from the current data. The photospheric activity patterns in EY Dra
are stable during one observing run lasting several nights, whereas in V374 Peg
large night-to-night variations are seen. Two large flares, one in the Halpha
observations and one from the broadband photometry, and twelve smaller ones
were detected in V374 Peg during the observations spanning nine nights. The
energy of the photometrically detected largest flare is estimated to be
4.25x10^31 - 4.3x10^32 ergs, depending on the waveband. Comparing the activity
patterns in these two stars, which are just below and above the mass limit of
full convection, is crucial for understanding dynamo operation in stars with
different internal structures.

physics at the LHC in the form of flavor gauge bosons is predicted. The model
is also characterized by a depletion of the third generation couplings -- as
predicted by the general minimal flavor violation framework -- which can be
tested via flavor precision measurements. In particular, sizable CP violation
in Delta B=2 transitions can be obtained, and there is a natural region where
Bs mixing is predicted to be larger than Bd mixing, as favored by recent
Tevatron data. Unlike other proposals, the new contributions are not linked to

M_T sin(i) condition (ie. give information about) not only the planet's true
mass M_T but also the value of sin(i) for that system (where i is the orbital
inclination angle). Thus the value of sin(i) for a system with any particular
observed value of M_T sin(i) cannot be assumed to be drawn randomly from a
distribution corresponding to an isotropic i distribution, i.e. the presumptive
prior distribution . Rather, the posterior distribution from which it is drawn
depends on the intrinsic distribution of M_T for the exoplanet population being
studied. We give a simple Bayesian derivation of this relationship and apply it
to several ""toy models"" for the (currently unknown) intrinsic distribution of
M_T. The results show that the effect can be an important one. For example,
even for simple power-law distributions of M_T, the median value of sin(i) in
an observed RV sample can vary between 0.860 and 0.023 (as compared to the
0.866 value for an isotropic i distribution) for indices (alpha) of the
power-law in the range between -2 and +1, respectively. Over the same range of
indicies, the 95% confidence interval on M_T varies from 1.002-4.566 (alpha =
-2) to 1.13-94.34 (alpha = +1) times larger than M_T sin(i) due to sin(i)
uncertainty alone. Our qualitative conclusion is that RV studies of exoplanets,
both individual objects and statistical samples, should regard the sin(i)
factor as more than a ""numerical constant of order unity"" with simple and well
understood statistical properties. We argue that reports of M_T sin(i)
determinations should be accompanied by a statement of the corresponding
confidence bounds on M_T at, say, the 95% level based on an explicitly stated
assumed form of the true M_T distribution in order to more accurately reflect
the mass uncertainties associated with RV studies.

observing conditions such as night-sky brightness, photometric precision, and
seeing properties. Public meteorological data were also used in order to help
in the determination of the actual number of useful observing nights per year.
The measured zenithal $V$-band night-sky brightness is typical of that of very
good, very dark observing sites. The extinction registered at $V$ band is not
dissimilar from that of other sites. The median seeing over the period of in
situ observations is found to be $\sim1.7^{\prime\prime}$. Given the limited
duration of the observations, we did not probe any possible seeing seasonal
patterns, or the details of its possible dependence on other meteorological
parameters, such as wind speed and direction. Moreover, our data show that the
seeing at the observatory was reasonably stable during most of the nights. The
fraction of fully clear nights per year amounts to 39\%, while the total of
useful nights increases to 57\% assuming a (conservative) cloud cover of not
more than 50\% of the night. Based on the analysis of photometric data
collected over the period May-August 2009 for three stellar fields centered on
the transiting planet hosts WASP-3, HAT-P-7, and Gliese 436, we achieve
seeing-independent best-case photometric precision

high energy emission produced via inverse Compton scattering by the
synchrotron-emitting electrons in the jet. Quantitative tests of this scenario,

a finite Abelian group $(G,+,0)$, the invariant $\Dav_j(G)$ is defined as the
smallest $\ell$ such that each sequence over $G$ of length at least $\ell$ has
$j$ disjoint non-empty zero-sum subsequences. We investigate these quantities

predicted to be the largest. Keeping the gauge couplings below the critical
value that would lead to fermion condensation imposes further limits at large
axigluon mass, while precision electroweak constraints on the model are
relatively mild. Furthermore, by considering an extension to an SU(3)^3 color

The relay is
assumed to operate over an orthogonal band with respect to the underlying IC,
and the overall system is referred to as IC with an out-of-band relay (IC-OBR).
The system can be seen as operating over two parallel interference-limited
channels: The first is a standard Gaussian IC and the second is a Gaussian
relay channel characterized by two sources and destinations communicating
through the relay without direct links. We refer to the second parallel channel
as OBR Channel (OBRC). The main aim of this work is to identify conditions
under which optimal operation, in terms of the capacity region of the IC-OBR,
entails either signal relaying and/or interference forwarding by the relay,
with either a separable or non-separable use of the two parallel channels, IC
and OBRC. Here ""separable"" refers to transmission of independent information
over the two constituent channels. For a basic model in which the OBRC consists
of four orthogonal channels from sources to relay and from relay to
destinations (IC-OBR Type-I), a condition is identified under which signal
relaying and separable operation is optimal. When this condition is not
satisfied, various scenarios are identified in which interference forwarding
and non-separable operation are necessary to achieve optimal performance. In
these scenarios, the system exploits the ""excess capacity"" on the OBRC via
interference forwarding to drive the IC-OBR system in specific interference
regimes (strong or mixed). The analysis is then turned to a more complex
IC-OBR, in which the OBRC consists of only two orthogonal channels, one from
sources to relay and one from relay to destinations (IC-OBR Type-II). For this
channel, some capacity resuls are derived that parallel the conclusions for
IC-OBR Type-I.

dark matter candidate in a warped five-dimensional $SO(5) \times U(1)$
gauge-Higgs unification model. The stability of the gauge-Higgs boson is
guaranteed by the H parity under which only the Higgs boson is odd at low
energy. The 4-point vertices of HHW^+W^- and HHZZ, allowed by H parity
conservation, have the same magnitude as in the standard model, which yields
efficient annihilation rate for $m_H > m_W$. The most dominant annihilation
channel is $H H \to W^+ W^-$ followed by the subsequent decays of the $W$
bosons into positrons or quarks, which undergo fragmentation into antiproton.
Comparing with the observed positron and antiproton spectra with the PAMALA and
Fermi/LAT, we found that the Higgs boson mass cannot be larger than 90 GeV, in
order not to overrun the observations. Together with the constraint on not
overclosing the Universe, the valid range of the dark matter mass is restricted
to 70-90 GeV.

that before any event of N in [0,t] there exists an event-free interval greater

become intractable for very large values of t/s. Our main objective is to
demonstrate that these probabilities can be approximated extremely well for

towards the 9 sight lines with impact parameters ranging from 10 to 55 kpc
using GMRT. 21-cm absorption was detected only in one case i.e. towards the
Quasar (zq=2.625 SDSS J124157.54+633241.6)-galaxy (zg=0.143 SDSS
J124157.26+633237.6) pair with the impact parameter 11 kpc. The quasar sight
line in this case pierces through the stellar disk of a galaxy having near
solar metallicity (i.e (O/H)+12=8.7) and star formation rate uncorrected for
dust attenuation of 0.1 M_odot/yr. The quasar spectrum reddened by the
foreground galaxy is well fitted with the Milky Way extinction curve (with an
Av of 0.44) and the estimated HI column density is similar to the value
obtained from 21-cm absorption assuming spin temperature of 100K. Combining our
sample with the z<0.1 data available in the literature, we find the
detectability of 21-cm absorption with integrated optical depth greater than
0.1 km\s to be 50% for the impact parameter less than 20 kpc. Using the surface
brightness profiles and relationship between the optical size and extent of the
HI disk known for nearby galaxies, we conclude that in most of the cases of
21-cm absorption non-detection, the sight lines may not be passing through the
HI gas. We also find that in comparison to the absorption systems associated
with these QGPs, z<1 DLAs with 21-cm absorption detections have lower CaII
equivalent widths despite having higher 21-cm optical depths and smaller impact
parameters. This suggests that the current sample of DLAs may be a biased
population that avoids sight lines through dusty star-forming galaxies. A
systematic survey of QGPs is needed to confirm these findings and understand
the nature of 21-cm absorbers.

realize important many-body phenomena in their most simple and essential forms,
without many of the complexities usually associated with material systems.
However, the charge neutrality of these systems presents an apparent limitation
- a wide range of intriguing phenomena arise from the Lorentz force for charged
particles in a magnetic field, such as the fractional quantum Hall states in
two-dimensional electron systems. The limitation can be circumvented by
exploiting the equivalence of the Lorentz force and the Coriolis force to
create synthetic magnetic fields in rotating neutral systems. This was
demonstrated by the appearance of quantized vortices in pioneering experiments
on rotating quantum gases, a hallmark of superfluids or superconductors in a
magnetic field. However, because of technical issues limiting the maximum
rotation velocity, the metastable nature of the rotating state and the
difficulty of applying stable rotating optical lattices, rotational approaches
are not able to reach the large fields required for quantum Hall physics. Here,
we experimentally realize an optically synthesized magnetic field for ultracold
neutral atoms, made evident from the appearance of vortices in our
Bose-Einstein condensate. Our approach uses a spatially-dependent optical
coupling between internal states of the atoms, yielding a Berry's phase
sufficient to create large synthetic magnetic fields, and is not subject to the
limitations of rotating systems; with a suitable lattice configuration, it
should be possible to reach the quantum Hall regime, potentially enabling
studies of topological quantum computation.

Dirichlet Process, is increasingly being used for probabilistic modelling in
discrete areas such as language technology, bioinformatics, and image analysis.
There is a rich literature about the PDP and its derivative distributions such
as the Chinese Restaurant Process (CRP). This article reviews some of the basic
theory and then the major results needed for Bayesian modelling of discrete
problems including details of priors, posteriors and computation.
  The PDP allows one to build distributions over countable partitions. The PDP
has two other remarkable properties: first it is partially conjugate to itself,
which allows one to build hierarchies of PDPs, and second using a marginalised
relative the CRP, one gets fragmentation and clustering properties that lets
one layer partitions to build trees. This article presents the basic theory for
understanding the notion of partitions and distributions over them, the PDP and
the CRP, and the important properties of conjugacy, fragmentation and
clustering, as well as some key related properties such as consistency and
convergence. This article also presents a Bayesian interpretation of the
Poisson-Dirichlet process based on an improper and infinite dimensional
Dirichlet distribution. This means we can understand the process as just
another Dirichlet and thus all its sampling properties emerge naturally.
  The theory of PDPs is usually presented for continuous distributions (more
generally referred to as non-atomic distributions), however, when applied to
discrete distributions its remarkable conjugacy property emerges. This context
and basic results are also presented, as well as techniques for computing the
second order Stirling numbers that occur in the posteriors for discrete
distributions.

Hierarchy Process (AHP) methodology to guide decision makers in banking
industries to deal with information security policy. The model is structured
according aspects of information security policy in conjunction with
information security elements. We found that cultural aspect is valued on the
top priority among other security aspects, while confidentiality is considered
as the most important factor in terms of information security elements.

does not lie in the Polynomial-Time Hierarchy (PH). We advance a natural
conjecture about the capacity of the Nisan-Wigderson pseudorandom generator
[NW94] to fool AC_0, with MAJORITY as its hard function. Our conjecture is
essentially that the loss due to the hybrid argument (which is a component of
the standard proof from [NW94]) can be avoided in this setting. This is a
question that has been asked previously in the pseudorandomness literature
[BSW03]. We then make three main contributions: (1) We show that our conjecture
implies the existence of an oracle relative to which BQP is not in the PH. This
entails giving an explicit construction of unitary matrices, realizable by
small quantum circuits, whose row-supports are ""nearly-disjoint."" (2) We give a
simple framework (generalizing the setting of Aaronson [A10]) in which any
efficiently quantumly computable unitary gives rise to a distribution that can
be distinguished from the uniform distribution by an efficient quantum
algorithm. When applied to the unitaries we construct, this framework yields a
problem that can be solved quantumly, and which forms the basis for the desired
oracle. (3) We prove that Aaronson's ""GLN conjecture"" [A10] implies our
conjecture; our conjecture is thus formally easier to prove. The GLN conjecture
was recently proved false for depth greater than 2 [A10a], but it remains open
for depth 2. If true, the depth-2 version of either conjecture would imply an
oracle relative to which BQP is not in AM, which is itself an outstanding open
problem. Taken together, our results have the following interesting
interpretation: they give an instantiation of the Nisan-Wigderson generator
that can be broken by quantum computers, but not by the relevant modes of
classical computation, if our conjecture is true.

Neptune GJ436b at 3.6, 4.5 and $8~\mu$m obtained with the Infrared Array Camera
(IRAC) on the Spitzer Space Telescope. After correcting for systematic effects,
we fitted the light curves using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique.
Combining these new data with the EPOXI, HST and ground-based $V, I, H$ and
$K_s$ published observations, the range $0.5-10~\mu$m can be covered. Due to
the low level of activity of GJ436, the effect of starspots on the combination
of transits at different epochs is negligible at the accuracy of the dataset.
Representative climate models were calculated by using a three-dimensional,
pseudo-spectral general circulation model with idealised thermal forcing.
Simulated transit spectra of GJ436b were generated using line-by-line radiative
transfer models including the opacities of the molecular species expected to be
present in such a planetary atmosphere. A new, ab-initio calculated, linelist
for hot ammonia has been used for the first time. The photometric data observed
at multiple wavelengths can be interpreted with methane being the dominant
absorption after molecular hydrogen, possibly with minor contributions from
ammonia, water and other molecules. No clear evidence of carbon monoxide and
dioxide is found from transit photometry. We discuss this result in the light
of a recent paper where photochemical disequilibrium is hypothesised to
interpret secondary transit photometric data. We show that the emission

$\Gamma$. A self-dual normal basis for $F/E$ is a normal basis with the
additional property that $Tr_{F/E}(g(x),h(x))=\delta_{g,h}$ for $g,h\in\Gamma$.
Bayer-Fluckiger and Lenstra have shown that when $char(E)\neq 2$, then $F$
admits a self-dual normal basis if and only if $[F:E]$ is odd. If $F/E$ is an
extension of finite fields and $char(E)=2$, then $F$ admits a self-dual normal
basis if and only if the exponent of $\Gamma$ is not divisible by $4$. In this
paper we construct self-dual normal basis generators for finite extensions of
finite fields whenever they exist.
  Now let $K$ be a finite extension of $\Q_p$, let $L/K$ be a finite abelian
Galois extension of odd degree and let $\bo_L$ be the valuation ring of $L$. We
define $A_{L/K}$ to be the unique fractional $\bo_L$-ideal with square equal to
the inverse different of $L/K$. It is known that a self-dual integral normal
basis exists for $A_{L/K}$ if and only if $L/K$ is weakly ramified. Assuming
$p\neq 2$, we construct such bases whenever they exist.

of fixation that refers to the possibility that a few mutants take over the
entire population. Here, the fixation phenomenon is induced by large
fluctuations and is investigated by a semi-classical WKB
(Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin) theory generalized to treat stochastic systems
possessing multiple absorbing states. Importantly, this method allows us to
analyze the combined influence of selection and random fluctuations on the
evolutionary dynamics \textit{beyond} the weak selection limit often considered
in previous works. We accurately compute, including pre-exponential factors,
the probability distribution function in the long-lived coexistence state and
the mean fixation time necessary for a few mutants to take over the entire
population in anti-coordination games, and also the fixation probability in the
coordination class. Our analytical results compare excellently with extensive

Supervisor: Graham Kirby",,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This thesis investigates the application of autonomic management to a
distributed storage system. Effects on performance and resource consumption
were measured in experiments, which were carried out in a local area test-bed.
The experiments were conducted with components of one specific distributed
storage system, but seek to be applicable to a wide range of such systems, in
particular those exposed to varying conditions. The perceived characteristics
of distributed storage systems depend on their configuration parameters and on
various dynamic conditions. For a given set of conditions, one specific
configuration may be better than another with respect to measures such as
resource consumption and performance. Here, configuration parameter values were
set dynamically and the results compared with a static configuration. It was
hypothesised that under non-changing conditions this would allow the system to
converge on a configuration that was more suitable than any that could be set a
priori. Furthermore, the system could react to a change in conditions by
adopting a more appropriate configuration. Autonomic management was applied to
the peer-to-peer (P2P) and data retrieval components of ASA, a distributed
storage system. The effects were measured experimentally for various workload
and churn patterns. The management policies and mechanisms were implemented
using a generic autonomic management framework developed during this work. The
experimental evaluations of autonomic management show promising results, and
suggest several future research topics. The findings of this thesis could be
exploited in building other distributed storage systems that focus on
harnessing storage on user workstations, since these are particularly likely to
be exposed to varying, unpredictable conditions.

carried out, through which it is shown that the core of the magnetic obstacle
is streamlined both by the upstream flow and by the induced cross stream
electric currents, like a foreign insulated insertion placed inside the
ordinary hydrodynamic flow. The closed streamlines of the mass flow resemble
contour lines of electric potential, while closed streamlines of the electric
current resemble contour lines of pressure. New recirculation patterns not
reported before are found in the series of 2D simulations. These are composed
of many (even number) vortices aligned along the spanwise line crossing the
magnetic gap. The intensities of these vortices are shown to vanish toward to
the center of the magnetic gap, confirming the general conclusion of 3D

rings are i) the intrinsic brightening of particles due to coherent
backscattering and/or shadow-hiding on their surfaces, and ii) the reduced
interparticle shadowing. We utilize the Hubble Space Telescope observations for
different elevation angles B to disentangle these contributions. We assume that
the intrinsic contribution is independent of B, so that any B dependence of the
phase curves is due to interparticle shadowing, which must also act similarly
for all colors. We construct a grid of dynamical/photometric simulation models
to fit the elevation-dependent part of opposition brightening. Eliminating the
modeled interparticle component yields the intrinsic contribution to the
opposition effect: for the B and A rings it is almost entirely due to coherent
backscattering; for the C ring, an intraparticle shadow hiding contribution may
also be present.
  Based on our simulations, the width of the interparticle shadowing effect is
roughly proportional to B. This follows from the observation that as B
decreases, the scattering is primarily from the rarefied low filling factor
upper ring layers, whereas at larger $B$'s the dense inner parts are visible.
The elevation angle dependence of interparticle shadowing also explains most of
the B ring tilt effect (the increase of brightness with elevation). From
comparison of the magnitude of the tilt effect at different filters, we show
that multiple scattering can account for at most a 10% brightness increase as B
-> 26^o, whereas the remaining 20% brightening is due to a variable degree of
interparticle shadowing. The negative tilt effect of the middle A ring is well
explained by the the same self-gravity wake models that account for the
observed A ring azimuthal brightness asymmetry.

Obscured Galaxies (DOGs) in the Chandra Deep Fields (CDF). We find 26 X-ray
selected sources which obey the 24 micron to R-band flux ratio criterion
f_24/f_R>1000. These are at a median redshift of 2.3 while their IR
luminosities are above 10^12 solar. Their X-ray luminosities are all above a
few times 10^42 erg s-1 in the 2-10 keV band unambiguously arguing that these
host AGN. Nevertheless, their IR Spectral Energy Distributions are split
between AGN (Mrk231) and star-forming templates (Arp220). Our primary goal is
to examine their individual X-ray spectra in order to assess whether this X-ray
detected DOG population contains heavily obscured or even Compton-thick
sources. The X-ray spectroscopy reveals a mixed bag of objects. We find that
four out of the 12 sources with adequate photon statistics and hence reliable
X-ray spectra, show evidence for a hard X-ray spectral index (~1) or
harder,consistent with a Compton-thick spectrum. In total 12 out of the 26 DOGs
show evidence for flat spectral indices. However, owing to the limited photon
statistics we cannot differentiate whether these are flat because they are
reflection-dominated or because they show moderate amounts of absorption. Seven
DOGs show relatively steep spectra (>1.4) indicative of small column densities.
All the above suggest a fraction of Compton-thick sources that does not exceed
5%. The average X-ray spectrum of all 26 DOGs is hard (~1.1) or even harder
(~0.6) when we exclude the brightest sources. These spectral indices are well
in agreement with the stacked spectrum of X-ray undetected sources (~0.8 in the
CDFN). This could suggest (but not necessarily prove) that X-ray undetected
DOGs, in a similar fashion to the X-ray detected ones presented here, are
hosting a moderate fraction of Compton-thick sources.

developing fast-cycling accelerators, dubbed 'cyclinacs'. These are a
combination of a cyclotron (accelerating ions to a fixed initial energy)
followed by a high gradient linac boosting the ions energy up to the maximum
needed for medical therapy. The linac is powered by many independently
controlled klystrons to vary the beam energy from one pulse to the next. This
accelerator is best suited to treat moving organs with a 4D multi-painting spot
scanning technique. A dual proton/carbon ion cyclinac is here presented. It
consists of an Electron Beam Ion Source, a superconducting isochronous
cyclotron and a high-gradient linac. All these machines are pulsed at high
repetition rate (100-400 Hz). The source should deliver both C6+ and H2+ ions
in short pulses (1.5 {\mu}s flat-top) and with sufficient intensity (at least
108 fully stripped carbon ions at 300 Hz). The cyclotron accelerates the ions
to 120 MeV/u. It features a compact design (with superconducting coils) and a
low power consumption. The linac has a novel C-band high gradient structure and
accelerates the ions to variable energies up to 400 MeV/u. High RF frequencies
lead to power consumptions which are much lower than the ones of synchrotrons
for the same ion extraction energy. This work is part of a collaboration with
the CLIC group, which is working at CERN on high-gradient electron-positron
colliders.

we correct STE by forming the ranks for the future samples of the response
system with regard to the current reconstructed vector. We give the grounds for
this modified version of STE, which we call Transfer Entropy on Rank Vectors
(TERV). Then we propose to use more than one step ahead in the formation of the
future of the response in order to capture the information flow from the
driving system over a longer time horizon. To assess the performance of STE, TE
and TERV in detecting correctly the information flow we use receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curves formed by the measure values in the two coupling
directions computed on a number of realizations of known weakly coupled
systems. We also consider different settings of state space reconstruction,
time series length and observational noise. The results show that TERV indeed
improves STE and in some cases performs better than TE, particularly in the
presence of noise, but overall TE gives more consistent results. The use of
multiple steps ahead improves the accuracy of TE and TERV.

spectrum and breaks the valley symmetry. The resulting effective electronic
model, which is similar to Haldane's periodic flux model, allows us to tune the
gap of one valley independently from that of the other valley. This leads to
the formation of two Hall plateaux and a quantum Hall transition. We discuss
the density of states, optical longitudinal and Hall conductivities for nonzero
frequencies and nonzero temperatures. A robust logarithmic singularity appears
in the Hall conductivity when the frequency of the external field agrees with
the width of the gap.

author (STACS 2006) and a first experimental evaluation on random instances
(ALENEX 2009), we investigate how the recently developed different approaches
to generate randomized roundings satisfying disjoint cardinality constraints
behave when used in two classical algorithmic problems, namely low-congestion
routing in networks and max-coverage problems in hypergraphs.
  We generally find that all randomized rounding algorithms work well, much
better than what is guaranteed by existing theoretical work. The derandomized
versions produce again significantly better rounding errors, with running times
still negligible compared to the one for solving the corresponding LP. It thus
seems worth preferring them over the randomized variants.
  The data created in these experiments lets us propose and investigate the
following new ideas. For the low-congestion routing problems, we suggest to
solve a second LP, which yields the same congestion, but aims at producing a
solution that is easier to round. Experiments show that this reduces the
rounding errors considerably, both in combination with randomized and
derandomized rounding.
  For the max-coverage instances, we generally observe that the greedy
heuristics also performs very good. We develop a strengthened method of
derandomized rounding, and a simple greedy/rounding hybrid approach using
greedy and LP-based rounding elements, and observe that both these improvements
yield again better solutions than both earlier approaches on their own.
  For unit disk max-domination, we also develop a PTAS. Contrary to all other
algorithms investigated, it performs not much better in experiments than in
theory; thus, unless extremely good solutions are to be obtained with huge
computational resources, greedy, LP-based rounding or hybrid approaches are
preferable.

show that the vibrations of DNA backbone chains near 15 cm-1 have the greatest

modes of H-bond stretching in base pairs have the greatest intensities, while
the modes of ion-phosphate vibrations have the lowest intensity. In Cs-DNA

prominent. Its intensity is much higher than the intensities of Na-DNA modes of

magnified up to potentially observable levels if the scalar field to be probed
has high mean energy from an inertial perspective: The Unruh-Hawking effect
acts like an amplification channel. We prove that a field in a Fock inertial
state, probed via photon counting by a non-inertial detector, realizes the
optimal strategy attaining the ultimate sensitivity allowed by quantum
mechanics for the observation of the effect. We define the parameter regime in
which the effect can be reliably revealed in laboratory experiments, regardless
of the specific implementation.

two of us in [1], with observational data from supernovae, CMB shift, baryon
acoustic oscillations, x-rays, and the Hubble rate. The growth function for
this model is also studied. The model fits the data reasonably well but still
the conventional $\Lambda$CDM model fares better. Nevertheless, the holographic
model greatly alleviates the coincidence problem and shows compatibility at
$1\sigma$ confidence level with the age of the old quasar APM 08279+5255.
