for instance, artificial intelligence, database theory, graph theory, and
statistical physics. From a practical viewpoint, it is beneficial to
approximately solve those CSPs. When one tries to approximate the total number
of truth assignments that satisfy all Boolean-valued constraints for
(unweighted) Boolean CSPs, there is a known trichotomy theorem by which all
such counting problems are neatly classified into exactly three categories
under polynomial-time (randomized) approximation-preserving reductions. In
contrast, we obtain a dichotomy theorem of approximate counting for
complex-weighted Boolean CSPs, provided that all complex-valued unary
constraints are freely available to use. It is the expressive power of free
unary constraints that enables us to prove such a stronger, complete
classification theorem. This discovery makes a step forward in the quest for
the approximation-complexity classification of all counting CSPs. To deal with
complex weights, we employ proof techniques of factorization and arity
reduction along the line of solving Holant problems. Moreover, we introduce a
novel notion of T-constructibility that naturally induces
approximation-preserving reducibility. Our result also gives an approximation
analogue of the dichotomy theorem on the complexity of exact counting for
complex-weighted Boolean CSPs.

been known for a long time that in dimension 1 there is no non-trivial
Hamiltonian with the distributional potential $\delta'$, i.e., the $\delta'$
potential acts as a totally reflecting wall. Several authors have, in recent
years, studied the scattering properties of the regularizing potentials
$\alpha\eps^{-2}Q(x/\eps)$ approximating the first derivative of the Dirac
delta function. A non-zero transmission through the regularized potential has
been shown to exist as $\eps\to0$. We extend these results to star graphs with
the point interaction, which is an analogue of $\delta'$ potential on the line.
We prove that generically such a potential on the graph is opaque. We also show
that there exists a countable set of resonant intensities for which a partial
transmission through the potential occurs. This set of resonances is referred
to as the resonant set and is determined as the spectrum of an auxiliary
Sturm-Liouville problem associated with $Q$ on the graph.

in the thermodynamic limit the mapping is thoroughly understood, we here focus
on aspects that become relevant in spatially inhomogeneous situations, such as
the effect of boundaries, impurities, superlattices and interfaces. We consider
parameter regimes that are relevant for traditional applications of these
models, such as electrons in cuprates and manganites, and for more recent
applications to atoms in optical lattices. The rate of the mapping as a
function of the interaction strength is determined from the Bethe-Ansatz for
infinite systems and from numerical diagonalization for finite systems. We show
analytically that if translational symmetry is broken through the presence of
impurities, the mapping persists and is, in a certain sense, as local as
possible, provided the spin-spin interaction between two sites of the
Heisenberg model is calculated from the harmonic mean of the onsite Coulomb
interaction on adjacent sites of the Hubbard model. Numerical calculations
corroborate these findings also in interfaces and superlattices, where
analytical calculations are more complicated.

stars are single, in contrast to the results of prior multiplicity studies. The
orbital-period distribution of companions is unimodal and roughly log-normal
with a peak of about 300 years. The period-eccentricity relation shows a
roughly flat distribution beyond the expected circularization for periods below
12 days. The mass-ratio distribution shows a preference for like-mass pairs,
which occur more frequently in relatively close pairs. The fraction of planet
hosts among single, binary, and multiple systems are statistically

a craterwith a diameter of 31 - 39 km. The largest Plutino impactor onto Charon
has a diameter between 10 and 15 km, which produces a crater with a diameter of
24 - 33 km. We test if 2 Pluto-sized objects are assumed in the 3:2 Neptune
resonance, then the total number of Plutino impactors both onto Pluto as Charon
with diameters D > 1 km is a factor of 1.6 - 1.8 larger if considering 1
Pluto-sized object. Given the dynamical structure of the trans-Neptunian
region, it is necessary to study in detail the contribution of all the
potential sources of impactors on the Pluto-Charon system, to obtain the main
contributor and the whole production of craters. Then, we will be able to
contrast those studies with observations which will help us to understand the
geological processes and history of the surface of those worlds.

separately clarify and identify the consequences of the two punishing

evolutionary competition in case of well-mixed interactions. When spatial
interactions are taken into account, however, the outcome can be strikingly
different, and cooperation may spread. The underlying mechanism depends on the
character of the punishment strategy. In case of cooperating punishers,
increasing the fine results in a rising cooperation level. In contrast, in the
presence of the PD strategy, the phase diagram exhibits a reentrant transition
as the fine is increased. Accordingly, the level of cooperation shows a
non-monotonous dependence on the fine. Remarkably, punishing strategies can
spread in both cases, but based on largely different mechanisms, which depend

magnetic field. In each case two snapshots are analyzed, separated by one
turn-over time, starting just after the peak of dissipation. We show that the

for each snapshot and that the statistical properties of these clusters are

also study the effect of Reynolds number on cluster statistics, and we finally

multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar with application to direction
finding for multiple targets. The general angular directions of the targets are
assumed to be located within a certain spatial sector. We focus the energy of
multiple (two or more) transmitted orthogonal waveforms within that spatial
sector using transmit beamformers which are designed to improve the
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain at each receive antenna. The subspace
decomposition-based techniques such as MUSIC can then be used for direction
finding for multiple targets. Moreover, the transmit beamformers can be
designed so that matched-filtering the received data to the waveforms yields
multiple (two or more) data sets with rotational invariance property that
allows applying search-free direction finding techniques such as ESPRIT for two
data sets or parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) for more than two data sets.
Unlike previously reported MIMO radar ESPRIT/PARAFAC-based direction finding
techniques, our method achieves the rotational invariance property in a
different manner combined also with the transmit energy focusing. As a result,
it achieves better estimation performance at lower computational cost.
Particularly, the proposed technique leads to lower Cramer-Rao bound than the
existing techniques due to the transmit energy focusing capability. Simulation
results also show the superiority of the proposed technique over the existing
techniques.

by the claim of a terrestrial extinction periodicity, thought to be mediated by
comet showers. The orbit of a distant companion to the Sun is expected to be
perturbed by the Galactic tidal field and encounters with passing stars, which
will induce variation in the period. We examine the evidence for the previously
proposed periodicity, using two modern, greatly improved paleontological
datasets of fossil biodiversity. We find that there is a narrow peak at 27 My
in the cross-spectrum of extinction intensity time series between these
independent datasets. This periodicity extends over a time period nearly twice
that for which it was originally noted. An excess of extinction events are
associated with this periodicity at 99% confidence. In this sense we confirm
the originally noted feature in the time series for extinction. However, we
find that it displays extremely regular timing for about 0.5 Gy. The regularity
of the timing compared with earlier calculations of orbital perturbation would
seem to exclude the Nemesis hypothesis as a causal factor.

polarization sensitivity of 0.1%, at a resolving power of 1500. HS1603+3820 has
been the target of a high-resolution spectroscopic monitoring campaign for more
than four years, aimed at studying its highly variable C IV mini-BAL profile.
Using the monitoring observations, in an earlier paper we were able to narrow
down the causes of the variability to the following two scenarios: (1)
scattering material of variable optical depth redirecting photons around the
absorber, and (2) a variable, highly-ionized screen between the continuum
source and the absorber which modulates the UV continuum incident on the
absorber. The observations presented here provide a crucial test of the
scattering scenario and lead us to disfavor it because (a) the polarization
level is very small (p~0.6%) throughout the spectrum, and (b) the polarization
level does not increase across the mini-BAL trough. Thus, the variable screen
scenario emerges as our favored explanation of the C IV mini-BAL variability.
Our conclusion is bolstered by recent X-ray observations of nearby mini-BAL
quasars, which show a rapidly variable soft X-ray continuum that appears to be
the result of transmission through an ionized absorber of variable ionization
parameter and optical depth.

Mealy in 1989 on calibrations in semi-riemannian geometry where split SLAG
geometry was first introduced. The natural setting is provided by doing
geometry with the complex numbers C replaced by the double numbers D, where i
with i^2 = -1 is replaced by tau with tau^2 = 1. A rather surprising amount of
complex geometry carries over, almost untouched, and this has been the subject
of many papers. We briefly review this material and, in particular, we discuss
Hermitian D-manifolds with trivial canonical bundle, which provide the
background space for the geometry of split SLAG submanifolds.
  A removable singularities result is proved for split SLAG subvarieties. It
implies, in particular, that there exist no split SLAG cones, smooth outside
the origin, other than planes. This is in sharp contrast to the complex case.
  Parallel to the complex case, space-like Lagrangian submanifolds are
stationary if and only if they are theta-split SLAG for some phase angle theta,
and infinitesimal deformations of split SLAG submanifolds are characterized by
harmonic 1-forms on the submanifold.
  We also briefly review the recent work of Kim, McCann and Warren who have
shown that split Special Lagrangian geometry is directly related to the
Monge-Kantorovich mass transport problem.

distribution of vacancies, which can be exploited for engineering many-body
entangled spin states. We consider the dynamics of magnetic exciton wavepackets

economic agents. A simple analogy compares the wealth in a society with the
energy in a physical system, and the trade between agents to the energy
exchange between molecules during collisions. However, while in physical
systems the equipartition of energy is valid, in most exchange models for
economic markets the system converges to a very unequal ""condensed"" state,
where one or a few agents concentrate all the wealth of the society and the
wide majority of agents shares zero or a very tiny fraction of the wealth. Here
we present an exchange model where the goal is not only to avoid condensation
but also to reduce the inequality; to carry out this objective the choice of
interacting agents is not at random, but follows an extremal dynamics regulated
by the wealth of the agent. The wealth of the agent with the minimum capital is
changed at random and the difference between the ancient and the new wealth of
this poorest agent is taken from other agents, so establishing a regulatory
tool for wealth redistribution. We compare different redistribution processes
and conclude that a drastic reduction of the inequality can be obtained with
very simple regulations.

core-collapse supernova in two spatial dimensions. We find that our model
displays a strong tendency to expand toward the pole. We demonstrate that this
expansion is a physical property of the low-mode, SASI instability. The SASI
leaves behind a large lateral velocity gradient in the post shock layer which
affects the evolution for minutes and hours later. This results in a prolate
deformation of the ejecta and a fast advection of Ni-rich material from
moderate latitudes to the polar regions. This effect might actually be
responsible for the global asymmetry of the nickel lines in SN 1987A. The
simulations demonstrate that significant radial and lateral motions in the
post-shock region, produced by convective overturn and the SASI during the
early explosion phase, contribute to the evolution for minutes and hours after
shock revival. They lead to both later clump formation, and a significant
prolate deformation of the ejecta which are observed even as late as one week
after the explosion. As pointed out recently by Kjaer et al., such an ejecta
morphology is in good agreement with the observational data of SN 1987A.
Systematic future studies are needed to investigate how the SASI-induced
late-time lateral expansion depends on the dominant mode of the SASI, and to
which extent it is affected by the dimensionality of the simulations. The
impact on and importance of the SASI for the distribution of iron group nuclei
and the morphology of the young SNR argues for future three-dimensional
explosion and post-explosion studies on singularity-free grids that cover the
entire sphere. Given the results of our 2D resolution study, present 3D
simulations must be regarded as underresolved, and their conclusions must be
verified by a proper numerical convergence analysis in three dimensions.

insensitive to small variations of the interaction potential and to the

developed. Appreciating significance of the challenging problem of the
classical turbulence it can be expressed that the idea to study it in terms of
quantized line is indeed very important and may be regarded as a breakthrough.
For this reason, this theory should be carefully scrutinized. One of the basic
arguments supporting this point of view is the fact that vortex tangle decays
at zero temperature, when the apparent mechanism of dissipation (mutual
friction) is absent. Since the all possible mechanisms of dissipation of the
vortex energy, discussed in the literature, are related to the small scales, it
is natural to suggest that the Kolmogorov cascade takes the place with the flow
of the energy, just as in the classical turbulence. In a series of recent
experiment attenuation of vortex line density was observed and authors
attribute this decay to the properties of the Kolmogorov turbulence. In the
present work we discuss alternative possibility of decay of the vortex tangle,
which is not related to dissipation at small scales. This mechanism is just the
diffusive like spreading of the vortex tangle. We discuss a number of the key
experiments, considering them both from the point of view of alternative
explanation and of the theory of Kolmogorov turbulence in quantum fluids.

derived, and the maximum energy of a photon from 3C 454.3 is ~ 20 GeV. The
spectral break at a few GeV is inconsistent with Klein-Nishina softening from
power-law electrons scattering Ly_alpha line radiation, and a break in the

first-order electroweak phase transition, which is conducive to baryogenesis in
the early Universe. In the T parity symmetric theory, there are two gauge
sectors, viz., the T-even and the T-odd ones. We observe that the effect of the
T-parity symmetric interactions between the T-odd and the T-even gauge bosons
on gauge-higgs energy functional is quite small, so that these two sectors can
be taken to be independent. The T-even gauge bosons behave like the Standard
Model gauge bosons, whereas the T-odd ones are instrumental in stabilizing the
Higgs mass. For the T-odd gauge bosons in the symmetric and asymmetric phases
and for the T-even gauge bosons in the asymmetric phase, we obtain, using the
formalism of Arnold and McLerran, very small values of the ratio, (Baryon
number violation rate/Universe expansion rate). We observe that this result, in
conjunction with the scenario of inverse phase transition in the present work
and the value of the ratio obtained from the lattice result of sphaleron
transition rate in the symmetric phase, can provide us with a plausible
baryogenesis scenario.

allows one to analyze the space that otherwise would remain intractable. The
regular representation of this algebra in a bundle of Hilbert spaces leads to a
von Neumann algebra of random operators. In this way, a probabilistic

arise in the application of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna
wireless communication systems: the distribution of the mutual information of
multi-antenna Gaussian channels, and the Gallager random coding upper bound on
the error probability achievable by finite-length channel codes. It turns out
that the mathematical problem underpinning both quantities is the computation
of certain Hankel determinants generated by deformed versions of classical
weight functions. For single-user MIMO systems, it is a deformed Laguerre
weight, whereas for multi-user MIMO systems it is a deformed Jacobi weight. We
apply two different methods to characterize each of these Hankel determinants.
First, we employ the ladder operators of the corresponding monic orthogonal
polynomials to give an exact characterization of the Hankel determinants in
terms of Painlev\'{e} differential equations. This turns out to be a
Painlev\'{e} V for the single-user MIMO scenario and a Painlev\'{e} VI for the
multi user scenario. We then employ Coulomb fluid methods to derive new
closed-form approximations for the Hankel determinants which, although formally
valid for large matrix dimensions, are shown to give accurate results for both
the MIMO mutual information distribution and the error exponent even when the
matrix dimensions are small. Focusing on the single-user mutual information
distribution, we then employ both the exact Painlev\'{e} representation and the
Coulomb fluid approximation to yield deeper insights into the scaling behavior
in terms of the number of antennas and signal-to-noise ratio. Among other
things, these results allow us to study the asymptotic Gaussianity of the
distribution as the number of antennas increase, and to explicitly compute the
correction terms to the mean, variance, and higher order cumulants.

  Penalty","12 pages, 4 figures, 1 table",,,,"stat.ML q-bio.MN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Components of biological systems interact with each other in order to carry
out vital cell functions. Such information can be used to improve estimation
and inference, and to obtain better insights into the underlying cellular
mechanisms. Discovering regulatory interactions among genes is therefore an
important problem in systems biology. Whole-genome expression data over time
provides an opportunity to determine how the expression levels of genes are
affected by changes in transcription levels of other genes, and can therefore
be used to discover regulatory interactions among genes.
  In this paper, we propose a novel penalization method, called truncating
lasso, for estimation of causal relationships from time-course gene expression
data. The proposed penalty can correctly determine the order of the underlying
time series, and improves the performance of the lasso-type estimators.
Moreover, the resulting estimate provides information on the time lag between
activation of transcription factors and their effects on regulated genes. We
provide an efficient algorithm for estimation of model parameters, and show
that the proposed method can consistently discover causal relationships in the
large $p$, small $n$ setting. The performance of the proposed model is
evaluated favorably in simulated, as well as real, data examples. The proposed

coupled to a scalar field with an arbitrary potential in the weak gravity
limit. We show that this is only possible in a singular limit where the
black-hole horizon marginally traps a curvature singularity. Depending on the
subleading terms in the potential, a rich variety of continuous phase
transitions arise. Our examples include second and higher order, including the
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless type. In the case when the scalar is dilaton,
the condition for a continuous phase transition lead to (asymptotically)
linear-dilaton background. We obtain the scaling laws of thermodynamic
functions, as well as the viscosity coefficients near the transition. In the
limit of weak gravitational interactions, the bulk viscosity asymptotes to a
universal constant, independent of the details of the scalar potential. As a
byproduct of our analysis we obtain a one-parameter family of kink solutions in
arbitrary dimension d that interpolate between AdS near the boundary and
linear-dilaton background in the deep interior. The continuous Hawking-Page
transitions found here serve as holographic models for normal-to superfluid
transitions.

quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) antiferromagnetic (AF) system (weakly coupled
quantum spin-1/2 chains) in the presence of the external magnetic field is
calculated. The field dependence of the critical exponents for correlation
functions of 1D subsystems plays a very important role. It determines the
region of possible re-entrant phase transition, governed by the field. It is
shown how the quantum critical point between two phases of the 1D subsystem,
caused by spin-frustrating next-nearest neighbor (NNN) and multi-spin ring-like
exchanges, affects the field dependence of the ordering temperature. Our
results qualitatively agree with the features, observed in experiments on
quasi-1D AF systems.

basic principles of standard computational methods, categorizing them according
to three criteria---choice of problem, basis, and solution technique---that can
be used to classify proposals for the Casimir problem as well. In this way,
mature classical methods can be exploited to model Casimir physics, with a few

We show that the 1-skeleton
of $T$ may be oriented so that there is a global bound on the outdegree of the
vertices. Our application is to construct extremal metrics on triangulations
formed from $T$ by attaching new edges and vertices and subdividing its faces.
Such refinements provide a mechanism of convergence of the discrete
triangulation to the classical surface. We will prove a bound on the distortion
of the discrete extremal lengths of path families on $T$ under the refinement
process. Our bound will depend only on the refinement and not on $T$. In
particular, the result does not require bounded degree.
