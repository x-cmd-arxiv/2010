  565-580",,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An approach to the revision of logic programs under the answer set semantics
is presented. For programs P and Q, the goal is to determine the answer sets
that correspond to the revision of P by Q, denoted P * Q. A fundamental
principle of classical (AGM) revision, and the one that guides the approach
here, is the success postulate. In AGM revision, this stipulates that A is in K
* A. By analogy with the success postulate, for programs P and Q, this means
that the answer sets of Q will in some sense be contained in those of P * Q.
The essential idea is that for P * Q, a three-valued answer set for Q,
consisting of positive and negative literals, is first determined. The positive
literals constitute a regular answer set, while the negated literals make up a
minimal set of naf literals required to produce the answer set from Q. These
literals are propagated to the program P, along with those rules of Q that are
not decided by these literals. The approach differs from work in update logic
programs in two main respects. First, we ensure that the revising logic program
has higher priority, and so we satisfy the success postulate; second, for the
preference implicit in a revision P * Q, the program Q as a whole takes
precedence over P, unlike update logic programs, since answer sets of Q are
propagated to P. We show that a core group of the AGM postulates are satisfied,
as are the postulates that have been proposed for update logic programs.

In this
market, short-term licenses shall be given to wireless nodes for communication
in their local neighborhood. In contrast to the primary market, channels can be
assigned to multiple bidders, provided that the corresponding devices are well
separated such that the interference is sufficiently low. Interference
conflicts are described in terms of a conflict graph in which the nodes
represent the bidders and the edges represent conflicts such that the feasible
allocations for a channel correspond to the independent sets in the conflict
graph.
  In this paper, we suggest a novel LP formulation for combinatorial auctions
with conflict graph using a non-standard graph parameter, the so-called
inductive independence number. Taking into account this parameter enables us to
bypass the well-known lower bound of \Omega(n^{1-\epsilon}) on the
approximability of independent set in general graphs with n nodes (bidders). We
achieve significantly better approximation results by showing that interference
constraints for wireless networks yield conflict graphs with bounded inductive
independence number.
  Our framework covers various established models of wireless communication,
e.g., the protocol or the physical model. For the protocol model, we achieve an
O(\sqrt{k})-approximation, where k is the number of available channels. For the
more realistic physical model, we achieve an O(\sqrt{k} \log^2 n) approximation
based on edge-weighted conflict graphs. Combining our approach with the the
LP-based framework of Lavi and Swamy, we obtain incentive compatible mechanisms
for general bidders with arbitrary valuations on bundles of channels specified
in terms of demand oracles.

in a distributed storage system. A source has a data object which it can code
and store over a set of storage nodes; it is allowed to store any amount of
coded data in each node, as long as the total amount of storage used does not
exceed the given budget. A data collector subsequently attempts to recover the
original data object by accessing each of the nodes independently with some
constant probability. By using an appropriate code, successful recovery occurs
when the total amount of data in the accessed nodes is at least the size of the
original data object. The goal is to find an optimal storage allocation that
maximizes the probability of successful recovery. This optimization problem is
challenging because of its discrete nature and nonconvexity, despite its simple
formulation. Symmetric allocations (in which all nonempty nodes store the same
amount of data), though intuitive, may be suboptimal; the problem is nontrivial
even if we optimize over only symmetric allocations. Our main result shows that
the symmetric allocation that spreads the budget maximally over all nodes is
asymptotically optimal in a regime of interest. Specifically, we derive an
upper bound for the suboptimality of this allocation and show that the
performance gap vanishes asymptotically in the specified regime. Further, we
explicitly find the optimal symmetric allocation for a variety of cases. Our
results can be applied to distributed storage systems and other problems

record current-voltage (I-V) curves. Because each island forms a double barrier
tunnel junction (DBTJ) structure with the STM tip and the substrate, they would
be expected to exhibit single electron tunneling (SET) according to the
orthodox model of SET. Some of the islands formed are small enough (diameter <
10 nm) to exhibit SET at room temperature and evidence of SET has been
identified in some of the I-V curves recorded from these small islands. Those

exhibit SET did not do so, and the reasons for the absence of observable SET

be a wide depletion region in the substrate and Schottky barrier lowering due
to Fermi level pinning by surface states of the clean silicon near the islands.

(""passivated surfaces"") where the silicon surface surrounding the islands was
passivated with a native oxide. Other samples (""clean surfaces"") remained in

factors for islands on both surfaces, the effects of the non-passivated
surfaces on conduction were studied. The clean surface barrier heights were
found to be ~0.2 to 0.3 eV below barrier heights measured from similar islands
on passivated surfaces. The reduced Schottky barrier is mainly attributed to
Fermi level pinning by non-passivated surface states of the clean silicon
surface. However, the measured barrier heights of the clean surface islands are
equivalent on both Si(111) and Si(100), suggesting that the non-passivated
surfaces are influenced by cobalt impurities. Furthermore, the barrier heights
of islands on the clean surfaces are lower than due to Fermi level pinning
alone and the additional barrier height lowering is primarily attributed to
spreading resistance effects. Schottky barrier inhomogeneity may also cause
additional barrier height lowering and non-ideality in the contacts. The clean
surface barrier heights decreased and the ideality factors increased with
decreasing temperature, which is attributed to the temperature variation of the
Fermi level.

Lac searches are so far the only systematic surveys of the SDSS database

combining low- and high-redshift WLQ samples will yield new insight on our

100deg^2 area in the Taurus molecular cloud. We compare the H2 column density
derived from dust extinction with the CO column density derived from the 12CO

determined from 2MASS data. The comparison is done at an angular size of 200"",
corresponding to 0.14pc at a distance of 140pc. We find that the relation
between visual extinction Av and N(CO) is linear between Av~3 and 10 mag in the
region associated with the B213--L1495 filament. In other regions the linear
relation is flattened for Av > 4 mag. We find that the presence of temperature
gradients in the molecular gas affects the determination of N(CO) by ~30--70%
with the largest difference occurring at large column densities. Adding a
correction for this effect and accounting for the observed relation between the
column density of CO and CO2 ices and Av, we find a linear relationship between
the column of carbon monoxide and dust for observed visual extinctions up to
the maximum value in our data 23mag. We have used these data to study a sample
of dense cores in Taurus. Fitting an analytical column density profile to these
cores we derive an average volume density of about 1.4e4 cm^-3 and a CO
depletion age of about 4.2e5 years. We estimate the H2 mass of Taurus to be
about 1.5e4 M_sun, independently derived from the Av and N(CO) maps. We derive
a CO integrated intensity to H2 conversion factor of about 2.1e20 cm^-2 (K
km/s)^-1, which applies even in the region where the [CO]/[H_2] ratio is
reduced by up to two orders of magnitude. The distribution of column densities

by stellar merging, although more recent theoretical investigations suggest
that the radiative-pressure limit may be overcome by considering more complex,

continuum emission from dusty circumstellar disks in the ~1 Myr-old Ophiuchus

that emit significantly lower millimeter luminosities (hence dust masses), down
to the median value for T Tauri stars. Using a Monte Carlo radiative transfer
code, the millimeter visibilities and broadband spectral energy distribution
for each disk are simultaneously reproduced with a two-dimensional parametric
model for a viscous accretion disk. We find wide ranges of characteristic radii
(14-198 AU) and disk masses (0.004-0.143 M_sun), but a narrow distribution of
surface density gradients (0.4-1.1) that is consistent with a uniform value
$\gamma$ = 0.9 +/- 0.2 and independent of mass (or millimeter luminosity). In
this sample, we find a correlation between the disk luminosity/mass and
characteristic radius, such that fainter disks are both smaller and less
massive. We suggest that this relationship is an imprint of the initial
conditions inherited by the disks at their formation epoch, compare their
angular momenta with those of molecular cloud cores, and speculate on how
future observations can help constrain the distribution of viscous evolution
timescales. No other correlations between disk and star properties are found.
The inferred disk structures are briefly compared with theoretical models for
giant planet formation, although resolution limitations do not permit us to
directly comment on material inside R = 20 AU. However, there is some
compelling evidence for dust evolution in the planet formation region: 4/17
disks in the sample show resolved regions of significantly reduced optical
depths within ~20-40 AU of their central stars.

up with globular cluster systems in which individual clusters have

both M31 and the Galaxy are found to have radii that are independent of their

early-type galaxies in which half-light radius and luminosity are tightly
correlated. Metal-rich globular clusters in M31 occupy a slightly larger volume

correct description of heavy fermion metals and Kondo insulators: it reproduces
the Kondo-like scaling of the quasiparticle mass in the former, and the same

survives the confinement, and could be probed in time-of-flight experiments.

can be as light as 10^5-10^6 GeV, decays through its small mixings with
right-handed neutrinos creating a lepton asymmetry which is shown to be flavor
dependent. While the doublet vacuum expectation value in {\ovl{16}}_H triggers
the generation of desired mixings, it also induces a large RH triplet vev that
breaks the LR intermediate gauge symmetry and gives large RH neutrino masses.
Manifest unification of gauge couplings and generation of heavy RH neutrino
masses are achieved by renormalizable interactions. The canonical (Type-I)
see-saw contributions to the light neutrino mass matrix cancel out while the
Type-II see-saw contribution is negligible. Determining the parameters of the
dominant inverse see-saw formula using the underlying quark-lepton symmetry and
neutrino oscillation data, we show how leptogenesis under the gravitino
constraint is successfully implemented. New formulas for the decay rate and the
asymmetry parameter are derived leading to baryon asymmetry within the observed
range. The model is found to work for hierarchical as well as inverted
hierarchical light neutrino masses. Testable predictions of the model are RH
doubly charged Higgs bosons which may be leptophilic and accessible to the
Tevatron, LHC or a linear collider. In a model-independent manner, the
Drell-Yan pair production cross section is shown to be bounded between 59%-79%

without SiN buffer layers. The films were fabricated into RF coplanar waveguide
resonators, and internal quality factor measurements were taken at millikelvin
temperatures in both the many photon and single photon limits, i.e. high and
low power regimes, respectively. At high power, internal quality factors
($Q_i$'s) higher than $10^7$ were measured for TiN with predominantly a
(200)-TiN orientation. Films that showed significant (111)-TiN texture
invariably had much lower $Q_i$'s, on the order of $10^5$. Our studies show
that the (200)-TiN is favored for growth at high temperature on either bare Si
or SiN buffer layers. However, growth on bare sapphire or Si(100) at low
temperature resulted in primarily a (111)-TiN orientation. Ellipsometry and
Auger measurements indicate that the (200)-TiN growth on the bare Si substrates
is correlated with the formation of a thin, $\approx 2$ nm, layer of SiN during
the pre-deposition procedure. In the single photon regime, $Q_i$ of these films
exceeded $8\times10^5$, while thicker SiN buffer layers led to reduced $Q_i$'s
at low power.

unstable null orbits. In this paper we develop an expansion method to explore
the link. We obtain new closed-form approximations for the lightly-damped part
of the spectrum in the large-$l$ regime. We confirm that, at leading order in
$l$, the resonance frequency is linked to the orbital frequency, and the
resonance damping to the Lyapunov exponent, of the relevant null orbit. We go
somewhat further than previous studies to establish (i) a spin-dependent
correction to the frequency at order $1 / l$ for equatorial ($m = \pm l$)

macroscopic analogues, due to low inertia. For example, peak speeds >100m/s
have been predicted for carbon nanotube devices. This stimulates our interest
in the atomic-scale physics of friction at high velocity. Here we study a model
nanosystem consisting of a graphene flake moving freely on a graphite substrate
at >100m/s. Using molecular dynamics we discover that ultra-low friction, or
superlubricity, is punctuated by high-friction transients as the flake rotates
through successive crystallographic alignments with the substrate. We term this
phenomenon frictional scattering and show that it is mathematically analogous
to Bragg scattering. We also show that frictional scattering can be eliminated
by using graphitic nanoribbons as frictional waveguides to constrain the flake
rotation, thus achieving persistent superlubricity. Finally, we propose an
experimental method to study nanoscale high-velocity friction. These results
may guide the design of efficient high-frequency nanomechanical devices.

answer depends not only on the scores but also on the membership probabilities
of tuples. Several top-$k$ definitions covering different aspects of
score-probability interplay have been proposed in recent

focused on developing efficient algorithms for answering top-$k$ queries on
static uncertain data. Any change (insertion, deletion of a tuple or change in
membership probability, score of a tuple) in underlying data forces
re-computation of query answers. Such re-computations are not practical
considering the dynamic nature of data in many applications. In this paper, we
propose a fully dynamic data structure that uses ranking function
$PRF^e(\alpha)$ proposed by Li et al.~\cite{R8} under the generally adopted
model of $x$-relations~\cite{R11}. $PRF^e$ can effectively approximate various
other top-$k$ definitions on uncertain data based on the value of parameter
$\alpha$. An $x$-relation consists of a number of $x$-tuples, where $x$-tuple
is a set of mutually exclusive tuples (up to a constant number) called
alternatives. Each $x$-tuple in a relation randomly instantiates into one tuple
from its alternatives. For an uncertain relation with $N$ tuples, our structure
can answer top-$k$ queries in $O(k\log N)$ time, handles an update in $O(\log

evaluation of a software system, based on the standard ISO/IEC-9126. It uses
elements automatically derived from source code enhanced with expert knowledge
in the form of quality characteristic rankings, allowing software engineers to
assign weights to source code attributes. It is flexible in terms of the set of
metrics and source code attributes employed, even in terms of the ISO/IEC-9126
characteristics to be assessed. We applied the methodology to two case studies,
involving five open source and one proprietary system. Results demonstrated
that the methodology can capture software quality trends and express expert
perceptions concerning system quality in a quantitative and systematic manner.

so that no man and woman, who are not married to each other, both prefer each
other. Such a problem has a wide variety of practical applications, ranging
from matching resident doctors to hospitals, to matching students to schools or
more generally to any two-sided market. In the classical stable marriage
problem, both men and women express a strict preference order over the members
of the other sex, in a qualitative way. Here we consider stable marriage
problems with quantitative preferences: each man (resp., woman) provides a
score for each woman (resp., man). Such problems are more expressive than the
classical stable marriage problems. Moreover, in some real-life situations it
is more natural to express scores (to model, for example, profits or costs)
rather than a qualitative preference ordering. In this context, we define new
notions of stability and optimality, and we provide algorithms to find
marriages which are stable and/or optimal according to these notions. While
expressivity greatly increases by adopting quantitative preferences, we show
that in most cases the desired solutions can be found by adapting existing
algorithms for the classical stable marriage problem.

substitutes fully at Fe site in SmFeAsO in an iso-structural lattice with
slightly compressed cell. The parent compound exhibited known spin density wave
(SDW) character below 150K. Successive doping of Co at Fe site suppressed the
SDW transition for x = 0.05 and later induced superconductivity for x = 0.10,
0.15 and 0.20 respectively at 14, 15.5 and 9K. The appearance of bulk
superconductivity is established by wide open isothermal magnetization M(H)
loops. For higher content of Co i.e. x \geq 0.30, superconductivity is not
observed. Clearly the Co substitution at Fe site in SmFe1-xCoxAsO diminishes
the Fe SDW character (x=0.05), introduces bulk superconductivity for x from
0.10 to 0.20 and finally becomes a non-superconductor. The SmCoAsO also
exhibits a secondary AFM like transition at below around 50 K. The reported AFM
ordering of Sm spins is seen from heat capacity Cp(T) at 4.5 K and the same
remains invariant with Co doping in SmFe1-xCoxAsO. Further the FM ordering of
Co-spins (seen in magnetization measurements) is not evident in Cp(T) studies,
suggesting weak correlations between ordered Co-spins in these systems.

vehicles equipped with a variety of sensors used to perform exploration and

computational resources that limit the complexity of on-line planning and

formation, we analyze the shapes of emission lines from hot molecular cores,

forming region SgrB2(M) was observed with Herschel/HIFI (HEXOS key project) in
various lines of HCN and its isotopologues, complemented by APEX data. The
observations are compared to spherically symmetric, centrally heated models
with density power-law gradient and different velocity fields (infall or
infall+expansion), using the radiative transfer code RATRAN. The HCN line
profiles are asymmetric, with the emission peak shifting from blue to red with
increasing J and decreasing line opacity (HCN to H$^{13}$CN). This is most
evident in the HCN 12--11 line at 1062 GHz. These line shapes are reproduced by
a model whose velocity field changes from infall in the outer part to expansion
in the inner part. The qualitative reproduction of the HCN lines suggests that
infall dominates in the colder, outer regions, but expansion dominates in the
warmer, inner regions. We are thus witnessing the onset of feedback in massive
star formation, starting to reverse the infall and finally disrupting the whole
molecular cloud. To obtain our result, the THz lines uniquely covered by HIFI

choose the larger entropy of coefficients to embed watermarks. Unlike most
previous watermarking frameworks which embedded watermarks in the larger
coefficients of inner coarser subbands, the proposed technique is based on
utilizing a context model and fuzzy inference filter by embedding watermarks in
the larger-entropy coefficients of coarser DWT subbands. The proposed
approaches allow us to embed adaptive casting degree of watermarks for
transparency and robustness to the general image-processing attacks such as
smoothing, sharpening, and JPEG compression. The approach has no need the
original host image to extract watermarks. Our schemes have been shown to
provide very good results in both image transparency and robustness.

observations at 8 and 24 $\mu$m were used to compare and study its multi-band

observations reveal that the overall X-ray emission of G344.7-0.1 is extended
and correlates very well with regions of bright radio and infrared emission.
The X-ray spectrum is dominated by prominent atomic emission lines. These
characteristics suggest that the X-ray emission originated in a thin thermal
plasma, whose radiation is represented well by a plane-parallel shock plasma
model (PSHOCK). Our study favors the scenario in which G344.7-0.1 is a 6 x 10^3
year old SNR expanding in a medium with a high density gradient and is most
likely encountering a molecular cloud on the western side. In addition, we
report the discovery of a soft point-like X-ray source located at the
geometrical center of the radio SNR structure. The object presents some
characteristics of the so-called compact central objects (CCO). However, its
neutral hydrogen absorption column (N_{H}) is inconsistent with that of the
SNR. Coincident with the position of the source, we found infrared and optical
objects with typical early-K star characteristics. The X-ray source may be a
foreground star or the CCO associated with the SNR. If this latter possibility
were confirmed, the point-like source would be the farthest CCO detected so far
and the eighth member of the new population of isolated and weakly magnetized
neutron stars.

physical scales. We have selected $1<z<2$ extremely red objects (EROs) and
$1<z<3$ distant red galaxies (DRGs) in SA22 from the near-infrared photometric
data of the UKIDSS Deep eXtragalactic Survey (DXS) and $gri$ optical data from
CTIO covering 3.3~deg$^2$. This is the largest contiguous area studied to
sufficient depth to select these distant galaxies to date. The angular
two-point correlation functions and the real space correlation lengths of each
population are measured and show that both populations are strongly clustered
and that the clustering cannot be parameterised with a single power law. The
correlation function of EROs shows a double power law with the inflection at
$\sim$ 0.6$'$--1.2$'$ (0.6--1.2~h$^{-1}$~Mpc). The bright EROs ($K<18.8$) show
stronger clustering on small scales but similar clustering on larger scales,
whereas redder EROs show stronger clustering on all scales. Clustering
differences between EROs that are old passively evolved galaxies (OGs) and
dusty star-forming galaxies (DGs), on the basis of their $J-K$ colour, are also
investigated. The clustering of $r-K$ EROs are compared with that of $i-K$ EROs
and the differences are consistent with their expected redshift distributions.
The correlation function of DRGs is also well described by a double power law
and consistent with previous studies once the effects of the broader redshift
distribution our selection of DRGs returns are taken into account. We also
perform the same analysis on smaller sub-fields to investigate the impact of
cosmic variance on the derived clustering properties. Currently this study is
the most representative measurement of the clustering of massive galaxies at
$z>1$ on large scales.

giving an energy reward proportional to the intersection time L_t(X,Y)=\int_0^t
\ind_{X_s=Y_s}\dd s: the weight of the path under the new measure is exp(beta

delocalization/localization transition: there is a critical value beta_c, such
that if beta>beta_c the two walks stick together for almost-all Y realizations.
A natural question is that of disorder relevance, that is whether the quenched

the disorder modifies the shape of the free energy curve: (1) We prove that, in
dimension d larger or equal to three 3, the presence of disorder makes the
phase transition at least of second order. This, in dimension larger or equal
to 4, contrasts with the fact that the phase transition of the annealed system
is of first order. (2) In any dimension, we prove that disorder modifies the

the lifetime of the network relies on battery powered nodes. Transmitting at

efficient way of power management is to control the power at which the nodes
transmit. In this paper, a virtual multiple input multiple output wireless
sensor network (VMIMO-WSN)communication architecture is considered and the
power control of sensor nodes based on the approach of game theory is
formulated. The use of game theory has proliferated, with a broad range of
applications in wireless sensor networking. Approaches from game theory can be
used to optimize node level as well as network wide performance. The game here
is categorized as an incomplete information game, in which the nodes do not
have complete information about the strategies taken by other nodes. For
virtual multiple input multiple output wireless sensor network architecture
considered, the Nash equilibrium is used to decide the optimal power level at
which a node needs to transmit, to maximize its utility. Outcome shows that the

At the ESE, transmitters satisfy their minimum QoS incurring in the lowest

more from the scalar case. Disorder in the chemical potential can lead to the

sufficiently strong spin coupling, to Bose glass of singlets between even

odd. Disorder in the scalar Hubbard interaction inhibits Mott insulator regions

accompanied by a dimming of the local coronal emission. From observations of
filament eruptions recorded with the Extreme-Ultraviolet Imager on STEREO
during 2008-2009, it is evident that these dimmings are much more pronounced in
19.5 nm than in the lower-temperature line 17.1 nm, as viewed either on the
disk or above the limb. We conclude that most of the cooler coronal plasma is
not ejected but remains gravitationally bound when the loops open up. This
result is consistent with Doppler measurements by Imada and coworkers, who
found that the upflow speeds in a transient coronal hole increased dramatically
above a temperature of 1 MK; it is also consistent with the quasistatic
behavior of polar plumes, as compared with the hotter interplume regions that
are the main source of the fast solar wind. When the open flux reconnects and
closes down again, the trapped plasma is initially heated to such high
temperatures that it is no longer visible at Fe IX 17.1 nm. Correspondingly,
17.1 nm images show a dark ribbon or ``heat wave'' propagating away from the
polarity inversion line and coinciding with the brightened Fe XV 28.4 nm and Fe
XII 19.5 nm post-eruptive loops and their footpoint areas. Such dark ribbons
provide a clear example of dimmings that are not caused by a density depletion.
The propagation of the ``heat wave'' is driven by the closing-down, not the
opening-up, of flux and can be observed both off-limb and on-disk.

Generation (TCG) is the process of automatically generating a collection of

performed by means of symbolic execution, i.e., instead of executing the
program on normal values (e.g., numbers), the program is executed on symbolic

profiles in the X-ray domain. We investigate the iron line band for two
representative sources -- MCG -6-30-15 (active galaxy) and GX 339-4 (X-ray
binary). We compare two models of the broad iron line, LAOR and KYRLINE. We
realise that the spin is currently determined entirely from the position of the
marginally stable orbit while the effect of the spin on the overall line shape
would be resolvable with higher resolution X-ray missions. We show that the
precision of the spin measurements depends on an unknown angular distribution
of the disc emission. We study how sensitive the spin determination is to the
assumptions about the intrinsic angular distribution of the emitted photons. We
find that the uncertainty of the directional emission distribution translates
to 20% uncertainty in the determination of the radius of marginally stable
orbit. We perform radiation transfer computations of an X-ray irradiated disc
atmosphere (NOAR code) to determine the directionality of outgoing X-rays in
the 2-10 keV energy band. Based on these computations, we find that from the
simple formulae for the directionality, the isotropic case reproduces the
simulated data with the best accuracy. The most frequently used limb-darkening
law favours higher values of spin and, in addition, a steeper radial emissivity

method presented in a previous paper. These models are live N-body models
consisting of equal mass particles, and they are steady state as confirmed by a
fully self-consistent evolution. Our goals were twofold. The first one --
namely to test whether our iterative method could indeed be used to construct
galactic models following given observational constraints, both photometric and
kinematic -- was fully achieved. Our method allowed us to go beyond a simple
spherical model and to make full sets of rotating, axisymmetric models without
any limitations to the velocity distribution. Our second goal was to understand
better the structure of NGC 4494, and more specifically to set constraints on
its halo mass. For this we tried three families of models: without halo, with a
light halo and with a heavy halo, respectively. Our models reproduce well the
photometry and the kinematics, the latter except specific regions where some
non-equilibrium or non-axisymmetric structure could be present in the galaxy
(e.g. the kinematically decoupled core). However, the lower order moments of
the velocity distribution (up to and including the second order) do not allow
us to discriminate between the three halos. On the other hand, when we extend
the comparison to the higher order moments of the velocity distribution
obtained from the long-slit data, we find that our light halo model fits the
data better than the no halo, or the heavy halo models. They also reproduce the
shape of the angular dependence of the PNe velocity dispersion in the outermost
parts of the galaxy, but not the amplitude of its azimuthal variation. This may
imply that a yet more general class of models, such as triaxial, may be
necessary for a yet better fit.

X-ray transient that in 2008 underwent a six month long outburst, starting
(unusually) with an X-ray burst. We detected a total of 57 thermonuclear bursts
throughout the outburst with AGILE, Swift, RXTE, and INTEGRAL. The wide range
of inferred accretion rates (between <1% and about 20% of the Eddington
accretion rate m-dot_Edd) spanned during the outburst allows us to study
changes in the nuclear burning processes and to identify up to seven different
phases. The burst rate increased gradually with the accretion rate until it
dropped (at a persistent flux corresponding to about 15% of m-dot_Edd) a few
days before the outburst peak, after which bursts were not detected for a
month. As the persistent emission subsequently decreased, the bursting activity
resumed with a much lower rate than during the outburst rise. This hysteresis
may arise from the thermal effect of the accretion on the surface nuclear
burning processes, and the timescale is roughly consistent with that expected
for the neutron star crust thermal response. On the other hand, an undetected
superburst, occurring within a data gap near the outburst peak, could have
produced a similar quenching of burst activity.

cm of two radio galaxies located in A401 and Ophiuchus, a radio galaxy in
A2142, and a radio galaxy located in the background of A2065. All these galaxy
clusters are characterized by high temperatures. We obtained detailed RM images
at an angular resolution of 3'' for most of the observed radio galaxies. The RM
images are patchy and reveal fine substructures of a few kpc in size. Under the
assumption that the radio galaxies themselves have no effect on the measured
RMs, these structures indicate that the intracluster magnetic fields fluctuate
down to such small scales. These new data are compared with RM information
present in the literature for cooler galaxy clusters. For a fixed projected
distance from the cluster center, clusters with higher temperature show a
higher dispersion of the RM distributions (sigmaRM), mostly because of the
higher gas density in these clusters. Although the previously known relation
between the clusters X-ray surface brightness (Sx) at the radio galaxy location
and sigmaRM is confirmed, a possible connection between the sigmaRM-Sx relation
and the cluster temperature, if present, is very weak. Therefore, in view of
the current data, it is impossible to establish a strict link between the
magnetic field strength and the gas temperature of the intracluster medium.

is more constrained due to anomaly cancelation conditions, imposing unification
of gauge couplings in the second setup generates conditions which precisely
match the mixed anomaly constraints in the FN setup. Finally, we provide an

activation energy of (2.15 +/- 0.04) eV. To interpret the TRR measurements the
refractive indices of the a-Ge layers were measured at the two wavelengths
used, 1.152 and 1.532 {\mu}m. For the first time, SPE rate measurements on
thick a-Ge layers (>3 {\mu}m) have also been performed to distinguish between
bulk and near-surface SPE growth rate behavior. Possible effects of explosive
crystallization on thick a-Ge layers are considered. When H is present in a-Ge
it is found to have a considerably greater retarding affect on the SPE rate
than for similar concentrations in a-Si layers. Hydrogen is found to reduce the
pre-exponential SPE velocity factor but not the activation energy of SPE.
However, the extent of H indiffusion into a-Ge surface layers during SPE is
about one order of magnitude less that that observed for a-Si layers. This is
thought to be due to the lack of a stable surface oxide on a-Ge. Dopant
enhanced kinetics were measured in a-Ge layers containing uniform concentration
profiles of implanted As or Al spanning the concentration regime 1-10 x1019

""inference"" problems in graphical models, such as Bayesian networks and Markov
random fields. The system-state probability distribution of CSMA wireless
networks is a Markov random field. An interesting question is how BP can help
the analysis and design of CSMA wireless networks. This paper explores three
such applications. First, we show how BP can be used to compute the throughputs
of different links in the network given their access intensities, defined as
the mean packet transmission time divided by the mean backoff countdown time.
Second, we propose an inverse-BP algorithm to solve the reverse problem: how to
set the access intensities of different links to meet their target throughputs?
Third, we introduce a BP-adaptive CSMA algorithm to find the link access
intensities that can achieve optimal system utility. BP solves the three
problems with exact results in tree networks. It may, however, lose accuracy in
networks with a loopy contention graph. We show how a generalized version of
BP, GBP, can be designed to solve the three problems with high accuracy for
networks with a loopy contention graph. Importantly, we show how the BP and GBP
algorithms in this paper can be implemented in a distributed manner, making
them useful in practical CSMA network opera-tion.

luminosity of about $10^{32}$cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$, DA$\Phi$NE upgraded in energy
can perform a scan in the region from 1 to 2.5 GeV in one year by collecting an
integrated luminosity of 20 pb$^{-1}$ (corresponding to a few days of data
taking) for single point, assuming an energy step of 25 MeV. A few years of
data taking in this region would provide important tests of QCD and effective

the $\eta'$), scalar ($f_0,f'_0$, etc...) and axial-vector ($a_1$, etc...)

We determine an orthogonal family of strictly bandlimited functions that are

of strictly spacelimited functions that are optimally concentrated in the
Fourier domain. The Cartesian Slepian functions can be found by solving a
Fredholm integral equation whose associated eigenvalues are a measure of the

practical applications of signal representation or spectral analysis such as
exist in geophysics or astronomy, in physical space irregular shapes, and in
spectral space symmetric domains will usually be preferred. When the
concentration domains are circularly symmetric in both spaces, the Slepian

special algorithms for this case, as is well known. Much like their
one-dimensional and spherical counterparts with which we discuss them in a

has been used to obtain multi-band images of the nearby spiral galaxy M83.
These new observations are the deepest and highest resolution images ever taken
of a grand-design spiral, particularly in the near ultraviolet, and allow us to
better differentiate compact star clusters from individual stars and to measure
the luminosities of even faint clusters in the U band. We find that the
luminosity function for clusters outside of the very crowded starburst nucleus
can be approximated by a power law, dN/dL \propto L^{alpha}, with alpha = -2.04
+/- 0.08, down to M_V ~ -5.5. We test the sensitivity of the luminosity
function to different selection techniques, filters, binning, and aperture
correction determinations, and find that none of these contribute significantly
to uncertainties in alpha. We estimate ages and masses for the clusters by
comparing their measured UBVI,Halpha colors with predictions from single
stellar population models. The age distribution of the clusters can be
approximated by a power-law, dN/dt propto t^{gamma}, with gamma=-0.9 +/- 0.2,
for M > few x 10^3 Msun and t < 4x10^8 yr. This indicates that clusters are
disrupted quickly, with ~80-90% disrupted each decade in age over this time.
The mass function of clusters over the same M-t range is a power law, dN/dM
propto M^{beta}, with beta=-1.94 +/- 0.16, and does not have bends or show
curvature at either high or low masses. Therefore, we do not find evidence for
a physical upper mass limit, M_C, or for the earlier disruption of lower mass
clusters when compared with higher mass clusters, i.e. mass-dependent
disruption. We briefly discuss these implications for the formation and
disruption of the clusters.

was proposed recently to schedule any strictly feasible achievable rates inside
the capacity region. Of particular interest is the fact that the adaptive CSMA
can achieve a system utility arbitrarily close to that is achievable under a
central scheduler. However, a specially designed transport-layer rate
controller is needed for this result. An outstanding question is whether the
widely-installed TCP Reno is compatible with adaptive CSMA and can achieve the
same result. The answer to this question will determine how close to practical
deployment adaptive CSMA is. Our answer is yes and no. First, we observe that
running TCP Reno directly over adaptive CSMA results in severe starvation
problems. Effectively, its performance is no better than that of TCP Reno over
legacy CSMA (IEEE 802.11), and the potentials of adaptive CSMA cannot be
realized. Fortunately, we find that multi-connection TCP Reno over adaptive
CSMA with active queue management can materialize the advantages of adaptive
CSMA. NS-2 simulations demonstrate that our solution can alleviate starvation
and achieve fair and efficient rate allocation. Multi-connection TCP can be
implemented at either application or transport layer. Application-layer
implementation requires no kernel modification, making the solution readily
deployable in networks running adaptive CSMA.

have been shown some time ago to possess remarkable algebraic structures. The
set (""dynamical spectrum"") of propagating $p$-forms has been described as a
(truncation of a) real Borcherds superalgebra $\mf{V}_D$ that is characterized
concisely by a Cartan matrix which has been constructed explicitly for each
spacetime dimension $11 \geq D \geq 3.$ In the equations of motion, each
differential form of degree $p$ is the coefficient of a (super-) group
generator, which is itself of degree $p$ for a specific gradation (the
$\mf{V}$-gradation). A slightly milder truncation of the Borcherds superalgebra
enables one to predict also the ""spectrum"" of the non-dynamical $(D - 1)$ and
$D$-forms. The maximal supergravity $p$-form spectra were reanalyzed more
recently by truncation of the field spectrum of $E_{11}$ to the $p$-forms that
are relevant after reduction from 11 to $D$ dimensions. We show in this paper
how the Borcherds description can be systematically derived from the split
(""maximally non compact"") real form of $E_{11}$ for $D \geq 1.$ This explains
not only why both structures lead to the same propagating $p$-forms and their
duals for $p\leq (D - 2),$ but also why one obtains the same $(D - 1)$-forms

reddened classical T Tau stars; however, when comparing to the thick disk SEDs

For sufficiently large (positive) non-additivity the mixture phase separates
into two fluid phases with different compositions. We calculate bulk
fluid-fluid coexistence curves for a range of size ratios and non-additivity
parameters and find that they compare well to simulation results from the
literature. Using the Ornstein-Zernike equation, we investigate the asymptotic,
r->infinity, decay of the partial pair correlation functions, g_ij(r). At low
densities there occurs a structural crossover in the asymptotic decay between
two different damped oscillatory modes with different wavelengths corresponding
to the two intra-species hard core diameters. On approaching the fluid-fluid
critical point there is Fisher-Widom crossover from exponentially damped
oscillatory to monotonic asymptotic decay. Using the density functional we
calculate the density profiles for the planar free fluid-fluid interface
between coexisting fluid phases. We show that the type of asymptotic decay of
g_ij(r) not only determines the asymptotic decay of the interface profiles, but
is also relevant for intermediate and even short-ranged behaviour. We also
determine the surface tension of the free fluid interface, finding that it
increases with non-additivity, and that on approaching the critical point
mean-field scaling holds.

hopping can potentially give rise to unusual paired states in {\it unpolarized}
mixtures that can behave as non-Fermi liquids. One possibility is a fully
paired state with a gap for fermion excitations in which the Cooper pairs
remain uncondensed. Such a ""Cooper-pair Bose-metal"" phase would be expected to
have a singular Bose-surface in momentum space. As demonstrated in the context
of 2D bosons hopping with a frustrating ring-exchange interaction, an analogous
Bose-metal phase has a set of quasi-1D descendent states when put on a ladder
geometry. Here we present a density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) study
of the attractive Hubbard model with spin-dependent hopping on a two-leg ladder
geometry. In our setup, one spin species moves preferentially along the leg
direction, while the other does so along the rung direction. We find compelling
evidence for the existence of a novel Cooper-pair Bose-metal phase in a region
of the phase diagram at intermediate coupling. We further explore the phase
diagram of this model as a function of hopping anisotropy, density, and
interaction strength, finding a conventional superfluid phase, as well as a
phase of paired Cooper pairs with d-wave symmetry, similar to the one found in
models of hard-core bosons with ring-exchange. We argue that simulating this

substrate coupling. Generally, the phonon scattering with substrates can
decrease the thermal conductivity, as observed in recent experiments. However,
we find that at certain regions, the coupling to substrates can increase the
thermal conductivity due to a reduction of anharmonic phonon scattering induced
by shift of the phonon band to the low wave vector. In this way, the thermal
conductivity can be efficiently manipulated via coupling to different
substrates, without changing or destroying the material structures. This idea
is demonstrated by calculating the thermal conductivity of modified
double-walled carbon nanotubes and also by the ice nanotubes coupled within
carbon nanotubes.
