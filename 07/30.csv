electrode. The junctions show RSJ-like current-voltage characteristics up to
the critical temperature of the counter electrode of about 7.2K. The
temperature dependence of the critical current, IC, does not show an
Ambegaokar-Baratoff behavior. Well-pronounced Shapiro steps are observed at

CSMA MAC protocol. In this MAC, a node carrier-senses multiple frequency
channels simultaneously, and it takes the first opportunity to transmit on any
one of the channels when allowed by the CSMA backoff mechanism. We show that
the frequency-agile MAC can effectively 1) boost throughput and 2) remove
temporal starvation. Furthermore, the MAC can be implemented on the existing
multiple-frequency setup in Wi-Fi using multi-radio technology, and it can
co-exist with the legacy MAC using single radio. This paper provides exact
stationary throughput analysis for regular 1D and thin-strip 2D CSMA networks
using a ""transfer-matrix"" approach. In addition, accurate approximations are
given for 2D grid networks. Our closed-form formulas accurately quantify the
throughput gain of frequency-agile CSMA. To characterize temporal starvation,
we use the metric of ""mean residual access time"" (MRAT). Our simulations and
closed-form approximations indicate that the frequency-agile MAC can totally
eliminate temporal starvation in 2D grid networks, reducing its MRAT by orders
of magnitude. Finally, this paper presents a ""coloring theorem"" to justify the
use of the frequency-agile MAC in general network topologies. Our analysis and
theorem suggest that with enough frequency channels, the frequency-agile MAC
can effectively decouple the detrimental interactions between neighboring links
responsible for low throughput and starvation.

southern sky made with data at a frequency of 148 GHz from the Atacama
Cosmology Telescope 2008 observing season. We provide a catalog of 157 sources
with flux densities spanning two orders of magnitude: from 15 to 1500 mJy.
Comparison to other catalogs shows that 98% of the ACT detections correspond to
sources detected at lower radio frequencies. Three of the sources appear to be
associated with the brightest cluster galaxies of low redshift X-ray selected
galaxy clusters. Estimates of the radio to mm-wave spectral indices and
differential counts of the sources further bolster the hypothesis that they are
nearly all radio sources, and that their emission is not dominated by
re-emission from warm dust. In a bright (>50 mJy) 148 GHz-selected sample with
complete cross-identifications from the Australia Telescope 20 GHz survey, we
observe an average steepening of the spectra between 5, 20, and 148 GHz with
median spectral indices of $\alpha_{\rm 5-20} = -0.07 \pm 0.06$, $\alpha_{\rm
20-148} = -0.39 \pm0.04$, and $\alpha_{\rm 5-148} = -0.20 \pm 0.03$. When the
measured spectral indices are taken into account, the 148 GHz differential
source counts are consistent with previous measurements at 30 GHz in the

an appropriately rescaled model for the radio source counts, the Poisson

Prior work shows that there is selection against ""unconditional"" dispersal in

disperse at a rate independent of their location. We prove that if within-patch
fitness varies spatially and between two values temporally, then there is
selection for unconditional dispersal: any evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS)
or evolutionarily stable coalition (ESC) includes a dispersive phenotype.
Moreover, at this ESS or ESC, there is at least one sink patch (i.e. geometric
mean of fitness less than one) and no sources patches (i.e. geometric mean of
fitness greater than one). These results coupled with simulations suggest that
spatial-temporal heterogeneity due to abiotic forcing result in either an ESS
with a dispersive phenotype or an ESC with sedentary and dispersive phenotypes.
In contrast, spatial-temporal heterogeneity due to biotic interactions can
select for higher dispersal rates that ultimately spatially synchronize
population dynamics.

universe that allows for an extension of the geodesic equations of motion. In
this paper, we will study a specific class of such extensions, and show that
contrary to expectations, they are not automatically ruled out by either
theoretical considerations or experimental constraints. In particular, we show
that while these extensions affect the motion of massive particles, the motion
of massless particles are not changed; such phenomena as gravitational lensing
remain unchanged. We also show that these extensions do not violate the
equivalence principal, and that because $\ell_{DE}=14010^{800}_{820}$ Mpc, a
specific choice of this extension can be made so that effects of this extension
are not be measurable either from terrestrial experiments, or through
observations of the motion of solar system bodies. A lower bound for the only
parameter used in this extension is set.

processes $\pi^-\gamma \to \pi^- \pi^0\pi^0$ and $\pi^-\gamma\to

by the chiral pion-pion interaction. The next-to-leading order corrections
arise from pion-loop diagrams and chiral-invariant counterterms involving the

$1.5 - 1.8$ by the next-to-leading order corrections. In contrast to this

$\pi^-\gamma\to \pi^+ \pi^-\pi^-$ remains almost unchanged in the region
$\sqrt{s}< 6m_\pi$ in comparison to its tree-level result. Although the

the complete set of two-pion invariant mass spectra. The predictions of chiral

dramatic differences between that group and the subluminous and SN 2002cx-like

more homogeneity than do the bluer UV filters ($uvm2$, $uvw2$). Searching for

find the peak width to be a poor discriminant, but we do see a variation in the
time delay between peak emission and the late, flat phase of the light curves.
The UV light curves peak a few days before the $B$ band for most subclasses (as
was previously reported by Jha et al. 2006a), although the SN 2002cx-like
objects peak at a very early epoch in the UV. That group also features the

quasienergy approach by switching to a frame rotating with the external
modulation frequency and by using the dressed atom picture. A quasienergy
surface in phase space emerges whose level spacing is governed by a rescaled
effective Planck constant. Moreover, the well-known multiphoton transitions can
be reinterpreted as resonant tunneling transitions from the local maximum of
the quasienergy surface. Most importantly, the driving defines a quasienergy
well which is nonperturbative in nature. The quantum mechanical quasienergy
state localized at its bottom is squeezed. In the Purcell limited regime, the
potential well is metastable and the effective local temperature close to its
minimum is uniquely determined by the squeezing factor. The activation occurs
in this case via dressed spin flip transitions rather than via quantum
activation as in other driven nonlinear quantum systems such as the quantum
Duffing oscillator. The local maximum is in general stable. However, in
presence of resonant coherent or dissipative tunneling transitions the system
can escape from it and a stationary state arises as a statistical mixture of
quasienergy states being localized in the two basins of attraction. This gives
rise to a resonant or an antiresonant nonlinear response of the cavity at
multiphoton transitions. The model finds direct application in recent
experiments with a driven superconducting circuit QED setup.

that in both cases the upper bounds on the above EDMs do not forbid sizable
non-standard CPV effects in B_s mixing. However, if a large CPV phase in B_s
mixing will be confirmed, this will imply EDMs very close to their present
experimental bounds, within the reach of the next generation of experiments, as
well as BR(B_{s,d}-> mu^+ mu^-) typically largely enhanced over its SM
expectation. The two flavour-blind CPV mechanisms can be distinguished through
the correlation between S_psi K_S and S_psi phi that is strikingly different if
only one of them is relevant. Which of these two CPV mechanisms dominates
depends on the precise values of S_psi phi and S_psi K_S, as well as on the CKM
phase (as determined by tree-level processes). Current data seems to show a
mild preference for a hybrid scenario where both these mechanisms are at work.

With the latest infrared surveys, the number of massive protostellar
candidates has increased significantly. New studies have posed additional
questions on important issues about the formation, evolution, and other

are a good tool to study the nature of these objects, and to diagnose the
formation stage. Aims. Here we study the far-infrared source IRAS 16353-4636
with the aim of understanding its nature and origin. In particular, we search
for young stellar objects (YSOs), possible outflow structure, and the presence
of non-thermal emission. Methods. Using high-resolution, multi-wavelength radio
continuum data obtained with the Australia Telescope Compact Array, we image
IRAS 16353-4636 and its environment from 1.4 to 19.6 GHz, and derive the
distribution of the spectral index at maximum angular resolution. We also
present new JHKs photometry and spectroscopy data obtained at ESO NTT. 13 CO
and archival HI line data, and infrared databases (MSX, GLIMPSE, MIPSGal) are
also inspected. Results. The radio continuum emission associated with IRAS
16353-4636 was found to be extended (~10 arcsec), with a bow-shaped morphology
above 4.8 GHz, and a strong peak persistent at all frequencies. The NIR
photometry led us to identify ten near-IR sources and classify them according
to their color. We used the HI line data to derive the source distance, and
analyzed the kinematical information from the CO and NIR lines detected.
Conclusions. We have identified the source IRAS 16353-4636 as a new
protostellar cluster. In this cluster we recognized three distinct sources: a
low-mass YSO, a high-mass YSOs, and a mildly confined region of intense and
non-thermal radio emission. We propose the latter corresponds to the terminal
part of an outflow.

~3.1. We apply flare loop hydrodynamic modeling to the plasma parameter
temporal changes to derive a loop semi-length of l/Rstar =0.37 +/-0.07. The
soft X-ray spectrum of the flare reveals evidence of iron Kalpha emission at
6.4 keV. We model the Kalpha emission as fluorescence from the hot flare source
irradiating the photospheric iron, and derive loop heights of h/Rstar=0.1,
consistent within factors of a few with the heights inferred from hydrodynamic
modeling. The Kalpha emission feature shows variability on time scales of ~200
s which is difficult to interpret using the pure fluorescence hypothesis. We
examine Kalpha emission produced by collisional ionization from accelerated
particles, and find parameter values for the spectrum of accelerated particles
which can accommodate the increased amount of Kalpha flux and the lack of

but detectable metallicity spread. This spread is compatible with the presence
of two different groups of stars with a metallicity difference of 0.06-0.08
dex, in agreement with earlier photometric studies. If stars are divided into
these two groups according to their metallicity, both components show a Na-O
anticorrelation (signature of a genuine GC nature) of moderate extension. The
metal-poor stars are more concentrated than the metal-rich ones. We tentatively
propose the hypothesis that NGC 1851 formed from a merger of two individual GCs
with a slightly different Fe and alpha-element content, and possibly an age
difference up to 1 Gyr. This is supported also by number ratios of stars on the
split subgiant and on the bimodal horizontal branches. The distribution of
n-capture process elements in the two components also supports the idea that
the enrichment must have occurred in each of the structures separately, and not
as a continuum of events in a single GC. The most probable explanation is that
the proto-clusters formed into a (now dissolved) dwarf galaxy and later merged
to produce the present GC.

an undocumented timing offset of -25.6 ms between the spacecraft attitude and
radio flux density timestamps. If the offset induced an error during
calibration of the raw TOD, then estimates of the WMAP CMB quadrupole might be
substantially in error. A timing error during calibration would not only induce
an artificial quadrupole-like signal in the mean sky map, it would also add
variance per pixel. This variance would be present in the calibrated TOD.
Low-resolution map-making as a function of timing offset should show a minimum
variance for the correct timing offset. Three years of the calibrated, filtered
WMAP 3-year TOD are compiled into sky maps at HEALPix resolution N_side=8,
individually for each of the K, Ka, Q, V and W band differencing assemblies
(DA's), as a function of timing offset. The median per map of the temperature
fluctuation variance per pixel is calculated and minimised against timing
offset. Minima are clearly present. The timing offsets that minimise the median
variance are -38 \pm 8 ms (K, Ka), -27 \pm 3 ms (Q), -43 \pm 8 ms (V), and -47
\pm 194 ms (W), i.e. an average of -30 \pm 3 ms, where the WMAP collaboration's
preferred offset is 0 \pm 1.7 ms. A non-parametric bootstrap analysis rejects
the latter at a significance of 99.999%. The hypothesis of a -25.6 ms offset,
suggested by Liu, Xiong & Li from the TOD file timing offset, is consistent
with these minima. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the WMAP
calibrated TOD and inferred maps are wrongly calibrated. CMB quadrupole
estimates (3/pi)C_2 based on the incorrectly calibrated TOD are overestimated

by almost 40% while operating in the regime $nd^2 << 1$. In this paper we argue
that at $nd^2 << 1$ correlations between the electronic charge of opposite
electrodes become important. We develop a theory of the capacitance for the
full range of $nd^2$. We show that, in the absence of disorder, the capacitance
can be $4d/a$ times larger than the geometric value, where $a << d$ is the
electron Bohr radius. Our results compare favorably with the experiment of Ref.
[1] without the use of adjustable parameters.

plasma waves are induced by an unstable electron beam is reduced by background
density fluctuations, most acutely when fluctuations have large amplitudes or
small wavelengths. This suppression of plasma waves alters the wave
distribution which changes the electron beam transport. Assuming a 5/3
Kolmogorov-type power density spectrum of fluctuations often observed near the
Earth, we investigate the corresponding energy spectrum of the electron beam
after it has propagated 1 AU. We find a direct correlation between the spectrum
of the double power-law below the break energy and the turbulent intensity of
the background plasma. For an initial spectral index of 3.5, we find a range of

eight orders of magnitude in luminosity by transforming standard fundamental
plane parameters into a space of mass (M1/2), radius (r1/2), and luminosity
(L1/2). We find that from ultra-faint dwarf spheroidals to giant cluster
spheroids, dispersion-supported galaxies scatter about a one-dimensional
""fundamental curve"" through this MRL space. The weakness of the M1/2-L1/2 slope
on the faint end may imply that potential well depth limits galaxy formation in
small galaxies, while the stronger dependence on L1/2 on the bright end
suggests that baryonic physics limits galaxy formation in massive galaxies. The
mass-radius projection of this curve can be compared to median dark matter halo
mass profiles of LCDM halos in order to construct a virial mass-luminosity
relationship (Mvir-L) for galaxies that spans seven orders of magnitude in
Mvir. Independent of any global abundance or clustering information, we find
that (spheroidal) galaxy formation needs to be most efficient in halos of Mvir
~ 10^12 Msun and to become inefficient above and below this scale. Moreover,
this profile matching technique is most accurate at the high and low luminosity
extremes (where dark matter fractions are highest) and is therefore quite
complementary to statistical approaches that rely on having a well-sampled
luminosity function. We also consider the significance and utility of the
scatter about this relation, and find that in the dSph regime observational
errors are almost at the point where we can explore the intrinsic scatter in
the luminosity-virial mass relation. Finally, we note that purely stellar
systems like Globular Clusters and Ultra Compact Dwarfs do not follow the
fundamental curve relation. This allows them to be easily distinguished from
dark-matter dominated dSph galaxies in MRL space. (abridged)

sign-reversed s^{\pm} superconducting state in the iron pnictides. In the
magnetic scenario, whether the spin fluctuation spectrum exhibits certain
unique fine structures is an interesting aspect for theoretical study in order
to understand experimental observations. We investigate the detailed momentum
dependence of the short-range spin fluctuations using a 2-orbital model in the
self-consistent fluctuation exchange approximation and find that a common
feature of those fluctuations that are capable of inducing a fully gapped
s^{\pm} state is the momentum anisotropy with lengthened span along the
direction transverse to the antiferromagnetic momentum transfer. Performing a
qualitative analysis based on the orbital character and the deviation from
perfect nesting of the electronic structure for the 2-orbital and a more
complete 5-orbital model, we gain the insight that this type of anisotropic
spin fluctuations favor superconductivity due to their enhancement of
intra-orbital, but inter-band, pair scattering processes. The momentum
anisotropy leads to elliptically shaped magnetic responses which have been
observed in inelastic neutron scattering measurements. Meanwhile, our detailed
study on the magnetic and the electronic spectrum shows that the dispersion of
the magnetic resonance mode in the nearly isotropic s^{\pm} superconducting
state exhibits anisotropic propagating behavior in an upward pattern and the
coupling of the resonance mode to fermions leads to a dip feature in the
spectral function.

ellipticals, we find that all circular velocity curves are rising in the outer
parts due to a combination of a rising temperature profile and a logarithmic
pressure gradient that increases in magnitude. Comparing the circular velocity
curves we obtain from X-rays to those obtained from dynamical models, we find
that the former are often lower in the central ~10 kpc. This is probably due to
a combination of: i) Non-thermal contributions of up to ~35% in the pressure
(with stronger effects in NGC 4486), ii) multiple-temperature components in the
hot gas, iii) incomplete kinematic spatial coverage in the dynamical models,
and iv) mass profiles that are insufficiently general in the dynamical
modelling. Complementing the total mass information from the X-rays with
photometry and stellar population models to infer the dark matter content, we
find evidence for massive dark matter haloes with dark matter mass fractions of
~35-80% at 2Re, rising to a maximum of 80-90% at the outermost radii. We also
find that the six galaxies follow a Tully-Fisher relation with slope ~4 and
that their circular velocities at 1Re correlate strongly with the velocity
dispersion of the local environment. As a result, the galaxy luminosity at 1Re
also correlates with the velocity dispersion of the environment. These

together loosely by hydrophobic interactions into a spherical hydrophobic core.
We assume that fibrillar amyloid chains are aligned and further stabilized by
`steric zipper' interactions -- hydrogen bonding and steric packing, in
addition to specific hydrophobic sidechain contacts. The model makes a broad
set of predictions, consistent with experiments: (i) Similar to surfactant
micellization, amyloid oligomerization should increase with bulk peptide
concentration. (ii) The onset of fibrillization limits the concentration of
oligomers in the solution. (iii) The average fibril length \emph{vs.} monomer
concentration agrees with data on $\alpha$-synuclein, (iv) Full fibril length
distributions follow those of $\alpha$-synuclein, (v) Denaturants should `melt
out' fibrils, and (vi) Added salt should stabilize fibrils by reducing
repulsions between amyloid peptide chains. Interestingly, small changes in
solvent conditions can: (a) tip the equilibrium balance between oligomer and
fibril, and (b) cause large changes in rates, through effects on the

construction is that the power consumption of accelerators will become much
smaller. This raises the old possibility of using high energy protons to make
neutrons which are then absorbed by fertile uranium or thorium to make a
fissionable material like plutonium that can be burned in a nuclear reactor.
The Energy Doubler/Saver being constructed at Fermilab is to be a
superconducting accelerator that will produce 1000 GeV protons. The expected
intensity of about $10^{12}$ protons per second corresponds to a beam power of
about 0.2 MW. The total power requirements of the Doubler will be about 20 MW
of which the injector complex will use approximately 13 MW, and the
refrigeration of the superconducting magnets will use about 7 MW. Thus the beam
power as projected is only a few orders of magnitude less than the accelerator
power. But each 1000 GeV proton will produce about 60,000 neutrons in each
nuclear cascade shower that is releaseq in a block of uranium, and then most of
these neutrons will be absorbed to produce 60,000 plutonium a toms. Each of
these when burned will Subsequently release about 0.2 GeV of fission energy to
make a total energy of 12,000 GeV (20 ergs) for each 1000 GeV proton. Inasmuch
as megawatts are involved, it appears to be worthwhile to consider the cost of
making the protons to see if there could be an overall energy production.

state of Cooper pairs with charge 2e, and this is equally true of the Josephson
effect. In contrast, Kadin recently presented an alternative real-space model
of the superconducting ground state, in which each electron is a localized
orbital, on the scale of the coherence length, coupled to a dynamic charge (or
spin) density wave. A supercurrent corresponds to collective motion of a dense
orthogonal array of such electrons. The present paper extends this analysis to
two weakly coupled superconductors, and shows how the Josephson effect
(including the ubiquitous factor of h/2e) may be obtained. Furthermore, much of
the standard BCS formalism on the macroscale follows from this microstructure.
However, major deviations from standard Josephson behavior are predicted for
nanoscale SQUIDs much smaller than the coherence length.

User-Centric Service (UCS) creation is expected to explode following a similar
success path to User-Generated Content. One of the major challenges in this
emerging highly user-centric networking paradigm is how to make these exploding
in numbers yet, individually, of vanishing demand services available in a
cost-effective manner. Of prime importance to the latter (and focus of this
paper) is the determination of the optimal location for hosting a UCS. Taking
into account the particular characteristics of UCS, we formulate the problem as
a facility location problem and devise a distributed and highly scalable
heuristic solution to it.
  Key to the proposed approach is the introduction of a novel metric drawing on
Complex Network Analysis. Given a current location of UCS, this metric helps to
a) identify a small subgraph of nodes with high capacity to act as service
demand concentrators; b) project on them a reduced yet accurate view of the
global demand distribution that preserves the key attraction forces on UCS;
and, ultimately, c) pave the service migration path towards its optimal
location in the network. The proposed iterative UCS migration algorithm, called
cDSMA, is extensively evaluated over synthetic and real-world network
topologies. Our results show that cDSMA achieves high accuracy, fast
convergence, remarkable insensitivity to the size and diameter of the network
and resilience to inaccurate estimates of demands for UCS across the network.
It is also shown to clearly outperform local-search heuristics for service
migration that constrain the subgraph to the immediate neighbourhood of the
node currently hosting UCS.

  introduction and some references added",,,,"gr-qc hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work we describe a black hole, set on a non-commutative background.
The model, which is relatively simple, is an exact solution of the Einstein
Field Equations. Based on a proposition we put forward, we argue that
introducing a matter density field on a non-commutative background sets up a
mechanism that deforms the field into two distinct fields, one residing
dominantly on the lattice tops (hereafter, on-cell) and the other residing
dominantly in the inter-lattice regions (hereafter, off-cell). The two fields
have different physical and themodynamic characterics which we describe, and
some of which play a role in halting collpse to a singularity. For example, not
surprisingly the on-cell (off-cell) fields manifest standard on-shell
(off-shell) characteristics, respectively. Both the density and the net
mass-energy are unchanged by the deformation mechanism. In our treatment the
mass of a black hole defines its own size scale L of the interior region it
occupies. Moreover, such a length is quantized, L=2N\sqrt{\theta}, in terms of
a minimum length scale \sqrt{\theta}. The approach has the advantage that there
is no degeneracy in mass-confinement since, here, the black hole density is not
a function of the mass (as is the case in some recent treatments). The density
is, instead a fixed quantity. As such, the approach puts an upper bound on
black hole density, making it a universal parameter. The picture that emerges
is that a black hole defined on a non-commutative background is both
non-singular, holographic and quantized. Yet we also find, interestingly, that
when taken over L the average value of the associated energy-stress tensor of
the fields satisfies all classical energy conditions of GR.

interactions. We find that the chief electrostatic free energy cost of forming
assemblies comes from the entropic loss of counterions that render assemblies
charge-neutral. Because there exists more accessible volume for these
counterions around an open gel than a dense crystal, there exists an
electrostatic entropic driving force favoring the gel over the crystal. This
driving force increases with increasing sphere charge, but can be counteracted
by increasing counterion concentration. We show that these effects cannot be
fully captured by pairwise-additive macroion interactions of the kind often
used in simulations, and we show where on the phase diagram to go in order to
suppress gel formation.

dimensional slab models, thus allowing for photoionization by O stars of low
altitude neutral clouds in the Galaxy that are also detected in Halpha. In
previous studies of such clouds the photoionization scenario had been rejected
and the Halpha had been attributed to enhanced cosmic ray ionization or
scattered light from midplane H II regions. We do find that the emission
measure distributions in our simulations are wider than those derived from
Halpha observations in the Milky Way. In addition, the horizontally averaged
height dependence of the gas density in the hydrodynamical models is lower than
inferred in the Galaxy. These discrepancies are likely due to the absence of
magnetic fields in the hydrodynamic simulations and we discuss how
magnetohydrodynamic effects may reconcile models and observations.
Nevertheless, we anticipate that the inclusion of magnetic fields in the
dynamical simulations will not alter our primary finding that midplane OB stars
are capable of producing high altitude diffuse ionized gas in a realistic
three-dimensional interstellar medium.

that this is likely to be driven by the formation of a dynamical charge density
wave. However, Tl2Mo6Se6 and In2Mo6Se6 remain metallic down to low temperature,
with superconducting transitions at Tc = 4.2K and 2.85K respectively. The
absence of any metal-insulator transition in these materials is due to a larger
in-plane bandwidth, leading to increased inter-chain hopping which suppresses
the density wave instability. Electronic heat capacity data for the
superconducting compounds reveal an exceptionally low density of states DEF =

of Einstein modes, we obtain the approximate phonon density of states F(w).
Deconvolving the resistivity for the two superconductors then yields their
electron-phonon transport coupling function a^2F(w). In Tl2Mo6Se6 and
In2Mo6Se6, F(w) is dominated by an optical ""guest ion"" mode at ~5meV and a set
of acoustic modes from ~10-30meV. Rb2Mo6Se6 exhibits a similar spectrum;
however, the optical phonon has a lower intensity and is shifted to ~8meV.
Electrons in Tl2Mo6Se6 couple strongly to both sets of modes, whereas In2Mo6Se6
only displays significant coupling in the 10-18meV range. Although pairing is
clearly not mediated by the guest ion phonon, we believe it has a beneficial
effect on superconductivity in Tl2Mo6Se6, given its extraordinarily large
coupling strength and higher Tc compared to In2Mo6Se6.

expected to contain residual signatures of the first stars in the early
universe. Numerous studies attempt to explain the intrinsic abundance scatter
observed in some metal-poor populations in terms of chemical inhomogeneities
dispersed throughout the early Galactic medium due to discrete enrichment
events. Just how the complex data and models are to be interpreted with respect
to ""progenitor yields"" remains an open question. Here we show that stochastic
chemical evolution models to date have overlooked a crucial fact. Essentially
all stars today are born in highly homogeneous star clusters and it is likely
that this was also true at early times. When this ingredient is included, the
overall scatter in the abundance plane [Fe/H] vs. [X/Fe] (C-space), where X is
a nucleosynthetic element, can be much less than derived from earlier models.
Moreover, for moderately flat cluster mass functions (gamma < 2), and/or for
mass functions with a high mass cut-off (M_max > 10^5 M_sun), stars exhibit a
high degree of clumping in C-space that can be identified even in relatively
small data samples. Since stellar abundances can be modified by mass transfer
in close binaries, clustered signatures are essential for deriving the yields
of the first supernovae. We present a statistical test to determine whether a
given set of observations exhibit such behaviour. Our initial work focusses on
two dimensions in C-space, but we show that the clustering signal can be
greatly enhanced by additional abundance axes. The proposed experiment will be
challenging on existing 8-10m telescopes, but relatively straightforward for a
multi-object echelle spectrograph mounted on a 25-40m telescope.

including spin liquids, valence bond crystals, pseudogapped metals, and
unconventional superconductivity. Of particular interest is that in several
materials there is a direct transition as a function of pressure from a spin
liquid Mott insulating state to a superconducting state. Experiments on these
materials raise a number of profound questions about the quantum behaviour of
frustrated systems, particularly the intimate connection between spin liquids
and superconductivity. Insights into these questions have come from a wide
range of theoretical techniques including first principles electronic
structure, quantum many-body theory and quantum field theory. In this review we
introduce the basic ideas of the field by discussing a simple frustrated
Heisenberg model with four spins. We then describe the key experimental
results, emphasizing that for two materials, k-(BEDT-TTF)_2Cu_2(CN)_3 and
EtMe_3Sb[Pd(dmit)_2]_2, there is strong evidence for a spin liquid ground
state, and for EtMe_3P[Pd(dmit)_2]_2, a valence bond solid ground state. We
review theoretical attempts to explain these phenomena, arguing that this can
be captured by a Hubbard model on the anisotropic triangular lattice at half
filling, and that resonating valence bond wavefunctions can capture most of the
essential physics. We review evidence that this model can have a spin liquid
ground state for a range of parameters that are realistic for the relevant
materials. We conclude by summarising the progress made thus far and
identifying some of the key questions still to be answered.

theories in physical space-time provides an analytic, semi-classical,
color-confining model for strongly-coupled QCD. The soft-wall AdS/QCD model
modified by a positive-sign dilaton metric leads to a remarkable one-parameter
description of nonperturbative hadron dynamics at zero quark mass, including a
zero-mass pion and a Regge spectrum of linear trajectories with the same slope
in orbital angular momentum $L$ and radial quantum number $n$ for both mesons
and baryons. One also predicts the form of the non-perturbative effective
coupling $\alpha_s^{AdS}(Q)$ and its $\beta$-function which agrees with the
effective coupling $\alpha_{g_1}$ extracted from the Bjorken sum rule.
Light-front holography, which connects the fifth-dimensional coordinate of AdS
space $z$ to an invariant impact separation variable $\zeta$, allows one to
compute the analytic form of the frame-independent light-front wavefunctions,
the fundamental entities which encode hadron properties as well as decay
constants, form factors, deeply virtual Compton scattering, exclusive heavy
hadron decays and other exclusive scattering amplitudes. One thus obtains a
relativistic description of hadrons in QCD at the amplitude level with
dimensional counting for hard exclusive reactions at high momentum transfer. As
specific examples we discuss the behavior of the pion and nucleon form factors
in the space-like and time-like regions. We also review the phenomenology of
exclusive processes including some anomalous empirical results.

have simple asymptotic forms near the point at which the particle plunges into

invariant length of the caustic. We further show that among the leading-order
horizon area increase, half arises from generators that enter the horizon
through the caustic, and the rest arises from area increase near the caustic,

as nuisance parameters whose values are intrinsically linked to the considered

Jeffreys methodology has been presented by Millar (2002) as a practical way to

clustering, the self-organization into separated agglomerations of individuals.
Several theories have been developed to explain clustering in, for instance,
multi-cellular organisms, ant colonies, bee hives, flocks of birds, schools of
fish, and animal herds. A persistent puzzle, however, is clustering of opinions
in human populations. The puzzle is particularly pressing if opinions vary
continuously, such as the degree to which citizens are in favor of or against a
vaccination program. Existing opinion formation models suggest that
""monoculture"" is unavoidable in the long run, unless subsets of the population
are perfectly separated from each other. Yet, social diversity is a robust
empirical phenomenon, although perfect separation is hardly possible in an
increasingly connected world. Considering randomness did not overcome the
theoretical shortcomings so far. Small perturbations of individual opinions
trigger social influence cascades that inevitably lead to monoculture, while
larger noise disrupts opinion clusters and results in rampant individualism
without any social structure. Our solution of the puzzle builds on recent
empirical research, combining the integrative tendencies of social influence
with the disintegrative effects of individualization. A key element of the new
computational model is an adaptive kind of noise. We conduct simulation
experiments to demonstrate that with this kind of noise, a third phase besides
individualism and monoculture becomes possible, characterized by the formation
of metastable clusters with diversity between and consensus within clusters.
When clusters are small, individualization tendencies are too weak to prohibit
a fusion of clusters. When clusters grow too large, however, individualization
increases in strength, which promotes their splitting.

unstable characters of face-centered cubic (fcc) phase and fct structure with
\emph{c/a}=1.111 are predicted. As for fct0.885 structure, our calculated
elastic constants explicitly indicate that it is mechanically stable. Elastic
moduli, Poisson's ratio, and Debye temperature are derived from elastic
constants. After analyzing total and partial densities of states and valence
electron charge distribution, we conclude that the Zr$-$H bonds in ZrH$_{2}$
exhibit weak covalent feature. But the ionic property is evident with about 1.5
electrons transferring from each Zr atom to H. Phonon spectrum results indicate

exploits the unique combination of area and sensitivity provided in the near-IR
by the camera Hawk-I at the VLT. We have obtained - 30 observing hours with
Hawk-I in the Y-band of two high galactic latitude fields. We combined the
Y-band data with deep J and K Hawk-I observations, and with FORS1/FORS2 U, B,
V, R, I, and Z observations to select z-drop galaxies having Z - Y > 1, no
optical detection and flat Y - J and Y - K colour terms. We detect 8
high-quality candidates in the magnitude range Y = 25.5 - 26.5 that we add to
the z-drop candidates selected in two Hawk-I pointings over the GOODS-South
field. We use this full sample of 15 objects found in -161 arcmin^2 of our
survey to constrain the average physical properties and the evolution of the
number density of z ~ 7 LBGs. A stacking analysis yields a best-fit SED with
photometric redshift z= 6.85 +0.20 -0.15 and an E(B-V)=0.05 +0.15 -0.05. We
compute a binned estimate of the z ~ 7 LF and explore the effects of
photometric scatter and model uncertainties on the statistical constraints.
After accounting for the expected incompleteness through MonteCarlo
simulations, we strengthen our previous finding that a Schechter luminosity
function constant from z=6 to z=7 is ruled out at a >99% confidence level, even
including the effects of cosmic variance. For galaxies brighter than M_1500=
-19.0, we derive a luminosity density rho_UV = 1.5^{+2.1}{-0.8} x 10^25
erg/s/Hz/Mpc^3, implying a decrease by a factor 3.5 from z=6 to z=6.8. We find
that, under standard assumptions, the emission rate of ionizing photons coming
from UV bright galaxies is lower by at least a factor of two than the value
required for reionization. Finally, we exploit deep Hawk-I J and K band
observations to derive an upper limit on the number density of M1500<~ -22.0

fields and is described by a Lagrangian that is invariant under Galilean shifts
in those fields. This paper is the first of two, and focuses on the motivation
and formulation of the theory. We show that the boundary effective theory of
the cascading cosmology model corresponds to a bi-galileon theory in the
decoupling limit, and argue that this is to be expected for co-dimension 2
braneworld models exhibiting infra-red modification of gravity. We then
generalise this, by constructing the most general bi-galileon Lagrangian. By
coupling one of the galileons to the energy-momentum tensor, we pitch this as a
modified gravity theory in which the modifications to General Relativity are
encoded in the dynamics of the two galileons. We initiate a study of
phenomenology by looking at maximally symmetric vacua and their stability,
developing elegant geometric techniques that trivially explain why some of the
vacua have to be unstable in certain cases (eg DGP). A detailed study of
phenomenology appears in our companion paper.

also displays hysteretical behaviour between the states not normally observed

purely phenomenological treatment of the spectra as an indication of the
canonical spectral state of the source during different periods of the
outburst. We find that the high energy hardness-intensity diagrams over two

Our XRT timing analysis shows that in the hard state there is significant
variability below 10Hz which is more pronounced at low energies, while during

detailed understanding for the specific role of the $Cu$-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ and

effective one-band Hubbard (1BH) or t-J model has been used. Here, the physics
is that of doping into a Mott-insulator, whereas the actual high-$T_c$ cuprates
are doped charge-transfer insulators. To shed light on the related question,
where the material-dependent physics enters, we compare the competing magnetic
and superconducting phases in the ground state, the single- and two-particle
excitations and, in particular, the pairing interaction and its dynamics in the
three-band Hubbard (3BH) and 1BH-models. Using a cluster embedding scheme, i.e.
the variational cluster approach (VCA), we find which frequencies are relevant
for pairing in the two models as a function of interaction strength and doping:
in the 3BH-models the interaction in the low- to optimal-doping regime is
dominated by retarded pairing due to low-energy spin fluctuations with
surprisingly little influence of inter-band (p-d charge) fluctuations. On the
other hand, in the 1BH-model, in addition a part comes from ""high-energy""
excited states (Hubbard band), which may be identified with a non-retarded
contribution. We find these differences between a charge-transfer and a Mott
insulator to be renormalized away for the ground-state phase diagram of the
3BH- and 1BH-models, which are in close overall agreement, i.e. are
""universal"". On the other hand, we expect the differences - and thus, the
material dependence to show up in the ""non-universal"" finite-T phase diagram

representing experiments in cavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics. We show
how such a system can be treated analytically in the ultrastrong coupling
limit, where the ratio $g/\Omega$ between coupling strength and oscillator
frequency approaches unity and goes beyond. In this regime the Jaynes-Cummings
model is known to fail, because counter-rotating terms have to be taken into
account. By using Van Vleck perturbation theory to higher orders in the qubit
tunneling matrix element $\Delta$ we are able to enlarge the regime of
applicability of existing analytical treatments, including in particular also
the finite bias case. We present a detailed discussion on the energy spectrum
of the system and on the dynamics of the qubit for an oscillator at low
temperature. We consider the coupling strength $g$ to all orders, and the
validity of our approach is even enhanced in the ultrastrong coupling regime.
Looking at the Fourier spectrum of the population difference, we find that many
frequencies are contributing to the dynamics. They are gathered into groups
whose spacing depends on the qubit-oscillator detuning. Furthermore, the
dynamics is not governed anymore by a vacuum Rabi splitting which scales
linearly with $g$, but by a non-trivial dressing of the tunneling matrix
element, which can be used to suppress specific frequencies through a variation
of the coupling.

geometry. We use magnetic resonance imaging techniques to measure velocities
and particle concentrations in flowing Newtonian fluid, yield stress fluid, and
in a concentrated suspension of noncolloidal particles in a yield stress fluid.
In the Newtonian fluid, we observe that the $\theta$-averaged strain rate
component $d_{r,\theta}$ decreases as the inverse squared radius in the gap, in
agreement with a Couette analogy. This allows direct comparison (without
end-effect corrections) of the resistances to shear in vane and Couette
geometries. Here, the mean shear stress in the vane-in-cup geometry is slightly
lower than in a Couette cell of same dimensions, and a little higher than when
the vane is embedded in an infinite medium. We also observe that the flow
enters deeply the region between the blades, leading to significant extensional
flow. In the yield stress fluid, in contrast with the usually accepted picture
based on simulation results from the literature, we find that the layer of
material that is sheared near the blades at low velocity is not cylindrical.
There is thus a significant extensional component of shear that should be taken
into account in the analysis. Finally and surprisingly, in the suspension, we
observe that a thin non-cylindrical slip layer made of the pure interstitial
yield stress fluid appears quickly at the interface between the sheared
material and the material that moves as a rigid body between the blades. This
feature can be attributed to the non-symmetric trajectories of the noncolloidal
particles around the edges of the blades. This new important observation is in
sharp contradiction with the common belief that the vane tool prevents slippage
and may preclude the use of the vane tool for studying the flows of pasty
materials with large particles.

Wi-Fi). In this context of hybrid connectivity, we propose Push-and-track, a

opportunities to minimize the load on the wireless infrastructure while
guaranteeing tight delivery delays. It achieves this through a control loop
that collects user-sent acknowledgements to determine if new copies need to be
reinjected into the network through the 3G interface. Push-and-Track includes
multiple strategies to determine how many copies of the content should be
injected, when, and to whom. The short delay-tolerance of common content, such
as news or road traffic updates, make them suitable for such a system. Based on
a realistic large-scale vehicular dataset from the city of Bologna composed of
more than 10,000 vehicles, we demonstrate that Push-and-Track consistently
meets its delivery objectives while reducing the use of the 3G network by over
90%.

interacting Fisher-Wright diffusions with an inferior and an advantageous type
with rare mutation (inferior to advantageous) and a (mean-field) spatial system
of supercritical branching random walks with an additional deathrate which is
quadratic in the local number of particles. The former describes a standard
two-type population under selection, mutation, the latter models describe a
population under scarce resources causing additional death at high local
population intensity. Geographic space is modelled by $\{1, \cdots, N\}$. The
first process starts in an initial state with only the inferior type present or
an exchangeable configuration and the second one with a single initial
particle. {This material is a special case of the theory developed in
\cite{DGsel}.}
  We study the behaviour in two time windows, first between time 0 and $T$ and
secondly after a large time when in the Fisher-Wright model the rare mutants
succeed respectively in the branching random walk the particle population
reaches a positive spatial intensity. It is shown that the second phase for
both models sets in after time $\alpha^{-1} \log N$, if $N$ is the size of
geographic space and $N^{-1}$ the rare mutation rate and $\alpha \in (0,
\infty)$ depends on the other parameters. We identify the limit dynamics in
both time windows and for both models as a nonlinear Markov dynamic
(McKean-Vlasov dynamic) respectively a corresponding random entrance law from
time $-\infty$ of this dynamic.
  Finally we explain that the two processes are just two sides of the very same
coin, a fact arising from duality, in particular the particle model generates
the genealogy of the Fisher-Wright diffusions with selection and mutation. We
discuss the extension of this duality relation to a multitype model with more

twisted magnetosphere model for magnetar emission. Starting from 3D Monte Carlo
simulations of the emerging spectrum, we produced a large database of synthetic
pulse profiles which was fitted to observed lightcurves in different spectral
bands and at different epochs. This allowed us to derive the physical
parameters of the model and their evolution with time, together with the
geometry of the two sources, i.e. the inclination of the line-of-sight and of
the magnetic axis with respect to the rotation axis. We then fitted the
(phase-averaged) spectra of the two TAXPs at different epochs using a model
similar to that used to calculate the pulse profiles ntzang in XSPEC) freezing
all parameters to the values obtained from the timing analysis, and leaving
only the normalization free to vary. This provided acceptable fits to
XMM-Newton data in all the observations we analyzed. Our results support a
picture in which a limited portion of the star surface close to one of the
magnetic poles is heated at the outburst onset. The subsequent evolution is
driven both by the cooling/varying size of the heated cap and by a progressive
untwisting of the magnetosphere.

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a condition of altered brain functional
connectivity. The great majority of these empirical studies rely on functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) which has a relatively poor temporal
resolution. Only a handful of studies have examined networks emerging from
dynamic coherence at the millisecond resolution and there are no investigations
of coherence at the lowest frequencies in the power spectrum - which has
recently been shown to reflect long-range cortico-cortical connections. Here we
used electroencephalography (EEG) to assess dynamic brain connectivity in ASD
focusing in the low-frequency (delta) range. We found that connectivity
patterns were distinct in ASD and control populations and reflected a double
dissociation: ASD subjects lacked long-range connections, with a most prominent
deficit in fronto-occipital connections. Conversely, individuals with ASD
showed increased short-range connections in lateral-frontal electrodes. This
effect between categories showed a consistent parametric dependency: as ASD
severity increased, short-range coherence was more pronounced and long-range
coherence decreased. Theoretical arguments have been proposed arguing that
distinct patterns of connectivity may result in networks with different
efficiency in transmission of information. We show that the networks in ASD
subjects have less Clustering coefficient, greater Characteristic Path Length
than controls -indicating that the topology of the network departs from
small-world behaviour- and greater modularity. Together these results show that
delta-band coherence reveal qualitative and quantitative aspects associated
with ASD pathology.

  apertures","15 pages, 3 figures",,,,"physics.plasm-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is proposed to use apertures with large acceptance angles to reduce the
integration time when studying the emissivity of laser induced plasmas by means
of the Abel inversion method. The spatial resolution lost due to contributions
of angled lines of sight to the intensity data collected along the plasma plume
diameter is restored by a special numerical data processing. The procedure is
meant for the laser induced plasma diagnostics and tomography when the
integration time needed to achieve a reasonable signal to noise ratio exceeds a
characteristic time scale of the plasma state variations which is short
especially at early stages of the plasma evolution.

+ x_j - x_{j+1} - ... - x_m \approx 0. So the list can be nearly balanced and
for this we only need one alternation between addition and subtraction. But
what if the x_i are k-dimensional integer vectors? Using results from
topological degree theory we show that balancing is still possible, now with k
alternations.
  This result is useful in multi-objective optimization, as it allows a
polynomial-time computable balance of two alternatives with conflicting costs.
The application to two multi-objective optimization problems yields the
following results:
  - A randomized 1/2-approximation for multi-objective maximum asymmetric
traveling salesman, which improves and simplifies the best known approximation
for this problem.
  - A deterministic 1/2-approximation for multi-objective maximum weighted
satisfiability.

short chains of acquaintances. In popular imagination this is captured in the
phrase six degrees of separation, implying that any two individuals are, at
most, six handshakes away. Social network analysis is the understanding of
concepts and information on relationships among interacting units in an
ecological system. In this analysis the properties of the actors are explained
in terms of the structures of links amongst them. In general, the relational
links between the actors are primary and the properties of the actors are
secondary. This paper presents two methods to calculate the average degree of
separation between the actors or nodes in a graph. We apply this approach to
other random graphs depicting social networks and then compare the
characteristics of these graphs with the average degree of separation.

shown to shear-band but it is as yet unclear why some materials develop
shear-band and some others do not. In order to rationalize existing data
concerning the flow characteristics of jammed systems and in particular
understand the physical origin of such a difference we propose a simple
approach for describing the steady flow behaviour of yield stress fluids, which
retains only basic physical ingredients. Within this frame we show that in the
liquid regime the behaviour of jammed systems turns from that of a simple yield
stress fluid (exhibiting homogeneous flows) to a shear-banding material when
the ratio of a characteristic relaxation time of the system to a restructuring
time becomes smaller than 1, thus suggesting a possible physical origin of
these trends.

chalcogenides, Pb$_n$Bi$_2$Se$_{n+3}$ and Pb$_n$Sb$_2$Te$_{n+3}$, are possible
new candidates for topological insulators. As $n$ increases, the phase
transition from a topological insulator to a band insulator is found to occur
between $n=2$ and 3 for both series. Significantly, among the new topological
insulators, we found a bulk band gap of 0.40eV in PbBi$_2$Se$_4$ which is one
of the largest gap topological insulators, and that Pb$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$ is
located in the immediate vicinity of the topological phase boundary, making its
topological phase easily tunable by changing external parameters such as
lattice constants. Due to the three-dimensional Dirac cone at the phase
boundary, massless Dirac fermions also may be easily accessible in
Pb$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$.

planet was measured with the HARPS spectrograph and the properties of the host
star were obtained analyzing HIRES spectra from the Keck telescope. It is a hot
Jupiter-like planet with an orbital period of 4.04 days, 1.3 Jupiter masses,
0.9 Jupiter radii, and a density of 2.34 g cm-3. It orbits a G0V star with
Teff=5945K, M*=1.09 Msun, R*=1.01 Rsun, solar metallicity, a lithium content of
+1.45 dex, and an estimated age between 0.12 and 3.15 Gyr. The lithium
abundance of the star is consistent with its effective temperature, activity
level, and age range derived from the stellar analysis. The density of the
planet is extreme for its mass. It implies the existence of an amount of heavy
elements with a mass between about 140 and 300 Mearth.

light curves. The algorithm CDA has the capability to remove random jumps and
systematic trends encountered in typical CoRoT data in a fully automatic
fashion. Since enormous jumps in flux can destroy the information content of a
light curve, such an algorithm is essential. From a study of 1030 light curves
in the CoRoT IRa01 field, we developed three simple assumptions which upon CDA
is based. We describe the algorithm analytically and provide some examples of
how it works. We demonstrate the functionality of the algorithm in the cases of
CoRoT0102702789, CoRoT0102874481, CoRoT0102741994, and CoRoT0102729260. Using
CDA in the specific case of CoRoT0102729260, we detect a candidate exoplanet
around the host star of spectral type G5, which remains undetected in the raw
light curve, and estimate the planetary parameters to be Rp=6.27Re and P=1.6986
