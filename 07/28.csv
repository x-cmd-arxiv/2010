interface between a perovskite manganite and other transition metal oxides. The
latter is specified by the electron number $n$ in the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ level as
$(d_{3z^2-r^2})^n$. Based on the molecular orbitals formed at the interface and
the generalized Hund's rule, the sign of the magnetic interaction is rather
uniquely determined. The exception is when the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital is
stabilized in the interfacial manganite layer neighboring to a
$(d_{3z^2-r^2})^1$ or $(d_{3z^2-r^2})^2$ system. In this case, the magnetic
interaction is sensitive to the occupancy of the Mn $d_{3z^2-r2}$ orbital. It
is also shown that the magnetic interaction between the interfacial Mn layer
and the bulk region can be changed. Manganite-based heterostructures thus show
a rich magnetic behavior. We also present how to generalize the argument
including $t_{2g}$ orbitals.

confirmed globular cluster (GC) in NGC 1399 through monitoring of its X-ray
activity. The source, with a peak luminosity of L_x=2x10^39 ergs/s, reveals an
order of magnitude change in the count rate within ~10 ks in a Chandra
observation. The BH resides in a metal-rich [Fe/H]~0.2 globular cluster. After
RZ2109 in NGC 4472 this is only the second black-hole X-ray source in a GC
confirmed via rapid X-ray variability. Unlike RZ2109, the X-ray spectrum of
this BH source did not change during the period of rapid variability. In
addition to the short-term variability the source also exhibits long-term
variability. After being bright for at least a decade since 1993 within a span
of 2 years it became progressively fainter, and eventually undetectable, or
marginally detectable, in deep Chandra and XMM observations. The source also
became harder as it faded. The characteristics of the long term variability in
itself provide sufficient evidence to identify the source as a BH. The long
term decline in the luminosity of this object was likely not recognized in
previous studies because the rapid variability within the bright epoch
suppressed the average luminosity in that integration. The hardening of the
spectrum accompanying the fading would also make this black hole source
indistinguishable from an accreting neutron star in some epochs. Therefore some
low mass X-ray binaries identified as NS accretors in snapshot studies of
nearby galaxies may also be BHs. Thus the discovery of the second confirmed BH
in an extragalactic GC through rapid variability at the very least suggests
that accreting BHs in GCs are not exceedingly rare occurences.

emission are a key tool to disentangle the various possible emission processes
and scenarios proposed to interpret the complex gamma-ray burst phenomenology.
Aims: We collected a large dataset on GRB060908 in order to carry out a
comprehensive analysis of the prompt emission as well as the early and late
afterglow. Methods: Data from Swift-BAT, -XRT and -UVOT together with data from
a number of different ground-based optical/NIR and millimeter telescopes
allowed us to follow the afterglow evolution from about a minute from the
high-energy event down to the host galaxy limit. We discuss the physical
parameters required to model these emissions. Results: The prompt emission of
GRB060908 was characterized by two main periods of activity, spaced by a few
seconds of low intensity, with a tight correlation between activity and
spectral hardness. Observations of the afterglow began less than one minute
after the high-energy event, when it was already in a decaying phase, and it
was characterized by a rather flat optical/NIR spectrum which can be
interpreted as due to a hard energy-distribution of the emitting electrons. On
the other hand, the X-ray spectrum of the afterglow could be fit by a rather
soft electron distribution. Conclusions: GRB060908 is a good example of a
gamma-ray burst with a rich multi-wavelength set of observations. The
availability of this dataset, built thanks to the joint efforts of many
different teams, allowed us to carry out stringent tests for various
interpretative scenarios showing that a satisfactorily modeling of this event
is challenging. In the future, similar efforts will enable us to obtain
optical/NIR coverage comparable in quality and quantity to the X-ray data for
more events, therefore opening new avenues to progress gamma-ray burst
research.

cluster has received little attenti on, probably because the line of sight to
it crosses twice the Carina spiral arm, which causes a significant
contamination of its color-magnitude diagram (CMD) by field stars, therefore
complicating seriously its interpretation. We provide more robust estimates of
the fundamental parameters of Trumpler 20, and investigate the most prominent
features of its CMD: a rich He-burning star clump, and a vertical sequence of
stars above the turnoff, which can be either blue stragglers or field stars.

heliocentric distance of Trumpler 20, which we estimate to be 1.4 $\pm$ 0.2 Gyr
and 3.0 $\pm$ 0.3 kpc, respectively. As predicted by models, at this age the
clump has a tail towards fainter magnitudes and bluer colors, thus providing
further confirmation of the evolutionary status of stars in this particular
phase. The derived heliocentric distance places the cluster in the inter-arm
region between the Carina and Scutum arms, which naturally explains the
presence of the vertical sequence of stars (which was originally interpreted as
the cluster itself) observed in the upper part of the CMD.Most of these stars
would therefore belong to the general galactic field, while only a few of

several lepton flavours. These flavours have different Standard-Model Yukawa
couplings, which induce flavour-sensitive scattering processes and thermal
dispersion relations. Kinetic equilibrium, which is rapidly established and
maintained via gauge interactions, allows to simplify these equations to
kinetic equations for the matrix of lepton charge densities. In performing this
simplification, we notice that the rapid flavour-blind gauge interactions damp
the flavour oscillations of the leptons. Leptogenesis turns out to be in the
parametric regime where the flavour oscillations are overdamped and flavour
decoherence is mainly induced by flavour sensitive scatterings. We solve the
kinetic equations for the lepton number densities numerically and show that
they interpolate between the unflavoured and the fully flavoured regimes within

eccentricities and some large inclinations started changing the simple picture
of close-in planets having circular and well-aligned orbits. Two major
scenarios to form such planets are planet migration in a disk, and
planet--planet interactions combined with tidal dissipation. The former
scenario can naturally produce a circular and low-obliquity orbit, while the
latter implicitly assumes an initially highly eccentric and possibly
high-obliquity orbit, which are then circularized and aligned via tidal
dissipation. We investigate the tidal evolution of transiting planets on
eccentric orbits. We show that the current and future orbital evolution of
these systems is likely dominated by tidal dissipation, and not by a more
distant companion. Although most of these close-in planets experience orbital
decay all the way to the Roche limit, there are two characteristic evolution
paths for them, depending on the relative efficiency of tidal dissipation
inside the star and the planet. We point out that the current observations may
be consistent with one of them. Our results suggest that at least some of the
close-in planets with non-zero orbital eccentricity may have been formed by
tidally circularizing an initially eccentric orbit. We also find that even when
the stellar spin-orbit misalignment is observed to be small at present, some
systems could have had a highly misaligned orbit in the past. Finally, we also
re-examine the recent claim by Levrard et. al., who found that all orbital and
spin parameters evolve on a similar timescale to orbital decay.

to check that the simpler effective Hamiltonian is approximately unitarily
equivalent to the original one, in the appropriate asymptotic regime. In this
paper, we consider the Hamiltonian of an electron in a 2-dimensional periodic
potential (e.g. generated by the ionic cores of a crystalline solid) under the
influence of a uniform transverse magnetic field. We prove that such
Hamiltonian is approximately unitarily equivalent to a Hofstadter-like (resp.

The result concerning the case of weak magnetic field holds true in any

many efforts have been made to prove that the Lasso behaves like a variable
selection procedure at the price of strong (though unavoidable) assumptions on
the geometric structure of these variables, much less attention has been paid
to the analysis of the performance of the Lasso as a regularization algorithm.
Our first purpose here is to provide a conceptually very simple result in this
direction. We shall prove that, provided that the regularization parameter is
properly chosen, the Lasso works almost as well as the deterministic Lasso.
This result does not require any assumption at all, neither on the structure of
the variables nor on the regression function. Our second purpose is to
introduce a new estimator particularly adapted to deal with infinite countable
dictionaries. This estimator is constructed as an l0-penalized estimator among
a sequence of Lasso estimators associated to a dyadic sequence of growing
truncated dictionaries. The selection procedure automatically chooses the best
level of truncation of the dictionary so as to make the best tradeoff between
approximation, l1-regularization and sparsity. From a theoretical point of
view, we shall provide an oracle inequality satisfied by this selected Lasso
estimator. The oracle inequalities established for the Lasso and the selected
Lasso estimators shall enable us to derive rates of convergence on a wide class
of functions, showing that these estimators perform at least as well as greedy
algorithms. Besides, we shall prove that the rates of convergence achieved by
the selected Lasso estimator are optimal in the orthonormal case by bounding
from below the minimax risk on some Besov bodies. Finally, some theoretical
results about the performance of the Lasso for infinite uncountable
dictionaries will be studied in the specific framework of neural networks. All
the oracle inequalities presented in this paper are obtained via the
application of a single general theorem of model selection among a collection
of nonlinear models which is a direct consequence of the Gaussian concentration
inequality. The key idea that enables us to apply this general theorem is to
see l1-regularization as a model selection procedure among l1-balls.

tidal dissipation and mass loss. The fate of a given binary system is
determined by the initial masses of the primary and companion, the initial
orbit (taken to be circular), the Reimers mass-loss parameter, and the tidal
prescription employed. For a range of these parameters, we determine whether
the orbit expands due to mass loss or decays due to tidal torques. Where a
common envelope (CE) phase ensues, we estimate the final orbital separation
based on the energy required to unbind the envelope. These calculations predict
period gaps for planetary and brown dwarf companions to white dwarfs. In
particular, the lower end of the gap is the longest period at which companions
survive their CE phase while the upper end of the gap is the shortest period at
which a CE phase is avoided. For binary systems with 1 $M_\odot$ progenitors,
we predict no Jupiter-mass companions with periods $\lesssim$270 days. For

channel of the eavesdropper is arbitrarily varying over time. Assuming that the
number of antennas of the eavesdropper is limited, the secrecy rate of the MIMO
wiretap channel in the sense of strong secrecy is derived, and shown to match
with the converse in secure degrees of freedom. It is proved that there exists
a universal coding scheme that secures the confidential message against any

conclusion that secure communication is possible regardless of the location or
channel states of (potentially infinite number of) eavesdroppers. Additionally,
it is observed that, the present setting renders the secrecy capacity problems

  A corollary of our result is that if $G$ is $d$-regular with $1 \leq d \leq
5$ then $$ {\rm ind}(G) \leq \left(2^{d+1}-1\right)^\frac{|V(G)|}{2d}, $$ with
equality if and only if $G$ is a disjoint union of $V(G)/2d$ copies of
$K_{d,d}$. This bound (for all $d$) was conjectured by Alon and Kahn and
recently proved for all $d$ by the second author, without the characterization
of the extreme cases.
  Our proof involves a reduction to a finite search. For graphs with maximum
degree at most $3$ the search could be done by hand, but for the case of
maximum degree $4$ or $5$, a computer is needed.

assigned the product of its (nonnegative) determinant |rho| and the determinant

of Peres and Horodecki, signify the entanglement of rho. Integrating this
product, |rho| |rho^{PT}| =|rho rho^{PT}|, over the nine-dimensional space,

determinants, thus, form a pair of multivariate orthogonal polynomials with
respect to HS measure. It is hypothesized that the analogous two determinants
for the standard fifteen-dimensional convex set of two-qubit density matrices
are similarly orthogonal. However, orthogonality does not hold, we find, if the
symmetry of the nine-dimensional two-rebit scenario is broken slightly, nor
with the use of non-flat measures, such as the prominent Bures (minimal

$\lambda > 0$ and capacity $C=1$, on a graph $G$, concerns a probability
measure on the set ${\mathcal I}(G)$ of independent sets of $G$, with the
measure of each independent set $I \in {\mathcal I}(G)$ being proportional to
$\lambda^{|I|}$.
  Ramanan et al. proposed a generalization of the hard core model as an
idealized model of multicasting in communication networks. In this
generalization, the {\em multi-state} hard core model, the capacity $C$ is
allowed to be a positive integer, and a configuration in the model is an
assignment of states from $\{0,\ldots,C\}$ to $V(G)$ (the set of nodes of $G$)
subject to the constraint that the states of adjacent nodes may not sum to more
than $C$. The activity associated to state $i$ is $\lambda^{i}$, so that the
probability of a configuration $\sigma:V(G)\rightarrow \{0,\ldots, C\}$ is
proportional to $\lambda^{\sum_{v \in V(G)} \sigma(v)}$.
  In this work, we consider this generalization when $G$ is an infinite rooted
$b$-ary tree and prove rigorously some of the conjectures made by Ramanan et
al. In particular, we show that the $C=2$ model exhibits a (first-order) phase
transition at a larger value of $\lambda$ than the $C=1$ model exhibits its
(second-order) phase transition. In addition, for large $b$ we identify a short
interval of values for $\lambda$ above which the model exhibits phase
co-existence and below which there is phase uniqueness. For odd $C$, this
transition occurs in the region of $\lambda = (e/b)^{1/\ceil{C/2}}$, while for
even $C$, it occurs around $\lambda=(\log b/b(C+2))^{2/(C+2)}$. In the latter
case, the transition is first-order.

events. More than 70% of bulge-dominated galaxies in this sample show tidal
features at a surface brightness limit of 28 mag arcsec^-2. We find that, while
they inhabit the optical red sequence, they show a wide spread in their UV
colours (~4 mags), akin to what has been discovered recently in the general
early-type population. A strong correlation is found between UV colour and the
strength of the tidal distortions, such that the bluest galaxies are more
distorted. This strongly suggests that the blue UV colours seen in many nearby
early-types are driven by (low-level) merger-induced star formation within the
last 3 Gyrs, contributing less than 10% of the stellar mass. If the ongoing
mergers in this sample, which have a median mass ratio of 1:4, are
representative of the nearby red merger population, then less than 25% of the
new stellar mass in the remnants is typically added through merger-induced star
formation. While the dust extinction in the inter-stellar medium (ISM) in these
galaxies is small [E(B-V)<0.1], the local dust content of the star-forming
regions is, on average, a factor of 3 higher. Finally, we use our theoretical

superamplitudes for all local 5- and 6-point operators with SU(4)xSU(4)
symmetry at order alpha'^3. Their origin is the dilatonic operator exp(-6 phi)
R^4 in the closed-string effective action. (ii) We expand the 6-point closed

isolate the SU(8)-singlet contribution from exp(-6 phi) R^4. This allows us to
extract the matrix elements of the unique SU(8)-invariant supersymmetrization
of R^4. Their single-soft scalar limits are non-vanishing. This demonstrates
that the N=8 supergravity candidate counterterm R^4 is incompatible with

show that the transition from a geometrical background to a matrix phase makes
the description of noncommutative gauge theory in terms of fields via the Weyl

from cell population experiments. Such differences arise from stochastic events

some proteins, such oscillations may appear damped in the population average.
In this paper we investigate the role of RNA stochastic fluctuations as a
leading force to produce a sustained excitatory behavior at the single cell
level. Opposed to some previous models, we build a fully stochastic model of a
negative feedback loop that explicitly takes into account the RNA stochastic

Motivated by the recent appreciation of the importance of non--coding

possibility that a regulatory RNA transcript could bind to the messenger RNA

reduce gene expression variability both at the single cell level and at the

these high-energy processes, one expects further low-energy manifestations of
LFV such as radiative and three-body lepton decays. Under the assumption of a
type-I seesaw as the source of neutrino masses and mixings, all these LFV

three right-handed neutrino superfields, we conduct a systematic analysis

constant RVB gap is assumed which leads to Luttinger zeros along the
antiferromagnetic Brillouin zone (AFBZ) and four Fermi pockets centered on the
nodal directions. We relax the assumption of a constant RVB gap function,
treating it as a Ising order parameter accompanied by thermal fluctuations. If
these thermal fluctuations are very strong leading to strictly short range
correlations in the spatial dependence of the RVB gap, then the reconstruction
of the Fermi surface into pockets will not survive. We examined the
intermediate case of critical fluctuations leading to a power law falloff of
the RVB gap correlations. To this end we followed the analysis recently
developed by two of us to treat the effect of the power law correlations in the
antiferromagnetic 2-dimensional xy model on the single electron Green's
function. The partial truncation of the Fermi surface to form pockets survives
in the presence of power law correlations. The linewidth of the quasiparticle
peaks increases with the exponent of the power law correlations. If this
exponent is set at the value of critical fluctuations in the 2-dimensional
Ising model a relatively small linewidth is obtained. If this exponent is
doubled, a linewidth comparable to the values found in recent ARPES experiments
on underdoped BiSCO (Tc = 65 K) at T = 140K was obtained. The anisotropic
suppression of the quasiparticle peak around the Fermi pockets hides the back
side of the pockets closest to the AFBZ to give essentially Fermi arcs seen

nearby(redshift z = 0.004--0.027) Type Ia supernovae (SNe~Ia) observed in the
ultraviolet (UV) with the Swift Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope. Colors and
absolute magnitudes are calculated using both a standard Milky Way (MW)
extinction law and one for the Large Magellanic Cloud that has been modified by
circumstellar scattering. We find very different behavior in the near-UV
filters (uvw1_rc covering ~2600-3300 A after removing optical light, and u
~3000--4000 A) compared to a mid-UV filter (uvm2 ~2000-2400 A). The uvw1_rc-b
colors show a scatter of ~0.3 mag while uvm2-b scatters by nearly 0.9 mag.
Similarly, while the scatter in colors between neighboring filters is small in
the optical and somewhat larger in the near-UV, the large scatter in the
uvm2-uvw1 colors implies significantly larger spectral variability below 2600
A. We find that in the near-UV the absolute magnitudes at peak brightness of
normal SNe Ia in our sample are correlated with the optical decay rate with a
scatter of 0.4 mag, comparable to that found for the optical in our sample.
However, in the mid-UV the scatter is larger, ~1 mag, possibly indicating
differences in metallicity. We find no strong correlation between either the UV
light-curve shapes or the UV colors and the UV absolute magnitudes. With larger
samples, the UV luminosity might be useful as an additional constraint to help
determine distance, extinction, and metallicity in order to improve the utility
of SNe Ia as standardized candles.

He-like iron K$\alpha$ at 6.7~keV, H-like iron Ly$\alpha$ at 6.9~keV, and
He-like iron K$\beta$ at 7.8~keV. Among them, the 6.4~keV emission line is a
probe of non-thermal phenomena. We have detected strong 6.4~keV emission in
several giant molecular clouds, some of which were newly discovered by Suzaku.
All the spectra exhibit large equivalent widths of 1-2~keV and absorption
columns of $2-10\times 10^{23}\{\rm H\ cm}^{-2}$. We found time variability of
diffuse 6.4~keV emission in the Sgr B2 region comparing the maps and spectra
obtained from 1994 to 2005 with ASCA, Chandra, XMM-Newton and Suzaku. We also
report discovery of K$\alpha$ lines of neutral argon, calcium, chrome, and
manganese atoms in the Sgr~A region. We show that the equivalent width of the
6.4~keV emission line detected in X-ray faint region against the 6.4
keV-associated continuum (power-law component) is $\sim 800\ {\rm eV}$. These
features are naturally explained by the X-ray reflection nebula scenario rather
than the low energy cosmic-ray electrons scenario. On the other hand, a 6.4~keV
clump, G~0.162$-$0.217, discovered at the south end of the Radio Arc has a
small equivalent width of 6.4~keV emission line of $\sim200\ {\rm eV}$. The
Radio Arc is a site of relativistic electrons. Thus, it is conceivable that the
X-rays of G~0.162$-$0.217 are due to low energy cosmic-ray electrons

distance of the Sun of 8.5 kpc, the circular rotational velocity of the LSR at
the distance of the Sun of 220 km/s, and a flat Galactic rotation curve, S
Persei is suggested to have a non-circular motion deviating from the Galactic
circular rotation for 15 km/s, which is mainly dominated by the anti rotation
direction component of 12.9+/-2.9 km/s. This red supergiant is thought to
belong to the OB association, Per OB1, so that this non-circular motion is
representative of a motion of the OB association in the Milky Way. This
non-circular motion is somewhat larger than that explained by the standard
density-wave theory for a spiral galaxy, and is attributed to either a cluster
shuffling of the OB association, or to non-linear interactions between
non-stationary spiral arms and multi-phase interstellar media. The latter comes
from a new view of a spiral arm formation in the Milky Way suggested by recent

Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) remains a great challenge despite concerted
efforts for several decades. The advent of high quality vector magnetograms
obtained from Hinode (SOT/SP) has increased the possibility of meeting this
challenge. In particular, the Spatially Averaged Signed Shear Angle (SASSA)
seems to be an unique parameter to quantify the non-potentiality of the active
regions. We demonstrate the usefulness of SASSA for predicting the flare
severity. For this purpose we present case studies of the evolution of magnetic
non-potentiality using 115 vector magnetograms of four active regions namely
ARs NOAA 10930, 10960, 10961 and 10963 during December 08-15, 2006, June 03-10,
2007, June 28-July 5, 2007 and July 10-17, 2007 respectively. The NOAA ARs
10930 and 10960 were very active and produced X and M class flares
respectively, along with many smaller X-ray flares. On the other hand, the NOAA
ARs 10961 and 10963 were relatively less active and produced only very small
(mostly A and B-class) flares. For this study we have used a large number of
high resolution vector magnetograms obtained from Hinode (SOT/SP). The analysis
shows that the peak X-ray flux of the most intense solar flare emanating from
the active regions depends on the magnitude of the SASSA at the time of the
flare. This finding of the existence of a lower limit of SASSA for a given
class of X-ray flare will be very useful for space weather forecasting. We have
also studied another non-potentiality parameter called mean weighted shear
angle (MWSA) of the vector magnetograms along with SASSA. We find that the MWSA
does not show such distinction as the SASSA for upper limits of GOES X-Ray flux
of solar flares, however both the quantities show similar trends during the
evolution of all active regions studied.

additional driving force that results in a drastic decrease of both the
nucleation critical radius and the saddle point energy. A very sharp transition
is evidenced, at which the saddle point totally disappears and nucleation
becomes spontaneous. This transition occurs for a well defined critical stress
corresponding to both a critical density of geometrically necessary
dislocations and a critical strain, without invoking any critical nucleus size

attention because of its extreme TeV variability characteristics during an
exceptional flaring period in 2006. Among the observed key findings are (i) a
minimum variability timescale as short as $\sim 200$ sec and (ii) highly
variable TeV emission, which in the frequency interval [$10^{-4}$ Hz, $10^{-2}$
Hz] can be described by a log-normal distribution and suggests an underlying
multiplicative (and not additive) process. Aims: Simultaneously accounting for
these findings appears difficult within conventional approaches. Following
earlier suggestions for the TeV blazar Mkn 501, we explore a possible scenario
where PKS 2155-304 is supposed to harbor a supermassive binary black hole
system and where the observed TeV variability is dominated by emission from the
less massive black hole. Methods: We analyze the constraints on the very high
energy (VHE) source imposed by the observed variability characteristics and the
integrated VHE luminosity output, and discuss its implications for a binary
black hole system. Results: We show that for a secondary mass of $m_{\rm BH}
\sim 10^7 M_{\odot}$, fluctuations in the disk accretion rate that feed the jet
could account for the observed red-noise type variability process down to
frequencies of $\sim 10^{-2}$ Hz. Jet curvature induced by orbital motion, on
the other hand, could further relax constraints on the intrinsic jet speeds.
Conclusions: Because a binary system can lead to different (yet not
independent) periodicities in different energy bands, a longterm (quasi-)
periodicity analysis could offer important insights into the real nature of the
central engine of PKS~2155-304.

models that are capable of explaining simultaneously the observed $N$-$z$
relation given by the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey, which still seems to exhibit
a spatial periodicity of the galaxy distribution(the 'picket-fence structure'),
and the CMB spectrum obtained by the WMAP experiments. It is found that both
the observed size of the spatial periodicity and the amplitude of the 2dF
$N$-$z$ relation can be fairly well fitted by the theoretical computations
based on the scalar field models with $-20\le \xi\le -10$, and $140\le m_{\rm
s} \le 160$, where $\xi$ is the gravitational coupling parameter, and $m_{\rm
s}$ the normalized mass of the scalar field, respectively. To reproduce the CMB
spectrum of the WMAP, we find that it is very crucial to have a null state of
the scalar field in the early epochs of evolution of the universe.

The focus of this paper is to provide accurate cluster-level DVFS control for
power saving in a server cluster. To achieve this goal, we propose a request
tracing approach that online classifies the major causal path patterns of a
multi-tier service and monitors their performance data as a guide for accurate
DVFS control. The request tracing approach significantly decreases the time
cost of performance profiling experiments that aim to establish the empirical
performance model. Moreover, it decreases the controller complexity so that we
can introduce a much simpler feedback controller, which only relies on the
single-node DVFS modulation at a time as opposed to varying multiple CPU
frequencies simultaneously. Based on the request tracing approach, we present a
hybrid DVFS control system that combines an empirical performance model for
fast modulation at different load levels and a simpler feedback controller for
adaption. We implement a prototype of the proposed system, called PowerTracer,
and conduct extensive experiments on a 3-tier platform. Our experimental
results show that PowerTracer outperforms its peer in terms of power saving and
system performance.

lost by the continuum model at the coupling interface. Therefore, we present a
multiscale lattice Boltzmann (LB) method which deploys high-order LB models in
highly rarefied flow regions and low-order ones in less rarefied regions. Since
this multiscale approach is based on the same theoretical framework, the
coupling precess becomes simple. The non-equilibrium information will not be

when we wish to know the results for each sample rather than the average
prevalence of positive samples. If the proportion of positive samples is low
considerable resources may be devoted to testing samples most of which are
negative. An attractive strategy is to pool samples. If the pooled samples test
positive one must then test the individual samples, otherwise they can all be
assumed to be negative. The pool should be big enough to reduce the number of
tests but not so big that the pooled samples are almost all positive. We show
that if the prevalence of positive samples is greater than 30% it is never
worth pooling. From 30% down to 1% pools of size 4 are close to optimal. Below
1% substantial gains can be made by pooling, especially if the samples are
pooled twice. However, with large pools the sensitivity of the test will fall
correspondingly and this must be taken into consideration. We derive simple
expressions for the optimal pool size and for the corresponding proportion of
samples tested.

for interacting bosons in a 3D trap. Quasi phase transitions are observed in
all these cases, including one-dimension, as shown by a rapid change of all the
thermodynamic quantities at the transition point. The change becomes more rapid
as $N$ increases in 2D and 3D cases. However with increase in $N$, the sudden

fluid-fluid demixing of a binary mixture of hard hyperspheres, i.e. the
demixing occurs for lower mixture size asymmetry as compared to the
three-dimensional case. However, according to simulations, in the latter
dimension the fluid-fluid demixing is metastable with respect to the
fluid-solid transition. According to the results obtained from approximations
to the equation of state of hard hyperspheres in higher dimensions, the
fluid-fluid demixing might becomes stable for high enough dimension. However,
this conclusion is rather speculative since none of the above works have taken
into account the stability of the crystalline phase (nor by a minimization of a
given density functional, neither spinodal calculations or MC simulations). Of
course, the lack of results is justified by the difficulty for performing
density functional calculations or simulations in high dimensions and, in
particular, for highly asymmetric binary mixtures. In the present work, we will
take advantage of a well tested theoretical tool, namely the fundamental
measure density functional theory for parallel hard hypercubes (in the
continuum and in the hypercubic lattice). With this, we have calculated the
fluid-fluid and fluid-solid spinodals for different spatial dimensions. We have
obtained, no matter of the dimensionality, the mixture size asymmetry nor the
polydispersity (included as a bimodal distribution function centered around the
asymmetric edge-lengths), that the fluid-fluid critical point is always located
above the fluid-solid spinodal. In conclusion, these results point to the
existence of demixing between at least one solid phase rich in large particles
and one fluid phase rich in small ones, preempting a fluid-fluid demixing,
independently of the spatial dimension or the polydispersity.

structure in eukaryotic cells. Many physiological processes rely on dramatic
shape and topological changes (e.g. fusion, fission) of fluid membrane systems.
Fluidity is key to the versatility and constant reorganization of lipid
bilayers. Here, we study the role of the membrane intrinsic viscosity, arising
from the friction of the lipid molecules as they rearrange to accommodate shape
changes, in the dynamics of morphological changes of fluid vesicles. In
particular, we analyze the competition between the membrane viscosity and the
viscosity of the bulk fluid surrounding the vesicle as the dominant dissipative
mechanism. We consider the relaxation dynamics of fluid vesicles put in an
out-of-equilibrium state, but conclusions can be drawn regarding the kinetics
or power consumption in regulated shape changes in the cell. On the basis of
numerical calculations, we find that the dynamics arising from the membrane
viscosity are qualitatively different from the dynamics arising from the bulk
viscosity. When these two dissipation mechanisms are put in competition, we
find that for small vesicles the membrane dissipation dominates, with a
relaxation time that scales as the size of the vesicle to the power 2. For
large vesicles, the bulk dissipation dominates, and the exponent in the
relaxation time vs. size relation is 3.

careful device engineering, we isolate support-induced losses and perform the
first rigorous experimental test of the strong geometric dependence of this

to the linear order in the small parameter - the quartic self-coupling - the

order in the quartic self-coupling the statistical anisotropy is free of the
infrared effects. The latter show up at the quadratic order in the

statistical anisotropy is a combination of a larger term which, however, decays
as momentum increases, and a smaller term which is independent of momentum.

contamination to BzK selection. We find that the shape of the 1.6um bump is
robust, and photometric redshifts are not greatly affected by choice of model

ground-based observations and modeled using the KOSMA-tau model for photon
dominated regions. Here we derive the physical conditions in S140 and in
particular the origin of [C II] emission around IRS1. We identify three
distinct regions of [C II] emission from the cut, one close to the embedded

photon-dominated regions. At the position of IRS1, we identify at least two
distinct components contributing to the [C II] emission, one of them a small,
hot component, which can possibly be identified with the irradiated outflow
walls. This is consistent with the fact that the [C II] peak at IRS1 coincides
with shocked H2 emission at the edges of the outflow cavity. We note that
previously available observations of IRS1 can be well reproduced by a
single-component KOSMA-tau model. Thus it is HIFI's unprecedented spatial and

X-ray fluxes of low-mass X-ray binaries remain an unexplained phenomenon. Among
other ideas, it has been suggested that a non-linear resonance between two
oscillation modes in an accretion disc orbiting either a black hole or a
neutron star plays a role in exciting the observed modulation. Several possible
resonances have been discussed. A particular model assumes resonances in which
the disc-oscillation modes have the eigenfrequencies equal to the radial and
vertical epicyclic frequencies of geodesic orbital motion. This model has been
discussed for black hole microquasar sources as well as for a group of neutron
star sources. Assuming several neutron (strange) star equations of state and
Hartle-Thorne geometry of rotating stars, we briefly compare the frequencies
expected from the model to those observed. Our comparison implies that the
inferred neutron star radius ""RNS"" is larger than the related radius of the
marginally stable circular orbit ""rms"" for nuclear matter equations of state
and spin frequencies up to 800Hz. For the same range of spin and a strange star
(MIT) equation of state, the inferrred radius RNS is roughly equal to rms. The
Paczynski modulation mechanism considered within the model requires that RNS <
rms. However, we find this condition to be fulfilled only for the strange
matter equation of state, masses below one solar mass, and spin frequencies
above 800Hz. This result most likely falsifies the postulation of the neutron
star 3:2 resonant eigenfrequencies being equal to the frequencies of geodesic
radial and vertical epicyclic modes. We suggest that the 3:2 epicyclic modes
could stay among the possible choices only if a fairly non-geodesic accretion
flow is assumed, or if a different modulation mechanism operates.

this limit corresponds to having a locally isothermal equation of state. We
present some simple models that are able to capture the dependence of the
torque on diffusive processes to within 20% of the numerical simulations.

states, are essential for fundamental tests of quantum mechanics and optical
quantum technologies. The most widespread technique for creating these quantum
resources is the spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) of laser light
into photon pairs. Conservation of energy and momentum in this process, known
as phase-matching, gives rise to strong correlations which are used to produce
two-photon entanglement in various degrees of freedom. It has been a
longstanding goal of the quantum optics community to realise a source that can
produce analogous correlations in photon triplets, but of the many approaches
considered, none have been technically feasible. In this paper we report the
observation of photon triplets generated by cascaded down-conversion. Here each
triplet originates from a single pump photon, and therefore quantum
correlations will extend over all three photons in a way not achievable with
independently created photon pairs. We expect our photon-triplet source to open
up new avenues of quantum optics and become an important tool in quantum
technologies. Our source will allow experimental interrogation of novel quantum
correlations, the post-selection free generation of tripartite entanglement
without post- selection and the generation of heralded entangled-photon pairs
suitable for linear optical quantum computing. Two of the triplet photons have
a wavelength matched for optimal transmission in optical fibres, ideally suited
for three-party quantum communication. Furthermore, our results open
interesting regimes of non-linear optics, as we observe spontaneous
down-conversion pumped by single photons, an interaction also highly relevant
to optical quantum computing.

vertically. The omnipresence of coronal magnetic loops implies gradients of the
equilibrium plasma quantities like the density, magnetic field and temperature.
These gradients are responsible for the excitation of drift waves that grow
both within the two-component fluid description (in the presence of collisions
and without it) and within the two-component kinetic descriptions (due to
purely kinetic effects). In the present work the effects of the density
gradient in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field vector are
investigated within the kinetic theory, in both electrostatic and
electromagnetic regimes. The electromagnetic regime implies the coupling of the
gradient-driven drift wave with the Alfven wave. The growth rates for the two
cases are calculated and compared. It is found that, in general, the
electrostatic regime is characterized by stronger growth rates, as compared
with the electromagnetic perturbations. Also discussed is the stochastic
heating associated with the drift wave. The released amount of energy density
due to this heating should be more dependent on the magnitude of the background
magnetic field than on the coupling of the drift and Alfven waves. The
stochastic heating is expected to be much higher in regions with a stronger
magnetic field. On the whole, the energy release rate caused by the stochastic
heating can be several orders of magnitude above the value presently accepted
as necessary for a sustainable coronal heating.

Surprisingly, we find that for tilt boundaries in the vicinity of both the

density of 5-7 defect pairs are stronger than the low-angle boundaries which
are comprised of fewer defects per unit length. Interestingly, the trends in
our results cannot be explained by a continuum Griffith-type fracture mechanics
criterion, which predicts the opposite trend due to that fact that it does not
account for the critical bonds that are responsible for the failure mechanism.
We have identified the highly-strained bonds in the 7-member rings that lead to
the failure of the sheets, and we have found that large angle boundaries are
able to better accommodate the strained 7-rings. Our results provide guidelines

interpretation of special relativity, which (Klein 1910) is the theory of the
invariants of the metric under the Poincar\'e group of collineations. This
invariance property is physical and different from coordinate properties.
Coordinates are physically empty (Kretschmann 1917) if not specified by
physics, and one shall look for physics again through the invariance group of
the metric. To find the invariance group for the metric, the Lie ""Mitschleppen""
is ideal for this task both in special and in general relativity. For a general
solution of the latter the invariance group is nil, and general relativity
behaves as an absolute theory, but when curvature vanishes the invariance group
is the group of infinitesimal Poincar\'e ""Mitschleppen"" of special relativity.
Solutions of general relativity exist with invariance groups intermediate
between the previously mentioned extremes. The Killing group properties of the
static solutions of general relativity were investigated by Ehlers and Kundt
(1964). The particular case of Schwarzschild's solution is examined, and the
original choice of the manifold done by Schwarzschild in 1916 is shown to
derive invariantly from the uniqueness of the timelike, hypersurface orthogonal
Killing vector of that solution.

sort of domain structure arising after any phase transition which represents

polynomial vector fields of degree d in the complex plane, decomposed by the

number of loci in parameter space consisting of vector fields with the same
combinatorial data (corresponding to topological classification with fixed

  This paper answers questions posed by Adam L. Epstein and Tan Lei about the
total number of combinatorial classes and the number of combinatorial classes
corresponding to loci of a specific (real) dimension q in parameter space, for
fixed degree d. These results are extensions of a result by Douady, Estrada,

structurally stable complex polynomial vector fields of degree d in the complex

classes is equivalent to a so-called bracketing problem. Then we analyze the
generating functions and find closed-form expressions for the number of
classes, as functions of d and q, and we furthermore make an asymptotic
analysis of these sequences for d tending to infinity.
  These results are also applicable to special classes of Abelian
differentials, quadratic differentials with double poles, and singular
holomorphic foliations of the plane.

infinite dimensional Hubbard-Holstein model at half filling. Our study is based
on the dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) combined with the numerical
renormalization group (NRG), which allows us to handle both strong
electron-electron and strong electron-phonon interactions. The transition line
is characterized by an effective electron-electron interaction. Depending on
this effective interaction and the phonon frequency $\omega_0$ one finds either
a continuous transition or discontinuous transition. Here, the analysis focuses
on the behavior of the system when the electron-electron repulsion $U$ and the
phonon-mediated attraction $\lambda$ are equal. We first discuss the adiabatic
and antiadiabatic limiting cases. For finite $\omega_0$ we study the
differences between the antiferromagnetic (AFM) and charge order, and find that
when present the AFM state has a lower energy on the line.

electronic properties of graphene is explored. In particular, it is noted that
the massless Dirac theory in point enjoys local Weyl symmetry, a very large
symmetry. Exploiting this symmetry in the two spatial dimensions and in the
associated three dimensional spacetime, we find the geometric constraints that
correspond to specific shapes of the graphene sheet for which the electronic
density of states is the same as that for planar graphene, provided the
measurements are made in accordance to the inner reference frame of the
electronic system. These results rely on the (surprising) general
relativistic-like behavior of the graphene system arising from the combination
of its well known special relativistic-like behavior with the less explored
Weyl symmetry. Mathematical structures, such as the Virasoro algebra and the
Liouville equation, naturally arise in this three-dimensional context and can
be related to specific profiles of the graphene sheet. Speculations on possible
applications of three-dimensional gravity are also proposed.

elemental manganese doped with dilute amounts of indium. beta-Mn is an example
of a topologically frustrated antiferromagnetically correlated metal - but
which remains paramagnetic at all temperatures. The addition of In to beta-Mn
results in a vast volume expansion of the lattice, and would therefore be
expected to have a major effect on the stability and localization of the Mn
moment - as observed in, for example, Ru and Al doped beta-Mn alloys. We find
that In doping in beta-Mn results in a short-range ordered spin-glass like
ground state, similar to that of Al-doped beta-Mn but with residual low
frequency spin fluctuations. This is in contrast to Ru doping which results in
the stabilization of a long-range ordered Mn moment

from optical reflection and transmission measurements of electron doped
BaFe$_2$As$_2$ crystals and films. The data is consistent with gap nodes or
possibly a very small gap in the crossover region between these two
possibilities. This can arise when one of the several pockets known to exist in
these systems has extended s-wave gap symmetry with an anisotropic piece
canceling or nearly so the isotropic part in some momentum direction.
Alternatively, a node can be lifted by impurity scattering which reduces
anisotropy. We find that the smaller gap on the hole pocket at the $\Gamma$
point in the Brillouin zone is isotropic s-wave while the electron pocket at
the $M$ point has a larger gap which is anisotropic and falls in the crossover
region.
