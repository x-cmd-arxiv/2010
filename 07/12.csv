Feynman path integral consists in taking first the limit of infinite speed of
light and then the limit of short time slice. In this order of limits the light
cone of the path integral disappears, giving rise to an instantaneous spread of
the wave function to the entire space. We ascribe the failure of Schroedinger's
equation to retain the light cone of the path integral to the very nature of
the limiting process: it is a regular expansion of a singular approximation
problem, because the boundary conditions of the path integral on the light cone
are lost in this limit. We propose a distinguished limit, which produces an
intermediate model between non-relativistic and relativistic quantum mechanics:
it produces Schroedinger's equation and preserves the zero boundary conditions
on and outside the original light cone of the path integral. These boundary
conditions relieve the Schroedinger equation of several annoying, seemingly
unrelated unphysical artifacts, including non-analytic wave functions,
spontaneous appearance of discontinuities, non-existence of moments when the
initial wave function has a jump discontinuity (e.g., a collapsed wave function
after a measurement), the EPR paradox, and so on. The practical implications of
the present formulation are yet to be seen.

symplectic structure of spacetime M leads to an isomorphism between symplectic
geometry (M, \omega) and Riemannian geometry (M, g) where the deformations of
symplectic structure \omega in terms of electromagnetic fields F=dA are
transformed into those of Riemannian metric g. This approach for quantum
gravity allows a background independent formulation where spacetime as well as
matter fields is equally emergent from a universal vacuum of quantum gravity

complexity-theoretic hardness results can be used as shields against attacks.
However, all the work in this line has assumed that the attacker employs just a
single type of attack. In this paper, we model and study the case in which the
attacker launches a multipronged (i.e., multimode) attack. We do so to more
realistically capture the richness of real-life settings. For example, an
attacker might simultaneously try to suppress some voters, attract new voters
into the election, and introduce a spoiler candidate. Our model provides a
unified framework for such varied attacks, and by constructing polynomial-time
multiprong attack algorithms we prove that for various election systems even

photon-torsion axial coupling in the quantum electrodynamics (QED) framework in
Riemann flat spacetime contortion decays. The geometrical optics in
Riemann-Cartan spacetime is considering and a plane wave expansion of the
electromagnetic vector potential is considered leading to a set of the
equations for the ray congruence. Since we are interested mainly on the torsion
effects in this first report we just consider the Riemann-flat case composed of
the Minkowskian spacetime with torsion. It is also shown that in torsionic de
Sitter background the vacuum polarisation does alter the propagation of
individual photons, an effect which is absent in Riemannian spaces. It is shown
that the cosmological torsion background inhomogeneities induce Lorentz
violation and massive photon modes in this QED. Magnetic dynamos in this
torsioned spacetime electrodynamics are simpler obtained in Fourier space than
the cosmic ones, previously obtained by Bassett et al Phys Rev D, in Friedmann
universe. By deriving plasma dispersion for linear electrodynamics in Riemann
Cartan spacetime, dynamo action seems to be possible for plasma frequencies in

the X-ray band. This field has been very active in the last ten years, thanks
to the data gathered from the Chandra and XMM satellites. Clusters of galaxies
are prominent X-ray sources thanks to thermal bremsstrahlung emission from the
diffuse ICM heated to 10^7-10^8 K, which provides about 15% of their total
mass. The analysis of the X-ray emission from groups and clusters allows to
study the large scale structure of the Universe, to constrain the cosmological
parameters, and to investigate the interaction between the ICM and the cluster
galaxies. My scientific work is mainly focused on the realization of a new
X-ray survey of galaxy clusters, the SXCS, obtained from the previously
unexplored archive of the X-Ray Telescope (XRT) on board of the Swift
satellite. The goal is not only to build a new catalogue, but also to
characterize the thermodynamical and chemical properties of the brightest
groups and clusters in the survey catalogue. Moreover, given the overall
characteristics of the survey, I also expect to detect some clusters at
redshift z>1, which will have a strong impact in the study of the large scale
structure of the Universe and the cosmological parameters. During my work I
also contributed substantially to the image simulator code of a new proposed
X-ray mission submitted to the NASA Astro 2010 Decadal Survey: the Wide Field
X-ray Telescope (WFXT). This work represents an important part of the
scientific case of WFXT, since, for first time in the simulations I included
realistic populations of all the source types contributing to the extragalactic
X-ray sky, namely groups and clusters of galaxies, active galactic nuclei, and
star-forming galaxies. Thanks to this work, the scientific cases of WFXT can
now be tested on solid ground.

constant proportional to the oscillator position. The oscillator-spin
interaction produces a second order phase transition at $\theta=1$ with the
oscillator position as its order parameter: the equilibrium position is zero
for $\theta>1$ and non-zero for $\theta< 1$. For $\theta<1$, the dynamics of
this system is quite different from relaxation to equilibrium. For most initial
conditions, the oscillator position performs modulated oscillations about one
of the stable equilibrium positions with a long relaxation time. For random
initial conditions and a sufficiently large spin system, the unstable zero
position of the oscillator is stabilized after a relaxation time proportional
to $\theta$. If the spin system is smaller, the situation is the same until the

mechanisms for wave ""absorption"" in solar magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). But are
they really distinct? We re-examine a well-known simple resonant absorption
model in a cold MHD plasma that places the resonance inside an evanescent
region. The normal mode solutions display the standard singular resonant
features. However, these same normal modes may be used to construct a ray
bundle which very clearly undergoes mode conversion to an Alfv\'en wave with no
singularities. We therefore conclude that resonant absorption and mode
conversion are in fact the same thing, at least for this model problem. The
prime distinguishing characteristic that determines which of the two
descriptions is most natural in a given circumstance is whether the converted
wave can provide a net escape of energy from the conversion/absorption region
of physical space. If it cannot, it is forced to run away in wavenumber space
instead, thereby generating the arbitrarily small scales in situ that we
recognize as fundamental to resonant absorption and phase mixing. On the other
hand, if the converted wave takes net energy way, singularities do not develop,
though phase mixing may still develop with distance as the wave recedes.

The first part $T_1 =2m\prod_{i=1}^{l-1}d(\epsilon_i)$, is related with the

related with the network structure. Based on the analytic results, we propose a
natural measure for each path, i.e. $\varphi=\prod_{i=1}^{l-1}d(\epsilon_i)$,

path's performance in searching and transporting processes. By minimizing
$\varphi$, we also find RW optimal routing which is a combination of random

shortest path routing on any type of complex networks. Numerical simulations

that numerically and experimentally measured migration velocities are
considerably higher than the velocity estimated by the available analytical
solution using the Fax\'{e}n mirror image technique for $a/(a+c)\ll 1$ (here
$a$ is the bubble radius), when the clearance parameter $\varepsilon(= c/a)$ is

more affected by the high-order deformation modes with decreasing
$\varepsilon$. The numerical simulations are compared with a theoretical
migration velocity obtained from a lubrication study of a nearly spherical
drop, which describes the role of the squeezing flow within the bubble-wall
gap. The numerical and lubrication analyses consistently demonstrate that when
$\varepsilon\leq 1$, the lubrication effect makes the migration velocity
asymptotically $\mu V_{B1}^2/(25\varepsilon \gamma)$ (here, $V_{B1}$, $\mu$,

the microscopic rates governing particle motion are of quantum-mechanical
origin. We here employ the stochastic path integral approach as an optimal tool
to probe the fluctuation statistics in such applications. Describing the
classical limit of the Keldysh quantum nonequilibrium field theory, the
stochastic path integral encapsulates the quantum origin of microscopic
particle exchange rates. Dynamically, it is equivalent to a transport master
equation which is a formalism general enough to describe many applications of
practical interest. We apply the stochastic path integral to derive general
functional fluctuation relations for current flow induced by time-varying
forces. We show that the successive measurement processes implied by this setup
do not put the derivation of quantum fluctuation relations in jeopardy. While
in many cases the fluctuation relation for a full time-dependent current
profile may contain excessive information, we formulate a number of reduced
relations, and demonstrate their application to mesoscopic transport. Examples
include the distribution of transmitted charge, where we show that the
derivation of a fluctuation relation requires the combined monitoring of the
statistics of charge and work.

quadrupole and octopole. The alignment between these multipoles is studied by
using a symmetry based approach which assigns a principal eigenvector (PEV) or
an axis with each multipole. We determine the significance of alignment between
these multipoles by using the Internal Linear Combination (ILC) 5 and 7 year
map s and also the maps obtained by using the Internal Power Spectrum
Estimation (IPSE) procedure. The effect of foreground cleaning is studied in
detail within the framework of the IPSE method both analytically and
numerically. By using simulated CMBR data, we study how the PEVs of the pure
simulated CMB map differ from those of the final cleaned map. We find that, in
general, the shift in the PEVs is relatively small and in random directions.
Due to the random nature of the shift we conclude that it can only lead to
misalignment rather than alignment of multipoles. We also directly estimate the
significance of alignment by using simulated cleaned maps. We find that the
results in this case are identical to those obtained by simple analytic
estimate or by using simulated pure CMB maps.

described in terms of directed paths (causal flows) on a discrete state space.
Such a set of paths defines a feed-forward, acyclic network. A key problem
associated with these systems involves characterizing their intrinsic degree of
path reversibility: given an end node in the graph, what is the uncertainty of
recovering the process backwards until the origin? Here we propose a novel
concept, \textit{topological reversibility}, which rigorously weigths such
uncertainty in path dependency quantified as the minimum amount of information
required to successfully revert a causal path. Within the proposed framework we
also analytically characterize limit cases for both topologically reversible

presented. 3D Eulerian multiphase chemistry-transport model TCAM is employed
for simulating AOD at mesoscale. MODIS satellite sensor and AERONET photometer
AOD are used for comparing spatial patterns and temporal timeseries. TCAM
simulations for year 2004 over a domain containing Po-Valley and nearly whole
Northern Italy are employed. For the computation of AOD, a configuration of
external mixing of the chemical species is considered. Furthermore, a
parametrization of the effect of moisture affecting both aerosol size and
composition is used. An analysis of the contributions of the granulometric
classes to the extinction coefficient reveals the dominant role of the
inorganic compounds of submicron size. For the analysis of spatial patterns,
summer and winter case study are considered. TCAM AOD reproduces spatial
patterns similar to those retrieved from space, but AOD values are generally
smaller by an order of magnitude. However, accounting also for moisture, TCAM
AOD significantly increases to values of the same magnitude of the observed
ones. The temporal performance of model AOD is tested in correspondence of
AERONET site ""Venise"" and some temporal structures are reproduced. The results
suggest encouraging perspectives in view of satellite AOD assimilation also at
the mesoscale and not only at the global and regional scale as already tested
in the literature.

6.7-GHz masers; regions traced by the high-luminosity masers have larger column

Further, strong correlations between 6.7-GHz maser luminosity and NH3(1,1) and

cross-matched with the Spitzer/MIPS and GALEX catalogues. About 60 % of the
Herschel sources are detected in UV. The total IR luminosities, L_IR, of the
sources are estimated using a SED-fitting code that fits to fluxes between 24
and 500 micron. Dust attenuation is discussed on the basis of commonly-used
diagnostics: the L_IR/L_UV ratio and the slope, beta, of the UV continuum. A
mean dust attenuation A_UV of ~ 3 mag is measured in the samples. L_IR/L_UV is
found to correlate with L_IR. Galaxies with L_IR > 10 ^{11} L_sun and 0.5< z<1
exhibit a mean dust attenuation A_UV about 0.7 mag lower than that found for
their local counterparts, although with a large dispersion. Our galaxy samples
span a large range of beta and L_IR/L_UV values which, for the most part, are
distributed between the ranges defined by the relations found locally for
starburst and normal star-forming galaxies. As a consequence the recipe
commonly applied to local starbursts is found to overestimate the dust
attenuation correction in our galaxy sample by a factor ~2-3 .

characterize the probability density function of gravitational force

the underlying density field. In addition, we study whether the PDF converges
to an asymptotic shape within sample volumes. We consider several
volume-limited samples of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and we compute the
gravitational force probability density function (PDF). The gravitational force
is computed in spheres of varying radius as is its PDF. We find that (i) the
PDF of the force displays features that can be understood in terms of galaxy
two-point correlations and (ii) density fluctuations on the largest scales
probed, i.e. r~100 Mpc/h, still contribute significantly to the amplitude of
the gravitational force. Our main conclusion is that fluctuations in the
gravitational force field generated by galaxy structures are also relevant on
scales ~ 100 Mpc/h. By assuming that the gravitational fluctuations in the
galaxy distribution reflect those in the whole matter distribution, and that
peculiar velocities and accelerations are simply correlated, we may conclude
that large-scale fluctuations in the galaxy density field may be the source of
the large-scale flows recently observed.

regime required to measure the gravitomagnetic effect (Lense Thirring) of the
Earth. For an ensemble of linearly independent gyros each measurement signal
depends upon the orientation of each single axis gyro with respect to the
rotational axis of the Earth. Therefore at least 3 gyros are necessary to
reconstruct the complete angular orientation of the apparatus. In general, the
setup consists of several laser gyroscopes (we would prefer more than 3 for
sufficient redundancy), rigidly referenced to each other. Adding more gyros for
one plane of observation provides a cross-check against intra-system biases and
furthermore has the advantage of improving the signal to noise ratio by the
square root of the number of gyros. In this paper we analyze a system of two
pairs of identical gyros (twins) with a slightly different orientation with
respect to the Earth axis. The twin gyro configuration has several interesting
properties. The relative angle can be controlled and provides a useful null
measurement. A quadruple twin system could reach a 1% sensitivity after 3:2

resistive network and an inductive-resistive one. The presented devices can be
considered as distributed versions of the well-known resistive and resonant
shunt of a single piezoelectric transducer. The technicalfeasibility and
damping effectiveness of the proposed novel devices are assessed through the
construction of an experimental prototype. Experimental results are shown to be
in very good agreement with theoretical predictions. It is proved that the
presented technique allows for a substantial reduction in the inductances used
when compared with those required by the single resonant shunted transducer. In
particular, it is shown that the required inductance decreases when the number
of piezoelectric elements is increased. The electric networks are optimized in
order to reduce forced vibrations close to the first resonance frequency.
Nevertheless, the damping effectiveness for higher modes is experimentally
proved. As well as specific results, fundamental theoretical and experimental

against the continuum source Sgr~B2(M) using the \textit{Herschel}/HIFI
instrument. With the high spectral resolution and wide velocity coverage
provided by HIFI, 31 CH absorption features with different radial velocities
and line widths are detected and identified. The narrower line width and lower
column density clouds show `spiral arm' cloud characteristics, while the
absorption component with the broadest line width and highest column density
corresponds to the gas from the Sgr~B2 envelope. The observations show that
each `spiral arm' harbors multiple velocity components, indicating that the
clouds are not uniform and that they have internal structure. This
line-of-sight through almost the entire Galaxy offers unique possibilities to
study the basic chemistry of simple molecules in diffuse clouds, as a variety
of different cloud classes are sampled simultaneously. We find that the linear
relationship between CH and H$_2$ column densities found at lower $A_V$ by UV
observations does not continue into the range of higher visual extinction.
There, the curve flattens, which probably means that CH is depleted in the
denser cores of these clouds.

new physics must lie below 260 GeV sqrt{tan beta}. The effect is universal in
the B_s and B_d systems, leading to S_{psi K}~sin(2beta)-0.15 and S_{psi

negligible. The most plausible mechanism is tree-level scalar exchange. MFV
supersymmetry with low tan beta will be excluded. Finally, we explain how a
pattern of deviations from the Standard Model predictions for S_{psi phi},
S_{psi K} and epsilon_K can be used to test MFV and, if MFV holds, to probe its

jet phenomena. Prominent sources of such highly relativistic outflows are
pulsar winds and Active Galactic Nuclei. The current understanding of these
jets assumes diluted plasmas which are best described as kinetic phenomena. In
this kinetic description particle acceleration to ultra-relativistic speeds can
occur in completely unmagnetized and neutral plasmas through insetting effects
of instabilities. Even though the morphology and nature of particle spectra are
understood to a certain extent, the composition of the jets is not known yet.
While Poynting-flux dominated jets are certainly composed of electron-positron
plasmas, the understanding of the governing physics in AGN jets is mostly
unclear. In this article we investigate how the constituting elements of an
electron-positron-proton plasma behave differently under the variation of the
fundamental mass-ratio m_p/m_e. We studied initially unmagnetized
counterstreaming plasmas using fully relativistic three-dimensional
particle-in-cell simulations to investigate the influence of the mass-ratio on
particle acceleration and magnetic field generation in electron-positron-proton
plasmas. We covered a range of mass-ratios m_p/m_e between 1 and 100 with a
particle number composition of n_{p^+}/n_{e^+} of 1 in one stream, only protons
are injected in the other, whereas electrons are present in both to guarantee
charge neutrality in the simulation box. We find that with increasing proton
mass the instability takes longer to develop and for mass-ratios > 20 the
particles seem to be accelerated in two phases which can be accounted to the
individual instabilities of the different species. This means that for high
mass ratios the coupling between electrons/positrons and the heavier protons,
which occurs in low mass-ratios, disappears.

to gain insight into the progenitor systems of these SNe.
  We implement a NLTE treatment of hydrogen and helium in a three-dimensional
nebular code. Ionisation, recombination, (non-)thermal electron excitation and
H$\alpha$ line scattering are taken into account to compute the formation of
H$\alpha$, which is by far the strongest H line observed in the nebular spectra
of SNe IIb. Other lines of H and He are also computed but are rarely identified
in the nebular phase. Nebular models are computed for the Type IIb SNe 1993J,
2001ig, 2003bg and 2008ax as well as for SN 2007Y, which shows H$\alpha$
absorption features at early times and strong H$\alpha$ emission in its late
phase, but has been classified as a SN Ib. We suggest to classify SN 2007Y as a
SN IIb. Optical spectra exist for all SNe of our sample, and there is one IR
nebular observation of SN 2008ax, which allows an exploration of its helium
mass and distribution.
  We develop a three-dimensional model for SN 2008ax. We obtain estimates for
the total mass and kinetic energy in good agreement with the results from
light-curve modelling found in the literature. We further derive abundances of
He, C, O, Ca and $^{56}$Ni. We demonstrate that H$\alpha$ absorption is
probably responsible for the double-peaked profile of the [O {\sc i}]

preservation of non-trivial distinct D4 subgroups in the charged lepton and

undetermined and is expected to be of order one. Since right-handed charged
leptons transform as singlets under D4, the charged lepton mass hierarchy can
be naturally accounted for. The model predicts inverted mass hierarchy for

the evolution is determined by the ratio of the horizontal and vertical

sheet length scale is formed. After a timespan greater than the Cowling

of the ratio of the field strengths. These results imply that when Cowling
resistivity is included in the model, the tearing instability time scale is
reduced by more than one order of magnitude when the ratio of the horizontal
field to the vertical field is 20\% or less. These results imply that, over the
course of its lifetime, the structure of the prominence can be significantly
altered by Cowling resistivity, and in some cases will allow the tearing

be suppressed at large x, but significantly enhanced at x<<1. This is a high
twist effect. In the case of nucleus-nucleus collisions all participating
nucleons on both sides get enriched in gluon density at small x, which leads to
a further boosting of the saturation scale. We derive reciprocity equations for
the saturation scales corresponding to a collision of two nuclei. The solution
of these equations for central collisions of two heavy nuclei demonstrate a
significant, up to several times, enhancement of Q_{sA}^2, in AA compared with

to describe the Bose condensate at low density, to describe the crossover from

should use some fermionic effective model of QCD, such as the
Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. In this paper, using two-color two-flavor QCD as an
example, we examine how the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model describes the weakly
interacting Bose condensate at low density and the BEC-BCS crossover at
moderate density. Near the quantum phase transition point $\mu_{\text B}=m_\pi$
($m_\pi$ is the mass of pion/diquark multiplet), the Ginzburg-Landau free
energy at the mean-field level can be reduced to the Gross-Pitaevskii free
energy describing a weakly repulsive Bose condensate with a diquark-diquark
scattering length identical to that predicted by the chiral perturbation
theories. The Goldstone mode recovers the Bogoliubov excitation in weakly
interacting Bose condensates. The results of in-medium chiral and diquark
condensates predicted by chiral perturbation theories are analytically
recovered. The BEC-BCS crossover and meson Mott transition at moderate baryon
chemical potential as well as the beyond-mean-field corrections are studied.
Part of our results can also be applied to real QCD at finite baryon or isospin

clusters of galaxies, like the bullet cluster (1E 0657-56) and baby bullet
(MACSJ0025-12). These systems provide evidence for an additional, invisible
mass in the separation between the distribution of their total mass, measured
via gravitational lensing, and their ordinary 'baryonic' matter, measured via
its X-ray emission. Unfortunately, the information available from these systems
is limited by their rarity. Constraints on the properties of dark matter, such
as its interaction cross-section, are therefore restricted by uncertainties in
the individual systems' impact velocity, impact parameter and orientation with
respect to the line of sight.
  Here we develop a complementary, statistical measurement in which every piece
of substructure falling into every massive cluster is treated as a bullet. We
define 'bulleticity' as the mean separation between dark matter and ordinary
matter, and we measure the signal in hydrodynamical simulations. The phase
space of substructure orbits also exhibits symmetries that provide an
equivalent control test.
  Any detection of bulleticity in real data would indicate a difference in the
interaction cross-sections of baryonic and dark matter that may rule out
hypotheses of non-particulate dark matter that are otherwise able to model
individual systems. A subsequent measurement of bulleticity could constrain the
dark matter cross-section. Even with conservative estimates, the existing HST
archive should yield an independent constraint tighter than that from the
bullet cluster. This technique is then trivially extendable to, and benefits
enormously from larger, future surveys.

then taken into account for its dynamical feedback on the shock structure as

centers that enters the particle transport equation. The spectra of accelerated

if the magnetic field is sufficiently amplified and the scattering centers have
high speed in the frame of the background plasma. We discuss the implications

in protein levels across a population of cells. To explain this variability,
different sources of mRNA fluctuations ('Poisson' and 'Telegraph' processes)
have been proposed in stochastic models of gene expression. Both Poisson and
Telegraph scenario models explain experimental observations of noise in protein
levels in terms of 'bursts' of protein expression. Correspondingly, there is
considerable interest in establishing relations between burst and steady-state
protein distributions for general stochastic models of gene expression. In this
work, we address this issue by considering a mapping between stochastic models
of gene expression and problems of interest in queueing theory. By applying a
general theorem from queueing theory, Little's Law, we derive exact relations
which connect burst and steady-state distribution means for models with
arbitrary waiting-time distributions for arrival and degradation of mRNAs and
proteins. The derived relations have implications for approaches to quantify
the degree of transcriptional bursting and hence to discriminate between
different sources of intrinsic noise in gene expression. To illustrate this, we
consider a model for regulation of protein expression bursts by small RNAs. For
a broad range of parameters, we derive analytical expressions (validated by
stochastic simulations) for the mean protein levels as the levels of regulatory
small RNAs are varied. The results obtained show that the degree of
transcriptional bursting can, in principle, be determined from changes in mean
steady-state protein levels for general stochastic models of gene expression.
