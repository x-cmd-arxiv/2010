contexts, notably in suspensions of colloidal particles to which much smaller
particles have been added in the form of polymers or nanoparticles.
Conventional schemes for simulating models of such systems are hamstrung by the
difficulty of relaxing the large species in the presence of the small one. Here
we describe how the rejection-free geometrical cluster algorithm (GCA) of Liu
and Luijten [Phys. Rev. Lett 92, 035504 (2004)] can be embedded within a
restricted Gibbs ensemble to facilitate efficient and accurate studies of fluid
phase behavior of highly size-asymmetrical mixtures. After providing a detailed
description of the algorithm, we summarize the bespoke analysis techniques of
Ashton et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 132, 074111 (2010)] that permit accurate
estimates of coexisting densities and critical-point parameters. We apply our
methods to study the liquid--vapor phase diagram of a particular mixture of
Lennard-Jones particles having a 10:1 size ratio. As the reservoir volume
fraction of small particles is increased in the range 0--5%, the critical
temperature decreases by approximately 50%, while the critical density drops by
some 30%. These trends imply that in our system, adding small particles
decreases the net attraction between large particles, a situation that
contrasts with hard-sphere mixtures where an attractive depletion force occurs.

all-electron approaches. We show that the equilibrium lattice parameter agrees
with experiment to within 0.03 %, which is around the experimental uncertainty,
and the cohesive energy agrees to within around 10 meV per formula unit. QMC in
periodic slab geometry is used to compute the formation energy of the LiH (001)

slab thickness and other technical parameters. The quantum chemistry
calculations build on the recently developed hierarchical scheme for computing
the correlation energy of a crystal to high precision. We show that the
hierarchical scheme allows the accurate calculation of the surface formation
energy, and we present results that are well converged with respect to basis

observational coverage and detailed modeling, fundamental information about the
shock breakout, such as the radius of breakout and driver of the light curve

jet-driven supernova simulations from stripped-envelope progenitors and

X-ray spectra evolve significantly in time as the shocks expand outward and are
not well-fit by single-temperature and radius black bodies. The time scale of
the X-ray burst light curve of the shock breakout is related to the shock

long shock breakout light curve time scale observed for XRO 080109/SN 2008D.

winds emanating from within the pulsar light cylinder. Their radiative
dissipation in various wavebands is significantly different from that of their
pulsar central engines: the broadband spectra of PWNe possess characteristics
distinct from those of pulsars, thereby demanding a site of lepton acceleration
remote from the pulsar magnetosphere. A principal candidate for this locale is
the pulsar wind termination shock, a putatively highly-oblique,
ultra-relativistic MHD discontinuity. This paper summarizes key characteristics
of relativistic shock acceleration germane to PWNe, using predominantly Monte
Carlo simulation techniques that compare well with semi-analytic solutions of
the diffusion-convection equation. The array of potential spectral indices for
the pair distribution function is explored, defining how these depend
critically on the parameters of the turbulent plasma in the shock environs.
Injection efficiencies into the acceleration process are also addressed.
Informative constraints on the frequency of particle scattering and the level
of field turbulence are identified using the multiwavelength observations of
selected PWNe. These suggest that the termination shock can be comfortably
invoked as a principal injector of energetic leptons into PWNe without
resorting to unrealistic properties for the shock layer turbulence or MHD
structure.

network and is resilient to random link failures. For networks with reliable
communication (i.e., no failures,) the simplified, AL-BG (augmented Lagrangian
broadcast gossiping) algorithm reduces communication, computation and data
storage cost. We prove convergence for all proposed algorithms and demonstrate
by simulations the effectiveness on two applications: l_1-regularized logistic
regression for classification and cooperative spectrum sensing for cognitive
radio networks.

denoted ""Tailor Based Allocations (TBA)"" for multiple authorship. Several
protocols to TBA are suggested. The choice of a specific TBA may vary from one
discipline to another. In addition, TBA is applied to the number of citations
of a multiple author paper to have also this number conserved. Each author gets
only a specific fraction of the total number of citations according to its
fractional paper allocation. The equivalent of the h-index obtained by using
TBA is denoted the gh-index. It yields values which differ drastically from
those given by the h-index. The gh-index departs also from the `h-index
recently proposed by Hirsh to account for multiple authorship. Contrary to the
h-index, the gh-index is a function of the total number of citations of each
paper. A highly cited paper allows a better allocation for all co-authors while
a less cited paper contributes essentially to one or two of the co-authors. The
scheme produces a substantial redistribution of the ranking of scientists in
terms of quantitative records. A few illustrations are provided.

self-assembling systems. We interpret a well-studied abstraction of
nanomolecular self assembly, the Abstract Tile Assembly Model (aTAM), into
Computation Tree Logic (CTL), a temporal logic often used in model checking. We
then consider the class of ""rectilinear"" tile assembly systems. This class
includes most aTAM systems studied in the theoretical literature, and all
(algorithmic) DNA tile self-assembling systems that have been realized in
laboratories to date. We present a polynomial-time algorithm that, given a tile
assembly system T as input, either provides a counterexample to T's
rectilinearity or verifies whether T has a unique terminal assembly. Using
partial order reductions, the verification search space for this algorithm is
reduced from exponential size to O(n^2), where n x n is the size of the
assembly surface. That reduction is asymptotically the best possible. We report
on experimental results obtained by translating tile assembly simulator files
into a Petri net format manipulable by the SMART model checking engines devised
by Ciardo et al. The model checker runs in O(|T| x n^4) time, where |T| is the
number of tile types in tile assembly system T, and n x n is the surface size.
Atypical for a model checking problem -- in which the practical limit usually
is insufficient memory to store the state space -- the limit in this case was
the amount of memory required to represent the rules of the model. (Storage of
the state space and of the reachability graph were small by comparison.) We
discuss how to overcome this obstacle by means of a front end tailored to the
characteristics of self-assembly.

Similarly, transport across the barriers can occur via electrons as well as via

70 million Monte Carlo models selected to match the properties (metallicity,
ages and masses) of stellar clusters found in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC).
This database shows the rather extreme and non-Guassian distribution of
integrated colors and magnitudes expected with different cluster age and mass
and the enormous age degeneracy of integrated colors when mass is unknown. This
degeneracy could lead to catastrophic failures in estimating age with standard
SSP models, particularly if most of the clusters are of intermediate or low
mass, like in the LMC. Utilizing the MASSCLEANcolors database, we have
developed MASSCLEANage, a statistical inference package which assigns the most
likely age and mass (solved simultaneously) to a cluster based only on its
integrated broad-band photometric properties. Finally, we use MASSCLEANage to
derive the age and mass of LMC clusters based on integrated photometry alone.
First we compare our cluster ages against those obtained for the same seven
clusters using more accurate integrated spectroscopy. We find improved
agreement with the integrated spectroscopy ages over the original photometric
ages. A close examination of our results demonstrate the necessity of solving
simultaneously for mass and age to reduce degeneracies in the cluster ages
derived via integrated colors. We then selected an additional subset of 30
photometric clusters with previously well constrained ages and independently
derive their age using the MASSCLEANage with the same photometry with very good
agreement. The MASSCLEANage program is freely available under GNU General

inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements on BaFe1.85Co0.15As2 and
BaFe1.91Ni0.09As2 samples that exhibit neither static magnetic phases nor
structural phase transitions. In both the normal and superconducting (SC)
states, the spectrum lacks the 42/m screw symmetry around the (1/2 1/2 L) axis
that is implied by the I4/mmm space group. This is manifest both in the
in-plane anisotropy of the normal- and SC-state spin dynamics and in the
out-of-plane dispersion of the spin-resonance mode. We show that this effect
originates from the higher symmetry of the magnetic Fe sublattice with respect
to the crystal itself, hence the INS signal inherits the symmetry of the
unfolded Brillouin zone (BZ) of the Fe sublattice. The in-plane anisotropy is
temperature-independent and can be qualitatively reproduced in normal-state
density-functional-theory calculations without invoking a symmetry-broken
(""nematic"") ground state that was previously proposed as an explanation for
this effect. Below the SC transition, the energy of the magnetic resonant mode
Er, as well as its intensity and the SC spin gap inherit the normal-state
intensity modulation along the out-of-plane direction L with a period twice
larger than expected from the body-centered-tetragonal BZ symmetry. The
amplitude of this modulation decreases at higher doping, providing an analogy
to the splitting between even and odd resonant modes in bilayer cuprates.
Combining our and previous data, we show that at odd L a universal linear
relationship Er=4.3*kB*Tc holds for all studied Fe-based superconductors,
independent of their carrier type. Its validity down to the lowest doping
levels is consistent with weaker electron correlations in ferropnictides as
compared to the underdoped cuprates.

subjected to a critique that reveals two crucial aspects that have so far not
been properly taken into account. These are (i) the correct understanding of
the notions of sufficiency, completeness and redundancy involved; and (ii) the
fact that the apparatus settings and measurement outcomes have very different
theoretical roles in the candidate theories under study. Both aspects are not
adequately incorporated in the standard formalisation, and we will therefore do
so. The upshot of our analysis is a more detailed, sharp and clean mathematical
expression of the condition of local causality. A preliminary analysis of the
repercussions of our proposal shows that it is able to locate exactly where and
how the notions of locality and causality are involved in formalising Bell's

GPU by factors up to 35 compared to an optimized single Central Processor Unit
(CPU) core implementation which employs multi-spin coding. By combining the

low mass companions, including a candidate brown dwarf, are found at relatively
large separations. We find that the close-binary separation distribution is
strongly peaked towards < 30AU separations. There is marginally significant
evidence for a change in high-order M-dwarf multiplicity with binding energy

high-order-multiple fraction for the widest targets in our survey, with a
high-order-multiple fraction of 21% (+17%/-7%) for systems with separations up

on the statistical properties of two major Galactic foregrounds that arise from

how we can make use of our findings to remove Galactic foregrounds using a

spatial filtering of a foreground at small scales, when the separation into CMB
signal and foregrounds is done at larger scales. We demonstrate that the new
technique of spatial filtering of foregrounds may be promising for recovering
the CMB signal in a situation when foregrounds are known at a scale different

significantly larger than that reported by the Burst and Transient Explorer
(BATSE), suggesting a relatively small flux in the 3 - 30 MeV energy range. The
present-day energy input rate in $\gamma$-rays recorded by the GBM from long

W(0)=0.5 F_{\gamma} H/c = 5 \times 10^{42}\ \rm{erg/Mpc^3 yr}$. The Large Area
Telescope (LAT) fluence, when observed, is about 5-10\% per decade of the
total, in good agreement with the predictions of saturated, non-linear shock
acceleration.
  The high-energy component of long GRBs, as measured by Fermi, is found to
contain only $\sim 10^{-2.5}$ of the energy needed to produce ultrahigh-energy
cosmic rays (UHECR) above 4 Eev, assuming the latter to be extragalactic, when
various numerical factors are carefully included, if the cosmic ray source
spectrum has a spectral index of -2. The observed $\gamma$-ray fraction of the
required UHECR energy is even smaller if the source spectrum is softer than
$E^{-2}$.
  The AMANDA II limits rule out such a GRB origin for UHECR if much more than
$10^{-2}$ of the cosmic ray energy goes into neutrinos that are within, and
simultaneous with, the $\gamma$-ray beam.
  It is suggested that ""orphan"" neutrinos out of the $\gamma$-ray beam might be
identifiable via orphan afterglow { or other wide angle signatures of GRB in
lieu of coincidence with prompt $\gamma$-rays}, and it is recommended that

uncertainties in the normalization and slope of the mass-metallicity relation,
we show that the metal expulsion efficiency zetaw=(Zw/Zg)etaw (where Zw is the
wind metallicitiy and Zg is the interstellar medium metallicity) must be both
high and scale steeply with mass. Specifically, we show that zetaw >> 1 and
zetaw proportional to vvir^-3 or steeper. In contrast, momentum- or

for WIMPs requires the capability to detect the recoiling nuclei that result
when these particles interact with normal matter. In order to make meaningful
statements about an observed signal, or lack thereof, the energy scale of
recoiling nuclei in LXe must be known. Our understanding of this energy scale
is contained in a quantity called the relative scintillation efficiency of
nuclear recoils, or L_eff, and has been studied extensively in the literature,
producing seemingly contradictory results. I examine all the measurements of
L_eff that exist, both direct and indirect, and extract the energy dependent
behavior that is statistically consistent globally with all values.
Additionally, I examine the measurements covering low energies (>~10 keV, where
the largest disagreements exist) and attempt to diagnose the systematic effects
that have led to the observed inconsistencies. I show that virtually all major
disparity arises due to efficiency roll-off of the detectors at the low
energies, and, when taking this into account, find that the observed behavior
of L_eff supports a slowly and smoothly decreasing value with decreasing
energy. Finally, I discuss the prospects for future measurements, and derive a

the model disprovable if a positive signal is found. The same bounds still
allow for a sizable positive contribution to $\epsilon_K$, while the CP
violation in the $B_s$ mixing turns out to be too small to account for the
di-muon anomaly reported by the D0 collaboration. Finally, the regions where
the neutralino relic density is within the WMAP bounds can be strongly modified

events in live or recorded surveillance video streams. The approach for event
recognition in VERSA is using a declarative logic language to define the
spatial and temporal relationships that characterize a given event or activity.
Doing so requires the definition of certain fundamental spatial and temporal
relationships and a high-level syntax for specifying frame templates and query
parameters. Although the handling of uncertainty in the current VERSA
implementation is simplistic, the language and architecture is amenable to
extending using Fuzzy Logic or similar approaches. VERSA's high-level
architecture is designed to work in XML-based, services- oriented environments.
VERSA can be thought of as subscribing to the XML annotations streamed by a
lower-level video analytics service that provides basic entity detection,
labeling, and tracking. One or many VERSA Event Monitors could thus analyze
video streams and provide alerts when certain events are detected.

applications including fluid dynamics, the Whitham averaging procedure and the
theory of Frobenius manifolds. In 1+1 dimensions, the requirement of the
integrability of such systems by the generalised hodograph transform implies
that integrable Hamiltonians depend on a certain number of arbitrary functions
of two variables. On the contrary, in 2+1 dimensions the requirement of the
integrability by the method of hydrodynamic reductions, which is a natural
analogue of the generalised hodograph transform in higher dimensions, leads to
finite-dimensional moduli spaces of integrable Hamiltonians. In this paper we
classify integrable two-component Hamiltonian systems of hydrodynamic type for
all existing classes of differential-geometric Poisson brackets in 2D,
establishing a parametrisation of integrable Hamiltonians via
elliptic/hypergeometric functions. Our approach is based on the Godunov-type
representation of Hamiltonian systems, and utilises a novel construction of

functions (CF's) of system operators of a pure-dephasing spin-boson model in
two different ways, one by the direct exact operator technique and the other by
the recently derived evolution equations, valid to second order in the
system-environment interaction Hamiltonian. This pure-dephasing spin-boson
model that is exactly solvable has been extensively studied as a simple
decoherence model. However, its exact non-Markovian finite-temperature two-time
system operator CF's, to our knowledge, have not been presented in the
literature. This may be mainly due to the fact, illustrated in this article,
that in contrast to the Markovian case, the time evolution of the reduced
density matrix of the system (or the reduced quantum master equation) alone is
not sufficient to calculate the two-time system operator CF's of non-Markovian
open systems. The two-time CF's obtained using the recently derived evolution
equations in the weak system-environment coupling case for this non-Markovian
pure-dephasing model happen to be the same as those obtained from the exact
evaluation. However, these results significantly differ from the non-Markovian
two-time CF's obtained by wrongly directly applying the quantum regression
theorem (QRT), a useful procedure to calculate the two-time CF's for
weak-coupling Markovian open systems. This demonstrates clearly that the
recently derived evolution equations generalize correctly the QRT to
non-Markovian finite-temperature cases. It is believed that these evolution
equations will have applications in many different branches of physics.

are applied to derive various partial differential equations (PDE) satisfied by
joint eigenvalue spacing probabilities of two coupled Gaussian Hermitian
matrices (coupled GUE). All the lowest (third) order PDE satisfied by the
probabilities for the largest eigenvalues of two coupled GUE are found, and the
results of both approaches are compared. The TW approach allows to derive all
PDE at once, while in the ASvM one starting with different bilinear identities
leads to different subsets of the full set of equations. An interesting result
is that the joint probability for the largest eigenvalues of coupled Gaussian
matrices satisfies a number of different PDE, and the previously known
Adler-van Moerbeke equation (AvM) [3] is only one of them. Some of the new
equations look like ""coupled Painlev\'e IV"" and have usual Painlev\'e IV
equation as one-matrix limit, i.e. when the spectral endpoint of one of the
matrices goes to infinity. This is in contrast to the AvM equation, which
becomes trivial in this limit. Moreover, the new PDE, which stem from the
matrix kernel approach of [23], do not contain derivatives w.r.t. the strength
of coupling, unlike the AvM equation. In other words, they contain fewer
independent variables and in this sense are simpler.

find this approximation does not hold even approximately. In the Part 2 of the
subsequent paper, we apply the results from Figures 12, 13 and 14 to L/E
analysis and conclude that one cannot obtain the maximum oscillation in L/E
analysis which shows strongly the oscillation pattern from the neutrino
oscillation.

of mass proxies for future X-ray missions, including eROSITA. We use a sample
of 12 clusters at z\simeq0.2 that we have observed with Subaru and XMM-Newton
to construct relationships between the weak-lensing mass (M), and three X-ray
observables: gas temperature (T), gas mass (Mgas), and quasi-integrated gas
pressure (Yx) at overdensities of \Delta=2500, 1000, and 500 with respect to
the critical density. We find that Mgas at \Delta\le1000 appears to be the most
promising mass proxy of the three, because it has the lowest intrinsic scatter
in mass at fixed observable: \sigma_lnM\simeq0.1, independent of cluster
dynamical state. The scatter in mass at fixed T and Yx is a factor of \sim2-3
larger than at fixed Mgas, which are indicative of the structural segregation
that we find in the M-T and M-Yx relationships. Undisturbed clusters are found
to be \sim40% and \sim20% more massive than disturbed clusters at fixed T and
Yx respectively at \sim2\sigma significance. In particular, A1914 - a
well-known merging cluster - significantly increases the scatter and lowers the
the normalization of the relation for disturbed clusters. We also investigated
the covariance between intrinsic scatter in M-Mgas and M-T relations, finding
that they are positively correlated. This contradicts the adaptive mesh
refinement simulations that motivated the idea that Yx may be a low scatter
mass proxy, and agrees with more recent smoothed particle hydrodynamic
simulations based on the Millennium Simulation. We also propose a method to
identify a robust mass proxy based on principal component analysis. The
statistical precision of our results are limited by the small sample size and
the presence of the extreme merging cluster in our sample.

susceptibility measurements on bulk La0.65Ca0.35Mn1-yFeyO3 with 0.01<y<0.10 as
functions of temperature and dc field. It is observed that the in phase part
goes through a maximum that is removed on the application of moderate dc field.
DC fields suppress both the components with the strongest effects being at or
close to Tc. Conduction and ferromagnetism has been consistently suppressed by
Fe doping. Increased spin disorder and decrease of Tc with increasing Fe
content are evident. The variations in the critical temperature Tc and magnetic
moment show a rapid change at about 4-5% Fe. The effect of Fe is seen to be
consistent with the disruption of the Mn-Mn exchange possibly due to the
formation of magnetic clusters. There is clear correlation between the
structures in the resistivity and the in and out of phase parts of the
susceptibility. With increasing Fe concentration the out of phase part (x'')
peak shift to T<T1/2, but it stays consistently at the temperature where the
resistivity changes slow down. The shoulder in x'' disappears above 4% Fe
concentration. The peak of x'' moves to 8 or 10 K higher temperature on the
application of a dc field, for 3 & 4 %Fe samples. Consistently two peaks are
found in the ratios of x''/x'. We are seeing correspondence of dissipation with
the change in R. We also see increasing low temperature dissipation in more
strongly Fe doped samples i.e. increasing the Fe, leads to increased spin
disorder and dissipation at low temperature. The effect of the dc field is
discussed in terms of the suppression of spin fluctuations close to Tc and the
changes in coercivity for lower temperatures.

Gyr for most of the sample no matter the constant or varying dust extinction is
adopted, which are similar to most of the previous studies on smaller samples.
This means that these LSBGs formed their majority of stars quite recently.
However, a small part of the sample (~2-3%) have larger ages as 5-8 Gyr,
meaning their major star forming process may occur earlier. At the same time, a
large sample (5,886) of high surface brightness galaxies (HSBGs) are selected

could mean that the HSBGs may have more recent star forming activities than the

64 galaxies for which M_bh measurements (not just upper limits) are available.
Due to new and increased black hole masses at the high-mass end, and a better
representation of barred galaxies at the low-mass end, the ""classical"" (all
morphological type) M_bh-sigma relation for predicting black hole masses is
log(M_bh/M_Sun) = (5.13+/-0.34)log[sigma/200] + (8.13+/-0.05), with an rms
scatter of 0.43 dex. Modifying the regression analysis to correct for a
hitherto over-looked sample bias in which black holes with masses <10^6 M_Sun
are not (yet) detectable, the relation steepens further to give log(M_bh/M_Sun)
= (5.95+/-0.44)log[sigma/200] + (8.15+/-0.06). We have also updated the
""barless"" and ""elliptical-only"" M_bh-sigma relations introduced by Graham and
Hu in 2008 due to the offset nature of barred/disc galaxies. These relations
have a total scatter as low as 0.34 dex and currently define the upper envelope
of points in the M_bh-sigma diagram. These relations also have a slope
consistent with the value 5, in agreement with the prediction by Silk & Rees
based on feedback from massive black holes in bulges built by
monolithic-collapse.
  Using updated virial products and velocity dispersions from 28 active
galactic nuclei, we determine that the optimal scaling factor f - which brings
their virial products in line with the 64 directly measured black hole masses -
is 2.8^{+0.7}_{-0.5}. This is roughly half the value reported by Onken et al.
and Woo et al., and consequently halves the mass estimates of most
high-redshift quasars. We have explored the results after separating the
samples into barred and non-barred galaxies, and we have also developed a
preliminary corrective term to the velocity dispersion based on bar dynamics.

closely related to a matrix model describing topological Chern-Simons theory on
a lens space. We explore further these recent observations and extract more
exact results in ABJM theory from the matrix model. In particular we calculate
the planar free energy, which matches at strong coupling the classical IIA
supergravity action on AdS_4 x CP^3 and gives the correct N^{3/2} scaling for
the number of degrees of freedom of the M2 brane theory. Furthermore we find
contributions coming from world-sheet instanton corrections in CP^3. We also
calculate non-planar corrections, both to the free energy and to the Wilson
loop expectation values. This matrix model appears also in the study of
topological strings on a toric Calabi-Yau manifold, and an intriguing
connection arises between the space of couplings of the planar ABJM theory and
the moduli space of this Calabi-Yau. In particular it suggests that, in
addition to the usual perturbative and strong coupling (AdS) expansions, a
third natural expansion locus is the line where one of the two 't Hooft
couplings vanishes and the other is finite. This is the conifold locus of the
Calabi-Yau, and leads to an expansion around topological Chern-Simons theory.
We present some explicit results for the partition function and Wilson loop
observables around this locus.

orbital period of about 5.6 hours. The binary is viewed almost edge-on at a
high inclination angle of 83 degrees, which makes it a unique candidate to
study binary orbital and accretion disk dynamics in high powered X-ray sources.
We observed the X-ray source in 4U 1822-371 with the Chandra High Energy
Transmission Grating Spectrometer (HETGS) for almost nine binary orbits. X-ray
eclipse times provide an update of the orbital ephemeris. We find that our
result follows the quadratic function implied by previous observations;
however, it suggests a flatter trend. Detailed line dynamics also confirm a
previous suggestion that the observed photo-ionized line emission originates
from a confined region in the outer edge of the accretion disk near the hot
spot. Line properties allow us to impose limits on the size of accretion disk,
the central corona, and the emission region. The photo-ionized plasma is
consistent with ionization parameters of log(xi) > 2, and when combined with
disk size and reasonable assumptions for the plasma density, this suggests
illuminating disk luminosities which are over an order of magnitude higher than
what is actually observed. That is, we do not directly observe the central
emitting X-ray source. The spectral continua are best fit by a flat power law
with a high energy cut-off and partial covering absorption (N_H ranging from
5.4-6.3x10^{22} cm^{-2}) with a covering fraction of about 50%. We discuss some
implications of our findings with respect to the photo-ionized line emission

  comments",,"10.1051/0004-6361/200912585",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  [Abridged] With the first 10000 spectra of the flux limited zCOSMOS sample
(I<=22.5) we study the evolution of environmental effects on galaxy properties
since z=1.0, and disentangle the dependence among galaxy colour, stellar mass
and local density (3D local density contrast `delta', computed with the 5th
nearest neighbour approach). We confirm that within a luminosity-limited sample
(M_B<=-20.5-z) the fraction of red (U-B>=1) galaxies 'f_red' depends on delta
at least up to z=1, with red galaxies residing mainly in high densities. This
trend weakens for increasing z, and it is mirrored by the behaviour of the
fraction of galaxies with D4000A break >=1.4. We also find that up to z=1 the
fraction of galaxies with log(EW[OII]) >=1.15 is higher for lower delta, and
also this dependence weakens for increasing z. Given the triple dependence
among galaxy colours, stellar mass and delta, the colour-delta relation found
in the luminosity-selected sample can be due to the broad range of stellar
masses. Thus, we fix the stellar mass and we find that in this case the
colour-delta relation is flat up to z=1 for galaxies with log(M/M_sun)>=10.7.
This means that for these masses the colour-delta relation found in a
luminosity-selected sample is the result of the combined colour-mass and
mass-delta relations. In contrast, we find that for 0.1<=z<=0.5 and
log(M/M_sun)<=10.7 'f_red' depends on delta even at fixed mass. In these mass
and z ranges, environment affects directly also galaxy colours. We suggest a
scenario in which the colour depends primarily on stellar mass, but for
relatively low mass galaxies the local density modulates this dependence. These
galaxies formed more recently, in an epoch when evolved structures were already
in place, and their longer SFH allowed environment-driven physical processes to
operate during longer periods of time.

early Universe is from the direct collapse of primordial gas in atomic-cooling
dark matter haloes in which the gas is unable to cool efficiently via molecular
transitions. We study the formation of such BHs, as well as the accretion of
gas onto these objects and the high energy radiation emitted in the accretion
process, by carrying out cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulations. In
the absence of radiative feedback, we find an upper limit to the accretion rate
onto the central object which forms from the initial collapse of hot (~ 10^4 K)
gas of the order of 0.1 MSun per year. This is high enough for the formation of
a supermassive star, the immediate precursor of a BH, with a mass of the order
of 10^5 MSun. Assuming that a fraction of this mass goes into a BH, we track
the subsequent accretion of gas onto the BH self-consistently with the high
energy radiation emitted from the accretion disk. Using a ray-tracing algorithm
to follow the propagation of ionizing radiation, we model in detail the
evolution of the photoionized region which forms around the accreting BH. We
find that BHs with masses of the order of 10^4 MSun initially accrete at close
to the Eddington limit, but that the accretion rate drops to of order 1 percent
of the Eddington limit after ~ 10^6 yr, due to the expansion of the gas near
the BH in response to strong photoheating and radiation pressure. One signature
of the accretion of gas onto BHs formed by direct collapse, as opposed to
massive Pop III star formation, is an extremely high ratio of the luminosity
emitted in He II 1640 to that emitted in H_alpha (or Ly_alpha); this could be
detected by the James Webb Space Telescope. Finally, we briefly discuss
implications for the coevolution of BHs and their host galaxies.

magnetization oscillations that involve large-amplitude gyrotropic vortex
motion. This dynamics consists of a steady state orbit around the nanocontact,
which is made possible because the intrinsic magnetic damping is compensated by
spin torques. In this article, we present an analytical theory of the power
spectrum of these oscillations based on a rigid-vortex model. The appearance of
vortex oscillations in nanocontacts is not associated with a Hopf bifurcation:
there is no critical current and the only precondition for steady-state
oscillations at finite currents is the existence of a vortex in the system, in
contrast with conventional spin-torque oscillators that involve large-angle
magnetization precession. The oscillation frequency is found to depend linearly
on the applied current and inversely proportional to the orbital radius. By
solving the associated Langevin problem for the vortex dynamics, the lineshape
and linewidth for the power spectrum are also obtained. Under typical
experimental conditions, a Lorentzian lineshape with a current-independent
linewidth is predicted. Good quantitative agreement between the theory and
recent experiments is shown.

use a phonon spectrum that interpolates between a gapped, dispersionless

theoretical probes are used to determine the quantum phase transition,
including energy gap crossing, a finite size scaling analysis, bond order
auto-correlation functions, and bipartite quantum entanglement. All these
probes indicate that in the antiadiabatic phonon limit a quantum phase
transition of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless type is observed at a
non-zero spin-phonon coupling, $g_{\text c}$. An extrapolation from the
Einstein limit to the Debye limit is accompanied by an increase in $g_{\text
c}$ for a fixed optical ($q=\pi $) phonon gap. We therefore conclude that the
dimerized ground state is more unstable with respect to Debye phonons, with the
introduction of phonon dispersion renormalizing the effective spin-lattice
coupling for the Peierls-active mode. We also show that the staggered spin-spin

data can be linked to incipient charge stripes. We employ and extend a
phenomenological model for collective spin and charge fluctuations and analyze
the resulting spin excitation spectrum under the influence of lattice

on the wind and magnetospheric structures of weak-lined T Tauri stars due to a
misalignment between the axis of rotation of the star and its magnetic dipole
moment vector. In such configuration, the system loses the axisymmetry
presented in the aligned case, requiring a fully 3D approach. We perform 3D
numerical MHD simulations of stellar winds and study the effects caused by
different model parameters. The system reaches a periodic behavior with the
same rotational period of the star. We show that the magnetic field lines
present an oscillatory pattern and that by increasing the misalignment angle,
the wind velocity increases. Our wind models allow us to study the interaction
of a magnetized wind with a magnetized extra-solar planet. Such interaction
gives rise to reconnection, generating electrons that propagate along the
planet's magnetic field lines and produce electron cyclotron radiation at radio
wavelengths. We find that a close-in Jupiter-like planet orbiting at 0.05AU
presents a radio power that is ~5 orders of magnitude larger than the one
observed in Jupiter, which suggests that the stellar wind from a young star has
the potential to generate strong planetary radio emission that could be
detected in the near future with LOFAR. This radio power varies according to
the phase of rotation of the star. We also analyze whether winds from
misaligned stellar magnetospheres could cause a significant effect on planetary
migration. Compared to the aligned case, we show that the time-scale tau_w for
an appreciable radial motion of the planet is shorter for larger misalignment
angles. While for the aligned case tau_w~100Myr, for a stellar magnetosphere
tilted by 30deg, tau_w ranges from ~40 to 70Myr for a planet located at a
radius of 0.05AU. (Abridged)

value of w at at least one occurrence of l on the path of execution, with

estimation methods like the ordinary least squares method depend on repetitive
use of numerical integration in order to determine the solution of the system
for each of the parameter values considered, and to find subsequently the
parameter estimate that minimises the objective function. This induces a huge
computational load to such estimation methods. We study the consistency of an
alternative estimator that is defined as a minimiser of an appropriate distance
between a nonparametrically estimated derivative of the solution and the
right-hand side of the system applied to a nonparametrically estimated
solution. This smooth and match estimator (SME) bypasses numerical integration
altogether and reduces the amount of computational time drastically compared to
ordinary least squares. Moreover, we show that under suitable regularity
conditions this smooth and match estimation procedure leads to a
$\sqrt{n}$-consistent estimator of the parameter of interest.

First, it is demonstrated that the problem remains hard even in networks with

Naive Bayes structure). Such proofs extend previous complexity results for the
problem. Inapproximability results are also derived in the case of trees if the
number of states per variable is not bounded. Although the problem is shown to
be hard and inapproximable even in very simple scenarios, a new exact algorithm
is described that is empirically fast in networks of bounded treewidth and
bounded number of states per variable. The same algorithm is used as basis of a
Fully Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme for MAP under such assumptions.
Approximation schemes were generally thought to be impossible for this problem,
but we show otherwise for classes of networks that are important in practice.
The algorithms are extensively tested using some well-known networks as well as

all the way to galaxy clusters and remote protogalactic clouds magnetic fields
of considerable strength and size have been repeatedly observed. Despite their
widespread presence, however, the origin of cosmic magnetic fields is still a
mystery. The galactic dynamo is believed capable of amplifying weak magnetic
seeds to strengths like those measured in ours and other galaxies, but the
question is where do these seed fields come from? Are they a product of late,
post-recombination, physics or are they truly cosmological in origin? The idea
of primordial magnetism is attractive because it makes the large-scale magnetic
fields, especially those found in early protogalactic systems, easier to
explain. As a result, a host of different scenarios have appeared in the
literature. Nevertheless, early magnetogenesis is not problem free, with a
number of issues remaining open and a matter of debate. We review the question
of primordial magnetic fields and consider the limits set on their strength by
the current observational data. The various mechanisms of pre-recombination
magnetogenesis are presented and their advantages and shortcomings are debated.
We consider both classical and quantum scenarios, that operate within as well
as outside the standard model, and also discuss how future observations could
be used to decide whether the large-scale magnetic fields we see in the

phenomenologically be perfectly viable if the LMP before nucleosynthesis decays

the problem of the code's origin and discuss the results of a recent work that
treats the code in terms of an evolving, error-prone information channel. Our
model - which utilizes the rate-distortion theory of noisy communication
channels - suggests that the genetic code originated as a result of the
interplay of the three conflicting evolutionary forces: the needs for diverse
amino-acids, for error-tolerance and for minimal cost of resources. The
description of the code as an information channel allows us to mathematically
identify the fitness of the code and locate its emergence at a second-order
phase transition when the mapping of codons to amino-acids becomes nonrandom.
The noise in the channel brings about an error-graph, in which edges connect
codons that are likely to be confused. The emergence of the code is governed by
the topology of the error-graph, which determines the lowest modes of the
graph-Laplacian and is related to the map coloring problem.

points are localized at the M points of the Brillouin zone and are hybrid: the

dispersion along the perpendicular direction MK. For larger values of N3 the
new points have a linear dispersion, and are situated along the MK line. For a
value of N3 equal to 1/2 NN, these points merge with the Dirac cones at the K

effects of changing the N2 coupling are not so dramatic. We calculate the

closing of contacts during propagation. The speed of the leading edge of the
pulse is in quantitative agreement with predictions for one-dimensional chains,

demixing, we study the universal critical properties of a system, which belongs
to the Ising universality class, in the film geometry. We employ periodic
boundary conditions in the two lateral directions and fixed boundary conditions
on the two confining surfaces, such that one of them has a spatially
homogeneous adsorption preference while the other one exhibits a laterally
alternating adsorption preference, resembling locally a single chemical step.
By means of Monte Carlo simulations of an improved Hamiltonian, so that the
leading scaling corrections are suppressed, numerical integration, and
finite-size scaling analysis we determine the critical Casimir force and its
universal scaling function for various values of the aspect ratio of the film.
In the limit of a vanishing aspect ratio the critical Casimir force of this
system reduces to the mean value of the critical Casimir force for laterally
homogeneous ++ and +- boundary conditions, corresponding to the surface spins
on the two surfaces being fixed to equal and opposite values, respectively. We
show that the universal scaling function of the critical Casimir force for
small but finite aspect ratios displays a linear dependence on the aspect ratio
which is solely due to the presence of the lateral inhomogeneity. We also
analyze the order-parameter profiles at criticality and their universal scaling
function which allows us to probe theoretical predictions and to compare with
experimental data.

lambda(T) was measured down to 200mK in zero field. We find lambda(T) follows a

with strong scattering. Magnetic fields of up to B =55T or 14T were used for
the ? tau(B) and C(T)/R(T) measurements respectively. The specific heat,
resistivity and torque measurements were used to map out the (H,T) phase

same single crystal sample so that the different information revealed by these
probes is clearly distinguished. Heat capacity data strongly resemble those
found for the high Tc cuprates, where strong fluctuation effects wipe-out the
phase transition at Hc2. Unusually, here we find the fluctuation effects appear
to be strongly anisotropic.

formalism provides an intuitive picture of the resonances in the coupled
channel approach, as bound states of one bound channel, which decays into open
ones. It also provides an insight and practical rules for evaluating couplings
of the resonances to external sources and how to deal with final state
interaction in production processes. As an application of the formalism we
