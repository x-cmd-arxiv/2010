quantizing them into scaled integer intensity levels, which removes some of the
uncompressible noise in the image. The integers are then losslessly compressed
using the fast and efficient Rice algorithm and stored in a portable FITS
format file. Quantizing an image more coarsely gives greater image compression,
but it also increases the noise and degrades the precision of the photometric
and astrometric measurements in the quantized image. Dithering the pixel values
during the quantization process can greatly improve the precision of
measurements in the images. This is especially important if the analysis
algorithm relies on the mode or the median which would be similarly quantized
if the pixel values are not dithered. We perform a series of experiments on
both synthetic and real astronomical CCD images to quantitatively demonstrate
that the magnitudes and positions of stars in the quantized images can be
measured with the predicted amount of precision. In order to encourage wider
use of these image compression methods, we have made available a pair of
general-purpose image compression programs, called fpack and funpack, which can

The Higgs boson is centrally produced by gluon fusion with two Large Rapidity
Gaps emerging in the final state, being the main experimental signature for
this process. As already studied for Pomeron-Pomeron and two-photon processes,
the Higgs boson photoproduction is studied within this new mechanism in
proton-proton ($pp$) and proton-nucleus ($pA$) collisions, where each system
has a different dynamics to be taken into account. As a result, this mechanism
predicts a production cross section for $pp$ collisions of about 1.8 fb, which
is similar to that obtained in Pomeron-Pomeron processes. Besides, in $pPb$
collisions the cross sections have increased to about 0.6 pb, being comparable
with the results of two-photon processes in $pAu$ collisions. Therefore, as the
Rapidity Gap Survival Probability is an open question in high-energy Physics,
an analysis for different values of this probability shows how competitive are
the mechanisms in the LHC kinematical regime.

unconditionally heteroscedastic and serially dependent are considered. The
volatility structure is deterministic and quite general, including breaks or
trending variances as special cases. In this framework we propose Ordinary
Least Squares (OLS), Generalized Least Squares (GLS) and Adaptive Least Squares
(ALS) procedures. The GLS estimator requires the knowledge of the time-varying
variance structure while in the ALS approach the unknown variance is estimated
by kernel smoothing with the outer product of the OLS residuals vectors.
Different bandwidths for the different cells of the time-varying variance
matrix are also allowed. We derive the asymptotic distribution of the proposed
estimators for the VAR model coefficients and compare their properties. In
particular we show that the ALS estimator is asymptotically equivalent to the
infeasible GLS estimator. This asymptotic equivalence is obtained uniformly
with respect to the bandwidth(s) in a given range and hence justifies
data-driven bandwidth rules. Using these results we build Wald tests for the
linear Granger causality in mean which are adapted to VAR processes driven by
errors with a non stationary volatility. It is also shown that the commonly
used standard Wald test for the linear Granger causality in mean is potentially
unreliable in our framework. Monte Carlo experiments illustrate the use of the
different estimation approaches for the analysis of VAR models with stable
innovations.

between the 1st and up to the 4th subbands are identified by well-separated
anti-level-crossing split resonance, while the hy-lying subbands were
identified by the cyclotron resonance linewidth broadening in the literature.
In addition, a forbidden intersubband transition (1st to 3rd) has been
observed. With the precise determination of the subband structure, we find that
the depolarization shift can be well described by the semiclassical slab plasma

Our remarks are based on a series of examples concerning the role of source
terms in relatively simple supergravity backgrounds that allow for a
well-controlled approach to the problem. The observations suggest that, in
opposite to general practice, one could consider such terms for both kinds of
branes, while their presence is only essential for smeared sources - as is
commonly the case for flavor-branes. Among the examples studied are D3-D7

argue that this simple observation has implications for the force and energy

traditionally associated with enhanced local mechanical heating which increases
temperatures and pressures. Simple physical considerations then suggest that
the network chromosphere may not be able to reach horizontal force balance with

three families of relatively simple, low-nuclearity transition metal clusters:
spin S = 4 Ni4, Mn(III)3 (S = 2 and 6) and Mn(III)6 (S = 4 and 12). The Mn(III)
complexes are related by the fact that they contain triangular Mn3 units in
which the exchange may be switched from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic
without significantly altering the coordination around the Mn(III) centers,
thereby leaving the single-ion physics more-or-less unaltered. This allows for
a detailed and systematic study of the way in which the individual-ion
anisotropies project onto the molecular spin ground state in otherwise
identical low- and high-spin molecules, thus providing unique insights into the
key factors that control the quantum dynamics of SMMs, namely: (i) the height
of the kinetic barrier to magnetization relaxation; and (ii) the transverse
interactions that cause tunneling through this barrier. Numerical calculations
are supported by an unprecedented experimental data set (17 different
compounds), including very detailed spectroscopic information obtained from
high-frequency electron paramagnetic resonance and low-temperature hysteresis
measurements. Diagonalization of the multi-spin Hamiltonian matrix is necessary
in order to fully capture the interplay between exchange and local anisotropy,
and the resultant spin-state mixing which ultimately gives rise to the
tunneling matrix elements in the high symmetry SMMs (ferromagnetic Mn3 and
Ni4). The simplicity (low-nuclearity, high-symmetry, weak disorder, etc..) of
the molecules highlighted in this study proves to be of crucial importance.

applications in error correction coding. Hence, reducing the computational
complexities of DFTs is of great significance, especially for long DFTs as
increasingly longer error control codes are chosen for digital communication
and storage systems. Since DFTs involve both multiplications and additions over
finite fields and multiplications are much more complex than additions,
recently proposed cyclotomic fast Fourier transforms (CFFTs) are promising due
to their low multiplicative complexity. Unfortunately, they have very high
additive complexity. Techniques such as common subexpression elimination (CSE)
can be used to reduce the additive complexity of CFFTs, but their effectiveness
for long DFTs is limited by their complexity. In this paper, we propose prime
factor cyclotomic Fourier transforms (PFCFTs), which use CFFTs as sub-DFTs via
the prime factor algorithm. When the length of DFTs is prime, our PFCFTs reduce
to CFFTs. When the length has co-prime factors, since the sub-DFTs have much
shorter lengths, this allows us to use CSE to significantly reduce their
additive complexity. In comparison to previously proposed fast Fourier
transforms, our PFCFTs achieve reduced overall complexity when the length of
DFTs is at least 255, and the improvement significantly increases as the length
grows. This approach also enables us to propose efficient DFTs with very long
length (e.g., 4095-point), first efficient DFTs of such lengths in the
literature. Finally, our PFCFTs are also advantageous for hardware
implementation due to their regular structure.

prescribed row sums r=(r_1,...,r_m) and column sums c=(c_1,...,c_n). The
configuration model for uniformly sampling binary contingency tables proceeds
as follows. First, label N=\sum_{i=1}^{m} r_i tokens of type 1, arrange them in
m cells, and let the i-th cell contain r_i tokens. Next, label another set of
tokens of type 2 containing N=\sum_{j=1}^{n}c_j elements arranged in n cells,
and let the j-th cell contain c_j tokens. Finally, pair the type-1 tokens with
the type-2 tokens by generating a random permutation until the total pairing
corresponds to a binary contingency table. Generating one random permutation
takes O(N) time, which is optimal up to constant factors. A fundamental
question is whether a constant number of permutations is sufficient to obtain a
binary contingency table. In the current paper, we solve this problem by
showing a necessary and sufficient condition so that the probability that the
configuration model outputs a binary contingency table remains bounded away
from 0 as N goes to \infty. Our finding shows surprising differences from
recent results for binary symmetric contingency tables.

Rapha\""el-Szeftel (2009), where an open subset in $H^3_{rad}(\mathbb{R}^3)$ is
obtained. The method of proof can be summarized as follows: on the whole space,
high frequencies above the blow-up scale are controlled by the bilinear
Strichartz estimates. On the other hand, outside the blow-up core, low
frequencies are controlled by finite speed of propagation.

was studied by mean field theory, and it was found that, usually the tug-of-war
model has one, two, or three distinct stable stationary points. However, the
results there are mostly obtained by numerical calculations, since it is hard
to do detailed theoretical studies to a two-dimensional nonlinear system. In
this paper, we will carry out further detailed analysis about this model, and
try to find more properties theoretically. Firstly, the tug-of-war model is
simplified to a one-dimensional equation. Then we claim that the stationary
points of the tug-of-war model correspond to the roots of the simplified
equation, and the stable stationary points correspond to the roots with
positive derivative. Bifurcation occurs at the corresponding parameters, under
which the simplified one-dimensional equation exists root with zero derivative.
Using the simplified equation, not only more properties of the tug-of-war model
can be obtained analytically, the related numerical calculations will become
more accurate and more efficient. This simplification will be helpful to future
studies of the tug-of-war model.

rate. Sufficient quantities of molecular gas are available in most BCGs to
power their AGN by accretion alone. However, we find no correlation between AGN
power and molecular gas mass over the range of jet power considered here. For a
given AGN power, the BCG's gas mass and accretion efficiency, defined as the
fraction of the available cold molecular gas that is required to power the AGN,
both vary by more than two orders of magnitude. Most of the molecular gas in
BCGs is apparently consumed by star formation or is driven out of the nucleus
by the AGN before it reaches the nuclear black hole. Bondi accretion from hot
atmospheres is generally unable to fuel powerful AGN, unless their black holes
are more massive than their bulge luminosities imply. We identify several
powerful AGN that reside in relatively gas-poor galaxies, indicating an
unusually efficient mode of accretion, or that their AGN are powered by another
mechanism. If these systems are powered primarily by black hole spin, rather
than by accretion, spin must also be tapped efficiently in some systems, i.e.,
$P_{\rm jet} > \dot Mc^2$, or their black hole masses must be substantially
larger than the values implied by their bulge luminosities. We constrain the
(model dependent) accretion rate at the transition from radiatively inefficient

The problem is solved by developing a suitable numerical method. The results

in existing scientific literatures. The study reveals that a back flow occurs
near the central line of the channel due to the stretching walls and further
that this flow reversal can be stopped by applying a strong external magnetic

by using a truncated Edgeworth series. We give some general guidelines on the
use of such a series, noting in particular that 1) the Edgeworth series cannot
represent models with nonzero f_NL, unless g_NL is nonzero also, 2) the series
cannot represent models with g_NL<0, unless some higher-order non-Gaussianities
are known. Finally, we apply the Edgeworth series to calculate the effects of
g_NL on the abundances of massive clusters and large voids. We show that the
abundance of voids may generally be more sensitive to high-order
non-Gaussianities than the cluster abundance.

the Band 4b receiver. The observed spectral line profile is nearly parabolic,
but with a slight asymmetry associated with blueshifted absorption, and the
integrated antenna temperature is 1.69 \pm 0.17 K km/s. This detection of
thermal water vapour emission, carried out as part of a small survey of water
in carbon-rich stars, is only the second such detection toward a carbon-rich
AGB star, the first having been obtained by the Submillimeter Wave Astronomy
Satellite toward IRC+10216. For an assumed ortho-to-para ratio of 3 for water,
the observed line intensity implies a water outflow rate ~ (3 - 6) E-5 Earth
masses per year and a water abundance relative to H2 of ~ (2-5) E-6. This value
is a factor of at least 1E+4 larger than the expected photospheric abundance in
a carbon-rich environment, and - as in IRC+10216 - raises the intriguing
possibility that the observed water is produced by the vapourisation of
orbiting comets or dwarf planets. However, observations of the single line
observed to date do not permit us to place strong constraints upon the spatial
distribution or origin of the observed water, but future observations of
additional transitions will allow us to determine the inner radius of the
H2O-emitting zone, and the H2O ortho-to-para ratio, and thereby to place
important constraints upon the origin of the observed water emission.

the Swedish 1-meter Solar Telescope, restoration with Multi-Frame Blind
Deconvolution and Joint Phase Diverse Speckle methods lead to remarkable
improvements in image quality but granulation contrasts that are too low,
indicating additional stray light. Aims. We propose a method to compensate for
stray light from high-order atmospheric aberrations not included in MFBD and
JPDS processing. Methods. To compensate for uncorrected aberrations, a
reformulation of the image restoration process is proposed that allows the
average effect of hundreds of high-order modes to be compensated for by relying
on Kolmogorov statistics for these modes. The applicability of the method
requires simultaneous measurements of Fried's parameter r0. The method is
tested with simulations as well as real data and extended to include
compensation for conventional stray light. Results. We find that only part of
the reduction of granulation contrast in SST images is due to uncompensated
high-order aberrations. The remainder is still unaccounted for and attributed
to stray light from the atmosphere, the telescope with its re-imaging system
and to various high-altitude seeing effects. Conclusions. We conclude that
statistical compensation of high-order modes is a viable method to reduce the
loss of contrast occurring when a limited number of aberrations is explicitly
compensated for with MFBD and JPDS processing. We show that good such
compensation is possible with only 10 recorded frames. The main limitation of
the method is that already MFBD and JPDS processing introduces high-order
compensation that, if not taken into account, can lead to over-compensation.

spectrum radio quasar at z=0.361) during its high activity period between 2008
September and 2009 June. During this 11 months period, the source was
characterized by a complex variability at optical, UV and gamma-ray bands, on
time scales down to 6-12 hours. The brightest gamma-ray isotropic luminosity,
recorded on 2009 March 26, was ~ 2x10^48erg s^-1. The spectrum in the Fermi-LAT
energy range shows a mild curvature well described by a log-parabolic law, and
can be understood as due to the Klein-Nishina effect. The gamma-ray flux has a
complex correlation with the other wavelengths. There is no correlation at all
with the X-ray band, a weak correlation with the UV, and a significant
correlation with the optical flux. The gamma-ray flux seems to lead the optical
one by about 13 days. From the UV photometry we estimated a black hole mass of
~ 5.4x10^8 solar masses, and an accretion rate of ~ 0.5 solar masses/year.
Although the power in the thermal and non-thermal outputs is smaller compared
to the very luminous and distant flat spectrum radio quasars, PKS 1510-089
exhibits a quite large Compton dominance and a prominent big blue bump (BBB) as
observed in the most powerful gamma-ray quasars. The BBB was still prominent
during the historical maximum optical state in 2009 May, but the optical/UV
spectral index was softer than in the quiescent state. This seems to indicate
that the BBB was not completely dominated by the synchrotron emission during
the highest optical state. We model the broadband spectrum assuming a leptonic
scenario in which the inverse Compton emission is dominated by the scattering

the gravitino mass for goldstini masses can arise when their scalar partners
are stabilized far from the origin. Considerations arising from the complexity
of realistic string compactifications indicate that many of the independent

If the sequestered hidden sector is a metastable SUSY-breaking sector of the
Intriligator-Seiberg-Shih (ISS) type then multiple goldstini can originate from
within a single sector, along with many supplementary 'modulini', all with
masses of order twice the gravitino mass. These fields can couple to the
Supersymmetric Standard Model (SSM) via the 'Goldstino Portal'. Collider
signatures involving SSM sparticle decays can provide strong evidence for
warped-or-conformally-sequestered sectors, and of the ISS mechanism of SUSY

region in different emission lines yielding spatially resolved information
about the physical properties of the gas. The configuration was chosen to cover
the whole spectrum from 3600 up to 10000 A. We selected four luminous knots, to
perform a detailed integrated spectroscopic analysis of these structures and of
the whole PPak field-of-view (FOV). For all the knots the electron density has
been found to be very similar and below 100 cm^-3. The [OIII] electron
temperature was measured in knots A, B, C and in the integrated PPak-field, and
was found to be around 8000 K. The temperatures of [OII] and [SIII] were
estimated in the four cases. The elemental abundances computed from the ""direct
method"" are typical of high metallicity disk HII regions, with a mean value of
12+log(O/H)= 8.65, comparable to what has been found in this galaxy by other
authors for regions at similar galactocentric distance. Therefore, a remarkable
abundance uniformity is found despite the different excitations found
throughout the nebula. Wolf-Rayet features have been detected in three of the
knots, leading to a derived total number of WR stars of 125, 22 and 5, for
knots A, C and B, respectively. The integrated spectrum of the whole PPak FOV
shows high excitation and a relatively evolved age which does not correspond to
the individual knot evolutionary stages. Some effects associated to the loss of
spatial resolution could also be evidenced by the higher ionising temperature
that is deduced from the eta' parameter measured in the integrated PPak

abundance of dark clouds (x(H2O) < 7x10^-9). We investigate the chemistry of
water vapor in starless cores beyond the previous upper limits using the highly
improved angular resolution and sensitivity of Herschel and measure the
abundance of water vapor during evolutionary stages just preceding star
formation. High spectral resolution observations of the fundamental ortho water
(o-H2O) transition (557 GHz) were carried out with Herschel HIFI toward two
starless cores: B68, a Bok globule, and L1544, a prestellar core embedded in
the Taurus molecular cloud complex. The rms in the brightness temperature
measured for the B68 and L1544 spectra is 2.0 and 2.2 mK, respectively, in a
velocity bin of 0.59 km s^-1. The continuum level is 3.5+/-0.2 mK in B68 and
11.4+/-0.4 mK in L1544. No significant feature is detected in B68 and the 3
sigma upper limit is consistent with a column density of o-H2O N(o-H2O) <
2.5x10^13 cm^-2, or a fractional abundance x(o-H2O) < 1.3x10^-9, more than an
order of magnitude lower than the SWAS upper limit on this source. The L1544
spectrum shows an absorption feature at a 5 sigma level from which we obtain
the first value of the o-H2O column density ever measured in dark clouds:
N(o-H2O) = (8+/-4)x10^12 cm^-2. The corresponding fractional abundance is
x(o-H2O) ~ 5x10^-9 at radii > 7000 AU and ~2x10^-10 toward the center. The
radiative transfer analysis shows that this is consistent with a x(o-H2O)
profile peaking at ~10^-8, 0.1 pc away from the core center, where both
freeze-out and photodissociation are negligible. Herschel has provided the
first measurement of water vapor in dark regions. Prestellar cores such as
L1544 (with their high central densities, strong continuum, and large
envelopes) are very promising tools to finally shed light on the solid/vapor
balance of water in molecular clouds.

We find that the precession of these non-axisymmetric structures produce
negligible flux variations but a change in the height of these structures can
lead to significant changes in the mid-infrared flux. Applying these models to
observations of the young stellar object LRLL 31 suggests that the observed
variability could be explained by a warped inner disk with variable scale

layer), where the light fission fragments of the beam fuse with the light
fission fragments of the target. Via the 'hole-boring' mode of laser Radiation
Pressure Acceleration using a high-intensity, short pulse laser, very
efficiently bunches of 232Th with solid-state density can be generated from a
Th layer, placed beneath a deuterated polyethylene foil, both forming the
production target. Th ions laser-accelerated to about 7 MeV/u will pass through
a thin CH2 layer placed in front of a thicker second Th foil closely behind the
production target and disintegrate into light and heavy fission fragments. In
addition, light ions (d,C) from the CD2 production target will be accelerated
as well to about 7 MeV/u, inducing the fission process of 232Th also in the
second Th layer. The laser-accelerated ion bunches with solid-state density,
which are about 10^14 times more dense than classically accelerated ion
bunches, allow for a high probability that generated fission products can fuse
again. In contrast to classical radioactive beam facilities, where intense but
low-density radioactive beams are merged with stable targets, the novel
fission-fusion process draws on the fusion between neutron-rich, short-lived,
light fission fragments both from beam and target. The high ion beam density
may lead to a strong collective modification of the stopping power in the
target, leading to significant range enhancement. Using a high-intensity laser
as envisaged for the ELI-Nuclear Physics project in Bucharest (ELI-NP),
estimates promise a fusion yield of about 10^3 ions per laser pulse in the mass
range of A=180-190, thus enabling to approach the r-process waiting point at

previously published near-infrared spectroscopy and mid-infrared photometry, to
produce the spectral energy distribution for the very low-temperature T dwarf.
We use atmospheric models to derive the bolometric correction and obtain a
luminosity of log L/Lsun = -6.01 +/- 0.05. Evolutionary models are used with
the luminosity to constrain the values of effective temperature (T_eff) and
surface gravity, and hence mass and age for the T dwarf. We further restrict
the allowed range of T_eff and gravity using age constraints implied by the M
dwarf primary, and refine the physical properties of the T dwarf by comparison
of the observed and modelled spectroscopy and photometry. This comparison
indicates that Wolf 940 B has a metallicity within 0.2 dex of solar, as more
extreme values give poor fits to the data - lower metallicity produces a poor
fit at lambda > 2um while higher metallicity produces a poor fit at lambda <
2um. This is consistent with the independently derived value of [m/H] = +0.24
+/- 0.09 for the primary star, using the Johnson & Apps (2008) M_K:V-K

applications. For example, we can:
  1. Improve the linear k-sparse recovery of heavy hitters in Zipfian
distributions with O(k log n) space from a (1+eps) approximation to a (1 +
o(1)) approximation, giving the first such approximation in O(k log n) space
when k <= O(n^{1-eps}).
  2. Recover block-sparse vectors with O(k) space and a (1+eps) approximation.
Previous algorithms required either omega(k) space or omega(1) approximation.

most poorly constrained ingredients of mean-field dynamo models. This lack of
constraint has previously led to controversy regarding the most appropriate set
of parameters, as different assumptions on the value of turbulent diffusivity
lead to radically different solar cycle predictions. Typically, the dynamo
community uses double step diffusivity profiles characterized by low values of
diffusivity in the bulk of the convection zone. However, these low diffusivity
values are not consistent with theoretical estimates based on mixing-length
theory -- which suggest much higher values for turbulent diffusivity. To make
matters worse, kinematic dynamo simulations cannot yield sustainable magnetic
cycles using these theoretical estimates. In this work we show that magnetic
cycles become viable if we combine the theoretically estimated diffusivity
profile with magnetic quenching of the diffusivity. Furthermore, we find that
the main features of this solution can be reproduced by a dynamo simulation
using a prescribed (kinematic) diffusivity profile that is based on the
spatiotemporal geometric-average of the dynamically quenched diffusivity. Here,
we provide an analytic fit to the dynamically quenched diffusivity profile,
which can be used in kinematic dynamo simulations. Having successfully
reconciled the mixing-length theory estimated diffusivity profile with
kinematic dynamo models, we argue that they remain a viable tool for
understanding the solar magnetic cycle.

background sourced by the brane would not resolve the ghost issue, unless a
very specific condition is satisfied (if satisfiable at all). As for other
properties of the model, from an explicit analysis of the 4-dimensional
graviton propagator we extract a mass, a decay width and a momentum dependent
modification of the gravitational coupling for the spin 2 mode. In the flat
space approximation, the mass of the problematic spin 0 ghost is instrumental
in filtering out a brane cosmological constant. The mass replaces a background
curvature that would have had the same function. The optical theorem is used to
demonstrate the suppression of graviton leakage into the uncompactified bulk.
Then, we derive the 4-dimensional effective action for gravity and show that
general covariance is spontaneously broken by the bulk-brane setup. This
provides a natural realization of the gravitational Higgs mechanism. We also
show that the addition of extrinsic curvature dependent terms has no bearing on

demonstrate that thing can be done in the simulator in which context
information can be created by virtual sensors instead of physical sensors. In
this paper, we propose ISS, an Interactive Smart home Simulator system aiming
at controlling and simulating the behavior of an intelligent house. The
developed system aims to provide architects, designers a simulation and useful
tool for understanding the interaction between environment, people and the
impact of embedded and pervasive technology on in daily life. In this research,
the smart house is considered as an environment made up of independent and
distributed devices interacting to support user's goals and tasks. Therefore,
by using ISS, the developer can realize the relationship among virtual home
space, surrounded environment, use and home appliances.

analysis shows that the individual power distribution is in a Gaussian shape
and their peak frequencies ($\nu_{max}$) are in a good agreement with the
prediction by the scaling law. With using a pre-whitening procedure,
significant frequency peaks more than 3 $\sigma$ are extracted for these
giants. From these peaks, we determined the large frequency separation by
constructing highest peak distribution of collapsed power spectrum, which is
also in good agreement with what the scaling law for the large separation
predicts. Echelle diagrams of oscillation frequency were created based on the
extracted large separations, which is very useful to clarify the properties of
oscillation modes. In these echelle diagrams, odd-even mode sequences are
clearly seen. Therefore, it is certain that in these G-type giants, non-radial
modes are detected in addition to radial mode. As a consequence, these
properties of oscillation modes are shown to follow what Dzymbowski et
al.(2001) and Dupret et al.(2009) theoretically predicted. Damping times for

have sufficiently large amplitudes to disturb the spot. For a $l'=m$ core

that the background branes located at orbifold fixed points should be NS-branes

the background NS-branes is indispensable to obtain flat geometry $M_4 \times
S_1 / \mathbb{Z}_2$ where $M_4$ represents the 4d Minkowski spacetime, and
without these branes the 5d metric becomes singular everywhere. This result is
very reminiscent of the $(p+3)$d effective string theory \cite{1} where the
NS-NS type $p$-brane is indispensable to obtain a flat geometry $R_2$ or $R_2

the 2d transverse space becomes a pin-shaped singular space. The correspondence
between these two theories leads us to a conjecture that the whole flat

A key ingredient in our proofs is a class of orientations characterizing
$d$-angulations of girth $d$. Earlier results by Schnyder and by De Fraysseix

=< d =< n-1, which correspond to partly degenerate representations of the W(n)

D-branes, and relate these two approaches by using the semi-classical light
asymptotic limit. In particular we determine the bulk one-point functions. We
observe remarkably severe divergences in the annulus partition functions, and
attribute their origin to the existence of infinite multiplicities in the
fusion of representations of the W(n>2) algebra. We also comment on the issue
of the existence of a boundary action, using the calculus of constrained
functional forms, and derive the generating function of the B""acklund
transformation for sl(3) Toda classical mechanics, using the minisuperspace
limit of the bulk one-point function.

elements transfer. This problem is at the core of quantum measurements and
state transfer. Given two systems $\A$ and $\B$ with initial density matrices
$\lambda$ and $r$, respectively, we consider interactions that lead to
transferring certain matrix elements of unknown $\lambda$ into those of the
final state ${\widetilde r}$ of $\B$. We find that this process eliminates the
memory on the transferred (or certain other) matrix elements from the final
state of $\A$. If one diagonal matrix element is transferred, ${\widetilde
r}_{aa}=\lambda_{aa}$, the memory on each non-diagonal element
$\lambda_{a\not=b}$ is completely eliminated from the final density operator of
$\A$. Consider the following three quantities $\Re \la_{a\not =b}$, $\Im
\la_{a\not =b}$ and $\la_{aa}-\la_{bb}$ (the real and imaginary part of a
non-diagonal element and the corresponding difference between diagonal
elements). Transferring one of them, e.g., $\Re\tir_{a\not = b}=\Re\la_{a\not =
b}$, erases the memory on two others from the final state of $\A$.
Generalization of these set-ups to a finite-accuracy transfer brings in a
trade-off between the accuracy and the amount of preserved memory. This
trade-off is expressed via system-independent uncertainty relations which
account for local aspects of the accuracy-disturbance trade-off in quantum
measurements.

system differences along with differences in lifespan may play a key role. We
examine whether these factors are likely to lead to male-biased parasitism
through natural selection taking into account the critical role that ecological
feedbacks play in the evolution of defence. We use a host-parasite model with
two-sexes and the techniques of adaptive dynamics to investigate how mating
system and sexual differences in competitive ability and longevity can select
for a bias in the rates of parasitism. Male-biased parasitism is selected for
when males have a shorter average lifespan or when males are subject to greater
competition for resources. Male-biased parasitism evolves as a consequence of
sexual differences in life history that produce a greater proportion of
susceptible females than males and therefore reduce the cost of avoiding
parasitism in males. Different mating systems such as monogamy, polygamy or
polyandry did not produce a bias in parasitism through these ecological
feedbacks but may accentuate an existing bias.

physics. It associates to every bosonic degree of freedom a fermionic one and
vice versa. Supersymmetry unifies the coupling constants of the
electromagnetic, weak and strong forces at a high scale and provides a
candidate for the elusive dark matter. Supersymmetry could be discovered at the
LHC, the proton--proton collider at CERN which has started operations in 2008.
The LHC is foreseen to have a center--of--mass energy of 14~TeV, opening up a
new mass range to be explored to search for supersymmetric particles with the
ATLAS and CMS experiments. The development and production of electronics for
these detectors has been a challenge, e.g. for the readout board for the
electromagnetic calorimeter. Reconstructing the physics events with the best
precision, in particular the reconstruction and identification of electrons and
photons in the large QCD background has been prepared in extensive test beam
studies and Monte Carlo simulations. If the Higgs boson and supersymmetry are
discovered, the properties of the (s)particles such as the masses, branching
ratios must be measured precisely, either at the LHC or at a future e+e- linear
collider. The SFitter project aims to determine the underlying theoretical
model parameters from the correlated experimental measurements including
theoretical errors. The methods are applied to the extraction of the
fundamental parameters of supersymmetry as well the measurement of the Higgs
boson couplings at the LHC. The extrapolation of the supersymmetric parameters

follow power-law behaviors: $P(k_{0}) \propto k_{0}^{1-\alpha}$, and
$P(k)\propto k^{1-\gamma}$, respectively. For the total number of links as a

where $\beta$ is (at the beginning of the network evolution) between 1.25 and
2, while converging to $\sim 1$ for large $N$. This indicates a transition from
a growth regime with increasing network density towards a sustainable regime,
which revents a collapse because of ever increasing dependencies. Our
theoretical framework is able to predict relations between the exponents
$\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$, which also link issues of software engineering and
developer activity. These relations are verified by means of computer

explain such a complex morphology: galaxy merger, accretion disk instability,
precession of the jet and jet-cloud interactions. It is possible that we are
witnessing an ongoing jet precession in this source due to internal
instabilities within the jet flow, however, a dense environment detected in the
submillimeter band and an outflowing material suggested by the X-ray absorption
could strongly interact with the jet. It is difficult to establish the
orientation between the jet axis and the observer in 1045+352 because of the
complex structure. Nevertheless taking into account the most recent inner radio
structure we conclude that the radio jet is oriented close to the line of sight

finite and infinite words. Deterministic finite automata are the simplest
devices to recognise regular languages, and deterministic Buchi, Co-Buchi, and
parity automata play a similar role in the recognition of \omega-regular
languages. While it is well known that the minimisation of deterministic finite
and weak automata is cheap, the complexity of minimising deterministic Buchi
and parity automata has remained an open challenge. We establish the
NP-completeness of these problems. A second contribution of this report is the
introduction of relaxed minimisation of deterministic finite automata. Like
hyper-minimisation, relaxed minimisation allows for some changes in the
language of the automaton: We seek a smallest automaton that, when used as a
monitor, provides a wrong answer only a bounded number of times in any run of a
system. We argue that minimisation of finite automata, hyper-minimisation,
relaxed minimisation, and the minimisation of deterministic Buchi (or Co-Buchi)
automata are operations of increasing reduction power, as the respective
equivalence relations on automata become coarser from left to right. When we
allow for minor changes in the language, relaxed minimisation can therefore be
considered as a more powerful minimisation technique than hyper-minimisation
from the perspective of finite automata. From the perspective of Buchi and
Co-Buchi automata, we gain a cheap algorithm for state-space reduction that
also turns out to be beneficial for further heuristic or exhaustive state-space
reductions put on top of it.

an N-dimensional hyperbolic space with nonconstant curvature. The spectrum of

most likely sources of gravitational radiation, yet to be detected on or near

symmetry rules. On the other hand, the general theory of gravitational waves
emitted by axially symmetric rotating sources predicts the existence of a
non-vanishing news function. The existence of such function implies that, for a
distant observer, the asymptotic group of isometries, the BMS group, has a
translational symmetry that depends on the orbit periodicity of the source,
thus breaking the isotropy o the Poincar\'e translations. These results suggest
the application of the asymptotic BMS-covariant wave equation to obtain a
proper theoretical basis for the gravitational waves observations.

attracted much attention in the research community in the past few years. The
aim of LP decoding is to develop an algorithm which has error-correcting
performance similar to that of the Sum-Product (SP) decoding algorithm, while
at the same time it should be amenable to mathematical analysis. The LP
decoding algorithm has also been extended to nonbinary linear codes by Flanagan
et al. However, the most important problem with LP decoding for both binary and
nonbinary linear codes is that the complexity of standard LP solvers such as
the simplex algorithm remain prohibitively large for codes of moderate to large
block length. To address this problem, Vontobel et al. proposed a low
complexity LP decoding algorithm for binary linear codes which has complexity
linear in the block length. In this paper, we extend the latter work and
propose a low-complexity LP decoding algorithm for nonbinary linear codes. We
use the LP formulation proposed by Flanagan et al. as a basis and derive a pair
of primal-dual LP formulations. The dual LP is then used to develop the
low-complexity LP decoding algorithm for nonbinary linear codes. In contrast to
the binary low-complexity LP decoding algorithm, our proposed algorithm is not
directly related to the nonbinary SP algorithm. Nevertheless, the complexity of
the proposed algorithm is linear in the block length and is limited mainly by
the maximum check node degree. As a proof of concept, we also present a
simulation result for a $[80,48]$ LDPC code defined over $\mathbb{Z}_4$ using
quaternary phase-shift keying over the AWGN channel, and we show that the
error-correcting performance of the proposed LP decoding algorithm is similar
to that of the standard LP decoding using the simplex solver.

characterized via statistical descriptors, such as the $n$-point correlation
function $S_n$. An intricate inverse problem of practical importance is to what
extent a medium can be reconstructed from the two-point correlation function
$S_2$ of a target medium. Recently, general claims of the uniqueness of
reconstructions using $S_2$ have been made based on numerical studies. Here, we
provide a systematic approach to characterize the geometrical ambiguity of
$S_2$ for both continuous two-phase heterogeneous media and their digitized
representations in a mathematically precise way. In particular, we derive the
exact conditions for the case where two distinct media possess identical $S_2$.
The degeneracy conditions are given in terms of integral and algebraic
equations for continuous media and their digitized representations,
respectively. By examining these equations and constructing their rigorous
solutions for specific examples, we conclusively show that in general $S_2$ is
indeed not sufficient information to uniquely determine the structure of the
medium, which is consistent with the results of our recent study on
heterogeneous media reconstruction [Jiao, Stillinger and Torquato, PNAS 106,

d=2m/n is well-known to be \alpha(G(n,m))~2n ln(d)/d with high probability.
Moreover, a trivial greedy algorithm w.h.p. finds an independent set of size
(1+o(1)) n ln(d)/d, i.e. half the maximum size. Yet in spite of 30 years of
extensive research no efficient algorithm has emerged to produce an independent
set with (1+c)n ln(d)/d, for any fixed c>0. In this paper we prove that the
combinatorial structure of the independent set problem in random graphs
undergoes a phase transition as the size k of the independent sets passes the
point k nln(d)/d. Roughly speaking, we prove that independent sets of size
k>(1+c)n ln(d)/d form an intricately ragged landscape, in which local search
algorithms are bound to get stuck. We illustrate this phenomenon by providing
an exponential lower bound for the Metropolis process, a Markov chain for
sampling independents sets.

cultivable bacteria in a river, which will be used to study the distribution of
antibiotic resistant bacteria in the environment. We consider both antibiotic
resistant and non-antibiotic resistant bacteria in the model, and, taking into
account the strong correlation between land use and antibiotic resistant
bacteria in rivers, we include a function for the influx of bacteria into the
river from the shore. We simulate the model for two different time scales and
show that if there is too many bacteria from the land entering the river, the
river entirely fills with antibiotic resistant bacteria, while less frequent
influxes allows time for the bacteria to lose the antibiotic resistant gene.
This mathematically verifies that reduction in antibiotic use near the banks of
rivers, will reduce the counts of antibiotic resistant bacteria in rivers.

columns are radially arranged around singular points like the spokes of a
wheel, that are called pinwheels. The pinwheel structure has been observed
first with optical imaging techniques and more recently by in vivo two-photon
imaging proving their organization with single cell precision. In this research
we provide evidence that pinwheels are de facto optimal distributions for
coding at the best angular position and momentum. In the last years many
authors have recognized that the functional architecture of V1 is locally
invariant with respect to the symmetry group of rotations and translations
SE(2). In the present study we show that the orientation cortical maps used to
construct pinwheels can be modeled as coherent states, i.e. the configurations
best localized both in angular position and angular momentum. The theory we
adopt is based on the well known uncertainty principle, introduced by
Heisenberg in quantum mechanics and later extended to many other groups of
invariance. Here we state a corresponding principle in the cortical geometry
with SE(2) symmetry, and by computing its minimizers we obtain a model of
orientation activity maps in the cortex. As it is well known the pinwheels
configuration is directly constructed from these activity maps, and we will be
able to formally reproduce their structure starting from the group symmetries
of the functional architecture of the visual cortex. The primary visual cortex
is then modeled as an integrated system in which the set of simple cells
implements the SE(2) group, the horizontal connectivity implements its Lie
algebra and the pinwheels implement its minimal uncertainty states.

leads to quantitative changes compared to the original NJL model, the presence
of a repulsive vector-channel interaction has significant qualitative effects:
Whereas for homogeneous phases the first-order phase transition gets weakened
and eventually turns into a second-order transition or a cross-over, the domain
of inhomogeneous phases is less affected. In particular the location of the
Lifshitz point in terms of temperature and density is not modified.

Commonly, motility analysis is used to classify nematode movements and

been studied across a wide range of environments, including crawling on
substrates, swimming in fluids, and locomoting through microfluidic substrates.
However, each environment often requires customized image processing tools
relying on heuristic parameter tuning. In the present study, we propose a novel
Multi-Environment Model Estimation (MEME) framework for automated image
segmentation that is versatile across various environments. The MEME platform
is constructed around the concept of Mixture of Gaussian (MOG) models, where
statistical models for both the background environment and the nematode
appearance are explicitly learned and used to accurately segment a target
nematode. Our method is designed to simplify the burden often imposed on users;
here, only a single image which includes a nematode in its environment must be
provided for model learning. In addition, our platform enables the extraction
of nematode `skeletons' for straightforward motility quantification. We test
our algorithm on various locomotive environments and compare performances with
an intensity-based thresholding method. Overall, MEME outperforms the
threshold-based approach for the overwhelming majority of cases examined.
Ultimately, MEME provides researchers with an attractive platform for C.
elegans' segmentation and `skeletonizing' across a wide range of motility
assays.

a number of steps which is a constant proportion of the volume. We examine
geometric properties of the range, the random subgraph induced by the set of
vertices visited by the walk. Distance and mixing bounds for the typical range
are proven that are a $k$-iterated log factor from those on the full torus for
arbitrary $k$. The proof uses hierarchical renormalization and techniques that
can possibly be applied to other random processes in the Euclidean lattice. We
use the same technique to bound the heat kernel of a random walk on random
interlacements.

explains the anomalously large Cu-O vertical distance observed in the
experiments (~2.7 A) in terms of a peculiar frustration between two competing
local Cu-O environments characterized by different in-plane and out-of-plane
bond lengths and Cu electronic populations. The proper inclusion of substrate
effects is crucial to understand the tetragonal expansion and to reproduce
correctly the measured valence band spectrum for a CuO thickness of 3-3.5 unit
cells, in agreement with the experimentally estimated thickness.

quantum maps, a map with pseudointegrable dynamics and intermediate spectral
statistics, and a map with an Anderson-like transition recently implemented
with cold atoms. Using extensive numerical simulations, we compute the
multifractal exponents of quantum wave functions and study their properties,
with the help of two different numerical methods used for classical
multifractal systems (box-counting method and wavelet method). We compare the
results of the two methods over a wide range of values. We show that the wave
functions of the Anderson map display a multifractal behavior similar to
eigenfunctions of the three-dimensional Anderson transition but of a weaker
type. Wave functions of the intermediate map share some common properties with
eigenfunctions at the Anderson transition (two sets of multifractal exponents,
with similar asymptotic behavior), but other properties are markedly different
(large linear regime for multifractal exponents even for strong
multifractality, different distributions of moments of wave functions, absence
of symmetry of the exponents). Our results thus indicate that the intermediate
map presents original properties, different from certain characteristics of the
Anderson transition derived from the nonlinear sigma model. We also discuss the
importance of finite-size effects.

bound by semi realistic Minnesota nucleon-nucleon forces. The two-neutron
separation energy and the radius of the halo are reproduced in agreement with

  Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton 2010)",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A new variant of bit interleaved coded modulation (BICM) is proposed. In the
new scheme, called Parallel BICM, L identical binary codes are used in parallel
using a mapper, a newly proposed finite-length interleaver and a binary dither
signal. As opposed to previous approaches, the scheme does not rely on any
assumptions of an ideal, infinite-length interleaver. Over a memoryless
channel, the new scheme is proven to be equivalent to a binary memoryless
channel. Therefore the scheme enables one to easily design coded modulation
schemes using a simple binary code that was designed for that binary channel.
The overall performance of the coded modulation scheme is analytically
evaluated based on the performance of the binary code over the binary channel.
The new scheme is analyzed from an information theoretic viewpoint, where the
capacity, error exponent and channel dispersion are considered. The capacity of
the scheme is identical to the BICM capacity. The error exponent of the scheme
is numerically compared to a recently proposed mismatched-decoding exponent
analysis of BICM.

Bernstein wave (EBW) emission radiometer at the Mega Amp Spherical Tokamak

12,000 rpm and to avoid eddy current induced magnetic braking, the mirror
consists of a glass-reinforced nylon substrate of a special self-balanced
design, coated with a reflecting layer. By completing an angular scan every
2.5-10ms, it allows one to characterize with good time resolution the
Bernstein-extraordinary-ordinary mode-conversion efficiency as a function of
the view angles. Angular maps of conversion efficiency are directly related to
the magnetic pitch angle at the cutoff layer for the ordinary mode. Hence,
measurements at various frequencies provide the safety factor profile at the
plasma edge. Initial measurements and indications of the feasibility of the
diagnostic are presented. Moreover, angular scans indicate the best launch
conditions for EBW heating.

  by Bruno Nietlispach",,,,"math.CO math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Quasi-logarithmic combinatorial structures are a class of decomposable
combinatorial structures which extend the logarithmic class considered by
Arratia, Barbour and Tavar\'{e} (2003). In order to obtain asymptotic
approximations to their component spectrum, it is necessary first to establish
an approximation to the sum of an associated sequence of independent random
variables in terms of the Dickman distribution. This in turn requires an
argument that refines the Mineka coupling by incorporating a blocking
construction, leading to exponentially sharper coupling rates for the sums in
question. Applications include distributional limit theorems for the size of
the largest component and for the vector of counts of the small components in a
quasi-logarithmic combinatorial structure.
