microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarization in a characteristic way
containing valuable information for cosmological parameter estimation and weak
lensing reconstructions. So far, analytical expressions for the lensed CMB
power spectra assume the probability density function (PDF) of the lensing
excursion angle to be Gaussian. However, coherent light deflection by nonlinear
structures at low redshifts causes deviations from a pure Gaussian PDF. Working
in the flat-sky limit we develop a method for computing the lensed CMB power
spectra which takes these non-Gaussian features into account. Our method does
not assume any specific PDF but uses instead an expansion of the characteristic
function of the lensing excursion angle into its moments. Measuring these in
the CMB lensing deflection field obtained from the Millennium Simulation we
show that the change in the lensed power spectra is only at the 0.1% - 0.4%
level on very small scales (below 4 arcmin) and demonstrate that the assumption
of a Gaussian lensing excursion angle PDF is well applicable.

quality echelle spectra of the pair, obtained with HIRES on the Keck I

other quasar pairs, we conclude that the typical size (radius) of DLAs at these
redshifts is R ~ (5 +/- 3) kpc, smaller than previously realised. Highly
ionized gas associated with the DLA is more extended, as we find only small
differences in the C IV absorption profiles between the two sightlines.
  Coincident with UM 673B, we detect a weak and narrow Ly-alpha emission line

The DLA in UM 673A is metal-poor, with an overall metallicity Z_DLA ~ 1/30
Z_solar, and has a very low internal velocity dispersion. It exhibits some
apparent peculiarities in its detailed chemical composition, with the elements
Ti, Ni, and Zn being deficient relative to Fe by factors of 2-3. The [Zn/Fe]
ratio is lower than those measured in any other DLA or Galactic halo star,
presumably reflecting somewhat unusual previous enrichment by stellar
nucleosynthesis. We discuss the implications of these results for the nature of
the galaxy hosting the DLA.

flatness and homogeneity of the observable universe. In the context of
reversible (unitary) evolution, this goal is difficult to satisfy, as
Liouville's theorem implies that no dynamical process can evolve a large number

measure on solutions to Einstein's equation to quantify the problems of
cosmological fine-tuning. The most natural interpretation of the measure is the
flatness problem does not exist; almost all Robertson-Walker cosmologies are
spatially flat. The homogeneity of the early universe, however, does represent
a substantial fine-tuning; the horizon problem is real. When perturbations are
taken into account, inflation only occurs in a negligibly small fraction of
cosmological histories, less than $10^{-6.6\times 10^7}$. We argue that while
inflation does not affect the number of initial conditions that evolve into a
late universe like our own, it nevertheless provides an appealing target for
true theories of initial conditions, by allowing for small patches of space
with sub-Planckian curvature to grow into reasonable universes.

configurations resulting in strong dynamical interactions among the various

scattering events that eject one or more of the planets, and a collision of one

possibility that has seemingly been overlooked in the various scattering
calculations presented in the literature: the tidal capture of two planets
which leads to the formation of a binary planet (or binary brown dwarf) in
orbit about the parent star. We carry out extensive numerical simulations of
such dynamical and tidal interactions to explore the parameter space for the
formation of such binary planets. We show that tidal formation of binary
planets is possible for typical planet masses and distances from the host star.
The detection (or lack thereof) of planet-planet binaries can thus be used to
constrain the properties of planetary systems, including their mutual spacing
during formation, and the fraction of close planets in very eccentric orbits
which are believed to form by a closely related process.

Survey (EDisCS) at 0.4<z<0.8. The intrinsic colour scatter about the CMR is
very small (0.076) in rest-frame U-V. Only 7% of the galaxies are significantly
bluer than the CMR. The scarcity of blue S0s indicates that, if they are the
descendants of spirals, these were already red when they became S0s. We observe
no dependence of the CMR scatter with redshift or cluster velocity dispersion.
This implies that by the time cluster E/S0s achieve their morphology, the vast
majority have already joined the red sequence. We estimate the galaxy formation
redshift z_F for each cluster and find that it does not depend on the cluster
velocity dispersion. However, z_F increases weakly with cluster redshift. This
trend becomes clearer when including higher-z clusters from the literature,
suggesting that, at any given z, in order to have a population of fully-formed
E and S0s they needed to have formed most of their stars 2-4 Gyr prior to
observation. In other words, the galaxies that already have early-type (ET)
morphologies also have reasonably-old stellar populations. This is partly a
manifestation of the ""progenitor bias"", but also a consequence of the fact that
the vast majority of the ETs in clusters (in particular the massive ones) were
already red by the time they achieved their morphology. E and S0 galaxies
exhibit very similar colour scatter, implying similar stellar population ages.
We also find that fainter ETs finished forming their stars later, consistent
with the cluster red sequence being built over time and the brightest galaxies
reaching the red sequence earlier than fainter ones. Finally, we find that the
ET cluster galaxies must have had their star formation truncated over an
extended period of at least 1 Gyr. [abridged]

dynamical exponent z. We then use Einstein equations to relate the behavior of
the local speed of light in the bulk with the null energy condition (NEC) for
bulk matter, and we show that it is violated for Lifshitz backgrounds with z<1.
We study signal propagation in the gravity dual and show that violations of the
NEC are incompatible with causality in the strongly coupled theory, ruling out
as holographic models Lifshitz backgrounds with z<1. We argue that causality
violations in z<1 theories will show up in correlators as superluminal modes
and confirm this for a particular example with z=1/2. Finally, as an
application, we use z<1 solutions to uncover regions of the parameter space of
curvature squared corrections to gravity where the NEC can be violated.

of outliers. The best speed is achieved when the minimum possible number of
points is used to estimate hypotheses for the model. Many useful problems can
be represented using polynomial constraints (for instance, the determinant of a
fundamental matrix must be zero) and so have a number of solutions which are
consistent with a minimal set. A considerable amount of effort has been
expended on finding the constraints of such problems, and these often require
the solution of systems of polynomial equations. We show that better
performance can be achieved by using a simple optimization based approach on
minimal sets. For a given minimal set, the optimization approach is not
guaranteed to converge to the correct solution. However, when used within
RANSAC the greater speed and numerical stability results in better performance
overall, and much simpler algorithms. We also show that by selecting more than

opposite), as well as a gradient term in the local pressure, and the
corresponding dispersion relation for collective modes in bulk matter is
derived from relativistic fluid dynamics. A suitable two-phase equation of

of narrow absorption lines that potentially originate from the stellar
photosphere. The identification of these lines with particular atomic
transitions led to the measurement of the surface gravitational redshift of the
neutron star and to constraints on its mass and radius. However, the recent
detection of 552 Hz oscillations at 15% rms amplitude revealed the spin
frequency of the neutron star and brought into question the consistency of such
a rapid spin with the narrow width of the absorption lines. Here, we calculate
the amplitudes of burst oscillations and the width of absorption lines emerging
from the surface of a rapidly rotating neutron star for a wide range of model
parameters. We show that no combination of neutron-star and geometric
parameters can simultaneously reproduce the narrowness of the absorption lines,
the high amplitude of the oscillations, and the observed flux at the time the
oscillations were detected. We, therefore, conclude that the observed
absorption lines are unlikely to originate from the surface of this neutron
star.

studied extensively in the literature. Recently, the interest in this area has
been revived trough the anti-de-Sitter space/Conformal Field Theory
correspondence (AdS/CFT) with the difference that in this case the background
geometry is Anti de Sitter in five dimensions. In a recent project that we have
completed in the context of AdS/CFT, we have gained insight in the problem of
shockwaves and our goal in this work is to apply the technique we have
developed there in the case of ordinary gravity. In the current project, each
of the shockwaves correspond to a point-like Stress-Energy tensor that moves
with the speed of light while the collision is asymmetric and involves an
impact parameter (b). Our method is to expand the metric $(g_{\mu \nu})$ in the
background of flat space-time in the presence of the two shockwaves and compute
corrections that satisfy causal boundary conditions taking into account
back-reactions of the Stress-Energy tensor of the two point-like particles. Our
solution respects causality as expected but this casual dependence takes place
in an intuitive way. In particular, $g_{\mu \nu}$ at any given point $\vec{r}$
on the transverse plane at fixed $\tau$ evolves according from whether the
propagation from the center of each of the shockwaves or from both shockwaves
has enough proper time ($\tau$) to reach the point under consideration or not.
Simultaneously around the center of each shockwave, the future metric develops
a $\delta$-function profile with radius $\tau$; therefore this profile expands
outwards from the centers (of the shockwaves) with the speed of light. Finally,
we discuss the case of the zero impact parameter collision which results to the
violation of conservation and we argue that this might be a signal for the
formation of a black hole.

AGN hosts and non-AGN galaxies through the galaxy formation epoch in the
Chandra Deep Fields. We utilized analyses of color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) to
assess the role of moderate-luminosity AGNs in galaxy evolution. First, we
confirm some previous results and extend them to higher redshifts, e.g., there
is no apparent color bimodality for AGN hosts from z~0-2, but non-AGN galaxy
color bimodality exists up to z~3; most AGNs reside in massive hosts and the
AGN fraction rises strongly toward higher stellar mass up to z~2-3; and the
colors of both AGN hosts and non-AGN galaxies become redder as the stellar mass
increases up to z~2-3. Second, we point out that it is critical to use
mass-matched samples to examine color-magnitude relations of AGN hosts and
non-AGN galaxies. We show that for mass-matched samples up to z~2-3, AGN hosts
lie in the same CMD region as non-AGN galaxies; i.e., there is no specific
clustering of AGN hosts around the red sequence, the top of the blue cloud, or
the green valley in between. The AGN fraction (~10%) is mostly independent of
host-galaxy color, providing an indication of the duty cycle of SMBH growth in
typical massive galaxies. These results are in contrast to those obtained with
non-mass-matched samples where there is apparent AGN clustering in the CMD and
the AGN fraction generally increases as the color becomes redder. We also find,
for mass-matched samples, that the SFRs of AGN hosts are typically a factor of
~2-3 larger than those of non-AGN galaxies at z~0-1, whereas this difference
diminishes at z~1-3. Our results can be reasonably explained by two main
ingredients, color-mass correlation and passive or secular evolution of
galaxies; and thus tightly constrain any effects from moderate-luminosity AGN
feedback upon color-magnitude properties over the ~80% of cosmic time.

formation in massive cluster galaxies. At low redshifts (z < 1.3) our results
agree well with models with no mass assembly and passively evolving stellar
populations with a luminosity-weighted mean formation redshift zf=2.4 assuming
a Kroupa initial mass function (IMF). We conduct a thorough investigation of
systematic biases that might influence our results, and estimate systematic
uncertainites of Delta zf=(+0.16-0.18) (model normalization), Delta
zf=(+0.40-0.05) (alpha), and Delta zf=(+0.30-0.45) (choice of stellar

strongly constrained to be z ~2-3. Higher formation redshifts can only be made
consistent with the data if one permits an evolving IMF that is bottom-light at
high redshift, as suggested by van Dokkum et al 2008. At high redshift (z >
1.3) we also witness a statistically significant (>5sigma) disagreement between
the measured luminosity function and the continuation of the passive evolution
model from lower redshifts. After considering potential systematic biases that

deviation as potential evidence for ongoing mass assembly at this epoch.

never been determined directly from galaxy spectral energy distribution (SED)
observations over a wide redshift range. The evolving, overall spectrum of the
EBL is derived here utilizing a novel method based on observations only. This
is achieved from the observed evolution of the rest-frame K-band galaxy
luminosity function up to redshift 4 (Cirasuolo et al. 2010), combined with a
determination of galaxy SED-type fractions. These are based on fitting SWIRE
templates to a multiwavelength sample of about 6000 galaxies in the redshift
range from 0.2 to 1 from the All-wavelength Extended Groth Strip International
Survey (AEGIS). The changing fractions of quiescent galaxies, star-forming
galaxies, starburst galaxies and AGN galaxies in that redshift range are
estimated, and two alternative extrapolations of SED-types to higher redshifts
are considered. This allows calculation of the evolution of the luminosity
densities from the UV to the IR, the evolving star formation rate density of
the universe, the evolving contribution to the bolometric EBL from the
different galaxy populations including AGN galaxies and the buildup of the EBL.
Our EBL calculations are compared with those from a semi-analytic model, from
another observationally-based model and observational data. The EBL
uncertainties in our modeling based directly on the data are quantified, and
their consequences for attenuation of very high energy gamma-rays due to pair
production on the EBL are discussed. It is concluded that the EBL is well
constrained from the UV to the mid-IR, but independent efforts from infrared
and gamma-ray astronomy are needed in order to reduce the uncertainties in the
far-IR.

and k-inflation is known to admit a separable form of the estimator for CMB
anisotropies. We show that this shape is $87 \%$ correlated with the full

correlated with the one in multi-field DBI inflation when curvature
perturbation is originated from purely entropic contribution. This suggests
that $g_{\rm NL} ^{equil}$, the amplitude of this particular shape, provides a
reasonable measure of the non-Gaussianity from the trispectrum in equilateral
non-Gaussian models. We relate model parameters such as the sound speed, $c_s$
and the transfer coefficient from entropy perturbations to the curvature
perturbation, $T_{\mathcal{R} S}$ with $g_{\rm NL} ^{equil}$, which enables us
to constrain model parameters in these models once $g_{\rm NL}^{equil}$ is

efficiencies cannot reproduce the observed trend of SSFR with stellar mass and
its observed lack of evolution at $z>4$. Model galaxies with $\log(M_*) \ltsim
9.5$ M$_{\odot}$ show systematically lower specific star formation rates by
orders of magnitudes, while massive galaxies with M$_* \gtsim 5 \times 10^{10}$
M$_{\odot}$ have up to an order of magnitude larger SSFRs, compared to recent
observations by Stark et al.. To recover these observations we apply an
empirical star formation efficiency in galaxies that scales with the host halo
velocity dispersion as $\propto 1/\sigma^3$ during galaxy mergers. We find that
this modification needs to be of stochastic nature to reproduce the
observations, i.e. only applied during mergers and not during accretion driven
star formation phases. Our choice of star formation efficiency during mergers
allows us to capture both, the boost in star formation at low masses and the
quenching at high masses, and at the same time produce a constant SSFR-stellar
mass relation at $z\gtsim 4$ under the assumption that most of the observed
galaxies are in a merger triggered star formation phase. Our results suggest
that observed high-z low mass galaxies with high SSFRs are likely to be
frequently interacting systems, which experienced bursts in their star
formation rate and efficiency (mode 1), in contrast to low redshift $z \ltsim

Kuiper Belt (KB) are binaries with comparable mass and wide separation of
components. A favored model for their formation was capture during the
coagulation growth of bodies in the early KB. Instead, recent studies suggested
that large objects can rapidly form in the protoplanetary disks when swarms of
locally concentrated solids collapse under their own gravity. Here we examine
the possibility that KB binaries formed during gravitational collapse when the
excess of angular momentum prevented the agglomeration of available mass into a
solitary object. We find that this new mechanism provides a robust path toward
the formation of KB binaries with observed properties, and can explain wide
systems such as 2001 QW322 and multiples such as (47171) 1999 TC36. Notably,
the gravitational collapse is capable of producing 100% binary fraction for a
wide range of the swarm's initial angular momentum values. The binary
components have similar masses (80% have the secondary-over-primary radius
ratio >0.7) and their separation ranges from ~1,000 to ~100,000 km. The binary
orbits have eccentricities from e=0 to ~1, with the majority having e<0.6. The
binary orbit inclinations with respect to the initial angular momentum of the
swarm range from i=0 to ~90 deg, with most cases having i<50 deg. Our binary
formation mechanism implies that the primary and secondary components in each
binary pair should have identical bulk composition, which is consistent with
the current photometric data. We discuss the applicability of our results to
the Pluto-Charon, Orcus-Vanth, (617) Patroclus-Menoetius and (90) Antiope

Ultimately, the system is predicted to make a quantum phase transition to
various highly correlated many-body states (analogous to bosonic quantum Hall

models in the literature that account for this aspect. However, none is
designed to simultaneously explain the presence of powerful jets detected
during these states. A new quasi-keplerian hot accretion disc solution, a Jet
Emitting disc (JED hereafter), which is part of a global disc-jet MHD structure
producing stationary super-alfv\'enic ejection, is investigated here. Its
radiative and energetic properties are then compared to the observational
constraints found in Cygnus X-1. We solve the disc energy equation by balancing
the local heating term with advection and cooling by synchrotron,
bremsstrahlung and Comptonization processes. The heating term, disc density,
accretion velocity and magnetic field amplitude were taken from published
self-similar models of accretion-ejection structures. Both optically thin and
thick regimes are considered in a one temperature gas supported disc. Three
branches of solutions are found possible at a given radius but we investigate
only the hot, optically thin and geometrically slim solutions. These solutions
give simultaneously, and in a consistent way, the radiative and energetics
properties of the disc-jet system. They are able to very well reproduce the
accretion-ejection properties of Cygnus X-1, namely its X-ray spectral
emission, jet power and jet velocity. About half of the released accretion
power is used to produce two mildly relativistic (v/c~0.5) jets and for a
luminosity of the order of 1\% of the Eddington luminosity, the JED temperature
and optical depth are close to that observed in the hard state Cygnus X-1. The

tidal mass stripping removes a large fraction of the original angular momentum

construct infinite finitely generated residually finite $p$-torsion groups in

these groups can be thought of as residually finite analogues of Tarski

All the computational results indicate that the Co2+ ion is in a high-spin
state and the Co3+ in a low-spin state. The Co2+ t2g orbitals with a small
crystal-field splitting are mixed by spin-orbit coupling, which accounts for
the observed easy in-plane magnetism. The nonmagnetic LS-Co3+ state, which is
stabilized by a strong crystal field, provides a natural explanation for the
observed low magnetic ordering temperature and a spin-blockade phenomenon of
the electron hopping. Furthermore, we find that the intermediate-spin state of
Co3+ has a large multiplet splitting. But the lowest-lying IS state of Co3+ is
still higher in energy than the LS ground state by a few hundred millielectron
volts and the HS state of Co3+ is even less stable, both in sharp contrast to a
recent experimental study which suggested the HS+IS mixed Co3+ ground state. We
note that either the IS-Co3+ or HS-Co3+ states or their mixture would produce a
wrong out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy and a much higher magneticordering
temperature than observed. Thus, the present work sheds light on this material
concerning its electronic and magnetic structure, and it would stimulate
different experiments to settle this intriguing spin-state issue.

the self similar transformations, and define a fractal dimension of an ordered
block, which minimum corresponds to a fixed point of the transformations. By
the connectivity we divide the blocks into two types: irreducible and
reducible. We find there are two block spin states: single state and k-fold
state, each of which relates to a system or a subsystem described by a block
spin Gaussian model set up by mathematic map. Using the model we obtain a
universal formula of critical points by the minimal fractal dimensions. We
computed the critical points with high accuracy for three Ising models. It is

causes fluctuations, and the point acts as a fluctuation attractor. Finally, we

quantum communication and quantum computing. The realization of the two is
difficult because quantum information inherently has a high susceptibility to
decoherence, i.e. to uncontrollable information loss to the environment. For
entanglement distribution, a proposed solution to this problem is capable of
fully eliminating decoherence; namely iterative entanglement distillation. This
approach builds on a large number of distillation steps each of which extracts
a number of weakly decohered entangled states from a larger number of strongly
decohered states. Here, for the first time, we experimentally demonstrate
iterative distillation of entanglement. Already distilled entangled states were
further improved in a second distillation step and also made available for
subsequent steps.Our experiment displays the realization of the building blocks
required for an entanglement distillation scheme that can fully eliminate
decoherence.

proposed and is applied to realize the slow roll inflation in Einstein frame.
Because inflation deals with Planck scale physics, the dilaton can be a strong
candidate for identification with the inflaton. The model we used, cleared the
$\eta$-problem and negative energy problem of potential at stable point, and
appeared to predict successfully the values of observations at the inflation
era.
  We proved that the model explains WMAP observations appropriately. Moreover,
a mechanism of SSB and Gravitino production just after the end of inflation is
investigated. We have obtained power spectrum of the density perturbation as
$\mathcal{P_R}_* \sim 2.438 \times 10^{-9}$ and the scalar spectral index as
$n_{s*}\sim 0.9746$ and its tilt as $\alpha_{s*}\sim -4.3 \times 10^{-4}$. The
ratio between scalar power spectrum and tensor is predicted as $r\sim 6.8
\times 10^{-2}$, a prediction which seems in the range possibly observed by the
Planck satellite soon. The gravitino mass and their production rate from scalar
fields are estimated at certain values of parameters in the model. The
reheating temperature is estimated by the stability condition of Boltzmann
equation by using the decay rate of the dilaton S into gauginos as $T_R({\rm
gaugino}) = 3.88 \times 10^{7} \,\, {\rm GeV}$. Though only one example of
parameter choices has been discussed here, the other seven candidates of
parameter choices that are compatible with WMAP data have already been found by
the authors. Some of the examples show that the gauginos can be observed by LHC
experiments. The plausible supergravity model of inflation which here we
described will open the hope to construct a realistic theory of particle theory
and cosmology in this framework.

70 M_Jup can have fields of a few kilo-Gauss during the first few hundred
Million years. These fields can grow by a factor of two before they weaken
after deuterium burning has stopped. Brown dwarfs with weak deuterium burning
and extrasolar giant planets start with magnetic fields between ~100G and ~1kG
at the age of a few Myr, depending on their mass. Their magnetic field weakens
steadily until after 10Gyr it has shrunk by about a factor of 10. We use
observed X-ray luminosities to estimate the age of the known extrasolar giant
planets that are more massive than 0.3M_Jup and closer than 20pc. Taking into
account the age estimate, and assuming sun-like wind-properties and radio
emission processes similar to those at Jupiter, we calculate their radio flux

frequency around 150MHz for $\tau$Boob, but the flux is below 60mJy for the
rest. Most planets are expected to emit radiation between a few Mhz and up to
100MHz, well above the ionospheric cutoff frequency.

a result, we find that the higher step RSB ansatz is useful for describing
spin-glass phases in this system. For investigating the nature of the higher

implemented to other mean-field spin models than the GREM. Such models with

entire circumstellar envelope of chi Cyg. The data were obtained using the HIFI
instrument aboard Herschel, whose high spectral resolution provides valuable
information about the line profiles. Detailed, non-LTE, radiative transfer
modelling, including dust radiative transfer coupled with a dynamical model,
has been performed to derive the temperature, density, and velocity structure
of the circumstellar envelope. We report the first detection of circumstellar

the parameters for the circumstellar envelope, we modelled both the ortho- and

structure expected for a dust-driven wind. The derived total H2O abundance
(relative to H2) is (1.1 +/- 0.2)E-5, much lower than that in O-rich stars. The

components that are inconspicuous in widely used molecular tracers such as CO.
We present Herschel/HIFI observations of CH toward NGC6334I observed as part of
the CHESS key program. HIFI resolves the hyperfine components of its J=3/2-1/2
transition, observed in both emission and absorption. The CH emission appears
close to the systemic velocity of NGC6334I, while its measured linewidth of 3
km/s is smaller than previously observed in dense gas tracers such as NH3 and
SiO. The CH abundance in the hot core is 7 10^-11, two to three orders of
magnitude lower than in diffuse clouds. While other studies find distinct
outflows in, e.g., CO and H2O toward NGC6334I, we do not detect outflow
signatures in CH. To explain the absorption signatures, at least two absorbing
components are needed at -3.0 and +6.5 km/s with N(CH)=7 10^13 and 3 10^13
cm^-2. Two additional absorbing clouds are found at +8.0 and 0.0 km/s, both
with N(CH)=2 10^13 cm^-2. Turbulent linewidths for the four absorption
components vary between 1.5 and 5.0 km/s in FWHM. We constrain physical
properties of our CH clouds by matching our CH absorbers with other absorption
signatures. In the hot core, molecules such as H2O and CO trace gas that is
heated and dynamically influenced by outflow activity, whereas CH traces more
quiescent material. The four CH absorbers have column densities and turbulent
properties consistent with diffuse clouds: two are located near NGC6334, and
two are unrelated foreground clouds. Local density and dynamical effects
influence the chemical composition of physical components of NGC6334, causing
some components to be seen in CH but not in other tracers, and vice versa.

can, both statistically and individually, return important clues about the
structural properties of the most massive structures in the Universe.
Substantial work is ongoing in order to understand the degree of similarity
between the lensing cluster population and the population of clusters as a
whole, with members of the former being likely more massive, compact, and
substructured than members of the latter. In this work we exploit synthetic
clusters extracted from the {\sc MareNostrum Universe} cosmological simulation
in order to estimate the correlation between the strong lensing efficiency and
other bulk properties of lensing clusters, such as the virial mass and the
bolometric X-ray luminosity. We found that a positive correlation exist between
all these quantities, with the substantial scatter being smaller for the
luminosity-cross section relation. We additionally used the relation between
the lensing efficiency and the virial mass in order to construct a synthetic
optical depth that agrees well with the true one, while being extremely faster
to be evaluated. We finally estimated what fraction of the total giant arc
abundance is recovered when galaxy clusters are selected according to their
dynamical activity or their X-ray luminosity. Our results show that there is a
high probability for high-redshift strong lensing clusters to be substantially
far away from dynamical equilibrium, and that $30-40\%$ of the total amount of
giant arcs are lost if looking only at very X-ray luminous objects.

pronounced torsion angles of the phenyl rings with respect to the plane of the

the Peccei-Quinn phase transition can remain after inflation well above the
Peccei-Quinn scale thanks to (i) its participation in the supergravity and
logarithmic corrections during the inflationary stage and (ii) the high reheat
temperature after the same period. As a consequence, its presence influences
drastically the inflationary dynamics and the universe suffers a second period
of reheating after the Peccei-Quinn phase transition. Confronting our
inflationary predictions with the current observational data, we find that, for
about the central value of the spectral index, the grand unification scale can
be identified with its supersymmetric value for the relevant coupling constant
\kappa=0.002 and, more or less, natural values, +/-(0.01-0.1), for the

particularly in the warm ones, which cannot be properly studied from the
low-energy lines.
  The 12CO J=16-15, 10-9, and 6-5 lines are easily detected in this source.
13CO J=10-9 and 6-5 are also detected. Wide profiles showing spectacular line
wings have been found, particularly in 12CO 16-15. Other lines observed
simultaneously with CO are also shown. Our analysis of the CO high-J
transitions, when compared with the existing models, confirms the very low
expansion velocity of the central, dense component, which probably indicates
that the shells ejected during the last AGB phases were driven by radiation
pressure under a regime of maximum transfer of momentum. No contribution of the
diffuse halo found from mm-wave data is identified in our spectra, because of
its low temperature. We find that the fast bipolar outflow is quite hot, much
hotter than previously estimated; for instance, gas flowing at 100 km/s must
have a temperature higher than ~ 200 K. Probably, this very fast outflow, with
a kinematic age < 100 yr, has been accelerated by a shock and has not yet
cooled down. The double empty shell found from mm-wave mapping must also be
relatively hot, in agreement with the previous estimate.

nanomechanical resonators. Relevant examples are the investigation of quantum
effects in mechanical systems [1] or the detection of exceedingly small forces
as in Magnetic Resonance Force Microscopy (MRFM) [2]. The force sensitivity of
a mechanical resonator is typically limited by thermal fluctuations, which
calls for detection methods capable of operating at ultralow temperature.
Commonly used interferometric techniques, despite their excellent sensitivity,
may not be an optimal choice at millikelvin temperatures, because of unwanted
resonator heating caused by photon absorption. Although alternative detection
techniques based on microwave cavities [3] [4] [5] have shown to perform better
at ultralow temperature, these techniques still suffer from the fact that the
detection sensitivity decreases as the power input is decreased. Here, we
present a measurement approach based on the detection, through a
Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID), of the change of magnetic
flux induced in a coil by the motion of a magnetic particle attached to a
resonator. This detection scheme avoids direct heating of the resonator, as it
does not involve reflecting optical or microwave photons to the resonator. By
cooling an ultrasoft silicon resonator to 25 mK, we achieve a force noise of
0.5 aN in a 1 Hz bandwidth. We believe this detection technique can in
principle be used even at sub-millikelvin temperatures. Furthermore, it could
be used to improve the sensitivity of MRFM experiments, which aim at three
dimensional imaging at atomic resolution.

to the lattice pressure at high temperature for SU(3) Yang-Mills case, we have
reproduced well our analytical curves and numbers not only for the pressure but
for all other independent thermodynamic quantities as well in the whole
temperature range $[0, \infty)$. We explicitly show that the pressure is a
continuous function of the temperature across a phase transition at $T_c =
266.5 \MeV$. The entropy and energy densities have finite jump discontinuities
at $T_c$ with latent heat $\epsilon_{LH}= 1.414$. This is a firm evidence of
the first-order phase transition in SU(3) pure gluon plasma. The heat capacity
has a $\delta$-type singularity (an essential discontinuity) at $T_c$, so that
the velocity of sound squared becomes zero at this point. All the independent
thermodynamic quantities are exponentially suppressed below $T_c$ and rather
slowly approach their respective Stefan-Boltzmann limits at high temperatures.
Those thermodynamic quantities which are the ratios of their independent
counterparts such as conformity, conformality and the velocity of sound squared
approach their Stefan-Boltzmann limit at high temperatures rather rapidly and
demonstrate the non-trivial dependence on the temperature below $T_c$. We
predict the existence of the three massive and the two massless excitations,
all of non-perturbative dynamical origin. One of the massive excitations has an
effective mass $1.17 \GeV$ and the two others have the same effective mass
$0.585 \GeV$, but are propagating in different ways.

important. The point source approximation commonly used can cause biased
results. 2) The widely used R_cusp statistic is sensitive to halo ellipticity
as well as the lens' substructure content. 3) For compact substructure, we find
new upper bounds on the amount of substructure from the the fact that no simple
single-galaxy lenses have been observed with a single source having more than
four well separated images. 4) The frequency of image flux anomalies is largely
dependent on the total surface mass density in substructures and the size--mass
relation for the substructures, and not on the range of substructure masses. 5)
Substructure models with the same size--mass relation produce similar numbers
of flux anomalies even when their internal mass profiles are different. 6) The
lack of high image multiplicity lenses puts a limit on a combination of the
substructures' size--mass relation, surface density and mass. 7) Substructures
with shallower mass profiles and/or larger sizes produce less extra images. 8)

consistent with \LambdaCDM Nbody simulations.

starts a random walk. When an informed agent meets an uninformed agent, the
latter becomes informed and starts a new random walk. We study the broadcasting

0 and all agents start random walks. When two agents meet, they share all
rumors they are aware of. We study the gossiping time of the system, that is,
the time it takes for all agents to know all rumors. We prove that both the

results for the grid provided bounds which were weaker and only concerned

that static and dynamically moving agents are infected at about the same speed.

that such power control can improve the network capacity significantly. We
study this problem in the physical interference model using SINR constraints.
  In the SINR capacity maximization problem, we are given n pairs of senders
and receivers, located in a metric space (usually a so-called fading metric).
The algorithm shall select a subset of these pairs and choose a power level for
each of them with the objective of maximizing the number of simultaneous
communications. This is, the selected pairs have to satisfy the SINR
constraints with respect to the chosen powers.
  We present the first algorithm achieving a constant-factor approximation in
fading metrics. The best previous results depend on further network parameters
such as the ratio of the maximum and the minimum distance between a sender and
its receiver. Expressed only in terms of n, they are (trivial) Omega(n)
approximations.
  Our algorithm still achieves an O(log n) approximation if we only assume to
have a general metric space rather than a fading metric. Furthermore, by using
standard techniques the algorithm can also be used in single-hop and multi-hop
scheduling scenarios. Here, we also get polylog(n) approximations.

  Semiconductors","Accepted by Phys. Rev. B (2010)","Phys. Rev. B 82, 085202 (2010)","10.1103/PhysRevB.82.085202",,"cond-mat.mes-hall cond-mat.dis-nn cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Linear magnetoresistance occurs in semiconductors as a consequence of strong
electrical disorder and is characterized by nonsaturating magnetoresistance
that is proportional to the applied magnetic field. By investigating a
disordered MnAs-GaAs composite material, it is found that the magnitude of the
linear magnetoresistance (LMR) is numerically equal to the carrier mobility
over a wide range and is independent of carrier density. This behavior is
complementary to the Hall effect that is independent of the mobility and
dependent on the carrier density. Moreover, the LMR appears to be insensitive
to the details of the disorder and points to a universal explanation of
classical LMR that can be applied to other material systems.

for beyond the standard model building, e.g. Technicolour, using the criteria
of metric confinement and causal analytic couplings, which are known to be
consistent with the phase diagram of supersymmetric QCD from Seiberg duality.
Using these criteria we find perturbation theory to be consistent throughout
the predicted conformal window for several of these gauge theories and we
discuss recent lattice results in the light of our findings.

maximum of the average degrees of all subgraphs of $G$. It is clear that any
graph $G$ with maximum degree $\Delta(G)$ satisfies $\lcl(G)\ge
\ceil{\Delta(G)/2}+1$. In this paper, we prove the following results: (1) if
$\mad(G)<12/5$ and $\Delta(G)\ge 3$, then $\lcl(G)=\ceil{\Delta(G)/2}+1$, and
we give an infinite family of examples to show that this result is best
possible; (2) if $\mad(G)<3$ and $\Delta(G)\ge 9$, then
$\lcl(G)\le\ceil{\Delta(G)/2}+2$, and we give an infinite family of examples to
show that the bound on $\mad(G)$ cannot be increased in general; (3) if $G$ is
planar and has girth at least 5, then $\lcl(G)\le\ceil{\Delta(G)/2}+4$.

  0226-0238",,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Quantum key distribution (QKD) relies on quantum and classical procedures in
order to achieve the growing of a secret random string -the key- known only to
the two parties executing the protocol. Limited intrinsic efficiency of the
protocol, imperfect devices and eavesdropping produce errors and information
leakage from which the set of measured signals -the raw key- must be stripped
in order to distill a final, information theoretically secure, key. The key
distillation process is a classical one in which basis reconciliation, error
correction and privacy amplification protocols are applied to the raw key. This
cleaning process is known as information reconciliation and must be done in a
fast and efficient way to avoid cramping the performance of the QKD system.
Brassard and Salvail proposed a very simple and elegant protocol to reconcile
keys in the secret-key agreement context, known as Cascade, that has become the
de-facto standard for all QKD practical implementations. However, it is highly
interactive, requiring many communications between the legitimate parties and
its efficiency is not optimal, imposing an early limit to the maximum tolerable
error rate. In this paper we describe a low-density parity-check reconciliation
protocol that improves significantly on these problems. The protocol exhibits
better efficiency and limits the number of uses of the communications channel.
It is also able to adapt to different error rates while remaining efficient,
thus reaching longer distances or higher secure key rate for a given QKD
system.
