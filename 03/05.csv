studied using local three dimensional numerical simulations employing the
shearing box approximation. We determine the turbulent viscosity from
non-rotating runs over a range of values of the shear parameter and use a
simple analytical model in order to extract the non-diffusive contribution
(Lambda-effect) to the stress in runs where rotation is included. Our results
suggest that the turbulent viscosity is of the order of the mixing length
estimate and weakly affected by rotation. The Lambda-effect is non-zero and a
factor of 2-4 smaller than the turbulent viscosity in the slow rotation regime.
We demonstrate that for Keplerian shear, the angular momentum transport can
change sign and be outward when the rotation period is greater than the
turnover time, i.e. when the Coriolis number is below unity. This result seems
to be relatively independent of the value of the Rayleigh number.

(EoR) project is to measure the power spectrum of variations in the intensity
of redshifted 21-cm radiation from the EoR. The sensitivity with which this
power spectrum can be estimated depends on the level of thermal noise and
sample variance, and also on the systematic errors arising from the extraction
process, in particular from the subtraction of foreground contamination. We
model the extraction process using realistic simulations of the cosmological
signal, the foregrounds and noise, and so estimate the sensitivity of the LOFAR
EoR experiment to the redshifted 21-cm power spectrum. Detection of emission
from the EoR should be possible within 360 hours of observation with a single
station beam. Integrating for longer, and synthesizing multiple station beams
within the primary (tile) beam, then enables us to extract progressively more
accurate estimates of the power at a greater range of scales and redshifts. We
discuss different observational strategies which compromise between depth of
observation, sky coverage and frequency coverage. A plan in which lower
frequencies receive a larger fraction of the time appears to be promising. We
also study the nature of the bias which foreground fitting errors induce on the
inferred power spectrum, and discuss how to reduce and correct for this bias.
The angular and line-of-sight power spectra have different merits in this
respect, and we suggest considering them separately in the analysis of LOFAR
data.

a black hole, developed by Novikov & Thorne (NT) in 1973, assumes the shear
stress vanishes at the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and
that, outside the ISCO, the shear stress is produced by an effective turbulent
viscosity. However, astrophysical accretion disks are not razor-thin, it is
uncertain whether the shear stress necessarily vanishes at the ISCO, and the
magnetic field, which is thought to drive turbulence in disks, may contain
large-scale structures that do not behave like a simple local scalar viscosity.
We describe three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic
simulations of accretion disks around black holes with a range of spin
parameters, and we use the simulations to assess the validity of the NT model.
Our fiducial initial magnetic field consists of multiple (alternating polarity)
poloidal field loops whose shape is roughly isotropic in the disk in order to
match the isotropic turbulence expected in the poloidal plane. For a thin disk
with an aspect ratio |h/r| ~ 0.07 around a non-spinning black hole, we find a
decrease in the accreted specific angular momentum of 2.9% relative to the NT
model and an excess luminosity from inside the ISCO of 3.5%. The deviations in
the case of spinning black holes are of the same order. In addition, the
deviations decrease with decreasing |h/r|. We therefore conclude that
magnetized thin accretion disks in x-ray binaries in the thermal/high-soft
spectral state ought to be well-described by the NT model, especially at
luminosities below 30% of Eddington where we expect a very small disk thickness
|h/r| <~ 0.05. We also discuss how the stress and the luminosity inside the
ISCO depend on the assumed initial magnetic field geometry. (abridged)

cosmological N-body simulations are used to calculate the complete non-linear
evolution of the peculiar gravitational potential. Tracing light rays back
through the past lightcone of a chosen observer accurately captures the
temperature perturbations generated by linear (the integrated Sachs-Wolfe or
ISW effect) and non-linear (the Rees-Sciama or RS effect) evolution. These
effects give rise to three kinds of non-linear features in the temperature
maps. (a) In overdense regions, converging flows of matter induce cold spots of
order 100 Mpc in extent which can dominate over the ISW effect at high
redshift, and are surrounded by hot rings. (b) In underdense regions, the RS
effect enhances ISW cold spots which can be surrounded by weak hot rings. (c)
Transverse motions of large lumps of matter produce characteristic dipole
features, consisting of adjacent hot and cold spots separated by a few tens of
Megaparsecs. These non-linear features are not easily detectable; they modulate
the ISW sky maps at about the 10 percent level. The RS effect causes the
angular power spectrum to deviate from linear theory at l~50 and generates
non-Gaussianity, skewing the one-point distribution function to negative
values. Cold spots of similar angular size, but much smaller amplitude than the
CMB cold spot reported by Cruz et al. are produced. Joint analysis of our maps
and the corresponding galaxy distribution may enable techniques to be developed

detected in all systems that are manifestly undergoing a merger event in the
plane of the sky while the presence of such features in the remaining clusters
is related to the presence of a steep entropy gradient, in agreement with

restriction to the Gribov region is implemented by a local, renormalizable

of (mass)$^4$, whose value is fixed in terms of $\Lambda_{QCD}$, by the gap
equation, known as the horizon condition, ${\p \Gamma \over \p \gamma} = 0$,
where $\Gamma$ is the quantum effective action. The restriction to the Gribov
region suppresses gluons in the infrared, which nicely explains why gluons are
not in the physical spectrum, but this only makes makes more mysterious the
origin of the long-range force between quarks. In the present article we
exhibit the symmetries of $\Gamma$, and show that the solution to the gap
equation, which defines the classical vacuum, spontaneously breaks some of the
symmetries $\Gamma$. This implies the existence of massless Goldstone bosons
and fermions that do not appear in the physical spectrum. Some of the Goldstone
bosons may be exchanged between quarks, and are candidates for a long-range

incorporate using a recently proposed model) produces the time increase of the

the nominal contact area. For an uncorrelated surface topography, the time
evolution of $A(t)$ is numerically found to be well fitted by expressions of

the normal load $F_N$ as $q\sim F_N^{\beta}$, with $\beta$ close to 0.5. In

$A(t)/A(0) \sim 1+C\ln(t/t_0+1)$, i.e., a logarithmic time increase of the

increase for low loads is also obtained analytically in this case. For the more

the Sun by using a seismic-holography technique. As in previous works, the
method is based on the comparison of waves going in and out of a particular
point in the Sun but we have computed here the Green's functions from a
spherical polar expansion of the adiabatic wave equations in the Cowling
approximation instead of using the ray-path approximation previously used in
the far-side holography. A comparison between the results obtained using the
ray theory and the spherical polar expansion is shown. We use the
gravito-acoustic wave equation in the local plane-parallel limit in both cases
and for the latter we take the asymptotic approximation for the radial
dependencies of the Green's function. As a result, improved images of the
far-side can be obtained from the polar-expansion approximation, especially
when combining the Green's functions corresponding to two and three skips. We
also show that the phase corrections in the Green's functions due to the
incorrect modeling of the uppermost layers of the Sun can be estimated from the
eigenfrequencies of the normal modes of oscillation.

a super massive black hole (SMBH) and its host galaxy evolution, by means of 1D
hydrodynamical simulations that include both mechanical and radiative AGN
feedback effects. By changing the truncation radius of the gas distribution
(R_t), beyond which gas stripping is assumed to be effective, we simulate
possible environments for satellite and central galaxies in galaxy clusters and
groups. The continuous escape of gas outside the truncation radius strongly
suppresses star formation, while the growth of the SMBH is less affected by gas
stripping because the SMBH accretion is primarily ruled by the density of the
central region. As we allow for increasing environmental effects - the
truncation radius decreasing from about 410 to 50 kpc - we find that the final
SMBH mass declines from about 10^9 to 8 x 10^8 Msol, but the outflowing mass is
roughly constant at about 2 x 10^10 Msol. There are larger change in the mass
of stars formed, which declines from about 2 x 10^10 to 2 x 10^9 Msol, and the
final thermal X-ray gas, which declines from about 10^9 to 5 x 10^8 Msol, with
increasing environmental stripping. Most dramatic is the decline in the total
time that the objects would be seen as quasars, which declines from 52 Myr (for
R_t = 377 kpc) to 7.9 Myr (for R_t = 51 kpc). The typical case might be
interpreted as a red and dead galaxy having episodic cooling flows followed by
AGN feedback effects resulting in temporary transitions of the overall galaxy
color from red to green or to blue, with (cluster) central galaxies spending a
much larger fraction of their time in the elevated state than do satellite

remains unclear whether the observed high-energy electrons and positrons are
produced by relic particles, or by some astrophysical sources. To distinguish
between the two possibilities, one can compare the electron population in the
local neighborhood with that in the dwarf spheroidal galaxies, which are not
expected to host as many pulsars and other astrophysical sources. This can be
accomplished using X-ray and gamma-ray observations of dwarf spheroidal
galaxies. Assuming the signal detected by Fermi and ATIC comes from dark matter
and using the inferred dark matter profile of the Draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy
as an example, we calculate the photon spectrum produced by electrons via
inverse Compton scattering. Since little is known about the magnetic fields in
dwarf spheroidal galaxies, we consider the propagation of charged particles
with and without diffusion. Extending the analysis of Fermi collaboration for
Draco, we find that for a halo mass ~ 1 billion Solar masses, even in the
absence of diffusion, the gamma-ray signal would be above the upper limits.
This conclusion is subject to uncertainties associated with the halo mass. If
dwarf spheroidal galaxies host local magnetic fields, the diffusion of the
electrons can result in a signal detectable by future X-ray telescopes.

context of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Although commonly used in a wide range of
analytical and numerical studies, the equation of state (EOS) with a constant
adiabatic index is a poor approximation for relativistic hydrodynamics.
Adopting a more realistic EOS with a variable adiabatic index, we present a
simple form of jump conditions for relativistic hydrodynamical shocks. Then we
describe in detail our technique of modeling a very general class of GRB blast
waves with a long-lived reverse shock. Our technique admits an arbitrary radial
stratification of the ejecta and ambient medium. We use two different methods
to find dynamics of the blast wave: (1) customary pressure balance across the
blast wave and (2) the ""mechanical model"". Using a simple example model, we
demonstrate that the two methods yield significantly different dynamical
evolutions of the blast wave. We show that the pressure balance does not
satisfy the energy conservation for an adiabatic blast wave while the
mechanical model does. We also compare two sets of afterglow light curves
obtained with the two different methods.

reside. We characterise the environment using the largest group catalogue,
based on 3D data, generated from SDSS at low redshift ($z < 0.1$). We find that
the intercept $``c''$ of the FP decreases smoothly from high to low density
regions, implying that galaxies at low density have on average lower
mass-to-light ratios than their high-density counterparts. The $``c''$ also
decreases as a function of the mean characteristic mass of the parent galaxy
group. However, this trend is weak and completely accounted for by the
variation of $``c''$ with local density. The variation of the FP offset is the
same in all wavebands, implying that ETGs at low density have younger
luminosity-weighted ages than cluster galaxies, consistent with the
expectations of semi-analytical models of galaxy formation. We measure an age
variation of $\sim 0.048$~dex ($\sim 11\%$) per decade of local galaxy density.
This implies an age difference of about $32 \%$ ($\sim 3 \, Gyr$) between
galaxies in the regions of highest density and the field. We find the
metallicity decreasing, at $\sim 2$~$\sigma$, from low to high density. We also
find $2.5 \, \sigma$ evidence that the variation in age per decade of local
density augments, up to a factor of two, for galaxies residing in massive

in implicit solvent, widely used to access the microscopic transitions in

two main approaches for implementation of random number generators (RNGs) on a
GPU, which enable one to generate random numbers on the fly. In the
one-RNG-per-thread approach, inherent in CPU-based calculations, one RNG
produces a stream of random numbers in each thread of execution, whereas the
one-RNG-for-all-threads approach builds on the ability of different threads to
communicate, thus, sharing random seeds across the entire GPU device. We
exemplify the use of these approaches through the development of Ran2, Hybrid
Taus, and Lagged Fibonacci algorithms fully implemented on the GPU. As an
application-based test of randomness, we carry out LD simulations of N
independent harmonic oscillators coupled to a stochastic thermostat. This model
allows us to assess statistical quality of random numbers by comparing the
simulation output with the exact results that would be obtained with truly
random numbers. We also profile the performance of these generators in terms of
the computational time, memory usage, and the speedup factor (CPU/GPU time).

(Sgr) dwarf that is capable of simultaneously satisfying the majority of
angular position, distance, and radial velocity constraints imposed by current
wide-field surveys of its dynamically young (< 3 Gyr) tidal debris streams. In
particular, this model resolves the conflicting angular position and radial
velocity constraints on the Sgr leading tidal stream that have been highlighted
in recent years. While the model does not reproduce the apparent bifurcation
observed in the leading debris stream, recent observational data suggest that
this bifurcation may represent a constraint on the internal properties of the
Sgr dwarf rather than the details of its orbit. The key element in the success
of this model is the introduction of a non-axisymmetric component to the
Galactic gravitational potential which can be described in terms of a triaxial
dark matter halo whose minor/major axis ratio (c/a)_Phi = 0.72 and
intermediate/major axis ratio (b/a)_Phi = 0.99 at radii 20 < r < 60 kpc. The
minor/intermediate/major axes of this halo lie along the directions (l, b) =
(7, 0), (0, 90), and (97, 0) respectively, corresponding to a nearly-oblate
ellipsoid whose minor axis is contained within the Galactic disk plane. We
demonstrate that with simple assumptions about the star formation history of
Sgr, tidal stripping models naturally give rise to gradients in the metallicity
distribution function (MDF) along the stellar debris streams similar to those
observed in recent studies. (Abridged).

created from accretion shocks, which may act to amplify weak magnetic fields in
the protostellar cloud. Numerical simulations showed that such turbulence is
sub-sonic in the first star-forming minihalos, and highly supersonic in the
first galaxies with virial temperatures larger than 10^4 K. We investigate the
magnetic field amplification during the collapse both for Kolmogorov and
Burgers-type turbulence with a semi-analytic model that incorporates the
effects of gravitational compression and small-scale dynamo amplification. We
find that the magnetic field may be substantially amplified before the
formation of a disk. On scales of 1/10 of the Jeans length, saturation occurs
after ~10^8 yr. Although the saturation behaviour of the small-scale dynamo is
still somewhat uncertain, we expect a saturation field strength of the order
~10^{-7} n^{0.5} G in the first star-forming halos, with n the number density
in cgs units. In the first galaxies with higher turbulent velocities, the
magnetic field strength may be increased by an order of magnitude, and
saturation may occur after 10^6 to 10^7 yr. In the Kolmogorov case, the
magnetic field strength on the integral scale (i.e. the scale with most
magnetic power) is higher due to the characteristic power-law indices, but the
difference is less than a factor of 2 in the saturated phase. Our results thus
indicate that the precise scaling of the turbulent velocity with length scale
is of minor importance. They further imply that magnetic fields will be
significantly enhanced before the formation of a protostellar disk, where they
may change the fragmentation properties of the gas and the accretion rate.

interacting Fermi systems in a controlled and uncomplicated setting. The
ability to tune attractive interactions has led to the discovery of
superfluidity in these systems with an extremely high transition temperature,
near T/T_F = 0.2. This superfluidity is the electrically neutral analog of
superconductivity; however, superfluidity in atomic Fermi gases occurs in the
limit of strong interactions and defies a conventional BCS description. For
these strong interactions, it is predicted that the onset of pairing and
superfluidity can occur at different temperatures. This gives rise to a
pseudogap region where, for a range of temperatures, the system retains some of
the characteristics of the superfluid phase, such as a BCS-like dispersion and
a partially gapped density of states, but does not exhibit superfluidity. By
making two independent measurements: the direct observation of pair
condensation in momentum space and a measurement of the single-particle
spectral function using an analog to photoemission spectroscopy, we directly
probe the pseudogap phase. Our measurements reveal a BCS-like dispersion with
back-bending near the Fermi wave vector k_F that persists well above the

computing: in cloud, do many task computing (MTC) or high throughput computing
(HTC) service providers, which offer the corresponding computing service to end
users, benefit from the economies of scale? Our research contributions are
three-fold: first, we propose an innovative usage model, called dynamic service
provision (DSP) model, for MTC or HTC service providers. In the DSP model, the
resource provider provides the service of creating and managing runtime
environments for MTC or HTC service providers, and consolidates heterogeneous
MTC or HTC workloads on the cloud platform; second, according to the DSP model,
we design and implement DawningCloud, which provides automatic management for
heterogeneous workloads; third, a comprehensive evaluation of DawningCloud has
been performed in an emulatation experiment. We found that for typical
workloads, in comparison with the previous two cloud solutions, DawningCloud
saves the resource consumption maximally by 46.4% (HTC) and 74.9% (MTC) for the
service providers, and saves the total resource consumption maximally by 29.7%
for the resource provider. At the same time, comparing with the traditional
solution that provides MTC or HTC services with dedicated systems, DawningCloud
is more cost-effective. To this end, we conclude that for typical MTC and HTC
workloads, on the cloud platform, MTC and HTC service providers and the
resource provider can benefit from the economies of scale.

stellar systems under the strong finite-source effect, where the planet orbits
one of the companions. From this, we find that the pattern of central
perturbations in triple lens systems commonly appears as a combination of
individual characteristic patterns of planetary and binary lens systems in a
certain range where the sizes of the caustics induced by a planet and a binary
companion are comparable, and the range changes with the mass ratio of the
planet to the planet-hosting star. Specially, we find that because of this
central perturbation pattern, the characteristic feature of high-magnification
events caused by the triple lens systems appears in the residual from the
single-lensing light curve despite the strong finite-source effect, and it is
discriminated from those of the planetary and binary lensing events and thus
can be used for the identification of the existence of both planet and binary
companion. This characteristic feature is a simultaneous appearance of two
features. First, double negative-spike and single positive-spike features
caused by the binary companion appear together in the residual, where the
double negative spike occurs at both moments when the source enters and exits
the caustic center and the single positive spike occurs at the moment just
before the source enters into or just after the source exits from the caustic
center. Second, the magnification excess before or after the single
positive-spike feature is positive due to the planet, and the positive excess
has a remarkable increasing or decreasing pattern depending on the source
trajectory.

differences between efficient estimators of parameters taking values in a

elliptic differential forms depending on the asymptotic covariance matrix V.
Each efficient estimator has the same asymptotic risk as a 'local Bayes'

the estimators identifies the smooth prior densities as admissible or
inadmissible, according to the existence of solutions to certain elliptic

interstellar absorption line profiles of the CIV (1550 A) high ionization
doublet recorded towards the nearby B2Ve star HD 158427 (d~74pc). These data,
which were recorded with the recently re-furbished STIS instrument on the HST,
represent the most convincing detection yet of highly ionized CIV absorption
that can be associated with interstellar gas located within the boundary of the
Local Cavity. Two highly ionized gas clouds at V1 = -24.3 km/s and V2 = -41.3
km/s are revealed in both CIV absorption lines, with the V1 component almost
certainly being due to absorption by the Local Interstellar Cloud (d<5pc).
Although the observed column densities for both cloud components can be
explained by the predictions of current theoretical models of the local
interstellar medium, the narrow doppler width of the V2 line-profile (b = 6.8
km/s) indicates an unusually low gas temperature of less than 34,000K for this
highly ionized component. It is conjectured that the V2 cloud may be due to an
outflow of highly ionized and hot gas from the nearby Loop I superbubble. These
new data also indicate that absorption due to highly ionized gas in the Local
Cavity can be best described as being 'patchy' in nature.

query optimization, and data privacy, the notion of view plays a central role.
In several contexts, such as data integration, data mashups, and data
warehousing, the need arises of designing views starting from a set of known
correspondences between queries over different schemas. In this paper we deal
with the issue of automating such a design process. We call this novel problem
""view synthesis from schema mappings"": given a set of schema mappings, each
relating a query over a source schema to a query over a target schema,
automatically synthesize for each source a view over the target schema in such
a way that for each mapping, the query over the source is a rewriting of the
query over the target wrt the synthesized views. We study view synthesis from
schema mappings both in the relational setting, where queries and views are
(unions of) conjunctive queries, and in the semistructured data setting, where
queries and views are (two-way) regular path queries, as well as unions of
conjunctions thereof. We provide techniques and complexity upper bounds for
each of these cases.

detailed comparison with earlier results for Nb(110)/Au(111)/Fe(110). We use
quantitative FFT analysis to confirm the existence of a long-period (2.1 nm)
oscillation in the superconducting transition temperature Tc as a function of
the Au-layer thickness tAu, for tAu>2 nm, and highlight an additional
short-period (0.76 nm) oscillation for tAu<3 nm in Nb/Au/Co. This short-period
oscillation can be explained in terms of a damped RKKY-like oscillation of the
spin-polarization in Au. The robustness of the long-period oscillation against
the substitution of Co for Fe suggests that it is intrinsic to the Au(111)
layer on Nb, and may represent a new form of quantum interference in very clean

classical Pierce-Birkhoff conjecture which deals with polynomial rings over a
real closed field). We first recall the Connectedness and the Definable
Connectedness conjectures, both of which imply the Pierce - Birkhoff
conjecture. Then we introduce the notion of a system of approximate roots of a
valuation v on a ring A (that is, a collection Q of elements of A such that
every v-ideal is generated by products of elements of Q). We use approximate
roots to give explicit formulae for sets in the real spectrum of A which we
strongly believe to satisfy the conclusion of the Definable Connectedness
conjecture. We prove this claim in the special case of dimension 2. This proves
the Pierce-Birkhoff conjecture for arbitrary regular 2-dimensional rings.

can be attributed to an improvement of atomic data and the inclusion of NLTE
computations, but also the use of hydrodynamical model atmospheres seemed to
play a role. This ""decrease"" with time of the metallicity of the solar
photosphere increased the disagreement with the results from helioseismology.
With a CO5BOLD 3D model of the solar atmosphere, the CIFIST team at the Paris
Observatory re-determined the photospheric solar abundances of several
elements, among them C, N, and O. The spectroscopic abundances are obtained by
fitting the equivalent width and/or the profile of observed spectral lines with
synthetic spectra computed from the 3D model atmosphere. We conclude that the
effects of granular fluctuations depend on the characteristics of the
individual lines, but are found to be relevant only in a few particular cases.
3D effects are not reponsible for the systematic lowering of the solar
abundances in recent years. The solar metallicity resulting from this analysis
is Z=0.0153, Z/X=0.0209.

enigma of how such a chaotic system can ever learn or respond in a controlled

have traditionally avoided strong fluctuations. Conversely, we propose that
brain activity having features typical of systems at a critical point,
represents a crucial ingredient for learning. We present here a study which
provides novel insights toward the understanding of the problem. Our model is
able to reproduce quantitatively the experimentally observed critical state of
the brain and, at the same time, learns and remembers logical rules including
the exclusive OR (XOR), which has posed difficulties to several previous
attempts. We implement the model on a network with topological properties close
to the functionality network in real brains. Learning occurs via plastic
adaptation of synaptic strengths and exhibits universal features. We find that
the learning performance and the average time required to learn are controlled
by the strength of plastic adaptation, in a way independent of the specific
task assigned to the system. Even complex rules can be learned provided that
the plastic adaptation is sufficiently slow.

outside the habitable zone of a host star during the main sequence phase may
enter the habitable zone of the host star during other evolutionary phases. A
terrestrial planet within the habitable zone of its host star is generally
thought to be suited to life existence. Furthermore, a rocky moon around a
giant planet may be also suited to life survive, provided that the planet-moon
system is within the habitable zone of its host star. Using Eggleton's code and
the boundary flux of habitable zone, we calculate the habitable zone of our

orbit will enter the habitable zone of Solar during the subgiant branch phase

one-component Asakura-Oosawa (AO) model where the polymer's degrees of freedom
are incorporated via an attractive part in the effective potential for the

reservoir packing fraction is eta_p^r=0.1 and the colloid-polymer size ratio is
q=sigma_p/\sigma=0.15 (with sigma_p and sigma the diameter of polymers and
colloids, respectively). Inhomogeneous solid-liquid systems are prepared by
placing the solid fcc phase in the middle of a rectangular simulation box
creating two interfaces with the adjoined bulk liquid. By analyzing the growth
of the crystalline region at various pressures and for different system sizes,
the coexistence pressure p_co is obtained, yielding p_co=11.576 k_BT/sigma^3

rank entangled mixed state with positive partial transpose (a PPT state) from
an unextendible product basis (a UPB), defined as an unextendible set of
orthogonal product vectors. We point out that a state constructed in this way
belongs to a continuous family of entangled PPT states of the same rank, all
related by non-singular product transformations, unitary or non-unitary. The
characteristic property of a state $\rho$ in such a family is that its kernel
$\Ker\rho$ has a generalized UPB, a basis of product vectors, not necessarily
orthogonal, with no product vector in $\Im\rho$, the orthogonal complement of
$\Ker\rho$. The generalized UPB in $\Ker\rho$ has the special property that it
can be transformed to orthogonal form by a product transformation. In the case
of a system of dimension $3\times 3$, we give a complete parametrization of
orthogonal UPBs. This is then a parametrization of families of rank 4 entangled
(and extremal) PPT states, and we present strong numerical evidence that it is
a complete classification of such states. We speculate that the lowest rank

Many systems show
multiple such (positive or negative) feedback loops. Nevertheless, very few
quantitative analyses address the question how such multiple feedback loops
evolved. Based on published models from the mitotic cycle in embryogenesis, we
build a few case studies. Using a simple core architecture (transcription,
phosphorylation and degradation), we define oscillatory models having either
one positive feedback or one negative feedback, or both loops. With these
models, we address the following questions about evolvability: could a system
evolve from a simple model to a more complex one with a continuous transition
in the parameter space? How do new feedback loops emerge without disrupting the
proper function of the system? Our results show that progressive formation of a
second feedback loop is possible without disturbing existing oscillatory
behavior. For this process, the parameters of the system have to change during
evolution to maintain predefined properties of oscillations like period and
amplitude.

created by the small Ne nucleus passing through the heavy U nucleus is followed
by a slower and more dilute Mach shock wave which causes conical emission of

low-density regions with a small flow velocity comparable to the speed of

a set of states in which the nonlocal interaction does not affect the

Brownian ratchets to the realm of antipersistent non-Markovian subdiffusion in
viscoelastic media. A periodically forced subdiffusion in a parity-broken
ratchet potential is considered within the non-Markovian generalized Langevin
equation (GLE) description with a power-law memory kernel $\eta(t)\propto
t^{-\alpha}$ ($0<\alpha<1$). It is shown that subdiffusive rectification
currents, defined through the mean displacement and subvelocity $v_{\alpha}$,
$<\delta x(t)>\sim v_{\alpha} t^{\alpha}/ \Gamma(1+\alpha)$, emerge
asymptotically due to the breaking of the detailed balance symmetry by driving.
The asymptotic exponent is $\alpha$, the same as for free subdiffusion,
$<\delta x^2(t)>\propto t^\alpha$.
  However, a transient to this regime with some time-dependent $\alpha_{\rm
eff}(t)$ gradually decaying in time, $\alpha\leq \alpha_{\rm eff}(t)\leq 1$,
can be very slow depending on the barrier height and the driving field
strength. In striking contrast to its normal diffusion counterpart, the
anomalous rectification current is absent asymptotically in the limit of
adiabatic driving with frequency $\Omega\to 0$, displaying a resonance like
dependence on the driving frequency. However, an anomalous current inversion
occurs for a sufficiently fast driving, like in the normal diffusion case. In
the lowest order of the driving field, such a rectification current presents a
quadratic response effect. Beyond perturbation regime it exhibits a broad
maximum versus the driving field strength. Moreover, anomalous current exhibits
a maximum versus the potential amplitude.

changes numbers of impurity complexes of different types. As a result, it
effects the shape and depth of the polaron gap formed at the states belonging

reflects in a conceptual way the structure of the graph, and emphasizes the
subtle parallelism between these topological invariants and the analytic
invariants of normal surface singularities. The second formula realizes the
Seiberg-Witten invariant as the normalized Euler characteristic of the lattice
cohomology associated with the graph, supporting the conjectural connections
between the Seiberg-Witten Floer homology, or the Heegaard-Floer homology, and
the lattice cohomology.

of the solar surface remains 'quiet' at any time of the solar cycle. The quiet
sun is not void of magnetic fields, though; they are organized at smaller
spatial scales and evolve relatively fast, which makes them difficult to
detect. Thus, although extensive quiet Sun magnetism would be a natural driver
to a uniform, steady heating of the outer solar atmosphere, it is not clear
what the physical processes involved would be due to lack of observational
evidence. We report the topology and dynamics of the magnetic field in very
quiet regions of the Sun from spectropolarimetric observations of the Hinode
satellite, showing a continuous injection of magnetic flux with a well
organized topology of Omega-loop from below the solar surface into the upper
layers. At first stages, when the loop travels across the photosphere, it has a
flattened (staple-like) geometry and a mean velocity ascent of $\sim3$ km/s.
When the loop crosses the minimum temperature region, the magnetic fields at
the footpoints become almost vertical and the loop topology ressembles a
potential field. The mean ascent velocity at chromospheric height is $\sim12$
km/s. The energy input rate of these small-scale loops in the lower boundary of
the chromosphere is (at least) of 1.4x10^6-2.2x10^7 erg cm-2 s-1. Our findings
provide empirical evidence for solar magnetism as a multi-scale system, in
which small-scale low-flux magnetism plays a crucial role, at least as
important as active regions, coupling different layers of the solar atmosphere
and being an important ingredient for chromospheric and coronal heating models.

unlike in standard DE models, a substantial amount of DE exists in the
matter-dominated era, self-consistently including DE perturbations. Our
analysis shows that, marginalizing over the non DE parameters such as $Omega_m,
H_0, n_s$, current CMB observations alone can constrain the scale factor of
transition from early DE to late time DE to $a_t \geq 0.44$ and width of
transition to $Delta_t \leq 0.37$. The equation of state at present is somewhat
weakly constrained to $w_0 \leq -0.6$, if we allow $H_0 < 60$ km/s/Mpc. Taken
together with other observations, such as supernovae, HST, and SDSS LRGs, the
constraints are tighter-- $w_0 \leq -0.9, a_t \leq 0.19, \Delta_t \leq 0.21$.
The evolution of the equation of state for EDE models is thus close to
$\Lambda$CDM at low redshifts. Incorrectly assuming DE perturbations to be
negligible leads to different constraints on the equation of state parameters,
thus highlighting the necessity of self-consistently including DE perturbations
in the analysis. If we allow the spatial curvature to be a free parameter, then
the constraints are relaxed to $w_0 \leq -0.77, a_t \leq 0.35, \Delta_t \leq
0.35$ with $-0.014 < \Omega_{\kappa} < 0.031$ for CMB+other observations. For
perturbed EDE models, the $2\sigma$ lower limit on $\sigma_8$ ($\sigma_8 \geq
0.59$) is much lower than that in $\Lambda$CDM ($\sigma_8 \geq 0.72$), thus
raising the interesting possibility of discriminating EDE from $\Lambda$CDM
using future observations such as halo mass functions or the Sunyaev-Zeldovich
power spectrum.

synchrotron emission is almost certainly anisotropic, and may be strongly
anisotropic, depending on details of electron acceleration in the blast wave.
Anisotropic afterglows can display fast and strong variability at high
frequencies (above the 'fast-cooling' frequency). This may explain the

between vertices in a graph is the commute distance (resistance distance). For
two vertices u and v, the hitting time H_{uv} is the expected time it takes a
random walk to travel from u to v. The commute time is its symmetrized version
C_{uv} = H_{uv} + H_{vu}. In our paper we study the behavior of hitting times
and commute distances when the number n of vertices in the graph is very large.
We prove that as n converges to infinty, hitting times and commute distances
converge to expressions that do not take into account the global structure of
the graph at all. Namely, the hitting time H_{uv} converges to 1/d_v and the
commute time to 1/d_u + 1/d_v where d_u and d_v denote the degrees of vertices
u and v. In these cases, the hitting and commute times are misleading in the
sense that they do not provide information about the structure of the graph. We

establishing stability of these subcategories under pullback and pushforward
along open and closed immersions, a motivic t-structure is constructed.
Exactness properties of these functors familiar from perverse sheaves are shown
to hold in this context. The cohomological dimension of mixed Artin-Tate

Artin-Tate motives with the derived category of mixed Artin-Tate motives.
  Update in second version: a functorial and strict weight filtration for mixed

performed: first, the category of Artin-Tate motives is now defined to be the
triangulated category generated by direct factors of $f_* \mathbf 1(n)$---as
opposed to the thick category generated by these generators. Secondly, the
exactness of $f^*$ for a finite map is only stated for etale maps $f$.

but phenomenologically acceptable way. Given this set-up, we study how the
gauge and Yukawa couplings and the N=1 brane supersymmetry breaking soft masses
run through the energy scale exciting the Kaluza-Klein states at regular
interval. We present our results by showing the allowed/disallowed zone in the
plane of the common scalar mass ($m_0$) and common gaugino mass ($M_{1/2}$).
Our plots are the first 5d versions of the often displayed 4d $m_0$--$M_{1/2}$
plots, and we provide reasons behind the differences between the 4d and 5d
plots.

that if the distribution of contrast extends down to values close to unity
(i.e. if both highly variable and smooth outflows can exist) the luminosity
function has two branches. At high luminosity it follows the distribution of
Edot while at low luminosity it is close to a power law of slope -0.5. We then
examine if existing data can constrain the luminosity function. Using the log N
- log P curve, the Ep distribution of bright BATSE bursts and the XRF/GRB ratio
obtained by HETE2 we show that single and broken power-laws can provide equally
good fits of these data. Present observations are therefore unable to favor one
form of the other. However when a broken power-law is adopted they clearly
indicate a low luminosity slope ~ -0.6 +- 0.2, compatible with the prediction
of the internal shock model.

of nearby galaxies. After a brief summary on significant advances in
characterizing various types of discrete X-ray sources, the presentation
focuses on the global hot gas in and around galaxies, especially normal ones
like our own. The hot gas is a product of stellar and AGN feedback -- the least
understood part in theories of galaxy formation and evolution. Chandra
observations have led to the first characterization of the spatial, thermal,
chemical, and kinetic properties of the gas in our Galaxy. The gas is
concentrated around the Galactic bulge and disk on scales of a few kpc. The
column density of chemically-enriched hot gas on larger scales is at least an
order magnitude smaller, indicating that it may not account for the bulk of the
missing baryon matter predicted for the Galactic halo according to the standard
cosmology. Similar results have also been obtained for other nearby galaxies.
The X-ray emission from hot gas is well correlated with the star formation rate
and stellar mass, indicating that the heating is primarily due to the stellar
feedback. However, the observed X-ray luminosity of the gas is typically less
than a few percent of the feedback energy. Thus the bulk of the feedback
(including injected heavy elements) is likely lost in galaxy-wide outflows. The
results are compared with simulations of the feedback to infer its dynamics and
interplay with the circum-galactic medium, hence the evolution of galaxies.

Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4051 observed during a low flux state and infer the
physical properties of the emitting and absorbing gas in the soft X-ray regime.
X-ray high-resolution spectroscopy offers a powerful diagnostic tool since the
observed spectral features strongly depend on the physical properties of matter
(ionization parameter U, electron density n_e, hydrogen column density N_H),
which in turn are tightly related to the location and size of the X-ray
emitting clouds. We carried out a phenomenological study to identify the atomic
transitions detected in the spectra. This study suggests that the spectrum is
dominated by emission from a photoionised plasma. Then, we used the
photoionization code Cloudy to produce synthetic models for the emission line
component and the warm absorber observed during phases of high intrinsic
luminosity. The low state spectrum cannot be described by a single
photoionization component. A multi-ionization phase gas with ionization
parameter in the range log U = 0.63-1.90 and column density log N_H =
22.10-22.72 cm^-2 is required, while the electron density n_e remains
unconstrained. A warm absorber medium is required by the fit with parameters

an X-ray emitting regions at a distance > 5 x 10^-2 pc from the central engine.

special feature of our technique is that it produces quadratic function fields
of minimal genus for any given 3-rank. Taking advantage of certain
