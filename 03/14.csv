4-dimensional coupled-qubit model with weak but otherwise arbitrary coupling
has been given recently [M. R. Geller et al., Phys. Rev. A, 012320 (2010)]. How
does the resulting fidelity depend on the form of qubit-qubit coupling? In this
paper we calculate intrinsic fidelity curves (fidelity in the absence of
decoherence versus total gate time) for a variety of qubit-qubit interactions,
including the commonly occurring isotropic Heisenberg and XY models, as well as
randomly generated ones. For interactions not too close to that of the Ising
model, we find that the fidelity curves do not significantly depend on the form
of the interaction, and we calculate the resulting interaction-averaged
fidelity curve for the non-Ising-like cases and a criterion for determining its
applicability.

clusters and the implications for cluster magnetic fields and turbulence.
Viscous heating of a weakly collisional magnetised plasma is regulated by the
pressure anisotropy with respect to the local direction of the magnetic field.
The intracluster medium is a high-beta plasma, where pressure anisotropies
caused by the turbulent stresses and the consequent local changes in the
magnetic field will trigger very fast microscale instabilities. We argue that
the net effect of these instabilities will be to pin the pressure anisotropies
at a marginal level, controlled by the plasma beta parameter. This gives rise
to local heating rates that turn out to be comparable to the radiative cooling
rates. Furthermore, we show that a balance between this heating and
Bremsstrahlung cooling is thermally stable, unlike the often conjectured
balance between cooling and thermal conduction. Given a sufficient (and
probably self-regulating) supply of turbulent power, this provides a physical
mechanism for mitigating cooling flows and preventing cluster core collapse.
For observed density and temperature profiles, the assumed balance of viscous
heating and radiative cooling allows us to predict magnetic-field strengths,
turbulent velocities and turbulence scales as functions of distance from the
centre. Specific predictions and comparisons with observations are given for
several different clusters. Our predictions can be further tested by future
observations of cluster magnetic fields and turbulent velocities.

of fragments (or cores) in magnetically-supported, self-gravitating molecular
clouds in axisymmetric geometry, accounting for the effects of ambipolar
diffusion and Ohmic dissipation, grain chemistry and dynamics, and radiative
transfer. Here we present results of star formation simulations that accurately
track the evolution of a protostellar fragment over eleven orders of magnitude
in density (from 300 cm^-3 to \approx 10^14 cm^-3), i.e., from the early
ambipolar-diffusion--initiated fragmentation phase, through the magnetically
supercritical, dynamical-contraction phase and the subsequent magnetic
decoupling stage, to the formation of a protostellar core in near hydrostatic
equilibrium. As found by Fiedler & Mouschovias (1993), gravitationally-driven
ambipolar diffusion leads to the formation and subsequent dynamic contraction
of a magnetically supercritical core. Moreover, we find that ambipolar
diffusion, not Ohmic dissipation, is responsible for decoupling all the species
except the electrons from the magnetic field, by a density \approx 3 x 10^12
cm^-3. Magnetic decoupling precedes the formation of a central stellar object
and ultimately gives rise to a concentration of magnetic flux (a `magnetic
wall') outside the hydrostatic core --- as also found by Tassis & Mouschovias
(2005a,b) through a different approach. At approximately the same density at
which Ohmic dissipation becomes more important than ambipolar diffusion
(\gtrsim 7 x 10^12 cm^-3), the grains carry most of the electric charge as well
as the electric current. The prestellar core remains disclike down to radii ~
10 AU, inside which thermal pressure becomes important. The magnetic flux
problem of star formation is resolved for at least strongly magnetic newborn
stars by this stage of the evolution, i.e., by a central density \approx 10^14
cm^-3. The hydrostatic core has radius \approx 2 AU, density \approx 10^14
cm^-3, temperature \approx 300 K, magnetic field strength \approx 0.2 G,

length is exponentially small, with a decay length much shorter than the tube
radius R. Then we discuss the effect of azimuthal roughness of the tube on the
plug speed. The tube roughness leads to an unbalanced capillary pressure and a
carrier fluid flux in the azimuthal plane. This flux controls the relaxation of
the plug shape to its infinite-length limit. For long-wavelength roughness, we
find that the above decay length is much longer in the rough tube, and even
becomes comparable to the tube radius R in some cases. This implies a
much-enhanced dependence of the plug speed on the plug length. This mechanism

Achieving QND measurements of photons is especially challenging because the
detector must be completely transparent to the photons while still acquiring
information about them. Recent progress in manipulating microwave photons in
superconducting circuits has increased demand for a QND detector which operates
in the gigahertz frequency range. Here we demonstrate a QND detection scheme
which measures the number of photons inside a high quality-factor microwave
cavity on a chip. This scheme maps a photon number onto a qubit state in a
single-shot via qubit-photon logic gates. We verify the operation of the device
by analyzing the average correlations of repeated measurements, and show that
it is 90% QND. It differs from previously reported detectors because its
sensitivity is strongly selective to chosen photon number states. This scheme
could be used to monitor the state of a photon-based memory in a quantum

where the longitudinal resistance Rxx > R_K/2. The critical resistivity (Rxx
per square) is rho_xx(nu_c) ~ R_K/2 and is correlated with the appearance of
zero plateau in Hall conductivity sigma_xy(nu) and peaks in sigma_xx(nu). This
leads us to construct a universal low-T (n, B) phase diagram of this quantum
phase transition.

single-molecule magnet Mn$_{12}$, bridged between Au(111) electrodes, using the
non-equilibrium Green's function method and the density-functional theory. We
analyze the effects of bonding type, molecular orientation, and geometry
relaxation on the electronic properties and charge and spin transport across
the single-molecule junction. We consider nine interface geometries leading to
five bonding mechanisms and two molecular orientations: (i) Au-C bonding, (ii)
Au-Au bonding, (iii) Au-S bonding, (iv) Au-H bonding, and (v) physisorption via
van der Waals forces. The two molecular orientations of Mn$_{12}$ correspond to
the magnetic easy axis of the molecule aligned perpendicular [hereafter denoted
as orientation (1)] or parallel [orientation (2)] to the direction of electron
transport. We find that the electron transport is carried by the lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level in all the cases that we have
simulated. Relaxation of the junction geometries mainly shifts the relevant
occupied molecular levels toward the Fermi energy as well as slightly reduces
the broadening of the LUMO level. As a result, the current slightly decreases
at low bias voltage. Our calculations also show that placing the molecule in
the orientation (1) broadens the LUMO level much more than in the orientation
(2), due to the internal structure of the Mn$_{12}$. Consequently, junctions
with the former orientation yield a higher current than those with the latter.
Among all of the bonding types considered, the Au-C bonding gives rise to the
highest current (about one order of magnitude higher than the Au-S bonding),
for a given distance between the electrodes. The current through the junction
with other bonding types decreases in the order of Au-Au, Au-S, and Au-H.
Importantly, the spin-filtering effect in all the nine geometries stays robust
and their ratios of the majority-spin to the minority-spin transmission
coefficients are in the range of 10$^3$ to 10$^8$. The general trend in
transport among the different bonding types and molecular orientations obtained
from this study may be applied to other single-molecular magnets.

clustering properties of these stellar mass selected samples as a function of
redshift and stellar mass, and discuss the implications of measured clustering
strengths in terms of their likely halo masses. We find that galaxies with high
stellar masses have a progressively higher clustering strength, and amplitude,
than galaxies with lower stellar masses. We also find that galaxies within a
fixed stellar mass range have a higher clustering strength at higher redshifts.
We furthermore use our measured clustering strengths, combined with models from
Mo & White (2002), to determine the average total masses of the dark matter
haloes hosting these galaxies. We conclude that for all galaxies in our sample
the stellar-mass-to-total-mass ratio is always lower than the universal
baryonic mass fraction. Using our results, and a compilation from the
literature, we furthermore show that there is a strong correlation between
stellar-mass-to-total-mass ratio and derived halo masses for central galaxies,
such that more massive haloes contain a lower fraction of their mass in the
form of stars over our entire redshift range. For central galaxies in haloes
with masses M(halo)>10^13M(sun) we find that this ratio is <0.02, much lower
than the universal baryonic mass fraction. We show that the remaining baryonic
mass is included partially in stars within satellite galaxies in these haloes,
and as diffuse hot and warm gas. We also find that, at a fixed stellar mass,
the stellar-to-total-mass ratio increases at lower redshifts. This suggests
that galaxies at a fixed stellar mass form later in lower mass dark matter
haloes, and earlier in massive haloes. We interpret this as a ""halo downsizing""
effect, however some of this evolution could be attributed to halo assembly
bias.

log-concavity of the generalized Marcum and Nuttall Q-functions. More
precisely, a simple probabilistic method is firstly given to prove the
monotonicity of these two functions. Then, the log-concavity of the generalized
Marcum Q-function and its deformations is established with respect to each of
the three parameters. Since the Nuttall Q-function has similar probabilistic
interpretations as the generalized Marcum Q-function, we deduce the
log-concavity of the Nuttall Q-function. By exploiting the log-concavity of
these two functions, we propose new tight lower and upper bounds for the
generalized Marcum and Nuttall Q-functions. Our proposed bounds are much
tighter than the existing bounds in the literature in most of the cases. The
relative errors of our proposed bounds converge to 0 as b tends to infinity.
The numerical results show that the absolute relative errors of the proposed
bounds are less than 5% in most of the cases. The proposed bounds can be
effectively applied to the outage probability analysis of interference-limited
systems such as cognitive radio and wireless sensor network, in the study of
error performance of various wireless communication systems operating over
fading channels and extracting the log-likelihood ratio for differential
phase-shift keying (DPSK) signals.

in the presence of intrinsic decoherence is studied. The usefulness of such
system for performance of the quantum teleportation protocol ${\cal T}_0$ and
entanglement teleportation protocol ${\cal T}_1$ is also investigated. The
results depend on the initial conditions and the parameters of the system. For
the product and maximally entangled initial states, increasing the size of
spin-orbit interaction parameter $D$ amplifies the effects of dephasing and
hence decreases the asymptotic entanglement and fidelity of teleportation. We
show that the XY and XYZ Heisenberg systems provide a minimal resource
entanglement, required for realizing efficient teleportation. Also, we find
that for the some special cases there are some maximally entangled states which
are immune to intrinsic decoherence. Therefore, it is possible to perform the
quantum teleportation protocol ${\cal T}_0$ and the entanglement teleportation
${\cal T}_1$ with perfect quality by choosing a proper set of parameters and
employing one of these maximally entangled robust states as initial state of
the resource.

apsidal precession with a period as short as a few decades. This precession
would be measurable if the orbit had a significant eccentricity, leading to an
estimate of the tidal Love number and an assessment of the degree of central
concentration in the planetary interior. An initial ground-based secondary
eclipse phase reported by Lopez-Morales et al. (0.510 +/- 0.002) implied
eccentricity at the 4.5 sigma level. The spectroscopic orbit of Hebb et al. has
eccentricity 0.049 +/- 0.015, a 3 sigma result, implying an eclipse phase of
0.509 +/- 0.007. However, there is a well documented tendency of spectroscopic
data to overestimate small eccentricities. Our eclipse phases are 0.5010 +/-
0.0006 (3.6 and 5.8 microns) and 0.5006 +/- 0.0007 (4.5 and 8.0 microns). An
unlikely orbital precession scenario invoking an alignment of the orbit during
the Spitzer observations could have explained this apparent discrepancy, but
the final eclipse phase of Lopez-Morales et al. (0.510 -0.006 / +0.007) is
consistent with a circular orbit at better than 2 sigma. An orbit fit to all
the available transit, eclipse, and radial-velocity data indicates precession
at <1 sigma; a non-precessing solution fits better. We also comment on analysis

all Hamiltonians in quantum mechanics. In this Letter, we use a recently
proposed GUP which is consistent with String Theory, Doubly Special Relativity

in any quantum mechanical Hamiltonian, proportional to $\alpha p^3$ and

proportional to their square values. We show that this result is exact for the

  Antenna Systems","21 pages, 3 figures, one column format",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For an $n_t$ transmit, $n_r$ receive antenna system ($n_t \times n_r$
system), a {\it{full-rate}} space time block code (STBC) transmits $n_{min} =
min(n_t,n_r)$ complex symbols per channel use and in general, has an
ML-decoding complexity of the order of $M^{n_tn_{min}}$ (considering square
designs), where $M$ is the constellation size. In this paper, a scheme to
obtain a full-rate STBC for $2^a$ transmit antennas and any $n_r$, with reduced
ML-decoding complexity of the order of $M^{n_t(n_{min}-3/4)}$, is presented.
The weight matrices of the proposed STBC are obtained from the unitary matrix
representations of a Clifford Algebra. For any value of $n_r$, the proposed
design offers a reduction from the full ML-decoding complexity by a factor of
$M^{3n_t/4}}$. The well known Silver code for 2 transmit antennas is a special
case of the proposed scheme. Further, it is shown that the codes constructed
using the scheme have higher ergodic capacity than the well known punctured
Perfect codes for $n_r < n_t$. Simulation results of the symbol error rates are
shown for $8 \times 2$ systems, where the comparison of the proposed code is
with the punctured Perfect code for 8 transmit antennas. The proposed code
matches the punctured perfect code in error performance, while having reduced
ML-decoding complexity and higher ergodic capacity.

of normal (N) mesoscopic conductors coupled to superconducting (S) loops
(Andreev interferometers). At low RF amplitudes we observe the usual h/2e
superconducting-phase-periodic resistance oscillations as a function of applied
magnetic flux. We find that the oscillations acquire a pi-shift with increasing
RF amplitude, and consistent with this result the resistance at fixed phase is
an oscillating function of the RF amplitude. The results are explained
qualitatively as a consequence of two processes. The first is the modulation of
the phase difference between the N/S interfaces by the RF field, with the
resistance adiabatically following the phase. The second process is the change
in the electron temperature caused by the RF field. From the data the response
time of the Andreev interferometer is estimated to be <40ps. However there are
a number of experimental features which remain unexplained; these include the
drastic difference in the behaviour of the resistance at different phases as a
function of RF frequency and amplitude, and the existence of a ""window of
transparency"" where heating effects are weak enough to allow for the pi-shift.
A microscopic theory describing the influence of RF radiation on Andreev
interferometers is required.

parameter. Specializing to the case of a mean magnetic field that is slowly
varying in time, explicit expressions for the transport coefficients,
$\alpha_{il}$ and $\eta_{iml}$, are derived. We prove that, when the velocity
field is non helical, the transport coefficient $\alpha_{il}$ vanishes. We then
consider forced, stochastic dynamics for the incompressible velocity field at
low Reynolds number. An exact, explicit solution for the velocity field is
derived, and the velocity spectrum tensor is calculated in terms of the
Galilean--invariant forcing statistics. We consider forcing statistics that is
non helical, isotropic and delta-correlated-in-time, and specialize to the case
when the mean-field is a function only of the spatial coordinate $X_3$ and time
$\tau\,$; this reduction is necessary for comparison with the numerical
experiments of Brandenburg, R{\""a}dler, Rheinhardt & K\""apyl\""a (ApJ, 676, 740,

diffusivity tensor, $\eta_{ij}(\tau)\,$. These are used to prove that the

models, for which a mathematically well-developed model theory is available.
However, such models are inadequate to capture dynamic phenomena. Therefore,
epistemic plausibility models have been introduced. Because these are much
richer structures than Kripke models, they do not straightforwardly inherit the
model-theoretical results of modal logic. Therefore, while epistemic
plausibility structures are well-suited for modeling purposes, an extensive
investigation of their model theory has been lacking so far. The aim of the
present paper is to fill exactly this gap, by initiating a systematic
exploration of the model theory of epistemic plausibility models. Like in
'ordinary' modal logic, the focus will be on the notion of bisimulation. We
define various notions of bisimulations (parametrized by a language L) and show
that L-bisimilarity implies L-equivalence. We prove a Hennesy-Milner type
result, and also two undefinability results. However, our main point is a
negative one, viz. that bisimulations cannot straightforwardly be generalized
to epistemic plausibility models if conditional belief is taken into account.
We present two ways of coping with this issue: (i) adding a modality to the
language, and (ii) putting extra constraints on the models. Finally, we make
some remarks about the interaction between bisimulation and dynamic model
changes.

response to a strong sustained input stimulus, often supported by protein
activity-dependent inactivation. Adaptive response is thought to be related to
various cellular functions such as homeostasis and enlargement of dynamic range
by background compensation. Here we study the quantitative relation between
adaptive response and background compensation within a modeling framework. We
show that any particular type of adaptive response is neither sufficient nor
necessary for adaptive enlargement of dynamic range. In particular a precise
adaptive response, where system activity is maintained at a constant level at
steady state, does not ensure a large dynamic range neither in input signal nor
in system output. A general mechanism for input dynamic range enlargement can
come about from the activity-dependent modulation of protein responsiveness by
multiple biochemical modification, regardless of the type of adaptive response
it induces. Therefore hierarchical biochemical processes such as methylation
and phosphorylation are natural candidates to induce this property in signaling
systems.
