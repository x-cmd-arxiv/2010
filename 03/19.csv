Roughly, this property says that the subtrees above some given height are

sequences of distributions on partitions of the integers that determine how the
size of a tree is distributed in its different subtrees. Under some natural

that the scaling limit of random uniform unordered trees is the Brownian
continuum random tree. This extends a result by Marckert-Miermont and fully

The bipolar spatial distribution of the broader component is roughly coincident

can be explained in terms of expansion at very high (projected) velocities of
up to 300 km/s. The observations also reveal the existence of a strip of
neutral gas, parallel to the major kinematic axis, that is nearly coincident
with a region of very high [SII]/H$\alpha$ ratio tracing the shocked gas. Our
observations are consistent with the jet model presented by \cite{wilsonetal01}

The presence of a non-linear diffusion predicts the existence of fronts as well
as shock fronts. Despite the absence of memory effects, solutions in the case
of pure non-linear diffusion exhibit an anomalous sub-diffusive scaling. Due to
a balance between non-linear diffusion and convection we, in particular, show
that solitary waves appear. For large times they merge into a single solitary
wave exhibiting a topological stability. Even though our results concern a

primary at IR and the secondary at sub-mm wavelengths. The lag between the
optical and sub-mm outbursts may indicate that these two peaks arise from two
distinct regions along the jet separated by a distance of 0.07-5 pc. The flux
at 5-35 microns varied by a factor of 40 and the IR peak varied in frequency
from <1E13 Hz to 4E13 Hz between the highest and lowest states in 2005 and
2006, respectively. Variability was well correlated across the mid-IR band,
with no measurable lag. Flares that doubled in flux occurred on a time scale of
3 days. The IR SED peak moved to higher frequency as a flare brightened, then
returned to lower frequency as it decayed. The fractional variability amplitude
increased with frequency, which we attribute to decreasing synchrotron-self
absorption optical depth. Mid-IR flares may signal the re-energization of a
shock that runs into inhomogeneities along the pre-existing jet or in the
external medium. The synchrotron peak frequencies during each major outburst
may depend upon both the distance from the jet apex and the physical conditions
in the shocks. Variation of the Doppler parameter along a curved or helical jet
is another possibility. Frequency variability of the IR synchrotron peak may
have important consequences for the interpretation of the blazar sequence, and
the presence of a secondary peak may give insight into jet structure.

branch phase leads to dynamic convection in their helium cores. One-dimensional
(1D) stellar modeling of this intrinsically multi-dimensional dynamic event is
likely to be inadequate. Previous hydrodynamic simulations imply that the
single convection zone in the helium core of metal-rich Pop I stars grows
during the flash on a dynamic timescale. This may lead to hydrogen injection
into the core, and a double convection zone structure as known from
one-dimensional core helium flash simulations of low-mass Pop III stars. We
perform hydrodynamic simulations of the core helium flash in two and three
dimensions to better constrain the nature of these events. To this end we study
the hydrodynamics of convection within the helium cores of a 1.25 \Msun
metal-rich Pop I star (Z=0.02), and a 0.85 \Msun metal-free Pop III star (Z=0)
near the peak of the flash. These models possess single and double convection
zones, respectively. We use 1D stellar models of the core helium flash computed
with state-of-the-art stellar evolution codes as initial models for our
multidimensional hydrodynamic study, and simulate the evolution of these models
with the Riemann solver based hydrodynamics code Herakles which integrates the
Euler equations coupled with source terms corresponding to gravity and nuclear
burning. The hydrodynamic simulation of the Pop I model involving a single
convection zone covers 27 hours of stellar evolution, while the first
hydrodynamic simulations of a double convection zone, in the Pop III model,
span 1.8 hours of stellar life. We find differences between the predictions of
mixing length theory and our hydrodynamic simulations. The simulation of the
single convection zone in the Pop I model shows a strong growth of the size of
the convection zone due to turbulent entrainment. Hence we predict that for the
Pop I model a hydrogen injection phase (i.e. hydrogen injection into the helium
core) will commence after about 23 days, which should eventually lead to a
double convection zone structure known from 1D stellar modeling of low-mass Pop
III stars. Our two and three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of the double
(Pop III) convection zone model show that the velocity field in the convection
zones is different from that predicted by stellar evolutionary calculations.
The simulations suggest that the double convection zone decays quickly, the
flow eventually being dominated by internal gravity waves.

the main problem with inductive generalization is that not all such states can
be inductively generalized at a given time in the analysis, resulting in long

idea of inductively generalizing states relative to $k$-step

  Symposium on Space Terahertz Technology",,,,"astro-ph.IM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  SNS is a MATLAB-based software library written to aid in the design and
analysis of receiver architectures. It uses electrical scattering matrices and
noise wave vectors to describe receiver architectures of arbitrary topology and
complexity. It differs from existing freely-available software mainly in that
the scattering matrices used to describe the receiver and its components are
analytic rather than numeric. This allows different types of modeling and
analysis of receivers to be performed. Non-ideal behavior of receiver
components can be parameterized in their scattering matrices. SNS enables the
instrument designer to then derive analytic expressions for the signal and
noise at the receiver outputs in terms of parameterized component
imperfections, and predict their contribution to receiver systematic errors
precisely. This can drive the receiver design process by, for instance,
allowing the instrument designer to identify which component imperfections
contribute most to receiver systematic errors, and hence place firm
specifications on individual components. Using SNS to perform this analysis is
preferable to traditional Jones matrix-based analysis as it includes internal
reflections and is able to model noise: two effects which Jones matrix analysis
is unable to describe. SNS can be used to model any receiver in which the
components can be described by scattering matrices. Of particular interest to
the sub-mm and terahertz frequency regime is the choice between coherent and
direct detection technologies. Steady improvements in mm and sub-mm Low Noise
Amplifiers (LNAs) mean that coherent receivers with LNAs as their first active
element are becoming increasingly competitive, in terms of sensitivity, with
bolometer-based receivers at frequencies above ~100 GHz. As an example of the
utility of SNS, we use it to compare two polarimeter architectures commonly
used to perform measurements of the polarized Cosmic Microwave Background:
differencing polarimeters, an architecture commonly used in polarization
sensitive bolometer-based polarimeters; and pseudo-correlation polarimeters, an
architecture commonly used in coherent, LNA-based, polarimeters. We
parameterize common sources of receiver systematic errors in both architectures
and compare them through their Mueller matrices, which encode how well the
instruments measure the Stokes parameters of the incident radiation. These
analytic Mueller matrices are used to demonstrate the different sources of
systematic errors in differencing and correlation polarimeters.

follows the single-particle dynamics and exhibits Anderson localization, the
two-particle correlation develops unique features that depend on the quantum
statistics of the particles and their initial separation. On short time scales,
the localization of one particle becomes dependent on whether the other
particle is localized or not. On long time scales, the localized particles show
oscillatory correlations within the localization length. These effects can be
observed in Anderson localization of non-classical light and ultra-cold atoms.

reddening and the distance modulus of M54, E(B-V)=0.16 +/- 0.02 and
(m-M)_0=17.13 +/- 0.11, respectively, in excellent agreement with the most
recent estimates. The metallicity has been estimated for a subset of 47 RR
Lyrae stars, with especially good quality light curves, from the Fourier
parameters of the V light curve. The derived metallicity distribution has a
symmetric bell shape, with a mean of <[Fe/H]>=-1.65 and a standard deviation
sigma=0.16 dex. Seven stars have been identified as likely belonging to the

of WIMPs results in exponentially falling recoil spectra. In contrast, theories
of WIMPs with excited states can lead to nuclear recoil spectra that peak at
finite recoil energies E_R. The peaks of such signals are typically fairly
broad, with Delta E_R/E_peak ~ 1. We show that in the presence of dark matter
structures with low velocity dispersion, such as streams or clumps, peaks from
up-scattering can become extremely narrow with FWHM of a few keV only. This
differs dramatically from the conventionally expected WIMP spectrum and would,
once detected, open the possibility to measure the dark matter velocity
structure with a fantastic accuracy. As an intriguing example, we confront the
observed cluster of 3 events near 42 keV from the CRESST commissioning run with
this scenario, and find a wide range of parameters capable for producing such a
peak. We compare the possible signals at other experiments, and find that such
a particle could also give rise to the signal at DAMA, although not from the
same stream. Over some range of parameters a signal would be visible at xenon
experiments. We show that such dark matter peaks are a very clear signal, and
can be easily disentangled from potential backgrounds, both terrestrial or due
to WIMP down-scattering, by an enhanced annual modulation signature in both the
amplitude of the signal and its shape.

However, from an experimental point of view, realizations by pure cascading,
without a direct interaction Hamiltonian, would be much simpler to implement
and this raises the natural question of what class of linear quantum stochastic
systems are realizable by cascading alone. This paper gives a precise
characterization of this class of linear quantum stochastic systems and then it
is proved that, in the weaker sense of transfer function realizability, all
passive linear quantum stochastic systems belong to this class. A constructive
example is given to show the transfer function realization of a two degrees of

obtained eight new galaxy redshifts, adding to the four previously known, and
galaxy star formation rates and metallicities were computed where possible. A
strong MgII system [W_r(2796)=1.8A], which is a known DLA, had three previously
identified galaxies; we found two additional galaxies associated with this
system. These five galaxies form a group with diverse properties, such as a
luminosity range of 0.04<L_B<0.63L_B*, an impact parameter range of 17<D<241kpc
and velocity dispersion of 115km/s. The DLA group galaxy redshifts span beyond
the 350km/s velocity spread of the metallic absorption lines of the DLA itself.
The two brightest group galaxies have SFRs of a few Msun/yr and should not have
strong winds. We have sufficient spectroscopic information to directly compare
three of the five group galaxies' (emission-line) metallicities with the DLA
(absorption) metallicity: the DLA metallicity is 1/10th solar, substantially
lower than the three galaxies' which range between less than 1/2 solar to solar
metallicity. HST/WFPC-2 imaging shows perturbed morphologies for the three
brightest group galaxies, with tidal tails extending 25kpc. We favor a scenario
where the DLA absorption originates from tidal debris in the group environment.
Another absorber exhibits weak MgII absorption [W_r(2796)=0.03A] and had a
previously identified galaxy at a similar redshift. We have identified a second
galaxy associated with this system. Both galaxies have solar metallicities and
unperturbed morphologies. The SFR of one galaxy is much lower than expected for
strong outflows. Finally, we have identified five galaxies at large impact
parameters with no associated MgII absorption.

  6, No 3, pp. 463-485, 2008.",,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, a few novel data hiding techniques are proposed. These
techniques are improvements over the classical LSB data hiding technique and
the Fibonacci LSB data-hiding technique proposed by Battisti et al. \cite{r1}.
The classical LSB technique is the simplest, but using this technique it is
possible to embed only in first few bit-planes, since image quality becomes
drastically distorted when embedding in higher bit-planes. Battisti et al.
\cite{r1} proposed an improvement over this by using Fibonacci decomposition
technique and generating a different set of virtual bit-planes all together,
thereby increasing the number of bit-planes. In this paper, first we
mathematically model and generalize this particular approach of virtual
bit-plane generation. Then we propose two novel embedding techniques, both of
which are special-cases of our generalized model. The first embedding scheme is
based on decomposition of a number (pixel-value) in sum of prime numbers, while
the second one is based on decomposition in sum of natural numbers. Each of
these particular representations generates a different set of (virtual)
bit-planes altogether, suitable for embedding purposes. They not only allow one
to embed secret message in higher bit-planes but also do it without much
distortion, with a much better stego-image quality, in a reliable and secured
manner, guaranteeing efficient retrieval of secret message. A comparative
performance study between the classical Least Significant Bit (LSB) method, the
data hiding technique using Fibonacci -p-Sequence decomposition and our
proposed schemes has been done. Theoretical analysis indicates that image
quality of the stego-image hidden by the technique using Fibonacci
decomposition improves against simple LSB substitution method, while the same
using the prime decomposition method improves drastically against that using
Fibonacci decomposition technique, and finally the natural number decomposition
method is a further improvement against that using prime decomposition
technique. Also, optimality for the last technique is proved. For both of our
data-hiding techniques, the experimental results show that, the stego-image is
visually indistinguishable from the original cover image.

surprisingly high rates. Prominent examples are dust-obscured galaxies which
are luminous when observed at sub-millimeter (sub-mm) wavelengths and which may
be forming stars at rates upto 1,000Mo/yr. These intense bursts of star
formation are believed to be driven by mergers between gas rich galaxies.
However, probing the properties of individual star-forming regions within these
galaxies is beyond the spatial resolution and sensitivity of even the largest
telescopes at present. Here, we report observations of the sub-mm galaxy
SMMJ2135-0102 at redshift z=2.3259 which has been gravitationally magnified by
a factor of 32 by a massive foreground galaxy cluster lens. This cosmic
magnification, when combined with high-resolution sub-mm imaging, resolves the
star-forming regions at a linear scale of just ~100 parsecs. We find that the
luminosity densities of these star-forming regions are comparable to the dense
cores of giant molecular clouds in the local Universe, but they are ~100x
larger and 10^7 times more luminous. Although vigorously star-forming, the
underlying physics of the star formation processes at z~2 appears to be similar
to that seen in local galaxies even though the energetics are unlike anything
found in the present-day Universe.

examples of the evolutions of the soft supersymmetry-breaking parameters, we
discuss the effects on physical sparticle masses in some specific examples. We
note, for example, that near-degeneracy between the lightest neutralino and the
lighter stau is progressively disfavoured as $M_{in}$ increases. This has the
consequence, as we show in $(m_{1/2}, m_0)$ planes for several different values
of $\tan \beta$, that the stau coannihilation region shrinks as $M_{in}$
increases, and we delineate the regions of the $(M_{in}, \tan \beta)$ plane
where it is absent altogether. Moreover, as $M_{in}$ increases, the focus-point
region recedes to larger values of $m_0$ for any fixed $\tan \beta$ and
$m_{1/2}$. We conclude that the regions of the $(m_{1/2}, m_0)$ plane that are

The young active star BD +20 1790 is believed to host a substellar
companion, revealed by radial-velocity measurements that detected the reflex
motion induced on the parent star.
  Aims. A complete characterisation of the radial-velocity signal is necessary
in order to assess its nature.
  Methods. We used CORALIE spectrograph to obtain precise (~10 m/s) velocity
measurements on this active star, while characterizing the bisector span
variations. Particular attention was given to correctly sample both the
proposed planetary orbital period, of 7.8 days, and the stellar rotation
period, of 2.4 days.
  Results. A smaller radial-velocity signal (with peak-to-peak variations <500
m/s) than had been reported previously was detected, with different amplitude
on two different campaigns. A periodicity similar to the rotational period is
found on the data, as well as a clear correlation between radial-velocities and
bisector span. This evidence points towards a stellar origin of the
radial-velocity variations of the star instead of a barycentric movement of the
star, and repudiates the reported detection of a hot-Jupiter.

variety of brain spatiotemporal activity patterns. An important problem in
neuroscience is to understand the mechanism by which the human brain's 100
billion neurons and 100 trillion synapses manage to produce this large
repertoire of cortical configurations in a flexible manner. In addition, it is
recognized that temporal correlations across such configurations cannot be
arbitrary, but they need to meet two conflicting demands: while diverse
cortical areas should remain functionally segregated from each other, they must
still perform as a collective, i.e., they are functionally integrated. Here, we
investigate these large-scale dynamical properties by inspecting the character
of the spatiotemporal correlations of brain resting-state activity. In physical
systems, these correlations in space and time are captured by measuring the
correlation coefficient between a signal recorded at two different points in
space at two different times. We show that this two-point correlation function
extracted from resting-state fMRI data exhibits self-similarity in space and
time. In space, self-similarity is revealed by considering three successive
spatial coarse-graining steps while in time it is revealed by the 1/f frequency
behavior of the power spectrum. The uncovered dynamical self-similarity implies
that the brain is spontaneously at a continuously changing (in space and time)
intermediate state between two extremes, one of excessive cortical integration
and the other of complete segregation. This dynamical property may be seen as
an important marker of brain well-being both in health and disease.

real complex networks such as power-law degree distribution, small-worldness,

Kramers-Kronig (KK) relations during laser operation. A laser gain medium at
steady state becomes saturated and the lasing field experiences a flat gain
equal to the cavity loss. A solution of the laser equations reveals that the
lasing frequency experiences a dispersion that is linear over the allowed
bandwidth. However, outside this band, the lasing stops, so that the dispersion
is that of the unsaturated gain medium. The combined profile is therefore
non-analytical, and cannot be explained in terms of the KK relations. In order
to interpret this situation, it is important to consider carefully the physical
basis of the KK relations and its connection to causality. We conclude that the
KK relation is expected to apply only to an independent probe applied to the
medium, which is under excitation by the pump producing the gain as well as the
lasing mode. The absorption/gain and dispersion profiles are then analytical,
and satisfy the KK-relations. Specifically, these are variants of the so-called
Mollow-Ezekiel spectra of probe absorption/gain and dispersion in the presence
of a pump, with the exception that in this case the medium is inverted.

accretion disk, $R_{tr}$. We determined R_{tr}=300 r_g for observed QPO at 2
Hz. This value is much above the few $r_g$, where the Bardeen-Petterson effect
should align the midplane of the disk. For this truncated radius of the
accretion disk P_{Lense-Thirring} for a slow rotator results in a few days.

improve the quality of the decomposition compared to the Fourier transforms
which are done in the mean field reference frame. For each resulting component
we calculate spectra and two-point statistics such as longitudinal and
transverse structure functions, as well as, higher order intermittency
statistics. In addition, we perform the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition of the
velocity field into the incompressible and compressible parts and analyze these
components. We find that the turbulence intermittency is different for
different components and we show that the intermittency statistics depend on
whether the phenomenon was studied in the global reference frame related to the
mean magnetic field or it was studied in the frame defined by the local
magnetic field. The dependencies of the measures we obtained are different for
different components of velocity, for instance, we show that while the Alfven
mode intermittency changes marginally with the Mach number the intermittency of
the fast mode is substantially affected by the change.

a ""Dark GRB"". Near-infrared observations with Subaru/MOIRCS provided a clear
detection of afterglow in Ks band, although no optical counterpart was
reported. The flux ratio of rest-wavelength optical to X-ray bands of the
afterglow indicates that the dust extinction along the line of sight to the
afterglow is Av = 2.7 - 10 mag. This large extinction is probably the major
reason for optical faintness of GRB 080325. The J - Ks color of the host
galaxy, (J - Ks = 1.3 in AB magnitude), is significantly redder than those for
typical GRB hosts previously identified. In addition to J and Ks bands, optical
images in B, Rc, i', and z' bands with Subaru/Suprime-Cam were obtained at
about one year after the burst, and a photometric redshift of the host is
estimated to be z_{photo} = 1.9. The host luminosity is comparable to L^{*} at
z \sim 2 in contrast to the sub-L^{*} property of typical GRB hosts at lower
redshifts. The best-fit stellar population synthesis model for the host shows
that a large dust extinction (Av = 0.8 mag) attributes to the red nature of the
host and that the host galaxy is massive (M_{*} = 7.0 \times 10^{10} Msun)
which is one of the most massive GRB hosts previously identified. By assuming
that the mass-metallicity relation for star-forming galaxies at z \sim 2 is
applicable for the GRB host, this large stellar mass suggests the high
metallicity environment around GRB 080325, consistent with inferred large
extinction.

the SZ angular power spectrum and the central temperature decrement. The effect
of magnetic fields is included in the hydrostatic equilibrium equation by
splitting the Lorentz force into two terms one being the force due to magnetic
pressure which acts outwards and the other being magnetic tension which acts
inwards. A perturbative approach is adopted to solve for the gas density
profile for weak magnetic fields (< 4 micro G}). This leads to an enhancement
of the gas density in the central regions for nearly radial magnetic field
configurations. Previous works had considered the force due to magnetic
pressure alone which is the case only for a special set of field
configurations. However, we see that there exists possible sets of
configurations of ICM magnetic fields where the force due to magnetic tension
will dominate. Subsequently, this effect is extrapolated for typical field
strengths (~ 10 micro G) and scaling arguments are used to estimate the angular
power due to secondary anisotropies at cluster scales. In particular we find
that it is possible to explain the excess power reported by CMB experiments
like CBI, BIMA, ACBAR at l > 2000 with sigma_8 ~ 0.8 (WMAP 5 year data) for
typical cluster magnetic fields. In addition we also see that the magnetic
field effect on the SZ temperature decrement is more pronounced for low mass
clusters (<T> ~ 2 keV). Future SZ detections of low mass clusters at few arc
second resolution will be able to probe this effect more precisely. Thus, it
will be instructive to explore the implications of this model in greater detail
in future works.

construction of projections in noncommutative tori, (b) the construction of
tight Gabor frames. The present investigation relies an interpretation of
projective modules over noncommutative tori in terms of Gabor analysis. The
main result demonstrates that Rieffel's condition on the existence of
projections in noncommutative tori is equivalent to the Wexler-Raz
biorthogonality relations for tight Gabor frames. Therefore we are able to
invoke results on the existence of Gabor frames in the construction of
projections in noncommutative tori. In particular, the projection associated
with a Gabor frame generated by a Gaussian turns out to be Boca's projection.
Our approach to Boca's projection allows us to characterize the range of
existence of Boca's projection. The presentation of our main result provides a
natural approach to the Wexler-Raz biorthogonality relations in terms of

$\tilde{h}$ such that the plus measure with parameters $J_2$ and $h$ dominates

ordered in the interaction parameter for a fixed external field. Next, we
consider the fuzzy Potts model and prove that on $\Zd$ the fuzzy Potts measures
dominate the same set of product measures while on $\Td$, for certain parameter
values, the free and minus fuzzy Potts measures dominate different product
measures. For the Ising model, Liggett and Steif proved that on $\Zd$ the plus

the standard system, fifteen comparison stars in the field of V733 Cep were
calibrated in BVRI bands. To construct a historical light curve of V733 Cep, a

Here, we present a systematic study where proteins bound to supported lipid

and convert it to the mean-square displacement of the diffusing proteins. Our

anomalous and normal diffusion. It enables us to investigate the onset of
anomalous diffusion, which takes place when the area coverage of membrane
proteins increases beyond approximately 5%. This transition region exhibits
pronounced spatial heterogeneities. Increasing the packing fraction further,
transport becomes more and more anomalous, manifested in a decrease of the

Here we discuss the spatio-temporal dynamics for two models of subdiffusion:
fractional Brownian motion and hindered motion due to immobile obstacles. We
show that the different microscopic mechanisms can be distinguished using
fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) by systematic variation of the
confocal detection area. We provide a theoretical framework for space-resolved
FCS by generalising FCS theory beyond the common assumption of spatially
Gaussian transport. We derive a master formula for the FCS autocorrelation
function, from which it is evident that the beam waist of an FCS experiment is
a similarly important parameter as the wavenumber of scattering experiments.
These results lead to scaling properties of the FCS correlation for both
models, which are tested by in silico experiments. Further, our scaling
prediction is compatible with the FCS half-value times reported by Wawrezinieck

There is no doubt that management practices are linked to the performance of an
organisation (Reynolds et al., 2005; Wall & Wood, 2005). Best practices have
been developed, but when it comes down to the actual application of these
guidelines considerable ambiguity remains regarding their effectiveness within
particular contexts (Siebers et al., forthcoming a). Most Operational Research
(OR) methods can only be used as analysis tools once management practices have
been implemented. Often they are not very useful for giving answers to
speculative 'what-if' questions, particularly when one is interested in the
development of the system over time rather than just the state of the system at
a certain point in time. Simulation can be used to analyse the operation of
dynamic and stochastic systems. ABS is particularly useful when complex
interactions between system entities exist, such as autonomous decision making
or negotiation. In an ABS model the researcher explicitly describes the
decision process of simulated actors at the micro level. Structures emerge at
the macro level as a result of the actions of the agents and their interactions
with other agents and the environment. 3 We will show how ABS experiments can
deal with testing and optimising management practices such as training,
empowerment or teamwork. Hence, questions such as ""will staff setting their own
break times improve performance?"" can be investigated.

supersymmetry, we propose to replace the DBI action by the pullback of a more
general polyform, which is no longer pure. This generalization provides
corrections to the energy-momentum tensor which give a positive contribution to
the cosmological constant. We find a de Sitter solution to all (bulk and

special ""polynomial"" strategy in Ore localizations of non-commutative

provide an algorithm to compute $U,V$ and $D$ with fraction-free entries such
that $UMV=D$ holds. The polynomial approach allows one to obtain more precise

experience quite moderate swell of coefficients and obtain uncomplicated

solving nontrivial practical problems. We present an implementation of

collective and tagged-particle density correlation functions obtained from
Brownian dynamics simulations for a polydisperse system of quasi-hard spheres
in the framework of the mode-coupling theory of the glass transition (MCT).
Asymptotic analyses show good agreement for the collective dynamics when
polydispersity effects are taken into account in a multi-component calculation,
but qualitative disagreement at small $q$ when the system is treated as
effectively monodisperse. The origin of the different small-$q$ behaviour is
attributed to the interplay between interdiffusion processes and structural
relaxation. Numerical solutions of the MCT equations are obtained taking
properly binned partial static structure factors from the simulations as input.
Accounting for a shift in the critical density, the collective density
correlation functions are well described by the theory at all densities
investigated in the simulations, with quantitative agreement best around the
maxima of the static structure factor, and worst around its minima. A
parameter-free comparison of the tagged-particle dynamics however reveals large
quantiative errors for small wave numbers that are connected to the well-known
decoupling of self-diffusion from structural relaxation and to dynamical
heterogeneities. While deviations from MCT behaviour are clearly seen in the
tagged-particle quantities for densities close to and on the liquid side of the
MCT glass transition, no such deviations are seen in the collective dynamics.

evolution of galaxies at z=0 we have used the DR7 catalogue of the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to reconstruct the 3-D distribution of 4132 galaxies
in 420 square degrees of the Coma supercluster, containing two rich clusters
(Coma and A1367), several groups, and many filamentary structures belonging to
the ""Great Wall"", at the approximate distance of 100 Mpc. At this distance the
galaxy census is complete to Mi=-17.5 mag, i.e. approx 4 mag fainter than M*.
The morphological classification of galaxies into early- (ellipticals) and
late-types (spirals) was carried out by inspection of individual SDSS images
and spectra. The density around each galaxies was determined in cylinders of 1
Mpc radius and 1000 km s^-1 half length. The color-luminosity relation was
derived for galaxies in bins morphological type and in four thresholds of
galaxy density-contrast, ranging from delta{1,1000} <= 0 (UL = the cosmic web);
0 < delta{1,1000} <= 4 (L = the loose groups); 4 < delta{1,1000} <= 20 (H = the
large groups and the cluster's outskirts) and delta{1,1000} > 20 (UH = the
cluster's cores). The fraction of early-type galaxies increases with the log of
the over-density. A well defined ""red sequence"" composed of early-type galaxies
exists in all environments at high luminosity, but it lacks of low luminosity
(dwarf) galaxies in the lowest density environment. Conversely low luminosity
isolated galaxies are predominantly of late-type. In other words the low
luminosity end of the distribution is dominated by red dE galaxies in clusters
and groups and by dwarf blue amorphous systems in the lowest density regions.
At z=0 we find evidence for strong evolution induced by the environment
(Nurture). Transformations take place mostly at low luminosity when star
forming dwarf galaxies inhabiting low density environments migrate into
amorphous passive dwarf ellipticals in their infall into denser regions. The
mechanism involves suppression of the star formation due to gas stripping,
without significant mass growth, as proposed by Boselli et al. (2008a). This
process is more efficient and fast in ambients of increasing density. In the
highest density environments (around clusters) the truncation of the star
formation happens fast enough (few 100 Myr) to produce the signature of
post-star-burst in galaxy spectra. PSB galaxies, that are in fact found
significantly clustered around the largest dynamical units, represent the
remnants of star forming isolated galaxies that had their star formation
violently suppressed during their infall in clusters in the last 0.5-1.5 Gyrs,
and the progenitors of future dEs.

angular resolution, near-IR images with HST and the adaptive optics instrument
NACO at the VLT including the laser guide star system PARSEC. Based on two
epochs of astrometric data we derive a minimum semi-major axis of 5.2 +- 0.8
AU. The assumption of a face-on circular orbit yields an orbital period of 72
+- 4 years and a total system mass of 30-60 Mjup. This places the masses of the
individual components of the system at the lower end of the mass regime of
brown dwarfs. The achieved photometry allowed a first spectral type
determination of L9 +- 1 for each component. In addition, this seems to be only
the fifth resolved L/T transition binary with a flux reversal. While ultimate
explanations for this effect are still owing, the 2MASS J03105986+1648155
system adds an important benchmark object for improving our understanding of
this remarkable evolutionary phase of brown dwarfs. Additionally, the
observational results of 2MASS J03105986+1648155 AB derived with the new PARSEC
AO system at the VLT show the importance of this technical capability. The
updated AO system allows us to significantly extend the sample of brown dwarfs
observable with high-resolution from the ground and hence to reveal more of
their physical properties.

In order to understand the self-tuning mechanism leading to $\Lambda = 0$ we
discuss in detail the most general warped geometries with maximal
four-dimensional symmetry and $SO(d-4)$ isometry of internal space. While the
solutions of the $d$-dimensional field equations admit singular spaces with
arbitrary $\Lambda$, the extremum condition for $\Gamma$ imposes additional
restrictions which result in $\Lambda = 0$. In cosmology, the dilatation
symmetric fixed point may only be reached for asymptotic time $t \to \infty$.
At finite $t$ dilatation anomalies result in an effective potential and mass
for the pseudo-dilaton or cosmon and in dark energy.

dust emission, possibly originating from small spinning dust grains. We present
Cosmic Background Imager (CBI) 31 GHz data of LDN1621, a diffuse dark cloud to
the north of LDN1622 in a region known as Orion East. A broken ring with
diameter g\approx 20 arcmin of diffuse emission is detected at 31 GHz, at
\approx 20-30 mJy beam$^{-1}$ with an angular resolution of \approx 5 arcmin.
The ring-like structure is highly correlated with Far Infra-Red emission at
$12-100 \mu$m with correlation coefficients of r \approx 0.7-0.8, significant
at $\sim10\sigma$. Multi-frequency data are used to place constraints on other
components of emission that could be contributing to the 31 GHz flux. An
analysis of the GB6 survey maps at 4.85 GHz yields a $3\sigma$ upper limit on
free-free emission of 7.2 mJy beam$^{-1}$ ($\la 30 per cent of the observed
flux) at the CBI resolution. The bulk of the 31 GHz flux therefore appears to
be mostly due to dust radiation. Aperture photometry, at an angular resolution
of 13 arcmin and with an aperture of diameter 30 arcmin, allowed the use of
IRAS maps and the {\it WMAP} 5-year W-band map at 93.5 GHz. A single modified
blackbody model was fitted to the data to estimate the contribution from
thermal dust, which amounts to $\sim$ 10 per cent at 31 GHz. In this model, an
excess of 1.52\pm 0.66 Jy (2.3\sigma) is seen at 31 GHz. Future high frequency
$\sim$ 100-1000 GHz data, such as those from the {\it Planck} satellite, are
required to accurately determine the thermal dust contribution at 31 GHz.
Correlations with the IRAS $100 \mu$m gave a coupling coefficient of
$18.1\pm4.4 \mu$K (MJy/sr)$^{-1}$, consistent with the values found for
LDN1622.

and one risky asset, with the latter's price following a diffusion with
stochastic volatility. In the current financial market especially, it is
important to include stochastic volatility in the risky asset's price process.
Given the rate of consumption, we find the optimal investment strategy for the
individual who wishes to minimize the probability of going bankrupt. To solve
this minimization problem, we use techniques from stochastic optimal control.

Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The sample of radio sources are selected from
the catalogue of Kimball & Ivezi\'c (2008) with flux densities at 325, 1400 and
4850 MHz, using WENSS, NVSS and GB6 radio surveys and from flux measurements at
74 MHz taken from VLA Low-frequency Sky Survey \citep{cohen}. We study
radiogalaxy spectral properties using radio colour-colour diagrams and find
that our sample follows a single power law from 74 to 4850 MHz. The spectral
index vs. spectroscopic redshift relation ($\alpha-z$) is not significant for
our sample of radio sources. We analyze a subsample of radio sources associated
with clusters of galaxies identified from the maxBCG catalogue and find that
about 40% of radio sources with ultra steep spectra (USS, $\alpha<-1$, where
$S_\nu \propto \nu^{\alpha}$) are associated with galaxy clusters or groups of
galaxies. We construct a Hubble diagram of USS radio sources in the optical $r$
band up to $z\sim0$.8 and compare our results with those for normal galaxies
selected from different optical surveys and find that USS radio sources are
around as luminous as the central galaxies in the maxBCG cluster sample and
typically more than 4 magnitudes brighter than normal galaxies at $z\sim0$.3.
We study correlations between spectral index, richness and luminosity of
clusters associated with radio sources. We find that USS at low redshift are
rare, most of them reside in regions of unusually high ambient density, such of
those found in rich cluster of galaxies. Our results also suggest that clusters
of galaxies associated with steeper than the average spectra have higher
richness counts and are populated by luminous galaxies in comparison with those
environments associated to radio sources with flatter than the average spectra.
A plausible explanation for our results is that radio emission is more pressure
confined in higher gas density environments such as those found in rich
clusters of galaxies and as a consequence radio lobes in rich galaxy clusters
will expand adiabatically and lose energy via synchrotron and inverse Compton
losses, resulting in a steeper radio spectra.

"1004.2870","Uwe Aickelin","Uwe Aickelin","Nurse Rostering with Genetic Algorithms","22 pages, Young Operational Research Conference 12","Young Operational Research Conference 12, 1998",,,"cs.AI cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In recent years genetic algorithms have emerged as a useful tool for the
heuristic solution of complex discrete optimisation problems. In particular
there has been considerable interest in their use in tackling problems arising
in the areas of scheduling and timetabling. However, the classical genetic
algorithm paradigm is not well equipped to handle constraints and successful
implementations usually require some sort of modification to enable the search
to exploit problem specific knowledge in order to overcome this shortcoming.
This paper is concerned with the development of a family of genetic algorithms
for the solution of a nurse rostering problem at a major UK hospital. The
hospital is made up of wards of up to 30 nurses. Each ward has its own group of
nurses whose shifts have to be scheduled on a weekly basis. In addition to
fulfilling the minimum demand for staff over three daily shifts, nurses' wishes
and qualifications have to be taken into account. The schedules must also be
seen to be fair, in that unpopular shifts have to be spread evenly amongst all
nurses, and other restrictions, such as team nursing and special conditions for
senior staff, have to be satisfied. The basis of the family of genetic
algorithms is a classical genetic algorithm consisting of n-point crossover,
single-bit mutation and a rank-based selection. The solution space consists of
all schedules in which each nurse works the required number of shifts, but the
remaining constraints, both hard and soft, are relaxed and penalised in the
fitness function. The talk will start with a detailed description of the
problem and the initial implementation and will go on to highlight the
shortcomings of such an approach, in terms of the key element of balancing
feasibility, i.e. covering the demand and work regulations, and quality, as
measured by the nurses' preferences. A series of experiments involving
parameter adaptation, niching, intelligent weights, delta coding, local hill
climbing, migration and special selection rules will then be outlined and it
will be shown how a series of these enhancements were able to eradicate these
difficulties. Results based on several months' real data will be used to
measure the impact of each modification, and to show that the final algorithm
is able to compete with a tabu search approach currently employed at the
hospital. The talk will conclude with some observations as to the overall
quality of this approach to this and similar problems.
