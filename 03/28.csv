constellation Centaurus at $\approx$ 78.3 pc from the Sun whose principal
component is a white (A-type) giant. It does not seem to appear neither in
general catalogues of radial velocities available at SIMBAD nor in
authoritative Garcia-Sanchez et al. papers on stellar encounters with the solar
system. Awaiting for the value $v_r$ of its radial velocity, uknown to the

within 1 ly and 1 pc from the Sun in linear approximation. A very accurate
value of its total proper motion is also extremely important. In the case of
$v_r=-100$ km/s and most ""advantageous"" HIP2 data, HD 107914 could pass as near
as 8380 AU from the Sun in an almost direct collision course with the inner

HIP 60503 could be the creator of peculiar trajectories of detached

recently elaborated Doplicher, Fredenhagen, Roberts and Amorim (DFRA)
noncommutative (NC) space which is a minimal extension of the DFR space. In
this DRFA space, the object of noncommutativity ($\theta^{\mu\nu}$) is a
variable of the NC system and has a canonical conjugate momentum. The DFRA
formalism is constructed in an extended space-time with independent degrees of
freedom associated with the object of noncommutativity $\theta^{\mu\nu}$. A
consistent algebra involving the enlarged set of canonical operators is
described, which permits one to construct theories that are dynamically
invariant under the action of the rotation group. A consistent classical
mechanics formulation is analyzed in such a way that, under quantization, it
furnishes a NC quantum theory with interesting results. The Dirac formalism for
constrained Hamiltonian systems is considered and the object of
noncommutativity $\theta^{ij}$ plays a fundamental role as an independent
quantity. It is also explained about the generalized Dirac equation issue, that
the fermionic field depends not only on the ordinary coordinates but on
$\theta^{\mu\nu}$ as well. The dynamical symmetry content of such fermionic
theory is discussed, and we show that its action is invariant under ${\cal
P}'$. In the last part of this work we analyze the complex scalar fields using
this new framework. As said above, in a first quantized formalism,
$\theta^{\mu\nu}$ and its canonical momentum $\pi_{\mu\nu}$ are seen as
operators living in some Hilbert space. In a second quantized formalism
perspective, we show an explicit form for the extended Poincar\'e generators
and the same algebra is generated via generalized Heisenberg relations. We also
consider a source term and construct the general solution for the complex
scalar fields using the Green function technique.

most useful for very nearby systems in which low temperature planets with red

distributed according to a power law with $dN \propto M^{\alpha} a^{\beta} dM

a distribution with $\alpha = -1.1$ and $\beta = -0.46$, truncated at 110 AU,

and $\beta$ are significant because they represent the most planet-rich case
consistent with current statistics from radial velocity observations. With 90%
confidence no more than 8.1% of stars like those in our survey have systems
with three widely spaced, massive planets like the A-star HR 8799. Our
observations show that giant planets in long-period orbits around sun-like
stars are rare, confirming the results of shorter-wavelength surveys, and
increasing the robustness of the conclusion.

poor model of how people navigate the Web. Using the empirical traffic patterns
generated by a thousand users, we characterize several properties of Web
traffic that cannot be reproduced by Markovian models. We examine both
aggregate statistics capturing collective behavior, such as page and link
traffic, and individual statistics, such as entropy and session size. No model
currently explains all of these empirical observations simultaneously. We show
that all of these traffic patterns can be explained by an agent-based model
that takes into account several realistic browsing behaviors. First, agents
maintain individual lists of bookmarks (a non-Markovian memory mechanism) that
are used as teleportation targets. Second, agents can retreat along visited
links, a branching mechanism that also allows us to reproduce behaviors such as
the use of a back button and tabbed browsing. Finally, agents are sustained by
visiting novel pages of topical interest, with adjacent pages being more
topically related to each other than distant ones. This modulates the
probability that an agent continues to browse or starts a new session, allowing
us to recreate heterogeneous session lengths. The resulting model is capable of
reproducing the collective and individual behaviors we observe in the empirical
data, reconciling the narrowly focused browsing patterns of individual users
with the extreme heterogeneity of aggregate traffic measurements. This result
allows us to identify a few salient features that are necessary and sufficient
to interpret the browsing patterns observed in our data. In addition to the
descriptive and explanatory power of such a model, our results may lead the way

have no incentive to lie about their true values (incentive compatible) and for
which no agent will seek to exchange outcomes with another (envy-free).
Mechanisms satisfying each requirement separately have been studied
extensively, but there are few results on mechanisms achieving both. We are
interested in those allocations for which there exist payments such that the
resulting mechanism is simultaneously incentive compatible and envy-free.
Cyclic monotonicity is a characterization of incentive compatible allocations,
local efficiency is a characterization for envy-free allocations. We combine
the above to give a characterization for allocations which are both incentive
compatible and envy free. We show that even for allocations that allow payments
leading to incentive compatible mechanisms, and other payments leading to envy
free mechanisms, there may not exist any payments for which the mechanism is
simultaneously incentive compatible and envy-free. The characterization that we
give lets us compute the set of Pareto-optimal mechanisms that trade off envy
freeness for incentive compatibility.

performed to characterize the stellar and ionized gas structure as well as the
extinction distribution, physical properties and kinematics of the ionized gas
in the central ~210pc x 130pc. We utilized optical integral field spectroscopy
(IFS) data obtained with FLAMES. A detailed extinction map for the ionized gas
in NGC5253 shows that the largest extinction is associated with the prominent
Giant HII region. There is an offset of ~0.5"" between the peak of the optical
continuum and the extinction peak in agreement with findings in the infrared.
We found that stars suffer less extinction than gas by a factor of 0.33. The
[SII]l6717/[SII]l6731 map shows an electron density (N_e) gradient declining
from the peak of emission in Ha (790cm^-3) outwards, while the argon line ratio
traces areas with $N_e~4200 - 6200cm^(-3). The area polluted with extra
nitrogen, as deduced from the excess [NII]/Ha, extends up to distances of 3.3""
(~60pc) from the maximum pollution, which is offset by ~1.5"" from the peak of
continuum emission. Wolf-Rayet features are distributed in an irregular pattern
over a larger area (~100pc x 100pc) and associated with young stellar clusters.
We measured He^+ abundances over most of the field of view and values of
He^++/H^+<~0.0005 in localized areas which do not coincide, in general, with
the areas presenting W-R emission or extra nitrogen. The line profiles are
complex. Up to three emission components were needed to reproduce them. One of
them, associated with the giant HII region, presents supersonic widths and
[NII] and [SII] emission lines shifted up to 40km/s with respect to Ha.
Similarly, one of the narrow components presents offsets in the [NII] line of
<~20km/s. This is the first time that maps with such velocity offsets for a
starburst galaxy have been presented.

static within a thermal medium. Combining this same bulk transformation with

central galaxy of its lowest entropy gas and preventing star-formation. This
low entropy gas was entrained with and uplifted by the buoyantly rising
relativistic plasma, forming long ""arms"". These arms are likely oriented within
15-30 degrees of our line-of-sight. The mass of the uplifted gas in the arms is
comparable to the gas mass in the approximately spherically symmetric 3.8 kpc
core, demonstrating that the AGN has a profound effect on its immediate
surroundings. The coolest X-ray emitting gas in M87 has a temperature of ~0.5
keV and is spatially coincident with Halpha+NII nebulae, forming a multiphase
medium where the cooler gas phases are arranged in magnetized filaments. We
place strong upper limits of 0.06 Msun/yr on the amount of plasma cooling
radiatively from 0.5 keV and show that a uniform, volume-averaged heating
mechanism could not be preventing the cool gas from further cooling. All of the
bright Halpha filaments appear in the downstream region of the <3 Myr old shock
front, at smaller radii than ~0.6'. We suggest that shocks induce shearing
around the filaments, thereby promoting mixing of the cold gas with the ambient
hot ICM via instabilities. By bringing hot thermal particles into contact with
the cool, line-emitting gas, mixing can supply the power and ionizing particles
needed to explain the observed optical spectra. Mixing of the coolest X-ray
emitting plasma with the cold optical line emitting filamentary gas promotes
efficient conduction between the two phases, allowing non-radiative cooling
which could explain the lack of X-ray gas with temperatures under 0.5 keV.

convex and monotone with respect to the standard positive cone. The notion of
tangential stability for fixed points and periodic points is introduced, which
is weaker than Lyapunov stability. Among others we show that the set of
tangentially stable fixed points is isomorphic to a convex inf-semilattice, and
a criterion is given for the existence of a unique tangentially stable fixed
point. We also show that periods of tangentially stable periodic points are
orders of permutations on $n$ letters, where $n$ is the dimension of the

have relied on the assumption that elementary discourse units (EDUs) in a

Unfortunately, this assumption turns out to be too strong, for some theories of
discourse like SDRT allows for nested discourse units. In this paper, we
present a simple approach to discourse segmentation that is able to produce
nested EDUs. Our approach builds on standard multi-class classification
techniques combined with a simple repairing heuristic that enforces global
coherence. Our system was developed and evaluated on the first round of
annotations provided by the French Annodis project (an ongoing effort to create
a discourse bank for French). Cross-validated on only 47 documents (1,445

the rheological behaviour of sediments is typically modelled in terms of a
nonlinear relationship between effective pressure $p_e$ and porosity $\phi$,
that is $p_e=p_e(\phi)$. The compaction law is essentially a poroelastic one.
However, viscous compaction due to pressure solution becomes important at
larger depths and causes this relationship to become more akin to a viscous
rheology. A generalised viscoelastic compaction model of Maxwell type is
formulated, and different styles of nonlinear behaviour are asymptotically
analysed and compared in this paper.

systems with non-relativistic conformal symmetry have made use of consistent
truncations of D=10 and D=11 supergravity retaining some massive modes in the
Kaluza-Klein tower. In this paper we focus on reductions of IIB supergravity to
five dimensions on a Sasaki-Einstein manifold, and extend these previous
truncations to encompass the entire bosonic sector of gauged D=5, N=2
supergravity coupled to massive multiplets up to the second Kaluza-Klein level.
We conjecture that a necessary condition for the consistency of massive
truncations is to only retain the lowest modes in the massive trajectories of
the Kaluza-Klein mode decomposition of the original fields. This is an
extension of the well-known result that consistent truncations may be obtained
by restricting to the singlet sector of the internal symmetry group.

We provide
the definition of a computable physical model to answer this question. The
connection between our definition and Kreisel's notion of a mechanistic theory
is discussed, and several examples of computable physical models are given,
including models which feature discrete motion, a model which features
non-discrete continuous motion, and probabilistic models such as radioactive
decay. We show how computable physical models on effective topological spaces
can be formulated using the theory of type-two effectivity (TTE). Various
common operations on computable physical models are described, such as the
operation of coarse-graining and the formation of statistical ensembles. The
definition of a computable physical model also allows for a precise
formalization of the computable universe hypothesis--the claim that all the
laws of physics are computable.
