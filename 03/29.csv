crystals of Ba(Fe_(1-x)Ru_x)_2As_2 for x ranging from 0 to 0.5. The isovalent
substitution of Fe by Ru leads to an increase of the a parameter and a decrease
of the c parameter, resulting in a strong increase of the AsFeAs angle and a
decrease of the As height above the Fe planes. Upon Ru substitution, the
magnetic order is progressively suppressed and superconductivity emerges for x
> 0.15, with an optimal Tc ~ 20K at x = 0.35 and coexistence of magnetism and
superconductivity between these two Ru contents. Moreover, the Hall coefficient
RH which is always negative and decreases with temperature in BaFe2As2, is
found to increase here with decreasing T and even change sign for x > 0.15. For
x_Ru = 0.35, photo-emission studies have shown that the number of holes and
electrons are similar with n_e = n_h ~ 0.11, that is twice larger than found in
BaFe2As2 [1]. Using this estimate, we find that the transport properties of
Ba(Fe_0.65Ru_0.35)_2As_2 can be accounted for by the conventional multiband
description for a compensated semi-metal. In particular, our results show that
the mobility of holes is strongly enhanced upon Ru addition and overcomes that
of electrons at low temperature when x_Ru > 0.15.

asexual populations evolving on complex fitness landscapes may achieve a higher
fitness than large ones due to the increased heterogeneity of adaptive
trajectories. Here we introduce a class of haploid three-locus fitness
landscapes that allows to investigate this scenario in a precise and
quantitative way.
  Results: Our main result derived analytically shows how the probability of
choosing the path of largest initial fitness increase grows with the population
size. This makes large populations more likely to get trapped at local fitness
peaks and implies an advantage of small populations at intermediate time
scales. The range of population sizes where this effect is operative coincides
with the onset of clonal interference. Additional studies using ensembles of
random fitness landscapes show that the results achieved for a particular
choice of three-locus landscape parameters are robust and also persist as the
number of loci increases.
  Conclusions: Our study indicates that an advantage for small populations is
likely whenever the fitness landscape contains local maxima. The advantage
appears at intermediate time scales, which are long enough for trapping at
local fitness maxima to have occurred but too short for peak escape by the
creation of multiple mutants.

direction of axon growth, the mean fascicle size and emergent time scales grow
monotonically, while the degree of sorting of fascicles by axon type has a
maximum at a finite distance. To understand the emergence of slow time scales,
we develop an analytical framework to analyze the interaction between
neighboring fascicles.

1/N-expansion. We introduce a spatial anisotropy in the exchange couplings and
show that the effective coupling constant in the CP^{N-1} model is an
increasing function of the anisotropy. For the SU(N) AF Heisenberg model, which
is a specific case of the Sp(N) model, we found that phase transition from the

increased. In the vicinity of the SU(N) symmetric point, this phase structure
is retained. However as a parameter that controls explicit breaking of the
SU(N) symmetry is increased, a new phase, which is similar to the spiral-spin
phase with a nematic order in frustrated SU(2) spin systems, appears. It is
shown that at that phase transition point, a local SU(2) gauge symmetry with
composite SU(2) gauge field appears in the low-energy sector. It is another
example of symmetry-enhancement phenomenon at low energies. We also introduce a

strong negative component to their energy density at the planckian and
transplanckian scales, conceivably resulting in a sequestration of the
transplanckian field degrees of freedom. Quantum fluctuations then allow these
to tunnel into cisplanckian configurations to seed inflation and conventional
observed physics: propagating modes of QFT in a geometry which responds to the
existence of these new modes through the energy constraint of general
relativity, H^2 = \rho/3. That this tunnelling results in geometries and field
configurations that are homogeneous allows for an estimate of the mass of the
inflaton, m=O(10^{-6}), and the amplitude of the inflaton condensate,
\phiav=O(10), both consistent with phenomenology.

to quantum dynamics of an isolated macroscopic system. Inspired by the two
important works in 2009 and in 1929, we have noted that a condition we call
""thermodynamic normality"" for a macroscopic observable guarantees the approach
to equilibrium (in the sense that a measurement of the observable at time $t$
almost certainly yields a result close to the corresponding microcanonical
average for a sufficiently long and typical $t$). A crucial point is that we
make no assumptions on the initial state of the system, except that its energy
is distributed close to a certain macroscopic value. We also present three
(rather artificial) models in which the thermodynamic normality can be
established, thus providing concrete examples in which the approach to
equilibrium is rigorously justified. Note that this kind of results which hold
for ANY initial state are never possible in classical systems. We are thus
dealing with a mechanism which is peculiar to quantum systems. The present note
is written in a self-contained (and hopefully readable) manner. It only
requires basic knowledge in quantum physics and equilibrium statistical
mechanics.

two components: a quiescent disk-like component at the galaxy systemic velocity

that an atomic force microscope in a set-up as an electrostatic force

Imaging was used to investigate laterally applied electric fields in this type

very low standby power consumption with a high driving capability and operates

Vittoz at al [3] reported that slew rate can be improved by adaptive biasing

Galois field, using multi-valued logic (MVL). Quaternary to binary and binary
to quaternary converters are designed using down literal circuits. Negation in
modular arithmetic is designed with only one gate. Logic design of each
operation is achieved by reducing the terms using Karnaugh diagrams, keeping
minimum number of gates and depth of net in to consideration. Quaternary
multiplier circuit is proposed to achieve required optimization. Simulation

describing binding structure which is higher-level than traditional techniques.
These approaches have spawned two different communities which have developed
along similar lines but with subtle differences that make them difficult to
relate. The nominal abstract syntax community has devices like names,
freshness, name-abstractions with variable capture, and the new-quantifier,
whereas the higher-order abstract syntax community has devices like
lambda-binders, lambda-conversion, raising, and the nabla-quantifier. This
paper aims to unify these communities and provide a concrete correspondence
between their different devices. In particular, we develop a
semantics-preserving translation from alpha-Prolog, a nominal abstract syntax
based logic programming language, to G-, a higher-order abstract syntax based
logic programming language. We also discuss higher-order judgments, a common
and powerful tool for specifications with higher-order abstract syntax, and we
show how these can be incorporated into G-. This establishes G- as a language
with the power of higher-order abstract syntax, the fine-grained variable
control of nominal specifications, and the desirable properties of higher-order

have a full comprehension of the role played by the metallicity, star formation
rate (SFR), morphology, and color. The interplay of these parameters at
different redshifts will substantially affect the evolution of galaxies and, as
a consequence, the evolution of them will provide important clues and
constraints on the galaxy evolution models. In this work we focus on the
evolution of the SFR, metallicity of the gas, and morphology of galaxies at low
redshift in search of signs of evolution. We use the S2N2 diagnostic diagram as
a tool to classify star--forming, composite, and AGN galaxies. We analyzed the
evolution of the three principal BPT diagrams, estimating the SFR and specific
SFR (SSFR) for our samples of galaxies, studying the luminosity and
mass-metallicity relations, and analyzing the morphology of our sample of
galaxies through the g-r color, concentration index, and SSFR. We found that
the S2N2 is a reliable diagram to classify star--forming, composite, and AGNs
galaxies. We demonstrate that the three principal BPT diagrams show an
evolution toward higher values of [OIII]5007/Hb due to a metallicity decrement.
We found an evolution in the mass-metallicity relation of ~ 0.2 dex for the
redshift range 0.3 < z < 0.4 compared to our local one. From the analysis of
the evolution of the SFR and SSFR as a function of the stellar mass and
metallicity, we discovered a group of galaxies with higher SFR and SSFR at all
redshift samples, whose morphology is consistent with those of late-type
galaxies. Finally, the comparison of our local (0.04<z<0.1) with our higher
redshift sample (0.3<z<0.4), show that the metallicity, the SFR and morphology,
evolve toward lower values of metallicity, higher SFRs, and late--type
morphologies for the redshift range 0.3<z<0.4

circuit quantum electrodynamics. The back-action on the qubits has two
qualitatively different contributions. One is an unavoidable dephasing in one
of the parity subspaces, arising during the transient time of switching on the
measurement. The other part is a stochastic rotation of the phase in the same
subspace, which persists during the whole measurement. The latter can be
determined from the full measurement record, using the method of state
estimation. Our main result is that the outcome of this phase determination
process is {\em independent} of the initial state in the state estimation
procedure. The procedure can thus be used in a measurement situation, where the
initial state is unknown. We discuss how this feed-back method can be used to
achieve a high fidelity parity measurement for realistic values of the
cavity-qubit coupling strength. Finally, we discuss the robustness of the
feed-back procedure towards errors in the measurement record.

globular clusters have on their relative age determinations is studied. The two
most widely used relative age-dating methods, horizontal and vertical, together
with the more recent relative MS-fitting method, were carefully analyzed on a
purely theoretical basis. The BaSTI library was adopted to perform the present
analysis. We find that relative ages derived using the horizontal and vertical
methods are largely dependent on the initial He content and heavy element
distribution. Unrecognized cluster-to-cluster chemical abundance differences
can lead to an error in the derived relative ages as large as ~0.5 (or ~6 Gyr
if an age of 12.8 Gyr is adopted for normalization), and even larger for some
extreme cases. It is shown that the relative MS-fitting method is by far the
age-dating technique for which undetected cluster-to-cluster differences in the
He abundance have less impact. Present results are used in order to pose
constraints on the maximum possible spread in the He and CNONa elements
abundances on the basis of the estimates - taken from the literature - of the
Galactic globular clusters relative age dispersion obtained with the various
relative age-dating techniques. Finally, it is shown that the age-metallicity
relation found for young Galactic globular clusters by the GC Treasury program
is a real age sequence and cannot be produced by variations in the He and/or

For example we study tri-bimaximal (TB) mixing via constrained sequential

involves a NLO correction suppressed by the small reactor angle and show that

the semi-classical approach uncovered the implicit assumption of a close
connection between geometry and smoothness structure. But both structures,
geometry and smoothness, are independent of each other. In this paper we
calculate the ""smoothness structure"" part of the path integral in quantum
gravity assuming that the ""sum over geometries"" is already given. For that

E(n) of elliptic surfaces. We mainly focus our attention to the K3 surfaces
E(2). Then we assume that every exotic smoothness structure of the K3 surface

over the Fibonacci LSB data-hiding technique proposed by Battisti et al. First
we mathematically model and generalize our approach. Then we propose our novel
technique, based on decomposition of a number (pixel-value) in sum of prime
numbers. The particular representation generates a different set of (virtual)
bit-planes altogether, suitable for embedding purposes. They not only allow one
to embed secret message in higher bit-planes but also do it without much
distortion, with a much better stego-image quality, and in a reliable and
secured manner, guaranteeing efficient retrieval of secret message. A
comparative performance study between the classical Least Significant Bit
(LSB)method, the Fibonacci LSB data-hiding technique and our proposed schemes
has been done. Analysis indicates that image quality of the stego-image hidden
by the technique using Fibonacci decomposition improves against that using
simple LSB substitution method, while the same using the prime decomposition
method improves drastically against that using Fibonacci decomposition
technique. Experimental results show that, the stego-image is visually
indistinguishable from the original cover-image.

the Internet prompts commensurately growing privacy concerns. Digital data
often lingers indefinitely and users lose its control. This motivates the
desire to restrict content availability to an expiration time set by the data
owner. This paper presents and formalizes the notion of Ephemeral Publishing
(EphPub), to prevent the access to expired content. We propose an efficient and
robust protocol that builds on the Domain Name System (DNS) and its caching
mechanism. With EphPub, sensitive content is published encrypted and the key
material is distributed, in a steganographic manner, to randomly selected and
independent resolvers. The availability of content is then limited by the
evanescence of DNS cache entries. The EphPub protocol is transparent to
existing applications, and does not rely on trusted hardware, centralized
servers, or user proactive actions. We analyze its robustness and show that it
incurs a negligible overhead on the DNS infrastructure. We also perform a
large-scale study of the caching behavior of 900K open DNS resolvers. Finally,
we propose Firefox and Thunderbird extensions that provide ephemeral publishing
capabilities, as well as a command-line tool to create ephemeral files.

there is no strong dependence of the jet properties on black hole spin. In

cognitive operators' spectrum leasing and pricing strategies, taking into
account operators' heterogeneity in leasing costs and users' heterogeneity in

operators and users as a three-stage dynamic game, where operators make
simultaneous spectrum leasing and pricing decisions in Stages I and II, and
users make purchase decisions in Stage III. Using backward induction, we are
able to completely characterize the game's equilibria. We show that both
operators make the equilibrium leasing and pricing decisions based on simple
threshold policies. Moreover, two operators always choose the same equilibrium
price despite their difference in leasing costs. Each user receives the same
signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) at the equilibrium, and the obtained payoff is
linear in its transmission power and channel gain. We also compare the duopoly
equilibrium with the coordinated case where two operators cooperate to maximize
their total profit. We show that the maximum loss of total profit due to
operators' competition is no larger than 25%. The users, however, always
benefit from operators' competition in terms of their payoffs. We show that
most of these insights are robust in the general SNR regime.

Dirac-Brueckner-Hartree-Fock (DBHF) calculations us- ing realistic
nucleon-nucleon interactions like the Bonn potentials, which are able to
reproduce satisfactorily the properties of symmetric nuclear matter without the
need for 3-body forces, as is necessary in non-relativistic BHF calculations.
However, the DBHF formalism is still too com- plicated to be used directly for
finite nuclei. We argue that a possible route is to define effective
Lagrangians with density-dependent nucleon-meson coupling vertices, which can
be used in the Relativistic Hartree (or Relativistic Mean Field (RMF)) or
preferrably in the Relativistic Hartree- Fock (RHF) approach. The
density-dependence is matched to the nuclear matter DBHF results. We review the
present status of nuclear matter DBHF calculations and discuss the various
schemes to construct the self-energy, which lead to differences in the
predictions. We also discuss how effective Lagrangians have been constructed

is still debated, and is an important issue for correctly modeling
extracellular potentials. Here, we first show theoretically that if the medium
is resistive, the frequency scaling should be the same for electroencephalogram
(EEG) and magnetoencephalogram (MEG) signals at low frequencies (<10 Hz). To
test this prediction, we analyzed the spectrum of simultaneous EEG and MEG
measurements in four human subjects. The frequency scaling of EEG displays
coherent variations across the brain, in general between 1/f and 1/f^2, and
tends to be smaller in parietal/temporal regions. In a given region, although
the variability of the frequency scaling exponent was higher for MEG compared
to EEG, both signals consistently scale with a different exponent. In some
cases, the scaling was similar, but only when the signal-to-noise ratio of the
MEG was low. Several methods of noise correction for environmental and
instrumental noise were tested, and they all increased the difference between
EEG and MEG scaling. In conclusion, there is a significant difference in
frequency scaling between EEG and MEG, which can be explained if the
extracellular medium (including other layers such as dura matter and skull) is
globally non-resistive.

planet with a period of approximately 10000 days. The three planet model is
found to be 10^5 times more probable than the next most probable model which is
a two planet model. The nonlinear model fitting is accomplished with a new
hybrid Markov chain Monte Carlo (HMCMC) algorithm which incorporates parallel
tempering, simulated annealing and genetic crossover operations. Each of these
features facilitate the detection of a global minimum in chi-squared. By
combining all three, the HMCMC greatly increases the probability of realizing
this goal. When applied to the Kepler problem it acts as a powerful
multi-planet Kepler periodogram. The measured periods are 1078 \pm 2,

neutrino long-baseline experiment. It is shown that T2KK can constrain the
parameters $|\epsilon_{ee}|\lesssim 1$, $|\epsilon_{e\tau}|\lesssim 0.2$. It is
also shown that if $|\epsilon_{e\tau}|$ and $\theta_{13}$ are large, then T2KK
can determine the Dirac phase and the phase of $\epsilon_{e\tau}$ separately,
due to the information at the two baselines. We also provide an argument that
the components $|\epsilon_{\alpha\mu}|$ $(\alpha=e,\mu,\tau)$ must be small for
the disappearance oscillation probability to be consistent with high-energy
atmospheric neutrino data, which justifies our premise that these quantities
are negligible.

space of degree $d\geq 1$ holomorphic maps $\Sigma\ra \CP^k$. In theoretical
physics this arises as the moduli space of charge $d$ lumps (or instantons) in
the $\CP^k$ model on $\Sigma$. There is a natural Riemannian metric on this
moduli space, called the $L^2$ metric, whose geometry is conjectured to control
the low energy dynamics of $\CP^k$ lumps. In this paper an explicit formula for
the $L^2$ metric on of $\h_{d,k}(\Sigma)$ in the special case $d=1$ and
$\Sigma=S^2$ is computed. Essential use is made of the k\""ahler property of the
$L^2$ metric, and its invariance under a natural action of $G=U(k+1)\times
U(2)$. It is shown that {\em all} $G$-invariant k\""ahler metrics on

with respect to the $L^2$ metric is computed explicitly and is shown to agree
with a general formula for $\h_{d,k}(\Sigma)$ recently conjectured by Baptista.
The area of a family of twice punctured spheres in $\h_{d,k}(\Sigma)$ is
computed exactly, and a formal argument is presented in support of Baptista's

amplification by an active process in the mechanoreceptive hair cells. In most
vertebrates the active process stems from the active motility of hair bundles.
The mammalian cochlea exhibits an additional form of mechanical activity termed
electromotility: its outer hair cells (OHCs) change length upon electrical
stimulation. The relative contributions of these two mechanisms to the active
process in the mammalian inner ear is the subject of intense current debate.
Here we show that active hair-bundle motility and electromotility can together
implement an efficient mechanism for amplification that functions like a
ratchet: sound-evoked forces acting on the basilar membrane are transmitted to
the hair bundles whereas electromotility decouples active hair-bundle forces
from the basilar membrane. This unidirectional coupling can extend the hearing
range well below the resonant frequency of the basilar membrane. It thereby
provides a concept for low-frequency hearing that accounts for a variety of
unexplained experimental observations from the cochlear apex, including the
shape and phase behavior of apical tuning curves, their lack of significant
nonlinearities, and the shape changes of threshold tuning curves of auditory
nerve fibers along the cochlea. The ratchet mechanism constitutes a general
design principle for implementing mechanical amplification in engineering
applications.

nanoparticles of oxides containing small quantities of magnetic dopants remains
controversial. Some regard these materials as dilute magnetic semiconductors,
while others think they are ferromagnetic only because the magnetic dopants
form secondary ferromagnetic impurity phases such as cobalt metal or magnetite.
There are also reports in d0 systems and other defective oxides that contain no
magnetic ions. Here, we investigate TiO2 (rutile) containing 1 - 5% of iron
cations and find that the room-temperature ferromagnetism of films prepared by
pulsed-laser deposition is not due to magnetic ordering of the iron. The films
are neither dilute magnetic semiconductors nor hosts to an iron-based
ferromagnetic impurity phase. A new model is developed for defect-related
ferromagnetism which involves a spin-split defect band populated by charge
transfer from a proximate charge reservoir in the present case a mixture Fe2+
and Fe3+ ions in the oxide lattice. The phase diagram for the model shows how
inhomogeneous Stoner ferromagnetism depends on the total number of electrons
Ntot, the Stoner exchange integral I and the defect bandwidth W; the band
occupancy is governed by the d-d Coulomb interaction U. There are regions of
ferromagnetic metal, half-metal and insulator as well as nonmagnetic metal and
insulator. A characteristic feature of the high-temperature Stoner magnetism is
an an anhysteretic magnetization curve which is practically temperature
independent below room temperature. This is related to a wandering
ferromagnetic axis which is determined by local dipole fields. The
magnetization is limited by the defect concentration, not by the 3d doping.
Only 1-2 % of the volume of the films is magnetically ordered.

tidal stripping of dwarf stars leads to the formation of strong tidal tails
that are typically aligned with the line of sight of an observer positioned
close to the host center. The stars from the tails contaminate the kinematic
samples leading to a velocity dispersion profile increasing with the projected

non-spherical for a long time leading to an overestimate of its mass if it is

  Our main results treat the class of measure preserving functions. We obtain
an exact description of the set of realizable distributions in this case: for

(0.9<z<2.1) xray luminous quasars (L_2-10 ~ 10^44 erg s-1) selected from the
HELLAS2XMM survey. The SEDs are described by a multi-component model including
a stellar component, an AGN component and a starburst. The majority (~80%) of
the sources show moderate optical depth (tau_9.7um<3) and the derived column
densities N_H are consistent with the xray inferred values (10^22 <N_H< 3x10^23
cm-2) for most of the objects, confirming that the sources are moderately
obscured Compton-thin AGN. Accretion luminosities in the range 5x10^44 < Lbol <
4x10^46 erg s-1 are inferred. We compare model luminosities with those obtained
by integrating the observed SED, finding that the latter are lower by a factor
of ~2 in the median. The discrepancy can be as high as an order of magnitude
for models with high optical depth (tau_9.7um=10). The ratio between the
luminosities obtained by the fitting procedure and from the observed SED
suggest that, at least for Type~2 AGN, observed bolometric luminosities are
likely to underestimate intrinsic ones and the effect is more severe for highly
obscured sources. Bolometric corrections from the hard X-ray band are computed
and have a median value of k_2-10kev ~ 20. The obscured AGN in our sample are
characterized by relatively low Eddington ratios (median lambda_Edd~0.08). On
average, they are consistent with the Eddington ratio increasing at increasing
bolometric correction (e.g. Vasudevan & Fabiam 2009).

derive the abundances of stratospheric hydrocarbons; and (c) detect fluorescent
emission from CO at 4.7 $\mu$m. Methods: Mid-infrared spectra were modelled
using a line-by-line radiative transfer code to determine the temperature
structure between 1-1000 $\mu$bar and the abundances of CH$_4$, CH$_3$D and
higher-order hydrocarbons. A full non-LTE radiative model was then used to
determine the best fitting CO profile to reproduce the fluorescent emission
observed at 4.7 $\mu$m in the NG channel (with a spectral resolution of 135).
Results: The globally-averaged stratospheric temperature structure is
quasi-isothermal between 1-1000 $\mu$bar, which suggests little variation in
global stratospheric conditions since studies by the Infrared Space Observatory
a decade earlier. The derived CH$_4$ mole fraction of
$(9.0\pm3.0)\times10^{-4}$ at 50 mbar, decreasing to $(0.9\pm0.3)\times10^{-4}$
at 1 $\mu$bar, is larger than that expected if the tropopause at 56 K acts as
an efficient cold trap, but consistent with the hypothesis that CH$_4$ leaking
through the warm south polar tropopause (62-66 K) is globally redistributed by
stratospheric motion. The ratio of D/H in CH$_4$ of $3.0\pm1.0\times10^{-4}$
supports the conclusion that Neptune is enriched in deuterium relative to the
other giant planets. We determine a mole fraction of ethane of
$(8.5\pm2.1)\times10^{-7}$ at 0.3 mbar, consistent with previous studies, and a
mole fraction of ethylene of $5.0_{-2.1}^{+1.8}\times10^{-7}$ at 2.8 $\mu$bar.
An emission peak at 4.7 $\mu$m is interpreted as a fluorescent emission of CO,

response to gradients of signaling molecules. During fly development in early
Drosophila embryos, the Bicoid (Bcd) morphogen gradient is established within
the first hour after fertilization. Bcd acts as a transcription factor,
initiating the expression of a cascade of genes that determine the segmentation
pattern of the embryo, which serves as a blueprint for the future adult
organism. A robust understanding of the mechanisms that govern this
segmentation cascade is still lacking, and a new generation of quantitative
measurements of the spatio-temporal concentration dynamics of the individual
players of this cascade are necessary for further progress. Here we describe a
series of methods that are meant to represent a start of such a quantification
using Bcd as an example. We describe the generation of a transgenic fly line
expressing a Bcd-eGFP fusion protein, and we use this line to carefully analyze
the Bcd concentration dynamics and to measure absolute Bcd expression levels in
living fly embryos using two-photon microscopy. These experiments have proven

energy spectrum of traps in KCl and NaI crystals in the temperature range
80-500 K. It is shown that the thermal activation energies of traps in KCl and
NaI form one oscillatory series E=hwn with vibrational quantum energies of
0.121 eV in KCl and 0.061 eV in NaI. In this case, the quantum number n assumes
half-integer and integer values. Based on the generalized data on the
investigated alkali-halide crystals (AHC), we confirmed the earlier proposed
model of TL in AHCs. It is assumed that, in addition to the nonradiative H-F
recombination, there exists the two-stage recombination of H-centers at anion
vacancies resulting in the radiative recombination of a hole at an F-center.
The energy of a quantum in the oscillatory rule corresponds to a local
vibrational mode of an X2 halide molecule.

Maintaining real time operation will require a sustained performance of around

implementation, exploiting both the high computing density and FLOP-per-Watt

is huge, attempts to justify the model results using empirical data are
relatively rare. As linking to real data is essential for establishing model
credibility, this Letter develops a empirical confirmation experiment by which
an opinion model is related to real election data. The model is based on a
representation of opinions as a vector of $k$ bits. Individuals interact
according to the principle that similarity leads to interaction and interaction
leads to still more similarity. In the comparison to real data we concentrate
on the transient opinion profiles that form during the dynamic process. An
artificial election procedure is introduced which allows to relate transient
opinion configurations to the electoral performance of candidates for which
data is available. The election procedure based on the well--established
principle of proximity voting is repeatedly performed during the transient
period and remarkable statistical agreement with the empirical data is
observed.

discontinuous, hybrid transition at a higher threshold. Avalanches of

finally diverging at this threshold. We describe the existence of a special

Submitted to Applied Probability Trust.",,,,"q-fin.PR math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, a finite-state mean-reverting model for the short-rate, based
on the continuous time Ehrenfest process, will be examined. Two explicit
pricing formulae for zero-coupon bonds will be derived in the general and the
special symmetric cases. Its limiting relationship to the Vasicek model will be
examined with some numerical results.

matrices of the structural constants for this chain of evolution algebras
satisfies an analogue of Chapman-Kolmogorov equation. We give several examples
(time homogenous, time non-homogenous, periodic, etc.) of such chains. For a
periodic chain of evolution algebras we construct a continuum set of
non-isomorphic evolution algebras and show that the corresponding discrete time
chain of evolution algebras is dense in the set. We obtain a criteria for an
evolution algebra to be baric and give a concept of a property transition. For
several chains of evolution algebras we describe the behavior of the baric
property depending on the time. For a chain of evolution algebras given by the
matrix of a two-state evolution we define a baric property controller function
and under some conditions on this controller we prove that the chain is not
baric almost surely (with respect to Lebesgue measure). We also construct
examples of the almost surely baric chains of evolution algebras. We show that
there are chains of evolution algebras such that if it has a unique (resp.
infinitely many) absolute nilpotent element at a fixed time, then it has unique
(resp. infinitely many) absolute nilpotent element any time; also there are
chains of evolution algebras which have not such property. For an example of
two dimensional chain of evolution algebras we give the full set of idempotent
elements and show that for some values of parameters the number of idempotent
elements does not depend on time, but for other values of parameters there is a
critical time $t_{c}$ such that the chain has only two idempotent elements if
time $t\geq t_{\rm c}$ and it has four idempotent elements if time $t< t_{\rm
c}$

underlying models amended. The period between 2003 and 2008 should be described
by the dependence of the S&P 500 stock market index on real GDP because the
population pyramid was highly inaccurate. The 2008 trough and 2009 rally are
well predicted by the original model, however. The rally will end in
March/April 2010 and the S&P 500 level will be decreasing into 2011. This
prediction should validate the model.

invariant light field as light emerges from a set of periodic metallic
nano-objects. The underlying physical mechanism of generation of this unique
optical curtain can be explained in both the spatial domain and the wave-vector
domain. In particular, in each period we use one metallic nanostrip to equate
the amplitudes of lights impinging on the openings of two metallic nanoslits
and also shift their phases by pi difference. We elaborate the influence on the
output effect from some geometrical parameters like the periodicity, the slit
height and so on. By controlling the light illuminated on metallic
subwavelength apertures, it is practical to generate optical curtains of
arbitrary forms, which may open new routes of plasmonic nano-lithography.
