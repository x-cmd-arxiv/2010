and we need to take them into account. In particular, if the gaps are not
randomly distributed, they will produce a peak and a series of harmonics in the
periodogram that will destroy the stellar information. An interpolation of the
data can be good solution for this problem. In this paper we have studied an
interpolation method based on the so-called 'inpainting' algorithms. To check
the algorithm, we used both VIRGO and CoRoT satellite data to which we applied
a realistic artificial window of a real CoRoT observing run to introduce gaps.
Next we compared the results with the original, non-windowed data. Therefore,
we were able to optimize the algorithm by minimizing the difference between the
power spectrum density of the data with gaps and the complete time series. In
general, we find that the power spectrum of the inpainted time series is very
similar to the original, unperturbed one. Seismic inferences obtained after
interpolating the data are the same as in the original case.

normal star forming galaxies for a comparison of the dependence of
galaxy-averaged star formation rates on molecular gas masses at low and high
redshifts, and in different galactic environments. Although the current high-z
samples are still small and biased toward the luminous and massive tail of the
actively star-forming 'main-sequence', a fairly clear picture is emerging.
Independent of whether galaxy integrated quantities or surface densities are
considered, low- and high-z SFG galaxy populations appear to follow similar
molecular gas-star formation relations with slopes 1.1 to 1.2. The
gas-depletion time scale in these SFGs grows from 0.5 Gyrs at z~2 to 1.5 Gyrs
at z~0. Because star formation depletion times are significantly smaller than
the Hubble time at all redshifts sampled, star formation rates and gas
fractions are set by the balance between gas accretion from the halo and
stellar feedback. In contrast, very luminous gas rich major mergers at both
low-z and high-z produce on average 4 to10 times more far-infrared luminosity
per unit gas mass. Only some fraction of this difference can be explained by
uncertainties in gas-mass or luminosity estimators; much of it must be
intrinsic. The most likely interpretation is that the star formation relation
is driven by global dynamical effects. For a given mass, the more compact
merger systems produce stars more rapidly because their gas clouds are more
compressed with shorter dynamical times, so that they churn more quickly
through the available gas reservoir than the typical normal disk galaxies. When
the dependence on galactic dynamical time scale is explicitly included, disk
galaxies and mergers appear to follow similar gas to star-formation relations.
The mergers may be forming stars at slightly higher efficiencies than the
disks.

of Type I, II or heterotic string theories. Chiral fermions in four dimensions
are obtained by several mechanisms. Especially, the background flux is one of
the most interesting mechanisms for obtaining four dimensional chiral theories.
Chiral matter fields have localized wavefunctions on extra dimensions. We
discuss about the relations between background flux and low-energy spectra
which are counted by their zero-modes. Yukawa couplings are free parameters in
the standard model and may be related to the underlying physics. In the string
theory or its low-energy limit, they are determined by overlap integral of
wavefunctions on extra dimensions. We also study the higher order couplings
based on the field theoretical approach. From the analysis of generic n-point
couplings, we can discuss about flavor structures. We find that in such a
construction some discrete flavor symmetries appear in the four dimensional
effective theory. Their phenomenological implications are discussed.
Furthermore we extend these constructions to orbifold background. Magnetic flux
still plays an important role and leads to various types of low-energy spectra
different from that of toroidal compactifications. The orbifold models with

Non-local in time, it accounts for radiative visco-inertial effects and
non-radiative drag. It is completely determined by energy functions computed at
constant velocity. Various limits are examined, including that of vanishing
core width. Known results are retrieved as particular cases. Notably, the EoM

for 57 objects, most of which had no previous classification or a generic

almost 30 luminous early-B supergiants and a number of less luminous late-O
supergiants. In addition, we find a few mid B supergiants with very high
luminosity, some of them displaying signs of heavy mass loss. All these stars
form a sequence compatible with theoretical evolutionary tracks. In addition,
two early B supergiants also show indication of heavy mass loss and may
represent the evolutionary phase immediately prior to the Wolf-Rayet stage. We
investigate cluster properties using the spectral types and existing
photometry. We find that the reddening law to the cluster does not deviate
strongly from standard, even though extinction is quite variable, with an
average value A_v=10.8. Though evolutionary tracks for high-mass stars are
subject to large uncertainties, our data support an age of >~5Myr and a

some new meta-stable baryons may appear near the TeV region. Therefore, a
twofold standard model diagram is proposed, and involves some experiment
phenomena: The new meta-stable baryons' decays produce delta particles, which
are helpful in explaining the Dijet asymmetry phenomena at LHC of CERN, the
different results for the Fermilab's data peak, etc; However, according to the
(B-L) invariance, the sterile ""neutrino"" about the event excess in MiniBooNe is
not the fourth neutrino but rather the delta particle; We think that the delta
particles are related to the phenomenon about neutrinos FTL, and that
anti-neutrinos are faster than neutrinos. FTL is also related to cosmic
inflation, singular point disappearance, a finite universe, and abnormal red
shift of SN Ia. Besides, the dark matter particles with low mass are helpful in
explaining missing solar neutrinos, the CMB angular power spectrum measured by
WMAP etc. Some experiments and observations are suggested, especially about the

mechanics, with special emphasis on the view's outer edges---dubbed QBism.
QBism has its roots in personalist Bayesian probability theory, is crucially
dependent upon the tools of quantum information theory, and most recently, has
set out to investigate whether the physical world might be of a type sketched
by some false-started philosophies of 100 years ago (pragmatism, pluralism,
nonreductionism, and meliorism). Beyond conceptual issues, work at Perimeter
Institute is focused on the hard technical problem of finding a good
representation of quantum mechanics purely in terms of probabilities, without
amplitudes or Hilbert-space operators. The best candidate representation
involves a mysterious entity called a symmetric informationally complete
quantum measurement. Contemplation of it gives a way of thinking of the Born
Rule as an addition to the rules of probability theory, applicable when an
agent considers gambling on the consequences of his interactions with a newly
recognized universal capacity: dimension (formerly Hilbert-space dimension).
(The word ""capacity"" should conjure up an image of something like gravitational
mass---a body's mass measures its capacity to attract other bodies. With
hindsight one can say that the founders of quantum mechanics discovered another
universal capacity, ""dimension."") The article ends by showing that the
egocentric elements in QBism represent no impediment to pursuing quantum
cosmology and outlining some directions for future work.

for the analysis of stellar population spectra. They are most accurately
modelled through empirical calibrations of absorption line indices with the
stellar parameters effective temperature, metallicity, and surface gravity, the
so-called fitting functions. Here we present new empirical fitting functions
for the 25 optical Lick absorption line indices based on the new stellar
library MILES. The major improvements with respect to the Lick/IDS library are
the better sampling of stellar parameter space, a generally higher signal-
to-noise, and a careful flux calibration. In fact we find that errors on
individual index measurements in MILES are considerably smaller than in
Lick/IDS. Instead we find the rms of the residuals between the final fitting
functions and the data to be dominated by errors in the stellar parameters. We
provide fitting functions for both Lick/IDS and MILES spectral resolutions, and
compare our results with other fitting functions in the literature. A Fortran
90 code is available online in order to simplify the implementation in stellar
population models. We further calculate the offsets in index measurements
between the Lick/IDS system to a flux calibrated system. For this purpose we
use the three libraries MILES, ELODIE, and STELIB. We find that offsets are
negligible in some cases, most notably for the widely used indices Hbeta, Mgb,
Fe5270, and Fe5335. In a number of cases, however, the difference between flux
calibrated library and Lick/IDS is significant with the offsets depending on
index strengths. Interestingly, there is no general agreement between the three
libraries for a large number of indices, which hampers the derivation of a
universal offset between the Lick/IDS and flux calibrated systems.

QSOs at z~2. Lower redshift, z~1, analogues of the distant IRX population are
identified by firstly redshifting to z=2 the SEDs of all sources with secure
spectroscopic redshifts in the AEGIS (6488) and the GOODS-North (1784) surveys
and then selecting those that qualify as IRX sources at that redshift. A total
of 19 galaxies are selected. The mean redshift of the sample is $z\approx1$. We
do not find strong evidence for Compton Thick QSOs in the sample. For 9 sources
with X-ray counterparts, the X-ray spectra are consistent with Compton Thin
AGN. Only 3 of them show tentative evidence for Compton Thick obscuration. The
SEDs of the X-ray undetected population are consistent with starburst activity.
There is no evidence for a hot dust component at the mid-infrared associated
with AGN heated dust. If the X-ray undetected sources host AGN, an upper limit
of L_X(2-10keV) =1e43erg/s is estimated for their intrinsic luminosity. We
propose that a large fraction of the $z\approx2$ IRX population are not Compton
Thick QSOs but low luminosity [L_X(2-10keV)<1e43erg/s], possibly Compton Thin,
AGN or dusty starbursts. It is shown that the decomposition of the AGN and
starburst contribution to the mid-IR is essential for interpreting the nature
of this population, as star-formation may dominate this wavelength regime.

within 'quasistars' (QSs), accreting black holes embedded within massive
hydrostatic gaseous envelopes. These structures could form if the infall of gas
into the center of a halo exceeds about 1 solar mass per year. We use a
merger-tree approach to estimate the rate at which QSs might form as a function
of redshift, and the statistical properties of the resulting QS and seed black
hole populations. We relate the triggering of runaway infall to major mergers
of gas-rich galaxies, and to a threshold for global gravitational instability,
which we link to the angular momentum of the host. This is the main parameter
of our models. Once infall is triggered, its rate is determined by the halo
potential; the properties of the resulting QS and seed black hole depend on
this rate. After the epoch of QSs, we model the growth of MBHs within their
hosts in a merger-driven accretion scenario. We compare MBH seeds grown inside
quasistars to a seed model that derives from the remnants of the first
metal-free stars, and also study the case in which both channels of MBH
formation operate simultaneously. We find that a limited range of QS/MBH
formation efficiencies exists that allows one to reproduce observational
constraints. Our models match the density of z = 6 quasars, the cumulative mass
density accreted onto MBHs (according to Soltan's argument), and the current
mass density of MBHs. The mass function of QSs peaks at mass ~ 1e6 solar
masses, and we calculate the number counts for the JWST in the 2-10 micron

from physical intuition and computer simulation, and the exploitation of
rigorous mathematical methods, the main features of the mean field
Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass model have been firmly established. In
particular, it has been possible to prove the existence and uniqueness of the
infinite volume limit for the free energy, and its Parisi expression, in terms
of a variational principle, involving a functional order parameter. Even the
expected property of ultrametricity, for the infinite volume states, seems to
be near to a complete proof. The main structural feature of this model, and
related models, is the deep phenomenon of spontaneous replica symmetry breaking
(RSB), discovered by Parisi many years ago. By expanding on our previous work,
the aim of this paper is to investigate a general frame, where replica symmetry
breaking is embedded in a kind of mechanical scheme of the Hamilton-Jacobi
type. Here, the analog of the ""time"" variable is a parameter characterizing the
strength of the interaction, while the ""space"" variables rule out
quantitatively the broken replica symmetry pattern. Starting from the simple
cases, where annealing is assumed, or replica symmetry, we build up a
progression of dynamical systems, with an increasing number of space variables,
which allow to weaken the effect of the potential in the Hamilton-Jacobi
equation, as the level of symmetry braking is increased. This new machinery
allows to work out mechanically the general K-step RSB solutions, in a
different interpretation with respect to the replica trick, and lightens easily
their properties as existence or uniqueness.

formulated for wireless fading networks, where the nodes are allowed to perform
network coding. The aim is to jointly optimize end-to-end transport layer
rates, network code design variables, broadcast link flows, link capacities,
average power consumption, and short-term power allocation policies. As in the
routing paradigm where nodes simply forward packets, the cross-layer
optimization problem with network coding is non-convex in general. It is proved
however, that with network coding, dual decomposition for multicast is optimal
so long as the fading at each wireless link is a continuous random variable.
This lends itself to provably convergent subgradient algorithms, which not only
admit a layered-architecture interpretation but also optimally integrate
network coding in the protocol stack. The dual algorithm is also paired with a
scheme that yields near-optimal network design variables, namely multicast
end-to-end rates, network code design quantities, flows over the broadcast
links, link capacities, and average power consumption. Finally, an asynchronous
subgradient method is developed, whereby the dual updates at the physical layer
can be affordably performed with a certain delay with respect to the resource
allocation tasks in upper layers. This attractive feature is motivated by the
complexity of the physical layer subproblem, and is an adaptation of the
subgradient method suitable for network control.

resolution enable us for the first time to look directly into the detailed
spatial structure and properties of the dust in these systems. The images of
NGC 185 at 8 and 24 micron display a mixed morphology characterized by a
shell-like diffuse emission region surrounding a central concentration of more
intense infrared emission. The lower resolution images at longer wavelengths
show the same spatial distribution within the central 50"" but beyond this
radius, the 160 micron emission is more extended than that at 24 and 70micron.
On the other hand, the dwarf galaxy NGC 147 located only a small distance away
from NGC 185 shows no significant infrared emission beyond 24 micron and
therefore its diffuse infrared emission is mainly stellar in origin. For NGC
185, the derived dust mass based on the best fit to the spectral energy
distribution is 1.9e3 Msol, implying a gas mass of ~3.0e5 Msol. These values
are in agreement with those previously estimated from infrared as well as from
CO and HI observations and are consistent with the predicted mass return from
dying stars based on the last burst of star formation ~1.0e9 yr ago. Based on
the 70 to 160micron flux density ratio, we estimate a temperature for the dust
of ~17K. For NGC 147, we obtain an upper limit for the dust mass of 4.5e2 Msol

previous upper limit derived using ISO observations of this galaxy. In the case

the redshift range 3<z<7. Combined with earlier Keck and published ESO VLT
data, our sample contains more than 600 dropouts, offering new insight into the
nature of sub-L* sources typical of those likely to dominate the cosmic
reionisation process. Here we use this sample to characterise the fraction of
strong Lya emitters within the continuum-selected dropouts. By quantifying how
the ""Lya fraction"" varies with redshift, we seek to constrain changes in Lya
transmission associated with reionisation. In order to distinguish the effects
of reionisation from other factors which affect the Lya fraction (e.g. dust,
ISM kinematics), we study the luminosity and redshift-dependence of the Lya
fraction over 3<z<6, when the IGM is known to be ionised. These results reveal
that low luminosity galaxies show strong Lya emission much more frequently than
luminous systems, and that at fixed luminosity, the prevalence of strong Lya
emission increases moderately with redshift over 3 < z < 6. Based on the
correlation between blue UV slopes and strong Lya emitting galaxies in our
dataset, we argue that the Lya fraction trends are governed by redshift and
luminosity-dependent variations in the dust obscuration, with likely additional
contributions from trends in the kinematics and covering fraction of neutral
hydrogen. We find a tentative decrease in the Lya fraction at z~7 based on the
limited IR spectra for candidate z~7 lensed LBGs, a result which, if confirmed
with future surveys, would suggest an increase in the neutral fraction by this
epoch. Given the supply of z and Y-drops now available from Hubble WFC3/IR
surveys, we show it will soon be possible to significantly improve estimates of
the Lya fraction using optical and near-IR spectrographs, thereby extending the
study conducted in this paper to 7<z<8.

Galerkin formulation for both anisotropic and isotropic diffusion with decay
does not respect the maximum principle.
  We first show that the numerical accuracy of the classical Galerkin
formulation deteriorates dramatically with increase in the decay coefficient
for isotropic medium and violates the discrete maximum principle. However, in
the case of isotropic medium, the extent of violation decreases with mesh
refinement. We then show that, in the case of anisotropic medium, the classical
Galerkin formulation for anisotropic diffusion with decay violates the discrete
maximum principle even at lower values of decay coefficient and does not vanish
with mesh refinement. We then present a methodology for enforcing maximum

Representative numerical results (which take into account anisotropy and

spectroscopy with the scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to examine the novel
electronic states that emerge from the uranium f states in URu2Si2. We find
that as the temperature is lowered, partial screening of the f electrons' spins
gives rise to a spatially modulated Kondo-Fano resonance that is maximal
between the surface U atoms. At T=17.5 K, URu2Si2 is known to undergo a 2nd
order phase transition from the Kondo lattice state into a phase with a hidden
order parameter. From tunneling spectroscopy, we identify a spatially
modulated, bias-asymmetric energy gap with a mean-field temperature dependence
that develops in the hidden order state. Spectroscopic imaging further reveals
a spatial correlation between the hidden order gap and the Kondo resonance,
suggesting that the two phenomena involve the same electronic states.

oscillations (MMOs) consisting of periods of small amplitude oscillations
interspersed with spikes. Various models with different underlying mechanisms
have been proposed to generate this type of behavior. Stochastic versions of
these models can produce similarly looking time series, often with noise-driven
mechanisms different from those of the deterministic models. We present a suite
of measures which, when applied to the time series, serves to distinguish
models and classify routes to producing MMOs, such as noise-induced
oscillations or delay bifurcation. By focusing on the subthreshold
oscillations, we analyze the interspike interval density, trends in the
amplitude and a coherence measure. We develop these measures on a biophysical
model for stellate cells and a phenomenological FitzHugh-Nagumo-type model and
apply them on related models. The analysis highlights the influence of model
parameters and reset and return mechanisms in the context of a novel approach
using noise level to distinguish model types and MMO mechanisms. Ultimately, we
indicate how the suite of measures can be applied to experimental time series
to reveal the underlying dynamical structure, while exploiting either the
intrinsic noise of the system or tunable extrinsic noise.

particularly to the interstellar medium and the loss of magnetic flux from
collapsing molecular cloud cores. Our system is a weakly ionized plasma in
which neutral and charged particles can be converted into each other through
nuclear beta decays (or ionization-recombination processes). In the
""weak-coupling"" limit of infrequent inter-particle interactions, the evolution
of the magnetic field is controlled by the beta decay rate and can be described
by a non-linear partial integro-differential equation. In the opposite,
""strong-coupling"" regime, the evolution is controlled by the inter-particle
collisions and can be modelled through a non-linear diffusion equation. We show
numerically that, in both regimes, ambipolar diffusion tends to spread out the
magnetic flux, but, contrary to the normal Ohmic diffusion, it produces sharp
magnetic field gradients with associated current sheets around those regions

  Proceedings of ICOSAHOM '09",,,,"math.NA physics.geo-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  When a function $f(x)$ is singular at a point $x_{s}$ on the real axis, its
Fourier series, when truncated at the $N$-th term, gives a pointwise error of
only $O(1/N)$ over the entire real axis. Such singularities spontaneously arise
as ""fronts"" in meteorology and oceanography and ""shocks"" in other branches of
fluid mechanics. It has been previously shown that it is possible to recover an
exponential rate of convegence at all points away from the singularity in the
sense that $|f(x) - f_{N}^{\sigma}(x) | \sim O(\exp(- q(x) N))$ where
$f_{N}^{\sigma}(x)$ is the result of applying a filter or summability method to
the partial sum $f_{N}(x)$ and $q(x)$ is a proportionality constant that is a
function of $d(x) \equiv |x-x_{s}|$, the distance from $x$ to the singularity.
Here we give an elementary proof of great generality using conformal mapping in
a dummy variable $z$; this is equivalent to applying the Euler acceleration. We
show that $q(x) \approx \log(\cos(d(x)/2))$ for the Euler filter when the
Fourier period is $2 \pi$. More sophisticated filters can increase $q(x)$, but
the Euler filter is simplest. We can also correct recently published claims
that only a root-exponential rate of convergence can be recovered for filters
of compact support such as the Euler acceleration and the Erfc-Log filter.

be rewritten in terms of the topological string amplitudes providing evidence
for the conjecture, we needed a novel idea in the context of Wilson loop
observables to extract cross-cap $c=0,1,2$ topological amplitudes. Recent paper
of Marino based on the work of Morton and Ryder has clearly shown that the
composite representation placed on the knots and links plays a crucial role to
rewrite the topological string cross-cap $c=0$ amplitude. This enables
extracting the unoriented cross-cap $c=2$ topological amplitude. In this paper,
we have explicitly worked out the composite invariants for some framed knots
and links carrying composite representations in U(N) Chern-Simons theory. We
have verified generalised Rudolph's theorem, which relates composite invariants
to the invariants in SO(N) Chern-Simons theory, and also verified Marino's

remains long-ranged because of the gauge invariance. Another important
consequence of impurity scattering is that the fermions have a finite damping
rate, which reduces their lifetime staying in a definite quantum state. By

decision-making under uncertainty, such as in meta-reasoning for search; in
selecting measurements to make, prior to choosing a course of action; and in
managing the exploration vs. exploitation tradeoff. Since such applications
typically require numerous VOI computations during a single run, it is
essential that VOI be computed efficiently. We examine the issue of anytime
estimation of VOI, as frequently it suffices to get a crude estimate of the
VOI, thus saving considerable computational resources. As a case study, we
examine VOI estimation in the measurement selection problem. Empirical
evaluation of the proposed scheme in this domain shows that computational
resources can indeed be significantly reduced, at little cost in expected
rewards achieved in the overall decision problem.

paradox is why Notfors and Godfrey's approximate time log-stretched DMO can
produce better impulse responses than the full log DMO, and why Hale's f-k DMO
is correct although it was based on two inaccurate assumptions for the midpoint
repositioning and the DMO time relationship? Based on the asymptotic analysis
of the DMO algorithms, we find that any form of correctly formulated DMO must
handle both space and time coordinates properly in order to deal with all dips
accurately. The surprising improvement of Notfors and Godfrey's log DMO on Bale
and Jakubowicz's full log DMO was due to the equivalent midpoint repositioning
by transforming the time-related phase shift to the space-related phase shift.
The explanation of why Hale's f-k DMO is correct although it was based on two
inaccurate assumptions is that the two approximations exactly cancel each other
in the f-k domain to give the correct final result.

form a promoting temperature gradient and trigger transition to detonation.
First, we investigate the effect of radiation preheating of the unburnt
mixtures, when they are traveling through the wrinkles on the flame surface, in
order to estimate a possibility of significant temperature rise. Subsequently,
numerical simulations of a simplified mathematical model are carried out. They
demonstrate plausibility of the proposed mechanism of the deflagration to
detonation transition.
