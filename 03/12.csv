coupled atomic ensembles, based on a recently proposed collective encoding
strategy. Rydberg-blockade mediated two-qubit gates and efficient cooperative
photon emission are employed to create ensemble-photon entanglement. Thanks to
deterministic entanglement swapping operations via Rydberg-based two-qubit
gates, and to the suppression of multi-excitation errors by the blockade
effect, the entanglement distribution rate of the present scheme is higher by
orders of magnitude than the rates achieved by other ensemble-based repeaters.
We also show how to realize temporal multiplexing with this system, which
offers an additional speedup in entanglement distribution.

set $E(G)$. A $k$-dimensional box is a Cartesian product of closed intervals
$[a_1,b_1]\times [a_2,b_2]\times...\times [a_k,b_k]$. The {\it boxicity} of
$G$, $\boxi(G)$ is the minimum integer $k$ such that $G$ can be represented as
the intersection graph of $k$-dimensional boxes, i.e. each vertex is mapped to
a $k$-dimensional box and two vertices are adjacent in $G$ if and only if their
corresponding boxes intersect. Let $\poset=(S,P)$ be a poset where $S$ is the
ground set and $P$ is a reflexive, anti-symmetric and transitive binary
relation on $S$. The dimension of $\poset$, $\dim(\poset)$ is the minimum
integer $t$ such that $P$ can be expressed as the intersection of $t$ total
orders. Let $G_\poset$ be the \emph{underlying comparability graph} of
$\poset$, i.e. $S$ is the vertex set and two vertices are adjacent if and only
if they are comparable in $\poset$. It is a well-known fact that posets with
the same underlying comparability graph have the same dimension. The first
result of this paper links the dimension of a poset to the boxicity of its
underlying comparability graph. In particular, we show that for any poset
$\poset$, $\boxi(G_\poset)/(\chi(G_\poset)-1) \le \dim(\poset)\le
2\boxi(G_\poset)$, where $\chi(G_\poset)$ is the chromatic number of $G_\poset$
and $\chi(G_\poset)\ne1$. It immediately follows that if $\poset$ is a height-2
poset, then $\boxi(G_\poset)\le \dim(\poset)\le 2\boxi(G_\poset)$ since the
underlying comparability graph of a height-2 poset is a bipartite graph. The
second result of the paper relates the boxicity of a graph $G$ with a natural
partial order associated with the \emph{extended double cover} of $G$, denoted
as $G_c$: Note that $G_c$ is a bipartite graph with partite sets $A$ and $B$
which are copies of $V(G)$ such that corresponding to every $u\in V(G)$, there
are two vertices $u_A\in A$ and $u_B\in B$ and $\{u_A,v_B\}$ is an edge in
$G_c$ if and only if either $u=v$ or $u$ is adjacent to $v$ in $G$. Let
$\poset_c$ be the natural height-2 poset associated with $G_c$ by making $A$
the set of minimal elements and $B$ the set of maximal elements. We show that
$\frac{\boxi(G)}{2} \le \dim(\poset_c) \le 2\boxi(G)+4$. These results have
some immediate and significant consequences. The upper bound $\dim(\poset)\le
2\boxi(G_\poset)$ allows us to derive hitherto unknown upper bounds for poset
dimension such as $\dim(\poset)\le 2\tw(G_\poset)+4$, since boxicity of any
graph is known to be at most its $\tw+2$. In the other direction, using the
already known bounds for partial order dimension we get the following: (1) The
boxicity of any graph with maximum degree $\Delta$ is $O(\Delta\log^2\Delta)$
which is an improvement over the best known upper bound of $\Delta^2+2$. (2)
There exist graphs with boxicity $\Omega(\Delta\log\Delta)$. This disproves a
conjecture that the boxicity of a graph is $O(\Delta)$. (3) There exists no
polynomial-time algorithm to approximate the boxicity of a bipartite graph on
$n$ vertices with a factor of $O(n^{0.5-\epsilon})$ for any $\epsilon>0$,
unless $NP=ZPP$.

population dynamics in particular to some properties of the multi-step from
healthy tissue to fully malignant tumours. Recent evidence shows that diversity
within the cell population of a neoplasm, a pre-tumoural lession that can
develop into a fully malignant tumour, is the best predictor for its evolving
into a tumour. By studying the dynamics of a population described by a
multi-type, population-size limited branching process in terms of the
evolutionary formalism, we show some general principles regarding the
probability of a resident population to being invaded by a mutant population in
terms of the number of types present in the population and their resilience. We
show that, although diversity in the mutant population poses a barrier for the
emergence of the initial (benign) lession, under appropiate conditions, namely,
the phenotypes in the mutant population being more resilient than those of the
resident population, a more variable noeplastic population is more likely to be
invaded by a more malignant one. Analysis of a model of gene regulatory
networks suggest possible mechanisms giving rise to mutants with increased
phenotypic diversity and robustness. We then go on to show how these results
may help us to interpret some recent data regarding the evolution of Barrett's
oesophagus into throat cancer.

bond-dimerization even when the charge density in the orbitals forming the
one-dimensional band is significantly smaller than 1. In contrast, for carrier
density of half an electron per atom the Peierls instability is absent within

interferometry, particularly suited for the detection of weak sources close to
the sensitivity limits of the interferometers. However, effects from a changing
atmosphere and inaccuracies in the correlator model may affect the
phase-referenced images, leading to wrong estimates of source flux densities
and positions. A systematic observational study of signal decoherence in phase
referencing, and its effects in the image plane, has not been performed yet.
  Aims: We systematically studied how the signal coherence in
Very-Long-Baseline-Interferometry (VLBI) observations is affected by a
phase-reference calibration at different frequencies and for different
calibrator-to-target separations. The results obtained should be of interest
for a correct interpretation of many phase-referenced observations with VLBI.
  Methods: We observed a set of 13 strong sources (the S5 polar cap sample) at
8.4 and 15 GHz in phase-reference mode, with 32 different calibrator/target
combinations spanning angular separations between 1.5 and 20.5 degrees. We
obtained phase-referenced images and studied how the dynamic range and peak
flux density depend on observing frequency and source separation.
  Results: We obtained dynamic ranges and peak flux densities of the
phase-referenced images as a function of frequency and separation from the
calibrator. We compared our results with models and phenomenological equations
previously reported.
  Conclusions: The dynamic range of the phase-referenced images is strongly
limited by the atmosphere at all frequencies and for all source separations.
The limiting dynamic range is inversely proportional to the sine of the
calibrator-to-target separation. We also find that the peak flux densities,
relative to those obtained with the self-calibrated images, decrease with
source separation.

sources with integrated intensities Ic ~(5-9)sigma. The CO detected sources
have a variety of mid-IR spectra, including strong PAH, deep silicate
absorption and power-law continuum, implying that these molecular gas rich
objects at z~2 could be either starbursts or dust obscured AGNs. The measured
line luminosity L'[CO] is (1.28-3.77)e+10[K km/s pc^2]. The averaged molecular
gas mass M(H2) is 1.7e+10Msun, assuming CO-to-H2 conversion factor of
0.8Msun/[K km/s pc^2]. Three sources (33%) -- MIPS506, MIPS16144 & MIPS8342 --

MIPS16144 show spatial separations of 45kpc and 10.9kpc, allowing the estimates

respectively. The implied gas fraction, M(gas)/M(dyn), is 3% and 4%, assuming
an average inclination angle. Finally, the analysis of the HST/NIC2 images,
mid-IR spectra and IR SED revealed that most of our sources are mergers,
containing dust obscured AGNs dominating the luminosities at (3-6)um. Together,
these results provide some evidence suggesting SMGs, bright 24um z~2 ULIRGs and

considered, where there exists a transmitter equipped with multiple antennas, a
legitimate receiver and an eavesdropper each equipped with a single antenna. We
study the problem of finding the optimal input covariance that achieves ergodic
secrecy capacity subject to a power constraint where only statistical
information about the eavesdropper channel is available at the transmitter.
This is a non-convex optimization problem that is in general difficult to
solve. Existing results address the case in which the eavesdropper or/and
legitimate channels have independent and identically distributed Gaussian
entries with zero-mean and unit-variance, i.e., the channels have trivial
covariances. This paper addresses the general case where eavesdropper and
legitimate channels have nontrivial covariances. A set of equations describing
the optimal input covariance matrix are proposed along with an algorithm to
obtain the solution. Based on this framework, we show that when full
information on the legitimate channel is available to the transmitter, the
optimal input covariance has always rank one. We also show that when only
statistical information on the legitimate channel is available to the
transmitter, the legitimate channel has some general non-trivial covariance,
and the eavesdropper channel has trivial covariance, the optimal input
covariance has the same eigenvectors as the legitimate channel covariance.
Numerical results are presented to illustrate the algorithm.

at its most fundamental level, where individual atoms are coupled to single
photons stored in three-dimensional cavities. This unique possibility to
experimentally explore the foundations of quantum physics has greatly evolved
with the advent of circuit QED, where on-chip superconducting qubits and
oscillators play the roles of two-level atoms and cavities, respectively. In
the strong coupling limit, atom and cavity can exchange a photon frequently
before coherence is lost. This important regime has been reached both in cavity
and circuit QED, but the design flexibility and engineering potential of the
latter allowed for increasing the ratio between the atom-cavity coupling rate
and the cavity transition frequency above the percent level. While these
experiments are well described by the renowned Jaynes-Cummings model, novel
physics is expected in the ultrastrong coupling limit. Here, we report on the
first experimental realization of a superconducting circuit QED system in the

understanding of reality which is based on our intuition in a classical world.
Nevertheless, it has often been tried to impose this understanding of reality
on quantum theory - with limited success. Instead, it might be a better
alternative to redefine the meaning of physical reality. This is the objective
of the paper. A consideration of the quantum measurement process, conditional
probabilities and some well-known typical quantum physical experiments provides
the reasoning for the following three hypotheses: (1) Prior to a first
measurement, a physical system is not in a quantum state. (2) Physical reality
is all that and only that about which (classical) information is available in
the universe. (3) Information creation is an independent process and is not
covered by the Schroedinger equation. It is the first step of the quantum
measurement process and does not have a classical counterpart. The first
hypothesis makes sense only if the quantum measurement process can be described
without presupposing an initial state for the system under consideration. This
becomes possible by the objective conditional probabilities which represent the
transition probabilities between the outcomes of successive quantum
measurements and have been introduced by the author in some recent papers. The
second hypothesis holds as well in the classical case, but a certain
incompleteness of reality is typical of quantum mechanics and the origin of
many quantum phenomena. Classically, the existence of a complete reality is
presumed, and hypothesis 3 has no meaning then.

Deviating this alignment affects the predictions for the neutrino oscillation
and neutrino mass observables. An attempt is made to classify the plethora of

Of these models, two particularly popular examples have been analyzed for
deviations from tribimaximal mixing by perturbing the vacuum expectation value
alignments. The effect of perturbations on the mixing angle observables is
studied. However, it is only investigation of the mass-related observables (the
effective mass for neutrinoless double beta decay and the sum of masses from
cosmology) that can lead to the exclusion of particular models by constraints
from future data, which indicates the importance of neutrino mass in
disentangling models. The models have also been tested for fine-tuning of the

additional scalars, which transform as representations of A_4 not included in

Our goal is to reproduce typical C IV line profiles observed in BAL quasars and
to identify the parameters governing the line profiles. The two-component wind
model appears to be efficient in reproducing the BAL profiles from the P
Cygni-type profiles to the more complex ones. Some profiles can also be

thousands of genes without hypothesizing that any specific gene is responsible

of possible factors (e.g. genes) in order to identify a small number that will
be considered in follow-up studies that tend to be more thorough and on smaller
scales. For large-scale studies, we propose a nonparametric Bayesian approach
based on random partition models. Our model thus divides the set of candidate
factors into several subgroups according to their degrees of relevance, or
potential effect, in relation to the outcome of interest. The model allows for
a latent rank to be assigned to each factor according to the overall potential
importance of its corresponding group. The posterior expectation or mode of
these ranks is used to set up a threshold for selecting potentially relevant
factors. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that our approach could be quite
effective in finding relevant genes compared to several alternative methods. We

show for the first time how these terms can be canceled out, allowing
analytical expressions for the beam shape coefficients to be found for a

expressions are found for Bessel beams and the modes of rectangular and

significant fraction of a precessional cycle of its jet axis. The components of
the prominent stationary H-alpha and H-beta lines are mainly identified as
arising from three emitting regions: (i) a super-Eddington accretion disc wind,
in the form of a broad component accounting for most of the mass loss from the
system, (ii) a circumbinary disc of material that we presume is being excreted
through the binary's L2 point, and (iii) the accretion disc itself as two
remarkably persistent components. The accretion disc components move with a
Keplerian velocity of ~600 km/s in the outer region of the disc. A direct
result of this decomposition is the determination of the accretion disc size,
whose outer radius attains ~8 R_sun in the case of Keplerian orbits around a
black hole mass of 10 M_sun. We determine an upper limit for the accretion disc
inner to outer radius ratio in SS433, R_in/R_out ~ 0.2, independent of the mass
of the compact object. The Balmer decrements, H-alpha/H-beta, are extracted
from the appropriate stationary emission lines for each component of the
system. The physical parameters of the gaseous components are derived. The
circumbinary ring decrement seems to be quite constant throughout precessional
phase, implying a constant electron density of log N_e(cm^-3) ~ 11.5 for the
circumbinary disc. The accretion disc wind shows a larger change in its
decrements exhibiting a clear dependence on precessional phase, implying a
sinusoid variation in its electron density log N_e(cm^-3) along our
line-of-sight between 10 and 13. This dependence of density on direction
suggests that the accretion disc wind is polloidal in nature.

frustrated. We analyze a lattice gas model of CO within mean field theory and

show that the assumption of a continuous phase transition at which CO or SO
develops implies that both CO and SO are incommensurate. To explain how
ferroelectric fluctuations in the charge disordered phase can be consistent
with an antiferroelectric ordered phase, we invoke an electron-phonon
interaction in which a low energy (20meV) zone-center transverse phonon plays a
key role. The energies of all the zone-center phonons are calculated from first
principles. We give a Landau analysis which explains SO and we discuss a model
of interactions which stabilizes the SO state, if it is assumed commensurate.
However, we suggest a high resolution experimental determination to see whether
this phase is really commensurate, as believed up to now. The applicability of
representation analysis is discussed. A tentative explanation for the

The AGN jet inflates cavities that become buoyantly unstable and rise up out of

originate multiple pairs of bubbles. For the physical conditions in the Perseus
cluster, multiple pairs of bubbles are obtained for a jet precession opening
angle > 40 degrees acting for at least three precession periods, reproducing
well both radio and X-ray maps. Based on such conditions, assuming that the

depends sensitively on primordial non-Gaussianity of the local form. In this
paper we point out that the strong scale dependence of the non-Gaussian halo
bias imprints a distinct signature on the covariance of cluster counts. We find
that using the full covariance of cluster counts results in improvements on
constraints on the non-Gaussian parameter f_NL of three (one) orders of
magnitude relative to cluster counts (counts + clustering variance) constraints
alone. We forecast f_NL constraints for the upcoming Dark Energy Survey in the
presence of uncertainties in the mass-observable relation, halo bias, and
photometric redshifts. We find that the DES can yield constraints on
non-Gaussianity of sigma(f_NL) ~ 1-5 even for relatively conservative
assumptions regarding systematics. Excess of correlations of cluster counts on
scales of hundreds of megaparsecs would represent a smoking gun signature of
primordial non-Gaussianity of the local type.

offer evidence that it is a super-Chandrasekhar mass (SC) SN Ia and thus had a
SC white dwarf (WD) progenitor. Optical spectra of SN 2007if, a similar object,
are also shown. SN 2009dc had one of the most slowly evolving light curves ever
observed for a SN Ia, with a rise time of ~23 days and Delta m_15(B) = 0.72
mag. We calculate a lower limit to the peak bolometric luminosity of ~2.4e43
erg/s, though the actual value is likely almost 40% larger. Optical spectra of
SN 2009dc and SN 2007if obtained near maximum brightness exhibit strong C II
features (indicative of a significant amount of unburned material), and the
post-maximum spectra are dominated by iron-group elements. All of our spectra
of SN 2009dc and SN 2007if also show low expansion velocities. However, we see
no strong evidence in SN 2009dc for a velocity ""plateau"" near maximum light
like the one seen in SN 2007if (Scalzo et al. 2010). The high luminosity and
low expansion velocities of SN 2009dc lead us to derive a possible WD
progenitor mass of more than 2 M_Sun and a Ni-56 mass of about 1.4-1.7 M_Sun.
We propose that the host galaxy of SN 2009dc underwent a gravitational
interaction with a neighboring galaxy in the relatively recent past. This may
have led to a sudden burst of star formation which could have produced the SC
WD progenitor of SN 2009dc and likely turned the neighboring galaxy into a
""post-starburst galaxy."" No published model seems to match the extreme values
observed in SN 2009dc, but simulations do show that such massive progenitors
can exist (likely as a result of the merger of two WDs) and can possibly
explode as SC SNe Ia.

investigation of the effect of varying relative planetary inclinations, up to
and including completely retrograde systems. We find that planets in low order
(E.g. 2:1) mean-motion resonances (MMRs) retain approximately constant TTV
amplitudes for $0<\,^{\circ}i<170\,^{\circ}$, only reducing in amplitude for $i
> 170\,^{\circ}$. Systems in higher order MMRs (E.g. 5:1) increase in TTV
amplitude as inclinations increase towards $45\,^{\circ}$, becoming
approximately constant for $45 < i < 135$, and then declining for $i >
135\,^{\circ}$. Planets away from resonance slowly decrease in TTV amplitude as
inclinations increase from 0 to 180, where-as planets adjacent to resonances
can exhibit a huge range of variability in TTV amplitude as a function of both
eccentricity and inclination. For highly retrograde systems ($135\,^{\circ} < i
\leq 180\,^{\circ}$), TTV signals will be undetectable across almost the
entirety of parameter space, with the exceptions occurring when the perturber
has high eccentricity or is very close to a MMR. This high inclination decrease
in TTV amplitude (on and away from resonance) is important for the analysis of
the known retrograde and multi-planet transiting systems, as inclination
effects need to be considered if TTVs are to be used to exclude the presence of
any putative planetary companions: absence of evidence is not evidence of
absence.

neutrinos results in a (non-linear) scale-dependent suppression of power
spectrum of the total matter distribution at scales probed by Lyman-alpha
forest data which is larger than the linear theory prediction by about 25% and
strongly redshift dependent. By extracting a set of realistic mock quasar

distribution function and flux power spectrum. The differences in the matter
power spectra translate into a ~2.5% (5%) difference in the flux power spectrum
for neutrino masses with Sigma m_{\nu} = 0.3 eV (0.6 eV). This rather small
effect is difficult to detect from present Lyman-alpha forest data and nearly
perfectly degenerate with the overall amplitude of the matter power spectrum as
characterised by sigma_8. If the results of the numerical simulations are
normalized to have the same sigma_8 in the initial conditions, then neutrinos
produce a smaller suppression in the flux power of about 3% (5%) for Sigma

a wealth of well-constrained data to ""benchmark"" the physics of such objects,
since quantities like metallicity and age can be determined from their
well-studied primaries. We present results from an adaptive optics imaging
program on stars drawn from the Anglo-Australian and Keck Planet Search
projects, with the aim of directly imaging known cool companions. Simulations
have modeled the expected contrast ratios and separations of known companions
using estimates of orbital parameters available from current radial-velocity
data and then a selection of the best case objects were followed-up with high
contrast imaging to attempt to directly image these companions. These
simulations suggest that only a very small number of radial-velocity detected
exoplanets with consistent velocity fits and age estimates could potentially be
directly imaged using the VLT's Simultaneous Differential Imaging system and
only under favorable conditions. We also present detectability confidence
limits from the radial-velocity data sets and show how these can be used to
gain a better understanding of these systems when combined with the imaging
data. For HD32778 and HD91204 the detectabilities help little in constraining
the companion and hence almost all our knowledge is drawn from the SDI images.
Therefore, we can say that these stars do not host cool methane objects, out to
on-sky separations of ~2'', with contrasts less than 10-11 magnitudes. However,
for HD25874, HD120780 and HD145825, the contrasts and detectabilities can rule
out a number of possible solutions, particularly at low angular separations,
and for the best case, down to strong methane masses of 40MJ at 1'' separation.
The contrast curves constructed for these five stars show 5 sigma contrasts
(Delta F1) of ~9.2-11.5 magnitudes at separations of >/=0.6'', which correspond
to contrasts of ~9.7-12.0 magnitudes for companions of mid-T spectral type.
Such limits allow us to reach down to 40MJ around fairly old field dwarfs that
typically constitute high precision radial-velocity programs. Finally, the
analysis performed here can serve as a template for future projects that will
employ extreme-AO systems to directly image planets already indirectly
discovered by the radial-velocity method.

around three evolved stars in the Cygnus-X star forming region. One of the
objects, BD+43 3710, has a bipolar nebula, possibly due to an outflow or a
torus of material. A second, HBHA 4202-22, a Wolf-Rayet candidate, shows a
circular shell of 24 micron emission suggestive of either a limb-brightened
shell or disk seen face-on. No diffuse emission was detected around either of
these two objects in the Spitzer 3.6-8 micron Infrared Array Camera (IRAC)
bands. The third object is the luminous blue variable candidate G79.29+0.46. We
resolved the previously known inner ring in all four IRAC bands. The 24 micron
emission from the inner ring extends ~1.2 arcmin beyond the shorter wavelength
emission, well beyond what can be attributed to the difference in resolutions
between MIPS and IRAC. Additionally, we have discovered an outer ring of 24
micron emission, possibly due to an earlier episode of mass loss. For the two
shell stars, we present the results of radiative transfer models, constraining
the stellar and dust shell parameters. The shells are composed of amorphous
carbon grains, plus polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the case of
G79.29+0.46. Both G79.29+0.46 and HBHA 4202-22 lie behind the main Cygnus-X
cloud. Although G79.29+0.46 may simply be on the far side of the cloud, HBHA
4202-22 is unrelated to the Cygnus-X star formation region.

practice to then construct a confidence interval for theta with nominal

selected model had been given to us a priori(as the true model). We call this
the naive 1-alpha confidence interval for theta. This assumption is false and
it may lead to this confidence interval having minimum coverage probability far
below 1-alpha, making it completely inadequate. Our aim is to compute this
minimum coverage probability. It is straightforward to find an expression for
the coverage probability of this confidence interval that is a multiple
integral of dimension s+1. However, we derive a new elegant and
computationally-convenient formula for this coverage probability. For s=2 this
formula is a sum of a triple and a double integral and for all s>2 this formula
is a sum of a quadruple and a double integral. This makes it easy to compute
the minimum coverage probability of the naive confidence interval, irrespective
of how large s is. A very important practical application of this formula is to
the analysis of covariance. In this context, tau can be defined so that H_0
expresses the hypothesis of ""parallelism"". Applied statisticians commonly
recommend carrying out a preliminary F test of this hypothesis. We illustrate
the application of our formula with a real-life analysis of covariance data set

low-solubility solute, with emphasis on how the thermodynamics is reflected in
the correlation functions. The model is treated in Bethe-Guggenheim
approximation, which is exact on a Bethe lattice (Cayley tree). The solution
properties are obtained in the limit of infinite dilution of the solute. With
$h_{11}(r)$, $h_{12}(r)$, and $h_{22}(r)$ the three pair correlation functions
as functions of the separation $r$ (subscripts 1 and 2 referring to solvent and
solute, respectively), we find for $r \geq 2$ lattice steps that
$h_{22}(r)/h_{12}(r) \equiv h_{12}(r)/h_{11}(r)$. This illustrates a general
theorem that holds in the asymptotic limit of infinite $r$. The three
correlation functions share a common exponential decay length (correlation
length), but when the solubility of the solute is low the amplitude of the
decay of $h_{22}(r)$ is much greater than that of $h_{12}(r)$, which in turn is
much greater than that of $h_{11}(r)$. As a consequence the amplitude of the
decay of $h_{22}(r)$ is enormously greater than that of $h_{11}(r)$. The
effective solute-solute attraction then remains discernible at distances at
which the solvent molecules are essentially no longer correlated, as found in
similar circumstances in an earlier model. The second osmotic virial
coefficient is large and negative, as expected. We find that the
solvent-mediated part $W(r)$ of the potential of mean force between solutes,
evaluated at contact, $r=1$, is related in this model to the Gibbs free energy
of solvation at fixed pressure, $\Delta G_p^*$, by $(Z/2) W(1) + \Delta G_p^*
\equiv p v_0$, where $Z$ is the coordination number of the lattice, $p$ the
pressure, and $v_0$ the volume of the cell associated with each lattice site. A
large, positive $\Delta G_p^*$ associated with the low solubility is thus
reflected in a strong attraction (large negative $W$ at contact), which is the
major contributor to the second osmotic virial coefficient. In this model, the
low solubility (large positive $\Delta G_p^*$) is due partly to an unfavorable
enthalpy of solvation and partly to an unfavorable solvation entropy, unlike in
the hydrophobic effect, where the enthalpy of solvation itself favors high
solubility, but is overweighed by the unfavorable solvation entropy.

subsets of galaxies at flux levels well below the FIR catalogue detection
limits of SWIRE and other Spitzer surveys. We tabulate the contribution of
different subsets of galaxies to the FIR background at 70um and 160um. These
long wavelengths provide a good constraint on the bolometric, obscured
emission. The large area provides good constraints at low z and in finer
redshift bins than previous work. At all redshifts we find that the specific
FIR Luminosity (sLFIR) decreases with increasing mass, following a trend
L_FIR/M* propto M_* ^beta with beta =-0.38\pm0.14. This is a more continuous
change than expected from the {Delucia2007} semi-analytic model suggesting
modifications to the feedback prescriptions. We see an increase in the sLFIR by
about a factor of ~100 from 0<z<2 and find that the sLFIR evolves as
(1+z)^alpha with alpha=4.4\pm0.3 for galaxies with 10.5 < log M*/Msun < 12.
This is considerably steeper than the {Delucia2007} semi-analytic model (alpha
\sim 2.5). When separating galaxies into early and late types on the basis of
the optical/IR spectral energy distributions we find that the decrease in sLFIR
with stellar mass is stronger in early type galaxies (beta ~ -0.46), while late
type galaxies exhibit a flatter trend (beta \sim -0.15). The evolution is
strong for both classes but stronger for the early type galaxies. The early
types show a trend of decreasing strength of evolution as we move from lower to
higher masses while the evolution of the late type galaxies has little
dependence on stellar mass. We suggest that in late-type galaxies we are seeing
a consistently declining sSFR..

unambiguous discrimination problems. I show that the prior information about
any type of constituent (state, channel, or observable) allows us to
reformulate the discrimination among finite number of alternatives as the
discrimination among finite number of average constituents. Using this
framework I solve several unambiguous tasks. I present a solution to optimal
unambiguous comparison of two ensembles of unknown quantum states. I consider
two cases: 1) The two unknown states are arbitrary pure states of qudits. 2)
Alternatively, they are coherent states of single-mode optical fields. For this
case I propose simple and optimal experimental setup composed of beam-splitters
and a photodetector. As a second tasks I consider an unambiguous identification
(UI) of coherent states. In this task identical quantum systems are prepared in
coherent states and labeled as unknown and reference states, respectively. The
promise is that one reference state is the same as the unknown state and the
task is to find out unambiguously which one it is. The particular choice of the
reference states is unknown to us, and only the probability distribution
describing this choice is known. In a general case when multiple copies of
unknown and reference states are available I propose a scheme consisting of
beamsplitters and photodetectors that is optimal within linear optics. UI can
be considered as a search in a quantum database, whose elements are the
reference states and the query is represented by the unknown state. This
perspective motivated me to show that reference states can be recovered after
the measurement and might be used (with reduced success rate) in subsequent UI.
Moreover, I analyze the influence of noise in preparation of coherent states on
the performance of the proposed setup. Another problem I address is the
unambiguous comparison of a pair of unknown qudit unitary channels. I
characterize all solutions and identify the optimal ones. I prove that in
optimal experiments for comparison of unitary channels the entanglement is
necessary. The last task I studied is the unambiguous comparison of unknown
non-degenerate projective measurements. I distinguish between measurement
devices with apriori labeled and unlabeled outcomes. In both cases only the
difference of the measurements can be concluded unambiguously. For the labeled
case I derive the optimal strategy if each unknown measurement is used only
once. However, if the apparatuses are not labeled, then each measurement device
must be used (at least) twice. In particular, for qubit measurement apparatuses
with unlabeled outcomes I derive the optimal test state in the two-shots
scenario.

The value of the saturated velocity shows very weak dependence on the carrier
density, the nature of the insulating substrate, and the low-field mobility,
varied by the charged impurity concentration. The saturated velocity of 4 - 8 x
10^7 cm/s calculated at room temperature is significantly larger than reported

lowers substantially the value of the saturated velocity. We predict that by
reducing the insulator oxide thickness, which limits the thermal conductance,
the saturated currents can be significantly enhanced. We also calculate the
surface polar phonon contribution to the low-field mobility as a function of
carrier density, temperature, and distance from the substrate.

infer the relevance of search results for queries. However it is not very
meaningful to look at the raw click through rate of a search result because the
likelihood of a result being clicked depends not only on its relevance but also
the position in which it is displayed. One model of the browsing behavior, the
{\em Examination Hypothesis} \cite{RDR07,Craswell08,DP08}, states that each
position has a certain probability of being examined and is then clicked based
on the relevance of the search snippets. This is based on eye tracking studies
\cite{Claypool01, GJG04} which suggest that users are less likely to view
results in lower positions. Such a position dependent variation in the
probability of examining a document is referred to as {\em position bias}. Our
main observation in this study is that the position bias tends to differ with
the kind of information the user is looking for. This makes the position bias
{\em query specific}. In this study, we present a model for analyzing a query
specific position bias from the click data and use these biases to derive
position independent relevance values of search results. Our model is based on
the assumption that for a given query, the positional click through rate of a
document is proportional to the product of its relevance and a {\em query
specific} position bias. We compare our model with the vanilla examination
hypothesis model (EH) on a set of queries obtained from search logs of a
commercial search engine. We also compare it with the User Browsing Model (UBM)
\cite{DP08} which extends the cascade model of Craswell et al\cite{Craswell08}
by incorporating multiple clicks in a query session. We show that the our
model, although much simpler to implement, consistently outperforms both EH and
UBM on well-used measures such as relative error and cross entropy.

optical and near-IR photometry. Our sample is complete to 1 Msun (excluding A

al. (2000) isochrone fits to the near-IR color-magnitude diagram, we derive
ages of 3.5 (+0.75/-1.0) and 5.25 (+1.5/-1.0) Myrs for sources in the two
fields, both with considerable spreads around the pre-MS isochrones. The
presence of a stellar population somewhat older than the present-day O-type
stars, also fits in with the low fraction of sources with inner circumstellar
disks (as traced by the K-band excess) that we find to be very low, but
appropriate for a population of age ~5 Myrs. We also find that the region lacks
a population of highly embedded sources that is often observed in young star
forming regions, suggesting star formation in the vicinity has declined. We
measure the stellar mass functions in this limit and find a power-law slope of
Gamma = -1.09 +/- 0.13, in good agreement with the global mean value estimated
by Kroupa (2002). A steepening of the slope at higher masses is observed and
suggested as due to the presence of the previous generation of stars that have
lost their most massive members. Finally, combining our mass function and an
estimate of the radial density profile of the association suggests a total mass
of Cyg OB2 of ~3 x 10^4 Msun, similar to that of many of our Galaxy's most

structure in Ni/Co3O4(011) is reported. Large exchange anisotropies are
observed at low temperatures, and the exchange bias effect persists to
temperatures well above the Neel temperature of bulk Co3O4, of about 40 K: to
~80 K for Ni films deposited on well ordered oxide surfaces, and ~150 K for Ni
films deposited on rougher Co3O4 surfaces. Photoelectron spectroscopy
measurements as a function of Ni thickness show that Co reduction and Ni
oxidation occur over an extended interfacial region. We conclude that the
exchange bias observed in Ni/Co3O4, and in similar ferromagnetic metallic/Co3O4
systems, is not intrinsic to Co3O4 but rather due to the formation of CoO at
the interface.

if it is measured by the completion of each countably additive $\sigma$-finite
Borel measure on the space, and \emph{universally null} if it has measure zero
for each such atomless measure. In 1908, Hausdorff proved that there exist
universally null sets of real numbers of cardinality $\aleph_{1}$, and thus
that there exist at least $2^{\aleph_{1}}$ such sets. Laver showed in the
1970's that consistently there are just continuum many universally null sets of
reals. The question of whether there exist more than continuum many universally
measurable sets of reals was asked by Mauldin in 1978. We show that
consistently there exist only continuum many universally measurable sets. This
result also follows from work of Ciesielski and Pawlikowski on the iterated
Sacks model. In the models we consider (forcing extensions by suitably-sized
random algebras) every set of reals is universally measurable if and only if it
and its complement are unions of ground model continuum many Borel sets.

compact binary coalescence sources detectable by the Initial and Advanced
versions of the ground-based gravitational-wave detectors LIGO and Virgo.
Astrophysical estimates for compact-binary coalescence rates depend on a number
of assumptions and unknown model parameters, and are still uncertain. The most
confident among these estimates are the rate predictions for coalescing binary
neutron stars which are based on extrapolations from observed binary pulsars in
our Galaxy. These yield a likely coalescence rate of 100 per Myr per Milky Way
Equivalent Galaxy (MWEG), although the rate could plausibly range from 1 per
Myr per MWEG to 1000 per Myr per MWEG. We convert coalescence rates into
detection rates based on data from the LIGO S5 and Virgo VSR2 science runs and
projected sensitivities for our Advanced detectors. Using the detector
sensitivities derived from these data, we find a likely detection rate of 0.02
per year for Initial LIGO-Virgo interferometers, with a plausible range between
0.0002 and 0.2 per year. The likely binary neutron-star detection rate for the
Advanced LIGO-Virgo network increases to 40 events per year, with a range
between 0.4 and 400 per year.

operator spectrum [J Phys A 2007) in mean field media, and its Krein space
related perturbation theory [J Phys A 2006). Earlier, an example of fast
dynamos in stretch shear and fold Anosov maps have been given by Gilbert [PRSA
[1993)). In this paper, analytical solutions representing general turbulent
dynamo filaments are obtained in resistive plasmas. When turbulent diffusivity
is present and kinetic helicity vanishes, a fast dynamo mode is obtained, and
the Anosov eigenvalue obtained. The magnetic field lays down on a Frenet 2
plane along the filaments embedded in a 3D flow. Curvature effects on fast
dynamo are also investigate. In case of weak curvature filaments the one
dimensional manifolds in plasmas present a fast dynamo action. A parallel
result has been obtained by Chicone et al [Comm Math Phys), in the case fast
dynamo spectrum in two dimensional compact Riemannian manifolds of negative
constant curvature, called Anosov spaces. While problems of embedding may
appear in their case here no embedding problems appear since the one
dimensional curved plasmas are embedded in three dimensional Euclidean spaces.
In the examples considered here, equipartion between normal and binormal
components of the magnetic field components is considered. In the opposite
case, non Anosov oscillatory, purely imaginary, branches of the spectrum are
found in dynamo manifold. Negative constant curvature non-compact
$\textbf{H}^{2}$ manifold, has also been used in one-component electron 2D

non-stretching flux tubes [Phys Plasmas 15 (2008)]. In this paper, another
anti-dynamo theorem, called Cowling's theorem, which states that axisymmetric
magnetic fields cannot support dynamo action, is carefully tested against thick
tubular and curved Riemannian untwisted flows, as well as thin flux tubes in
diffusive and diffusionless media. In the non-diffusive media the Cowling's
theorem is not violated in thin Riemann-flat untwisted flux tubes, where the
Frenet curvature is negative. Nevertheless the diffusion action in the thin
flux tube leads to a a dynamo action driven by poloidal flows as shown by Love
and Gubbins (Geophysical Res.) in the context of geodynamos. Actually it is
shown that a slow dynamo action is obtained. In this case the Frenet and
Riemann curvature still vanishes. In the case of magnetic filaments in
diffusive media dynamo action is obtained when the Frenet scalar curvature is
negative. Since the Riemann curvature tensor can be expressed in terms of the
Frenet curvature of the magnetic flux tube axis, this result can be analogous
to a recent result obtained by Chicone, Latushkin and Smith, which states that
geodesic curvature in compact Riemannian manifolds can drive dynamo action in
the manifold. It is also shown that in absence of diffusion, magnetic energy
does not grow but magnetic toroidal magnetic field can be generated by the
poloidal field, what is called a plasma dynamo.

supernovae in elliptical galaxies. The single degenerate scenario (a white
dwarf accreting from a late main sequence or red giant companion) is tested
against the double degenerate scenario (the spiral-in and merging of two white
dwarfs through the emission of gravitational wave radiation). We use a
population number synthesis code incorporating the latest physical results in
binary evolution, and allowing to differentiate between certain physical
scenarios (e.g. description of common envelope evolution) and evolutionary
parameters (e.g. mass transfer efficiency during Roche lobe overflow). The
obtained theoretical distributions of the delay times of type Ia supernovae are
compared to those which are observed, both in morphological shape and absolute
number of events. The critical dependency of these distributions on certain
parameters is used to constrain the values of the latter. We find that the
single degenerate scenario alone cannot explain the morphological shape of the
observational delay time distribution, while the double degenerate scenario (or
a combination of both) can. Most of these double degenerate type Ia supernovae
are created through a normal quasi-conservative Roche lobe overflow followed by
a common envelope phase, not through two successive common envelope phases.
This may cast doubt on the use in other studies of analytical formalisms to
determine delay times. In terms of absolute number, theoretical supernova Ia
rates in old elliptical galaxies lie a factor of at least three below the
observed ones. We propose a solution involving the effect of rotation on the
evolution of intermediate mass binaries.

sensitive to Anderson localization on the one-particle level and hence can

an increase of the local $f$-moments in the presence of disordered conduction

Here I focus on stochastic acceleration in the lobes. I show that the
requirement that they accelerate protons to the highest observed energies
places constraints on the observable properties of radio lobes that are
satisfied by a relatively small number of objects within the
Greisen-Zat'sepin-Kuzmin (GZK) cutoff; if UHECR are protons and are accelerated
within radio lobes, their sources are probably already known and catalogued
radio galaxies. I show that lobe acceleration also implies a (charge-dependent)
upper energy limit on the UHECR that can be produced in this way; if lobes are
the dominant accelerators in the local universe and if UHECR are predominantly
protons, we are unlikely to see cosmic rays much higher in energy than those we
have already observed. I comment on the viability of the stochastic
acceleration mechanism and the likely composition of cosmic rays accelerated in
this way, based on our current understanding of the contents of the large-scale
lobes of radio galaxies, and finally discuss the implications of stochastic
lobe acceleration for the future of cosmic ray astronomy.

emission in Halpha as well as in the ultraviolet. Although most galaxies with
strong Halpha truncations near R25 show a significant corresponding falloff in
UV emission (factor 10--100), the transition tends to be much smoother than in
Halpha, and significant UV emission often extends well beyond this radius,
confirming earlier results by Thilker et al. (2007) and others. After
correcting for dust attenuation the median fraction of total FUV emission from
regions outside of R25 is 1.7%, but it can be as high as 35% in the most
extreme cases. The corresponding fractions of Halpha emission are approximately
half as large on average. This difference reflects both a slightly lower ratio
of Halpha to UV emission in the HII regions in the outer discs, as well as a
lower fraction of star clusters showing HII regions. Most HII regions in the
extended disc have fluxes consistent with small numbers of ionising O-type
stars, and this poor sampling of the upper initial mass function in small
clusters can probably account for the differences in the emission properties,
consistent with earlier conclusions by Zaritsky & Christlein (2007), without
needing to invoke a significant change in the stellar IMF itself. Consistent
Ha/FUV ratios and brightest HII region to total Halpha fluxes in the inner and
extended discs across our whole galaxy sample demonstrate no evidence for a
change in the cluster luminosity function or the IMF in the low gas density
outer disc.

11-year solar cycle exhibits long-term variations due to the varying time lag
between the sunspot-related and non-sunspot related geomagnetic activity, and
the varying relative amplitude of the respective geomagnetic activity peaks. As
the sunspot-related and non-sunspot related geomagnetic activity are caused by
different solar agents, related to the solar toroidal and poloidal fields,
respectively, we use their variations to derive the parameters of the solar
dynamo transforming the poloidal field into toroidal field and back. We find
that in the last 12 cycles the solar surface meridional circulation varied
between 5 and 20 m/s (averaged over latitude and over the sunspot cycle), the
deep circulation varied between 2.5 and 5.5 m/s, and the diffusivity in the
whole of the convection zone was ~10**8 m2/s. In the last 12 cycles solar
dynamo has been operating in moderately diffusion dominated regime in the bulk
of the convection zone. This means that a part of the poloidal field generated
at the surface is advected by the meridional circulation all the way to the
poles, down to the tachocline and equatorward to sunspot latitudes, while
another part is diffused directly to the tachocline at midlatitudes,
""short-circuiting"" the meridional circulation. The sunspot maximum is the
superposition of the two surges of toroidal field generated by these two parts
of the poloidal field, which is the explanation of the double peaks and the
Gnevyshev gap in sunspot maximum. Near the tachocline, dynamo has been
operating in diffusion dominated regime in which diffusion is more important
than advection, so with increasing speed of the deep circulation the time for
diffusive decay of the poloidal field decreases, and more toroidal field is
generated leading to a higher sunspot maximum. During the Maunder minimum the
dynamo was operating in advection dominated regime near the tachocline, with
the transition from diffusion dominated to advection dominated regime caused by
a sharp drop in the surface meridional circulation which is in general the most
important factor modulating the amplitude of the sunspot cycle.

pulse energy from 7 $\mu$J up to 55 $\mu$J in the NDR requires a dispersion
scaling from -0.013 ps$^{2}$ up to -0.31 ps$^{2}$ to provide the pulse

the PDR requires a moderate dispersion scaling from 0.0023 ps$^{2}$ up to 0.011
ps$^{2}$. A chirped picosecond pulse in the PDR has a broader spectrum than
that of a chirp-free soliton in the NDR. As a result, a chirped picosecond
pulse can be compressed down to a few of hundreds of femtoseconds. A unique
property of the PDR has been found to be an extremely reduced timing jitter.
The numerical results agree with the analytical theory, when spectral

mystery up to now, although there exist many models. The light curves of some
LSPs stars mimic an eclipsing binary with a pulsating red giant component. To
test this hypothesis, the observational data of two LSP variable red giants,
77.7795.29 and 77.8031.42, discovered by the MACHO project from the LMC, are
collected and analyzed. The probable eclipsing features of the light curves are
simulated by the Wilson-Devinney (W-D) method. The simulation yields a contact
and a semidetached geometry for the two systems, respectively. In addition, the
pulsation constant of the main pulsating component in each binary system is
derived. By combining the results of the binary model and the pulsation
component, we investigate the feasibility of the pulsating binary model. It is
found that the radial velocity curve expected from the binary model has a much
larger amplitude than the observed one and a period double the observed one.
Furthermore, the masses of the components based on the density derived from the
binary orbit solution are too low to be compatible with both the evolutionary
stage and the high luminosity. Although the pulsation mode identified by the
pulsation constant which is dependent on the density from the binary-model is
consistent with the first or second overtone radial pulsation, we conclude that
the pulsating binary model is a defective model for the LSP.

Starting from a hydrodynamical input characterizing the homologously-expanding
ejecta at a chosen post-explosion time, we model the evolution of the entire
ejecta, including gas and radiation. Non-LTE, which holds in all regions at and
above the photosphere, is accounted for. The effects of line blanketing on the
radiation field are explicitly included, using complex model atoms and solving
for all ion level populations appearing in the statistical-equilibrium
equations. Here, we present results for SN1987A, evolving the model ""lm18a7Ad""
of Woosley from 0.27 to 20.8d. The fastest evolution occurs prior to day 1,
with a spectral energy distribution peaking in the range 300-2000A, subject to
line blanketing from highly ionized metal and CNO species. After day 1, our
synthetic multi-band light curve and spectra reproduce the observations to
within 10-20% in flux in the optical, with a greater mismatch for the faint UV
flux. We do not encounter any of the former discrepancies associated with the
HeI and HI lines in the optical, which can be fitted well with a standard
Blue-supergiant-star surface composition and no contribution from radioactive
decay. The effects of time dependence on the ionization structure, discussed in
Dessart & Hillier, are recovered, and thus nicely integrated in this new
scheme. Despite the 1D nature of our approach, its high physical consistency
and accuracy will allow reliable inferences to be made on explosion properties

of a random Hamiltonian order by order in a Taylor expansion. In our previous
work we assumed Lorentz symmetry of the field theory, which entered through the
dispersion relation. Here we extend that work to consider a generalized
dispersion relation and show that the Lorentz symmetric case is preferred, in
that the Lorentz symmetric dispersion relation gives a better approximation to
a random Hamiltonian than the other local dispersion relations we considered.

The nature of
this process is not yet properly understood. Here we offer a simple explanation
according to which birds literally `see' the local magnetic field: Our model
relates the well-established radical pair hypothesis to the phenomenon of
Haidinger's brush, a capacity to see the polarisation of light. This new
picture explains recent surprising experimental data indicating long lifetimes
for the radical pair. Moreover there is a clear evolutionary path toward this
field sensing mechanism: it is an enhancement of a weak effect that may be
present in many species.

affect the motion of a charge along the field. This argument seems to imply
absence of longitudinal magnetoresistance (LMR) which is, however, observed in
many materials and reproduced by standard semiclassical transport theory
applied to particular metals. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition on
the shape of the Fermi surface for non-zero LMR. Although an anisotropic
spectrum is a pre-requisite for LMR, not all types of anisotropy can give rise
to the effect: a spectrum should not be separable in any sense. More precisely,
the combination $k_{\rho}v_{\phi}/v_{\rho}$, where $k_\rho$ is the radial
component of the momentum in a cylindrical system with the z-axis along the
magnetic field and $v_{\rho} (v_{\phi}$) is the radial (tangential) component
of the velocity, should depend on the momentum along the field. For some
lattice types, this condition is satisfied already at the level of
nearest-neighbor hopping; for others, the required non-separabality occurs only
if next-to-nearest-neighbor hopping is taken into account.

impurities is computationally observed in near-optimally doped d-wave
superconductors (DSCs). For the single impurity case, a transition from the
checkerboard to stripe pattern can be induced even with a very weak LA.
Moreover, the modulation period of eight lattice constants (8$a$) in the spin
order coincides with neutron scattering data. For the two-impurity case, an
orientation transition from the longitudinal impurity-pinned stripe into the
transverse pattern is observed when the LA ratio reaches some critical value.
At the critical point, it is found that the structures around magnetic
impurities could restore checkerboard patterns. These results indicate that the
formation of stripes in DSCs might induced by various effects, and could be
tunable experimentally.
