microwave background (CMB) from WMAP5 (Komatsu et al. 2009), the integrated
Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect from the cross-correlation of the CMB with six galaxy
catalogs (Giannantonio et al. 2008), a compilation of supernovae Type Ia (SNe)
including the latest SDSS SNe (Kessler et al. 2009), and part of the weak
lensing (WL) data from CFHTLS (Fu et al. 2008, Kilbinger et al. 2009) that
probe linear and mildly non-linear scales. We first test a model where the
effective Newton's constant, mu, and the ratio of the two gravitational
potentials, eta, transit from the GR value to another constant at late times;
in this case, we find that standard GR is fully consistent with the combined
data. The strongest constraint comes from the ISW effect which would arise from
this gravitational transition; the observed ISW signal imposes a tight
constraint on a combination of mu and eta that characterizes the lensing
potential. Next, we consider four pixels in time and space for each function mu
and eta, and perform a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) finding that seven of
the resulting eight eigenmodes are consistent with GR within the errors. Only
one eigenmode shows a 2-sigma deviation from the GR prediction, which is likely
to be due to a systematic effect. However, the detection of such a deviation
demonstrates the power of our time- and scale-dependent PCA methodology when
combining observations of structure formation and expansion history to test GR.

were identified in 178 deg^2 of sky surveyed in 2008 by the South Pole
Telescope to a depth of 18 uK-arcmin at 150 GHz. Optical imaging from the
Blanco Cosmology Survey (BCS) and Magellan telescopes provided photometric (and
in some cases spectroscopic) redshift estimates, with catalog redshifts ranging
from z=0.15 to z>1, with a median z = 0.74. Of the 21 confirmed galaxy
clusters, three were previously identified as Abell clusters, three were
presented as SPT discoveries in Staniszewski et al, 2009, and three were first
identified in a recent analysis of BCS data by Menanteau et al, 2010; the
remaining 12 clusters are presented for the first time in this work. Simulated
observations of the SPT fields predict the sample to be nearly 100% complete
above a mass threshold of M_200 ~ 5x10^14 M_sun/h at z = 0.6. This completeness
threshold pushes to lower mass with increasing redshift, dropping to ~4x10^14
M_sun/h at z=1. The size and redshift distribution of this catalog are in good
agreement with expectations based on our current understanding of galaxy
clusters and cosmology. In combination with other cosmological probes, we use
the cluster catalog to improve estimates of cosmological parameters. Assuming a
standard spatially flat wCDM cosmological model, the addition of our catalog to
the WMAP 7-year analysis yields sigma_8 = 0.81 +- 0.09 and w = -1.07 +- 0.29, a
~50% improvement in precision on both parameters over WMAP7 alone.

an additional, unconfirmed candidate, were detected in a 178 square-degree area
surveyed by the South Pole Telescope in 2008. Using griz imaging from the

well as spectroscopy using Magellan facilities, we confirm the existence of
clustered red-sequence galaxies, report red-sequence photometric redshifts,
present spectroscopic redshifts for a subsample, and derive R_200 radii and
M_200 masses from optical richness. The clusters span redshifts from 0.15 to
greater than 1, with a median redshift of 0.74; three clusters are estimated to
be at z > 1. Redshifts inferred from mean red-sequence colors exhibit 2% RMS
scatter in sigma_z/(1+z) with respect to the spectroscopic subsample for z < 1.
We show that M_200 cluster masses derived from optical richness correlate with

scaling relations to within the uncertainties. Optical and infrared imaging is
an efficient means of cluster identification and redshift estimation in large
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich surveys, and exploiting the same data for richness
measurements, as we have done, will be useful for constraining cluster masses
and radii for large samples in cosmological analysis.

attractive within the context of Asymmetric Dark Matter models. In such models,
the cosmological dark matter density arises from the baryon asymmetry of the
universe, naturally leading to the expectation that m_DM ~ 1-10 GeV. We also
discuss neutralino dark matter from extended supersymmetric frameworks, such as
the NMSSM. Lastly, we explore the implications of such a dark matter candidate
for indirect searches, and find that the prospects for detecting the neutrino

ejection in bacteriophage lambda. Past work has demonstrated that bacteriophage
DNA is highly pressurized; this pressure has been hypothesized to help drive
DNA ejection. Ions influence this process by screening charges on DNA; however,
a systematic variation of salt concentrations to explore these effects has not
been undertaken. To study the nature of the forces driving DNA ejection, we
performed in vitro measurements of DNA ejection in bulk and at the single-phage
level. We present measurements on the dynamics of ejection and on the
self-repulsion force driving ejection. We examine the role of ion concentration
and identity in both measurements, and show that the charge of counter-ions is
an important control parameter. These measurements show that the frictional
force acting on the ejecting DNA is subtly dependent on ionic concentrations
for a given amount of DNA in the capsid. We also present evidence that phage
DNA forms loops during ejection; we confirm that this effect occurs using
optical tweezers. We speculate this facilitates circularization of the genome
in the cytoplasm.

interactions on the rotation perturbed by the solar gravitational interaction,
by modeling the core as an ellipsoidal cavity filled with inviscid fluid of

We express in particular the proper frequencies of the system, because they
characterize the response of Mercury to the different solicitations, due to the
orbital motion of Mercury around the Sun. We show that, contrary to its size,
the shape of the core cannot be determined from observations of either
longitudinal or polar motions. However, we highlight the strong influence of a
resonance between the proper frequency of the core and the spin of Mercury that
raises the velocity field inside the core. We show that the key parameter is
the polar flattening of the core. This effect cannot be directly derived from
observations of the surface of Mercury, but we cannot exclude the possibility
of an indirect detection by measuring the magnetic field.

Traditionally, encoding in this framework is done by solving an l_1-regularized
linear regression problem, usually called Lasso. In this work we first combine
the sparsity-inducing property of the Lasso model, at the individual feature
level, with the block-sparsity property of the group Lasso model, where sparse
groups of features are jointly encoded, obtaining a sparsity pattern
hierarchically structured. This results in the hierarchical Lasso, which shows
important practical modeling advantages. We then extend this approach to the
collaborative case, where a set of simultaneously coded signals share the same
sparsity pattern at the higher (group) level but not necessarily at the lower
one. Signals then share the same active groups, or classes, but not necessarily
the same active set. This is very well suited for applications such as source
separation. An efficient optimization procedure, which guarantees convergence
to the global optimum, is developed for these new models. The underlying
presentation of the new framework and optimization approach is complemented
with experimental examples and preliminary theoretical results.

crystal waveguides, specifically addressing the influence of local field
effects and scattering within high-index-contrast perturbations. Local field
effects are shown to increase the predicted disorder-induced scattering loss
and result in significant resonance shifts of the waveguide mode. We
demonstrate that two types of frequency shifts can be expected, a mean
frequency shift and a RMS frequency shift, both acting in concert to blueshift
and broaden the nominal band structure. For a representative waveguide, we
predict substantial meV frequency shifts and band structure broadening for a
telecommunications operating frequency, even for state of the art fabrication.
The disorder-induced broadening is found to increase as the propagation
frequency approaches the slow light regime (mode edge) due to restructuring of
the electric field distribution. These findings have a dramatic impact on
high-index-contrast nanoscale waveguides, and, for photonic crystal waveguides,
suggest that the nominal slow-light mode edge may not even exist. Furthermore,
our results shed new light on why it has hitherto been impossible to observe
the very slow light regime for photonic crystal waveguides.

real-time detection, a new challenge to anomaly detection, requires improvement
on the real-time capability of the DCA. To assess such capability, formal
methods in the research of rea-time systems can be employed. The findings of
the assessment can provide guideline for the future development of the
algorithm. Therefore, in this paper we use an interval logic based method,
named the Duration Calculus (DC), to specify a simplified single-cell model of
the DCA. Based on the DC specifications with further induction, we find that
each individual cell in the DCA can perform its function as a detector in
real-time. Since the DCA can be seen as many such cells operating in parallel,
it is potentially capable of performing real-time detection. However, the
analysis process of the standard DCA constricts its real-time capability. As a
result, we conclude that the analysis process of the standard DCA should be
replaced by a real-time analysis component, which can perform periodic analysis
for the purpose of real-time detection.

to sample with standard Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. We propose a
strategy to enhance the sampling of MCMC in this context, using a biasing
procedure which originates from computational Statistical Physics. The
principle is first to choose a ""reaction coordinate"", that is, a ""direction"" in
which the target distribution is multimodal. In a second step, the marginal
log-density of the reaction coordinate with respect to the posterior
distribution is estimated; minus this quantity is called ""free energy"" in the
computational Statistical Physics literature. To this end, we use adaptive
biasing Markov chain algorithms which adapt their targeted invariant
distribution on the fly, in order to overcome sampling barriers along the
chosen reaction coordinate. Finally, we perform an importance sampling step in
order to remove the bias and recover the true posterior. The efficiency factor
of the importance sampling step can easily be estimated \emph{a priori} once
the bias is known, and appears to be rather large for the test cases we
considered. A crucial point is the choice of the reaction coordinate. One
standard choice (used for example in the classical Wang-Landau algorithm) is
minus the log-posterior density. We discuss other choices. We show in
particular that the hyper-parameter that determines the order of magnitude of
the variance of each component is both a convenient and an efficient reaction
coordinate. We also show how to adapt the method to compute the evidence
(marginal likelihood) of a mixture model. We illustrate our approach by
analyzing two real data sets.

which might exhibit a range of scales over which the running coupling constant
evolves very slowly (walks). We simulate lattice QCD with 2 flavours of sextet
staggered quarks to determine whether walks, or if it has an infrared fixed
point, making it a conformal field theory. Our initial simulations are
performed at finite temperatures $T=1/N_ta$ ($N_t=4$ and $N_t=6$), which allows
us to identify the scales of confinement and chiral-symmetry breaking from the
deconfinement and chiral-symmetry restoring transitions. Unlike QCD with
fundamental quarks, these two transitions appear to be well-separated. The
change in coupling constants at these transitions between the two different
temporal extents $N_t$, is consistent with these being finite temperature
transitions for an asymptotically free theory, which favours walking behaviour.
In the deconfined phase, the Wilson Line shows a 3-state signal. Between the
confinement and chiral transitions, there is an additional transition where the
states with Wilson Lines oriented in the directions of the complex cube roots
of unity disorder into a state with a negative Wilson Line.

  The trajectory uniquely determines on the set G a system of fields called by

the CI lines arise in cold neutral gas that also gives rise to HI 21cm

likelihood of systematic errors due to local velocity offsets between the
hyperfine and resonance lines. The dominant source of systematic error lies in
the absolute wavelength calibration of the optical spectra, which appears

decentralized wireless networks of separate transmitter-receiver pairs. In
general, users are unaware of each other's codebooks and there is no central
controller to assign the resources in the network to the users. A randomized
signaling scheme is introduced in which each user locally spreads its Gaussian
signal along a randomly generated spreading code comprised of a sequence of
nonzero elements over a certain alphabet. Along with spreading, each
transmitter also masks its output independently from transmission to
transmission. Using a conditional version of entropy power inequality and a key
lemma on the differential entropy of mixed Gaussian random vectors, achievable
rates are developed for the users. It is seen that as the number of users
increases, the achievable Sum Multiplexing Gain of the network approaches that
of a centralized orthogonal scheme where multiuser interference is completely
avoided. An interesting observation is that in general the elements of a
spreading code are not equiprobable over the underlying alphabet. Finally,
using the recently developed extremal inequality of Liu-Viswanath, we present
an optimality result showing that transmission of Gaussian signals via
spreading and masking yields higher achievable rates than the maximum
achievable rate attained by applying masking only.

VI absorption is likely produced in collisionally ionized plasma under
nonequilibrium conditions. The z=0.22638 system has broad-Lya (BLA) and C III

The O VI, offset from the BLA with no detected H I or C III, is likely
collisionally ionized at T ~ 3 x 10^5 K. From the observed multiphase
properties and the proximity to a luminous galaxy, we propose that the
z=0.22496 absorber is an extragalactic analog of a highly ionized Galactic HVC,
in which the O VI is produced in transition temperature plasma (T ~ 10^5 K) at
the interface layers between the warm HVC gas phase and the hot coronal halo of
the galaxy. The z=0.22638 O VI - BLA absorber could be tracing a cooling
condensing fragment in the nearby galaxy's hot gaseous halo.

have obtained Spitzer-IRS spectroscopy of a sample of eight SMGs which are
candidates for harboring powerful AGN on the basis of IRAC color-selection
(S8/S4.5>2; i.e. likely power-law mid-infrared SEDs). SMGs with an AGN
dominating (>50%) their mid-infrared emission could represent `missing link'
sources in an evolutionary sequence involving a major merger. First of all, we
detect PAH features in all of the SMGs, indicating redshifts from 2.5-3.4,
demonstrating the power of the mid-infrared to determine redshifts for these
optically faint dusty galaxies. Secondly, we see signs of both star-formation
(from the PAH features) and AGN activity (from continuum emission) in our
sample: 62% of the sample are AGN-dominated in the mid-infrared with a median
AGN content of 56%, compared with <30% on average for typical SMGs, revealing
that our IRAC color selection has successfully singled out sources with
proportionately more AGN emission than typical SB-dominated SMGs. However, we
find that only about 10% of these AGN dominate the bolometric emission of the
SMG when the results are extrapolated to longer infrared wavelengths, implying
that AGN are not a significant power source to the SMG population overall, even
when there is evidence in the mid-infrared for substantial AGN activity. When
existing samples of mid-infrared AGN-dominated SMGs are considered, we find
that S8/S4.5>1.65 works well at selecting mid-infrared energetically dominant
AGN in SMGs, implying a duty cycle of ~15% if all SMGs go through a subsequent
mid-infrared AGN-dominated phase in the proposed evolutionary sequence.

nonlinear and viscous. In the plasma, at $z=5100$, the viscous length enters
the horizon and causes fragmentation into plasma clumps surrounded by voids.
The latter have expanded to 38 Mpc now, explaining the cosmic void scale
$30/h=42$ Mpc. After the decoupling the Jeans mechanism fragments all matter in
clumps of ca 40,000 solar masses. Each of them fragments due to viscosity in
millibrown dwarfs of earth weight, so each Jeans cluster contains billions of
them. The Jeans clusters act as ideal gas particles in the isothermal model,
explaining the flattening of rotation curves. The first stars in old globular
clusters are formed by aggregation of milli brown dwarfs, without dark period.
Star formation also happens when Jean clusters come close to each other and
agitate and heat up the cooled milli brown dwarfs, which then expand and
coalesce to form new stars. This explains the Tully-Fischer and Jackson-Faber
relations, and the formation of young globular clusters in galaxy mergers.
Thousand of milli brown dwarfs have been observed in quasar microlensing and
some 40,000 in the Helix planetary nebula.
  While the milli brown dwarfs, i.e., dark baryons, constitute the galactic
dark matter, cluster dark matter consists probably of 1.5 eV neutrinos, free
streaming at the decoupling. These two types of dark matter explain a wealth of
observations.

large-scale shape of the power spectrum. We consider the so-called local
non-Gaussianity model and forecasts from planned surveys, alone and combined
with a Planck CMB prior. In particular, we consider EUCLID- and LSST-like
surveys and forecast the correlations among $f_{\rm NL}$ and the running of the
spectral index $\alpha_s$, the dark energy equation of state $w$, the effective
sound speed of dark energy perturbations $c^2_s$, the total mass of massive
neutrinos $M_\nu=\sum m_\nu$, and the number of extra relativistic degrees of
freedom $N_\nu^{rel}$. Neglecting CMB information on $f_{\rm NL}$ and scales $k
> 0.03 h$/Mpc, we find that, if $N_\nu^{\rm rel}$ is assumed to be known, the
uncertainty on cosmological parameters increases the error on $f_{\rm NL}$ by
10 to 30% depending on the survey. Thus the $f_{\rm NL}$ constraint is
remarkable robust to cosmological model uncertainties. On the other hand, if
$N_\nu^{\rm rel}$ is simultaneously constrained from the data, the $f_{\rm NL}$
error increases by $\sim 80%$. Finally, future surveys which provide a large
sample of galaxies or galaxy clusters over a volume comparable to the Hubble
volume can measure primordial non-Gaussianity of the local form with a
marginalized 1--$\sigma$ error of the order $\Delta f_{\rm NL} \sim 2-5$, after
combination with CMB priors for the remaining cosmological parameters. These
results are competitive with CMB bispectrum constraints achievable with an

of low Galactic cirrus emission, using twin narrowband filters at each epoch
for improved stellar continuum subtraction. H-alpha luminosity functions are
presented for each Delta(z) ~ 0.02 epoch based on a total of nearly 1200
galaxies. These data clearly show an evolution with lookback time in the
volume-averaged cosmic star formation rate. Integrals of Schechter fits to the

this evolution is driven by changes in the characteristic luminosity L_* of the
H-alpha luminosity functions, with L_* for the earlier two epochs being a
factor of two larger than L_* at the latter two epochs; it is more difficult
with this data set to decipher systematic evolutionary differences in the
luminosity function amplitude and faint-end slope. Coupling these results with
a comprehensive compilation of results from the literature on emission line

droplet generation in terms of the underlying dynamics, primarily showing that
the latter is deterministically chaotic by means of nonlinear time series
analysis methods. In particular, we use a laser pulse to melt the end of a
properly fed vertically placed metal wire. Due to the interplay of surface
tension, gravity force and light-metal interaction, undulating pendant droplets
are formed at the molten end, which eventually completely detach from the wire
as a consequence of their increasing mass. We capture the dynamics of this
process by employing a high-speed infrared camera, thereby indirectly measuring
the temperature of the wire end and the pendant droplets. The time series is
subsequently generated as the mean value over the pixel intensity of every
infrared snapshot. Finally, we employ methods of nonlinear time series analysis
to reconstruct the phase space from the observed variable and test it against
determinism and stationarity. After establishing that the observed laser
droplet generation is a deterministic and dynamically stationary process, we
calculate the spectra of Lyapunov exponents. We obtain a positive largest
Lyapunov exponent and a negative divergence, i.e., sum of all the exponents,
thus indicating that the observed dynamics is deterministically chaotic with an
attractor as solution in the phase space. In addition to characterizing the

parametrized by 3 parameters: beta, gamma, and the product (Q_0 n_rms); beta
characterizes the stellar spectrum, gamma characterizes the dust/gas ratio, Q_0
is the ionizing output from the star (photons/s), and n_rms is the rms density
within the ionized region. Adopting standard values for beta and gamma, varying
(Q_0 n_rms) generates a one-parameter family of density profiles, ranging from
nearly uniform density (small Q_0 n_rms), to hollow-sphere HII regions (large
Q_0 n_rms). When (Q_0 n_rms) exceeds 10^{52} cm^{-3} s^{-1}, dusty HII regions
have conspicuous central cavities, even if no stellar wind is present. For
given beta, gamma and (Q_0 n_rms), a fourth quantity, which can be Q_0,
determines the overall size and density of the HII region. Examples of density
and emissivity profiles are given. We show how quantities of interest -- such
as the peak-to-center emissivity ratio, the rms-to-mean density ratio, the
edge-to-rms density ratio, and the fraction of the ionizing photons absorbed by
the gas -- depend on the 3 parameters beta, gamma, and (Q_0 n_rms). For dusty
HII regions, compression of the gas and dust into an ionized shell results in a
substantial increase in the fraction of the >13.6 eV photons that actually
ionize H (relative to a uniform density HII region with the same dust/gas ratio
and density n=n_rms). We discuss the extent to which radial drift of dust
grains in HII regions can alter the dust-to-gas ratio. The applicability of
these solutions to real HII regions is discussed.

compute spacetime dynamics in almost complete generality, allowing us to model
the coalescence and merger of binary black holes with essentially no
approximations. The primary limitation of these calculations is now
computational. In particular, it is difficult to model systems with large mass
ratio and large spins, since one must accurately resolve the multiple
lengthscales which play a role in such systems. Perturbation theory can play an
important role in extending the reach of computational modeling for binary
systems. In this paper, we present first results of a code which allows us to
model the gravitational waves generated by the inspiral, merger, and ringdown
of a binary system in which one member of the binary is much more massive than
the other. This allows us to accurately calibrate binary dynamics in the large
mass ratio regime. We focus in this analysis on the recoil imparted to the
merged remnant by these waves. We closely examine the ""antikick"", an anti-phase
cancellation of the recoil arising from the plunge and ringdown waves,
described in detail by Schnittman et al. We find that, for orbits aligned with
the black hole spin, the antikick grows as a function of spin. The total recoil
is smallest for prograde coalescence into a rapidly rotating black hole, and
largest for retrograde coalescence. Amusingly, this completely reverses the
predicted trend for kick versus spin from analyses that only include inspiral
information.

boundary. Materials involving only conventional bonding mechanisms are unlikely
to meet these requirements. In contrast, materials containing certain
frustrated bonding are designed to be on the verge of frustration-induced phase
transition, and they may be better suited for hydrogen storage. Here we propose
a novel layered solid boron hydride and show its potential for hydrogen

the structure. Charging the structure significantly softens hydrogen-related
phonon modes. Boron-related phonons, in contrast, are either hardened or not

conjecture, that all graded submodules of the $d$-shift Hilbert module $H^2$

(and ideals): a normed module $M$ over the ring of polynomials in $d$ variables
has the stable division property if it has a generating set $\{f_1, ..., f_k\}$
such that every $h \in M$ can be written as $h = \sum_i a_i f_i$ for some
polynomials $a_i$ such that $\sum \|a_i f_i\| \leq C\|h\|$. We show that
certain classes of modules have this property, and that the stable
decomposition $h = \sum a_i f_i$ may be obtained by carefully applying
techniques from computational algebra. We show that when the algebra of
polynomials in $d$ variables is given the natural $\ell^1$ norm, then every
ideal is linearly equivalent to an ideal that has the stable division property.
We then show that a module $M$ that has the stable division property (with
respect to the appropriate norm) is $p$-essentially normal for $p > \dim(M)$,
as conjectured by Douglas. This result is used to give a new, unified proof
that certain classes of graded submodules are essentially normal. Finally, we
reduce the problem of determining whether all graded submodules of the
$d$-shift Hilbert module are essentially normal, to the problem of determining
whether all ideals generated by quadratic scalar valued polynomials are
essentially normal.

Reconstructed source positions were then compared against the most accurate
positions available, determined from focusing X-ray telescopes. Since the PSLA
is a strong function of source detection significance, the offsets from true

the field of polarization measurements of astrophysical X-rays. Recently, a
proposal has been submitted to ISRO for a dedicated small satellite based

the first X-ray polarization measurements since 1976. This experiment will be
based on the well known principle of polarization measurement by Thomson
scattering and employs the baseline design of a central low Z scatterer
surrounded by X-ray detectors to measure the angular intensity distribution of
the scattered X-rays. The sensitivity of such experiment is determined by the
collecting area, scattering and detection efficiency, X-ray detector
background, and the modulation factor. Therefore, it is necessary to carefully

the full-potential linearized augmented-plane-wave (FLAPW) method. The
Hartree-Fock exchange term, which is a central ingredient of hybrid
functionals, gives rise to a computationally expensive nonlocal potential in
the one-particle Schroedinger equation. The matrix elements of this exchange
potential are calculated with the help of an auxiliary basis that is
constructed from products of FLAPW basis functions. By representing the Coulomb
interaction in this basis the nonlocal exchange term becomes a Brillouin-zone
(BZ) sum over vector-matrix-vector products. We show that the Coulomb matrix
can be made sparse by a suitable unitary transformation of the auxiliary basis,
which accelerates the computation of the vector-matrix-vector products
considerably. Additionally, we exploit spatial and time-reversal symmetry to
identify the nonvanishing exchange matrix elements in advance and to restrict
the k summations for the nonlocal potential to an irreducible set of k points.
Favorable convergence of the self-consistent-field cycle is achieved by a
nested density-only and density-matrix iteration scheme. We discuss the
convergence with respect to the parameters of our numerical scheme and show
results for a variety of semiconductors and insulators, including oxide
materials, where the PBE0 hybrid functional improves the band gaps and the
description of localized states in comparison with the PBE functional.
Furthermore, we find that in contrast to conventional local
exchange-correlation functionals ferromagnetic EuO is correctly predicted to be
a semiconductor.

near-surface effects of sunspots on solar waves, which are dominant. Here we
construct simplified, cylindrically-symmetric sunspot models, which are
designed to capture the magnetic and thermodynamics effects coming from about
500 km below the quiet-Sun $\tau_{5000}=1$ level to the lower chromosphere. We
use a combination of existing semi-empirical models of sunspot thermodynamic
structure (density, temperature, pressure): the umbral model of Maltby et al.
(1986) and the penumbral model of Ding and Fang (1989). The OPAL equation of
state tables are used to derive the sound speed profile. We smoothly merge the
near-surface properties to the quiet-Sun values about 1mm below the surface.
The umbral and penumbral radii are free parameters. The magnetic field is added
to the thermodynamic structure, without requiring magnetostatic equilibrium.
The vertical component of the magnetic field is assumed to have a Gaussian
horizontal profile, with a maximum surface field strength fixed by surface
observations. The full magnetic field vector is solenoidal and determined by
the on-axis vertical field, which, at the surface, is chosen such that the
field inclination is 45$^\circ$ at the umbral-penumbral boundary. We construct
a particular sunspot model based on SOHO/MDI observations of the sunspot in
active region NOAA 9787. The helioseismic signature of the model sunspot is
studied using numerical simulations of the propagation of f, p$_1$, and p$_2$
wave packets. These simulations are compared against cross-covariances of the
observed wave field. We find that the sunspot model gives a helioseismic

when describing physical quantities. Its implementation amounts to treating
Weyl invariance as a fundamental symmetry of all physical theories. In this
thesis, we study the consequences of this ""unit invariance"" principle and find
that it is a unifying one. Unit invariance is achieved by introducing a gauge
field called the scale, designed to measure how unit systems vary from point to
point. In fact, by a uniform and simple Weyl invariant coupling of scale and
matter fields, we unify massless, massive, and partially massless excitations.
As a consequence, masses now dictate the response of physical quantities to
changes of scale. This response is calibrated by certain ""tractor Weyl
weights"". Reality of these weights yield Breitenlohner-Freedman stability
bounds in anti de Sitter spaces. Another valuable outcome of our approach is a
general mechanism for constructing conformally invariant theories. In
particular, we provide direct derivations of the novel Weyl invariant
Deser--Nepomechie vector and spin three-half theories as well as new higher
spin generalizations thereof. To construct these theories, a ""tractor calculus""
coming from conformal geometry is employed, which keeps manifest Weyl
invariance at all stages. In fact, our approach replaces the usual Riemannian
geometry description of physics with a conformal geometry one. Within the same

  Aims: We investigate the long-term stability of atmospheric lines as a

atmospheric and observing conditions.
  Methods: We use HARPS archive data on three bright stars, Tau Ceti, Mu Arae
and Epsilon Eri, spanning 6 years and containing high-cadence measurements over
several nights. We cross-correlate this data with an O2 mask and evaluate both
radial velocity and bisector variations down to a photon noise of 1 m/s.
  Results: We find that the telluric lines in the three data-sets are stable

discriminated by the shift of the NMR resonance, leading to a small line
splitting, which hardly depends on temperature or susceptibility. The smallness
of the effect is additional evidence for the location of the holes as deduced
by Schussler-Langenheine et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 156402 (2005). The
increase in linewidth with decreasing temperature shows a local field
redistribution, consistent with the formation of charge density waves or
stripes. For comparison, we studied in particular the grandmother of all planar
antiferromagnets K2NiF in the paramagnetic state using natural abundant 61Ni.
The hyperfine fields in both 2-dimensional compounds appear to be remarkably
small, which is well explained by super(transferred) hyperfine interaction. In
K2NiF4 the temperature dependence of the susceptibility and Knight shift cannot
be brought onto a simple scaling curve. This unique feature is ascribed to a
different sensitivity for correlations of these two parameters.

film of the Fe-based superconductor BaFe$_{1.84}$Co$_{0.16}$As$_2$ with
T$_c$=22.5 K. The film was grown by pulsed laser deposition on a DyScO$_3$
substrate with an epitaxial SrTiO$_3$ intermediate layer. The measured
$R_S/R_N$ spectrum, i.e. the reflectivity ratio between the superconducting and
normal state reflectance, provides clear evidence of a superconducting gap
$\Delta_A$ close to 15 cm$^{-1}$. A detailed data analysis shows that a
two-band, two-gap model is absolutely necessary to obtain a good description of
the measured $R_S/R_N$ spectrum. The low-energy $\Delta_A$ gap results to be
well determined ($\Delta_A$=15.5$\pm$0.5 cm$^{-1}$), while the value of the
high-energy gap $\Delta_B$ is more uncertain ($\Delta_B$=55$\pm$7 cm$^{-1}$).
Our results provide evidence of a nodeless isotropic double-gap scenario, with
the presence of two optical gaps corresponding to 2$\Delta/kT_c$ values close
to 2 and 7.

Submitted to A&A",,"10.1051/0004-6361/201014344",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We investigate the constraints imposed on the luminosity function (LF) of
long duration Gamma Ray Bursts (LGRBs) by the flux distribution of bursts
detected by the GBM at ~1 MeV, and the implications of the non detection of the
vast majority, ~95%, of the LGRBs at higher energy, ~1 GeV, by the LAT
detector. We find a LF that is consistent with those determined by BATSE and
Swift. The non detections by LAT set upper limits on the ratio R of the prompt
fluence at ~1 GeV to that at ~1 MeV. The upper limits are more stringent for
brighter bursts, with R<{0.1,0.3,1} for {5,30,60}% of the bursts. This implies
that for most bursts the prompt ~1 GeV emission may be comparable to the ~1 MeV
emission, but can not dominate it. The value of R is not universal, with a
spread of (at least) an order of magnitude around R~10^(-1). For several bright
bursts with reliable determination of the photon spectral index at ~1 MeV, the
LAT non detection implies an upper limit to the ~100 MeV flux which is <0.1 of
the flux obtained by extrapolating the ~1 MeV flux to high energy. For the
widely accepted models, in which the ~1 MeV power-law photon spectrum reflects
the power-law energy distribution of fast cooling electrons, this suggests that
either the electron energy distribution does not follow a power-law over a wide
energy range, or that the high energy photons are absorbed. Requiring an order
unity pair production optical depth at ~100 MeV sets an upper limit for the
Lorentz factor, Gamma<=10^(2.5).

observation that if gravitational waves propagating in a cosmological
environment encounter even a small magnetic field then electromagnetic
radiation is produced. To study this phenomenon in more detail we take it out
of the cosmological context and at the same time simplify the gravitational
radiation to impulsive waves. Specifically, to illustrate our findings, we
describe the following three physical situations: (1) a cylindrical impulsive
gravitational wave propagating into a universe with a magnetic field, (2) an
axially symmetric impulsive gravitational wave propagating into a universe with
an electric field and (3) a `spherical' impulsive gravitational wave
propagating into a universe with a small magnetic field. In cases (1) and (3)
electromagnetic radiation is produced behind the gravitational wave. In case
(2) no electromagnetic radiation appears after the wave unless a current is
established behind the wave breaking the Maxwell vacuum. In all three cases the
presence of the magnetic or electric fields results in a modification of the
amplitude of the incoming gravitational wave which is explicitly calculated
using the Einstein--Maxwell vacuum field equations.

We study the Weyl equation in the stationary setting, i.e. when the the spinor

interpretation of the stationary Weyl equation, one which does not require the
use of spinors, Pauli matrices or covariant differentiation. We think of our
3-dimensional space as an elastic continuum and assume that material points of
this continuum can experience no displacements, only rotations. This framework
is a special case of the Cosserat theory of elasticity. Rotations of material
points of the space continuum are described mathematically by attaching to each
geometric point an orthonormal basis which gives a field of orthonormal bases
called the coframe. As the dynamical variables (unknowns) of our theory we
choose the coframe and a density. We choose a particular potential energy which
is conformally invariant and then incorporate time into our action in the
standard Newtonian way, by subtracting kinetic energy. The main result of our
paper is the theorem stating that in the stationary setting our model is
equivalent to a pair of Weyl equations. The crucial element of the proof is the
observation that our Lagrangian admits a factorisation.

reduces cooling flows at the kpc scale. Including both types of feedback with

~10^{-1.3} respectively, produces systems having duty-cycles, central SMBH

with the broad suite of modern observations of massive elliptical systems. Our
main conclusion is that mechanical feedback (including all three of energy,

independent arguments must be a factor of 10 lower than is commonly assumed.
Bursts are frequent at z>1 and decline in frequency towards the present epoch

surrounding medium. For a representative galaxy of final stellar mass ~3
10^{11} Msun, roughly 3 10^{10} Msun of recycled gas has been added to the ISM
since z~2 and, of that, roughly 63% has been expelled from the galaxy, 19% has
been converted into new metal rich stars in the central few hundred parsecs,
and 2% has been added to the central SMBH, with the remaining 16% in the form
hot X-ray emitting ISM. The bursts occupy a total time of ~170 Myr, which is
roughly 1.4% of the available time. Of this time, the central SMBH would be
seen as an UV or optical source for ~45% and ~71$% of the time, respectively.
Restricting to the last 8.5 Gyr, the burst occupy ~44 Myr, corresponding to a

coexisting regions of complete and partial synchrony, emerges via a
supercritical bifurcation from a homogeneous state and thus does not require
preparation of special initial conditions. We develop a theory of chimera
basing on the equations for the local complex order parameter in the
Ott-Antonsen approximation. Applying a numerical linear stability analysis, we
also describe the instability of the chimera and transition to a phase
turbulence with persistent patches of synchrony.

different types of Distributed Constraint Satisfaction Problems (DCSP). The

model is intended to be used which is an emerged field from the integration
between two paradigms of different nature: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) and the
Constraint Satisfaction Problem paradigm (CSP) where all constraints are
treated in central manner as a black-box. This model allows grouping
constraints to form a subset that will be treated together as a local problem
inside the controller. Using this model allows also handling non-binary
constraints easily and directly so that no translating of constraints into
binary ones is needed. This paper presents the implementation outlines of a
prototype of DCSP solver, its usage methodology and overview of the CACS

significantly. Two hole surfaces shrink into small ellipsoid-like surfaces and
disappear finally, at which the applied pressure is ~ 74.7 GPa. The pressure
response can be understood by the band structures around the Fermi level.
Comparative studies reveal that the disappearance of hole surfaces is mainly
due to the compression of the FeP layer along the c-axis of unit cell.

nonspinning black holes, of masses $m_1$ and $m_2$, in the extreme mass ratio
limit, $m_1 m_2\ll(m_1+m_2)^2$. The relative dynamics of the system is computed
{\it without making any adiabatic approximation} by using an effective one body
(EOB) description, namely by representing the binary by an effective particle
of mass $\mu=m_1 m_2/(m_1+m_2)$ moving in a (quasi-)Schwarzschild background of
mass $M=m_1+m_2$ and submitted to an $\O(\nu)$ 5PN-resummed analytical
radiation reaction force, with $\nu=\mu/M$. The gravitational wave emission is
calculated via a multipolar Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli type perturbative approach
(valid in the limit $\nu\ll 1$). We consider three mass ratios,
$\nu={10^{-2},10^{-3},10^{-4}}$,and we compute the multipolar waveform up to
$\ell=8$. We estimate energy and angular momentum losses during the
quasi-universal and quasi-geodesic part of the plunge phase and we analyze the
structure of the ringdown. We calculate the gravitational recoil, or ""kick"",
imparted to the merger remnant by the gravitational wave emission and we
emphasize the importance of higher multipoles to get a final value of the
recoil $v/(c\nu^2)=0.0446$. We finally show that there is an {\it excellent
fractional agreement} ($\sim 10^{-3}$) (even during the plunge) between the 5PN
EOB analytically-resummed radiation reaction flux and the numerically computed
gravitational wave angular momentum flux. This is a further confirmation of the
aptitude of the EOB formalism to accurately model extreme-mass-ratio inspirals,
as needed for the future space-based LISA gravitational wave detector.

angular momentum provides an efficient natural barrier to accretion and so only
the lowest angular momentum material will be available to feed the black holes.
The standard sub-grid model for black hole accretion in galaxy formation
simulations - based on the Bondi-Hoyle method - does not account for the
angular momentum of accreting material, and so it is unclear how representative
the black hole accretion rate estimated in this way is likely to be. In this
paper we introduce a new sub-grid model for black hole accretion that naturally
accounts for the angular momentum of accreting material. Both the black hole
and its accretion disc are modelled as a composite accretion disc particle. Gas
particles are captured by the accretion disc particle if and only if their
orbits bring them within its accretion radius R_acc, at which point their mass
is added to the accretion disc and feeds the black hole on a viscous timescale
t_visc. The resulting black hole accretion rate (dM/dt)_BH powers the accretion
luminosity L_acc ~ (dM/dt)_BH, which drives black hole feedback. Using a series
of controlled numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our new accretion disc
particle method is more physically self-consistent than the Bondi-Hoyle method.
We also discuss the physical implications of the accretion disc particle method
for systems with a high degree of rotational support, and we argue that the
M_BH-sigma relation in these systems should be offset from the relation for
classical bulges and ellipticals, as appears to be observed.

straightforward application to molecules fails: optical pumping can lead the

off-resonant regime generates only very slow cooling due to the reduced
field-molecule coupling. We predict to overcome this by using a strongly driven
ring-cavity operated in the sideband cooling regime. As in the optomechanical
setups one takes advantage of a collectively enhanced field-molecule coupling
strength using a large photon number. A linearized analytical treatment
confirmed by full numerical quantum simulations predicts fast cooling despite
the off-resonant small single molecule - single photon coupling. Even ground

that they correspond bijectively to certain regular Fell bundles over inverse
semigroups, yielding in this way a structure classification of such bundles.
These include as special cases all the stable Fell bundles.
  Our definition of twisted actions properly generalizes a previous one
introduced by Sieben and corresponds to Busby-Smith twisted actions in the
group case. As an application we describe twisted etale groupoid C*-algebras in
terms of crossed products by twisted actions of inverse semigroups and show
that Sieben's twisted actions essentially correspond to twisted etale groupoids
with topologically trivial twists.

employing quntum field theory in curved spacetime, we explicitly calculate the

particles in a Casimir apparatus. It is shown that, as expected from the
proposed conjecture, both the frequency and renormalized energy of the virtual

conjecture. Generalizations to weak {\it stationary} spacetimes and virtual

calculated in the coupled-channels approach. The calculations include couplings
between the 3/2$^-$, 5/2$^-$, and 7/2$^-$ states in the $K=3/2$ ground state
rotational band of $^9$Be. It is shown that the $B(E2)$ values for the
excitation of these states are accurately described in the rotor model. The
interaction of the strongly deformed $^9$Be nucleus with a spherical target is
calculated using the double-folding technique and the effective M3Y
interaction, which is supplemented with a repulsive term that is adjusted to
optimize the fit to the data for the $^{144}$Sm target. The complete fusion is
described by in-going-wave boundary conditions. The decay of the unbound
excited states in $^9$Be is considered explicitly in the calculations by using
complex excitation energies. The model gives an excellent account of the
complete fusion (CF) data for $^9$Be+$^{144}$Sm, and the cross sections for the
decay of the excited states are in surprisingly good agreement with the
incomplete fusion (ICF) data. Similar calculations for $^9$Be+$^{208}$Pb
explain the total fusion data at high energies but fail to explain the CF data,
which are suppressed by 20%, and the calculated cross section for the decay of
excited states is a factor of three smaller than the ICF data at high energies.
Possible reasons for these discrepancies are discussed.

inequality in the case of infinitely many outcomes. Like in the case of
Tsirelson's inequality the proof of our new inequality does not require any
assumptions on the dimension of the Hilbert space or kinds of operators
involved. However, it is seen that the maximal violation is obtained by the
conjectured best measurements and a pure, but not maximally entangled, state.
We give an approximate state which, in the limit where the number of outcomes
tends to infinity, goes to the optimal state for this setting. This state might
be potentially relevant for experimental verifications of Bell inequalities
through multi-dimenisonal entangled photon pairs.

it is imperative to have a good overview of both the differences and
similarities between normal B stars and the Be stars. Here we investigate a
previous report that there may be a large population of sub-arcsecond
companions to Be stars. We present the first systematic, comparative imaging
study of the binary properties of matched samples of B and Be stars observed
using the same equipment. We obtained high angular resolution (0.07-0.1 arcsec)
K band Adaptive Optics data of 40 B stars and 39 Be stars. The separations that
can be probed range from 0.1 to 8 arcsec (corresponding to 20-1000 AU), and
magnitude differences up to 10 magnitudes can in principle be covered. We
detect 11 binaries out of 37 Be targets (corresponding to a binary fraction of
30 +/- 8%) and 10 binaries out of 36 B targets (29 +/- 8%). Further tests
demonstrate that the B and Be binary systems are not only similar in frequency
but also remarkably similar in terms of binary separations, flux differences
and mass ratios. We find that any hypotheses invoking binary companions as
responsible for the formation of a disk need the companions to be closer than
20 AU. Close companions are known to affect the circumstellar disks of Be
stars, but as not all Be stars have been found to be close binaries, the data
suggest that binarity can not be responsible for the Be phenomenon in all Be
stars. Finally, the similarities of the binary parameters themselves also shed
light on the Be formation mechanism. They strongly suggest that the initial
conditions that gave rise to B and Be star formation must, to all intents and
purposes, be similar. This in turn indicates that the Be phenomenon is not the
result of a different star formation mechanism.

(4,3) and (5,3) AuNTs carry transverse momenta of similar magnitudes, the
low-bias magnetic flux carried by the former is far greater than that carried

nature of this theory is known to be important for physics near the
singularity, at least as far as the number of degrees of freedom is concerned.
We will show that the quartic interaction is always subleading as one
approaches the singularity and that close enough to t=0 the evolution is driven
by the diverging tachyonic mass term. The evolution towards asymptotically flat
space-time also reveals some surprising features.
