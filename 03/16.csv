optical mode of a zero dimensional nanocavity by quantum dot multiexciton
transitions. Power dependent photoluminescence measurements reveal a
super-linear power dependence of the mode emission, indicating that the
emission stems from multiexcitons. By monitoring the temporal evolution of the
photoluminescence spectrum, we observe a clear anticorrelation of the mode and
single exciton emission; the mode emission quenches as the population in the
system reduces towards the single exciton level whilst the intensity of the
mode emission tracks the multi-exciton transitions. Our results lend strong
support to a recently proposed mechanism mediating the strongly non-resonant
feeding of photons into the cavity mode.

understand also the natural environment it evolved to interpret. Unfortunately,
existing models of the visual environment are either unrealistic or too complex

present a mathematical solution for the statistical relationships between the
image features and model variables. The world described by this model is
composed of independent, opaque, textured objects which occlude each other.
This simple structure allows us to calculate the joint probability distribution
of image values sampled at multiple arbitrarily located points, without
approximation. This result can be converted into probabilistic relationships
between observable image features as well as between the unobservable
properties that caused these features, including object boundaries and relative
depth. Using these results we explain the causes of a wide range of natural
scene properties, including highly non-gaussian distributions of image features
and causal relations between pairs of edges. We discuss the implications of
this description of natural scenes for the study of vision.

nuclear interaction in regions away from saturation. In this report we present
a selection of new reaction observables in dissipative collisions particularly
sensitive to the symmetry term of the nuclear Equation of State ($Iso-EoS$). We
will first discuss the Isospin Equilibration Dynamics. At low energies this
manifests via the recently observed Dynamical Dipole Radiation, due to a
collective neutron-proton oscillation with the symmetry term acting as a
restoring force. At higher beam energies Iso-EoS effects will be seen in an
Isospin Diffusion mechanism, via Imbalance Ratio Measurements, in particular
from correlations to the total kinetic energy loss. For fragmentation reactions
in central events we suggest to look at the coupling between isospin
distillation and radial flow. In Neck Fragmentation reactions important Iso-EoS
information can be obtained from fragment isospin content, velocity and
alignement correlations. The high density symmetry term can be probed from
isospin effects on heavy ion reactions at relativistic energies (few AGeV
range), in particular for high transverse momentum selections of the reaction
products. Rather isospin sensitive observables are proposed from
nucleon/cluster emissions, collective flows and meson production. The
possibility to shed light on the controversial neutron/proton effective mass
splitting in asymmetric matter is also suggested.
  A large symmetry repulsion at high baryon density will also lead to an
""earlier"" hadron-deconfinement transition in n-rich matter. The binodal
transition line of the (T,\rho_B) diagram is lowered to a region accessible
through heavy ion collisions in the energy range of the new planned facilities,
e.g. the FAIR/NICA projects. Some observable effects of the formation of a
Mixed Phase are suggested, in particular a Neutron Trapping mechanism. The
dependence of the results on a suitable treatment of the isovector part of the
interaction in effective QCD Lagrangian approaches is critically discussed. We
stress the interest of this study in nuclear astrophysics, in particular for
supernovae explosions and neutron star structure, where the knowledge of the
Iso-EoS is important at low as well as at high baryon density.

the behavior of red clump giants - a distinct stellar population, which is
known to have an essentially constant intrinsic luminosity and color. By
studying the variation in the position of the red clump giants on a spatially
resolved color-magnitude diagram, we confirm the anomalous total-to-selective
extinction ratio, as reported in previous work for other Galactic bulge fields.
We show that the interstellar extinction in this area is <A_(F625W)>= 4 on
average, but varies significantly between ~3-5 on angular scales as small as 1
arcminute. Using the distribution of red clump giants in an
extinction-corrected color-magnitude diagram, we constrain the shape of a
stellar-mass distribution model in the direction of this ultra-deep Chandra
field, which will be used in a future analysis of the population of X-ray
sources. We also show that the adopted model for the stellar density
distribution predicts an infrared surface brightness in the direction of the
""Chandra bulge field"" in good agreement (i.e. within ~15%) with the actual
measurements derived from the Spitzer/IRAC observations.

a subject of debate after more than two decades of investigation. Here we

strength of the anomalous normal-state scattering that makes the resistivity
linear in temperature. The same correlation between linear resistivity and Tc
is found in organic superconductors, for which pairing is known to come from
fluctuations of a nearby antiferromagnetic phase, and in pnictide
superconductors, for which an antiferromagnetic scenario is also likely. In the
cuprates, the question is whether the pseudogap phase plays the corresponding
role, with its fluctuations responsible for pairing and scattering. We review
recent studies that shed light on this phase - its boundary, its quantum
critical point, and its broken symmetries. The emerging picture is that of a
phase with spin-density-wave order and fluctuations, in broad analogy with
organic, pnictide, and heavy-fermion superconductors.

a probabilistic proof of Roth's theorem on three-term arithmetic progressions

structured, in the sense that they contain very large iterated product sets.
This is particularly so when the sets in question satisfy small-doubling

in the direction of the medium age open cluster NGC 5617. Our intention is to
use polarimetry as a tool membership identification, by building on previous
investigations intended mainly to determine the cluster's general
characteristics rather than provide membership suitable for studies such as
stellar content and metallicity, as well as study the characteristics of the
dust lying between the Sun and the cluster. The obsevations were carried out
using the five-channel photopolarimeter of the Torino Astronomical Observatory
attached to the 2.15m telescope at the Complejo Astron\'omico El Leoncito
(CASLEO; Argentina. We are able to add 32 stars to the list of members of NGC
5617, and review the situation for others listed in the literature. In
particular, we find that five blue straggler stars in the region of the cluster
are located behind the same dust as the member stars are and we confirm the
membership of two red giants. The proposed polarimetric memberships are
compared with those derived by photometric and kinematical methods, with
excellent results. Among the observed stars, we identify 10 with intrinsic
polarization in their light. NGC 5617 can be polarimetrically characterized
with $P_{max}= 4.40%$ and $ \theta_{v}= 73^\circ.1$. The spread in polarization
values for the stars observed in the direction of the cluster seems to be
caused by the uneven distribution of dust in front of the cluster's face.
Finally, we find that in the direction of the cluster, the interstellar medium
is apparently free of dust, from the Sun's position up to the
Carina-Sagittarius arm, where NGC 5617 seems to be located at its farthest
border.

Theory (QFT). However, the explanations for a number of cosmological phenomena
such as inflation, dark energy, symmetry breakings, and phase transitions need
the presence of classical scalar fields. Although the process of condensation
of scalar fields in the lab is fairly well understood, the extension of results
to a cosmological context is not trivial. Here we investigate the formation of
a condensate - a classical scalar field - after reheating of the Universe. We
assume a light quantum scalar field produced by the decay of a heavy particle,
which for simplicity is assumed to be another scalar. We show that during
radiation domination epoch under certain conditions, the decay of the heavy
particle alone is sufficient for the production of a condensate. This process
is very similar to preheating - the exponential particle production at the end
of inflation. During matter domination epoch when the expansion of the Universe
is faster, the decay alone can not keep the growing trend of the field and the
amplitude of the condensate decreases rapidly, unless there is a self
interaction. This issue is particularly important for dark energy. We show that
quantum corrections of the self-interaction play a crucial role in this
process. Notably, they induce an effective action which includes inverse
power-law terms, and therefore can lead to a tracking behaviour even when the
classical self-interaction is a simple power-law of order 3 or 4. This removes
the necessity of having nonrenormalisable terms in the Lagrangian. If dark
energy is the condensate of a quantum scalar field, these results show that its
presence is deeply related to the action of quantum physics at largest
observable scales.

non-commutative generalized stochastic processes with freely independent
values, $\omega=(\omega(t))_{t\in T}$, was characterized through the continuity
of the corresponding orthogonal polynomials. In this paper, we derive a
generating function for these orthogonal polynomials. The first question we
have to answer is: What should serve as a generating function for a system of
polynomials of infinitely many non-commuting variables? We construct a class of
operator-valued functions $Z=(Z(t))_{t\in T}$ such that $Z(t)$ commutes with
$\omega(s)$ for any $s,t\in T$. Then a generating function can be understood as
$G(Z,\omega)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty
\int_{T^n}P^{(n)}(\omega(t_1),...,\omega(t_n))Z(t_1)...Z(t_n)\sigma(dt_1)...\sigma(dt_n)$,
where $P^{(n)}(\omega(t_1),...,\omega(t_n))$ is (the kernel of the) $n$-th
orthogonal polynomial. We derive an explicit form of $ G(Z,\omega)$, which has
a resolvent form and resembles the generating function in the classical case,
albeit it involves integrals of non-commuting operators. We finally discuss a
related problem of the action of the annihilation operators $\partial_t$, $t\in
T$. In contrast to the classical case, we prove that the operators $\di_t$
related to the free Gaussian and Poisson processes have a property of
globality. This result is genuinely infinite-dimensional, since in one
dimension one loses the notion of globality.

is usually merely asymptotic (i.e., it can be reached only for suitable limit

suggested the search of an alternative approach, based on the construction of a
suitable inverse kinetic theory (IKT; Tessarotto et al., 2004-2007), which can
avoid them. IKT, in fact, permits to achieve an exact representation of the

suitable (inverse) kinetic equation. The latter can be identified with a
Liouville equation advancing in time a phase-space probability density function

Indeed, in W^{s,p} (s<1+(1/p)) neighborhood of any homogeneous state, the long

homogeneous states and their possible invariant manifolds. Second, it is shown
that for homogeneous equilibria satisfying Penrose's linear stability

homogeneous states in some W^{s,p} (p>1,s>1+(1/p)) neighborhood. Furthermore,
when p=2,we prove that there exist no nontrivial invariant structures in the

suggest the long time dynamics in the W^{s,p} (s>1+(1/p)) and particularly, in

relatively simple. We also demonstrate that linear damping holds for initial

mixing inside an open-flow channel. Since the open flow continuously brings new
fluid into the limited mixing region, it is difficult to define relevant mixing
indices, as fluid particles experience typically very different stretching and
mixing histories. The repeated stretching and folding of a spot of dye leads to
a persistent pattern. We propose that the normalized standard deviation of this
characteristic pattern is a good measure of the mixing quality of the flow. We
discuss the link between this measure and mixing of continuously-injected dye,
and investigate it using an idealized map.

address the various cosmological constant problems. We first observe that the
renormalization of gravitational couplings (induced by integrating out various
matter fields) manifests non-local modifications to Einstein's equations as
quantum corrected equations of motion. That is, at the loop level, matter
sources curvature through a gravitational coupling that is a non-local function
of the covariant d'Alembertian. If the functional form of the resulting
Newton's `constant' is such that it annihilates very long wavelength sources,
but reduces to $1/M^2_{pl}$ ($M_{pl}$ being the 4d Planck mass) for all sources
with cosmologically observable wavelengths, we would have a complimentary
realization of the degravitation paradigm-- a realization through which its
non-linear completion and the corresponding modified Bianchi identities are
readily understood. We proceed to consider various theories whose coupling to
gravity may a priori induce non-trivial renormalizations of Newton's constant
in the IR, and arrive at a class of non-local effective actions which yield a
suitably degravitating filter function for Newton's constant upon subsequently
being integrated out. We motivate this class of non-local theories through
several considerations, discuss open issues, future directions, the inevitable
question of scheme dependence in semi-classical gravitational calculations and
comment on connections with other meditations in the literature on relaxing of
the cosmological constant semi-classically.

light-sheet cannot exceed a quarter of its initial area, A, in Planck units.
The gravitational entropy of black holes saturates this inequality. The entropy
of matter systems, however, falls short of saturating the bound in known
examples. This puzzling gap has led to speculation that a much stronger bound,
S< A^{3/4}, may hold true. In this note, we exhibit light-sheets whose entropy
exceeds A^{3/4} by arbitrarily large factors. In open FRW universes, such
light-sheets contain the entropy visible in the sky; in the limit of early
curvature domination, the covariant bound can be saturated but not violated. As
a corollary, we find that the maximum observable matter and radiation entropy
in universes with positive (negative) cosmological constant is of order
Lambda^{-1} (Lambda^{-2}), and not |Lambda|^{-3/4} as had hitherto been
believed. Our results strengthen the evidence for the covariant entropy bound,

test the current model of galaxy formation. Observational data have revealed a
few inconsistencies with predictions from the $\Lambda {\rm CDM}$ model. For
example, most massive galaxies have already been observed at very high
redshifts, and they have experienced only mild evolution since then. In
conflict with this, semi-analytical models of galaxy formation predict an
insufficient number of massive galaxies at high redshift and a rapid evolution
between redshift 1 and 0 . In addition, there is a strong correlation between
star formation rate and stellar mass for star-forming galaxies, which can be
roughly reproduced with the model, but with a normalization that is too low at
high redshift. Furthermore, the stellar mass density obtained from the integral
of the cosmic star formation history is higher than the measured one by a
factor of 2. In this paper, we study these issues using a semi-analytical model
that includes: 1) cold gas accretion in massive halos at high redshift; 2)
tidal stripping of stellar mass from satellite galaxies; and 3) an evolving
stellar initial mass function (bottom-light) with a higher gas recycle
fraction. Our results show that the combined effects from 1) and 2) can predict
sufficiently massive galaxies at high redshifts and reproduce their mild
evolution at low redshift, While the combined effects of 1) and 3) can
reproduce the correlation between star formation rate and stellar mass for
star-forming galaxies across wide range of redshifts. A bottom-light/top-heavy
stellar IMF could partly resolve the conflict between the stellar mass density

motivated AGN modeling techniques (reverberation mapping, maser mapping and gas

published M_BH estimates, we use 2MASS K-band imaging and GALFIT to constrain
the bulge luminosities, and hence SMBH masses. In general, we find the AGNs in
the sample host SMBHs which are spread over a wide mass range (M_BH ~ (0.1-30)

M_sun region. Using sensitive hard X-ray (2-10 keV) and mid-IR constraints we
calculate the bolometric luminosities of the AGNs (L_(Bol,AGN)) and use them to
estimate relative mass accretion rates. We use these data to calculate the
volume-average SMBH growth rate of galaxies in the local Universe and find that
the AGNs hosting SMBHs in the mass range M_BH ~ 10^6-10^7 M_sun are dominated
by optically unidentified AGNs. These relatively small SMBHs are acquiring a
significant proportion of their mass in the present-day, and are amongst the
most rapidly growing in the local Universe (SMBH mass doubling times of ~6
Gyrs). Additionally, we find tentative evidence for an increasing
volume-weighted AGN fraction with decreasing SMBH mass in the M_BH ~ 10^6-10^8

SMBHs may be missed in even the most sensitive optical surveys due to absent or
weak optical AGN signatures.

momentum and energy with the bulk states, leaving behind a finite-lifetime
surface resonance in the bulk energy band. Furthermore, the hybridization may
lead in some cases to multiplied surface state bands, in all cases retaining
the helical characteristic. Weak disorder leads to very similar effects -
surface states are pushed away from the energy bandwidth of the bulk, leaving
behind a finite-lifetime surface resonance in place of the original surface
states.

perform both statistical analyses and halo-by-halo comparisons. Our study
demonstrates that there is a good statistical agreement between the three
models used here, when operating on the same merger trees, reflecting a general
agreement in the underlying framework for semi-analytic models. We also show,
however, that various assumptions that are commonly adopted to treat gas
cooling and galaxy mergers can lead to significantly different results, at
least in some regimes. In particular, we find that the different models adopted
for gas cooling lead to similar results for mass scales comparable to that of
our own Galaxy. Significant differences, however, arise at larger mass scales.
These are largely (but not entirely) due to different treatments of the `rapid
cooling' regime, and different assumptions about the hot gas distribution. At
this mass regime, the predicted cooling rates can differ up to about one order
of magnitude, with important implications on the relative weight that these
models give to AGN feedback in order to counter-act excessive gas condensation
in relatively massive haloes at low redshift. Different assumptions in the
modelling of galaxy mergers can also result in significant differences in the
timings of mergers, with important consequences for the formation and evolution

omission of an interval of 'present' time, so that the mutual information
between close times is excluded: this renders PMI robust to superposed noise or
chaotic behaviour or graininess of data, distinguishing it from a range of
established Complexity Measures. For the logistic map we compare predicted with
measured long-time PMI data. We show that measured PMI data captures not just
the period doubling cascade but also the associated cascade of banded chaos,
without confusion by the overlayer of chaotic decoration. We find that the
standard map has apparently infinite PMI, but with well defined fractal scaling
which we can interpret in terms of the relative information codimension. Whilst
our main focus is in terms of PMI over time, we can also apply the idea to PMI
across space in spatially-extended systems as a generalisation of the notion of
ordered phases.

galaxies follow an approximately linear cumulative distribution, contrary to
what is expected for decelerating shock fronts. This has been attributed to
selection effects, or to a majority of SNRs propagating in ""free expansion"", at
constant velocity, into a tenuous ambient medium. We compile a list of 77 known
SNRs in the Magellanic Clouds (MCs), and argue that they are a fairly complete
record of the SNe that have exploded over the last ~20kyr, with most now in the
adiabatic, Sedov phase of their expansions. The roughly linear cumulative size
distribution (uniform in a differential distribution) can result from the
combination of a deceleration during this phase, a transition to a
radiation-loss-dominated phase at a radius that depends on the local gas
density, and a distribution of ambient densities varying roughly as rho^{-1}.
This explanation is supported by the observed -1 power-law distributions of
three independent tracers of density: HI column density, Halpha surface
brightness, and star formation rate from resolved stellar populations. In this
picture, the observed cutoff at r~30 pc in the SNR size distribution is due to
a minimum in the mean ambient gas density in the regions where supernovae (SNe)
explode. We show that M33 has a SNR size distribution similar to that of the
MCs, suggesting these features, and their explanation, may be universal. In a
companion paper (Maoz & Badenes 2010), we use our sample of SNRs as an
effective ""SN survey"" to calculate the SN rate and delay time distribution in
the MCs. The hypothesis that most SNRs are in free expansion, rather than in
the Sedov phase of their evolution, would result in SN rates that are in strong
conflict with independent measurements, and with basic stellar evolution
theory.

supernova (SN) survey, ""conducted"" over tens of kyr, from which we derive the
current SN rate, and the SN delay time distribution (DTD), i.e., the SN rate
vs. time that would follow a hypothetical brief burst of a star formation. In
Badenes, Maoz, & Draine (2010) we have compiled a list of 77 SNRs in the MCS,
and argued it is a fairly complete record of the SNRs in the Sedov phase of
their expansions. We recover the DTD by comparing the numbers of SNRs observed
in small individual ""cells"" in these galaxies to the star-formation histories
of each cell, as calculated from resolved stellar populations by Harris &
Zaritsky. The visibility times of SNRs are the Sedov-phase lifetimes, which
depend on the local ambient densities. The local densities are estimated from
HI emission, from an inverse Schmidt law based on either Halpha flux or on the
resolved star-formation rate, and from combinations of these tracers. In the
DTD, we detect ""prompt"" type-Ia SNe (that explode within 330 Myr of star
formation) at >99% confidence level (c.l.). The best fit for the number of
prompt SNe-Ia per stellar mass formed is (2.7-11.0) x 10^{-3} /Msun, depending
on the density tracer used. The 95% c.l. range for a ""delayed"" SN Ia component
(from 330 Myr to a Hubble time) is < 1.6 x 10^{-13} SN/yr/Msun, consistent with
rate measurements in old populations. The current total (core-collapse+Ia) SN
rate in the MCs is 2.5-4.6 SNe per millenium (68% c.l.+systematics), or 1.7-3.1
SNuM [SNe/100 yr/10^{10}Msun], in agreement with the historical record and with
rates measured in other dwarf irregulars. Conversely, assuming the SNRs are in
free expansion, rather than in their Sedov phase, would impose on the SNRs a
maximum age of 6 kyr, and would imply a MC SN rate per unit mass that is 5
times higher than in any type of galaxy.

the stellar core, within the optically-thick first hydrostatic core, is
comparable to the binding energy of the disc-like first core. This heats the
inner regions of the disc, drives a shock wave through the disc, dramatically
decreases the accretion rate on to the stellar core, and launches a temporary
bipolar outflow perpendicular to the rotation axis that travels in excess of 50
AU into the infalling envelope. This outburst may assist the young protostar in
launching a conventional magnetic jet. Furthermore, if these events are cyclic,
they may provide a mechanism for intense bursts of accretion separated by long
periods of relatively quiescent accretion which can potentially solve both the
protostellar luminosity problem and the apparent age spread of stars in young
clusters. Such outbursts may also provide a formation mechanism for the
chondrules found in meteorites, with the outflow transporting them to large
distances in the circumstellar disc.

unsupervised clustering technique, known as Superparamagnetic Clustering, over
a set of morphological measurements regarding four major neuronal categories.

coherence between the obtained clusters and the original categories; and (ii)
we verify for eventual subclusters inside each of these categories. We report a
good agreement between the obtained clusters and the original categories, as
well as the identification of a relatively complex structure of subclusters in

  Annual IEEE Conference on Computational Complexity (CCC '10), June 2010",,,,"cs.CC cs.DM math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The last decade has seen a revival of interest in pebble games in the context
of proof complexity. Pebbling has proven a useful tool for studying
resolution-based proof systems when comparing the strength of different
subsystems, showing bounds on proof space, and establishing size-space
trade-offs. The typical approach has been to encode the pebble game played on a
graph as a CNF formula and then argue that proofs of this formula must inherit
(various aspects of) the pebbling properties of the underlying graph.
Unfortunately, the reductions used here are not tight. To simulate resolution
proofs by pebblings, the full strength of nondeterministic black-white pebbling
is needed, whereas resolution is only known to be able to simulate
deterministic black pebbling. To obtain strong results, one therefore needs to
find specific graph families which either have essentially the same properties
for black and black-white pebbling (not at all true in general) or which admit
simulations of black-white pebblings in resolution. This paper contributes to
both these approaches. First, we design a restricted form of black-white
pebbling that can be simulated in resolution and show that there are graph
families for which such restricted pebblings can be asymptotically better than
black pebblings. This proves that, perhaps somewhat unexpectedly, resolution
can strictly beat black-only pebbling, and in particular that the space lower
bounds on pebbling formulas in [Ben-Sasson and Nordstrom 2008] are tight.
Second, we present a versatile parametrized graph family with essentially the
same properties for black and black-white pebbling, which gives sharp
simultaneous trade-offs for black and black-white pebbling for various
parameter settings. Both of our contributions have been instrumental in
obtaining the time-space trade-off results for resolution-based proof systems
in [Ben-Sasson and Nordstrom 2009].

central AGN driven jets in a dynamic, cosmologically evolved galaxy cluster.
Extending previous work, we study jet powers ranging from L_jet = 10^44 erg/s
to L_jet = 10^46 erg/s and in duration from 30 Myr to 200 Myr. We find that
large-scale motions of cluster gas disrupt the AGN jets, causing energy to be
distributed throughout the centre of the cluster, rather than confined to a
narrow angle around the jet axis. Disruption of the jet also leads to the
appearance of multiple disconnected X-ray bubbles from a long-duration AGN with
a constant luminosity. This implies that observations of multiple bubbles in a
cluster are not necessarily an expression of the AGN duty cycle. We find that
the ""sphere of influence"" of the AGN, the radial scale within which the cluster
is strongly affected by the jet, scales as R ~ L_jet^(1/3). Increasing the
duration of AGN activity does not increase the radius affected by the AGN
significantly, but does change the magnitude of the AGN's effects. How an AGN
delivers energy to a cluster will determine where that energy is deposited: a
high luminosity is needed to heat material outside the core of the cluster,
while a low-luminosity, long-duration AGN is more efficient at heating the
inner few tens of kpc.

U-band photometric and 3350A-9260A spectroscopic observations were obtained
during 1.3 hours of the flare decay. The event persisted for more than 7 hours

quiescent state. The properties of this flare mark it as one of the most
energetic and longest-lasting white light flares ever to be observed on an
isolated low-mass star. We present the U-band flare energetics and a flare
continuum analysis. For the first time, we show convincingly with spectra that
the shape of the blue continuum from 3350A to 4800A can be represented as a sum
of two components: a Balmer continuum as predicted by the Allred et al
radiative hydrodynamic flare models and a T ~ 10,000K blackbody emission
component as suggested by many previous studies of the broadband colors and
spectral distributions of flares. The areal coverage of the Balmer continuum

continuum emitting region always being significantly (~3-16 times) larger.

problem in the frame of time-harmonic Maxwell systems without TE or TM

utilizing the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of a quasi-periodic

complex neural networks, such as the mammalian cerebral cortex, is the
existence of stable regimes of network activation, typically arising from a
limited parameter range. In this range of limited sustained activity (LSA), the
activity of neural populations in the network persists between the extremes of
either quickly dying out or activating the whole network. Hierarchical modular
networks were previously found to show a wider parameter range for LSA than
random or small-world networks not possessing hierarchical organization or
multiple modules. Here we explored how variation in the number of hierarchical
levels and modules per level influenced network dynamics and occurrence of LSA.
We tested hierarchical configurations of different network sizes, approximating
the large-scale networks linking cortical columns in one hemisphere of the rat,
cat, or macaque monkey brain. Scaling of the network size affected the number
of hierarchical levels and modules in the optimal networks, also depending on
whether global edge density or the numbers of connections per node were kept
constant. For constant edge density, only few network configurations,
possessing an intermediate number of levels and a large number of modules, led
to a large range of LSA independent of brain size. For a constant number of
node connections, there was a trend for optimal configurations in larger-size
networks to possess a larger number of hierarchical levels or more modules.
These results may help to explain the trend to greater network complexity
apparent in larger brains and may indicate that this complexity is required for
maintaining stable levels of neural activation.

in the presence of channel impairments. We derive analytical expressions for
the node isolation probability in an adhoc network in the presence of
Nakagami-m fading with superimposed lognormal shadowing. The node isolation
probability is the probability that a randomly chosen node is not able to
communicate with none of the other nodes in the network. An extensive
investigation into the impact of path loss exponent, lognormal shadowing,
Nakagami fading severity index, node density, and diversity order on the node
isolation probability is conducted. The presented results are beneficial for
the practical design of ad hoc networks.

perform a stateless and efficient routing. To enable position-based routing, a
node must be able to discover the location of the messages' destination node.
This task is typically accomplished by a location service. Recently, several
location service protocols have been developed for ad hoc networks. In this
paper we propose a novel location service called PHLS: Predictive Hierarchical
Location Service. In PHLS, the entire network is partitioned into a hierarchy
of smaller and smaller regions. For each node, one node in each-level region of
the hierarchy is chosen as its local location server. When the network
initializes or when a node attaches the network, nodes contact their local
location server with their current location information (ie. position and
velocity). Then, they only need to update their location server when they move
away from their current region. Finally, nodes query their location servers and
get the exact or predicted location of destination nodes.

distribution over activation barrier energies for enzymatic/protein reactions
is revealed. We consider an enzyme solution as an ensemble of individual
molecules with different values of the activation barrier energy described by
the distribution. From the solvent viscosity effect on the preexponent we
derive the integral equation for the distribution and find its approximate
solution. Our approach enables us to attain a twofold purpose. On the one hand
it yields a simple interpretation of the solvent viscosity dependence for
enzymatic/protein reactions that requires neither a modification of the
Kramers' theory nor that of the Stokes law. On the other hand our approach
enables us to deduce the form of the distribution over activation barrier
energies. The obtained function has a familiar bell-shaped form and is in
qualitative agreement with the results of single enzyme kinetics measurements.
General formalism is exemplified by the analysis of literature experimental
data.

originate from the inter-conversion between adjacent four and five coordinated
water molecules in supercooled liquid water, resulting in the migration of the
coordination number five in a string-like fashion, creating rotational jumps
along the way. The length of the connected events increases with lowering
temperature. Each propagation event is terminated by a 3-coordinated species,
present in a small number at large supercooling, which interacts cooperatively
with 5-coordinated molecules to annihilate both the species. We find that these
growing dynamical correlations manifest in a divergent-like growth of a
non-linear density response function, \times4(t), which is given by a four
point time correlation function (FPTCF). The locus of the maximum of
\times4(t), when plotted against the time t* of maximum, exhibits a sharp peak
precisely at the temperature where the static response functions (specific
heat, isothermal compressibility) also show similar sharp, divergent-like,
peak. While the decay of population fluctuation time correlation function of
both 4- and 5- coordinated species slows down dramatically and a step-like
feature of the relaxation becomes evident, the lifetime itself of 5-corrdinated
species remains short. These results suggest a new molecular mechanism of low

dynamics of entangled states encoded into a two-atom system interacting with a
broadband squeezed vacuum field. We illustrate our considerations by examining
the transient spectrum of the field emitted by two systems, the small sample
(Dicke) and the spatially extended (non-Dicke) models. It is found that the
shape of the spectral components depends crucially on the relative phase
between the initial entangled state and the squeezed field. We follow the
temporal evolution of the spectrum and show that depending on the relative
phase a hole burning can occur in one of the two spectral lines. We compare the
transient behavior of the spectrum with the time evolution of the initial
entanglement and find that the hole burning can be interpreted as a
manifestation of the phenomenon of entanglement sudden death. In addition, we
find that in the case of the non-Dicke model, the collective damping rate may
act like an artificial tweezer that rotates the phase of the squeezed field.

crystalline silicate forsterite in AGB stars surrounded by a thick shell of

stars we obtain the forsterite abundance of their dust shells.
  Methods. We use a monte carlo radiative transfer code to calculate infrared
spectra of dust enshrouded AGB stars. We vary the dust composition, mass-loss
rate and outer radius. We focus on the strength of the 11.3 and the 33.6 \mu m
forsterite bands, that probe the most recent (11.3 \mu m) and older (33.6 \mu
m) mass-loss history of the star. Simple diagnostic diagrams are derived,
allowing direct comparison to observed band strengths.
  Results. Our analysis shows that the 11.3 \mu m forsterite band is a robust
indicator for the forsterite abundance of the current mass-loss period for AGB
stars with an optically thick dust shell. The 33.6 \mu m band of forsterite is
sensitive to changes in the density and the geometry of the emitting dust
shell, and so a less robust indicator. Applying our method to six high
mass-loss rate AGB stars shows that AGB stars can have forsterite abundances of
12% by mass and higher, which is more than the previously found maximum
abundance of 5%.

We present the results of the modelling of HI observations of 8 HI-rich,

Most systems display HI velocity dispersions of 6.5 to 7.5 km s$^{-1}$ and all
except one show radial structure. There is an increase in the mean HI velocity
dispersion with maximum rotation velocity, at least up to 120 km s$^{-1}$. Next
we analyse the observations to derive the radial variation of the thickness
(flaring) of the HI layer. We find that with the exception of the asymmetric
IC5052, all of the galaxies in our sample are good candidates for 3D mass
modelling to measure the dark halo shape. The flaring profiles are symmetric
and have a common shape, increasing linearly inside the stellar disks and
exponential outside where the gravitational potential is dominated by the dark
halo. In the best example, UGC7321, we find in the inner regions small
deviations from the midplane and accompanying increases in thickness of the HI
layer that are possibly a result of perturbations by a relatively strong bar.

important channel for the formation of local galaxies, as suggested by recent
spatially-resolved kinematic observations of z~2 galaxies. I study the
kinematics of clumpy galaxies at z~0.6, and compare their properties with those
of counterparts at higher and lower redshifts. I selected a sample of 11 clumpy
galaxies at z~0.6 from the representative sample of emission line,
intermediate-mass galaxies IMAGES. Selection was based on rest-frame UV
morphology from HST/ACS images, mimicking the selection criteria commonly used
at higher redshifts. Their spatially-resolved kinematics were derived in the
frame of the IMAGES survey, using the VLT/FLAMES-GIRAFFE multi-integral field
spectrograph. For those showing large-scale rotation, I derived the Toomre Q
parameter, which characterizes the stability of their gaseous and stellar
phases. I find that the fraction of UV-selected clumpy galaxies at z~0.6 is
20+/-12%. Roughly half of them (45+/-30%) have complex kinematics inconsistent
with Jeans-unstable disks, while those in the remaining half (55+/-30%) show
large-scale rotations. The latter reveal a stable gaseous phase, but the
contribution of their stellar phase makes them globally unstable to clump
formation. Clumpy galaxies appear to be less unstable at z~0.6 than at z~2,
which could explain why the UV clumps tend to vanish in rest-frame optical
images of z~0.6 clumpy galaxies, conversely to z~2 clumpy galaxies, in which
the stellar phase can substantially fragment. This suggests that the former
correspond to patchy star-formation regions superimposed on a smoother mass
distribution. A possible and widespread scenario for driving clump formation
relies on instabilities by cold streams penetrating the dark matter halos where
clumpy galaxies inhabit. While such a gas accretion process is predicted to be
significant in massive, z~2 haloes, it is also predicted to be strongly
suppressed in similar, z~0.6 haloes, which could explain why lowest-z clumpy
galaxies appear to be driven by a different mechanism. Instead, I found that
interactions are probably the dominant driver leading to the formation of
clumpy galaxies at z<1. I argue that the nature of z>1 clumpy galaxies remains
more uncertain. While cold flows could be an important driver at z~2, I also
argue that the observed and cumulative merger fraction between z=2 and z=3 is
large enough so that every z~2 galaxy might be the result of a merger that
occurred within their past 1 Gyr. I conclude that it is premature to rule out
mergers as a universal driver for galaxy evolution from z~2 down to z=0.

sources (EMRIs) we will be given the opportunity to check our theoretical
expectations regarding the nature of supermassive bodies that inhabit the
central regions of galaxies. We have explored some qualitatively new features
that a perturbed Kerr metric induces in its geodesic orbits. Since a generic
perturbed Kerr metric does not possess all the special symmetries of a Kerr
metric, the geodesic equations in the former case are described by a slightly
nonintegrable Hamiltonian system. According to the Poincar\'{e}-Birkhoff
theorem this causes the appearance of the so-called Birkhoff chains of islands
on the corresponding surfaces of section in between the anticipated KAM curves
of the integrable Kerr case, whenever the intrinsic frequencies of the system
are at resonance. The chains of islands are characterized by finite width, i.e.
there is a finite range of initial conditions that correspond to a particular
resonance and consequently to a constant rational ratio of intrinsic
frequencies. Thus while the EMRI changes adiabatically by radiating energy and
angular momentum, by monitoring the frequencies of a signal we can look for a
transient pattern, in the form of a plateau, in the evolution of their ratio.
We have shown that such a plateau is anticipated to be apparent in a quite
large fraction of possible orbital characteristics if the central gravitating
source is not a Kerr black hole. Moreover the plateau in the ratio of
frequencies is expected to be more prominent at specific rational values that
correspond to the strongest resonances. This gives a possible observational
detection of such non-Kerr exotic objects.

random walk $X_n$ ($n = 1,2,...$) which is repelled or attracted by the centre
of mass $G_n = n^{-1} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i$ of its previous trajectory. The walk's
trajectory $(X_1,...,X_n)$ models a random polymer chain in either poor or good
solvent. In addition to some natural regularity conditions, we assume that the
walk has one-step mean drift directed either towards or away from its current
centre of mass $G_n$ and of magnitude $\| X_n - G_n \|^{-\beta}$ for $\beta
\geq 0$. When $\beta <1$ and the radial drift is outwards, we show that $X_n$
is transient with a limiting (random) direction and satisfies a super-diffusive
law of large numbers: $n^{-1/(1+\beta)} X_n$ converges almost surely to some
random vector. When $\beta \in (0,1)$ there is sub-ballistic rate of escape.
For $\beta \geq 0$ we give almost-sure bounds on the norms $\|X_n\|$, which in
the context of the polymer model reveal extended and collapsed phases. Analysis
of the random walk, and in particular of $X_n - G_n$, leads to the study of
real-valued time-inhomogeneous non-Markov processes $Z_n$ on $[0,\infty)$ with
mean drifts at $x$ given approximately by $\rho x^{-\beta} - (x/n)$, where
$\beta \geq 0$ and $\rho \in \R$. The study of such processes is a
time-dependent variation on a classical problem of Lamperti; moreover, they
arise naturally in the context of the distance of simple random walk on $\Z^d$
from its centre of mass, for which we also give an apparently new result. We
give a recurrence classification and asymptotic theory for processes $Z_n$ just
described, which enables us to deduce the complete recurrence classification
(for any $\beta \geq 0$) of $X_n - G_n$ for our self-interacting walk.

those into two-body final states considered in previous analysis. As a result,
the computation of the relic density is modified and the viable regions of the
model are displaced. After obtaining the genuine viable regions for different

higgs dark matter and find it to be up to two orders of magnitude smaller than
what is obtained for two-body final states only. Other implications of these
results, including the modification to the decay width of the higgs and to the
indirect detection signatures of inert higgs dark matter, are also briefly
considered. We demonstrate, therefore, that the annihilation into three-body

two short pulses having carrier frequencies, respectively, in the range of the

duration and timing of the X-ray pulse on the photoelectron energy spectra are
discussed. Analysis of the spectra obtained for very long pulses show that
certain features may be explained in terms of quantum interferences in the time

in the energy spectra separated by the infrared photon energy may appear.
Moreover, the temporal shape of the low frequency radiation field may be

12CO J=2-1 and J=1-0, 13CO J=2-1 and J=1-0, and SiO J=5-4 transitions in the
symbiotic stars R Aqr, CH Cyg, and HM Sge. The data were analyzed by means of a
simple analytical description of the general properties of molecular emission
from the inner shells around the cool star. Numerical calculations of the
expected line profiles, taking into account the level population and radiative
transfer under such conditions, were also performed. Weak emission of 12CO
J=2-1 and J=1-0 was detected in R Aqr and CH Cyg; a good line profile of 12CO
J=2-1 in R Aqr was obtained. The intensities and profile shapes of the detected
lines are compatible with emission coming from a very small shell around the
Mira-type star, with a radius comparable to or slightly smaller than the
distance to the hot dwarf companion, 10$^{14}$ - 2 10$^{14}$ cm. We argue that
other possible explanations are improbable. This region probably shows
properties similar to those characteristic of the inner shells around standard
AGB stars: outwards expansion at about 5 - 25 km/s, with a significant
acceleration of the gas, temperatures decreasing with radius between about 1000
and 500 K, and densities ~ 10$^9$ - 3 10$^8$ cm$^{-3}$. Our model calculations
are able to explain the asymmetric line shape observed in 12CO J=2-1 from R
Aqr, in which the relatively weaker red part of the profile would result from
selfabsorption by the outer layers (in the presence of a velocity increase and
a temperature decrease with radius). The mass-loss rates are somewhat larger
than in standard AGB stars, as often happens for symbiotic systems. In R Aqr,
we find that the total mass of the CO emitting region is ~ 2 - 3 10$^{-5}$ Mo,
corresponding to M' ~ 5 10$^{-6}$ - 10$^{-5}$ Mo/yr, and compatible with
results obtained from dust emission. Taking into account other existing data on
molecular emission, we suggest that the small extent of the molecule-rich gas
in symbiotic systems is mainly due to molecule photodissociation by the
radiation of the hot dwarf star.

follows a power law $\propto{A^{\tau}}$ for the mass dependence at all
colliding geometries. The power factor $\tau$ is close to -1/3 in central

system size dependence at peripheral geometries. This also suggests that in the
absence of momentum dependent interactions, Coulomb's interaction plays an
exceedingly significant role. These results are further analyzed for nuclear

properties resulting from the relativistic-like character and topological

variety of physical phenomena such as anomalous magneto-electric coupling and
Majorana excitations. Although TI surface states have been detected in Bi-based
compounds by ARPES and STM techniques, electrical control over their density,
required for most transport experiments, remains a challenge. Existing
materials are heavily doped in the bulk, thus preventing electrical tunability
of the surface states and their integration into topological quantum electronic
devices. Here we show that electronic transport in metallic Bi2Se3 nanoscale
devices can be controlled by tuning the surface density via the electric field
effect. By choosing an appropriate high-k dielectric, we are able to shift the
Fermi energy through the charge neutrality point of the surface states,
resulting in ambipolar transport characteristics reminiscent of those observed
in graphene. Combining magnetotransport, field effect, and geometry dependent
experiments, we provide transport measurements of the surface state mobility,
and identify likely scattering mechanisms by measuring its temperature
dependence.

itinerant carrier spin density in a system where those oscillations appear only
due to a finite distribution of a localized spin. The system represents a
half-infinite one-dimensional quantum wire with a magnetic impurity located at
its edge. In contrast to the conventional model of a point-like exchange
interaction the itinerant carrier spin density oscillations in this system
exist. We {\it analytically} demonstrate that when the radius of the exchange
interaction is less than the wave length of the itinerant carriers living on
the Fermi surface, the long range behavior of the oscillations is identical to
the one taking place in the zero radius limit of the same exchange interaction
but for an infinite one-dimensional quantum wire where, in comparison with the
original half-infinite system, the mass of the itinerant carriers is {\it
strongly} modified by the exchange interaction radius. On the basis of our
analysis we make a suggestion on directionality of surface
Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction shown in recent experiments: we
believe that in general the anisotropy of the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida
interaction could result not only from the anisotropy of the {\it Fermi
surface} of itinerant carriers but also from the anisotropy of the {\it spin
carrying atomic orbitals} of magnetic impurities.

infrared galaxy NGC 4418. We address the excitation of the complex molecule
HC3N to determine whether its unusually luminous emission is related to the
nature of the buried nuclear source. We use IRAM 30m and JCMT observations of
rotational and vibrational lines of HC3N to model the excitation of the
molecule by means of rotational diagrams. We report the first confirmed
extragalactic detection of vibrational lines of HC3N. We detect 6 different
rotational transitions ranging from J=10-9 to J=30-29 in the ground vibrational
state and obtain a tentative detection of the J=38-37 line. We also detect 7
rotational transitions of the vibrationally excited states v6 and v7, with
angular momenta ranging from J=10-9 to 28-27. The energies of the upper states
of the observed transitions range from 20 to 850 K. In the optically thin
regime, we find that the rotational transitions of the vibrational ground state
can be fitted for two temperatures, 30 K and 260 K, while the vibrationally
excited levels can be fitted for a rotational temperature of 90 K and a
vibrational temperature of 500 K. In the inner 300 pc of NGC 4418, we estimate
a high HC3N abundance, of the order of 10^-7. The excitation of the HC3N
molecule responds strongly to the intense radiation field and the presence of
warm, dense gas and dust at the center of NGC 4418. The intense HC3N line
emission is a result of both high abundances and excitation. The properties of
the HC3N emitting gas are similar to those found for hot cores in Sgr B2, which
implies that the nucleus (< 300 pc) of NGC 4418 is reminiscent of a hot core.
The potential presence of a compact, hot component (T=500 K) is also discussed.

the behavior of charged particles (transverse momentum pT > 0.5 GeV/c,
pseudorapidity |\eta| < 1) produced in association with large transverse
momentum jets (~2.2 fb-1) or with Drell-Yan lepton-pairs (~2.7 fb-1) in the
Z-boson mass region (70 < M(pair) < 110 GeV/c2) as measured by CDF at 1.96 TeV
center-of-mass energy. We use the direction of the lepton-pair (in Drell-Yan
production) or the leading jet (in high-pT jet production) in each event to
define three regions of \eta-\phi space; toward, away, and transverse, where
\phi is the azimuthal scattering angle. For Drell-Yan production (excluding the
leptons) both the toward and transverse regions are very sensitive to the
underlying event. In high-pT jet production the transverse region is very
sensitive to the underlying event and is separated into a MAX and MIN
transverse region, which helps separate the hard component (initial and
final-state radiation) from the beam-beam remnant and multiple parton
interaction components of the scattering. The data are corrected to the
particle level to remove detector effects and are then compared with several
QCD Monte-Carlo models. The goal of this analysis is to provide data that can
be used to test and improve the QCD Monte-Carlo models of the underlying event
that are used to simulate hadron-hadron collisions.

spacetime is not empty, it is similar to vacuum in the sense that the effective
matter satisfies an equation of state which is the generalization of $(\rho +
3p) = 0$ for ""nongravitating matter"" in 4D. In Kaluza-Klein gravity these
Schwarzschild-like metrics describe the exterior of a spherical star without
rotation. In this framework, we generalize the well-known Buchdahl's theorem
for perfect fluid spheres whose mass density does not increase outward. Without
any additional assumptions, we develop the most general expression for the
compactness limit of a star. We provide some numerical values for it, which in
principle are observationally testable and allow us to compare and contrast
different theories and exteriors. We find that in Kaluza-Klein gravity the
compactness limit of a star can be larger than 1/2, without being a black hole:
the general-relativistic upper limit $M/R < 4/9$ is increased as we go away

theoretical approach based on three variables: The Taylor deformation parameter
$\alpha_{\rm D}$, the inclination angle $\theta$, and the phase angle $\phi$ of
the membrane rotation. It is found that the dynamic phase diagram shows a
remarkable change with an increase in the ratio of the membrane shear and
bending elasticities. A fluid vesicle (no shear elasticity) exhibits three
dynamic modes: (i) Tank-treading (TT) at low viscosity $\eta_{\rm {in}}$ of
internal fluid ($\alpha_{\rm D}$ and $\theta$ relaxes to constant values), (ii)
Tumbling (TB) at high $\eta_{\rm {in}}$ ($\theta$ rotates), and (iii) Swinging
(SW) at middle $\eta_{\rm {in}}$ and high shear rate $\dot\gamma$ ($\theta$
oscillates). All of three modes are accompanied by a membrane ($\phi$)
rotation. For microcapsules with low shear elasticity, the TB phase with no
$\phi$ rotation and the coexistence phase of SW and TB motions are induced by
the energy barrier of $\phi$ rotation. Synchronization of $\phi$ rotation with
TB rotation or SW oscillation occurs with integer ratios of rotational
frequencies. At high shear elasticity, where a saddle point in the energy
potential disappears, intermediate phases vanish, and either $\phi$ or $\theta$
rotation occurs. This phase behavior agrees with recent simulation results of
microcapsules with low bending elasticity.

integer m the induced diagonal action of G is transitive on the cartesian mth
power of X with the diagonals removed. We describe three classes of affine
algebraic varieties such that their automorphism groups act infinitely
transitively on their smooth loci. The first class consists of affine cones
over flag varieties, the second of non-degenerate affine toric varieties, and
the third of iterated suspensions over affine varieties with infinitely
transitive automorphism groups of a reinforced type.

scarce resources are ubiquitous. Yet, without proper mechanisms to ensure
cooperation, the evolutionary pressure to maximize individual success tends to
create a tragedy of the commons (such as over-fishing or the destruction of our
environment). This contribution addresses a number of related puzzles of human
behavior with an evolutionary game theoretical approach as it has been
successfully used to explain the behavior of other biological species many
times, from bacteria to vertebrates. Our agent-based model distinguishes
individuals applying four different behavioral strategies: non-cooperative
individuals (""defectors""), cooperative individuals abstaining from punishment
efforts (called ""cooperators"" or ""second-order free-riders""), cooperators who
punish non-cooperative behavior (""moralists""), and defectors, who punish other
defectors despite being non-cooperative themselves (""immoralists""). By
considering spatial interactions with neighboring individuals, our model
reveals several interesting effects: First, moralists can fully eliminate
cooperators. This spreading of punishing behavior requires a segregation of
behavioral strategies and solves the ""second-order free-rider problem"". Second,
the system behavior changes its character significantly even after very long
times (""who laughs last laughs best effect""). Third, the presence of a number
of defectors can largely accelerate the victory of moralists over non-punishing
cooperators. Forth, in order to succeed, moralists may profit from immoralists
in a way that appears like an ""unholy collaboration"". Our findings suggest that
the consideration of punishment strategies allows to understand the
establishment and spreading of ""moral behavior"" by means of game-theoretical
concepts. This demonstrates that quantitative biological modeling approaches
are powerful even in domains that have been addressed with non-mathematical
concepts so far. The complex dynamics of certain social behaviors becomes
understandable as result of an evolutionary competition between different
behavioral strategies.

a charged massless minimally coupled scalar field. In a certain parameter range
these black holes suffer from well known superradiant instabilities. We
demonstrate that the end point of the resultant tachyon condensation process is
a hairy black hole which we construct analytically in a perturbative expansion
in the black hole radius. At leading order our solution is a small undeformed
RNAdS black hole immersed into a charged scalar condensate that fills the AdS
`box'. These hairy black hole solutions appear in a two parameter family
labelled by their mass and charge. Their mass is bounded from below by a
function of their charge; at the lower bound a hairy black hole reduces to a
regular horizon free soliton which can also be thought of as a nonlinear Bose
condensate. We compute the microcanonical phase diagram of our system at small
mass, and demonstrate that it exhibits a second order `phase transition'
between the RNAdS black hole and the hairy black hole phases.

shown that this volume is equal to the trace of a compact self-adjoint
operator. We provide an explicit expression for the kernel of this operator in
terms of Euler polynomials. This explicit expression makes it easy to calculate
the volume of the polytope and hence $\zeta(2n)$. In the case of odd positive
integers, the expression for the kernel enables us to rediscover an integral
representation for $\zeta(2n+1)$, obtained by a different method by
Cvijovi\'{c} and Klinowski. Finally, we indicate that the origin of the
miraculous Beukers-Kolk-Calabi change of variables in the multidimensional
integral, which is at the heart of this circle of ideas, can be traced to the
amoeba associated with the certain Laurent polynomial. The paper is dedicated
