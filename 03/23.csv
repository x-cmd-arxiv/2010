spectra in the knee region using the scenario of nuclei-photon interactions
around the acceleration sources. Young supernova remnants can be the physical
realities of such kind of CR acceleration sites. The results show that the
model can well explain the following problems simultaneously with one set of
source parameters: the knee of CR spectra and the sharpness of the knee, the
detailed irregular structures of CR spectra, the so-called ""component B"" of
Galactic CRs, and the electron/positron excesses reported by recent
observations. The coherent explanation serves as evidence that at least a
portion of CRs might be accelerated at the sources similar to young supernova
remnants, and one set of source parameters indicates that this portion mainly
comes from standard sources or from a single source.

loses it and the period decreases. If such a strong magnetic field is indeed

that some highly regarded techniques now appear to have doubtful utility.
Geomagnetic precursors have been reliable in the past and can be tested with 12
cycles of data. Of the three primary geomagnetic precursors only one (the
minimum level of geomagnetic activity) suggests a small cycle. The Sun's polar
field strength has also been used to successfully predict the last three
cycles. The current weak polar fields are indicative of a small cycle. For the
first time, dynamo models have been used to predict the size of a solar cycle
but with opposite predictions depending on the model and the data assimilation.
However, new measurements of the surface meridional flow indicate that the flow
was substantially faster on the approach to Cycle 24 minimum than at Cycle 23
minimum. In both dynamo predictions a faster meridional flow should have given
a shorter cycle 23 with stronger polar fields. This suggests that these dynamo
models are not yet ready for solar cycle prediction.

between this boosting technique and the intrinsic alignment removal via nulling
is derived. For future all-sky weak lensing surveys with photometric redshift
information the boosting technique yields statistical errors on model
parameters of intrinsic alignments whose order of magnitude is compatible with
current constraints determined from indirect measurements. Parameter biases due
to a residual cosmic shear signal are negligible in case of quasi-spectroscopic
redshifts and remain sub-dominant for typical values of the photometric
redshift scatter. We find good agreement between the performance of the
intrinsic alignment removal based on the boosting technique and standard

long-standing problems in theoretical physics. The idea of a relation between
strongly coupled gauge theories and string theory was pioneered by 't Hooft,
Wilson and Polyakov. A decade ago, Maldacena made this relation explicit by
conjecturing the exact equivalence of a conformally invariant theory in four
dimensions, the maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, with string theory
in the AdS5 x S5 background. Other examples of correspondence between a
conformally invariant theory and string theory in an AdS background were
discovered recently. The comparison of the two sides of the correspondence
requires the use of non-perturbative methods. The discovery of integrable
structures in gauge theory and string theory led to the conjecture that the two
theories are integrable for any value of the coupling constant and that they
share the same integrable structure defined non-perturbatively. The last eight
years brought remarkable progress in identifying this solvable model and in
explicitly solving the problem of computing the spectrum of conformal
dimensions of the theory. The progress came from the identification of the
dilatation operator with an integrable spin chain and from the study of the
string sigma model. In this thesis, I present the evolution of the concept of
integrability in the framework of the AdS/CFT correspondence and the the main
results obtained using this approach.

emission and the HNCO abundance with respect to H2, several authors made the
hypothesis that HNCO could be a good tracer of interstellar shocks. Here we
test this hypothesis by observing a well-known Galactic source where the
chemistry is dominated by shocks. We have observed several transitions of HNCO
towards L1157-mm and two positions (B1 and B2) in the blue lobe of the
molecular outflow. The HNCO line profiles exhibit the same characteristics of
other well-known shock tracers like CH3OH, H2CO, SO or SO2. HNCO, together with
SO2 and OCS, are the only three molecules detected so far whose emission is
much more intense in B2 than in B1, making these species valuable probes of
chemical differences along the outflow. The HNCO abundance with respect to H2
is 0.4-1.8 10^-8 in B1 and 0.3-1 10^-7 in B2. These abundances are the highest
ever measured, and imply an increment with respect to L1157-mm of a factor up
to 83, demonstrating that this molecule is actually a good shock tracer. Our
results probe that shocks can actually produce the HNCO abundance measured in
galactic nuclei and even higher ones. We propose that the gas phase abundance
of HNCO is due both to grain mantles erosion by the shock waves and by
neutral-neutral reactions in gas phase involving CN and O2. The observed
anticorrelation of CN and HNCO fluxes supports this scenario. The observed
similarities of the HNCO emission and the sulfured molecules may arise due to
formation pathways involving also O2.

the older phenomenology at hadronic colliders and favouring further specific
contacts between the theory and experimental communities. The MPI are
experiencing a growing popularity and are currently widely invoked to account
for observations that would not be explained otherwise: the activity of the
Underlying Event, the cross sections for multiple heavy flavour production, the
survival probability of large rapidity gaps in hard diffraction, etc. At the
same time, the implementation of the MPI effects in the Monte Carlo models is
quickly proceeding through an increasing level of sophistication and complexity
that in perspective achieves deep general implications for the LHC physics. The
ultimate ambition of this workshop is to promote the MPI as unification concept
between seemingly heterogeneous research lines and to profit of the complete
experimental picture in order to constrain their implementation in the models,

unitarily invariant symmetry class. The eigenvalue distribution in this model
is expressed in terms of Laguerre polynomials in the complex plane. These are
orthogonal with respect to a non-Gaussian weight including a modified Bessel
function of the second kind, and we give an elementary proof for this. In the
large $n$ limit, the eigenvalue statistics at the spectral edge close to the
real axis are described by the same family of kernels interpolating between
Airy and Poisson that was recently found by one of the authors for the elliptic
Ginibre ensemble. We conclude that this scaling limit is universal, appearing
for two different non-Hermitian random matrix ensembles with unitary symmetry.
As a second result we give an equivalent form for the interpolating Airy kernel
in terms of a single real integral, similar to representations for the
asymptotic kernel in the bulk and at the hard edge of the spectrum. This makes
its structure as a one-parameter deformation of the Airy kernel more
transparent.

fit to the existing experimental data on hyperon-separation energies but also
reproduces results of the relativistic mean field (RMF) calculations. In
addition, it can provide the Lambda($\Lambda$), Cascade-0($\Xi^0$) and
Cascade-minus ($\Xi^-$) drip lines. The existence of a range of bound

cycle. While this behaviour is easily tracked by observing the change in
surface activity a question can also be asked about what is happening beneath
the surface where the magnetic activity ultimately originates? In order to try
to answer this question we can look at the behaviour of the frequencies of the
Sun's natural seismic modes of oscillation - the p modes. These seismic
frequencies also respond to changes in activity and are probes of conditions in
the solar interior. The Birmingham Solar Oscillations Network (BiSON) has made
measurements of low-degree (low-$\ell$) p mode frequencies over the last three
solar cycles, and so is in a unique position to explore the current unusual and
extended solar minimum. We compare the frequency shifts in the low-$\ell$
p-modes obtained from the BiSON data with the change in surface activity as
measured by different proxies and show there are significant differences
especially during the declining phase of solar cycle 23 and into the current
minimum. We also observe quasi-biennial periodic behaviour in the p mode
frequencies over the last 2 cycles that, unlike in the surface measurements,
seems to be present at mid- and low-activity levels. Additionally we look at
the frequency shifts of individual $\ell$ modes.

focus on theories which have, at most, 2nd derivatives in the metric variables

their history in the central region of galaxies. In this paper, we present our
iterative technique developed to describe consistently the different stellar
com- ponents seen through emission and absorption lines. In NGC 4900 we find
many young bursts of star formation distributed along the galaxy large scale
bar on each side of the nucleus. They represent nearly 40 per cent of the
actual stellar mass in the field of view. The age for these bursts ranges from
5.5 to 8 Myr with a metallicity near and above 2 Zsun . The extinction map
gives E(B-V) values from 0.19+/-0.01 near the youngest bursts to 0.62+/-0.06 in
a dusty internal bar perpendicular to the large scale bar. The Mg 2 and Fe I
absorption lines indicate the superposition of a background stellar population
with an age between 100 Myr to 3 Gyr and a sub-solar metallicity on average. We
propose that all these episodes of star formation are the consequence of a
secular evolution. In this scenario, the galactic large scale bar plays an
important role with respect to the recent bursts and the dusty nuclear bar
observed. The iterative technique allows us to improve the determination of the
stellar population parameters, mainly an older age is obtained for the old
component and more reliable stellar population masses are found. A
composite/transition type activity in the galaxy nucleus is also revealed with
this technique.

heterogeneity in populations and affects the dynamics of pathogen spread in
such systems. We have analysed the influence of realistically complex host
morphology on the threshold for invasion and epidemic outbreak in an SIR
(susceptible-infected-recovered) epidemiological model. We show that disorder
expressed in the host morphology and anisotropy reduces the probability of
epidemic outbreak and thus makes the system more resistant to epidemic
outbreaks. We obtain general analytical estimates for minimally safe bounds for
an invasion threshold and then illustrate their validity by considering an
example of host data for branching hosts (salamander retinal ganglion cells).
Several spatial arrangements of hosts with different degrees of heterogeneity
have been considered in order to analyse separately the role of shape
complexity and anisotropy in the host population. The estimates for invasion
threshold are linked to morphological characteristics of the hosts that can be
used for determining the threshold for invasion in practical applications.

time-latitude patterns are strikingly similar over all the cycle. This
comparison shows that densities at 6 solar radii can be used to infer the solar
wind type close to its source, with high (resp. low) densities tracing the slow
(resp. fast) solar wind, simply because the density reflects at which altitude
occurs the acceleration. The comparison between the two minima suggests that
the fast polar wind acceleration occurs at larger distance during the current
minimum compared to the previous one. This difference, potentially linked to
the magnetic field decrease or(and) the coronal temperature decrease should be
reproduced by solar wind expansion models.

the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope, revealing a bright afterglow and a decay
slope suggestive of a reverse shock origin. Subsequent optical-IR observations
followed the light curve for 6.5 days. The temporal and spectral behavior at
optical-infrared frequencies is consistent with synchrotron fireball model
predictions; the cooling break lies between optical and XRT frequencies ~ 1.9
days after the burst. The inferred electron energy index is $p = 1.8 \pm 0.2$,

the LAT temporal index is marginally consistent with the predicted temporal
decay in the radiative regime of the forward shock model. Absence of a jet

small, although current analytic and semi-analytic approaches overestimate this
SZ power. We find the power at high 2000-10000 multipoles which ACT and SPT

frequency of extreme events, in our case the cell or smoothing volume with the
highest count of cluster-mass dark matter haloes, is well described by a Gumbel

finding even more extreme events, which would otherwise require a much larger
ensemble of simulations to quantify. We use our technique to assess the chance
of finding concentrations of massive clusters or super- clusters, like the two
found in the two-degree field galaxy redshift survey (2dFGRS), using a
counts-in-cells analysis. The Gumbel distribution gives an excellent descrip-
tion of the distribution of extreme cell counts across two large ensembles of
simulations covering different cosmologies, and also when measuring the

previously detected as unresolved point-sources by the SMA in its compact

far-infrared in the submillimetre directly. The visibility functions of both
targets show significant evidence for structure on 0.5-1 arcsec scales, which
at z=1.5 translates into a physical scale of 5-8 kpc. Our results are
consistent with the angular and physical scales of two comparably luminous
objects with high-resolution SMA followup, as well as radio continuum and CO
sizes. These relatively compact sizes (<5-10 kpc) argue strongly for
merger-driven starbursts, rather than extended gas-rich disks, as the preferred
channel for forming SMGs. For the most luminous objects, the derived sizes may
also have important physical consequences; under a series of simplifying

ratios between m_{3/2} and the Hubble scale of inflation. This is possible
because the expectation value of the superpotential <W> relaxes from large to
small values during the course of inflation. However, our toy models do not
provide a reasonable fit to cosmological data if one sets the SUSY-breaking
scale to m_{3/2} < TeV. Our work is a small step towards relieving the apparent
tension between high-scale inflation and low-scale supersymmetry breaking in
string compactifications.

the two main search channels, the gluon-gluon fusion mechanism $gg \to H$ and
the Higgs-strahlung processes $q \bar q \to VH$ with $V=W/Z$, including all
relevant higher order QCD and electroweak corrections in perturbation theory.
We then estimate the various uncertainties affecting these predictions: the
scale uncertainties which are viewed as a measure of the unknown higher order
effects, the uncertainties from the parton distribution functions and the
related errors on the strong coupling constant, as well as the uncertainties
due to the use of an effective theory approach in the determination of the
radiative corrections in the $gg \to H$ process at next-to-next-to-leading
order. We find that while the cross sections are well under control in the
Higgs--strahlung processes, the theoretical uncertainties are rather large in
the case of the gluon-gluon fusion channel, possibly shifting the central
values of the next-to-next-to-leading order cross sections by more than
$\approx 40%$. These uncertainties are thus significantly larger than the
$\approx 10%$ error assumed by the CDF and D0 experiments in their recent
analysis that has excluded the Higgs mass range $M_H=$162-166 GeV at the 95%
confidence level. These exclusion limits should be, therefore, reconsidered in

and so it is sensitive to the extra dimensions of brane worlds. Now, in flat
spacetimes of arbitrary dimension the two standard approaches to the Casimir
force, Green's function and zeta function, yield the same result, but for brane
world models this was only assumed. In this work we show both approaches yield
the same Casimir force in the case of Universal Extra Dimensions and
Randall-Sundrum scenarios with one and two branes added by p compact
dimensions. Essentially, the details of the mode eigenfunctions that enter the
Casimir force in the Green's function approach get removed due to their
orthogonality relations with a measure involving the right hyper-volume of the
plates and this leaves just the contribution coming from the Zeta function
approach. The present analysis corrects previous results showing a difference
between the two approaches for the single brane Randall-Sundrum; this was due
to an erroneous hyper-volume of the plates introduced by the authors when using
the Green's function. For all the models we discuss here, the resulting Casimir
force can be neatly expressed in terms of two four dimensional Casimir force
contributions: one for the massless mode and the other for a tower of massive
modes associated with the extra dimensions.

segmentation algorithm for separating the worms from the background using
brightfield images. We also show that by combining the output of this
segmentation algorithm with an algorithm to detect the fluorescent dye, Nile

down the jet along different trajectories with Lorentz factors $\Gamma>$10. The
disturbances show a clear connection with millimeter-wave outbursts, in 2005
May/June, 2007 July, and 2007 December. High-amplitude optical events in the
$R$-band light curve precede peaks of the millimeter-wave outbursts by 15-50
days. Each optical outburst is accompanied by an increase in X-ray activity. We
associate the optical outbursts with propagation of the superluminal knots and
derive the location of sites of energy dissipation in the form of radiation.
The most prominent and long-lasting of these, in 2005 May, occurred closer to
the black hole, while the outbursts with a shorter duration in 2005 Autumn and
in 2007 might be connected with the passage of a disturbance through the
millimeter-wave core of the jet. The optical outbursts, which coincide with the
passage of superluminal radio knots through the core, are accompanied by
systematic rotation of the position angle of optical linear polarization. Such
rotation appears to be a common feature during the early stages of flares in
blazars. We find correlations between optical variations and those at X-ray and
$\gamma$-ray energies. We conclude that the emergence of a superluminal knot
from the core yields a series of optical and high-energy outbursts, and that
the mm-wave core lies at the end of the jet's acceleration and collimation
zone.

reach their best accuracy for the bulk of the faint galaxy population when

effective number density of galaxies then used for WL is ~45gal/arcmin2, at

deficiency which make their use in some applications prohibitive. The power
loss is due to the inherent energy dissipation when SCC operate between or
outside their output target voltages. This drawback was alleviated in this work
by developing two new classes of SCC providing binary and arbitrary resolution
of closely spaced target voltages. Special attention is paid to SCC topologies
of binary resolution. Namely, SCC systems that can be configured to have a
no-load output to input voltage ratio that is equal to any binary fraction for
a given number of bits. To this end, we define a new number system and develop
rules to translate these numbers into SCC hardware that follows the algebraic
behavior. According to this approach, the flying capacitors are automatically
kept charged to binary weighted voltages and consequently the resolution of the
target voltages follows a binary number representation and can be made higher
by increasing the number of capacitors (bits). The ability to increase the
number of target voltages reduces the spacing between them and, consequently,
increases the efficiency when the input varies over a large voltage range. The
thesis presents the underlining theory of the binary SCC and its extension to
the general radix case. Although the major application is in step-down SCC, a
simple method to utilize these SCC for step-up conversion is also described, as
well as a method to reduce the output voltage ripple. In addition, the generic
and unified model is strictly applied to derive the SCC equivalent resistor,
which is a measure of the power loss. The theoretical predictions are verified
by simulation and experimental results.

$O(\log L \cdot \log |E|)$, where $L$ is the largest path length in the
players' strategy sets and $E$ is the set of edges in the graph. By adjusting

is carried out in the mean field framework (Hartree- Fock- Bogoliubov

The main ingredients entering the octupole collective Hamiltonian are evaluated
and the lowest lying octupole eigenstates are obtained. In this way we restore,
in an approximate way, the parity symmetry spontaneously broken by the mean
field and also incorporate octupole fluctuations around the ground state
solution. For each isotope the energy of the lowest lying $1^{-}$state and the

both the experimental data and the results obtained in the same framework with
the Gogny D1S interaction, which are used here as a well established benchmark.
Finally, the octupolarity of the configurations involved in the way down to
fission of $^{240}$Pu, which is strongly connected to the asymmetric fragment

Spectroscopic observations at high signal-to-noise ratio have been obtained for
all DA and DB stars in the Kiso Schmidt ultraviolet excess survey (KUV stars).
These observations led to the reclassification of several KUV objects,
including the discovery of three unresolved DA+DB double degenerate binaries.
The atmospheric parameters (Teff and log g) are obtained from detailed model
atmosphere fits to optical spectroscopic data. The mass distribution of our
sample is characterized by a mean value of 0.606 Msun and a dispersion of 0.135
Msun for DA stars, and 0.758 Msun and a dispersion of 0.192 Msun for DB stars.
Absolute visual magnitudes obtained from our spectroscopic fits allow us to
derive an improved luminosity function for the DA and DB stars identified in
the Kiso survey. Our luminosity function is found to be significantly different
from earlier estimates based on empirical photometric calibrations of Mv for
the same sample. The results for the DA stars now appear entirely consistent
with those obtained for the PG survey using the same spectroscopic approach.
The space density for DA stars with Mv<12.75 is 2.80X10^-4 pc^-3 in the Kiso

optimization problems. To design a memetic algorithm one needs to make a host
of decisions; selecting a population size is one of the most important among
them. Most algorithms in the literature fix the population size to a certain
constant value. This reduces the algorithm's quality since the optimal
population size varies for different instances, local search procedures and
running times. In this paper we propose an adjustable population size. It is
calculated as a function of the running time of the whole algorithm and the
average running time of the local search for the given instance. Note that in
many applications the running time of a heuristic should be limited and
therefore we use this limit as a parameter of the algorithm. The average
running time of the local search procedure is obtained during the algorithm's
run. Some coefficients which are independent with respect to the instance or
the local search are to be tuned before the algorithm run; we provide a
procedure to find these coefficients. The proposed approach was used to develop
a memetic algorithm for the Multidimensional Assignment Problem (MAP or s-AP in
the case of s dimensions) which is an extension of the well-known assignment
problem. MAP is NP-hard and has a host of applications. We show that using
adjustable population size makes the algorithm flexible to perform well for
instances of very different sizes and types and for different running times and
local searches. This allows us to select the most efficient local search for
every instance type. The results of computational experiments for several
instance families and sizes prove that the proposed algorithm performs
efficiently for a wide range of the running times and clearly outperforms the
state-of-the art 3-AP memetic algorithm being given the same time.

present a mechanism for the formation of such planets via disk fragmentation in
the embedded phase of star formation. In this phase, the forming disk
intensively accretes matter from the natal cloud core and undergoes several
fragmentation episodes. However, most fragments are either destroyed or driven
into the innermost regions (and probably onto the star) due to angular momentum
exchange with spiral arms, leading to multiple FU-Ori-like bursts and disk
expansion. Fragments that are sufficiently massive and form in the late
embedded phase (when the disk conditions are less extreme) may open a gap and
evolve into giant planets on typical orbits of several tens to several hundreds
of AU. For this mechanism to work, the natal cloud core must have sufficient
mass and angular momentum to trigger the burst mode and also form extended
disks of the order of several hundreds of AU. When mass loading from the natal
cloud core diminishes and the main fragmentation phase ends, such extended
disks undergo a transient episode of contraction and density increase, during
which they may give birth to a last and survivable set of giant planets on wide
and relatively stable orbits.

of 1.3mm and 2.8mm. The angular resolution of the maps is as high as
0.15arcsec, or 20AU at the distance of the Taurus cloud, which is a factor of 2
higher than has been achieved to date at these wavelengths. The unprecedented
detail of the resulting disk images enables us to address three important
questions related to the formation of planets. (1) What is the radial
distribution of the circumstellar dust? (2) Does the dust emission show any
indication of gaps that might signify the presence of (proto-)planets? (3) Do
the dust properties depend on the orbital radius? We find that modeling the
disk surface density in terms of either a classical power law or the similarity
solution for viscous disk evolution, reproduces the observations well. The
1.3mm image from RYTau shows two peaks separated by 0.2arcsec with a decline in
the dust emission toward the stellar position, which is significant at about
2-4sigma. For both RYTau and DGTau, the dust emission at radii larger than 15
AU displays no significant deviation from an unperturbed viscous disk model. In
particular, no radial gaps in the dust distribution are detected. Under
reasonable assumptions, we exclude the presence of planets more massive than 5
Jupiter masses orbiting either star at distances between about 10 and 60 AU.
The radial variation of the dust opacity slope, beta, was investigated by
comparing the 1.3mm and 2.8mm observations. We find mean values of beta of 0.5
and 0.7 for DGTau and RYTau respectively. Variations in beta are smaller than
0.7 between 20 and 70 AU. These results confirm that the circumstellar dust
throughout these disks differs significantly from dust in the interstellar
medium.

electron spin coherence, and extract the information about the bath structures?
Here we show that, among hundreds of C-13 bath spins, there exist strong

electron spin coherence. By analyzing these oscillation features, the key
properties of the coherent nuclear spin clusters, such as positions,
orientations, and coupling strengths, could be uniquely identified. This
addressability of the few-nuclear-spin cluster extends the feasibility of using
the nuclear spins in diamond as qubits in quantum computing. Furthermore, it

transmitter is non-causally provided with the message of the other transmitter.
This channel model has been extensively studied in the past years and capacity
results for certain classes of channels have been proved. In this paper we
present new inner and outer bounds for the capacity region of the cognitive
interference channel as well as new capacity results. Previously proposed outer
bounds are expressed in terms of auxiliary random variables for which no
cardinality constraint is known. Consequently it is not possible to evaluate
such outer bounds explicitly for a given channel model. The outer bound we
derive is based on an idea originally devised by Sato for the broadcast channel
and does not contain auxiliary random variables, allowing it to be more easily
evaluated. The inner bound we derive is the largest known to date and is
explicitly shown to include all previously proposed achievable rate regions.
This comparison highlights which features of the transmission scheme - which
includes rate-splitting, superposition coding, a broadcast channel-like binning
scheme, and Gel'fand Pinsker coding - are most effective in approaching
capacity. We next present new capacity results for a class of discrete
memoryless channels that we term the ""better cognitive decoding regime"" which
includes all previously known regimes in which capacity results have been
derived as special cases. Finally, we determine the capacity region of the
semi-deterministic cognitive interference channel, in which the signal at the
cognitive receiver is a deterministic function of the channel inputs.

statistics are compared to direct numerical simulation and experimental data at

potential-field-source surface model (PFSS), we calculate the normal distance
from the solar wind ""foot point"" to the local helisopheric current sheet on
that surface. We find that the source region of the streamer stalk wind is
narrower compared to the previous minimum. The area outside the streamer stalk
is accordingly larger, but the magnetic field strength is observed to be lower,
with the result that the total amount of the magnetic open flux from the
outside of streamer stalk region is conserved in the two successive solar

delay in diffusively coupled phase oscillator populations. We find that
coupling delay induces chimera and globally clustered chimera (GCC) states in
delay coupled populations. We show the existence of multi-clustered states that
act as link between the chimera and the GCC states. A stable GCC state goes
through a variety of GCC states, namely periodic, aperiodic, long-- and
short--period breathers and becomes unstable GCC leading to global
synchronization in the system, on increasing time delay. We provide numerical
evidence and theoretical explanations for the above results and discuss

systems made up of different particles mass have different statistical and

small halos, and it implies a possible connection to the so called ""small scale

reductions of the intra and intersubband scattering rates due to the
suppression of the interface-like modes. For a quantum well (QW) with a finite

discrete energy spectrum above the well. The electron capture process under
these circumstances is defined as the electron transition from the first
electron subband above the well to all possible subbands inside the well by the
emission of hybrid phonons. Explicit calculations reveal that the capture rates
are characterized by sharp peaks, referred to as electron resonances which
arise when a new electron state is generated on increasing the quantum well

is well known for its erratic behaviour in X-rays as well as in the radio,
occasionally producing major radio flares associated with relativistic
ejections. However, even after many years of observations in various wavelength
bands Cyg X-3 still eludes clear physical understanding. Studying different
emission bands simultaneously in microquasars has proved to be a fruitful
approach towards understanding these systems, especially by shedding light on
the accretion disc/jet connection. We continue this legacy by constructing a
hardness-intensity diagram (HID) from archival Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer data
and linking simultaneous radio observations to it. We find that surprisingly
Cyg X-3 sketches a similar shape in the HID to that seen in other transient
black hole X-ray binaries during outburst but with distinct differences.
Together with the results of this analysis and previous studies of Cyg X-3 we
conclude that the X-ray states can be assigned to six distinct states. This
categorization relies heavily on the simultaneous radio observations and we
identify one new X-ray state, the hypersoft state, similar to the ultrasoft
state, which is associated to the quenched radio state during which there is no
or very faint radio emission. Recent observations of GeV flux observed from Cyg
X-3 (Tavani et al. 2009; Fermi LAT Collaboration et al. 2009) during a soft
X-ray and/or radio quenched state at the onset of a major radio flare hint that
a very energetic process is at work during this time, which is also when the
hypersoft X-ray state is observed. In addition, Cyg X-3 shows flaring with a
wide range of hardness.

noncommutativity, which corresponds to a length scale $\lesssim 10^{-43}$ m.
This bound comes from a different model of spacetime deformation more adapted

traditional methods. This work was motivated by the belief that some ideas from
software engineering should be applied to graph algorithms. Re-usability of
software is an important and difficult problem in general, and this is
particularly true for graph algorithms. The scientific literature demonstrates
plenty of applications of graph algorithms as subroutines for other algorithms.
Moreover, many practical problems from various domains may be modeled as graph
problems and hence solved by means of graph algorithms. Chapter 2 introduces
some data structures that will be used in 5 basic graph algorithms in chapter
3. Chapter 4 discusses an implementation of a maximum cardinality matching
algorithm for general graphs. Chapter 5 explains some techniques in C++, which
are useful to implement the data structures and algorithms in an efficient way.
Finally chapter 6 contains some concluding remarks.

rotational velocity is estimated by fitting synthetic profiles to isolated
lines in the observed spectrum. A maximum likelihood estimation is used to
determine the parameters of the observed p modes. We perform a global fit, in
which modes are fitted simultaneously over nine radial orders, with degrees
ranging from l=0 to l=3 (36 individual modes). Precise estimates of the
atmospheric parameters (Teff, [M/H], log g) and of the vsini of HD 49385 are
obtained. The seismic analysis of the star leads to a clear identification of
the modes for degrees l=0,1,2. Around the maximum of the signal (nu=1013
microHz), some peaks are found significant and compatible with the expected
characteristics of l=3 modes. Our fit yields robust estimates of the
frequencies, linewidths and amplitudes of the modes. We find amplitudes of
about 5.6 +/- 0.8 ppm for radial modes at the maximum of the signal. The
lifetimes of the modes range from one day (at high frequency) to a bit more
than two days (at low frequency). Significant peaks are found outside the
identified ridges and are fitted. They are attributed to mixed modes.

perfect accretion models. We also find that for the realistic accretion model,
the spin angular velocity is about 30% smaller than that for the perfect
accretion model that is as large as the critical spin angular velocity for
rotational instability. The spin angular velocity and obliquity obey Gaussian
and isotropic distributions, respectively, independently of the accretion
condition.

Ia supernova remnants (SNRs) expanding into a uniform interstellar medium

dissipation are adopted. Phenomenological models for thermal leakage injection
are considered as well. We find that the preshock gas temperature is the
primary parameter that governs the cosmic ray (CR) acceleration efficiency and
energy spectrum, while the CR injection rate is a secondary parameter. For SNRs
in the warm ISM, if the injection fraction is larger than 10^{-4}, the DSA is
efficient enough to convert more than 20 % of the SN explosion energy into CRs
and the accelerated CR spectrum exhibits a concave curvature flattening to
E^{-1.6}. Such a flat source spectrum near the knee energy, however, may not be
reconciled with the CR spectrum observed at Earth. On the other hand, SNRs in
the hot ISM, with an injection fraction smaller than 10^{-4}, are inefficient
accelerators with less than 10 % of the explosion energy getting converted to
CRs. Also the shock structure is almost test-particle like and the ensuing CR
spectrum can be steeper than E^{-2}. With amplified magnetic field strength of
order of 30 microG, Alfven waves generated by the streaming instability may
drift upstream fast enough to make the modified test-particle power-law as
steep as E^{-2.3}, which is more consistent with the observed CR spectrum.

of Algol-type binary stars. In wider Algols the accretion is through a disc so
that the accreted material can transfer enough angular momentum to the gainer
that material at its equator should be spinning at break-up. We demonstrate
that even a small amount of mass transfer, much less than required to produce
today's mass ratios, transfers enough angular momentum to spin the gainer up to
this critical rotation velocity. However the accretors in these systems have
spins typically between 10 and $40\,$per cent of the critical rate. So some
mechanism for angular momentum loss from the gainers is required. We consider
generation of magnetic fields in the radiative atmospheres in a differentially
rotating star and the possibility of angular momentum loss driven by strong
stellar winds in the intermediate mass stars, such as the primaries of the
Algols. Differential rotation, induced by the accretion itself, may produce
such winds which carry away enough angular momentum to reduce their rotational
velocities to the today's observed values. We apply this model to two systems
with initial periods of 5\,d, one with initial masses 5 and $3\,\rm{M}_{\odot}$
and the other with 3.2 and $2\,\rm{M}_{\odot}$. Our calculations show that, if
the mass outflow rate in the stellar wind is about $10\,$per cent of the
accretion rate and the dipole magnetic field is stronger than about $1\,$kG,
the spin rate of the gainer is reduced to below break-up velocity even in the
fast phase of mass transfer. Larger mass loss is needed for smaller magnetic
fields. The slow rotation of the gainers in the classical Algol systems is
explained by a balance between the spin-up by mass accretion and spin-down by a
stellar wind linked to a magnetic field.

theory of meaning in terms of vector space models, and a compositional theory
for grammatical types, for which we rely on the algebra of Pregroups,
introduced by Lambek. This mathematical framework enables us to compute the
meaning of a well-typed sentence from the meanings of its constituents.
Concretely, the type reductions of Pregroups are `lifted' to morphisms in a
category, a procedure that transforms meanings of constituents into a meaning
of the (well-typed) whole. Importantly, meanings of whole sentences live in a
single space, independent of the grammatical structure of the sentence. Hence
the inner-product can be used to compare meanings of arbitrary sentences, as it
is for comparing the meanings of words in the distributional model. The
mathematical structure we employ admits a purely diagrammatic calculus which
exposes how the information flows between the words in a sentence in order to
make up the meaning of the whole sentence. A variation of our `categorical
model' which involves constraining the scalars of the vector spaces to the
semiring of Booleans results in a Montague-style Boolean-valued semantics.

angular diameter, using various types of input data. Each diameter estimate,
obtained for the test-case calibrator star lambda Gru, is compared with the
value 2.71 mas found in the Bord\'e calibrator catalogue published in 2002.
Methods. Angular size estimations from spectral type, spectral index, in-band
magnitude, broadband photometry, and spectrophotometry give close estimates of
the angular diameter, with slightly variable uncertainties. Fits on photometry
and spectrophotometry need physical atmosphere models with ""plausible"" stellar
parameters. Angular diameter uncertainties were estimated by means of residual
bootstrapping confidence intervals. All numerical results and graphical outputs
presented in this paper were obtained using the routines developed under
PV-WAVE, which compose the modular software suite SPIDAST, created to calibrate

those obtained with VLTI-AMBER. Results. The final angular diameter estimate

time-scales into a stochastic stationary Markovian process affects its
conditional probability. To this end, we consider two Gaussian processes: (i) a
short-range correlated process with an infinite set of time-scales bounded from
below, and (ii) a power-law correlated process with an infinite and unbounded
set of time-scales. For these processes we investigate the equal position
conditional probability P(x,t|x,0) and the mean First Passage Time T(L). The
function P(x,t|x,0) can be considered as a proxy of the persistence, i.e. the
fact that when a process reaches a position x then it spends some time around
that position value. The mean First Passage Time can be considered as a proxy
of how fast is the process in reaching a position at distance L starting from
position x. In the first investigation we show that the more time-scales the
process includes, the larger the persistence. Specifically, we show that the
power-law correlated process shows a slow power-law decay of P(x,t|x,0) to the
stationary pdf. By contrast, the short range correlated process shows a decay
dominated by an exponential cut-off. Moreover, we also show that the existence
of an infinite and unbouded set of time-scales is a necessary and not
sufficient condition for observing a slow power-law decay of P(x,t|x,0). In the
second investigation, we show that for large values of L the more time-scales
the process includes, the larger the mean First Passage Time, i.e. the slowest
the process. On the other hand, for small values of L, the more time-scales the
process includes, the smaller the mean First Passage Time, i.e. when a process
statistically spends more time in a given position the likelihood that it
reached nearby positions by chance is also enhanced.

loop in N=4 SYM is characterised by the remainder function. Because of the
perturbative origins of the BDS expression, the remainder function is more
natural at weak than at strong coupling. We advocate instead a more direct
approach, based on considering ratios of Wilson loops. This allows us to define
a manifestly finite, regularisation independent, conformally invariant
quantity. It does not make a direct reference to the BDS expression and the
definition is regularisation independent. It is a natural object at weak and at
strong coupling, and in the latter case is directly related to the free energy
of an auxiliary integrable system. We then compute these ratios for continuous
families of regular polygons for 6,8 and 10 points at one and two-loops. These
results are compared to expressions derived recently at strong coupling.

never vanishes for all positive integers $m$, where $\tau (m)$ is the $m$-th
Fourier coefficient of the cusp form $\Delta_{24}$ of weight 12. The theory of
spherical $t$-design is closely related to Lehmer's conjecture because it is
shown, by Venkov, de la Harpe, and Pache, that $\tau (m)=0$ is equivalent to
the fact that the shell of norm $2m$ of the $E_{8}$-lattice is a spherical
8-design. So, Lehmer's conjecture is reformulated in terms of spherical
$t$-design.
  Lehmer's conjecture is difficult to prove, and still remains open. However,
Bannai-Miezaki showed that none of the nonempty shells of the integer lattice
$\ZZ^2$ in $\RR^2$ is a spherical 4-design, and that none of the nonempty
shells of the hexagonal lattice $A_2$ is a spherical 6-design. Moreover, none
of the nonempty shells of the integer lattices associated to the algebraic
integers of imaginary quadratic fields whose class number is either 1 or 2,
except for $\QQ(\sqrt{-1})$ and $\QQ(\sqrt{-3})$ is a spherical 2-design. In
the proof, the theory of modular forms played an important role.
  Recently, Yudin found an elementary proof for the case of $\ZZ^{2}$-lattice
which does not use the theory of modular forms but uses the recent results of
Calcut. In this paper, we give the elementary (i.e., modular form free) proof
and discuss the relation between Calcut's results and the theory of imaginary

for three HII regions, along with the kinematic distance for others, suggests
that all of them belong to the same molecular cloud complex. Using NIR
photometry, we identified the most probable ionizing sources of six HII
regions. Their approximate photometric spectral type estimates suggest that
they are massive early-B to mid-O ZAMS stars and agree well with radio
continuum observations at 1280 MHz. The morphology of the complex shows a
non-uniform distribution of warm and hot dust, well mixed with the ionized gas,
which correlates well with the variation of average visual extinction (~ 4.2 -
97 mag) across the region. We estimated the physical parameters of ionized gas
with the help of radio continuum observations. We detected an optically visible
compact nebula located to the south of the 850 micron emission associated with
one of the HII regions and the diagnostic of the optical emission line ratios
gives electron density and electron temperature of ~ 0.67 x 10^3 cm^-3 and ~

are in different stages of evolution, which correlate well with the probable
ages in the range ~ 0.01 - 2 Myr of the ionizing sources. The positions of IR

stochastically excited? By employing a statistical method which searches for
the signature of stochastic excitation in stellar pulsations, we investigate

general family of probability measures that are not dominated by a single

probabilistic representations of fully nonlinear partial differential equations
and applications to mathematical finance. The existing literature relies either
on the capacity theory (by Denis and Martini), or on the underlying nonlinear
partial differential equation (by Peng). In both approaches, the resulting
theory requires the smoothness of the corresponding processes and random
variables in terms of the underlying canonical process. In this paper, we
investigate this question for a larger class of ""non-smooth"" processes, but
with a restricted family of non-dominated probability measures. For smooth
processes, our approach leads to similar results as in previous literature,
provided the restricted family satisfies an additional density property.

The latter arise in the five-flavour scheme. Predictions for the Tevatron and

fish-like bodies are investigated using high-fidelity numerical simulation. The
solution of the Navier--Stokes equations is carried out with a viscous vortex
particle method. Configurations of tethered pairs of fish arranged side by side
are studied by varying the lateral separation distance and relative phase
difference. It is shown that, in mirroring symmetry, the fish in the pair
augment each other's thrust even at relatively large separations (up to ten
body lengths). At small distances, this augmentation is primarily brought about
by a peristaltic pumping in the gap between the fish, whereas at larger
distances, the thrust is affected by subtle changes in the vortex shedding at
the tail due to interactions with the other fish. In cases without symmetric
undulation, one fish always draws more benefit from the interaction than the
other. Finally, lateral configurations with three fish are studied with
mirroring symmetry between neighboring fish. Whereas the center fish draws a
net thrust benefit, this comes at the expense of a net drag on the outer two
fish. Each adjacent pair in this arrangement is slightly affected by the
presence of the third fish.

gravitational force between two particles with relativistic velocities
increases significantly with velocity and in fact becomes unbound as the latter
approaches c. One may thus construct a deterministic model of three fast
rotating light particles which uses gravitation as the attractive force,
special relativity, the weak equivalence principle and introduces angular
momentum quantization as in the Bohr model of the H atom. The model shows the
existence of stable rotational states corresponding to highly relativistic
particle velocities with radii in the fm range. When the rest masses of the
three light particles is in the mass range of neutrinos (~0.1 eV/c^2), then
surprisingly the rest masses and Compton wavelengths of these rotational states
are found to correspond to those of baryons and in fact the masses (~1 GeV/c^2)
reproduce quite well the light baryon mass spectrum. Interestingly the model
also predicts a lower limit for the lifetime of the baryons which is consistent
with their measured lifetimes and yields a good approximation for their
magnetic moments. It thus appears that this deterministic Bohr-type approach to
subatomic phenomena, i.e. a classical special relativistic treatment coupled
with the de Broglie wavelength expression to seek conformity with quantum
mechanics, may be a useful zeroth-order model to explore some quantum gravity
problems.

energy-per-particle. Below the threshold, the dynamics are regular, while far
above the threshold, complete thermalization is observed, as measured by the
normalized spectral entropy. We study individual resonances in the Bose-Hubbard
model to determine the criterion for chaos. The criterion based on Chirikov's
method of overlapping resonances diverges in the thermodynamic limit, in
contrast to the criterion parameters inferred from numerical calculations,
signifying the failure of the standard Chirikov's approach. The Ablowitz-Ladik
lattice is one of several integrable models that are close to the BHM. We
outline the method of Inverse Scattering Transform and generate the integrals
of motion of the Ablowitz-Ladik lattice. Furthermore, we discuss the possible
role of these quantities in the relaxation dynamics of the BHM.

  Emphasis on India",,,,,"physics.gen-ph physics.geo-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Two discoveries have greatly impacted understanding relevant to the
origination and emplacement of petroleum and natural gas deposits. One
discovery, pertaining to hydrocarbon formation from methane broadens
significantly potential regions where abiotic petroleum and natural gas
deposits might be found. The other, discovery of the physical impossibility of
Earth-mantle convection, restricts the range and domain of geodynamic behavior,
and leads to new insights on the formation of petroleum and natural gas
deposits. This article highlights the impact and implications of those
discoveries, especially as they relate to petroleum and natural gas exploration
in India and throughout the world. From the reasoning developed here, the
generality of the considerations involved, the understanding developed with
respect to the East African Rift System, and the experience garnered from the
larger and older Siberian Traps, the prognosis and potential for the region
beneath the Deccan Traps of India to eventually become a major source of
petroleum and natural gas seems quite favorable.

and tidally enhanced collapsars. We make use of BINPOP and BINKIN, two
components of a recently developed population synthesis package. Results focus
on correlations of both binary and spatial evolutionary population
characteristics. Pulsar and long duration gamma-ray burst observations are used
in concert with our models to draw the conclusions that: double neutron star
binaries can merge rapidly on timescales of a few million years (much less than
that found for the observed double neutron star population), common envelope
evolution within these models is a very important phase in double neutron star
formation, and observations of long gamma-ray burst projected distances are
more centrally concentrated than our simulated coalescing double neutron star
and collapsar Galactic populations. Better agreement is found with dwarf galaxy
models although the outcome is strongly linked to the assumed birth radial
distribution. The birth rate of the double neutron star population in our
models range from 4-160 Myr^-1 and the merger rate ranges from 3-150 Myr^-1.
The upper and lower limits of the rates results from including electron capture
supernova kicks to neutron stars and decreasing the common envelope efficiency
respectively. Our double black hole merger rates suggest that black holes
should receive an asymmetric kick at birth.
