present Very Large Array images at 74 MHz and 327 MHz of two giant radio

the source. The radio spectrum follows a power-law in the hot-spots, while in
the inner region of the lobe the shape of the spectrum shows a curvature at
high frequencies. This steepening is in agreement with synchrotron aging of the
emitting relativistic electrons. In order to estimate the synchrotron age of
the sources, the spectra have been fitted with a synchrotron model of emission.

Venus in comparison with our planet. In a second part we have computed
precisely the Oppolzer terms which allow to represent the motion in space of
the third Venus figure axis with respect to Venus angular momentum axis, under
the influence of the solar gravitational torque. We have determined the
corresponding tables of coefficients of nutation of the third figure axis both
in longitude and in obliquity due to the Sun, which are of the same order of
amplitude as for the Earth. We have shown that the coefficients of nutation for
the third figure axis are significantly different from those of the angular

negative specific heat can be found in isolated systems, which are studied in

translates into safety in real-life applications. A central tool in systems
theory for synthesizing control laws that achieve stability are control
Lyapunov functions (CLFs). Classically, a CLF enforces that the resulting
closed-loop state trajectory is contained within a cone with a fixed,
predefined shape, and which is centered at and converges to a desired
converging point. However, such a requirement often proves to be
overconservative, which is why most of the real-time controllers do not have a
stability guarantee. Recently, a novel idea that improves the design of CLFs in
terms of flexibility was proposed. The focus of this new approach is on the
design of optimization problems that allow certain parameters that define a
cone associated with a standard CLF to be decision variables. In this way
non-monotonicity of the CLF is explicitly linked with a decision variable that
can be optimized on-line. Conservativeness is significantly reduced compared to
classical CLFs, which makes \emph{flexible CLFs} more suitable for
stabilization of constrained discrete-time nonlinear systems and real-time
control. The purpose of this overview is to highlight the potential of flexible
CLFs for real-time control of fast mechatronic systems, with sampling periods
below one millisecond, which are widely employed in aerospace and automotive

Bell tests are subject to the detection loophole, making the protocol

fundamental limitation for DIQKD. Here, we introduce a heralded qubit amplifier

hosted by the planetary nebula PN G135.9+55.9 (TS01, Stasinska et al, 2009).
The nebula, located in the Galactic halo, is the most oxygen-poor one known to
date and is the only one known to harbor a double degenerate core. We present
XMM-Newton observations of this object, which allowed the detection of the
previously invisible component of the binary core, whose existence was inferred
so far only from radial velocity and photometric variations. The parameters of
the binary system were deduced from a wealth of information via three
independent routes using the spectral energy distribution (from the infrared to
X-rays), the light and radial velocity curves, and a detailed model atmosphere
fitting of the stellar absorption features of the optical/UV component. We find
that the cool component must have a mass of 0.54+/-0.2 Msun, an average
effective temperature, Teff, of 58000+/-3000 K, a mean radius of 0.43+/-0.3
Rsun, a gravity log g=5.0+/-0.3, and that it nearly fills its Roche lobe. Its
surface elemental abundances are found to be: 12 + log He/H = 10.95+/-0.04 dex,
12 + log C/H = 7.20+/-0.3 dex, 12 + log N/H < 6.92 and 12 + log O/H < 6.80, in
overall agreement with the chemical composition of the planetary nebula. The
hot component has Teff = 160-180 kK, a luminosity of about ~10e4 Lsun and a
radius slightly larger than that of a white dwarf. It is probably bloated and
heated as a result of intense accretion and nuclear burning on its surface in
the past. The total mass of the binary system is very close to Chandrasekhar
limit. This makes TS01 one of the best type Ia supernova progenitor candidates.
We propose two possible scenarios for the evolution of the system up to its
present stage.

Cost Function is composed of two parts: a simple harmonic approximation for the
energy-related terms and a cost that penalizes configurations that do not have
atoms in the desired coordinations. Using this approach, we generated a set of
amorphous carbon structures spawning nearly all the possible combinations of
$sp$, $sp^2$ and $sp^3$ hybridizations. The bulk moduli of this set of
amorphous carbons structures was calculated using Brenner's potential. The bulk
modulus strongly depends on the mean coordination, following a power law
behavior with an exponent $\nu=1.51 \pm 0.17$. A modified Cost Function that
segregates carbon with different hybridizations is also presented, and another
set of structures was generated. With this new set of amorphous materials, the
correlation between the bulk modulus and the mean coordination weakens. This
method proposed can be easily modified to explore the effects on physical
properties of the presence hydrogen, dangling bonds, and structural features
such as carbon rings.

create such an accelerator lattice one has to find magnetic and electrtic field

families of lattices with one invariant where bounded motion can be easily

when a collapsing Universe is reduced to a supermassive black hole of a small
size, a very strong field of the conjectured force may create
particle-antiparticle pairs from the surrounding vacuum. The amount of the
antimatter created from the physical vacuum is equal to the decrease of mass of

black hole is sufficiently small the creation of antimatter may become so huge
and fast, that matter of our Universe may disappear in a fraction of the Planck
time. So fast transformation of matter to antimatter may look like a Big Bang
with the initial size about 30 orders of magnitude greater than the Planck
length, questioning the need for inflation. In addition, a Big Crunch, of a
Universe dominated by matter, leads to a new Universe dominated by antimatter,
and vice versa; without need to invoke CP violation as explanation of

variability. In this Letter we present Keck-I spectroscopy which shows clear

their relative radial velocities, we measure a mass ratio q=0.50+/-0.13. We
conclude that the observed 5.4-minute period almost certainly represents the
orbital period of an interacting binary white dwarf. We thus confirm that HM
Cnc is the shortest-period binary star known: a unique test for stellar

In
the model, the lobes inflated by low-power jets are assumed to expand in near
pressure-balance against the external medium. Both cases of constant external
pressure and decreasing external pressure are considered. Evolution of an
individual source is described by the power-size track. The source appears as
its lobe is inflated and radio luminosity increases to above the detection
level; the source then moves along the track and eventually disappears as its
luminosity drops below the detection limit. The power-size tracks are
calculated including the combined energy losses due to synchrotron radiation,
adiabatic expansion, and inverse Compton scattering. It is shown that in
general, the constant-pressure model predicts an excess number of luminous,
small-size sources while underpredicting large-size sources in the power-size
diagram. The predicted spectra are steep for most sources, which is
inconsistent with observations. By comparison, the pressure-limiting model fits
observations better. In this model, low-luminosity sources undergo substantial
expansion losses in the initial phase and as a result, it predicts fewer
luminous, small-size sources. The resultant spectra are flat for most sources
except for the oldest ones, which seems consistent with observations. The
power-size tracks, in contrast to that of high-luminosity radio galaxies, are
characterized by a slow increase in luminosity for most of the source's life,
followed by a rapid decline when the synchrotron or inverse Compton scattering
losses set in.

Motivated by the fact that extra-dimensional models are non-renormalizable, we
truncate the Kaluza-Klein towers at a maximal extra-dimensional momentum. The
structure of the bulk Majorana mass term, motivated by the Sherk-Schwarz
mechanism, implies that the right-handed Kaluza-Klein neutrinos pair to form
Dirac neutrinos, except for a number of unpaired Majorana neutrinos at the top
of each tower. These heavy Majorana neutrinos are the only sources of lepton
number breaking in the model, and similarly to the type-I seesaw mechanism,
they naturally generate small masses for the left-handed neutrinos. The lower
Kaluza-Klein modes mix with the light neutrinos, and the mixing effects are not
suppressed with respect to the light-neutrino masses. Compared to conventional
fermionic seesaw models, such mixing can be more significant. We study the
signals of this model at the Large Hadron Collider, and find that the current
low-energy bounds on the non-unitarity of the leptonic mixing matrix are strong

galaxy group in the COSMOS field at a redshift of z=0.53 (hereafter CWAT-02).
We find that the host galaxy of CWAT-02 is the brightest galaxy in the group,
although it does not coincide with the center of mass of the system. Estimating
a) the velocity of CWAT-02, relative to the intra-cluster medium (ICM), and b)
the line-of-sight peculiar velocity of CWAT-02's host galaxy, relative to the
average velocity of the group, we find that both values are higher than those
expected for a dominant galaxy in a relaxed system. This suggests that
CWAT-02's host group is dynamically young and likely in the process of an
ongoing group merger. Our results are consistent with previous findings showing
that the presence of a wide-angle tail galaxy in a galaxy group or cluster can
be used as an indicator of dynamically young non-relaxed systems. Taking the
unrelaxed state of CWAT-02's host group into account, we discuss the impact of
radio-AGN heating from CWAT-02 onto its environment, in the context of the
missing baryon problem in galaxy groups. Our analysis strengthens recent
results suggesting that radio-AGN heating may be powerful enough to expel

Arrays (PTAs) is one of the goals of gravitational wave astronomy in the coming

expected to be individually resolved by up-coming PTAs, and our ability to use
them as astrophysical probes will depend on the accuracy with which their
parameters can be measured. In this paper we estimate the precision of such
measurements using the Fisher-information-matrix formalism. We restrict to
""monochromatic"" sources. In this approximation, the system is described by
seven parameters and we determine their expected statistical errors as a
function of the number of pulsars in the array, the array sky coverage, and the
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the signal. At fixed SNR, the gravitational wave
astronomy capability of a PTA is achieved with ~20 pulsars; adding more pulsars
(up to 1000) to the array reduces the source error-box in the sky \Delta\Omega
by a factor ~5 and has negligible consequences on the statistical errors on the
other parameters. \Delta\Omega improves as 1/SNR^2 and the other parameters as
1/SNR. For a fiducial PTA of 100 pulsars uniformly distributed in the sky and a
coherent SNR = 10, we find \Delta\Omega~40 deg^2, a fractional error on the
signal amplitude of ~30% (which constraints only very poorly the chirp mass -
luminosity distance combination M_c^{5/3}/D_L), and the source inclination and
polarization angles are recovered at the ~0.3 rad level. The ongoing Parkes PTA
is particularly sensitive to systems located in the southern hemisphere, where
at SNR = 10 the source position can be determined with \Delta\Omega ~10 deg^2,
but has poorer performance for sources in the northern hemisphere. (Abridged)

the presence of three components, a bulge, a nuclear star cluster, and a

counter-rotation seen in the central excess. Molecular hydrogen emission traces
a disk with rotation nearly orthogonal to that of the stars. The stellar
populations of the three components are also distinct, with half of the mass of

of the stellar kinematics gives a total nuclear star cluster mass of 1.1x10^7

hindered by uncertainties in the central stellar mass profile. Assuming a
constant mass-to-light ratio, the stellar dynamical modeling suggests a black

fit by a black hole with mass of 4.5x10^5 Msol. Unresolved and possibly

radiative cooling, star formation and feedback from SNII. The large-scale
morphology and kinematics are determined by the internal structure and the
orbit of the progenitor disks. The properties of the central region, in
particular the starburst in the overlap region, only match the observations for
a very short time interval of ~20 Myr after the second encounter. This
indicates that the Antennae galaxies are in a special phase only about 40 Myr
after the second encounter and 50 Myr before their final collision. This is the
only phase in the simulation when a gas-rich overlap region between the nuclei
is forming accompanied by enhanced star formation. The star formation rate as
well as the recent star formation history in the central region agree well with
observational estimates. For the first time this new model explains the
distributed extra-nuclear star formation in the Antennae galaxies as a
consequence of the recent second encounter. The proposed model predicts that
the Antennae are in a later merger stage than the Mice (NGC 4676) and would
therefore lose their first place in the classical Toomre sequence.

(mETGs) have finished their assembly at a quite late cosmic epoch (z~0.5),
conflicting directly with galaxy mass-downsizing. In Eliche-Moral et al.
(2010), we presented a semi-analytical model that predicts the increase by a
factor of ~2.5 observed in the number density of mETGs since z~1 to the
present, just accounting for the effects of the major mergers strictly-reported
by observations. Here, we describe the relative, coordinated role of wet,
mixed, and dry major mergers in driving this assembly. Accordingly to
observations, the model predicts that: 1) wet major mergers have controlled the
mETGs buildup since z~1, although dry and mixed mergers have also contributed
significantly to it; 2) the bulk of this assembly takes place during the ~1.4
Gyr time-period elapsed at 0.7<z<1, being nearly frozen at z<~0.7; 3) this
frostbite can be explained just accounting for the observational decrease of
the major merger fraction since z~0.7, implying that major mergers (and, in
particular, dry events) have contributed negligibly to the mETGs assembly
during the last ~6.3 Gyr; and 4) major mergers are responsible for doubling the
stellar mass at the massive-end of the red sequence since z~1. The most
striking model prediction is that at least ~87% of the mETGs existing at z~1
are not the passively-evolved, high-z counterparts of present-day mETGs, but
their gas-poor progenitors instead. This implies that <~5% of present-day mETGs
have been really in place since z~1. The model derives a redshift of final
assembly for present-day mETGs in agreement with hierarchical models (z~0.5),
reproducing at the same time the observed buildup of mETGs at z<~1.(Abridged)

experiments will require extremely well-characterized photometric redshift
measurements. Current estimates are that the true mean redshift of the objects
in each photo-z bin must be known to better than 0.002(1+z) if errors in
cosmological measurements are not to be degraded. A conventional approach is to
calibrate these photometric redshifts with large sets of spectroscopic
redshifts. However, at the depths probed by Stage III surveys (such as DES),
let alone Stage IV (LSST, JDEM, Euclid), existing large redshift samples have
all been highly (25-60%) incomplete. A powerful alternative approach is to
exploit the clustering of galaxies to perform photometric redshift
calibrations. Measuring the two-point angular cross-correlation between objects
in some photometric redshift bin and objects with known spectroscopic redshift
allows the true redshift distribution of a photometric sample to be
reconstructed in detail, even if it includes objects too faint for spectroscopy
or if spectroscopic samples are highly incomplete. We test this technique using
mock DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift survey light cones constructed from the Millennium
Simulation semi-analytic galaxy catalogs. From this realistic test, we find
that the true redshift distribution of a photometric sample can, in fact, be
determined accurately with cross-correlation techniques. We also compare the
empirical error in the reconstruction of redshift distributions to previous
analytic predictions, finding that additional components must be included in
error budgets to match the simulation results. We conclude by presenting a
step-by-step, optimized recipe for reconstructing redshift distributions using
standard correlation measurements.

theoretical treatments of galaxy evolution, despite the limited ability of
observations to trace them across cosmological timescales. If the strongest
MgII absorption-line systems detected in the spectra of background quasars
arise in such outflows, ""ultra-strong"" MgII (USMgII) absorbers would identify
significant numbers of galactic winds over a huge baseline in cosmic time, in a
manner independent of the luminous properties of the galaxy. To this end, we
present the first detailed imaging and spectroscopic study of the fields of two
USMgII absorber systems culled from a statistical absorber catalog, with the
goal of understanding the physical processes leading to the large velocity
spreads that define such systems. Each field contains two bright emission-line
galaxies at similar redshift (dv < 300 km/s) to that of the absorption.
Lower-limits on their instantaneous star formation rates (SFR) from the
observed OII and Hb line fluxes, and stellar masses from spectral template
fitting indicate specific SFRs among the highest for their masses at z~0.7.
Additionally, their 4000A break and Balmer absorption strengths imply they have
undergone recent (~0.01 - 1 Gyr) starbursts. The concomitant presence of two
rare phenomena - starbursts and USMgII absorbers - strongly implies a causal
connection. We consider these data and USMgII absorbers in general in the
context of various popular models, and conclude that galactic outflows are
generally necessary to account for the velocity extent of the absorption. We
favour starburst driven outflows over tidally-stripped gas from a major
interaction which triggered the starburst as the energy source for the majority
of systems. Finally, we discuss the implications of these results and speculate
on the overall contribution of such systems to the global SFR density at z~0.7.

In the course of photometric experiments for the purpose of recording the

with a two-dimensional phase-type diffraction grating, a significant deviation
from Lambert's law was detected when the diffuse photon gas was scattered by

protocols in the noisy-storage model, where the identity of the state
corresponds to a certain bit string, and the additional information is
typically a choice of encoding that is initially unknown to the cheating party.
We first provide simple optimality conditions for measurements for any such
problem, and show upper and lower bounds on the success probability. For a
certain class of problems, we furthermore provide tight bounds on how useful
post-measurement information can be. In particular, we show that for this class
finding the optimal measurement for the task of state discrimination with
post-measurement information does in fact reduce to solving a different problem
of state discrimination without such information. However, we show that for the
corresponding classical state discrimination problems with post-measurement
information such a reduction is impossible, by relating the success probability
to the violation of Bell inequalities. This suggests the usefulness of
post-measurement information as another feature that distinguishes the
classical from a quantum world.

voltage of the two capacitors and the current that flows on an inductor of the
Chua's circuit reveals various oscillation patterns as the conductance that is
connected between the two capacitors and directly connected to an inductor is
varied. At small conductance, the Lissajous graph of the voltage of the two
capacitors shows a spiral, while at high conductance a double scroll pattern
appears. The entropy of the current that flows on the inductor is alocal
minimum in the spiral state which is in the steady state, while it is maximum
in the stable double scroll state. The stable double scroll samples are
analyzed by using the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and the eigenvectors of the
transition matrix of long time series are found to be strictly positive but
those of unstable short time series have negative components. We thus confirm
maximum entropy production in the double scroll of the longest time series
around the right fixed point, while the local minimum entropy production occurs
in the spiral around the left fixed point.

the degraded Gaussian MIMO MAC is proven using Gaussian codebooks. For the
non-degraded Gaussian MIMO MAC, an algorithm inspired by interference alignment
technique is proposed to achieve the largest possible total
Secure-Degrees-of-Freedom (S-DoF). When all the terminals are equipped with a
single antenna, Gaussian codebooks have shown to be inefficient in providing a
positive S-DoF. Instead, a novel secure coding scheme is proposed to achieve a
positive S-DoF in the single antenna MAC. This scheme converts the
single-antenna system into a multiple-dimension system with fractional
dimensions. The achievability scheme is based on the alignment of signals into
a small sub-space at the eavesdropper, and the simultaneous separation of the
signals at the intended receiver. Tools from the field of Diophantine
Approximation in number theory are used to analyze the probability of error in
the coding scheme. It is proven that the total S-DoF of $\frac{K-1}{K}$ can be
achieved for almost all channel gains. For the other channel gains, a
multi-layer coding scheme is proposed to achieve a positive S-DoF. As a
function of channel gains, therefore, the achievable S-DoF is discontinued.

By construction, FDR control offers no guarantee in terms of power, or type II
error. A number of alternative procedures have been developed, including
plug-in procedures that aim at gaining power by incorporating an estimate of
the proportion of true null hypotheses. In this paper, we study the asymptotic

density of the $p$-values, as the number $m$ of tested hypotheses grows to
infinity. In a setting where the hypotheses tested are independent, we prove
that these procedures are asymptotically more powerful in two respects: (i) a
tighter asymptotic FDR control for any target FDR level and (ii) a broader
range of target levels yielding positive asymptotic power. We also show that
this increased asymptotic power comes at the price of slower, non-parametric
convergence rates for the FDP. These rates are of the form $m^{-k/(2k+1)}$,
where $k$ is determined by the regularity of the density of the $p$-value

results are applied to one- and two-sided tests statistics for Gaussian and

within an area of 1 h^{-1}_{72} Mpc radius (excluding the core). To investigate
the presence or not of a true enhancement of luminous X-ray AGN in the cluster
area, we also derived the corresponding optical galaxy overdensities, using a
suitable range of $r$-band magnitudes. We always find the latter to be
significantly higher (and only in two cases roughly equal) with respect to the
corresponding X-ray overdensities. Over the whole cluster sample, the mean
X-ray point-source overdensity is a factor of ~4 less than that corresponding
to bright optical galaxies, a difference which is significant at a >0.995
level, as indicated by an appropriate t-student test. We conclude that the
triggering of luminous X-ray AGN in rich clusters is strongly suppressed.
Furthermore, searching for optical SDSS counterparts of all the X-ray sources,
associated with our clusters, we found that about half appear to be background
QSOs, while others are background and foreground AGN or stars. The true
overdensity of X-ray point sources, associated to the clusters, is therefore

based on Spitzer MIPS observations of a sample of nine redshift-selected groups
from the XMM-IMACS (XI) project, at z=0.06. We find that on average the
star-forming (SF) galaxy fraction in the groups is about 30% lower than the
value in the field and 30% higher than in clusters. The SF fractions do not
show any systematic dependence on group velocity dispersion, total stellar
mass, or the presence of an X-ray emitting intragroup medium, but a weak
anti-correlation is seen between SF fraction and projected galaxy density.
However, even in the densest regions, the SF fraction in groups is still higher
than that in cluster outskirts, suggesting that preprocessing of galaxies in
group environments is not sufficient to explain the much lower SF fraction in
clusters. The typical specific star formation rates (SFR/M*) of SF galaxies in
groups are similar to those in the field across a wide range of stellar mass
(M*>10^9.6 msun), favoring a quickly acting mechanism that suppresses star
formation to explain the overall smaller fraction of SF galaxies in groups. If
galaxy-galaxy interactions are responsible, then the extremely low starburst
galaxy fraction (<1%) implies a short timescale (~0.1 Gyr) for any
merger-induced starburst stage. Comparison to two rich clusters shows that
clusters contain a population of massive SF galaxies with very low SFR (14% of
all the galaxies with M*>10^10 Msun), possibly as a consequence of ram pressure
stripping being less efficient in removing gas from more massive galaxies.

a Type Ia supernova photosphere to detect extra-galactic ISM column density
variations on spatial scales of ~100 AU on time scales of a few months.
  METHODS. We constructed a simple model which describes the expansion of the
photodisk and the effects of a patchy interstellar cloud on the observed
equivalent width of Na I D lines. Using this model we derived the behavior of
the equivalent width as a function of time, spatial scale and amplitude of the
column density fluctuations.
  RESULTS. The calculations show that isolated, small (<100 AU) clouds with Na
I column densities exceeding a few 10^11 cm^-2 would be easily detected. In
contrast, the effects of a more realistic, patchy ISM become measurable in a
fraction of cases, and for peak-to-peak variations larger than ~10^12 cm^-2 on
a scale of 1000 AU.
  CONCLUSIONS. The proposed technique provides a unique way to probe the
extra-galactic small scale structure, which is out of reach for any of the
methods used so far. The same tool can also be applied to study the sub-AU

space-times with symmetric connections. They are based on ideas of Weyl,
Eddington and Einstein and, in particular, on Einstein's proposal to specify
the space - time geometry by use of the Hamilton principle. More specifically,
the connection coefficients are derived by varying a `geometric' Lagrangian
that is supposed to be an arbitrary function of the generalized (non-symmetric)
Ricci curvature tensor (and, possibly, of other fundamental tensors) expressed
in terms of the connection coefficients regarded as independent variables. In
addition to the standard Einstein gravity, such a theory predicts dark energy
(the cosmological constant, in the first approximation), a neutral massive (or,
tachyonic) vector field, and massive (or, tachyonic) scalar fields. These
fields couple only to gravity and may generate dark matter and/or inflation.
The masses (real or imaginary) have geometric origin and one cannot avoid their
appearance in any concrete model. Further details of the theory - such as the
nature of the vector and scalar fields that can describe massive particles,
tachyons, or even `phantoms' - depend on the concrete choice of the geometric
Lagrangian. In `natural' geometric theories, which are discussed here, dark
energy is also unavoidable. Main parameters - mass, cosmological constant,
possible dimensionless constants - cannot be predicted, but, in the framework
of modern `multiverse' ideology, this is rather a virtue than a drawback of the
theory. To better understand possible applications of the theory we discuss
some further extensions of the affine models and analyze in more detail
approximate (`physical') Lagrangians that can be applied to cosmology of the
early Universe.

the optical emission properties of isolated neutron stars. PSRB0540-69, the
second brightest (V~22) optical pulsar, is obviously a very interesting target
for these investigations. The aim of this work is threefold: constraining the
pulsar proper motion and its velocity on the plane of the sky through optical
astrometry, obtaining a more precise characterisation of the pulsar optical
spectral energy distribution (SED) through a consistent set of multi-band,
high-resolution, imaging photometry observations, measuring the pulsar optical
phase-averaged linear polarisation, for which only a preliminary and uncertain
measurement was obtained so far from ground-based observations. We performed
high-resolution observations of PSRB0540-69 with the WFPC2 aboard the HST, in
both direct imaging and polarimetry modes. From multi-epoch astrometry we set a
3sigma upper limit of 1 mas/yr on the pulsar proper motion, implying a
transverse velocity <250 km/s at the 50 kpc LMC distance. Moreover, we
determined the pulsar absolute position with an unprecedented accuracy of 70
mas. From multi-band photometry we characterised the pulsar power-law spectrum
and we derived the most accurate measurement of the spectral index
(0.70+/-0.07) which indicates a spectral turnover between the optical and X-ray
bands. Finally, from polarimetry we obtained a new measurement of the pulsar
phase-averaged polarisation degree (16+/-4%),consistent with magnetosphere
models depending on the actual intrinsic polarisation degree and depolarisation
factor, and we found that the polarisation vector (22+/-12deg position angle)
is possibly aligned with the semi-major axis of the pulsar-wind nebula and with
the apparent proper motion direction of its bright emission knot.

  In absence of flexibility, the shortening of production of a single firm in
an isolated network with multiple connections usually ends up by attaining a
finite fraction of the firms or the whole economy, whereas the interactions
with the outside allow a partial recovering of the activity, giving rise to
periodic solutions with waves of damage which propagate across the structure.
The damage propagation speed is strongly dependent upon the topology. The
existence of multiple concurrent production paths does not necessarily imply a
slowing down of the propagation, which can be as fast as the shortest path.

is central to our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution.
Hyper-Luminous Infrared Galaxies (HLIRGs) are unique laboratories to
investigate the connection between starburst (SB) and Active Galactic Nuclei
(AGN), since they exhibit extreme star formation rates, and most of them show
evidence of harbouring powerful AGN. Our previous X-ray study of a sample of 14
HLIRGs shows that the X-ray emission of most HLIRGs is dominated by AGN
activity. To improve our estimate of the relative contribution of the AGN and
SB emission to its total bolometric output, we have built broad band spectral
energy distributions (SEDs) for these HLIRGs, and we have fitted empirical AGN
and SB templates to these SEDs. In broad terms, most sources are well fitted
using this method, and we found AGN and SB contributions similar to those
obtained by previous studies of HLIRGs. We have classified the HLIRGs SEDs in
two groups, named class A and class B. Class A HLIRGs show a flat SED from the
optical to the infrared energy range. Three out of seven class A sources can be
modelled with a pure luminosity-dependent QSO template, while the rest of them
require a type 1 AGN template and a SB template. The SB component is dominant
in three out of four class A objects. Class B HLIRGs show SEDs with a prominent
and broad IR bump. These sources can not trivially be modelled with a
combination of pure AGN and pure SB, they require templates of composite
objects, suggesting that >50% of their emission comes from stellar formation
processes. We propose that our sample is actually composed by three different
populations: very luminous QSO, young galaxies going through their maximal star
formation period and the high luminosity tail of ULIRG population distribution.

complex physical experiments. Although less expensive than physical
experimentation, computer codes can still be time-consuming to run. An
effective strategy for exploring the response surface of the deterministic
simulator is the use of an approximation to the computer code, such as a
Gaussian process (GP) model, coupled with a sequential sampling strategy for
choosing design points that can be used to build the GP model. The ultimate
goal of such studies is often the estimation of specific features of interest
of the simulator output, such as the maximum, minimum, or a level set
(contour). Before approximating such features with the GP model, sufficient
runs of the computer simulator must be completed.
  Sequential designs with an expected improvement (EI) function can yield good
estimates of the features with a minimal number of runs. The challenge is that
the expected improvement function itself is often multimodal and difficult to
maximize. We develop branch and bound algorithms for efficiently maximizing the
EI function in specific problems, including the simultaneous estimation of a
minimum and a maximum, and in the estimation of a contour. These branch and
bound algorithms outperform other optimization strategies such as genetic
algorithms, and over a number of sequential design steps can lead to
dramatically superior accuracy in estimation of features of interest.

has progressed significantly in the last decades, thanks to the improvement of

benefit from the absence of atmospheric absorption, allowing to reach the very
high sensitivities needed to perform 3D hyperspectral observations, but
telescopes are limited in diameter ($< 1$ meter) and therefore provide
observations at low angular resolution (typically a few seconds of arc). On the

vector of angular velocity $\vec{\Omega}$ along direction of neutron star
magnetic dipole moment $\vec{m}$ with angular velocity $\vec{\Omega}_{p}$. This
process may cause the altering of electric current flow through inner gap and
consequently the current losses with the same time scale as precession period
$T_{p} = 2\pi / \Omega_{p}$. It occurs because of electric current in inner
gaps is determined by Goldreich-Julian charge density $\rho_{GJ} =
-\frac{\vec{\Omega} \cdot \vec{B}}{2\pi c}$, which are depend on angle between
direction of small scale magnetic field and angular velocity $\vec{\Omega}$. It
is essential that pulsar tubes nearby neutron star surface are curved. In
current paper it is considered the only inner gaps with steady, electron charge
limited flow regime.

sufficient strength to permit tunnel ionization of the valence electrons in

events, in which the states of the remaining electrons are neglected. Such
electronic interactions are predicted to be weak, the exception being
recollision excitation and ionization caused by linearly-polarized radiation.
In contrast, it has recently been suggested that intense field ionization may
be accompanied by a two-stage `shake-up' reaction. Here we report a unique
combination of experimental techniques that enables us to accurately measure
the tunnel ionization probability for argon exposed to 50 femtosecond laser
pulses. Most significantly for the current study, this measurement is
independent of the optical focal geometry, equivalent to a homogenous electric
field. Furthermore, circularly-polarized radiation negates recollision. The
present measurements indicate that tunnel ionization results in simultaneous
excitation of one or more remaining electrons through shake-up. From an atomic
physics standpoint, it may be possible to induce ionization from specific
states, and will influence the development of coherent attosecond XUV radiation
sources. Such pulses have vital scientific and economic potential in areas such
as high-resolution imaging of in-vivo cells and nanoscale XUV lithography.

an artificial viscosity contribution or an appropriate Riemann solver
algorithm. These techniques are necessary to solve the strictly hyperbolic
Euler equations if flow discontinuities (the Riemann problem) are to be solved.
A necessary dissipation is normally used in such cases. An explicit artificial
viscosity contribution is normally adopted to smooth out spurious heating and
to treat transport phenomena. Such a treatment of inviscid flows is also widely
adopted in the Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) finite volume free
Lagrangian scheme. In other cases, the intrinsic dissipation of Godunov-type
methods is implicitly useful. Instead ""shock tracking"" methods normally use the
Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions to solve such problems. A simple, effective
solution of the Riemann problem in inviscid ideal gases is here proposed, based
on an empirical reformulation of the equation of state (EoS) in the Euler
equations in fluid dynamics, whose limit for a motionless gas coincides with
the classical EoS of ideal gases. The application of such an effective solution
to the Riemann problem excludes any dependence, in the transport phenomena, on
particle smoothing resolution length $h$ in non viscous SPH flows. Results on
1D shock tube tests, as well as examples of application for 2D turbulence and
2D shear flows are here shown. As an astrophysical application, a much better
identification of spiral structures in accretion discs in a close binary (CB),

a pixel sensitivity of 1.2 mJy per 22 arcsec beam. After correction for flux

flux arises from two images of a galaxy magnified by a total factor of 75, as

RATAN-600 radio telescope at 7.6 cm in 1988-1999 at the declination of the
SS433 source. We also reprocess the data of the ""Cold"" survey (1980-1981). The
resulting RCR (RATAN COLD REFINED) catalog contains the right ascensions and
fluxes of objects identified with those of the NVSS catalog in the
right-ascension interval 7h < R.A. < 17h. We obtain the spectra of the radio
sources and determine their spectral indices at 3.94 and 0.5 GHz. The spectra
are based on the data from all known catalogs available from the CATS, Vizier,
and NED databases, and the flux estimates inferred from the maps of the VLSS
and GB6 surveys. For 245 of the 550 objects of the RCR catalog the fluxes are
known at two frequencies only: 3.94 GHz (RCR) and 1.4 GHz (NVSS). These are
mostly sources with fluxes smaller than 30 mJy. About 65% of these sources have
flat or inverse spectra (alpha > -0.5). We analyze the reliability of the
results obtained for the entire list of objects and construct the histograms of
the spectral indices and fluxes of the sources. Our main conclusion is that all
10-15 mJy objects found in the considered right-ascension interval were already
included in the decimeter-wave catalogs.

coevolution of the LCDM dark halo mass function (HMF), the observationally
derived velocity dispersion and stellar mass functions (VDF, SMF) of galaxies
between z=1 and 0. We use for the first time the evolution of the VDF
constrained through strong lensing statistics by Chae (2010) for galaxy-halo
abundance matching studies. As a local benchmark we use a couple of z ~ 0 VDFs
(a Monte-Carlo realised VDF based on SDSS DR5 and a directly measured VDF based
on SDSS DR6). We then focus on connecting the VDF evolution to the HMF
evolution predicted by N-body simulations and the SMF evolution constrained by
galaxy surveys. On the VDF-HMF connection, we find that the local dark halo
virial mass-central stellar velocity dispersion (Mvir-sigma) relation is in
good agreement with the individual properties of well-studied low-redshift dark
haloes, and the VDF evolution closely parallels the HMF evolution meaning
little evolution in the Mvir-sigma relation. On the VDF-SMF connection, it is
also likely that the stellar mass-stellar velocity dispersion (Mstar-sigma)
relation evolves little taking the abundance matching results together with
other independent observational results and hydrodynamic simulation results.
Our results support the simple picture that as the halo grows hierarchically,
the stellar mass and the central stellar velocity dispersion grow in parallel.
We discuss possible implications of this parallel coevolution for galaxy
formation and evolution under the LCDM paradigm.

based on MRI revealed significant anomalies in IS patients compared to normal
subjects. - Frequent aplasias located in the lateral canal were found in IS. -
We also discovered a, never described, abnormal communication between lateral

address the problem of classification in partially labeled networks. The basic
assumption is that two nodes are more likely to be categorized into the same
class if they are more similar. In this paper, we introduce ten similarity
indices, including five local ones and five global ones. Empirical results on
the co-purchase network of political books show that the similarity-based
method can give high accurate classification even when the labeled nodes are
sparse which is one of the difficulties in classification. Furthermore, we find
that when the target network has many labeled nodes, the local indices can
perform as good as those global indices do, while when the data is sparce the
global indices perform better. Besides, the similarity-based method can to some
extent overcome the unconsistency problem which is another difficulty in
classification.

bubbles, we study the role that dust can play in such environments, and build
an approximate model of a particular wind-blown bubble, `N49.' First, we model
the observations with a dusty wind-blown bubble, and then ask whether dust
could survive within N49 to its present age (estimated to be 5x10^5 to 10^6
years). We find that dust sputtering and especially dust-gas friction would
imply relatively short timescales (t ~ 10^4 years) for dust survival in the
wind-shocked region of the bubble. To explain the 24 micron emission, we
postulate that the grains are replenished within the wind-blown bubble by
destruction of embedded, dense cloudlets of ISM gas that have been over-run by
the expanding wind-blown bubble. We calculate the ablation timescales for
cloudlets within N49 and find approximate parameters for the embedded cloudlets
that can replenish the dust; the parameters for the cloudlets are roughly
similar to those observed in other nebula. Such dust will have an important
effect on the bubble: including simple dust cooling in a wind-blown bubble
model for N49, we find that the luminosity is higher by approximately a factor
of six at a bubble age of about 10^4 years. At ages of 10^7 years, the energy
contained in the bubble is lower by about a factor of eight if dust is
included; if dust must be replenished within the bubble, the associated
accompanying gas mass will also be very important to wind-blown bubble cooling
and evolution. While more detailed models are certainly called for, this work
illustrates the possible strong importance of dust in wind-blown bubbles, and
is a first step toward models of dusty, wind-blown bubbles.
