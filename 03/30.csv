naturally as sl(2,C)-modules. As finite-dimensional irreducible
sl(2,C)-modules, they have canonical bases which are, by construction,
orthogonal. In this note, we show that these orthogonal bases form the Appell
system and coincide with those constructed recently by S. Bock and K.
Guerlebeck. Moreover, we obtain simple expressions of elements of these bases
in terms of the Legendre polynomials.

SiIV 1400A absorption variation. We compare shorter- and longer-term
variability using spectra from up to four different epochs per source and find
complex patterns of variation in the sample overall. The scatter in the change
of absorption equivalent width (EW), Delta EW, increases with the time between
observations. BALs do not, in general, strengthen or weaken monotonically, and
variation observed over shorter (<months) time scales is not predictive of
multi-year variation. We find no evidence for asymmetry in the distribution of
Delta EW that would indicate that BALs form and decay on different time scales,
and we constrain the typical BAL lifetime to be >~30 yr. The BAL absorption for
one source, LBQS 0022+0150, has weakened and may now be classified as a
mini-BAL. Another source, 1235+1453, shows evidence of variable, blue continuum
emission that is relatively unabsorbed by the BAL outflow. CIV and SiIV BAL
shape changes are related in at least some sources. Given their high
velocities, BAL outflows apparently traverse large spatial regions and may
interact with parsec-scale structures such as an obscuring torus. Assuming BAL
outflows are launched from a rotating accretion disk, notable azimuthal
symmetry is required in the outflow to explain the relatively small changes
observed in velocity structure over times up to 7 yr.

Dededekind's axiomatisation of Peano's Postulates. The latter concerns how a

construction, called ""2-linearization"", and extended topological quantum field
theory (ETQFT). We then describe an extension of the 2-linearization process
which incorporates cohomological twisting. The 2-linearization process assigns
2-vector spaces to (finite) groupoids, functors between them to spans of
groupoids, and natural transformations to spans between these. By applying this
to groupoids which represent the (discrete) moduli spaces for topological gauge
theory with finite group G, the ETQFT obtained is the untwisted
Dijkgraaf-Witten (DW) model associated to G. This illustrates the factorization
of TQFT into ""classical field theory"" valued in groupoids, and ""quantization
functors"", which has been described by Freed, Hopkins, Lurie and Teleman. We
then describe how to extend this to the full DW model, by using a
generalization of the symmetric monoidal bicategory of groupoids and spans
which incorporates cocycles. We give a generalization of the 2-linearization
functor which acts on groupoids and spans which have associated cohomological
data. We show how the 3-cocycle {\omega} on the classifying space BG which
appears in the action for the DW model induces a classical field theory valued

features of emotions such as the spontaneous emotional arousal, emotional
relaxation, and transfers of emotions between different agents. Group emotions
in the considered models are periodically fluctuating between two opposite
valency levels and as result the mean value of such group emotions is zero. The
oscillations amplitude depends strongly on probability ps of the individual
spontaneous arousal. For small values of relaxation times tau we observed a
stochastic resonance, i.e. the signal to noise ratio SNR is maximal for a
non-zero ps parameter. The amplitude increases with the probability p of local
affective interactions while the mean oscillations period increases with the
relaxation time tau and is only weakly dependent on other system parameters.
Presence of emotional antenna can enhance positive or negative emotions and for
the optimal transition probability the antenna can change agents emotions at
longer distances. The stochastic resonance was also observed for the influence
of emotions on task execution efficiency.

the lack of photons. That is why we need a powerful Poisson noise removal
method on the sphere which is efficient on low count Poisson data. This paper
presents a new multiscale decomposition on the sphere for data with Poisson
noise, called Multi-Scale Variance Stabilizing Transform on the Sphere
(MS-VSTS). This method is based on a Variance Stabilizing Transform (VST), a
transform which aims to stabilize a Poisson data set such that each stabilized
sample has a quasi constant variance. In addition, for the VST used in the
method, the transformed data are asymptotically Gaussian. MS-VSTS consists of
decomposing the data into a sparse multi-scale dictionary like wavelets or
curvelets, and then applying a VST on the coefficients in order to get almost
Gaussian stabilized coefficients. In this work, we use the Isotropic
Undecimated Wavelet Transform (IUWT) and the Curvelet Transform as spherical
multi-scale transforms. Then, binary hypothesis testing is carried out to
detect significant coefficients, and the denoised image is reconstructed with
an iterative algorithm based on Hybrid Steepest Descent (HSD). To detect point
sources, we have to extract the Galactic diffuse background: an extension of
the method to background separation is then proposed. In contrary, to study the
Milky Way diffuse background, we remove point sources with a binary mask. The
gaps have to be interpolated: an extension to inpainting is then proposed. The
method, applied on simulated Fermi LAT data, proves to be adaptive, fast and
easy to implement.

new opportunities for next generation of mobile services. It becomes more
convenience and desirable for mobile internet users to be connected everywhere.
However, ubiquitous mobile access connectivity faces interoperation issues
between wireless network providers and wireless network technologies. Although
mobile users would like to get as many services as possible while they travel,
there is a lack of technology to identify visited users in current foreign
network authentication systems. This challenge lies in the fact that a foreign
network provider does not initially have the authentication credentials of a
mobile user. Existing approaches use roaming agreement to exchange
authentication information between home network and foreign network. This paper
proposes a roaming agreement-less approach designed based on our ubiquitous
mobile access model. Our approach consist of two tokens, Passport
(identification token) and Visa (authorisation token) to provide the mobile
user with a flexible authentication method to access foreign network services.
The security analysis indicates that our proposal is more suitable for
ubiquitous mobile communication especially in roaming agreement-less
environment.

the superpotential and by including Coleman-Weinberg corrections to the scalar
potential. Instead, we consider these ideas from the perspective of the one
loop effective Kahler potential. We translate known ideas to this framework and
construct convenient formulas for computing individual terms in the expanded
effective Kahler potential. We do so for arbitrary R-charge assignments and
allow for small R-symmetry violating terms so that both spontaneous and
explicit R-symmetry breaking is allowed in our analysis.

exhibit power suppression of the quantum loop corrections from these massive
fields. Quintessence fields in the dark energy regime and inflaton fields
during inflation often have a very large background field value. Thus any other
field with its mass dependent on the quintessence/inflaton background field
value through a moderate coupling will become very massive during the dark
energy/inflation phase and its quantum corrections to the scalar effective
potential will be suppressed. This concept is developed in this paper using the
decoupling theorem. The problem then reduces to a quantitative question of the
size of suppression effects within the parameter space of coupling constants,
scalar field background value and renormalization scale. Some numerical
examples are presented both for inflation and quintessence, but the approach is
general and can be applied to any scalar field effective potential. The
consequences to dark energy of the decoupling effect developed here is that the
quintessence field need not just be an incredibly weakly interacting field,
often added as simply an add-on to generate dark energy and have no other
purpose. Instead, this quintessence field could play a central role in the
particle physics dynamics at early times and then simply decouple at late times
before the onset of the dark energy phase. For inflation a consequence is
coupling of the inflaton to other fields can be much larger in certain models,
without needing supersymmetry to control quantum corrections.

pnictides, the parent compound Fe1+yTe exhibits antiferromagnetic order with
in-plane magnetic wave-vector (pi, 0). This contrasts the pnictide parent
compounds where the magnetic order has an in-plane magnetic wave-vector (pi,
pi) that connects hole and electron parts of the Fermi surface. Despite these
differences, both the pnictide and chalcogenide Fe-superconductors exhibit
superconducting spin resonances around (pi, pi), suggesting a common symmetry
for their superconducting order parameter. A central question in this
burgeoning field is therefore how (pi, pi) superconductivity can emerge from a
(pi, 0) magnetic instability. Here, we report that the magnetic soft mode
evolving from the (pi, 0)-type magnetic long-range order is associated with
weak charge carrier localization. Bulk superconductivity occurs only as the

force. The net centrifugal force changes sign at three Schwarzschild radii,
which interestingly mimics the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) of the

After properly accounting for the effects of finite dust-filament extent and

having the blueshifted He I and H alpha features is roughly in the direction of
an Fe-rich outflow and in the opposite direction of the motion of the compact
object at the center of the SNR. We conclude that Cas A was an intrinsically
asymmetric SN. Future LE spectroscopy of this object, and of other historical

electroweak symmetry breaking arising from embedding in string theory. RS is
dual to a confining gauge theory, which we expect to have ""QCD strings,"" or
color flux tubes. Stringy constructions of RS-like theories allow us to
investigate the mass of these string states, which typically grows with a small
fractional power of the number of colors N of the dual gauge theory. There are
two known strong constraints on N for RS-like theories. The first arises from
demanding that the Standard Model gauge couplings do not have a Landau pole at
low scales. The second arises from demanding that the first-order confining
phase transition in the early universe is able to proceed without leaving an
empty universe, i.e. that the rate of bubble nucleation is not too small. We
find that these constraints on N imply that string states are generically at
most a factor of a few heavier than the lightest KK states, and we cannot
self-consistently remain in the limit N, lambda >> 1. We examine various string
constructions of AdS or RS-like backgrounds, including orbifolds, theories on
M5-branes, theories on D4-branes, and the recent F-theory construction of
Polchinski and Silverstein. In every case we find that there are strong bounds
on the mass of new stringy states. We briefly discuss important
phenomenological implications due to the presence of such light stringy
excitations, such as precision electroweak and flavor observables, as well as
collider signals.

on a harmonic space can not be determined by the spectra of local geodesic
spheres or balls, therefore the main results of [AM-S] (quoted in the title)
are wrong. My strong interest in the above theorem is motivated by the fact
that it contradicts some of my isospectrality examples constructed on geodesic
spheres and balls of certain harmonic manifolds. The authors overlooked that
the Lichnerowicz identity is not determined by the given spectral data, and so
is the final crucial equation obtained by eliminating with the Lichnerowicz
identity. In short, the above theorem has falsely been established by
spectrally undetermined identities which can not be computed (determined) by
the spectra of local geodesic spheres. More complicated spectrally undetermined
functions cause the problems also in case of local geodesic balls. I describe
also a strong physical argument which clearly explains why the manifolds
appearing in my examples are isospectral. It must be pointed out, however, that
a very remarkable new idea, namely, the asymptotic expansion of the heat
invariants $a_k(p,r)$ defined on geodesic spheres, $S_p(r)$, is introduced in
the paper. It can be used for developing both geometric uncertainty theory and
global vs. local spectral investigations. Among my contributions to this
developing field is the following statement: Average volumes, $\int
vol(B_p(r))dp$ resp. $\int vol(S_p(r))dp$, of geodesic balls resp. spheres are
generically not determined by the spectra of compact Riemann manifolds. This
theorem interestingly contrasts the statement asserting that the volume of the
whole manifold can be determined in terms of this global spectrum. We also
have: Music written for local drums can not be played, in general, on the whole
manifold.

probability measures on a countably infinite set. The I-topology is finer than
the norm topology, it disconnects the convex state space into its faces. The
rI-topology is intermediate between these topologies. We complete two
fundamental theorems of information geometry to the full state space, by taking
the closure in the rI-topology. The norm topology is too coarse for this aim
only for a non-commutative algebra, so its discrepancy to the rI-topology
belongs to the quantum domain. We apply our results to the maximization of the

a wide variety of broken-symmetry states in which the pseudospins associated
these three quantum numbers order in a manner that is dependent on both filling

limit that the size of the system is taken to infinity at constant particle
density, i.e., in the ""usual"" thermodynamic limit. For a pair interaction
potential V(r) with V(r) \rightarrow \infty) \sim 1/r^a defining a {\it
bounded} pair force, we show that P(F) converges continuously to a well-defined
and rapidly decreasing PDF if and only if the {\it pair force} is absolutely
integrable, i.e., for a > d-1, where d is the spatial dimension. We refer to
this case as {\it dynamically short-range}, because the dominant contribution
to the force on a typical particle in this limit arises from particles in a
finite neighborhood around it. For the {\it dynamically long-range} case, i.e.,
a \leq d-1, on the other hand, the dominant contribution to the force comes
from the mean field due to the bulk, which becomes undefined in this limit. We
discuss also how, for a \leq d-1 (and notably, for the case of gravity, a=d-2)
P(F) may, in some cases, be defined in a weaker sense. This involves a
regularization of the force summation which is generalization of the procedure
employed to define gravitational forces in an infinite static homogeneous
universe. We explain that the relevant classification in this context is,
however, that which divides pair forces with a > d-2 (or a < d-2), for which
the PDF of the {\it difference in forces} is defined (or not defined) in the
infinite system limit, without any regularization. In the former case dynamics
can, as for the (marginal) case of gravity, be defined consistently in an

three-dimensional spatially resolved inner ejecta. Detailed mapping of newly
synthesised material and its radioactive decay daughter products sheds light on
the explosion mechanism. This may reveal the geometry of the explosion and its
connection to the equatorial ring and the outer rings around SN 1987A. We have
used integral field spectroscopy to image the supernova ejecta and the
equatorial ring in the emission lines of [Si I]+[Fe II] and He I. The spectral
information can be mapped into a radial velocity image revealing the expansion
of the ejecta both as projected onto the sky and perpendicular to the sky
plane. The inner ejecta are spatially resolved in a North-South direction and
are clearly asymmetric. We argue that the bulk of the ejecta is situated in the
same plane as defined by the equatorial ring and does not form a bipolar
structure as has been suggested. The exact shape of the ejecta is modelled and
we find that an elongated triaxial ellipsoid fits the observations best. From
our spectral analyses of the ejecta spectrum we find that most of the He I, [Si
I] and [Fe I-II] emission originates in the core material which has undergone
explosive nucleosynthesis. The He I emission may be the result of alpha-rich
freeze-out if the positron energy is deposited locally. Our observations
clearly indicate a non-symmetric explosion mechanism for SN 1987A. The
elongation and velocity asymmetries point towards a large-scale spatial
non-spherical distribution as predicted in recent explosion models. The
orientation of the ejecta in the plane of the equatorial ring argues against a
jet-induced explosion through the poles due to stellar rotation.

It provides a strong consistency test for fermion formulations in lattice QCD.
Such tests are especially important for staggered fermion formulations that
lack a full chiral symmetry and use the ""fourth-root"" procedure to achieve the
desired number of sea quarks. Over the past few years we have measured the
topological susceptibility on a large database of 18 gauge field ensembles,

down quark masses ranging from 0.05 to 1 in units of the strange quark mass and
lattice spacings ranging from 0.045 fm to 0.12 fm. Our study also includes
three quenched ensembles with lattice spacings ranging from 0.06 to 0.12 fm. We
construct the topological susceptibility from the integrated point-to-point
correlator of the discretized topological charge density F-Fdual. To reduce its
variance, we model the asymptotic tail of the correlator. The continuum
extrapolation of our results for the topological susceptibility agrees nicely
at small quark mass with the predictions of lowest-order SU(3) chiral
perturbation theory, thus lending support to the validity of the fourth-root

regular satellites, there are irregular satellites (and at least one irregular

double-peaked Balmer emission lines,which represent some of the best evidence
for the existence of relatively large-scale accretion disks in AGNs. A set of
20 double-peaked emitters have been monitored for nearly a decade in order to
observe long-term variations in the profiles of the double-peaked Balmer lines.
Variations generally occur on timescales of years, and are attributed to
physical changes in the accretion disk. Here we characterize the variability of
a subset of seven double-peaked emitters in a model independent way. We find
that variability is caused primarily by the presence of one or more discrete
""lumps"" of excess emission; over a timescale of a year (and sometimes less)
these lumps change in amplitude and shape, but the projected velocity of these
lumps changes over much longer timescales (several years). We also find that
all of the objects exhibit red peaks that are stronger than the blue peak at
some epochs and/or blueshifts in the overall profile, contrary to the
expectations for a simple, circular accretion disk model, thus emphasizing the
need for asymmetries in the accretion disk. Comparisons with two simple models,
an elliptical accretion disk and a circular disk with a spiral arm, are unable
to reproduce all aspects of the observed variability, although both account for
some of the observed behaviors. Three of the seven objects have robust
estimates of the black hole masses. For these objects the observed variability
timescale is consistent with the expected precession timescale for a spiral
arm, but incompatible with that of an elliptical accretion disk. We suggest
that with the simple modification of allowing the spiral arm to be fragmented,
many of the observed variability patterns could be reproduced.

now potentially allow us to explore the stellar interior of these accretors

on the accreting pulsator SDSS J161033.64-010223.3 (V386 Ser) using seven
observatories located around the world in May 2007 over a duration of 11 days.
We report the best fit periodicities here, which were also previously observed
in 2004, suggesting their underlying stability. Although we did not uncover a
sufficient number of independent pulsation modes for a unique seismological
fit, our campaign revealed that the dominant pulsation mode at 609s is an
evenly spaced triplet. The even nature of the triplet is suggestive of
rotational splitting, implying an enigmatic rotation period of about 4.8 days.
There are two viable alternatives assuming the triplet is real: either the
period of 4.8 days is representative of the rotation period of the entire star
with implications for the angular momentum evolution of these systems, or it is
perhaps an indication of differential rotation with a fast rotating exterior
and slow rotation deeper in the star. Investigating the possibility that a
changing period could mimic a triplet suggests that this scenario is
improbable, but not impossible.
  Using time-series spectra acquired in May 2009, we determine the orbital
period of SDSS J161033.64-010223.3 to be 83.8 +/- 2.9 min. Three of the
observed photometric frequencies from our May 2007 campaign appear to be linear
combinations of the 609s pulsation mode with the first harmonic of the orbital
period at 41.5min. This is the first discovery of a linear combination between
nonradial pulsation and orbital motion for a variable white dwarf.

decomposition of the solution. This iteration bound is different than the one
used earlier in the work of Bourgain, and is less dependent on the structure of
the nonlinearity. We first look at the defocusing NLS equation with
nonlinearity of degree $\geq 5$. For the quintic NLS, Bourgain derives stronger
bounds using different techniques. However, our approach works for higher
nonlinearities, where the techniques of Bourgain don't seem to apply.
Furthermore, we study variants of the defocusing cubic NLS in which the
complete integrability is broken. Among this class of equations, we consider in
particular the Hartree Equation, with sufficiently regular convolution
potential. For most of the equations that come from modifying the defocusing
cubic NLS, we obtain better bounds than for the other equations due to the fact

all Sobolev norms. For both equations, we derive our results by using an

of several thousand per year. Spectroscopic follow-up can only scratch the
surface for such enormous samples, so these extensive data sets will only be
useful to the extent that they can be characterized by the survey photometry
alone. In a companion paper (Rodney and Tonry, 2009) we introduced the SOFT
method for analyzing SNe using direct comparison to template light curves, and
demonstrated its application for photometric SN classification. In this work we
extend the SOFT method to derive estimates of redshift and luminosity distance
for Type Ia SNe, using light curves from the SDSS and SNLS surveys as a
validation set. Redshifts determined by SOFT using light curves alone are
consistent with spectroscopic redshifts, showing a root-mean-square scatter in
the residuals of RMS_z=0.051. SOFT can also derive simultaneous redshift and
distance estimates, yielding results that are consistent with the currently
favored Lambda-CDM cosmological model. When SOFT is given spectroscopic
information for SN classification and redshift priors, the RMS scatter in
Hubble diagram residuals is 0.18 mags for the SDSS data and 0.28 mags for the
SNLS objects. Without access to any spectroscopic information, and even without
any redshift priors from host galaxy photometry, SOFT can still measure
reliable redshifts and distances, with an increase in the Hubble residuals to
0.37 mags for the combined SDSS and SNLS data set. Using Monte Carlo
simulations we predict that SOFT will be able to improve constraints on
time-variable dark energy models by a factor of 2-3 with each new generation of
large-scale SN surveys.

population of much smaller icy moons. We have investigated the origin of these
major differences between the Jovian and Saturnian satellite systems by
semi-analytically simulating the growth and orbital migration of
proto-satellites in an accreting proto-satellite disk. We set up two different
disk evolution/structure models that correspond to Jovian and Saturnian
systems, by building upon previously developed models of an actively-supplied
proto-satellite disk, the formation of gas giants, and observations of young
stars. Our simulations extend previous models by including the (1) different
termination timescales of gas infall onto the proto-satellite disk and (2)
different evolution of a cavity in the disk, between the Jovian and Saturnian
systems. We have performed Monte Carlo simulations and show that in the case of
the Jovian systems, four to five similar-mass satellites are likely to remain
trapped in mean motion resonances. This orbital configuration is formed by type
I migration, temporal stopping of the migration near the disk inner edge, and
quick truncation of gas infall caused by Jupiter opening a gap in the Solar
nebula. The Saturnian systems tend to end up with one dominant body in the
outer regions caused by the slower decay of gas infall associated with global
depletion of the Solar nebula. The total mass and compositional zoning of the
predicted Jovian and Saturnian satellite systems are consistent with the
observed satellite systems.

gravitational fragmentation of larger structures and coalescence of smaller
entities which are formed from some instabilities. Here, we turn our attention
to the latter idea to investigate the evolution of observed low-mass
condensations (LMCs) in the cores of molecular clouds. For this purpose, we
implement the evolution of the observed LMCs of Taurus molecular cloud~1
(TMC-1). The core is modeled as a contracting cylinder with randomly spawned
condensations in the middle region around its axis. For advancing bodies in
their trajectories, we represent the acceleration of a particular LMC in terms
of a fourth-order polynomial using the predictor-corrector scheme. Whenever two
LMCs collide, they are assumed to be merged in one large condensation
containing all the masses of the two progenitors. Implementations of many
computer experiments with a wide variety of the free parameters show that the
LMCs merge to form star-forming regions in the core. The results show that the
total mechanical energy of the core increases by time, and its rate of
increasing decreases by facilitating the merger. Finally, the mass spectrum
index and goodness-of-fit are determined with 50% error in the number of mass
points. The results show that the goodness-of-fit will be refined at the end of
simulations, and the mass spectrum index inclines to the observed values for
the moderate mass objects. The simulations show that the TMC-1 turns about 40%
of its mass into cluster of dynamically unstable protostellar cores. In
general, we suggest that the future of LMCs in a core of molecular cloud is
merger to convert about half of its initial masses into a cluster of
gravitationally unstable protostellar cores.

to study a single realization of the measurement process while keeping track of

In the free field model, these coefficients arise only with a special

also be regarded as a relation between the $3j$-symbols of the Virasoro algebra

which the present accelerating stage is powered only by the gravitationally
induced creation of cold dark matter (CCDM) particles ($\Omega_{m}=1$). For
some matter creation rates proposed in the literature, we show that the main
cosmological functions such as the scale factor of the universe, the Hubble
expansion rate, the growth factor and the cluster formation rate are
analytically defined. The best CCDM scenario has only one free parameter and
our joint analysis involving BAO + CMB + SNe Ia data yields
${\tilde{\Omega}}_{m}= 0.28\pm 0.01$ ($1\sigma$) where $\tilde{{\Omega}}_{m}$
is the observed matter density parameter. In particular, this implies that the
model has no dark energy but the part of the matter that is effectively
clustering is in good agreement with the latest determinations from large scale
structure. The growth of perturbation and the formation of galaxy clusters in
such scenarios are also investigated. Despite the fact that both scenarios may
share the same Hubble expansion, we find that matter creation cosmologies
predict stronger small scale dynamics which implies a faster growth rate of
perturbations with respect to the usual $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Such results
point to the possibility of a crucial observational test confronting CCDM with
$\Lambda$CDM scenarios trough a more detailed analysis involving CMB, weak
lensing, as well as the large scale structure.

distances of GRBs by interpolating directly from the Hubble diagram of SNe Ia,
and then calibrating GRB relations at high redshift. In this paper, following
the basic assumption in the interpolation method that objects at the same
redshift should have the same luminosity distance, we propose another approach
to calibrate GRB luminosity relations with cosmographic fitting directly from
SN Ia data. In cosmography, there is a well-known fitting formula which can
reflect the Hubble relation between luminosity distance and redshift with
cosmographic parameters which can be fitted from observation data. Using the
Cosmographic fitting results from the Union set of SNe Ia, we calibrate five
GRB relations using GRB sample at $z\leq1.4$ and deduce distance moduli of GRBs
at $1.4< z \leq 6.6$ by generalizing above calibrated relations at high
redshift. Finally, we constrain the dark energy parameterization models of the
Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) model, the Jassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan (JBP)
model and the Alam model with GRB data at high redshift, as well as with the
Cosmic Microwave Background radiation (CMB) and the baryonic acoustic

transformations, and may be thought of as a kind of general solutions of the
hierarchy. The Riemann-Hilbert problem contains $M$ arbitrary functions
$H_a(z_0,z_a)$, $a = 1,...,M$, which play the role of generating functions of
two-dimensional canonical transformations. The solution of the Riemann-Hilbert
problem is described by period maps on the space of $(M+1)$-tuples
$(z_\alpha(p) : \alpha = 0,1,...,M)$ of conformal maps from $M$ disks of the
Riemann sphere and their complements to the Riemann sphere. The period maps are
defined by an infinite number of contour integrals that generalize the notion
of harmonic moments. The $F$-function (free energy) of these solutions is also
shown to have a contour integral representation.

In the network, the nodes have their own average throughput demands for

its probability of transmitting an RTS packet, which specifies the length of

different nodes in the same time slot interfere with one another, and compete
to be received by the base station. If a node's RTS has the received signal to

successfully received. The node will then be granted the data transmission
period. The transmission probabilities of RTS packets of all nodes will
determine the average throughput and power consumption of each node. The set of
all possible throughput demands of nodes that can be supported by the network

that this agreement is observed for galaxies with L$\rm_{IR}$ $>$ 10$^{12}$

required. The scope of the present work is the derivation of the structure of
IRAS16293-2422. Methods: We have re-analyzed all available continuum data
(single dish and interferometric, from millimeter to MIR) to derive accurate
density and dust temperature profiles. Using ISO observations of water, we have
also reconstructed the gas temperature profile. Results: Our analysis shows
that the envelope surrounding IRAS16293-2422 is well described by the Shu

Although IRAS16293-2422 is a multiple system composed by two or three objects,
our reconstruction will be useful to derive the chemical structure of the large
cold envelope surrounding these objects and the warm component, treated here as
a single source, from single-dish observations of molecular emission.

followed in a series of resistive MHD simulations. Results: It is found that,
following an instability within the loop, a myriad of thin current layers
forms, via a cascade-like process. This cascade becomes more developed and
continues for a longer period of time for higher magnetic Reynolds number.
During the cascade, magnetic flux is reconnected multiple times, with the level
of this `multiple reconnection' positively correlated with the magnetic
Reynolds number. Eventually the system evolves into a state with no more

the dynamical stability of the system. The age of this star has been estimated
using different procedures. In this work we show that some of these procedures
have problems and large uncertainties, and the real age of this star is still
unknown, needing more observational constraints. Therefore, we have developed a
comprehensive modeling of HR8799, and taking advantage of its gamma
Doradus-type pulsations, we have estimated the age of the star using
asteroseismology. The accuracy in the age determination depends on the rotation
velocity of the star, and therefore an accurate value of the inclination angle
is required to solve the problem. Nevertheless, we find that the age estimate
for this star previously published in the literature ([30,160] Myr) is
unlikely, and a more accurate value might be closer to the Gyr. This
determination has deep implications on the value of the mass of the objects
orbiting HR8799. An age around $\approx$ 1 Gyr implies that these objects are
brown dwarfs.

The size of the Internet becomes enormous, yet the network is very `small' in
the sense that it is extremely efficient to route data packets across the

properties of the Internet topology at the autonomous systems (AS) level.
Firstly the Internet has a power-law degree distribution, which means the
majority of nodes on the Internet AS graph have small numbers of links, whereas
a few nodes have very large numbers of links. Secondly the Internet exhibits a
property called disassortative mixing, which means poorly-connected nodes tend
to link with well-connected nodes, and vice versa. Thirdly the best-connected
nodes, or the rich nodes, are tightly interconnected with each other forming a
rich-club. We explain that it is these structural properties that make the

out the phase diagram in the (mu,T) plane. The action of QCD is complex in the
presence of a non-zero quark chemical potential which results in the sign

temperatures becomes a conventional unitary matrix model with a complex action,
we find that the dominant contribution to the functional integral comes from

Polyakov line lie off the unit circle on a contour in the complex plane. We
find at low temperatures that as mu passes one of the quark energy levels there
is a third-order Gross-Witten transition from a confined to a deconfined phase
and back again giving rise to a rich phase structure. We compare a range of
physical observables in the large N theory to those calculated numerically in
the theory with N=3. In the latter case there are no genuine phase transitions
in a finite volume but nevertheless the observables are remarkably similar to
the large N theory.

catastrophic disruption of a large precursor body, which is the process that
formed families around much smaller asteroids in the Main Belt. Here we show
that all of the unusual characteristics of the Haumea system are explained by a
novel type of giant collision: a graze-and-merge impact between two comparably

spun off fragments from the icy crust of the elongated merged body. The
fragments became satellites and family members. Giant collision outcomes are
extremely sensitive to the impact parameters. Compared to the Main Belt, the
largest bodies in the Kuiper Belt are more massive and experience slower
velocity collisions; hence, outcomes of giant collisions are dramatically
different between the inner and outer solar system. The dwarf planets in the
Kuiper Belt record an unexpectedly large number of giant collisions, requiring
a special dynamical event at the end of solar system formation.

relation has previously been observed in several Galactic black hole X-ray

star X-ray binary. This result supports the hypothesis that a linear rms-flux
relation is common to all luminous black hole accretion and perhaps even a
fundamental property of accretion flows about compact objects. We also show for
the first time the cross-spectral properties of the variability of this ULX,
comparing variations below and above 1 keV. The coherence and time delays are
poorly constrained but consistent with high coherence between the two bands,
over most of the observable frequency range, and a significant time delay (with
hard leading soft variations). The magnitude and frequency dependence of the
lags are broadly consistent with those commonly observed in BHBs, but the
direction of the lag is reversed. These results indicate that ULX variability
studies, using long X-ray observations, hold great promise for constraining the
processes driving ULXs behaviour, and the position of ULXs in the scheme of
black hole accretion from BHBs to AGN.

existing calculations of the doubly differential cross section in the invariant
mass and scattering angle by using techniques from soft-collinear effective
theory to perform an NNLL resummation of threshold logarithms, which become
large when the invariant mass M of the top-quark pair approaches the partonic
center-of-mass energy. We also derive an approximate formula for the
differential cross section at NNLO in fixed-order perturbation theory, which
completely determines the coefficients multiplying the singular plus
distributions. We then match our results in the threshold region with the exact
results at NLO in fixed-order perturbation theory, and perform a numerical
analysis of the invariant mass distribution, the total cross section, and the
forward-backward asymmetry. We argue that these are the most accurate
predictions available for these observables at present. Using MSTW2008NNLO

gate dependence of the non-equilibrium cotunneling conductance. While on one
side of a Coulomb diamond the conductance decreases after the inelastic
cotunneling threshold towards its saturation value, on the other side it
increases monotonously even after the threshold. We show that this behavior
originates from an asymmetric gate voltage dependence of the effective
cotunneling amplitudes.

measurements of objects from the WMAP point source catalogue made using the VLA

independent of frequency with a median of ~2 per cent and an average, for
detected sources, of ~3.5 per cent. These values are also independent of the
total intensity over the narrow range of intensity we sample. Using a
contemporaneous sample of 105 sources detected at all 3 VLA frequencies, we
have investigated the spectral behaviour as a function of frequency by means of
a 2-colour diagram. Most sources have power-law spectra in total intensity, as
expected. On the other hand they appear to be almost randomly distributed in
the polarized intensity 2-colour diagram. This is compatible with the polarized
spectra being much less smooth than those in intensity and we speculate on the
physical origins of this. We have performed an analysis of the correlations
between the fractional polarization and spectral indices including computation
of the principal components. We find that there is little correlation between
the fractional polarization and the intensity spectral indices. This is also
the case when we include polarization measurements at 1.4 GHz from the NVSS. In
addition we compute 45 rotation measures from polarization position angles
which are compatible with a \lambda^2 law. We use our results to predict the
level of point source confusion noise that contaminates CMB polarization
measurements aimed at detecting primordial gravitational waves from inflation.
We conclude that some level of source subtraction will be necessary to detect
r~0.1 below 100 GHz and at all frequencies to detect r~0.01. We present
estimates of the level of contamination expected and the number of sources

temperatures so high that they imply a super-Eddington radiative flux at the
emitting surface, even during portions of bursts when there is no evidence of
photospheric radius expansion. This apparent inconsistency is usually set aside
by assuming that the flux is actually sub-Eddington and that the fitted
temperature is so high because the spectrum has been distorted by the
energy-dependent opacity of the atmosphere. Here we show that the spectra
predicted by currently available conventional atmosphere models appear
incompatible with the highest-precision measurements of burst spectra made
using the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer, such as during the 4U 1820-30 superburst
and a long burst from GX 17+2. In contrast, these measurements are well-fit by
Bose-Einstein spectra with high temperatures and modest chemical potentials.
Such spectra are very similar to Planck spectra. They imply surface radiative
fluxes more than a factor of three larger than the Eddington flux. We find that
segments of many other bursts from many sources are well-fit by similar
Bose-Einstein spectra, suggesting that the radiative flux at the emitting
surface also exceeds the Eddington flux during these segments. We suggest that
burst spectra can closely approximate Bose-Einstein spectra and have fluxes
that exceed the Eddington flux because they are formed by Comptonization in an
extended, low-density radiating gas supported by the outward radiation force
and confined by a tangled magnetic field.

modified from the inclusion of quantum effects, motivated from the loop quantum
gravity. In this note, by employing this modified entropy-area relation, we
derive corrections to Newton's law of gravitation as well as modified Friedman
equations by adopting the viewpoint that gravity can be emerged as an entropic
force. Our study further supports the universality of the log correction and
provides a strong consistency check on Verlinde's model.
