lines are originated by gas located close to the central super-massive black

called broad-line region. This region could be formed by clouds surrounding the
central black hole. In this work, we study the interaction of such clouds with
the base of the jets in active galactic nuclei, and we compute the produced
high-energy emission. We focus on sources with low luminosities in the inner
jet regions, to avoid strong gamma-ray absorption. We find that the resulting
high-energy radiation may be significant in Centaurus A. Also, this phenomenon
might be behind the variable gamma-ray emission detected in M87, if very large
dark clouds are present. The detection of jet-cloud interactions in active

spectral broadening of a narrowband astro-comb inside a highly nonlinear

side-mode amplitude asymmetry. These two detrimental effects can systematically
shift the center-of-gravity of astro-comb spectral lines as measured by an
astrophysical spectrograph with resolution \approx100,000; and thus lead to
wavelength calibration inaccuracy and instability. Our simulations indicate
that this performance penalty, as a result of nonlinear spectral broadening,
can be compensated by using a filtering cavity configured for double-pass. As
an explicit example, we present a design based on an Yb-fiber source comb (with
1 GHz repetition rate) that is filtered by double-passing through a low finesse
cavity (finesse = 208), and subsequent spectrally broadened in a 2-cm,
SF6-glass photonic crystal fiber. Spanning more than 300 nm with 16 GHz line

We present the POLLUX database of synthetic stellar spectra. For objects with
Teff < 6 000 K, MARCS atmosphere models are computed and the program
TURBOSPECTRUM provides the synthetic spectra. ATLAS12 models are computed for
stars with 7 000 K <Teff <15 000 K. SYNSPEC gives the corresponding spectra.
Finally, the code CMFGEN provides atmosphere models for the hottest stars (Teff
> 25 000 K). Their spectra are computed with CMF_FLUX. Both high resolution
(R>150 000) optical spectra in the range 3 000 to 12 000 A and spectral energy
distributions extending from the UV to near--IR ranges are presented. These
spectra cover the HR diagram at solar metallicity. We propose a wide variety of
synthetic spectra for various types of stars in a format that is compliant with
the Virtual Observatory standards. A user--friendly web interface allows an
easy selection of spectra and data retrieval. Upcoming developments will
include an extension to a large range of metallicities and to the near--IR high

significantly due to gravitational focusing. Two regimes can be distinguished.
Initially, the system experiences runaway growth, in which the gravitational
focusing factors increase, and bodies at the high-mass tail of the distribution
grow fastest. However, at some point the runaway body dynamically heats its
environment, gravitational focusing factors decrease, and runaway growth passes
into oligarchic growth. Based on the results of recent simulations, we
reconsider the runaway growth-oligarchy transition. In contrast to oligarchy,
we find that runaway growth cannot be approximated with a two component model
(of small and large bodies) and that the criterion of Ida & Makino (1993),
which is frequently adopted as the start of oligarchy, is not a sufficient
condition to signify the transition. Instead, we propose a new criterion based
on timescale arguments. We then find a larger value for the runaway
growth-oligarchy transition: from several hundreds of km in the inner disk
regions up to ~10^3 km for the outer disk. These findings are consistent with
the view that runaway growth has been responsible for the size distribution of
the present day Kuiper belt objects. Our finding furthermore outlines the
proper initial conditions at the start of the oligarchy stage.

we prove the accuracy of this new approach. Our methods provide the tools to
define a mission for a particular science goal, for example defined by the
expected number of discoveries and its confidence level. We detail how an
optimized star list can be built & how successive observations can be selected.
Our approach also provides other critical mission attributes, such as the
number of stars expected to be searched, & the probability of zero discoveries.
Because these attributes depend strongly on the mission scale, our methods are
directly applicable to the design of such future missions & provide guidance to
the mission & instrument design based on scientific performance. We illustrate
our new methods with practical calculations & exploratory design reference
missions for JWST operating with a distant starshade to reduce scattered and
diffracted starlight on the focal plane. We estimate that 5 habitable

the habitable zone around a nearby star. Mass is the most important parameter
of a planet and can only be measured by observing the motion of the star around
the planet-star center of mass. A single image of a planet, however, does not
provide evidence that the planet is Earth mass or that it is in a habitable
zone orbit. The planet's orbit, however, can be measured either by imaging the
planet at multiple epochs or by measuring the position of the star at multiple
epochs by space-based astrometry. The measurement of an exo-planet's orbit by
direct imaging is complicated by a number of factors: (1) the inner working
angle (IWA); (2) the apparent brightness of the planet depending on the orbital
phase; (3) confusion arising from the presence of multiple planets; and (4) the
planet-star contrast. In this paper we address the question: ""Can a prior
astrometric mission that can identify which stars have Earthlike planets
significantly improve the science yield of a mission to image exo-Earths?"" We
find that the Occulting Ozone Observatory (a small external occulter mission
that cannot measure spectra) could confirm the orbits of ~4 to ~5 times as many
exo-Earths if an astrometric mission preceded it to identify which stars had
such planets. We find that in the case of an internal coronagraph, a survey of
the nearest ~60 stars could be done with a telescope of half the size if an
astrometric mission had first identified the presence of Earth-like planets in
the habitable zone and measured their orbital parameters.

the other hand, there is no observational evidence that they accelerate
hadrons. The Fermi GST recently observed two bursts that exhibit a power-law
high-energy extension of the typical (Band) photon spectrum that extends to
$\sim 30$ GeV. On the basis of fireball phenomenology we argue that they, along
with GRB941017 observed by EGRET in 1994, show indirect evidence for
considerable baryon loading. Since the detection of neutrinos is the only
unambiguous way to establish that GRBs accelerate protons, we use two methods
to estimate the neutrino flux produced when they interact with fireball photons
to produce charged pions and neutrinos. While the number of events expected
from the Fermi bursts detected to date is small, we conclude that an event like
GRB941017 will be detected by the IceCube neutrino telescope if gamma-ray

speed c to go to zero as the square-root of the distance to the moving
boundary, and thus creates a degenerate and characteristic hyperbolic
free-boundary system wherein the density vanishes on the free-boundary, the
uniform Kreiss--Lopatinskii condition is violated, and manifest derivative loss
ensues. Nevertheless, we are able to establish the existence of unique
solutions to this system on a short time-interval, which are smooth (in Sobolev
spaces) all the way to the moving boundary, and our estimates have no
derivative loss with respect to initial data. Our proof is founded on an
approximation of the Euler equations by a degenerate parabolic regularization
obtained from a specific choice of a degenerate artificial viscosity term,
chosen to preserve as much of the geometric structure of the Euler equations as
possible. We first construct solutions to this degenerate parabolic
regularization using a new higher-order Hardy-type inequality; we then
establish estimates for solutions to this degenerate parabolic system which are
independent of the artificial viscosity parameter. Solutions to the
compressible Euler equations are found in the limit as the artificial viscosity
tends to zero. Our regular solutions can be viewed as degenerate viscosity
solutions. Out methodology can be applied to many other systems of degenerate
and characteristic hyperbolic systems of conservation laws.

apparently inflated by AGN outflow. I consider the evolution of the magnetic
field inside such a bubble, using a mixture of analytic and numerical methods.
It is found that the field relaxes into an equilibrium filling the entire
volume of the bubble. The timescale on which this happens depends critically on
the magnetisation and helicity of the outflow as well as on properties of the
surrounding ICM. If the outflow is strongly magnetised, the magnetic field
undergoes reconnection on a short timescale, magnetic energy being converted
into heat whilst the characteristic length scale of the field rises; this
process stops when a global equilibrium is reached. The strength of the
equilibrium field is determined by the magnetic helicity injected into the
bubble by the AGN: if the outflow has a consistent net flux and consequently a
large helicity then a global equilibrium will be reached on a short timescale,
whereas a low-helicity outflow results in no global equilibrium being reached
and at the time of observation reconnection will be ongoing. However, localised
flux-tube equilibria will form. If, on the other hand, the outflow is very
weakly magnetised, no reconnection occurs and the magnetic field inside the
bubble remains small-scale and passive. These results have implications for the
internal composition of the bubbles, their interaction with ICM -- in
particular to explain how bubbles could move a large distance through the ICM
without breaking up -- as well as for the cooling flow problem in general. In
addition, reconnection sites in a bubble could be a convenient source of
energetic particles, circumventing the problem of synchrotron emitters having a

background (CDIRB). By utilizing the observed stellar mass function and its
evolution as input to a semi-empirical model of galaxy formation, we isolate
the physics driving diffuse IR emission. The model includes contributions from
three primary sources of IR emission: steady-state star formation owing to
isolated disk galaxies, interaction-driven bursts of star formation owing to
close encounters and mergers, and obscured active galactic nuclei (AGN). We
find that most of the CDIRB is produced by equal contributions from objects at
z=0.5-1 and z>1, as suggested by recent observations. Of those sources, the
vast majority of the emission originates in systems with low to moderate IR
luminosities (L_{IR}<10^{12} $L_sun); the most luminous objects contribute
significant flux only at high-redshifts (z>2). All star formation in ongoing
mergers accounts for <10% of the total at all wavelengths and redshifts, while
emission directly attributable to the interaction-driven burst itself accounts
for <5%. We furthermore find that obscured AGN contribute <1-2% of the CDIRB at
all wavelengths and redshifts, with a strong upper limit of less than 4% of the
total emission. Finally, since electron-positron pair production interactions
with the CDIRB represent the primary source of opacity to very high energy
(VHE: E_\gamma > 1 TeV) \gamma-rays, the model provides predictions for the
optical depth of the Universe to the most energetic photons. We find that these
predictions agree with observations of high-energy cutoffs at TeV energies in
nearby blazars, and suggest that while the Universe is extremely optically
thick at >10 TeV, the next generation of VHE \gamma-ray telescopes can
reasonably expect detections from out to 50-150 Mpc.

redshifts, stellar masses, and stellar population properties, dividing the

levels a significant population of ""green-valley"" galaxies is observed. While

M_T sin(i) condition (i.e. give information about) not only the planet's true
mass M_T but also the value of sin(i) (where i is the orbital inclination
angle). Thus the value of sin(i) for a system with any particular observed
value of M_T sin(i) cannot be assumed to be drawn randomly from a uniform
distribution between zero and unity (corresponding to an isotropic i
distribution). The actual distribution from which it is drawn depends on the
intrinsic distribution of M_T for the exoplanet population being studied. We
give a simple Bayesian derivation of this relationship and apply it to several
""toy models"" for the (currently unknown) intrinsic distribution of M_T. The
results show that the effect can be an important one. For example, even for
simple power-law distributions of M_T, the median value of sin(i) in an
observed RV sample can vary between 0.25 and 0.71 (as compared to the 0.5 value
for an isotropic i distribution) for indices of the power-law in the quite
plausible range between -2 and -0.5, respectively. Over the same range of
indicies, the 95% confidence upper bound on M_T ranges from 4.5 to 400 times
larger than M_T sin(i), respectively, due to sin(i) uncertainty alone. More
complex, but still simple and plausible, distributions of M_T yield still more
complicated and less intuitive $sin(i)$ distributions. In particular, if the
M_T distribution contains any characteristic mass scale M_c, the sin(i)
distribution will depend on the ratio of M_T sin(i) to $M_c$, often in a
non-trivial way. Our qualitative conclusion is that RV studies of exoplanets,
both individual objects and statistical samples, should regard the sin(i)
factor as more than a ""numerical constant of order unity"" with simple and well
understood statistical properties. (abridged)

We analytically model the dark-matter power spectrum and its cross-power

including realistic substructure population within individual dark-matter
haloes and the scatter of the concentration parameter at fixed halo mass. We
consider three prescriptions for the mass-concentration relation and two for
the substructure distribution in dark-matter haloes. We show that this
extension of the halo model mainly increases the predicted power on the small
scales, and is crucial for proper modeling the cosmological weak-lensing signal

on vector-valued functions is considered, with an emphasis on characterizing
the suitability of the method for general application.We show that the standard
quadratic penalty is exactly analogous to the energy of a stretched string,
with the penalty parameter corresponding to its tension. This physical analogy
motivates a discussion of resolution independence, which we define as the
convergence of a computational function estimate to arbitrary accuracy with
increasing resolution.The multidimensional context makes direct application of
standard procedures for choosing the penalty parameter difficult, and a new
method is proposed and compared to the established generalized cross-validation
(GCV) and Akaike information criterion (AIC) functions.Our Bayesian method for
choosing this parameter is derived by introducing a scal e independence
criterion to ensure that simultaneously scaling the function samples and their
variances does not significantly change the posterior parameter distribution.
Due to the possibility of an exact polynomial fit, numerical issues prevent the
use of this prior, and a solution is presented based on adding a st ring
zero-point energy. This makes more complicated approaches recently propose d in
the literature unnecessary, and eliminates the requirement for sensitivity
analysis when the function deviates from the above mentioned polynomial. An
important class of problems which can be analyzed by this method are stochastic
numerical integrators, which are considered as an example problem. This work
represents the first extension of penalized spline methods to inference on
multidimensional numerical integrators reported in the literature. Several
numerical calculations illustrate the above points and address practical
application issues.

(iii) the recently proposed AGN feedback model of Booth & Schaye (2009).
Without AGN feedback (even in the quenching case), our simulated cluster
suffers from a strong overcooling problem, with a stellar mass fraction
significantly above observed values in M87. The baryon distribution is highly
concentrated, resulting in a strong adiabatic contraction (AC) of dark matter.
With AGN feedback, on the contrary, the stellar mass in the bright central
galaxy (BCG) lies below observational estimates and the overcooling problem
disappears. The stellar mass of the BCG is seen to increase with increasing
mass resolution, suggesting that our stellar masses converges to the correct
value from below. The gas and total mass distributions are in striking
agreement with observations. We also find a slight deficit (~10%) of baryons at
the virial radius, due to the effect of AGN-driven shock waves pushing gas to
Mpc scales and beyond. This baryon deficit results in a slight adiabatic
expansion of the dark matter distribution, that can be explained quantitatively

microscopy requires an understanding of their near-field response. As a first
step in this direction, we investigated the lateral resolution of a carbon
nanotube tip with respect to an ideal electric dipole representing an
elementary detected object. A Fredholm integral equation of the first kind was
formulated for the surface electric current density induced on a single-wall
carbon nanotube (SWNT) by the electromagnetic field due to an arbitrarily
oriented electric dipole located outside the SWNT. The response of the SWNT to
the near field of a source electric dipole can be classified into two types,
because surface-wave propagation occurs with (i) low damping at frequencies
less than ~ 200-250 THz and (ii) high damping at higher frequencies. The
interaction between the source electric dipole and the SWNT depends critically
on their relative location and relative orientation, and shows evidence of the
geometrical resonances of the SWNT in the low-frequency regime. These
resonances disappear when the relaxation time of the SWNT is sufficiently low.
The far-field radiation intensity is much higher when the source electric
dipole is placed near an edge of SWNT than at the centroid of the SWNT. The use
of an SWNT tip in scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy can
deliver a resolution less than ~ 20 nm. Moreover, our study shows that the
relative orientation and distance between the SWNT and the nanoscale dipole

environment in the SDSS, zCOSMOS and other surveys. The differential effects of
mass and environment are completely separable to z ~ 1, indicating that two
distinct processes are operating, ""mass-quenching"" and ""environment-quenching"".
Environment-quenching, at fixed over-density, evidently does not change with
epoch to z ~ 1, suggesting that it occurs as large-scale structure develops in
the Universe. The observed constancy of the mass-function shape for
star-forming galaxies, demands that the mass-quenching of galaxies around and
above M*, must be proportional to their star-formation rates at all z < 2. We
postulate that this simple mass-quenching law also holds over a much broader
range of stellar mass and epoch. These two simple quenching processes, plus
some additional quenching due to merging, then naturally produce (a) a
quasi-static Schechter mass function for star-forming galaxies with a value of
M* that is set by the proportionality between the star-formation and
mass-quenching rates, (b) a double Schechter function for passive galaxies with
two components: the dominant one is produced by mass-quenching and has exactly
the same M* as the star-forming galaxies but an alpha shallower by +1, while
the other is produced by environment effects and has the same M* and alpha as
the star-forming galaxies, and is larger in high density environments.
Subsequent merging of quenched galaxies modifies these predictions somewhat in
the denser environments, slightly increasing M* and making alpha more negative.
All of these detailed quantitative relationships between the Schechter
parameters are indeed seen in the SDSS, lending strong support to our simple
empirically-based model. The model naturally produces for passive galaxies the
""anti-hierarchical"" run of mean ages and alpha-element abundances with mass.

The complete data set gives a complex picture, in particular the measured

the variation of the nuclear luminosity. KI data alone indicate two scenarios:
the K-band emission is either dominated to ~90% by size scales smaller than

of theoretical models of circum-nuclear dust distributions. Or contrary, and
more likely, the K-band continuum emission is dominated by hot dust (>= 1300K)

of percent depending on the exact morphology observed. Our interferometric,
deprojected centro-nuclear dust radius estimate of 55+-5mpc is roughly
consistent with the earlier published expectations from circum-nuclear, dusty
radiative transfer models, and spectro-photometric modeling. However, our data
do not support the notion that the dust emission size scale follows the nuclear
variability of NGC 4151 as a R_dust \propto L_nuc^0.5 scaling relation. Instead
variable nuclear activity, lagging, and variable dust response to illumination
changes need to be combined to explain the observations.

SoHO/SUMER (EUV spectra), and Hinode/XRT (SXR). Characteristics such as low
emissivity and trajectories which slow as they reach the top of the arcade are
consistent with post-reconnection magnetic flux tubes retracting from a
reconnection site high in the corona until they reach a lower-energy magnetic
configuration. Viewed from a perpendicular angle, SADs should appear as
shrinking loops rather than downflowing voids. We present XRT observations of
supra-arcade downflowing loops (SADLs) following a coronal mass ejection (CME)

pairing-based systems, but a method is required to compute genus 2 curves such
that the Jacobian has a given number of points. Currently, all known methods
involve constructing genus 2 curves with complex multiplication via computing
their three Igusa class polynomials. These polynomials have rational
coefficients and require extensive computation and precision to compute. Both
the computation and the complexity analysis of these algorithms can be improved
by a more precise understanding of the denominators of the coefficients of the
polynomials. The main goal of this paper is to give a bound on the denominators
of Igusa class polynomials of genus 2 curves with CM by a primitive quartic CM
field. We give an overview of Igusa's results on the moduli space of genus two
curves and the method to construct genus 2 curves via their Igusa invariants.
We also give a complete characterization of the reduction type of a CM abelian
surface, for biquadratic, cyclic, and non-Galois quartic CM fields, and for any
type of prime decomposition of the prime, including ramified primes. The
methods of the proof of the main result involve studying the embedding problem
of the quartic CM field into certain matrix algebras over quaternions and
invoking techniques from crystalline deformation theory.

this paper is to study adaptive algorithms for time-varying channels, without
assuming any CSI at the transmitters or receivers. Specifically, we consider an
adaptive version of the recent Max-SINR algorithm for a time-division duplex
system. This algorithm uses a period of bi-directional training followed by a
block of data transmission. Training in the forward direction is sent using the
current beam-formers and used to adapt the receive filters. Training in the
reverse direction is sent using the current receive filters as beams and used
to adapt the transmit beamformers. The adaptation of both receive filters and
beamformers is done using a least-squares objective for the current block. In
order to improve the performance when the training data is limited, we also
consider using exponentially weighted data from previous blocks. Numerical
results are presented that compare the performance of the algorithms in

assumptions about the underlying output graph structure, such as assuming a

on the other hand, force one to trade off representational power with
computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose two new types of
probabilistic graphical models, large margin Boltzmann machines (LMBMs) and
large margin sigmoid belief networks (LMSBNs), for structured prediction.
LMSBNs in particular allow a very fast inference algorithm for arbitrary graph

probability is data-distribution dependent and is maximized in learning. The
new approach overcomes the representation-efficiency trade-off in previous

challenging problems in the theory of planetary system formation. In our
previous paper Kato et al. (2009), we have shown that a steady angular velocity
profile that consists of both super and sub-Keplerian regions is created in the
disk through non-uniform excitation of Magneto-Rotational Instability (MRI).
Such non-uniform MRI excitation is reasonably expected in a part of disks with
relatively low ionization degree. In this paper, we show through
three-dimensional resistive MHD simulations with test particles that this
radial structure of the angular velocity indeed leads to prevention of
spiral-in of dust particles and furthermore to their accumulation at the
boundary of super-Keplerian and sub-Keplerian regions. Treating dust particles
as test particles, their motions under the influence of the non-uniform MRI
through gas drag are simulated. In the most favorable cases (meter-size dust
particles in the disk region with a relatively large fraction of MRI-stable
region), we found that the dust concentration is peaked around the
super/sub-Keplerian flow boundary and the peak dust density is 10,000 times as
high as the initial value. The peak density is high enough for the subsequent
gravitational instability to set in, suggesting a possible route to
planetesimal formation via non-uniformly excited MRI in weakly ionized regions

source experiences recurrent flares on timescales of hours. The soft X-ray
variations, up to a factor of ~4, are much stronger than the hard X-ray
variations. With higher energy, the variability amplitude increases in the soft
X-rays but decreases in the hard X-rays. The hard X-ray variability amplitude,
however, is effectively large. For the first time, we detect a soft lag of
~1000s between the soft and hard X-ray variations. The soft lags might become
larger with larger energy differences. The overall X-ray spectra exhibit a
softer-when-brighter trend, whereas the soft X-ray spectra appear to show a
harder-when-brighter trend. The concave X-ray spectra of the source can be
interpreted as the sum of the high-energy tail of the synchrotron emission,
dominating in the soft X rays, and the low-energy end of the inverse Compton
(IC) emission, contributing more in the hard X-rays. The synchrotron spectra
are steep (\Gamma~2.6), while the IC spectra are flat (\Gamma~1.2). The
synchrotron spectra appear to harden with larger synchrotron fluxes, while the
IC spectra seem to soften with larger IC fluxes. When the source brightens, the
synchrotron fluxes increase but the IC fluxes decrease. The synchrotron tail
exhibits larger flux variations but smaller spectral changes than the IC
component does. The crossing energies between the two components and the trough
energies of spectral energy distributions (SEDs) increase when the source
brightens. The X-ray spectral variability demonstrates that the synchrotron and

core accretion models of Jupiter formation require a large core of > 10 Earth
mass to finish its formation by the time of disk dissipation. Reduction of
opacity in the accreting envelope is known to hasten gas giant formation.
Almost all the previous studies assumed grain-dominated opacity in the
envelope. Instead, we examine cases of grain-free envelopes in this study. Our
numerical simulations show that an isolated core of as small as 1.7 Earth mass
is able to capture disk gas to form a gas giant on a timescale of million
years, if the accreting envelope is grain-free; that value decreases to 0.75
Earth mass, if the envelope is metal-free, namely, composed purely of hydrogen
and helium. It is also shown that alkali atoms, which are known to be one of
the dominant opacity sources near 1500 K in the atmospheres of hot Jupiters,

replacing the custom scientific code run on user's computers. Despite its
benefits the VO technology has been still little exploited in stellar
spectroscopy. As an example of possible evolution in this field we present an
experimental web-based service for disentangling of spectra based on code
KOREL. This code developed by P. Hadrava enables Fourier disentangling and
line-strength photometry, i.e. simultaneous decomposition of spectra of
multiple stars and solving for orbital parameters, line-profile variability or
other physical parameters of observed objects. We discuss the benefits of the
service-oriented approach from the point of view of both developers and users
and give examples of possible user-friendly implementation of spectra

that can implement a wide range of mathematical theories using a common
higher-order metalanguage. Used as proof assistants, one of the advantages of
such powerful systems resides in their responsiveness to extensibility of their
reasoning capabilities, being designed over rule-based programming languages
that allow the user to build her own `programs to construct proofs' - the
so-called proof tactics.
  The present contribution discusses the implementation of an algorithm that
generates sound and complete tableau systems for a very inclusive class of
sufficiently expressive finite-valued propositional logics, and then
illustrates some of the challenges and difficulties related to the algorithmic
formation of automated theorem proving tactics for such logics. The procedure
on whose implementation we will report is based on a generalized notion of
analyticity of proof systems that is intended to guarantee termination of the
corresponding automated tactics on what concerns theoremhood in our targeted

properties of systems that can be modeled by a term rewriting system. This
representation and verification technique works well for proving properties of
infinite systems like cryptographic protocols or more recently on Java Bytecode
programs. This algorithm computes a tree automaton which represents a (regular)
over approximation of the set of reachable terms by rewriting initial terms.
This approach is limited by the lack of information about rewriting relation
between terms. Actually, terms in relation by rewriting are in the same
equivalence class: there are recognized by the same state in the tree
automaton.
  Our objective is to produce an automaton embedding an abstraction of the
rewriting relation sufficient to prove temporal properties of the term
rewriting system.
  We propose to extend the algorithm to produce an automaton having more
equivalence classes to distinguish a term or a subterm from its successors
w.r.t. rewriting. While ground transitions are used to recognize equivalence
classes of terms, epsilon-transitions represent the rewriting relation between
terms. From the completed automaton, it is possible to automatically build a
Kripke structure abstracting the rewriting sequence. States of the Kripke
structure are states of the tree automaton and the transition relation is given
by the set of epsilon-transitions. States of the Kripke structure are labelled
by the set of terms recognized using ground transitions. On this Kripke
structure, we define the Regular Linear Temporal Logic (R-LTL) for expressing
properties. Such properties can then be checked using standard model checking
algorithms. The only difference between LTL and R-LTL is that predicates are
replaced by regular sets of acceptable terms.

progress of our fundamental understanding of nature. This paper will
demonstrate that there exists in Newtonian theory in a spherical gravitational
field a formal symmetry between the kinetic (KE) and gravitational potential
energy (GPE) of a test mass. Put differently, there exists a way of expressing
GPE such that the form of the mathematical expression remains invariant under
an interchange of KE and GPE. When extended to relativity by a suitable
assumption, it leads to a framework that bridges the general relativistic and
Newtonian conceptions of gravitational energy, even though the symmetry is
broken except in the infinitesimal limit. Recognizing this symmetry at
infinitesimal scales makes it possible to write a relativistic equation of an
individual graviton, the properties of which under under one interpretation may
be unexpected.

beams of these pulsars have the nested core--cone structures. Based on the
phase location of the component peaks, we estimate the aberration--retardation
(A/R) phase shifts in the profiles. Due to the A/R phase shift, the peak of the
core component in the intensity profile and the inflection point of the
polarization angle swing are found to be symmetrically shifted in the opposite
directions with respect to the meridional plane in such a way that the core
shifts towards the leading side and the polarization angle inflection point
towards the trailing side. We have been able to locate the phase location of

suggested by McComas et al. (2009) for the origin of the heliospheric ENA
ribbon -- the most prominent feature seen in the all sky maps of heliospheric
ENAs discovered by the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX). The ribbon is a
region of enhanced fluxes of ENAs crossing almost the entire sky. Soon after
the ribbon's discovery it was realized (McComas et al., 2009) that the
enhancement of the fluxes could be in the directions where the radial component
of the interstellar magnetic field around the heliopause is close to zero
(Schwadron et al., 2009). Our model includes secondary charge exchange of the
interstellar H atoms with the interstellar pickup protons outside the
heliopause and is a further advancement of the kinetic-gasdynamic model by
Malama et al. (2006) where pickup protons were treated as a separate kinetic
component. Izmodenov et al. (2009) have shown in the frame of Malama's model
that the interstellar pickup protons outside the heliopause maybe a significant
source of ENAs at energies above 1 keV. The difference between the current work
and that of Izmodenov et al. (2009) is in the assumption of no-scattering for
newly created pickup protons outside the heliopause. In this limit the model
produces a feature qualitatively similar to the ribbon observed by IBEX.

the Jordan form of its model, linearized near the unstable equilibrium. The
limits on the voltage, fed to the motor, are taken into account explicitly. The
straight beam-and-ball system has one unstable mode in the motion near the
equilibrium point. The proposed control law ensures that the basin of

Therefore, this device, never considered in the past, is much more difficult to

propose a simple new control law, which ensures by adjusting its gain
parameters that the basin of attraction arbitrarily can approach the
controllability domain for the linear case. For both nonlinear systems,
simulation results are presented to illustrate the efficiency of the designed

merging and tidal interactions are expected to shape all large galaxies to the
present day. As a consequence, most seemingly normal disk galaxies should be
surrounded by spatially extended stellar 'tidal features' of low surface
brightness. As part of a pilot survey for such interaction signatures, we have
carried out ultra deep, wide field imaging of 8 isolated spiral galaxies in the
Local Volume, with data taken at small (D=0.1-0.5m) robotic telescopes that
provide exquisite surface brightness sensitivity (mu_V)~28.5$ mag/arcsec^2).
This initial observational effort has led to the discovery of six previously
undetected extensive (to ~30 kpc) stellar structures in the halos surrounding
these galaxies, likely debris from tidally disrupted satellites. In addition,
we confirm and clarify several enormous stellar over-densities previously
reported in the literature, but never before interpreted as tidal streams. Even
this pilot sample of galaxies exhibits strikingly diverse morphological
characteristics of these extended stellar features: great circle-like features
that resemble the Sagittarius stream surrounding the Milky Way, remote shells
and giant clouds of presumed tidal debris far beyond the main stelar body, as
well as jet-like features emerging from galactic disks. A qualitative
comparison with available simulations set in a Lambda-Cold Dark Matter
cosmology shows that the extraordinary variety of stellar morphologies detected
in this pilot survey matches that seen in those simulations. The common
existence of these tidal features around 'normal' disk galaxies and the
morphological match to the simulations constitutes new evidence that these
theoretical models also apply to a large number of other Milky Way-mass disk
galaxies in the Local Volume.

SEDs of 23 HLIRGs with spectroscopic redshifts and at least 5 photometric
bands. Most can be fitted with a combination of two simple templates: an AGN
dust torus and an M82-like starburst. In the optical, 17 of the objects are
fitted with QSO templates, 6 are fitted with galaxy templates. 20 of the 23
objects (87%) show evidence of an AGN either from the optical continuum or from
the signature of an AGN dust torus, but the starburst component is the dominant
contribution to bolometric luminosity in 14 out of 23 objects (61%). The
implied star-formation rates, even after correcting for lensing magnification,
are in excess of 1000 Mo /yr. We use infrared template-fitting models to
predict fluxes for all HLIRGs at submillimetre wavelengths, and show
predictions at 350 and 850 mu. Most would have 850 mu fluxes brighter than 5
mJy so should be easily detectable with current submillimetre telescopes. At
least 15% should be detectable in the Planck all-sky survey at 350 mu and all
Planck all-sky survey sources with z < 0.9 should be IIFSCz sources. From the
luminosity-volume test we find that HLIRGs show strong evolution. A simple
exponential luminosity evolution applied to all HLIRGs would be consistent with
the luminosity functions found in redshift bins 0.3-0.5, 0.5-1 and 1-2.

thought to be confined by a sharp truncation, sometimes speculated to coincide
with a star formation threshold. Over the past years, observational evidence
for both old and young stellar populations, as well as individual H II regions,
has demonstrated that the outer disk is an actively evolving part of a galaxy.
To provide constraints on the origin of the aforementioned H-alpha truncation
and the relation of H-alpha emission in the outer disk to the underlying
stellar population, we measure the shape of the outer H-alpha surface
brightness profile of 15 isolated, edge-on late-type disk galaxies using deep,
long-slit spectroscopy. Tracing H-alpha emission up to 50% beyond the optical
radius, R_25, we find a composite H-alpha surface brightness profile, well
described by a broken-exponential law, that drops more steeply in the outer
disk, but which is not truncated. The stellar continuum and H-alpha surface
brightness both exhibit a break at ~0.7 R_25, but the H-alpha emission drops
more steeply than the stellar continuum beyond that break. Although profiles
with truncations or single exponential laws correctly describe the H-alpha
surface brightness profiles of some individual galaxies, flexible
broken-exponentials are required in most cases and are therefore the more
appropriate generic description. The common existence of a significant second
surface brightness component beyond the H-alpha break radius disfavors the
hypothesis that this break is a purely stochastic effect.

substellar companions stand for both massive planets and brown dwarfs. We
conclude that sdB (EHB) stars are prime targets for planet searches. We reach
this conclusion by noticing that the bimodal distribution of planets around
stars with respect to the parameter M_p*a^2, is most prominent for stars in the
mass range 1Mo < M < 1.5Mo; 'a' is the orbital separation, 'M' is the stellar
mass and 'M_p' the planet mass. This is also the mass range of the progenitors
of EHB stars that are formed through the interaction of their progenitors with
planets (assuming the EHB formation mechanism is the binary model). In the
binary model for the formation of EHB stars interaction with a binary companion
or a substellar object (a planet or a brown dwarf), causes the progenitor to
lose most of its envelope mass during its red giant branch (RGB) phase. As a
result of that the descendant HB star is hot, i.e., an EHB (sdB) star. The
bimodal distribution suggests that even if the close-in planet that formed the
EHB star did not survive its RGB common envelope evolution, one planet or more
might survive at a>1AU. Also, if a planet or more are observed at a>1AU, it is
possible that a closer massive planet did survive the common envelope phase,

the number of covariates $p$ can be much larger than the sample size $n$. In
such a situation, one often assumes sparsity of the regression vector, \textit
i.e., the regression vector contains many zero components. We propose a
Lasso-type estimator $\hat{\beta}^{Quad}$ (where '$Quad$' stands for quadratic)
which is based on two penalty terms. The first one is the $\ell_1$ norm of the
regression coefficients used to exploit the sparsity of the regression as done
by the Lasso estimator, whereas the second is a quadratic penalty term
introduced to capture some additional information on the setting of the
problem. We detail two special cases: the Elastic-Net $\hat{\beta}^{EN}$, which
deals with sparse problems where correlations between variables may exist; and
the Smooth-Lasso $\hat{\beta}^{SL}$, which responds to sparse problems where
successive regression coefficients are known to vary slowly (in some
situations, this can also be interpreted in terms of correlations between
successive variables). From a theoretical point of view, we establish variable
selection consistency results and show that $\hat{\beta}^{Quad}$ achieves a
Sparsity Inequality, \textit i.e., a bound in terms of the number of non-zero
components of the 'true' regression vector. These results are provided under a
weaker assumption on the Gram matrix than the one used by the Lasso. In some
situations this guarantees a significant improvement over the Lasso.
Furthermore, a simulation study is conducted and shows that the S-Lasso
$\hat{\beta}^{SL}$ performs better than known methods as the Lasso, the
Elastic-Net $\hat{\beta}^{EN}$, and the Fused-Lasso with respect to the
estimation accuracy. This is especially the case when the regression vector is
'smooth', \textit i.e., when the variations between successive coefficients of
the unknown parameter of the regression are small. The study also reveals that
the theoretical calibration of the tuning parameters and the one based on 10
fold cross validation imply two S-Lasso solutions with close performance.

with the FM Co moment directed along the (001)$_{R}$ (=(111)$_{C}$) axis. By x

in low-mass cores, surrounded by a shallower gradient, as in the clumps around

peaks corresponding to antiferromagnetic order are observed below $T_N$
$\approx$ 2.5 K with a propagation vector of (0.5 0.5 0.5). On the other hand,
TbFe$_2$Zn$_{20}$ undergoes a ferromagnetic transition at temperatures as high
as 66 K which shows a high sensitivity to sample-to-sample variations. Two
samples of TbFe$_2$Zn$_{20}$ with the same nominal compositions but with
substantially different magnetic ordering temperatures ($T_c$ $\approx$ 51 and
66 K) were measured by single crystal neutron diffraction. Structural
refinements of the neutron diffraction data find no direct signature of atomic
site disorder between the two TbFe$_2$Zn$_{20}$ samples except for subtle
differences in the anisotropic thermal parameters. The differences in the
anisotropic thermal parameters between the two samples is likely due to very
small amounts of disorder. This provides further evidence for the extreme
sensitivity of the magnetic properties of TbFe$_2$Zn$_{20}$ to small sample
variations, even small amounts of disorder.

the interstellar medium (ISM). Hence, its abundance does not need to be
corrected for dust depletion when comparing the ISM to the stellar atmospheres.
The abundance of sulphur in the photosphere of metal-poor stars is a matter of
debate: according to some authors, [S/Fe] versus [Fe/H] forms a plateau at low
metallicity, while, according to other studies, there is a large scatter or
perhaps a bimodal distribution. In metal-poor stars sulphur is detectable by
its lines of Mult.1 at 920 nm, but this range is heavily contaminated by
telluric absorptions, and one line of the multiplet is blended by the hydrogen
Paschen zeta line. We study the possibility of using Mult. 3 (at 1045 nm) for
deriving the sulphur abundance because this range, now observable at the VLT
with the infra-red spectrograph CRIRES, is little contaminated by telluric
absorption and not affected by blends at least in metal-poor stars. We compare
the abundances derived from Multiplets 1 and 3, taking into account NLTE
corrections and 3D effects. Here we present the results for a sample of four
stars, although the scatter is less pronounced than in previous analysis, we
cannot find a plateau in [S/Fe], and confirm the scatter of the sulphur

We are particularly interested in the question how much information about an

how closely two algebras are related if they have equivalent generalized
cluster categories.
  Our approach makes use of the cluster-tilting objects in the generalized
cluster categories: We first observe that cluster-tilting objects in
generalized cluster categories are in natural bijection with cluster-tilting
subcategories of derived categories, and then prove a recognition theorem for
the latter.
  Using this recognition theorem we give a precise criterion when two cluster
equivalent algebras are derived equivalent. For a given algebra we further
describe all the derived equivalent algebras which have the same canonical
cluster tilting object in their generalized cluster category.
  Finally we show that in general, if two algebras are cluster equivalent, then
(under certain conditions) the algebras can be graded in such a way that the
categories of graded modules are derived equivalent. To this end we introduce
mutation of graded quivers with potential, and show that this notion reflects
mutation in derived categories.

states (n > 100) in hydrogen during the cosmological recombination epoch. For
this purpose, we developed a new ODE solver for the recombination problem,
based on an implicit Gear's method. This solver allows us to include up to 350
l-resolved shells or ~61 000 separate levels in the hydrogen model and to solve
the recombination problem for one cosmology in ~27 hours. This is a huge
improvement in performance over our previous recombination code, for which a
100-shell computation (5050 separate states) already required ~150 hours on a
single processor. We show that for 350 shells down to redshift z ~200 the
results for the free electron fraction have practically converged. The final
modification in the free electron fraction at z ~200 decreases from about
\DeltaNe/Ne ~2.8% for 100 shells to \DeltaNe/Ne ~1.6% for 350 shells. However,
the associated changes in the CMB power spectra at large multipoles l are
rather small, so that for accurate computations in connection with the analysis
of Planck data already ~100 shells are expected to be sufficient. Nevertheless,
the total value of \tau could still be affected at a significant level. We also
briefly investigate the effect of collisions on the recombination dynamics.
With our current estimates for the collisional rates we find a correction of
\DeltaNe/Ne ~ -0.088% at z ~ 700, which is mainly caused by l-changing
collisions with protons. Furthermore, we present results on the cosmological
recombination spectrum, showing that at low frequencies collisional processes
are important. However, the current accuracy of collisional rates is
insufficient for precise computations of templates for the recombination
spectrum at \nu<~1 GHz, and also the effect of collisions on the recombination
dynamics suffers from the uncertainty in these rates.

suggest that contact behavior is highly variable. The goal of this study is to
investigate the source and degree of this variability. We find that during
compression, the behavior of the contact force displacement curves is
reproducible, while during contact separation, the behavior is highly variable.
Examination of the contact surfaces suggest that two separation mechanism are
in operation and give rise to this variability. One mechanism corresponds to
the formation of a bridge between the two surfaces that plastically stretches
as the surfaces are drawn apart and eventually separates in shear. This leads
to a morphology after separation in which there are opposing asperities on the
two surfaces. This plastic separation/bridge formation mechanism leads to a
large work of separation. The other mechanism is a more brittle-like mode in
which a crack propagates across the base of the asperity (slightly below the
asperity/substrate junction) leading to most of the asperity on one surface or
the other after separation and a slight depression facing this asperity on the
opposing surface. This failure mode corresponds to a smaller work of
separation. those in which a single mechanism operates. Furthermore, contacts
made from materials that exhibit predominantly brittle-like behavior will tend
to require lower work of separation than those made from ductile-like contact
materials.

vector and axial-vector mesons. We calculate pion-pion scattering lengths and
the decay widths of scalar, vector, and axial-vector mesons. It is demonstrated
that vector and axial-vector meson degrees of freedom play an important role in
these low-energy processes and that a reasonable theoretical description
requires globally chirally invariant terms other than the vector meson mass
term. An important question for meson vacuum phenomenology is the quark content
of the physical scalar f0(600) and a0(980) mesons. We investigate this question
by assigning the quark-antiquark sigma and a0 states of our model with these
physical mesons. We show via a detailed comparison with experimental data that
this scenario can describe all vacuum properties studied here except for the
decay width of the sigma, which turns out to be too small. We also study the
alternative assignment f0(1370) and a0(1450) for the scalar mesons. In this
case the decay width agrees with the experimental value, but the pion-pion
scattering length $a_{0}^{0}$ is too small. This indicates the necessity to
extend our model by additional scalar degrees of freedom.

Hilbert modules over polynomial rings is given. The joint kernel for a large
class of submodules is described. The completion $[\mathcal I]$ of a
homogeneous (polynomial) ideal $\mathcal I$ in a Hilbert module is a submodule
for which the joint kernel is shown to be of the form $$
\{p_i(\tfrac{\partial}{\partial \bar{w}_1}, ..., \tfrac{\partial}{\partial
\bar{w}_m}) K_{[\mathcal I]}(\cdot,w)|_{w=0}, 1 \leq i \leq n\}, $$ where
$K_{[\mathcal I]}$ is the reproducing kernel for the submodule $[\mathcal I]$
and $p_1, ..., p_n$ is some minimal ""canonical set of generators"" for the ideal
$\mathcal I$. The proof includes an algorithm for constructing this canonical
set of generators, which is determined uniquely modulo linear relations, for
homogeneous ideals. A set of easily computable invariants for these submodules,
using the monoidal transformation, are provided. Several examples are given to
illustrate the explicit computation of these invariants.

flavour symmetry combined with SU(5) RGEs for scales above $M_{GUT}$, results
to an efficient suppression of the off-diagonal terms in the scalar soft
matrices, particularly for $m_0< 100$ GeV. Using the WMAP bounds, this implies
$35\le\tan\beta \le 45$, $350\,\mathrm{GeV}\le m_{1/2}\le 1\,\mathrm{TeV}$,
with the higher $\tan\beta$ values being favored. Within this framework, SU(5)
unification becomes compatible with the current experimental bounds, in
contrast to the conventional case where the soft terms are postulated at the
GUT scale.

phenomenological electrodynamics are scarce. In this paper we analyze the
possibility of making use of intensity-modulated whispering gallery modes in a
microresonator for this purpose. Systems of this kind appear attractive, as the
strong concentration of electromagnetic fields near the rim of the resonator
serves to enhance the Abraham torque exerted by the field. We analyze mainly
spherical resonators, although as an introductory step we consider also the
cylinder geometry. The order of magnitude of the Abraham torques are estimated
by inserting reasonable values for the various input parameters. As expected,
the predicted torques turn out to be very small, although probably not beyond
any reach experimentally. Our main idea is essentially a generalization of the
method used by G. B. Walker et al. [Can. J. Phys. 53, 2577] for low-frequency
fields, to the optical case.

calculated to be $5.33\,$\AA. The stability of ferromagnetic zb CrP/MnP
superlattice against antiferromagnetism is considered and it is found that the
ferromagnetic CrP/MnP superlattice is more stable than the antiferromagnetic
one. It is shown that at the equilibrium lattice constant the CrP/MnP
superlattice does not show any half metallicity mainly due to the minority
$t_{2g}$ states of Cr and Mn. However, if strain is imposed on the CrP/MnP
superlattice then the minority $t_{2g}$ electrons shift to higher energies and
the proposed superlattice becomes a half-metal ferromagnet. The effect of
tetragonal and orthorhombic distortions on the half metallicity of zb CrP/MnP
superlattice is also discussed. It is also shown that InP-CrP/MnP/InP is a true
half-metal ferromagnet. The half metallicity and magnetization of these
superlattices are robust against tetragonal/ orthorhombic deformation.

isomorphic to the lattice L(R) of all principal right ideals of some von
Neumann regular (not necessarily unital) ring R. We say that L has a large
4-frame if it has a homogeneous sequence (a_0,a_1,a_2,a_3) such that the
neutral ideal generated by a_0 is L. J\'onsson proved in 1962 that if L has a
countable cofinal sequence and a large 4-frame, then it is coordinatizable;
whether the cofinal sequence assumption could be dispensed with was left open.
We solve this problem by finding a non-coordinatizable sectionally complemented
modular lattice L with a large 4-frame; it has cardinality aleph one.
Furthermore, L is an ideal in a (necessarily coordinatizable) complemented
modular lattice with a spanning 5-frame. Our proof uses Banaschewski functions.
A Banaschewski function on a bounded lattice L is an antitone self-map of L
that picks a complement for each element of L. In an earlier paper, we proved
that every countable complemented modular lattice has a Banaschewski function.
We prove that there exists a unit-regular ring R of cardinality aleph one and
index of nilpotence 3 such that L(R) has no Banaschewski function.
