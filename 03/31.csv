(PMNS) is the parametrization with three mixing angles and one CP-violating
phase. There are two major options in this kind of parametrizations, one is the
original Kobayashi-Maskawa (KM) matrix, and the other is the Chau-Keung (CK)
matrix. In a new proposal by Frampton and He, a unitarity boomerang is
introduced to combine two unitarity triangles, and this new presentation
displays all four independent parameters of the KM parametrization in the quark
sector simultaneously. In this paper, we study the relations between KM and CK
parametrizations, and also consider the quark-lepton complementarity (QLC) in
the KM parametrization. The unitarity boomerang is discussed in the situation
of the CK parametrization for comparison with that in the KM parametrization in
the quark sector. Then we extend the idea of unitarity boomerang to the lepton
sector, and check the corresponding unitarity boomerangs in the two cases of
parametrizations.

spatial frequency, spatial locality and orientation to make compensate to the
variations of face instances occurred due to illumination, pose and facial

Gabor face representations with high dimensional feature vectors. PCA and
canonical covariate are then applied on the Gabor face representations to
reduce the high dimensional feature spaces into low dimensional Gabor

different facilities in infrared and visible wavelength ranges. In this paper
we propose to use such an instability for generation of VUV and X-ray
radiation. A typical longitudinal space charge amplifier (LSCA) consists of few
amplification cascades (drift space plus chicane) with a short undulator behind
the last cascade. If the amplifier starts up from the shot noise, the amplified
density modulation has a wide band, on the order of unity. The bandwidth of the
radiation within the central cone is given by inverse number of undulator
periods. A wavelength compression could be an attractive option for LSCA since
the process is broadband, and a high compression stability is not required.
LSCA can be used as a cheap addition to the existing or planned
short-wavelength FELs. In particular, it can produce the second color for a
pump-probe experiment. It is also possible to generate attosecond pulses in the
VUV and X-ray regimes. Some user experiments can profit from a relatively large
bandwidth of the radiation, and this is easy to obtain in LSCA scheme. Finally,
since the amplification mechanism is broadband and robust, LSCA can be an
interesting alternative to self-amplified spontaneous emission free electron
laser (SASE FEL) in the case of using laser-plasma accelerators as drivers of
light sources.

Due to the long-range dipole-dipole interaction one expects a rich structure of
bound complexes in this geometry. We study the bilayer case and determine the
two-body bound state properties as a function of the interaction strength. The
results clearly show that a least one bound state will always be present in the

use these data with ongoing, high angular resolution, interferometric
observations to model the density structure and sky orientation of the gas

near-infrared emission lines that form in Be star disks. We find that a
simplified measurement of the IR excess flux appears to be correlated with the
strength of emission lines from high level transitions of hydrogen. This
suggests that the near-IR continuum and upper level line fluxes both form in
the inner part of the disk, close to the star.

Background is not observationally excluded. The hypothesis of primordial
dichroism can be quantitatively falsified if the plasma is magnetized prior to
photon decoupling since the initial V-mode polarization affects the evolution
of the temperature fluctuations as well as the equations for the linear
polarization. The observed values of the temperature and polarization angular
power spectra are used to infer constraints on the amplitude and on the
spectral slope of the primordial V-mode. Prior to photon decoupling magnetic
fields play the role of polarimeters insofar as they unveil the circular
dichroism by coupling the V-mode power spectrum to the remaining brightness
perturbations. Conversely, for angular scales ranging between 4 deg and 10 deg
the joined bounds on the magnitude of circular polarization and on the magnetic
field intensity suggest that direct limits on the V-mode power spectrum in the
range of 0.01 mK could directly rule out pre-decoupling magnetic fields in the
range of 10-100 nG. The frequency dependence of the signal is located, for the
present purposes, in the GHz range.

the Serpens cloud core at eight epochs from December 2007 to December 2009. Two
sources are detected in our field, and are shown to form a tight binary system.
The primary (EC 95a) is a 4--5 $M_\odot$ proto-Herbig AeBe object (arguably the
youngest such object known), whereas the secondary (EC 95b) is most likely a
low-mass T Tauri star. Interestingly, both sources are non-thermal emitters.
While T Tauri stars are expected to power a corona because they are convective
while they go down the Hayashi track, intermediate-mass stars approach the main
sequence on radiative tracks. Thus, they are not expected to have strong
superficial magnetic fields, and should not be magnetically active. We review
several mechanisms that could produce the non-thermal emission of EC 95a, and
argue that the observed properties of EC 95a might be most readily interpreted
if it possessed a corona powered by a rotation-driven convective layer. Using
our observations, we show that the trigonometric parallax of EC 95 is $\pi$ =
2.41 $\pm$ 0.02 mas, corresponding to a distance of 414.9$^{+4.4}_{-4.3}$ pc.
We argue that this implies a distance to the Serpens core of 415 $\pm$ 5 pc,
and a mean distance to the Serpens cloud of 415 $\pm$ 25 pc. This value is
significantly larger than previous estimates ($d$ $\sim$ 260 pc) based on
measurements of the extinction suffered by stars in the direction of Serpens. A
possible explanation for this discrepancy is that these previous observations
picked out foreground dust clouds associated with the Aquila Rift system rather
than Serpens itself.

annihilation of weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) dark matter in the
sun. The event rate depends on the dark matter density in the sun, which in
turn is dictated by the cross section of WIMPs with nucleons. This however is
bounded by direct detection experiments. We use the constraints from these
experiments to place model-independent upper bounds on the event rates in
neutrino telescopes that apply to any elastic dark matter model. Since the
spin-independent WIMP-nucleon cross section is much more tightly constrained
than the corresponding spin-dependent cross section, the bounds are much
stronger in the former case and are competitive with the current limits from
IceCube. If the number of events observed in neutrino telescopes exceeds the
upper bound corresponding to spin-independent interactions, the implication is
that the cross section of dark matter with nucleons is dominated by
spin-dependent interactions. In such a scenario the natural dark matter
candidates are Majorana fermions and real vector bosons, so that dark matter
particles are their own anti-particles. We show that any such theory that leads
to observable event rates at current generation neutrino telescopes will in
general contain new particles charged under the Standard Model gauge groups

This combination offers the possibility of testing the validity of the DD

clusters via their shapes. We use WMAP (7 years) results by fixing the
conventional LCDM model to verify the consistence between the validity of DD

determine the probability density function (PDF) of \eta_{0}, we consider the
angular diameter distances from galaxy clusters recently studied by two
different groups by assuming elliptical (isothermal) and spherical
(non-isothermal) $\beta$ models. The strict validity of the DD relation will
occur only if the maximum value of \eta_{0} PDF is centered on \eta_{0}=0. It
was found that the elliptical $\beta$ model is in good agreement with the data,
showing no violation of the DD relation (PDF peaked close to \eta_0=0 at

investigate whether electrons can be accelerated to energies such that they
radiate synchrotron photons with energy up to about 10 GeV in this particular

1-GeV photons. We also find that the acceleration time for electrons radiating

somewhat longer for electrons radiating at a few GeV. This could explain the
lack of >100 MeV photons for the first few seconds after the trigger time for
long GRBs reported by the Fermi Satellite, and also the slight lag between
photons of GeV and 100 MeV energies. We model the onset of the external forward

starts with a delay relative to the prompt soft (sub-MeV) gamma-rays and lasts
long after the soft component fades. This has lead to the intriguing suggestion
that this high energy emission is generated via synchrotron emission of
relativistic electrons accelerated by the external shock. Moreover, the limits
on the MeV afterglow emission lead to the suggestion that, at least in bright
GeV bursts the field is not amplified beyond compression in the shock. We show
here that considerations of confinement (within the decelerating shock),
efficiency and cooling of the emitting electrons constrain, within this model,
the magnetic fields that arise in both the upstream (circum burst) and
downstream (ejecta) regions, allowing us to obtain a direct handle on their
values. The well known limit on the maximal synchrotron emission, when combined
with the blast wave evolution, implies that late photons (arriving more than
~100 s after the burst) with energies higher than ~ 10GeV do not arise
naturally from external shock synchrotron and almost certainly have a different
origin. Finally, even a modest seed flux (a few mJy) at IR-optical would
quench, via Inverse Compton cooling, the GeV emission unless the magnetic field
is significantly amplified behind the shock. An observation of a burst with
simultaneous IR-optical and GeV emission will rule out this model.

N-body models that take into account the effect of primordial gas expulsion. We
divide the stars into two populations which mimic the chemical and dynamical

with a more centrally concentrated distribution. The main effect of gas
expulsion is to eject preferentially first generation stars while second
generation stars remain bound to the cluster. In the most favourable cases
second generation stars can account for 60% of the bound stars we see today. We
also find that at the end of the gas expulsion phase, the radial distribution
of the two populations is still different, so that long-term evolution will
further increase the fraction of second generation stars. The large fraction of

the optomechanical interaction, but also gives rise to qualitatively new
coupled dynamics. As early as 1967, in a pioneering work, V. Braginsky analyzed
theoretically the role of radiation pressure in the interferometric measurement
process, but it has remained experimentally unexplored for many decades. Here,
we use whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) optical microresonators to study these
radiation pressure phenomena. Optical microresonators simultaneously host
optical and mechanical modes, which are systematically analyzed and optimized
to feature ultra-low mechanical dissipation, photon storage times exceeding the
mechanical oscillation period (i.e. the ""resolved-sideband regime"") and large
optomechanical coupling. It is demonstrated that dynamical backaction can be
employed to cool mechanical modes, i.e., to reduce their thermally excited
random motion. Utilizing this novel technique together with cryogenic
pre-cooling of the mechanical oscillator, the phonon occupation of mechanical
radial-breathing modes could be reduced to about 60 excitation quanta. The
corresponding displacement fluctuations are monitored interferometrically with
a sensitivity at the level of 10^-18 m/Hz^(1/2), which is below the imprecision
at the standard quantum limit (SQL). It is shown that optical measurement
techniques employed here are operating in a near-ideal manner according to the
principles of quantum measurement, displaying a backaction-imprecision product
close to the quantum limit. An outlook on optomechanical experiments with
crystalline WGM resonators and the effect of ""optomechanically induced

estimated based on a statistical analysis of trajectories of test bodies in the

than the primary group are noticeably evolved, which resolves a disagreement
between distance moduli derived from the tip of the RGB and from stars near the
instability strip. The sharp cut at the red end of the HB provides strong
evidence that stars from the dominant HB group must still be undergoing blue
loops, implying that diffusion is being inhibited. We argue that M13's HB is a
somewhat pathological case - the dominant HB population occurs very near the
""knee"" in optical CMDs, and evolved stars exclusively appear redward of that
peak, leading to the incorrect appearance of a continuation of the unevolved
HB.
  M13 has a distinct group of HB stars previously identified with the second U
jump, which may be examples of early hot flashers that ignite core helium
fusion shortly after leaving the RGB. However, there is not convincing evidence
that a large fraction of stars leave the RGB before helium flash. We revisited
the helium-sensitive R ratio, and find that M13's ratio is in agreement with
theoretical values for primordial helium abundance Y_P = 0.245 and inconsistent
with a helium enhancement DY = 0.04. The brightness of the HB (both in
comparison to the end of the canonical HB and to the tip of the RGB) also
appears to rule out the idea that the envelopes of the reddest HB stars have
been significantly enriched in helium. The absolute colors of the turnoffs of

most reliable classification method for unknown sequences. However, traditional
likelihood-based phylogenetic methods cannot be applied to large volumes of
short reads from next-generation sequencing due to computational complexity
issues and lack of phylogenetic signal. ""Phylogenetic placement,"" where a
reference tree is fixed and the unknown query sequences are placed onto the
tree via a reference alignment, is a way to bring the inferential power of
likelihood-based approaches to large data sets. This paper introduces pplacer,
a software package for phylogenetic placement and subsequent visualization. The
algorithm can place twenty thousand short reads on a reference tree of one
thousand taxa per hour per processor, has essentially linear time and memory
complexity in the number of reference taxa, and is easy to run in parallel.
Pplacer features calculation of the posterior probability of a placement on an
edge, which is a statistically rigorous way of quantifying uncertainty on an
edge-by-edge basis. It also can inform the user of the positional uncertainty
for query sequences by calculating expected distance between placement
locations, which is crucial in the estimation of uncertainty with a
well-sampled reference tree. The software provides visualizations using branch
thickness and color to represent number of placements and their uncertainty. A
simulation study using reads generated from 631 COG alignments shows a high
level of accuracy for phylogenetic placement over a wide range of alignment
diversity, and the power of edge uncertainty estimates to measure placement
confidence. Pplacer enables efficient phylogenetic placement and subsequent
visualization, making likelihood-based phylogenetics methodology practical for
large collections of reads; it is available as source code, binaries, and a web
service.

globular sets. For the latter, n-skeletal implies (n+1)-coskeletal but for the
other two examples the situation is considerably more complicated: n-skeletal

move through a plasma containing large-scale magnetic fluctuations. We
numerically integrate the trajectories of a large number of electrons, which
are treated as test particles moving in the time dependent electric and
magnetic fields determined from 2-D hybrid simulations (kinetic ions, fluid
electron). The large-scale magnetic fluctuations effect the electrons in a
number of ways and lead to efficient and rapid energization at the shock front.
Since the electrons mainly follow along magnetic lines of force, the
large-scale braiding of field lines in space allows the fast-moving electrons
to cross the shock front several times, leading to efficient acceleration.
Ripples in the shock front occuring at various scales will also contribute to
the acceleration by mirroring the electrons. Our calculation shows that this
process favors electron acceleration at perpendicular shocks. The current study
is also helpful in understanding the injection problem for electron
acceleration by collisionless shocks. It is also shown that the spatial
distribution of energetic electrons is similar to in-situ observations (e.g.,
Bale et al. 1999; Simnett et al. 2005). The process may be important to our
understanding of energetic electrons in planetary bow shocks and interplanetary
shocks, and explaining herringbone structures seen in some type II solar radio

the fluctuations in most models, turns out to be too large, because it is
inversely proportional to the slow roll parameter, which is expected to be very
small. This fact requires the fine tuning of the inflaton potential. In series
of recent works it has been argued that the success of the inflationary picture
is not fully justified in terms of the rules of quantum theory as applied to
the cosmological setting and that an extra element, something akin to a self
induced collapse of the wave function is required. There, it was suggested that
the incorporation of such collapse in the treatment might avoid the need for
fine tuning of the potential that afflicts most inflationary models. In this

breaks into multiple plasmoids and even thinner current sheets through multiple
levels of cascading if the Lundquist number is greater than a critical value
$S_{c}\simeq4\times10^{4}$. As a result of the plasmoid instability, the system
realizes a fast nonlinear reconnection rate that is nearly independent of $S$,
and is only weakly dependent on the level of noise. The number of plasmoids in
the linear regime is found to scales as $S^{3/8}$, as predicted by an earlier
asymptotic analysis (Loureiro \emph{et al.}, Phys. Plasmas \textbf{14}, 100703

scaling, and is proportional to $S$. The thickness and length of current sheets
are found to scale as $S^{-1}$, and the local current densities of current
sheets scale as $S^{-1}$. Heuristic arguments are given in support of theses

that space-time has a temperature for accelerating observers and horizons is
direct evidence that there are underlying microscopic degrees of freedom. The
equipartition of energy, meaning of temperature, in these modes leads one to
anticipate that there is also an entropy associated. When this entropy is
maximized on a volume of space-time, then one retrieves the metric of

the extremum in entropy on the volume, then the volume integral of the entropy
can readily be converted to surface integral, via Gauss's Theorem. This surface

on ideal and non-ideal contacts. A three dimensional Poisson equation is solved
self-consistently to obtain the potential profile in the absence of an external
magnetic field considering a Hall bar defined both by gates (contacts) and
etching (lateral confinement). In the presence of a perpendicular magnetic
field, we obtain the spatial distribution of the incompressible strips, taking
into account the electron-electron interactions within the Thomas-Fermi

conductivity model, we also calculate the current distribution. We observe that
the incompressible strips can reside either on the edge or at the bulk
depending on the field strength. Our numerical results show that, due to a
density poor region just in front of the contacts, the incompressible strips do
not penetrate to the injection region when considering non-ideal contact
configuration. Such a non-ideal contact is in strong contrast with the
conventional edge channel pictures, hence has a strong influence on transport.
We also take into account heating effects in a phenomenological manner and
propose a current injection mechanism from the compressible regions to the
incompressible regions. The model presented here perfectly agrees with the
local probe experiments all together with the formation of hot-spots.

a popular transition between tree topologies known as subtree
pruning-and-regrafting (SPR). We analyze the Markov chain in the simpler
setting that the generating tree consists of very short edge lengths, short
enough so that each sample from the generating tree (or character in
phylogenetic terminology) is likely to have only one mutation, and that there
enough samples so that the data looks like the generating distribution. We
prove in this setting that the Markov chain is rapidly mixing, i.e., it quickly
converges to its stationary distribution, which is the posterior distribution
over tree topologies. Our proofs use that the leading term of the maximum
likelihood function of a tree T is the maximum parsimony score, which is the
size of the minimum cut in T needed to realize single edge cuts of the
generating tree. Our main contribution is a combinatorial proof that in our
simplified setting, SPR moves are guaranteed to converge quickly to the maximum
parsimony tree. Our results are in contrast to recent works showing examples
with heterogeneous data (namely, the data is generated from a mixture
distribution) where many natural Markov chains are exponentially slow to
converge to the stationary distribution.

  Information Theory",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Linear receivers are often used to reduce the implementation complexity of
multiple-antenna systems. In a traditional linear receiver architecture, the
receive antennas are used to separate out the codewords sent by each transmit
antenna, which can then be decoded individually. Although easy to implement,
this approach can be highly suboptimal when the channel matrix is near
singular. This paper develops a new linear receiver architecture that uses the
receive antennas to create an effective channel matrix with integer-valued
entries. Rather than attempting to recover transmitted codewords directly, the
decoder recovers integer combinations of the codewords according to the entries
of the effective channel matrix. The codewords are all generated using the same
linear code which guarantees that these integer combinations are themselves
codewords. Provided that the effective channel is full rank, these integer
combinations can then be digitally solved for the original codewords. This
paper focuses on the special case where there is no coding across transmit
antennas and no channel state information at the transmitter(s), which
corresponds either to a multi-user uplink scenario or to single-user V-BLAST
encoding. In this setting, the proposed integer-forcing linear receiver
significantly outperforms conventional linear architectures such as the
zero-forcing and linear MMSE receiver. In the high SNR regime, the proposed
receiver attains the optimal diversity-multiplexing tradeoff for the standard
MIMO channel with no coding across transmit antennas. It is further shown that
in an extended MIMO model with interference, the integer-forcing linear
receiver achieves the optimal generalized degrees-of-freedom.

$T_X$. There the dynamic response of the solid satisfies $\omega \tau(T_X) \sim

predict that the maximum change of the amplitude of the shear modulus and the
height of the dissipation peak are independent of the applied frequency
$\omega$. Our calculations also show a qualitative difference in behavior of
the shear modulus depending on the temperature behavior of the glass relaxation
time $\tau(T)$. These predictions can be tested by comparing the complex shear
modulus with experiments at different frequencies and for different levels of

Alphen magnetization and magnetic susceptibility through the dimensionless
parameter $(\beta =\frac{E}{\upsilon_{F}B})$. As the parameter $\beta$
increases, the values of magnetization and magnetic susceptibility increase to
positive infinity or decrease to negative infinity at the exotic point
$\beta_{c}=1$. Besides, the $dHvA$ oscillation amplitude rises abruptly to
infinity for zero temperature at $\beta_{c}=1$, but eventually collapses at a
finite temperature thereby leading to the vanishing of de Haas-van Alphen
effect. In addition, the magnetic susceptibility depends on the electric and
magnetic fields, suggesting that the graphene should be a non-linear magnetic
medium in the presence of the external field. These results, which are
different from those obtained in the standard nonrelativistic 2D electron gas,
are attributed to its anomalous Landau level spectrum in graphene.

that can affect the excision potential of some interference mitigation
algorithms. The techniques considered are those that modify signals from
auxiliary reference antennas to model and cancel interference from an
astronomical observation. These techniques can be applied in the time domain,
where the RFI voltage is modeled and subtracted from the astronomy signal path
(adaptive noise canceling), or they can be applied to the autocorrelated and
cross-correlated voltage spectra in the frequency domain (postcorrelation
canceling). For ideal receivers and a single, statistically stationary
interfering signal, both precorrelation and postcorrelation filters can result
in complete cancellation of the interference from the observation. The
postcorrelation method has the advantage of being applied on tens or hundreds
of millisecond timescales rather than tens or hundreds of nanosecond
timescales. However, this can be a disadvantage if the RFI transmitter location
is changing, since the cross-correlated power measurements which link the
interference power in the astronomy and reference signal paths can decorrelate.
If the decorrelation is not too severe, it can be allowed for, at the expense
of a noise increase. The time domain adaptive cancelers are allowed to slightly
vary their internal coefficients and adapt to changing phases during the
integrations, which means that they avoid the decorrelation problem. However,
the freedom to adapt also results in a noise increase. In this paper the
ability of both types of cancelers to excise interference originating from a
moving source is compared. The cancelers perform well on both observed and
simulated data, giving complete cancellation.

emulsion film detectors, a technique in which images are obtained by measuring
the position and the residual range of protons passing through the patient's
body. For this purpose, nuclear emulsion films interleaved with tissue
equivalent absorbers can be used to reconstruct proton tracks with very high
accuracy. This is performed through a fully automated scanning procedure
employing optical microscopy, routinely used in neutrino physics experiments.
Proton radiography can be used in proton therapy to obtain direct information
on the average tissue density for treatment planning optimization and to
perform imaging with very low dose to the patient. The first prototype of a
nuclear emulsion based detector has been conceived, constructed and tested with
a therapeutic proton beam. The first promising experimental results have been
obtained by imaging simple phantoms.

$\Omega $ is an arbitrary connected open cone in ${\mathbb R}^d$, then any two
positive harmonic functions in $\Omega $ that vanish on $\partial \Omega $ must
be proportional -an already known fact when $\Omega $ has a Lipschitz basis or
more generally a John basis. It is also shown however that when $d \geq 4$,
there can be more than one Martin point at infinity for the cone though
non-tangential convergence to the canonical Martin point at infinity always
holds. In contrast, when $d \leq 3$, the Martin point at infinity is unique for
every cone. These properties connected with the dimension are related to
well-known results of M. Cranston and T. R. McConnell about the lifetime of
conditioned Brownian motions in planar domains and also to subsequent results
by R. Ba\~nuelos and B. Davis. We also investigate the nature of the Martin
points arising at infinity as well as the effects on the Martin boundary
resulting from the existence of John cuts in the basis of the cone or from
other regularity assumptions. The main results together with their proofs
extend to cylinders ${\mathcal C}_Y(\Sigma)= {\mathbb R} \times \Sigma$ -where
$\Sigma $ is a relatively compact region of a manifold $M$-, equipped with a
suitable second order elliptic operator.

The enhanced binary tree (EBT) can be viewed as a prototype model displaying
two separate percolation thresholds. We present an analytic result for the EBT
model which gives two critical percolation threshold probabilities,
$p_{c1}=1/2\sqrt{13}-3/2$ and $p_{c2}=1/2$, and yields a size-scaling exponent
$\Phi =\ln [\frac{p(1+p)}{1-p(1-p)}]/\ln 2$. It is inferred that the two

exact. In addition, we argue that $p_{c2}$ is also exact. The physics of the
model and the results are described within the midpoint-percolation concept:
Monte Carlo simulations are presented for the number of boundary points which
are reached from the midpoint, and the results are compared to the number of

range extends from the caging regime characteristic of glass-formers to the
relaxation of the chain Rouse modes. We review our recent work on this
question, provide new results and critically discuss the limitations of the
theory. Solutions of the MCT for the structural relaxation reproduce
qualitative trends of simulations for weak and moderate barriers. However a
progressive discrepancy is revealed as the limit of stiff chains is approached.
This disagreement does not seem related with dynamic heterogeneities, which
indeed are not enhanced by increasing barrier strength. It is not connected
either with the breakdown of the convolution approximation for three-point
static correlations, which retains its validity for stiff chains. These
findings suggest the need of an improvement of the MCT equations for polymer
melts. Concerning the relaxation of the chain degrees of freedom, MCT provides
a microscopic basis for time scales from chain reorientation down to the caging
regime. It rationalizes, from first principles, the observed devations from the
Rouse model on increasing the barrier strength. These include anomalous scaling
of relaxation times, long-time plateaux, and non-monotonous wavelength
dependence of the mode correlators.

adding on a spacelike flat dimension to the BTZ black hole metric of

respect to the L-Z and M-Z relations of other gas-rich, star-forming dwarf
galaxies, viz., blue compact galaxies (BCGs) and dwarf irregular (dI) galaxies.
We find that while the metallicities of some low-luminousity XMD galaxies are
consistent with those expected from the L-Z relation, other XMD galaxies are
deviant. We determine the 95 per cent confidence interval around the L-Z
relation for BCGs, and find that its lower boundary is given by 12 + log(O/H) =
-0.177 M_{B} + 4.87. We suggest that a galaxy should be regarded as XMD, in a
statistically significant manner, only if it lies below this boundary in the
L-Z plane. Of our sample of XMD galaxies, we find that more than half are XMD
by this criterion. We also determine the gas mass fractions and chemical yields
of galaxies in all three samples. We find that the effective chemical yield
increases with increasing baryonic mass, consistent with what is expected if
outflows of metal-enriched gas are important in determining the effective
yield. XMD galaxies have lower effective yield than BCG/dI galaxies of similar
baryonic mass. Motivated by the fact that interactions are common in XMD
galaxies, we suggest that improved (tidally-driven) mixing of the interstellar
media (ISM) in XMD galaxies leads to a lowering of both, the measured
metallicity and the calculated effective yield. We suggest that XMD galaxies
are deviant from the L-Z relation because of a combination of being gas-rich
(i.e., having processed less gas into stars) and having more uniform mixing of
metals in their ISM.

installed at the 3.6-m Canada-France-Hawaii telescope and the 2-m Telescope
Bernard Lyot at Pic du Midi, during two monitoring campaigns (June 2007 and
July 2008).
  HD 189733 has a mainly toroidal surface magnetic field, having a strength
that reaches up to 40 G. The star is differentially rotating, with latitudinal
angular velocity shear of domega = 0.146 +- 0.049 rad/d, corresponding to
equatorial and polar periods of 11.94 +- 0.16 d and 16.53 +- 2.43 d
respectively. The study of the stellar activity shows that it is modulated
mainly by the stellar rotation (rather than by the orbital period or the beat
period between the stellar rotation and the orbital periods). We report no
clear evidence of magnetospheric interactions between the star and the planet.
  We also extrapolated the field in the stellar corona and calculated the
planetary radio emission expected for HD 189733b given the reconstructed field
topology. The radio flux we predict in the framework of this model is time
variable and potentially detectable with LOFAR.

is realized from Dynamic Threshold MOSFET(DTMOS), suitable for sub-threshold
digital circuit operation. Basically the principle of sub- threshold logics is
operating MOSFET in sub-threshold region and using the leakage current in that
region for switching action, there by drastically decreasing power. To reduce
the power consumption of sub-threshold circuits further, a novel body biasing
technique termed VTMOS is introduced .VTMOS approach is realized from DTMOS
approach. Dynamic threshold MOS (DTMOS) circuits provide low leakage and high
current drive, compared to CMOS circuits, operated at lower voltages. The VTMOS
is based on operating the MOS devices with an appropriate substrate bias which
varies with gate voltage, by connecting a positive bias voltage between gate
and substrate for NMOS and negative bias voltage between gate and substrate for
PMOS. With VTMOS, there is a considerable reduction in operating current and
power dissipation, while the remaining characteristics are almost the same as
those of DTMOS. Results of our investigations show that VTMOS circuits improves
the power up to 50% when compared to CMOS and DTMOS circuits, in sub- threshold
region.. The performance analysis and comparison of VTMOS, DTMOS and CMOS is
made and test results of Power dissipation, Propagation delay and Power delay
product are presented to justify the superiority of VTMOS logic over
conventional sub-threshold logics using Hspice Tool. The dependency of these
parameters on frequency of operation has also been investigated.

the contact surface of two merging neutron stars. That region has been
identified as the site of efficient amplification of magnetic fields. However,
these global simulations, due to numerical limitations, were unable to
determine the saturation level of the field strength, and thus the possible
back-reaction of the magnetic field onto the flow. Aims. We investigate the
amplification of initially weak fields in KH unstable shear flows, and the
back-reaction of the field onto the flow. Methods. We use a high-resolution
ideal MHD code to perform 2D and 3D local simulations of shear flows. Results.
In 2D, the magnetic field is amplified in less than 0.01ms until it reaches
locally equipartition with the kinetic energy. Subsequently, it saturates due
to resistive instabilities that disrupt the KH vortex and decelerate the shear
flow on a secular time scale. We determine scaling laws of the field
amplification with the initial field strength and the grid resolution. In 3D,
this hydromagnetic mechanism may be dominated by purely hydrodynamic
instabilities limiting the amplification. We find maximum magnetic fields of
10^16 G locally, and r.m.s. maxima within the box of 10^15 G. However, such
strong fields exist only for a short period. In the saturated state, the
magnetic field is mainly oriented parallel to the shear flow for strong initial
fields, while weaker initial fields tend to lead to a more balanced
distribution of the field energy. In all models the flow shows small-scale
features. The magnetic field is at most in equipartition with the decaying
shear flow. (abridged)

The reduction in the galactic cosmic ray influx caused by the young Sun's
enhanced shielding capability has been suggested as a solution to what is known
as the faint young Sun paradox, i.e. the fact that the luminosity of the young
Sun was only around 75% of its present value when life started to evolve on our

that the changing solar activity results in a changing influx of galactic
cosmic rays to the Earth, which results in a changing low-altitude cloud

ejection rates of the young Sun would have had an effect on the climate with a

influence of the Lagrange multiplier field on these models. We show that the
energy density evolution of the Einstein-aether field and the quintessence

nearly a constant during the entire history of the Universe. The energy density
of the quintessence field can also be kept nearly constant in the matter

This suggests a possible dynamical origin of the cosmological constant or dark

gravitational aether owing to quantum gravity effects, which may be identified
with this invisible tension, can solve this coincidence problem. The fact that
the expansion of the universe is starting to accelerate at the epoch when we

simulations and numerical radiative transfer calculations. These involved
various structural models for the ambient media, with density profiles
appropriate for galactic and extragalactic systems. The radiative transfer
formulation took full account of emission, absorption, re-emission, Faraday
rotation and Faraday conversion explicitly. High time-resolution intensity maps
were generated, frame-by-frame, to track the spatial hydrodynamical and
radiative properties of the evolving jets. Intensity light curves were computed
via integrating spatially over the emission maps. We apply the models to jets
in active galactic nuclei (AGN). From the jet simulations and the
time-dependent emission calculations we derived empirical relations for the
emission intensity and size for jets at various evolutionary stages. The
temporal properties of jet emission are not solely consequences of intrinsic
variations in the hydrodynamics and thermal properties of the jet. They also
depend on the interaction between the jet and the ambient medium. The
interpretation of radio jet morphology therefore needs to take account of
environmental factors. Our calculations have also shown that the environmental
interactions can affect specific emitting features, such as internal shocks and
hotspots. Quantification of the temporal evolution and spatial distribution of
these bright features, together with the derived relations between jet size and
emission, would enable us to set constraints on the hydrodynamics of AGN and
the structure of the ambient medium.

the bowtie lattice. Two types of striped diagonal long-range order (striped
order I and striped order II) are discussed. A state with type-II striped order
and superfluidity is found, even without nearest-neighbor repulsion. The
emergence of such a state is due to the inhomogeneity and the anisotropy of the
lattice structure. However, neither the translational symmetry nor the symmetry
between sublattices of the original lattice is broken. In this paper, we
restrict a 'solid state' of lattice bosons as a diagonal long-range ordered
state breaking either the translational symmetry of the original lattice or the
symmetry of different sublattices. We thus name such a phase a striped
superfluid phase (SSF). In the presence of a nearest-neighbor repulsion, we
find two striped charge density wave phases(SCDW I and II) with boson density
$\rho=1/2$ (with striped order I) and $\rho=2/3$ (with striped order II)
respectively, when the hopping amplitude is small compared with the repulsion.
The SCDW I state is a solid, in which the translational symmetry of the
original lattice is broken. We observe a rather special first-order phase
transition showing an interesting multi-loop hysteresis phenomenon between the
two SCDW phases when the hopping term is small enough. This can be accounted
for by the special degeneracy of the ground states near the classical limit.
The SSF re-appears outside the two SCDW phases. The transition between the SCDW
I and SSF phases is first order, while the transition between SCDW II and SSF
phases is continuous. We find that the superfluid stiffness is anisotropic in
the SSF states with and without repulsion. In the SSF with repulsion, the
superfluid stiffness is subject to different types of anisotropy in the region
near half filling and above 2/3-filling.

epochs of star formation in the Galaxy and because they present both special
opportunities and problems. The ages of open clusters are important for
understanding the limitations of stellar models and for calibrating empirical
age indicators. For individual stars, a hierarchy of quality for the available
age-dating methods is described. Although our present ability to determine the

1989 results, but there are no new tensor combinations yielding three families.
All tensor combinations turn out to fall into two classes: those where the
number of families is always divisible by three, and those where it is never
divisible by three. We find an empirical rule to determine the class, which
appears to extend beyond minimal N=2 tensor products. We observe that
distributions of physical quantities such as the number of families, singlets

the framework of decoherent histories, to the case of a particle coupled to an
environment. The usual arrival time probabilities are related to the
probability current, so we explore the properties of the current for general
open systems that can be written in terms of a master equation of Lindblad
form. We specialise to the case of quantum Brownian motion, and show that after
a time of order the localisation time the current becomes positive. We show
that the arrival time probabilities can then be written in terms of a POVM,
which we compute. We perform a decoherent histories analysis including the
effects of the environment and show that time of arrival probabilities are
decoherent for a generic state after a time much greater than the localisation
time, but that there is a fundamental limitation on the accuracy, $\delta t$,
with which they can be specified which obeys $E\delta t>>\hbar$. We confirm
that the arrival time probabilities computed in this way agree with those
computed via the current, provided there is decoherence. We thus find that the
decoherent histories formulation of quantum mechanics provides a consistent
explanation for the emergence of the probability current as the classical
arrival time distribution, and a systematic rule for deciding when
probabilities may be assigned.

related to the time extension of chosen datasets, but consider a discrete set
of values, so to avoid arbitrariness and try and detect any possible time
period in the EoS. We test the models using a recent collection of SNeIa,
direct Hubble data and Gamma Ray Bursts data. Main results are: I. even if
constraints on the amplitude are not too strong, we detect a trend of it versus
the frequency, i.e. decreasing (and even negatives) amplitudes for higher
frequencies; II. the centre of oscillation (which corresponds to the present
value of the EoS parameter) is very well constrained, phantom behaviour is
excluded at $1\sigma$ level and trend which is in agreement with the one for

statistical validity for all the values of the discrete set chosen, but the
best fit of all the scenarios considered is associated with a period which is

one-dimensional Brownian motion (BM), whose solution gives a stochastic process
of conformal transformation on the upper half complex-plane $\H$. As an
evolutionary boundary of image of the transformation, a random curve (the SLE
curve) is generated, which is starting from the origin and running in $\H$
toward the infinity as time is going. The SLE curves provides a variety of
statistical ensembles of important fractal curves, if we change the diffusion
constant of the driving BM. In the present paper, we consider the
Schwarz-Christoffel transformation (SCT), which is a conformal map from $\H$ to
the region $\H$ with a slit starting from the origin. We prepare a binomial
system of SCTs, one of which generates a slit in $\H$ with an angle $\alpha
\pi$ from the positive direction of the real axis, and the other of which with
an angle $(1-\alpha) \pi$. One parameter $\kappa >0$ is introduced to control
the value of $\alpha$ and the length of slit. Driven by a one-dimensional
random walk, which is a binomial stochastic process, a random iteration of SCTs
is performed. By interpolating tips of slits by straight lines, we have a
random path in $\H$, which we call an Iterative SCT (ISCT) path. It is
well-known that, as the number of steps $N$ of random walk goes infinity, each
path of random walk divided by $\sqrt{N}$ converges to a Brownian curve. Then
we expect that the ISCT paths divided by $\sqrt{N}$ (the rescaled ISCT paths)
converge to the SLE curves in $N \to \infty$. Our numerical study implies that,
for sufficiently large $N$, the rescaled ISCT paths will have the same
statistical properties as the SLE curves have, supporting our expectation.
