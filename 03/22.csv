trapped cold bosons in optical lattices can explore the grand-canonical phase
diagram of homogeneous lattice boson models, via control of the trapping
potential independently of all other experimental parameters (trap squeezing).
Based on quantum Monte Carlo, we establish the general scaling relation linking
the global chemical potential to the Hamiltonian parameters of the Bose-Hubbard
model in a parabolic trap, describing cold bosons in optical lattices; we find
that this scaling relation is well captured by a modified Thomas-Fermi scaling
behavior - corrected for quantum fluctuations - in the case of high enough
density and/or weak enough interactions, and by a mean-field Gutzwiller Ansatz
over a much larger parameter range. The above scaling relation allows to
control experimentally the chemical potential, independently of all other
Hamiltonian parameters, via trap squeezing; given that the global chemical
potential coincides with the local chemical potential in the trap center,
measurements of the central density as a function of the chemical potential
gives access to the information on the bulk compressibility of the Bose-Hubbard
model. Supplemented with time-of-flight measurements of the coherence
properties, the measurement of compressibility enables one to discern among the
various possible phases realized by bosons in an optical lattice with or
without external (periodic or random) potentials -- e.g. superfluid, Mott
insulator, band insulator, and Bose glass. We theoretically demonstrate the
trap-squeezing investigation of the above phases in the case of bosons in a
one-dimensional optical lattice, and in a one-dimensional incommensurate
superlattice.

galaxies as the trigger for significant phases of black hole growth and the
associated feedback that suppresses star formation to create red spheroidal
remnants. However, the observational evidence for the connection between
mergers and active galactic nucleus (AGN) phases is not clear. We analyze a
sample of low-mass early-type galaxies known to be in the process of migrating
from the blue cloud to the red sequence via an AGN phase in the green valley.
Using deeper imaging from SDSS Stripe 82, we show that the fraction of objects
with major morphological disturbances is high during the early starburst phase,
but declines rapidly to the background level seen in quiescent early-type
galaxies by the time of substantial AGN radiation several hundred Myr after the
starburst. This observation empirically links the AGN activity in low-redshift
early-type galaxies to a significant merger event in the recent past. The large
time delay between the merger-driven starburst and the peak of AGN activity
allows for the merger features to decay to the background and hence may explain
the weak link between merger features and AGN activity in the literature.

investigates neutrino masses and mixing without detecting neutrino. Even when
neutrino is not detected quantum mechanics relates initial and final states.
The basic physics is very simple. Neutrinos emitted in beta decay are coherent
linear combinations of states with different masses, different momenta and same
energy. Since the weak interaction producing the neutrino conserves momentum,
the initial state before the transition must also contain a coherent linear
combination of states with the same momentum difference and a well defined
relative magnitude and phase. A one-particle state with a definite momentum
difference also has an easily calculated energy difference. In the time
interval between creation of the ion and its decay a linear combination of two
states with different energies oscillates in time. Measuring the oscillation
period gives a value for the difference between squared neutrino masses of the
two neutrino mass eigenstates. The value obtained from a crude approximation
with no free parameters for this ""two-slit"" or ""which path"" experiment in
momentum space differs by less than 10% from the result observed in the KAMLAND

aspects the conventional ones. Although Herculean efforts have been undertaken
to unravel fine functioning mechanisms of the biopolymers in question, there is
still much more to be done. This particular paper presents the topic of
biomolecular charge transport, with a particular focus on charge
transfer/transport in DNA and protein molecules. Here the experimentally
revealed details, as well as the presently available theories, of charge
transfer/transport along these biopolymers are critically reviewed and

combustion, the shape of the scalar pdf is assumed a priori and the pdf is
parametrized by its moments for which model equations are solved. In
non-premixed flows the beta distribution has been a convenient choice to
represent the mixture fraction in binary mixtures or a progress variable in
combustion. Here the beta-pdf approach is extended to variable-density mixing:
mixing between materials that have very large density differences and thus the
scalar fields are active. As a consequence, new mixing phenomena arise due to
1) cubic non-linearities in the Navier-Stokes equation, 2) additional
non-linearities in the molecular diffusion terms and 3) the appearance of the
specific volume as a dynamical variable. The assumed beta-pdf approach is
extended to transported pdf methods by giving the associated stochastic
differential equation (SDE). The beta distribution is shown to be a realizable,
consistent and sufficiently general representation of the marginal pdf of the
fluid density, an active scalar, in non-premixed variable-density turbulent
mixing. The moment equations derived from mass conservation are compared to the
moment equations derived from the governing SDE. This yields a series of
relations between the non-stationary coefficients of the SDE and the mixing
physics. Our treatment of this problem is general: the mixing is mathematically
represented by the divergence of the velocity field which can only be specified
once the problem is defined. In this paper we seek to describe a theoretical
framework to subsequent applications. We report and document several rigorous
mathematical results, necessary for forthcoming work that deals with the
applications of the current results to model specification, computation and
validation of binary mixing of inert fluids.

such a limit: that is information loss due to a finite cavity bandwidth. With
an optimal feedback control to recover those information, we can surpass the
resolved-sideband limit and achieve the quantum ground state. Interestingly,
recovering those information can also significantly enhance the optomechanical
entanglement. Especially when the environmental temperature is high, the
entanglement will either exist or vanish critically depending on whether
information is recovered or not, which is a vivid example of a quantum eraser.

Metallicities may have an important effect on their properties.
  Aims: In this paper, we study the He star donor channel towards SNe Ia
comprehensively and systematically at various metallicities.
  Methods: Employing Eggleton's stellar evolution code with the optically thick
wind assumption, we calculated about 10 000 WD + He star systems and obtained
SN Ia production regions of the He star donor channel with metallicities
Z=0.03, 0.02, 0.004 and 0.0001. According to a detailed binary population
synthesis approach, we also obtained SN Ia birthrates at various metallicities.
  Results: Our study shows that both the initial mass of the He donor star and
the initial orbital period for SNe Ia increase with metallicity, while the
minimum initial mass of the carbon--oxygen white dwarfs producing SNe Ia
decreases with metallicity. For a constant star-formation galaxy, SN Ia
birthrates increase with metallicity. If a single starburst is assumed, SNe Ia
occur systemically earlier and the peak value of the birthrate is larger for a
high Z, and the He star donor channel with different metallicities can produce
the young SNe Ia with delay times $\sim$45-220Myr.

  Classical Zero-Point Radiation","30 pages This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to
  misspellings in Abstract",,,,"math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We show that for a detector rotating in a random classical zero-point
electromagnetic or massless scalar field at T=0 thermal effects exist. The
rotating reference system is constructed as an infinite set of Frenet-Seret
tetrads defined so that the detector is at rest in a tetrad at each proper
time. Correlation functions, more exactly their frequency spectrum, contain the
Planck thermal factor, and the energy density the rotating detector observes is
proportional to the sum of energy densities of Planck's spectrum at the
temperature T_rot = \hbar \Omega / (2 \pi k_B) and zero-point radiation. The
proportionality factor is (2/3)(4\gamma^2 - 1) for an electromagnetic field and
(2/9)(4\gamma^2 - 1) for a massless scalar field, where \gamma = (1 - (\Omega
r/c)^2)^(-1/2), and r is a detector rotation radius. The origin of these
thermal effects is the periodicity of the correlation functions and their
discrete spectrum, both following rotation with angular velocity \Omega. The
thermal energy can also be interpreted as a source of a vacuum force, f_vac,
applied to the rotating detector from the vacuum field. The f_vac depends on
the size of neither the charge nor the mass, like the force in the Casimir
model for a charged particle, but, contrary to the last one, it is directed to
the center of the circular orbit. The f_vac infinitely grows by magnitude when
r \to r_0 = c/\Omega, with a fixed \Omega. The orbits with a radius greater
than r_0 do not exist simply because the returning vacuum force becomes
infinite. On the uttermost orbit with the radius r_0, a linear velocity of the
rotating particle would have become c. The f_vac becomes very small and
proportional to r when r is small, r << c/\aOmega. Such vacuum force dependence
on radius, at large and small r, can be associated respectively with so called
confinement and asymptotic freedom, known in QCD, and provide a new explanation
for them.

kinds of approaches of the reservation problem. The distributed method handles
the network nodes independently, and get the nodes making their own admittance
decisions along the reservation path (i.e. Border Gateway Reservation Protocol

nodes into domains, and handles them using a network manager. Generally there
are two significant parts of the network management: intra domain, and
inter-domain. This article focuses on making reservations over several domains,

Rao-Blackwellized particle filter. In FastSLAM, particle filter is used for the
mobile robot pose (position and orientation) estimation, and an Extended Kalman
Filter (EKF) is used for the feature location's estimation. However, FastSLAM
degenerates over time. This degeneracy is due to the fact that a particle set
estimating the pose of the robot loses its diversity. One of the main reasons
for loosing particle diversity in FastSLAM is sample impoverishment. It occurs
when likelihood lies in the tail of the proposal distribution. In this case,
most of particle weights are insignificant. Another problem of FastSLAM relates
to the design of an extended Kalman filter for landmark position's estimation.
The performance of the EKF and the quality of the estimation depends heavily on
correct a priori knowledge of the process and measurement noise covariance
matrices (Q and R) that are in most applications unknown. On the other hand, an
incorrect a priori knowledge of Q and R may seriously degrade the performance
of the Kalman filter. This paper presents a Neuro-Fuzzy Multi Swarm FastSLAM
Framework. In our proposed method, a Neuro-Fuzzy extended kalman filter for
landmark feature estimation, and a particle filter based on particle swarm
optimization are presented to overcome the impoverishment of FastSLAM.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

we have analyzed the behavior of various existing replacement algorithms on L1.
The existing replacement algorithms which are taken into consideration are:
Least Recently Used (LRU), Least Frequently Used (LFU) and First In First Out

to modularize the implementation of system-wide policies. It is based on a
composition operation, called aspect weaving, that implicitly modifies a base
system by performing related changes within the system modules. Aspect-oriented
graph grammars (AOGG) extend the classic graph grammar formalism by defining
aspects as sets of rule-based modifications over a base graph grammar. Despite
the advantages of aspect-oriented concepts regarding modularity, the implicit
nature of the aspect weaving operation may also introduce issues when reasoning

means of rule-based rewriting, we can overcome these problems by using known

of dark energy models. We model dark energy with scalar fields having canonical
as well as non-canonical kinetic energy. For non-canonical case, we consider
models where the kinetic energy is of the Born-Infeld Form. We study various
potentials like linear, inverse-square, exponential as well as PNGB-type. We
also consider the case when dark energy is homogeneous as well as the case when
it is inhomogeneous and virializes together with matter. Our study shows that
models with linear potential in particular with Born-Infeld type kinetic term
can have significant deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model in terms of density
contrast at the time of virialization. Although our approach is a simplified
one to study the nonlinear evolution of matter overdensities inside the cluster
and is not applicable to actual physical situation, it gives some interesting
insights into the nonlinear clustering of matter in the presence of thawing

degenerate binaries as candidates for supernova type Ia (SN Ia) explosions. A
white dwarf merger has also been suggested to explain the formation of rare
types of stars like R CrB, extreme helium or He sdO stars. Here we present the
hot subdwarf B binary GD 687, which will merge in less than a Hubble time.
  Methods. The orbital parameters of the close binary have been determined from
time resolved spectroscopy. Since GD 687 is a single-lined binary, the spectra
contain only information about the subdwarf primary and its orbit. From high
resolution spectra the projected rotational velocity was derived. Assuming
orbital synchronisation, the inclination of the system and the mass of the
unseen companion were constrained.
  Results. The derived inclination is $i=39.3^{+6.2}_{-5.6}\,^{\circ}$. The
mass $M_{\rm 2}=0.71_{-0.21}^{+0.22}\,M_{\rm \odot}$ indicates that the
companion must be a white dwarf, most likely of C/O composition. This is only
the fourth case that an sdB companion has been proven to be a white dwarf
unambiguously. Its mass is somewhat larger than the average white dwarf mass,
but may be as high as $0.93\,M_{\rm \odot}$ in which case the total mass of the
system comes close to the Chandrasekhar limit.
  Conclusions. GD 687 will evolve into a double degenerate system and merge to
form a rare supermassive white dwarf with a mass in excess of solar. A death in
a sub-Chandrasekhar supernova is also conceivable.

of the ES-BGK kinetic equation. Numerically solving these equations are
challenging due to the nonlinear stiff collision (source) terms induced by
small mean free or relaxation time. We study an implicit-explicit (IMEX) time
discretization in which the convection is explicit while the relaxation term is
implicit to overcome the stiffness. We first show how the implicit relaxation
can be solved explicitly, and then prove asymptotically that this time
discretization drives the density distribution toward the local Maxwellian when
the mean free time goes to zero while the numerical time step is held fixed.
This naturally imposes an asymptotic-preserving scheme in the Euler limit. The
scheme so designed does not need any nonlinear iterative solver for the
implicit relaxation term. Moreover, it can capture the macroscopic fluid
dynamic (Euler) limit even if the small scale determined by the Knudsen number
is not numerically resolved. We also show that it is consistent to the
compressible Navier-Stokes equations if the viscosity and heat conductivity are
numerically resolved. Several numerical examples, in both one and two space
dimensions, are used to demonstrate the desired behavior of this scheme.

processes aimed at modeling extremes of continuous phenomena over time. They
are defined as Smith and Weissman's M4 processes with continuous functions
rather than vectors. After standardization of the margins of the observed
process into unit-Fr\'echet, CM3 processes can model the remaining
spatio-temporal dependence structure. CM3 processes have the property of joint
regular variation. The spectral processes from this class admit particularly
simple expressions. Furthermore, depending on the speed with which the
parameter functions tend toward zero, CM3 processes fulfill the finite-cluster
condition and the strong mixing condition. For instance, these three properties
put together have implications for the expression of the extremal index.
  A method for fitting a CM3 to data is investigated. The first step is to
estimate the length of the temporal dependence. Then, by selecting a suitable
number of blocks of extremes of this length, clustering algorithms are used to
estimate the total number of different profiles. The number of parameter
functions to retrieve is equal to the product of these two numbers. They are
estimated thanks to the output of the partitioning algorithms in the previous
step. The full procedure only requires one parameter which is the range of
variation allowed among the different profiles. The dissimilarity between the
original CM3 and the estimated version is evaluated by means of the Hausdorff
distance between the graphs of the parameter functions.

applied to a range of problems, particularly in the area of intrusion
detection. Ideally, the intrusion detection should be performed in real-time,
to continuously detect misuses as soon as they occur. Consequently, the
analysis process performed by an intrusion detection system must operate in
real-time or near-to real-time. The analysis process of the DCA is currently
performed offline, therefore to improve the algorithm's performance we suggest
the development of a real-time analysis component. The initial step of the
development is to apply segmentation to the DCA. This involves segmenting the
current output of the DCA into slices and performing the analysis in various
ways. Two segmentation approaches are introduced and tested in this paper,
namely antigen based segmentation (ABS) and time based segmentation (TBS). The
results of the corresponding experiments suggest that applying segmentation
produces different and significantly better results in some cases, when
compared to the standard DCA without segmentation. Therefore, we conclude that
the segmentation is applicable to the DCA for the purpose of real-time
analysis.

Feynman amplitudes of classical fields are associated to a bundle gerbe with
connection of curvature H over the target space. Under conditions that were
unraveled more than twenty years ago, the classical amplitudes may be coupled
to the topologically trivial gauge fields of the symmetry group in a way which
assures infinitesimal gauge invariance. We show that the resulting gauged
Wess-Zumino amplitudes may, nevertheless, exhibit global gauge anomalies that
we fully classify. The general results are illustrated on the example of the
WZW and the coset models of conformal field theory. The latter are shown to be
inconsistent in the presence of global anomalies. We introduce a notion of
equivariant gerbes that allow an anomaly-free coupling of the Wess-Zumino
amplitudes to all gauge fields, including the ones in non-trivial principal
bundles. The obstructions to the existence of equivariant gerbes and their
classification are discussed. The choice of different equivariant structures on

the occurrence of Stommel's retention zones, and on the splitting of their
separatrices. The goal of this paper is to analyze under which conditions these
retention zones can form, and under which conditions they can break and induce
chaotic particle settling. The terminal velocity of the particle in still fluid
is of the order of the typical velocity of the flow, and the particle response
time is much smaller than the typical flow time-scale. It is observed that if
the flow is steady and has an upward streamline where the vertical velocity has
a strict local maximum, then inertialess particle trajectories can take locally
the form of elliptic Stommel cells, provided the particle terminal velocity is
close enough to the local peak flow velocity. These structures only depend on
the local flow topology and do not require the flow to have closed streamlines
or stagnation points. If, in addition, the flow is submitted to a weak
time-periodic perturbation, classical expansions enable one to write the
particle dynamics as a hamiltonian system with one degree of freedom, plus a
perturbation containing both the dissipative terms of the particle motion
equation and the flow unsteadiness. Melnikov's method therefore provides
accurate criteria to predict the splitting of the separatrices of the elliptic
cell mentioned above, leading to chaotic particle trapping and chaotic
settling. The effect of particle inertia and flow unsteadiness on the
occurrence of simple zeros in Melnikov's function is discussed. Particle motion
in a plane cellular flow and in a vertical pipe is then investigated to
illustrate these results.

stars has revealed a need for automated analysis tools. The reason for this is
not only that individual analyses of single stars are rather time consuming,
but more importantly that these large volumes of observations open the
possibility to do population studies on large samples of stars and such
population studies demand a consistent analysis. By consistent analysis we
understand an analysis that can be performed without the need to make any
subjective choices on e.g. mode identification and an analysis where the
uncertainties are calculated in a consistent way.
  Here we present a set of automated asterosesimic analysis tools. The main
engine of these set of tools is an algorithm for modelling the autocovariance
spectra of the stellar acoustic spectra allowing us to measure not only the
frequency of maximum power and the large frequency separation, but also the
small frequency separation and potentially the mean rotational rate and the
inclination.
  The measured large and small frequency separations and the frequency of
maximum power are used as input to an algorithm that estimates fundamental
stellar parameters such as mass, radius, luminosity, effective temperature,
surface gravity and age based on grid modeling.
  All the tools take into account the window function of the observations which
means that they work equally well for space-based photometry observations from
e.g. the NASA Kepler satellite and ground-based velocity observations from e.g.
the ESO HARPS spectrograph.

the traditional grand unification scale, but we nonetheless have the same
one-loop gaugino mass relation at the electroweak scale as minimal supergravity
(mSUGRA). We introduce parameters testable at the colliders to measure the
small second loop deviation from the mSUGRA gaugino mass relation at the
electroweak scale. In the minimal SU(5) model with gravity mediated
supersymmetry breaking, we show that the deviations from the mSUGRA gaugino
mass relations are within 5%. However, in ${\cal F}$-SU(5), we predict the
deviations from the mSUGRA gaugino mass relations to be larger due to the
presence of vector-like particles, which can be tested at the colliders. We
determine the viable parameter space that satisfies all the latest experimental
constraints and find it is consistent with the CDMS II experiment. Further, we
compute the cross-sections of neutralino annihilations into gamma-rays and
compare to the first published Fermi-LAT measurement. Finally, the
corresponding range of proton lifetime predictions is calculated and found to
be within reach of the future Hyper-Kamiokande and DUSEL experiments.

to which type of repository and what kind of service best supports digital
scholarly communication, and thus the production of new knowledge. Four types
of publication repository may be distinguished, namely the subject-based
repository, research repository, national repository system and institutional
repository. Two important shifts in the role of repositories may be noted. With
regard to content, a well-defined and high quality corpus is essential. This
implies that repository services are likely to be most successful when
constructed with the user and reader uppermost in mind. With regard to service,
high value to specific scholarly communities is essential. This implies that
repositories are likely to be most useful to scholars when they offer dedicated
services supporting the production of new knowledge. Along these lines,
challenges and barriers to repository development may be identified in three
key dimensions: a) identification and deposit of content; b) access and use of
services; and c) preservation of content and sustainability of service. An
indicative comparison of challenges and barriers in some major world regions
such as Europe, North America and East Asia plus Australia is offered in
conclusion.

clear whether the star-forming gas is in global gravitational collapse or in an
equilibrium state, supported by turbulence. By studying one of the most massive
and dense star-forming regions in the Galaxy at a distance of less than 3 kpc,
the filament containing the well-known sources DR21 and DR21(OH), we expect to
find observational signatures that allow to discriminate between the two views.
We use molecular line data from our 13CO 1-0, CS 2-1, and N2H+ 1-0 survey of
the Cygnus X region obtained with the FCRAO and high-angular resolution
observations of CO, CS, HCO+, N2H+, and H2CO, obtained with the IRAM 30m
telescope. We observe a complex velocity field and velocity dispersion in the
DR21 filament in which regions of highest column-density, i.e. dense cores,
have a lower velocity dispersion than the surrounding gas and velocity
gradients that are not (only) due to rotation. Infall signatures in optically
thick line profiles of HCO+ and 12CO are observed along and across the whole
DR21 filament. From modelling the observed spectra, we obtain a typical infall
speed of 0.6 km/s and mass accretion rates of the order of a few 10^-3 Msun/yr
for the two main clumps constituting the filament. These massive (4900 and 3300
Msun) clumps are both gravitationally contracting. All observed kinematic
features in the DR21 filament can be explained if it is formed by the
convergence of flows at large scales and is now in a state of global
gravitational collapse. Whether this convergence of flows originated from
self-gravity at larger scales or from other processes can not be settled with
the present study. The observed velocity field and velocity dispersion are
consistent with results from (magneto)-hydrodynamic simulations where the cores
lie at the stagnation points of convergent turbulent flows.
