suggests, in the context of the lattice gas model, that fragments are formed at
nearly normal nuclear densities and temperatures corresponding to the Kertesz

good reproduction of the data can also be achieved at lower densities,

analysis of longitudinal categorical data. The main assumption behind these
models is that the response variables are conditionally independent given a
latent process which follows a first-order Markov chain. We first illustrate
the basic LM model in which the conditional distribution of each response
variable given the corresponding latent variable and the initial and transition
probabilities of the latent process are unconstrained. For this model we also
illustrate in detail maximum likelihood estimation through the
Expectation-Maximization algorithm, which may be efficiently implemented by
recursions known in the hidden Markov literature. We then illustrate several
constrained versions of the basic LM model, which make the model more
parsimonious and allow us to include and test hypotheses of interest. These
constraints may be put on the conditional distribution of the response
variables given the latent process (measurement model) or on the distribution
of the latent process (latent model). We also deal with extensions of LM model
for the inclusion of individual covariates and to multilevel data. Covariates
may affect the measurement or the latent model; we discuss the implications of
these two different approaches according to the context of application.
Finally, we outline methods for obtaining standard errors for the parameter
estimates, for selecting the number of states and for path prediction. Models
and related inference are illustrated by the description of relevant
socio-economic applications available in the literature.

A reworked version of the paper",,,,"math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider Bratteli diagrams of finite rank (not necessarily simple) and
ergodic invariant measures with respect to the cofinal equivalence relation on
their path spaces. It is shown that every ergodic invariant measure (finite or
""regular"" infinite) is obtained by an extension from a simple subdiagram. We
further investigate quantitative properties of these measures, which are mainly
determined by the asymptotic behavior of products of incidence matrices. A
number of sufficient conditions for unique ergodicity are obtained. One of
these is a condition of exact finite rank, which parallels a similar notion in
measurable dynamics. Several examples illustrate the broad range of possible
behavior of finite type diagrams and invariant measures on them. We then prove
that the Vershik map on the path space of an exact finite rank diagram cannot
be strongly mixing, independent of the ordering. On the other hand, for the
so-called ""consecutive"" ordering, the Vershik map is not strongly mixing on all
finite rank diagrams.

studying microscopic structure and processes. The atomic interactions necessary
for the simulation are correctly described by Quantum Mechanics. However, the
computational resources required to solve the quantum mechanical equations
limits the use of Quantum Mechanics at most to a few hundreds of atoms and only
to a small fraction of the available configurational space. This thesis
presents the results of my research on the development of a new interatomic
potential generation scheme, which we refer to as Gaussian Approximation
Potentials. In our framework, the quantum mechanical potential energy surface
is interpolated between a set of predetermined values at different points in
atomic configurational space by a non-linear, non-parametric regression method,
the Gaussian Process. To perform the fitting, we represent the atomic
environments by the bispectrum, which is invariant to permutations of the atoms
in the neighbourhood and to global rotations. The result is a general scheme,
that allows one to generate interatomic potentials based on arbitrary quantum
mechanical data. We built a series of Gaussian Approximation Potentials using
data obtained from Density Functional Theory and tested the capabilities of the
method. We showed that our models reproduce the quantum mechanical potential
energy surface remarkably well for the group IV semiconductors, iron and
gallium nitride. Our potentials, while maintaining quantum mechanical accuracy,
are several orders of magnitude faster than Quantum Mechanical methods.

interferometer with the FOV of 5.9 degrees and the spectral resolution of about
5000 to record Fraunhofer spectral lines scattered by the dust of the F-Corona.
The spectral region was centered on the MgI 5172.69 A line. The measured
line-on-sight velocities with the amplitude in the range from -10 to 10 km/s
show that during our observations the dust grains were on the orbit with a
retrograde motion in a plane nearly perpendicular to the ecliptics. This
indicates their cometary origin. Indeed, at the end of March, 2006, SOHO
recorded several sungrazing comets with the orbital elements close to what was
deduced from our measurements. We conclude that the contribution of comets to
the dust content in the region close to the Sun can be more important albeit
variable in time. We also deduce that the size of the most of the dust grains

that only a small number of parameters per unit time are needed to fully
describe these signals. Unfortunately, for high rates of innovation, existing
sampling schemes are numerically unstable. In this paper we propose a general
sampling approach which leads to stable recovery even in the presence of many
pulses. We begin by deriving a condition on the sampling kernel which allows
perfect reconstruction of periodic streams from the minimal number of samples.
We then design a compactly supported class of filters, satisfying this
condition. The periodic solution is extended to finite and infinite streams,
and is shown to be numerically stable even for a large number of pulses. High
noise robustness is also demonstrated when the delays are sufficiently
separated. Finally, we process ultrasound imaging data using our techniques,
and show that substantial rate reduction with respect to traditional ultrasound
sampling schemes can be achieved.

the lone stable chimera observed in continuous rings of oscillators, we find
that this system exhibits \emph{two coexisting stable chimeras}. Both chimeras
are, as usual, born through a saddle node bifurcation. As the coupling becomes
increasingly local in nature they lose stability through a Hopf bifurcation,
giving rise to breathing chimeras, which in turn get destroyed through a

DM mass ratio in a halo is equal to half the baryon to DM ratio of the
Universe. The filter mass has previously been used in semianalytic calculations
of galaxy formation, without taking into account the possible existence of a
primordial magnetic field. We examine here its effect on the filter mass. For
homogeneous comoving primordial magnetic fields of $B_0 \sim 1$ or 2 nG and a
reionization epoch that starts at a redshift $z_s=11$ and is completed at
$z_r=8$, the filter mass is increased at redshift 8, for example, by factors
4.1 and 19.8, respectively. The dependence of the filter mass on the parameters
describing the reionization epoch is investigated. Our results are particularly
important for the formation of low mass galaxies in the presence of a
homogeneous primordial magnetic field. For example, for $B_0\sim 1\nG$ and a
reionization epoch of $z_s\sim 11$ and $z_r\sim7$, our results indicate that
galaxies of total mass $M\sim5 \times 10^8\msun$ need to form at redshifts

early-type galaxies without large (> 10^8 M_sun) amounts of extended neutral

a significant fraction of the compact radio sources in our sample. This
segregation in HI mass with radio source size likely indicates that these

central region, or that their fuelling is inefficient and different from the

packet arrival rates and instantaneous packet counts at a router in a
communication network, where the arrivals of packets in each flow follow a
Poisson process. Assuming that the rate vector of this Poisson process is
sparse or approximately sparse, the goal is to maintain a compressed summary of
the process sample paths using a small number of counters, such that at any
time it is possible to reconstruct both the total number of packets in each
flow and the underlying rate vector. We show that these tasks can be
accomplished efficiently and accurately using compressed sensing with expander
graphs. In particular, the compressive counts are a linear transformation of
the underlying counting process by the adjacency matrix of an unbalanced
expander. Such a matrix is binary and sparse, which allows for efficient
incrementing when new packets arrive. We describe, analyze, and compare two
methods that can be used to estimate both the current vector of total packet
counts and the underlying vector of arrival rates.

Einstein gravity and reduce to it asymptotically at large distances. Our
discussion is restricted to such theories that, similarly to Einstein gravity,
contain black holes as semiclassical states in a range of scales. We show that,
at a given scale, the entropy of these black holes has to be larger than the
number of elementary light species in the theory. Our bound follows from the
observation that the black hole entropy has to be larger than the product of
its mass and horizon radius (in units of Planck's constant divided by the speed
of light) and the fact that, for any semiclassical black hole, this product has
to be larger than the number of light species. For theories that obey our
assumptions, the bound resolves the ""species problem"": the tension between the
geometric, species-independent nature of black hole entropy and the
proportionality of ordinary thermodynamic entropy to the number of species. We
then show that, when black holes in Einstein's theory are compared to those in
the extended theories at a fixed value of mass, the entropy of the Einstein
black holes will always be minimal. Similar considerations are also applied to
the entropy density of black branes in anti-de Sitter space.

for realization of a fault-tolerant quantum computer. The topological approach
to quantum computation proposes to surmount this obstacle by using special
physical systems -- non-Abelian topologically ordered phases of matter -- that
would provide intrinsic fault-tolerance at the hardware level. The so-called
""Ising-type"" non-Abelian topological order is likely to be physically realized
in a number of systems, but it can only provide a universal gate set (a
requisite for quantum computation) if one has the ability to perform certain
dynamical topology-changing operations on the system. Until now, practical
methods of implementing these operations were unknown. Here we show how the
necessary operations can be physically implemented for Ising-type systems
realized in the recently proposed superconductor-semiconductor and
superconductor-topological insulator heterostructures. Furthermore, we specify
routines employing these methods to generate a computationally universal gate
set. We are consequently able to provide a schematic blueprint for a fully
topologically-protected Ising based quantum computer using currently available
materials and techniques. This may serve as a starting point for attempts to
construct a fault-tolerant quantum computer, which will have applications to
cryptanalysis, drug design, efficient simulation of quantum many-body systems,
solution of large systems of linear equations, searching large databases,
engineering future quantum computers, and -- most importantly -- those

evolution equations, the initial data lie in the cotangent bundle of the

every lagrangian field theory with symmetries, the initial data must satisfy
constraints. But, unlike those of gauge theories, the constraints of general
relativity do not arise as momenta of any hamiltonian group action. In this
paper, we show that the bracket relations among the constraints of general
relativity are identical to the bracket relations in the Lie algebroid of a
groupoid consisting of diffeomorphisms between space-like hypersurfaces in
spacetimes. A direct connection is still missing between the constraints
themselves, whose definition is closely related to the Einstein equations, and
our groupoid, in which the Einstein equations play no role at all. We discuss
some of the difficulties involved in making such a connection.

counterparts of a X-ray source in ROSAT catalogues (namely, Bright Source
Catalogue (BSC) and Faint Source Catalogue (FSC)) were extracted by positional
cross-identification of <=30''. Because these counterparts would contain many
mis-identifications, we further imposed near-infrared colour selection criteria
and extracted reliable AGN candidates (BSC: 5,273, FSC: 10,071). Of 5,273
(10,071) candidates in the BSC (FSC), 2,053 (1,008) are known AGNs.
Near-infrared and X-ray properties of candidates show similar properties with
known AGNs and are consistent with previous studies. We also searched for
counterparts in other wavelengths (that is, optical, near-infrared, and radio),
and investigated properties in multiwavelength. No significant difference
between known AGNs and unclassified sources could be seen. However, some
unclassified sources in the FSC showed slightly different properties compared
with known AGNs. Consequently, it is highly probable that we could extract
reliable AGN candidates though candidates in the FSC might be spurious.

just outside the moat region of a sunspot by using accurate spectropolarimetric
measurements and G-band images with the Solar Optical Telescope aboard Hinode.
The opposite polarity magnetic elements approach a junction of the
intergranular lanes and then they collide with each other there. The
intergranular junction has strong red shifts, darker intensities than the
regular intergranular lanes, and surface converging flows. This clearly
confirms that the converging and downward convective motions are essential for
the approaching process of the opposite-polarity magnetic elements. However,
motion of the approaching magnetic elements does not always match with their
surrounding surface flow patterns in our observations. This suggests that, in
addition to the surface flows, subsurface downward convective motions and
subsurface magnetic connectivities are important for understanding the approach
and collision of the opposite polarity elements observed in the photosphere. We
find that the horizontal magnetic field appears between the canceling opposite
polarity elements in only one event. The horizontal fields are observed along
the intergranular lanes with Doppler red shifts. This cancellation is most
probably a result of the submergence (retraction) of low-lying photospheric
magnetic flux. In the other 4 events, the horizontal field is not observed
between the opposite polarity elements at any time when they approach and
cancel each other. These approaching magnetic elements are more concentrated
rather than gradually diffused, and they have nearly vertical fields even while
they are in contact each other. We thus infer that the actual flux cancellation
is highly time dependent events at scales less than a pixel of Hinode SOT
(about 200 km) near the solar surface.

property, that is, its coefficients are formed by bursts of non-zero elements
corresponding to the multiband components. It is shown that this method can be
well combined with the recently proposed synchronous multi-rate sampling (SMRS)
scheme, given that the resulting linear system is sparse and formed by ones and
zeroes. The proposed method allows one to trade sampling efficiency for noise
sensitivity, and is specially well suited for bounded signals with unbounded
energy like those in communications, navigation, audio systems, etc. Besides,
it is also applicable to finite energy signals and periodic band-limited
signals (trigonometric polynomials). The paper includes a subspace method for
blindly estimating the support of the multiband signal as well as its
components, and the results are validated through several numerical examples.

specific relations. A new class of fixed-point solutions are obtained
corresponding to points which initially appear singular in the evolution
equations, but on closer inspection are actually well defined. In all cases, we
perform a phase-space analysis and obtain the late-time attractor structure of
the system. Of particular note when considering cosmological perturbations in
DBI inflation is a fixed-point solution where the Lorentz factor is a finite
large constant and the equation of state parameter of the DBI field is $w=-1$.
Since in this case the speed of sound $c_s$ becomes constant, the solution can

weaved a network of reinforcing feedbacks that led to a widespread endorsement
and extraordinary commitment by those involved in the project, beyond what
would be rationalized by a standard cost-benefit analysis in the presence of
extraordinary uncertainties and risks. The vigorous competition and race
between the initially public project and several private initiatives is argued
to support the social bubble hypothesis. We also present quantitative analyses
of the concomitant financial bubble concentrated on the biotech sector.
Confirmation of this hypothesis is offered by the present consensus that it
will take decades to exploit the fruits of the HGP, via a slow and arduous
process aiming at disentangling the extraordinary complexity of the human
complex body. The HGP has ushered other initiatives, based on the recognition
that there is much that genomics cannot do, and that ""the future belongs to
proteomics"". We present evidence that the competition between the public and
private sector actually played in favor of the former, since its financial
burden as well as its horizon was significantly reduced (for a long time
against its will) by the active role of the later. This suggests that
governments can take advantage of the social bubble mechanism to catalyze
long-term investments by the private sector, which would not otherwise be
supported.

Communication systems can be considered as contingent in space and time:
substances contain force or action, and they communicate not only in

the addition of an evolutionary perspective to the mathematical theory of

glance, a simple device. For example, Michelson in 1881 thought that he built
an instrument that (when you turn it in the horizontal plane) will measure in
vacuum (refractive index n=1) the harmonic shift of the interference fringe. In
reality the case is much more involved. Not at once it was understood (the
misunderstanding lasted about 90 years) that the shift of interference fringe
occurs only when the carriers of light contain particles, i.e. have n>1. In
1968-1975 I have demonstrated experimentally that during the pumping of the gas
from the zones where the light propagates, i.e. with decreasing the number of
particles of the light's carrier, along with the reduction of noise
disturbances always necessarily vanishes the harmonic shift of the interference
fringe. As soon as the correlation of the observability of the fringe shift
with the concentration of particles in the light's carrier has been taken into
account, I was able to reliably measure the speed of absolute motion of the
Earth as a few hundred km/s. In the sixth version I corrected the slip in
formula (21). There is suggested for experimenters the advice how to diminish
below the measurable level of the sought-for signal the harmful influence of
the noise and false interferences, and for interpreters of measurements of
non-zero fringe shift the derivation is given of a relativistically invariant
formula of the aether wind speed that agrees with the experiments in optical
media with 1<n<1.8. In the publication Phys.Lett.A 374 (2010) 1110 I reported
about measuring the horizontal projection of absolute velocity of the Earth at

dredge-up of products of He-burning, principally 12C and 16O, may convert a
18O-rich HdC star into a 18O-poor RCB star as the H-deficient star begins its
final evolution from a cool supergiant to the top of the white dwarf cooling
track.

extensive multi-frequency radio continuum and HI absorption observations with
the VLA and MERLIN. Toward the center of NGC1614, we have detected a ring of
radio continuum emission with a radius of 300 pc. This ring is coincident with
previous radio and Paschen-alpha observations. The dynamical mass of the ring
based on HI absorption is 3.1 x 10E9 Msun. The peak of the integrated CO 1-0
emission is shifted by 1"" to the north-west of the ring center and a
significant fraction of the CO emission is associated with a crossing dust
lane. An upper limit to the molecular gas mass in the ring region is 1.7 x 10E9
Msun. Inside the ring, there is a north to south elongated 1.4GHz radio
continuum feature with a nuclear peak. This peak is also seen in the 5GHz radio
continuum and in the CO. We suggest that the R=300 pc star forming ring
represents the radius of a dynamical resonance - as an alternative to the
scenario that the starburst is propagating outwards from the center into a
molecular ring. The ring-like appearance probably part of a spiral structure.
Substantial amounts of molecular gas have passed the radius of the ring and
reached the nuclear region. The nuclear peak seen in 5GHz radio continuum and
CO is likely related to previous star formation, where all molecular gas was
not consumed. The LINER-like optical spectrum observed in NGC1614 may be due to
nuclear starburst activity, and not to an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN).
Although the presence of an AGN cannot be excluded.

r_c to a lower value, we may reduce leakage level, but reduce sky fraction at

a foreground mask and noise level. We have applied our method to a simulated

leakage power is smaller than primordial (i.e. unlensed) B mode power spectrum

the network with three populations represents an interesting case because the
populations may either be connected as a triangle, or as a chain, thereby
representing the simplest discrete network of either a ring or a line segment
of oscillator populations. We introduce a special parameter that allows us to
study the effect of breaking the triangular network structure, and to vary the
network symmetry continuously such that it becomes more and more chain-like. By
showing that chimera states only exist for a bounded set of parameter values we
demonstrate that their existence depends strongly on the underlying network
structures. We conclude that chimeras exist on networks with a chain-like
character, which indicates that it might be possible to observe chimeras on a
continuous line segment of oscillators.

determines the explosion brightness, namely the mass of the exploding white
dwarf. Here we perform one-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations, associated
post-processing nucleosynthesis and multi-wavelength radiation transport
calculations for pure detonations of carbon-oxygen white dwarfs. The light
curves and spectra we obtain from these simulations are in good agreement with
observed properties of Type Ia supernovae. In particular, for white dwarf
masses from 0.97 - 1.15 Msun we obtain 56Ni masses between 0.3 and 0.8 Msun,
sufficient to capture almost the complete range of Type Ia supernova
brightnesses. Our optical light curve rise times, peak colours and decline
timescales display trends which are generally consistent with observed
characteristics although the range of B-band decline timescales displayed by
our current set of models is somewhat too narrow. In agreement with
observations, the maximum light spectra of the models show clear features
associated with intermediate mass elements and reproduce the sense of the
observed correlation between explosion luminosity and the ratio of the Si II
lines at 6355 and 5972 Angstroms. We therefore suggest that sub-Chandrasekhar
mass explosions are a viable model for Type Ia supernovae for any binary
evolution scenario leading to explosions in which the optical display is
dominated by the material produced in a detonation of the primary white dwarf.

evolutionary processes on various classes of complex networks, including random
graphs, scale-free and small world networks. We find that scale-free and random
graphs lead to a strong stabilization of coexistence both for the Moran process

stronger compared to a lattice topology, and is mainly caused by the degree
heterogeneity of the graph. However, evolutionary processes on graphs can be
defined in many variants, and we show that in a process using effective payoffs
the effect of the network topology can be completely reversed. Thus,
stabilization of coexistence depends on both network geometry and underlying

of embedding Split ring resonators (SRR) in a frequency- dispersive medium with
Lorentz-like dispersion or with dispersion engineered by electromagnetic
induced transparency (EIT), is manifested in the splitting of the negative
permeability band, the modified (frequency-dependent) filling fractions and
dissipation factors. The modified material parameters are strongly linked to
the resonant frequencies of the medium, while for an embedding medium
exhibiting EIT, also to the strength and detuning of the control field. The
robustness of control against the deleterious influence of dissipation
associated with the metallic structures as well as the inhomogeneous broadening
due to structural imperfections is demonstrated. Studies on plasmonic
metamaterials that consist of metallic nanorods arranged in loops and exhibit a
collective magnetic response at optical frequencies are presented. Control and

constrain star and structure formation models, as well as the chemical
evolution in the early Universe. Spectral lines from atoms and molecules in
primordial perturbations at high redshifts can give information about the
conditions in the early universe before and during the formation of the first
stars in addition to the epoch of reionisation. The lines may arise from moving
primordial perturbations before the formation of the first stars (resonant
scattering lines), or could be thermal absorption or emission lines at lower
redshifts. The difficulties in these searches are that the source redshift and
evolutionary state, as well as molecular species and transition are unknown,
which implies that an observed line can fall within a wide range of
frequencies. The lines are also expected to be very weak. Observations from
space have the advantages of stability and the lack of atmospheric features
which is important in such observations. We have therefore, as a first step in
our searches, used the Odin satellite to perform two sets of spectral line
surveys towards several positions. The first survey covered the band 547-578
GHz towards two positions, and the second one covered the bands 542.0-547.5 GHz
and 486.5-492.0 GHz towards six positions selected to test different sizes of
the primordial clouds. Two deep searches centred at 543.250 and 543.100 GHz
with 1 GHz bandwidth were also performed towards one position. The two lowest
rotational transitions of H2 will be redshifted to these frequencies from
z~20-30, which is the predicted epoch of the first star formation. No lines are
detected at an rms level of 14-90 and 5-35 mK for the two surveys,
respectively, and 2-7 mK in the deep searches with a channel spacing of 1-16
MHz. The broad bandwidth covered allows a wide range of redshifts to be
explored for a number of atomic and molecular species and transitions. From the
theoretical side, our sensitivity analysis show that the largest possible
amplitudes of the resonant lines are about 1 mK at frequencies <200 GHz, and a
few micro K around 500-600 GHz, assuming optically thick lines and no
beam-dilution. However, if existing, thermal absorption lines have the
potential to be orders of magnitude stronger than the resonant lines. We make a
simple estimation of the sizes and masses of the primordial perturbations at
their turn-around epochs, which previously has been identified as the most
favourable epoch for a detection. This work may be considered as an important
pilot study for our forthcoming observations with the Herschel Space
Observatory.

reconstructed temperature for the past 400,000 years (Antarctic ice cores data)
are completely dominated by one-third subharmonic resonance, presumably related
to Earth precession effect on the energy that the intertropical regions receive
from the Sun. Effects of Galactic turbulence on the temperature fluctuations
are also discussed. Direct evidence of chaotic response of the atmospheric CO_2
dynamics to obliquity periodic forcing has been found in a reconstruction of
atmospheric CO_2 data (deep sea proxies), for the past 650,000 years.

the Ising spin glass. We find that a phase transition takes place during the
aging process. Statics-dynamics correspondence implies that systems of finite
size in equilibrium have static heterogeneities that obey Finite-Size Scaling,
thus signaling an analogous phase transition in the thermodynamical limit. We
compute the critical exponents and the transition point in the equilibrium
setting, and use them to show that aging in dynamic heterogeneities can be
described by a Finite-Time Scaling Ansatz, with potential implications for
experimental work.

exactly two edges and every other point belongs to at most one edge. Brass,
Moser and Pach asked the following question: For n > 3 odd, what is the maximum
perimeter of a simple n-gon contained in a Euclidean unit disk? In 2009, Audet,
Hansen and Messine answered this question, and showed that the supremum is the
perimeter of an isosceles triangle inscribed in the disk, with an edge of
multiplicity n-2. L\'angi generalized their result for polygons contained in a
hyperbolic disk. In this note we find the supremum of the perimeters of simple
n-gons contained in an arbitrary plane convex body in the Euclidean or in the
hyperbolic plane.

overview of recent developments in nuclear structure theory aiming at the
description of these interaction-induced correlations by unitary
transformations. We focus on the Unitary Correlation Operator Method (UCOM),
which offers a very intuitive, universal and robust approach for the treatment
of short-range correlations. We discuss the UCOM formalism in detail and
highlight the connections to other methods for the description of short-range
correlations and the construction of effective interactions. In particular, we
juxtapose UCOM with the Similarity Renormalization Group (SRG) approach, which
implements the unitary transformation of the Hamiltonian through a very
flexible flow-equation formulation. The UCOM- and SRG-transformed interactions
are compared on the level of matrix elements and in many-body calculations
within the no-core shell model and with Hartree-Fock plus perturbation theory
for a variety of nuclei and observables. These calculations provide a detailed
picture of the similarities and differences as well as the advantages and
limitations of unitary transformation methods.

well studied Spitzer fields preferentially selecting fields already rich in
multi-wavelength data from radio to X-ray wavelengths filling in the wavelength
desert between the Spitzer IRAC and MIPS bands.We present the initial results
for the FU-HYU survey in the GOODS-N field.We utilize the supreme
multiwavelength coverage in the GOODS-N field to produce a multiwavelength
catalogue from infrared to ultraviolet wavelengths, containing more than 4393
sources, including photometric redshifts. Using the FU-HYU catalogue we present
colour-colour diagrams that map the passage of PAH features through our
observation bands. We find that the longer mid-infrared bands from AKARI
(IRC-L18W 18 micron band) and Spitzer (MIPS24 24 micron band) provide an
accurate measure of the total MIR emission of the sources and therefore their
probable total mid-infrared luminosity. We also find that colours incorporating
the AKARI IRC-S11 11 micron band produce a bimodal distribution where an excess
at 11 microns preferentially selects moderate redshift star-forming galaxies.
These powerful colour-colour diagnostics are further used as tools to extract
anomalous colour populations, in particular a population of Silicate Break
galaxies from the GOODS-N field showing that dusty starbursts can be selected
of specific redshift ranges (z=1.2 - 1.6) by mid-infrared drop-out techniques.
The FU-HYU catalogue will be made publically available to the astronomical
community.
