towards the companions with very small masses and similar tools might be used
to study them. Unfortunately, the generally accepted treatment of the
reflection effect in interacting binaries is not very suitable to study cold
objects irradiated by hot objects or extrasolar planets. Our simple model of
the reflection effect takes into account the reflection (scattering), heating
and heat redistribution over the surface of the irradiated object. The shape of
the objects is described by the Roche potential and limb and gravity darkening
can be taken into account. The orbital revolution and rotation of the planet
with proper Doppler shifts for the scattered and thermal radiation are also
accounted for. Subsequently, light-curves and/or spectra of exoplanets were
modeled and the effects of the heat redistribution, limb darkening/brightening,
(non-)grey albedo, and non-spherical shape were studied. Recent observations of
HD189733b, WASP12b, and Wasp-19b were reproduced reasonably well. HD189733b has
low Bond albedo and intense heat redistribution. Wasp-19b has low Bond albedo
and low heat redistribution. We also calculate the exact Roche shapes and
temperature distribution over the surface of all 78 transiting extrasolar
planets known so far. It is found that the departures from the sphere vary
considerably within the sample. Departures of about 1% are common. In some
cases: WASP-12b, WASP-19b, WASP-33b departures can reach about 14, 12, and 8%,
respectively. The mean temperatures of these planets also vary considerably
from 300 K to 2600 K. The extreme cases are WASP-33b, WASP-12b, and WASP-18b

active galactic nuclei (AGN) have been extensively studied in the optical band.
We take advantage of the spectacular extension ($\sim$15"") of the NLR in the
type II Seyfert galaxy NGC 5252 and of the complementary characteristics of
$XMM$--$Newton$ and $Chandra$ to investigate the physical conditions of the gas
in this galaxy. The X-ray data from $XMM$--$Newton$ are used to define the
spectral properties of the ionising nuclear source. The $Chandra$ data are used
to trace the spatial characteristics of the soft X-ray emission. This
information is then compared to the HST characteristics. The X-ray spectrum of
the nucleus of NGC 5252 is intrinsically flat and absorbed by neutral gas with
a column density N~10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. Below 1 keV a soft excess is detected.
The high-resolution spectrum obtained with the XMM-Newton RGS shows the
presence, in the 0.2-1.5 keV range, of emission lines which strongly indicate
that the soft X-ray component is due to ionised gas. Moreover, the soft X-ray
emission is spatially resolved around and well overlaps the images obtained in
narrow [OIII] optical band. The [OIII]/soft-X flux ratios along the ionisation
cones is basically constant. This indicates that the electron density does not
significantly deviates from the r$^{-2}$ law (constant ionisation parameter).
This result combined with previous optical studies suggest two plausible but
different scenarios in the reconstruction of the last 30000 years history of
the central AGN. The most promising one is that the source is indeed a ""quasar
relic"" with steady and inefficient energy release from the accretion of matter
onto the central super-massive black-hole. This scenario is suggested also by
the flat nuclear X-ray spectrum that suggests an advection dominate accretion
flow (ADAF) like emission mechanism.

of radial fluctuations, solving the full Navier--Stokes equations numerically.
In equal-viscosity cases where an analytical linear theory is available, we
compare to the full numerical solution and delineate the regime in which the
linear theory is valid. We also consider unequal-viscosity situations (similar
to experiments) in which there is no published linear theory, and explain the
numerical results with a simple asymptotic analysis. These results are then
applied to experimental thermal drawing systems. We show that the observed
instabilities are consistent with radial-fluctuation analysis, but cannot be
predicted by radial fluctuations alone---an additional mechanism is required.
We show how radial fluctuations alone, however, can be used to analyze various
candidate material systems for thermal drawing, clearly ruling out some
possibilities while suggesting others that have not yet been considered in
experiments.

difficult to interpret. In previous works it was found that the TSDC spectrum
of cables is dominated by a broad heteropolar peak, that appears just before an
homopolar inversion, but the analysis of the cause of the peak was not
conclusive. We have used a combination of TSDC and Isothermal Depolarization
Currents (IDC) techniques to investigate further this issue. In order to
discard spurious effects from the semiconductor interfaces, samples have been
prepared in certain configurations and preliminary measurements have been done.
Then, TSDC experiments have been performed using conventional polarization
between 140C and 40C. Also, IDC measurements have been carried out between 90C
and 110C in 2C steps. The TSDC spectra show the broad peak at 95C. On the other
hand, IDC show a combination of power and exponential charge currents.
Exponential currents are fitted to a Kohlrausch--Williams--Watts (KWW) model.
The parameters obtained present approximately an Arrhenius behavior with
E_a=1.32eV, tau_0=3.29e-16s, with a KWW parameter beta=0.8. The depolarization
current calculated from the obtained parameters turns out to match the dominant
peak of TSDC spectra rather well. From the results and given the partially
molten state of the material, we conclude that the most likely cause of the
exponential IDC and the main TSDC peak is the relaxation of molecular dipoles
from additives incorporated during the manufacturing process.

e-folds accumulated during the epoch of inflation. The total number of
observable e-folds has been previously constrained by the de Sitter entropy
after inflation, assuming that the null energy condition (NEC) holds. The NEC
is violated by upward fluctuations of the local Hubble rate, which occur with
high probability in the fluctuation-dominated regime of inflation. These
fluctuations lead at late times to the formation of black holes and thus limit
the observability of inflationary evolution. I compute the maximum number
<Delta N> of e-folds that can be observed in principle through measurements of
the CMB at arbitrarily late times (if the dark energy disappears). The
calculation also provides a reasonably precise definition of the boundary of
the fluctuation-dominated regime, with an uncertainty of a few percent. In
simple models of single-field inflation compatible with current CMB
observations, I find <Delta N> of order 10^5. This upper bound on the
observable e-folds, although model-dependent, is much smaller than the de
Sitter entropy after inflation. The method of calculation can be used in other
models of single-field inflation.

solution for a long-standing problem in theoretical ecology, the so-called
""savanna problem"". The challenge is to understand why in savanna ecosystems
trees and grasses coexist in a robust way with large spatio-temporal
variability. We propose a simple model, a variant of the Contact Process (CP),
which includes two key extra features: varying external
(environmental/rainfall) conditions and tree age. The system fluctuates locally
between a woodland and a grassland phase, corresponding to the active and
absorbing phases of the underlying pure contact process. This leads to a highly
variable stable phase characterized by patches of the woodland and grassland
phases coexisting dynamically. We show that the mean time to tree extinction
under this model increases as a power-law of system size and can be of the
order of 10,000,000 years in even moderately sized savannas. Finally, we
demonstrate that while local interactions among trees may influence tree
spatial distribution and the order of the transition between woodland and
grassland phases, they do not affect dynamical coexistence. We expect dynamical
coexistence to be relevant in other contexts in physics, biology or the social
sciences.

Carlo and computationally intensive molecular dynamics, with those using the
lowest order moment formalism from the Part I. We show that, in the
high-temperature regime, the lowest order approximation gives a reliable

anti-correlation between size and stellar age, and survey for trends with the
central content of dark matter (DM). An average relation between central DM
density and galaxy size of <rho_DM> ~ Reff^-2 provides the first clear
indication of cuspy DM haloes in these galaxies -- akin to standard LCDM haloes
that have undergone adiabatic contraction. The DM density scales with galaxy
mass as expected, deviating from suggestions of a universal halo profile for
dwarf and late-type galaxies. We introduce a new fundamental constraint on
galaxy formation by finding that the central DM fraction decreases with stellar
age. This result is only partially explained by the size-age dependencies, and
the residual trend is in the opposite direction to basic DM halo expectations.
Therefore we suggest that there may be a connection between age and halo
contraction, and that galaxies forming earlier had stronger baryonic feedback
which expanded their haloes, or else lumpier baryonic accretion that avoided
halo contraction. An alternative explanation is a lighter initial mass function
for older stellar populations.

similar westward proper motion. We characterize the objects using spectroscopy
(1.45 to 2.45 micrometer) and (narrow-band) imaging from H- (1.66 mircrometer)
to L'-band (3.80 micrometer). Nine of the objects detected in both Ks- and
H-band are very red, and we find that they are all consistent with being warm
dust clumps. The dust emission may be caused by the colliding winds of the two
Wolf-Rayet stars in the cluster. Three of the six detected stars do not share
the motion or spectral properties of the three bright stars. This leaves only
the three bright, early-type stars as potential cluster members. It is unlikely
that these stars are a chance configuration. Assuming the presence of an IMBH,
a mass of about 14000 solar masses follows from the velocities and positions of
these three stars. However, our acceleration limits make such an IMBH nearly as
unlikely as a chance occurrence of such a star association. Furthermore, there
is no variable X-ray source in IRS13E despite the high density of dust and gas.

a Sersic function, and parameters such as bar effective radius, ellipticity,
boxiness, length and mass, and bar-to-total luminosity and mass ratios, are
determined, which is unprecedented for a sample of this size. The properties of
bars in galaxies with classical bulges and pseudo-bulges are compared. For a
fixed bar-to-total mass ratio, pseudo-bulges are on average significantly less
massive than classical bulges, indicating that, if pseudo-bulges are formed
through bars, further processes are necessary to build a classical bulge. I
find a correlation between bar ellipticity and boxiness, and define a new
parameter as the product of these two quantities. I also find correlations
between this product and normalised bar size, between the sizes of bars and
bulges, and between normalised bar size and bulge-to-total ratio. Bars with
different ellipticities follow parallel lines in the latter two correlations.
These correlations can arise if, starting off with different normalised sizes
and ellipticities, bars grow longer and stronger with dynamical age, as a
result of angular momentum exchange from the inner to the outer parts of
galaxies, consistent with previous theoretical predictions. A plausible
consequence is that bar pattern speeds should become lower with bar dynamical
age, and towards galaxies with more prominent bulges.

extragalactic novae discovered by the Palomar 60-inch telescope during a search
for ""Fast Transients In Nearest Galaxies"" (P60-FasTING). Designed as a fast
cadence (1-day) and deep (g < 21 mag) survey, P60-FasTING was particularly
sensitive to short-lived and faint optical transients. The P60-FasTING nova
sample includes 10 novae in M31, 6 in M81, 3 in M82, 1 in NGC2403 and 1 in
NGC891. This significantly expands the known sample of extragalactic novae
beyond the Local Group, including the first discoveries in a starburst
environment. Surprisingly, our photometry shows that this sample is quite
inconsistent with the canonical Maximum Magnitude Rate of Decline (MMRD)
relation for classical novae. Furthermore, the spectra of the P60-FasTING
sample are indistinguishable from classical novae. We suggest that we have
uncovered a sub-class of faint and fast classical novae in a new phase space in
luminosity-timescale of optical transients. Thus, novae span two orders of
magnitude in both luminosity and time. Perhaps, the MMRD, which is
characterized only by the white dwarf mass, was an over-simplification. Nova
physics appears to be characterized by quite a rich four-dimensional parameter
space in white dwarf mass, temperature, composition and accretion rate.

through a ""cosmic filament"" Macci\`o et al. 2006 is a possible formation
scenario for the polar disk galaxy NGC 4650A. If polar disks form from cold
accretion of gas, the abundances of the HII regions may be similar to those of
very late-type spiral galaxies, regardless of the presence of a bright central
stellar spheroid, with total luminosity of few 10^9 Lsun. We use deep long slit
spectra obtained with the FORS2 spectrograph at the VLT in the optical and
near-infrared wavelength ranges for the brightest HII regions in the disk polar
disk of NGC 4650A. The strongest emission lines ([OII] Hbeta, [OIII], Halpha)
were used to derived oxygen abundances, metallicities and the global star
formation rates for the disk. The deep spectra available allowed us to measure
the Oxygen abundances (12 + log (O/H)) using the ""Empirical method"" based on
intensities of the strongest emission lines, and the ""Direct method"", based on
the determination of the electron temperature from the detection of weak
auroral lines, as the [OIII] at 4363 Angstrom. The Oxygen abundance measured
for the polar disk is then compared with those measured for different galaxy
types of similar total luminosities, and then compared against the predictions
of different polar ring formation scenarios. The average metallicity values for
the polar disk in NGC 4650A is Z=0.2 Zsun, and it is lower that the values
measured for ordinary spirals of similar luminosity. Moreover the gradient of
the metallicity is flat along the polar disk major axis, which implies none or
negligible metal enrichment from the stars in the older central spheroid. The
low metallicity value in the polar disk NGC 4650A and the flat metallicity
gradient are both consistent with a later infall of metal-poor gas, as expected
in the cold accretion processes.

chemical composition of their different stellar generations (from 1200 giants
in 19 GCs) to their global parameters. We propose to identify as GCs those
showing the Na-O anticorrelation, and we classify the GCs according to
kinematics and location in the Galaxy in disk/bulge, inner, and outer halo. We
find that the LF of GCs is fairly independent of their population, suggesting
that it is imprinted by the formation mechanism, and only marginally affected
by the ensuing evolution. We show that a large fraction of the primordial
population should have been lost by the proto-GCs. The extremely low Al
abundances found for the primordial population of massive GCs indicate a very
fast enrichment process before the formation of the primordial population. We
suggest a scenario for the formation of GCs including at least 3 main phases:
i) the formation of a precursor population (likely due to the interaction of
cosmological structures similar to those leading to dwarf spheroidals, but
residing at smaller Rgc, with the early Galaxy or with other structures), ii)
which triggers a large episode of star formation (the primordial population),
and iii) the formation of the current GC, mainly within a cooling flow formed
by the slow winds of a fraction of the primordial population. The precursor
population is very effective in raising the metal content in massive and/or
metal poor (mainly halo) clusters, while its role is minor in small and/or
metal rich (mainly disk) ones. Finally, we use PCA and multivariate relations
to study the phase of metal-enrichment from 1st to 2nd generation. Most of the
chemical signatures of GCs may be ascribed to a few parameters, the most
important being [Fe/H], mass, and age of the cluster, with the location within
the Galaxy also playing some role.

from the ram-pressure confined pulsar wind nebula (Guitar Nebula), is broader
in apparent width and shows evidence for spectral hardening (at 95 percent

leading edge of the feature is found to have a proper motion consistent with
that of the pulsar (~180 mas yr-1). The combined data set also provides
evidence for the presence of a counter feature, albeit substantially fainter
and shorter than the main one. Additional spectral trends along the major and
minor axes of the feature are only marginally detected in the two epoch data,
including softening counter to the direction of proper motion. Possible
explanations for the X-ray features include diffuse energetic particles being
confined by an organized ambient magnetic field as well as a simple ballistic
jet interpretation; however, the former may have difficulty in explaining
observed spectral trends between epochs and along the feature's major axis

difficult to determine a physical production scenario for these enigmatic X-ray

supernovae, is unstable to non-spherical perturbations. In three dimensions,
this Standing Accretion Shock Instability (SASI) can develop spiral modes that
spin-up the protoneutron star. Here we study these non-axisymmetric modes by
combining linear stability analysis and three-dimensional, time-dependent
hydrodynamic simulations with Zeus-MP, focusing on characterizing their spatial
structure and angular momentum content. We do not impose any rotation on the
background accretion flow, and use simplified microphysics with no neutrino
heating or nuclear dissociation. Spiral modes are examined in isolation by
choosing flow parameters such that only the fundamental mode is unstable for a
given polar index, leading to good agreement with linear theory. We find that
any superposition of sloshing modes with non-zero relative phases survives in
the nonlinear regime and leads to angular momentum redistribution. It follows
that the range of perturbations required to obtain spin-up is broader than that
needed to obtain the limiting case of a phase shift of pi/2. The bulk of the
angular momentum redistribution occurs during a phase of exponential growth,
and arises from internal torques that are second order in the perturbation
amplitude. This redistribution gives rise to at least two counter rotating
regions, with the maximum angular momentum of a given sign approaching a
significant fraction of the mass accretion rate times the shock radius squared
(Mdot * r_shock^2 ~ 1E+47 g/cm^2/s, spin period ~60 ms). Nonlinear mode
coupling at saturation causes the angular momentum to fluctuate in all
directions with much smaller amplitudes.

stacking, falls short by factors of 2-3 in resolving the extragalactic

galaxy light (IGL) through stacking, have been biased towards high values. This
is primarily due to multiple counting of the far-infrared/submillimeter flux
from 24 micron sources which are clustered within the large point spread
function of a brighter far-infrared source. Using models for the evolution of
the luminosity function at z<1.2 which are constrained by observations at 24

of self consistent mechanisms. We divide the breakdown process into three
stages: 1) we model surface failure using molecular dynamics of fracture caused
by electrostatic tensile stress, 2) we model the ionization of neutrals
responsible for plasma initiation and plasma growth using a particle in cell
code, and 3) we model surface damage by assuming a process similar to unipolar
arcing. We find that the cold, dense plasma in contact with the surface
produces very small Debye lengths and very high electric fields over a large
area, consistent with unipolar arc behavior, although unipolar arcs are
strictly defined with equipotential boundaries. These high fields produce
strong erosion mechanisms, primarily self sputtering, compatible with the
crater formation that we see. We use OOPIC modeling to estimate very high
surface electric fields in the dense plasma and measure these field using
electrohydrodynamic arguments to relate the dimensions of surface damage with
the applied electric field. We also present a geometrical explanation of the
large enhancement factors of field emitters.This is consistent with the
apparent absence of whiskers on surfaces exposed to high fields. The
enhancement factors we derive, when combined with the Fowler-Nordheim analysis
produce a consistent picture of breakdown and field emission from surfaces at
local fields of 7 - 10 GV/m. We show that the plasma growth rates we obtain
from OOPIC are consistent with growth rates of the cavity shorting currents
using x ray measurements. We believe the general picture presented here for rf
breakdown arcs should be directly applicable to a larger class of vacuum arcs.

In higher dimensions, certain cylindrical sets do lie on nodal sets

HeII regions, whereas there should be no detectable absorption from low density
gas in HeIII regions. Unlike HeII Ly-alpha absorption (the subject of much
recent study), the difficulty with using this transition to study HeII
reionization is not saturation but rather that the absorption is weak. The
Gunn-Peterson optical depth for this transition is tau ~ 0.1 x_{HeII} Delta^2
[(1+z)/5]^{9/2}, where x_{HeII} is the fraction of helium in HeII and Delta is
the density in units of the cosmic mean. In addition, HeI 584 A absorption is
contaminated by lower redshift HI Ly-alpha absorption with a comparable flux
decrement. We estimate the requirements for a definitive detection of
redshifted HeI absorption from low density gas (Delta ~ 1), which would
indicate that HeII reionization was occurring. We find that this objective can
be accomplished (using coeval HI Ly-alpha absorption to mask dense regions and
in cross correlation) with a spectral resolution of 10^4 and a signal-to-noise
ratio per resolution element of ~ 10. Such specifications may be achievable on
a few known z ~ 3.5 quasar sightlines with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on

spectra is interpreted to hint on a possible conformal symmetry realization in
the light flavor baryon sector in line with AdS_5/CFT_4. The case is made by
showing that all the observed N and Delta resonances with masses below 2500 MeV
distribute fairly well each over the first levels of a unitary representation
of the conformal group, a representation that covers the spectrum of a
quark-diquark system, placed directly on the AdS_5 cone, conformally
compactified to R^1*S^3. The free geodesic motion on the S^3 manifold is
described by means of the scalar conformal equation there, which is of the
Klein-Gordon type. The equation is then gauged by the ""curved"" Coulomb
potential that has the form of a cotangent function. Conformal symmetry is not
exact, this because the gauge potential slightly modifies the conformal
centrifugal barrier of the free geodesic motion. Thanks to this, the degeneracy
between P11-S11 pairs from same level is relaxed, while the remaining states
belonging to same level remain practically degenerate. The model describes the
correct mass ordering in the P11-S11 pairs through the nucleon spectrum as a
combined effect of the above conformal symmetry breaking, on the one side, and
a parity change of the diquark from a scalar at low masses, to a pseudoscalar
at higher masses, on the other. The quality of the wave functions is
illustrated by calculations of realistic mean-square charge radii and electric
charge form-factors on the examples of the proton, and the protonic P11(1440),
and S11(1535) resonances. The scheme also allows for a prediction of the
dressing function of an effective instantaneous gluon propagator from the
Fourier transform of the gauge potential. We find a dressing function that is
finite in the infrared and tends to zero at infinity.

yield a master equation of Lindblad form similar to what one might get in the
Markovian limit with white noise, the master equation for the two coupled

is possible in the Markovian limit. Such a naive combination yields inaccurate
dynamics. To obtain the correct master equation for the composite system a

the long-term evolution of protostellar disks subject to mass addition from the
collapse of a rotating cloud core. Our model consists of a constant surface
density magnetically coupled active layer, with transport and dissipation in
inactive regions only via gravitational instability. We start our simulations
after a central protostar has formed, containing ~ 10% of the mass of the
protostellar cloud. Subsequent evolution depends on the angular momentum of the
accreting envelope. We find that disk accretion matches the infall rate early
in the disk evolution because much of the inner disk is hot enough to couple to
the magnetic field. Later infall reaches the disk beyond ~10 AU, and the disk
undergoes outbursts of accretion in FU Ori-like events as described in Zhu et
al. 2009c. If the initial cloud core is moderately rotating most of the central
star's mass is built up by these outburst events. Our results suggest that the
protostellar ""luminosity problem"" is eased by accretion during these FU
Ori-like outbursts. After infall stops the disk enters the T Tauri phase. An
outer, viscously evolving disk has structure that is in reasonable agreement
with recent submillimeter studies and its surface density evolves from $\Sigma
\propto R^{-1}$ to $R^{-1.5}$. An inner, massive belt of material-- the ""dead
zone"" -- would not have been observed yet but should be seen in future high
angular resolution observations by EVLA and ALMA. This high surface density
belt is a generic consequence of low angular momentum transport efficiency at
radii where the disk is magnetically decoupled, and would strongly affect
planet formation and migration.

intensity to overcome poor overlap between the atom pair and molecular

Here we model realistic production of a quantum degenerate gas of stable
molecules via two-photon photoassociation of Bose-condensed atoms. An adiabatic
change of the laser frequency converts the initial atomic condensate almost
entirely into stable molecular condensate, even for low-intensity lasers.
Results for dipolar LiNa provide an upper bound on the necessary
photoassociation laser intensity for alkali-metal atoms ~30 W/cm^2, indicating
a feasible path to quantum degenerate molecules beyond magnetoassociation.

disks, we explore the conditions required to explain the large outbursts of
disk accretion seen in some young stellar objects. We use one-dimensional
time-dependent disk models with a phenomenological treatment of the
magnetorotational instability (MRI) and gravitational torques to follow disk
evolution over long timescales. Comparison with our previous two-dimensional
disk model calculations (Zhu et al. 2009b, Z2009b) indicates that the neglect
of radial effects and two-dimensional disk structure in the one-dimensional
case makes only modest differences in the results; this allows us to use the
simpler models to explore parameter space efficiently. We find that the mass
infall rates typically estimated for low-mass protostars generally result in
AU-scale disk accretion outbursts, as predicted by our previous analysis (Zhu
et al. 2009a,Z2009a). We also confirm quasi-steady accretion behavior for high
mass infall rates if the values of $\alpha$-parameter for the magnetorotational
instability is small, while at this high accretion rate convection from the
thermal instability may lead to some variations. We further constrain the
combinations of the $\alpha$-parameter and the MRI critical temperature, which
can reproduce observed outburst behavior. Our results suggest that dust
sublimation may be connected with full activation of the MRI. This is
consistent with the idea that small dust captures ions and electrons to
suppress the MRI. In a later paper we will explore both long-term outburst and
disk evolution with this model, allowing for infall from protostellar envelopes
with differing angular momenta.

as the tilt angle is increased and fully collapse at $\theta_c \approx
6^\circ$. Here we theoretically investigate the topology of these structures
via a non-interacting model for the 2DEG. We account for the inter Landau-level
coupling induced by the tilted magnetic field via perturbation theory. This
coupling results in anti-crossings of Landau levels with parallel spins. With
the new energy spectrum, we calculate the corresponding $n_{2D}-B$ diagram of
the density of states (DOS) near the Fermi level. We argue that the DOS
displays the same topology as $\rho_{xx}$ in the $n_{2D}-B$ diagram. For the
ring with filling factor $\nu=4$, we find that the anti-crossings make it
shrink for increasing tilt angles and collapse at a large enough angle. Using
effective parameters to fit the $\theta = 0^\circ$ data, we find a collapsing
angle $\theta_c \approx 3.6^\circ$. Despite this factor-of-two discrepancy with
the experimental data, our model captures the essential mechanism underlying
the ring collapse.

properties between a single spin and a ferromagnet. In other words, the
ferromagnet order has a relatively long life time, and yet the nanodisk spin
can be rotated by external field or current. We consider a nanodisk connected

counts at S(850\mu m) < 2.0 mJy from various SCUBA surveys towards lensing

variational approach to study quantum phase and quantum phase transitions,
especially topological ordered phases which are impossible to handle with
conventional methods due to their long range entanglement. However, an
important issue arises when we use tensor product states (TPS) as variational
states to find the ground state of a Hamiltonian: can arbitrary variations in
the tensors that represent ground state of a Hamiltonian be induced by local
perturbations to the Hamiltonian? Starting from a tensor product state which is
the exact ground state of a Hamiltonian with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order,
we show that, surprisingly, not all variations of the tensors correspond to the
variation of the ground state caused by local perturbations of the Hamiltonian.
Even in the absence of any symmetry requirement of the perturbed Hamiltonian,
one necessary condition for the variations of the tensors to be physical is
that they respect certain $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. We support this claim by
calculating explicitly the change in topological entanglement entropy with
different variations in the tensors. This finding will provide important
guidance to numerical variational study of topological phase and phase
transitions. It is also a crucial step in using TPS to study universal
properties of a quantum phase and its topological order.

investigate the nature of [OII] 3727A emission in cluster galaxies at high
redshift. Of the 401 members in the two systems, 131 galaxies have detectable
[OII] emission with no other signs of current star-formation, as well as strong
absorption features indicative of a well-established older stellar population.
The combination of these features suggests that the primary source of [OII]
emission in these galaxies is not the result of star-formation, but rather due
to the presence of a LINER or Seyfert component. Using the NIRSPEC spectrograph
on the Keck II 10-m telescope, 19 such galaxies were targeted, as well as six
additional [OII]-emitting cluster members that exhibited other signs of ongoing
star-formation. Nearly half (~47%) of the 19 [OII]-emitting, absorption-line
dominated galaxies exhibit [OII] to Ha equivalent width ratios higher than
unity, the typical value for star-forming galaxies. A majority (~68%) of these
19 galaxies are classified as LINER/Seyfert based on the emission-line ratio of
[NII] and Ha, increasing to ~85% for red [OII]-emitting, absorption-line
dominated galaxies. The LINER/Seyfert galaxies exhibit L([OII])/L(Ha) ratios
significantly higher than that observed in populations of star-forming
galaxies, suggesting that [OII] is a poor indicator of star-formation in a
large fraction of high-redshift cluster members. We estimate that at least ~20%
of galaxies in high-redshift clusters contain a LINER/Seyfert component that
can be revealed with line ratios. We also investigate the effect this
population has on the star formation rate of cluster galaxies and the
post-starburst fraction, concluding that LINER/Seyferts must be accounted for
if these quantities are to be meaningful.

2992 is known to exhibit X-ray flaring activity on timescales of days to weeks,

offer some of the highest precision measurements of the peak energy of the Fe
K$\alpha$ line, and the highest spectral resolution measurements of the width
of the core of the line in unobscured and moderately obscured ($N_{H}<10^{23} \

sources, and its centroid energy is constrained in 32 sources. In 27 sources
the statistical quality of the data is good enough to yield measurements of the
FWHM. We find that the distribution in the line centroid energy is strongly
peaked around the value for neutral Fe, with over 80% of the observations
giving values in the range 6.38--6.43 keV. Including statistical errors, 30 out
of 32 sources ($\sim 94%$) have a line centroid energy in the range 6.35--6.47
keV. The mean equivalent width, amongst the observations in which a non-zero
lower limit could be measured, was $53 \pm 3eV. The mean FWHM from the
subsample of 27 sources was $2060 \pm 230 \ \rm km \ s^{-1}$. The mean EW and
FWHM are somewhat higher when multiple observations for a given source are
averaged. From a comparison with the H$\beta$ optical emission-line widths (or,
for one source, Br$\alpha$), we find that there is no universal location of the
Fe K$\alpha$ line-emitting region relative to the optical BLR. We confirm the
presence of the X-ray Baldwin effect, an anti-correlation between the Fe
K$\alpha$ line EW and X-ray continuum luminosity. The HEG data have enabled
isolation of this effect to the narrow core of the Fe K$\alpha$ line.

noncommutativity scale to the higher-dimensional Planck scale. If the Planck
scale is of the order of a TeV, noncommutative geometry inspired black holes
could become accessible to experiments. In this paper, we present a detailed
phenomenological study of the production and decay of these black holes at the
Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Noncommutative inspired black holes are relatively
cold and can be well described by the microcanonical ensemble during their
entire decay. One of the main consequences of the model is the existence of a
black hole remnant. The mass of the black hole remnant increases with
decreasing mass scale associated with noncommutative and decreasing number of
dimensions. The experimental signatures could be quite different from previous
studies of black holes and remnants at the LHC since the mass of the remnant
could be well above the Planck scale. Although the black hole remnant can be
very heavy, and perhaps even charged, it could result in very little activity
in the central detectors of the LHC experiments, when compared to the usual
anticipated black hole signatures. If this type of noncommutative inspired
black hole can be produced and detected, it would result in an additional mass
threshold above the Planck scale at which new physics occurs.

(AMF) for image restoration. Image denoising is a common procedure in digital
image processing aiming at the removal of noise, which may corrupt an image
during its acquisition or transmission, while retaining its quality. This
procedure is traditionally performed in the spatial or frequency domain by
filtering. The aim of image enhancement is to reconstruct the true image from
the corrupted image. The process of image acquisition frequently leads to
degradation and the quality of the digitized image becomes inferior to the
original image. Filtering is a technique for enhancing the image. Linear filter
is the filtering in which the value of an output pixel is a linear combination
of neighborhood values, which can produce blur in the image. Thus a variety of
smoothing techniques have been developed that are non linear. Median filter is
the one of the most popular non-linear filter. When considering a small
neighborhood it is highly efficient but for large window and in case of high
noise it gives rise to more blurring to image. The Centre Weighted Median (CWM)
filter has got a better average performance over the median filter [8]. However
the original pixel corrupted and noise reduction is substantial under high
noise condition. Hence this technique has also blurring affect on the image. To
illustrate the superiority of the proposed approach by overcoming the existing
problem, the proposed new scheme (AMF) Adaptive Median Filter has been
simulated along with the standard ones and various performance measures have
been compared.

The enhancement of energy transfer is really exhibited with a simple model
under repeated measurements. The optimal measurement interval for the anti-Zeno
effect and the maximal efficiency of energy transfer are specified in terms of
the relevant physical parameters. Since the environment acts as frequent
measurements on the system, the decoherence-induced energy transfer, which has
been discussed recently for photosynthetic complexes, may be interpreted in
terms of the anti-Zeno effect. We further find an interesting phenomenon, where
local decoherence or repeated measurements may even promote entanglement

double Hurwitz numbers are piecewise polynomial in the orders of ramification,
and Shadrin, Shapiro and Vainshtein have determined the chamber structure and
wall crossing formulas for g=0. This paper gives a unified approach to these
results and strengthens them in several ways -- the most important being the
extension of the results of Shapiro, Shadrin and Vainshtein to arbitrary genus.
The main tool is the authors' previous work expressing double Hurwitz number as
a sum over certain labeled graphs. We identify the labels of the graphs with
lattice points in the chambers of certain hyperplane arrangements, which are
well known to give rise to piecewise polynomial functions. Our understanding of
the wall crossing for these functions builds on the work of Varchenko, and

Tomography (CT), which is an important and most common modality in medical
imaging. This is mainly due to that the effectiveness of clinical diagnosis
using CT image lies on the image quality. The denoising technique for CT images
using window-based Multi-wavelet transformation and thresholding shows the
effectiveness in denoising, however, a drawback exists in selecting the closer
windows in the process of window-based multi-wavelet transformation and
thresholding. Generally, the windows of the duplicate noisy image that are
closer to each window of original noisy image are obtained by the checking them
sequentially. This leads to the possibility of missing out very closer windows
and so enhancement is required in the aforesaid process of the denoising
technique. In this paper, we propose a GA-based window selection methodology to
include the denoising technique. With the aid of the GA-based window selection
methodology, the windows of the duplicate noisy image that are very closer to
every window of the original noisy image are extracted in an effective manner.
By incorporating the proposed GA-based window selection methodology, the
denoising the CT image is performed effectively. Eventually, a comparison is
made between the denoising technique with and without the proposed GA-based
window selection methodology.

porous medium are considered. On the basis of these effects a mechanism of
energy absorption at filling porous medium by nonwetting liquid is suggested.
In accordance with this mechanism, the absorption of mechanical energy is a
result expenditure of energy for the formation of menisci in the pores on the
shell of the infinite cluster and expenditure of energy for the formation of
liquid-porous medium interface in the pores belonging to the infinite cluster
of filled pores. It was found that in dependences on the porosity and,
consequently, in dependences on the number of filled pores neighbors, the
thermal effect of filling can be either positive or negative and the cycle of
infiltration-defiltration can be closed with full outflow of liquid. It can
occur under certain relation between percolation properties of porous medium
and the energy characteristics of the liquid-porous medium interface and the
liquid-gas interface. It is shown that a consecutive account of these
correlation effects and percolation properties of the pores space during
infiltration allow to describe all experimental data under discussion.

scalar-charge particle in a strong-field orbit around a Kerr black hole. Our
calculation specializes to circular and equatorial geodesic orbits. The
analysis is an implementation of the standard mode-sum regularization scheme:
We first calculate the multipole modes of the scalar-field perturbation using
numerical integration in the frequency domain, and then apply a certain
regularization procedure to each of the modes. The dissipative piece of the SSF
is found to be consistent with the flux of energy and angular momentum carried
by the scalar waves through the event horizon and out to infinity. The
conservative (radial) component of the SSF is found to be attractive (inward
pointing) for $r_0>r_{\rm c}(a)$ and repulsive (outward pointing) for
$r_0<r_{\rm c}(a)$, where $a$ is the Kerr spin parameter, $r_0$ is the
Boyer-Lindquist orbital radius, and $r_{\rm c}$ is a critical $a$-dependent
radius at which the conservative SSF vanishes. When the motion is retrograde
the conservative SSF is repulsive for all $r_0$ (as in the Schwarzschild case).
The dominant conservative effect of the SSF in Schwarzschild spacetime is known
to be of 3rd post-Newtonian (PN) order (with a logarithmic running). Our
numerical results suggest that the leading-order PN correction due to the black
hole's spin arises from spin-orbit coupling at 3PN, which dominates the overall
SSF effect at large $r_0$. In PN language, the change-of-sign of the radial SSF
is attributed to an interplay between the spin-orbit term ($\propto
-ar_0^{-4.5}$) and the ""Schwarzschild"" term ($\propto r_0^{-5}\log r_0$).

contradict the data, as discussed here. Instead we propose that a 90-deg
left-turn around the body-axis evolved in a common ancestor of all vertebrates.
Compensatory migrations of the tissues during development restore body
symmetry. Eyes, nostrils and forebrain compensate in the direction of the turn,
whereas more caudal structures migrate in the opposite direction. As a result
of these opposite migrations the forebrain becomes crossed and inverted with
respect to the rest of the nervous system. We show that these compensatory
migratory movements can indeed be observed in the zebrafish (Danio rerio) and
the chick (Gallus gallus). With a model we show how the axial twist hypothesis
predicts that an optic chiasm should develop on the ventral side of the brain,
whereas the olfactory tract should be uncrossed. In addition, the hypothesis
explains the decussation of the trochlear nerve, why olfaction is non-crossed,
why the cerebellar hemispheres represent the ipsilateral bodyside, why in
sharks the forebrain halves each represent the ipsilateral eye, why the heart
and other inner organs are asymmetric in the body. Due to the poor fossil
record, the possible evolutionary scenarios remain speculative. Molecular
evidence does support the hypothesis. The findings may throw new insight on the

describes an inseparable connection between quantum systems, and properties
thereof. In a quantum mechanical description even systems far apart from each
other can share a common state. This entanglement of the subsystems, although
arising from mathematical principles, is no mere abstract concept, but can be
tested in experiment, and be utilized in modern quantum information theory
procedures, such as quantum teleportation. In particular, entangled states play
a crucial role in testing our understanding of reality, by violating Bell
inequalities. While the role of entanglement is well studied in the realm of
nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, its significance in a relativistic quantum
theory is a relatively new field of interest. In this work the consequences of
a relativistic description of quantum entanglement are discussed. We analyze
the representations of the symmetry groups of special relativity, i.e. of the
Lorentz group, and the Poincar\'e group, on the Hilbert space of states. We
describe how unitary, irreducible representations of the Poincar\'e group for
massive spin 1/2 particles are constructed from representations of Wigner's
little group. We then proceed to investigate the role of the Wigner rotations
in the transformation of quantum states under a change of inertial reference
frame. Considering different partitions of the Hilbert space of 2 particles, we
find that the entanglement of the quantum states appears different in different
inertial frames, depending on the form of the states, the chosen inertial
frames, and the particular choice of partition. It is explained, how, despite
of this, the maximally possible violation of Bell inequalities is frame
independent, when using appropriate spin observables, which are related to the
Pauli-Ljubanski vector, a Casimir operator of the Poincar\'e group.

the chord function becomes evanescent. It is verified to pick out blind spots,

progress in trapping, cooling, and controlling polar molecules with large

recent letter, we have briefly discussed the application of a variational
time-dependent Hartree-Fock approach to study theoretically both the static and
the dynamic properties of such a system in a cylinder-symmetric harmonic trap.
We focused on the hydrodynamic regime, where collisions assure the equilibrium
locally. Here, we present a detailed theory, extended to encompass the general
case of a harmonic trap geometry without any symmetry. After deriving the
equations of motion for the gas, we explore their static solutions to
investigate key properties like the aspect ratios in both real and momentum
space as well as the stability diagram. We find that, despite the lack of
symmetry of the trap, the momentum distribution remains cylinder symmetric. The
equations of motion are then used to study the low-lying hydrodynamic
excitations, where, apart from the quadrupole and monopole modes, also the
radial quadrupole mode is investigated. Furthermore, we study the
time-of-flight dynamics as it represents an important diagnostic tool for
quantum gases. We find that the real-space aspect ratios are inverted during
the expansion, while the one in momentum space becomes asymptotically unity. In
addition, anisotropic features of the dipole-dipole interaction are discussed
in detail. These results could be particularly useful for future investigations
of strongly dipolar heteronuclear polar molecules deep in the quantum
degenerate regime.

algebras and neutrosophic set linear algebras are introduced in chapter four of
this book. Chapter five introduces the concept of neutrosophic group bivector
spaces, neutrosophic bigroup linear algebras, neutrosophic semigroup
(bisemigroup) linear algebras and neutrosophic biset bivector spaces. The fuzzy
analogue of these concepts are given in chapter six. An interesting feature of
this book is it contains nearly 424 examples of these new notions. The final
chapter suggests over 160 problems which is another interesting feature of this
book.

be a prime not equal to p. Results of Merkurjev and Saltman show that
H^2(F,\mu_l) is generated by Z/l-cyclic classes. We prove the ""Z/l-length"" in
H^2(F,\mu_l) equals the l-Brauer dimension, which Saltman showed to be two. It
follows that all F-division algebras of period l are crossed products, either
cyclic (by Saltman's cyclicity result) or tensor products of two cyclic
division algebras. Our result was originally proved by Suresh assuming F
contains \mu_l.

to measure the atmospheric muon charge ratio in the TeV energy region. We
analyzed 403069 atmospheric muons corresponding to 113.4 days of livetime
during the 2008 CNGS run. We computed separately the muon charge ratio for
single and for multiple muon events in order to select different energy regions
of the primary cosmic ray spectrum and to test the charge ratio dependence on
the primary composition. The measured charge ratio values were corrected taking
into account the charge-misidentification errors. Data have also been grouped
in five bins of the ""vertical surface energy"". A fit to a simplified model of
muon production in the atmosphere allowed the determination of the pion and
kaon charge ratios weighted by the cosmic ray energy spectrum.

patients and controls was analyzed under the hypothesis-rich mathematical
framework. The analysis pointed towards differential expression in blood cells
in many of the processes known or predicted to be disrupted in PD. We suggest
that circulating blood cells in PD patients can be in a full-blown
PD-expression state. We put forward the hypothesis that sporadic PD can
originate as a case of hematopoietic stem cell/differentiation process
expression program defect and suggest this research direction deserves further
investigation.

released at the IAU General Assembly on 2009 August 10. It is the first all-sky
release in this series and contains just over 100 million objects, about 95
million of them with proper motions, covering about R = 8 to 16 magnitudes.
Current epoch positions are obtained from the observations with the 20 cm
aperture USNO Astrograph's ""red lens"", equipped with a 4k by 4k CCD. Proper
motions are derived by combining these observations with over 140 ground- and
space-based catalogs, including Hipparcos/Tycho and the AC2000.2, as well as
unpublished measures of over 5000 plates from other astrographs. For most of
the faint stars in the Southern Hemisphere the Yale/San Juan first epoch plates
from the SPM program (YSJ1) form the basis for proper motions. These data are
supplemented by all-sky Schmidt plate survey astrometry and photometry obtained
from the SuperCOSMOS project, as well as 2MASS near-IR photometry. Major
differences of UCAC3 data as compared to UCAC2 include a completely new raw
data reduction with improved control over systematic errors in positions,
significantly improved photometry, slightly deeper limiting magnitude, coverage
of the north pole region, greater completeness by inclusion of double stars and
weak detections. This of course leads to a catalog which is not as ""clean"" as
UCAC2 and problem areas are outlined for the user in this paper. The positional
accuracy of stars in UCAC3 is about 15 to 100 mas per coordinate, depending on
magnitude, while the errors in proper motions range from 1 to 10 mas/yr
depending on magnitude and observing history, with a significant improvement
over UCAC2 achieved due to the re-reduced SPM data and inclusion of more
astrograph plate data unavailable at the time of UCAC2.
