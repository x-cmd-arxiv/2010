in combination with point-group symmetries. With these methods one is able to
block-diagonalize the Hamiltonian and thus to treat spin systems of
unprecedented size. In addition it provides a spectroscopic labeling by
irreducible representations that is helpful when interpreting transitions
induced by Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR), Nuclear Magnetic Resonance

definition given previously for monoidal categories with duals. A Hopf monad is
a bimonad (or opmonoidal monad) whose fusion operators are invertible. This
definition can be formulated in terms of Hopf adjunctions, which are comonoidal
adjunctions with an invertibility condition. On a monoidal category with
internal Homs, a Hopf monad is a bimonad admitting a left and a right antipode.
Hopf monads generalize Hopf algebras to the non-braided setting. They also
generalize Hopf algebroids (which are linear Hopf monads on a category of
bimodules admitting a right adjoint). We show that any finite tensor category
is the category of finite-dimensional modules over a Hopf algebroid. Any Hopf
algebra in the center of a monoidal category C gives rise to a Hopf monad on C.
The Hopf monads so obtained are exactly the augmented Hopf monads. More
generally if a Hopf monad T is a retract of a Hopf monad P, then P is a cross
product of T by a Hopf algebra of the center of the category of T-modules
(generalizing the Radford-Majid bosonization of Hopf algebras). We show that
the comonoidal comonad of a Hopf adjunction is canonically represented by a
cocommutative central coalgebra. As a corollary, we obtain an extension of
Sweedler's Hopf module decomposition theorem to Hopf monads (in fact to the
weaker notion of pre-Hopf monad).

asteroid 21 Lutetia. Several observations of this asteroid have been so far
performed, but its surface composition and nature are still a matter of debate.
For long time Lutetia was supposed to have a metallic nature due to its high
IRAS albedo. Later on it has been suggested to have a surface composition
similar to primitive carbonaceous chondrite meteorites, while further
observations proposed a possible genetic link with more evolved enstatite
chondrite meteorites. AIMS: In order to give an important contribution in
solving the conundrum of the nature of Lutetia, in November 2008 we performed
visible spectroscopic observations of this asteroid at the Telescopio Nazionale
Galileo (TNG, La Palma, Spain). METHODS: Thirteen visible spectra have been
acquired at different rotational phases. RESULTS: We confirm the presence of a
narrow spectral feature at about 0.47-0.48 micron already found by Lazzarin et
al. (2009) on the spectra of Lutetia. We also find a spectral feature at about
0.6 micron, detected by Lazzarin et al. (2004) on one of their Lutetia's
spectra. More importantly, our spectra exhibit different spectral slopes
between 0.6 and 0.75 micron and, in particular, we found that up to 20% of the
Lutetia surface could have flatter spectra. CONCLUSIONS: We detected a
variation of the spectral slopes at different rotational phases that could be
interpreted as possibly due to differences in the chemical/mineralogical
composition, as well as to inhomogeneities of the structure of the Lutetia's
surface (e.g., the presence of craters or albedo spots) in the southern
hemisphere.

tags to resources, but also retrieve resources via collaborative tags. We then
compare the model with a real-world dataset: \emph{Del.icio.us}. Indeed, the
present model shows considerable agreement with the empirical data in following
aspects: power-law hyperdegree distributions, negtive correlation between
clustering coefficients and hyperdegrees, and small average distances.
Furthermore, the model indicates that most tagging behaviors are motivated by
labeling tags to resources, and tags play a significant role in effectively
retrieving interesting resources and making acquaintance with congenial
friends. The proposed model may shed some light on the in-depth understanding
of the structure and function of folksonomy.

most fundamental problems in computational biology. Algorithms addressing the
assembly problem fall into two broad categories -- based on the data structures
which they employ. The first class uses an overlap/string graph and the second
type uses a de Bruijn graph. However with the recent advances in short read
sequencing technology, de Bruijn graph based algorithms seem to play a vital
role in practice.
  Efficient algorithms for building these massive de Bruijn graphs are very
essential in large sequencing projects based on short reads. In Jackson et. al.
ICPP-2008, an $O(n/p)$ time parallel algorithm has been given for this problem.
Here $n$ is the size of the input and $p$ is the number of processors. This
algorithm enumerates all possible bi-directed edges which can overlap with a
node and ends up generating $\Theta(n\Sigma)$ messages.
  In this paper we present a $\Theta(n/p)$ time parallel algorithm with a
communication complexity equal to that of parallel sorting and is not sensitive
to $\Sigma$. The generality of our algorithm makes it very easy to extend it
even to the out-of-core model and in this case it has an optimal I/O complexity
of $\Theta(\frac{n\log(n/B)}{B\log(M/B)})$. We demonstrate the scalability of
our parallel algorithm on a SGI/Altix computer. A comparison of our algorithm
with that of Jackson et. al. ICPP-2008 reveals that our algorithm is faster. We
also provide efficient algorithms for the bi-directed chain compaction problem.

quantifiers entering the definition of an Abelian category, which for the sake
of computability need to be turned into constructive ones. We do this
explicitly for the often-studied example Abelian category of finitely presented
modules over a so-called computable ring $R$, i.e., a ring with an explicit
algorithm to solve one-sided (in)homogeneous linear systems over $R$. For a
finitely generated maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}$ in a commutative ring $R$ we
show how solving (in)homogeneous linear systems over $R_{\mathfrak{m}}$ can be
reduced to solving associated systems over $R$. Hence, the computability of $R$
implies that of $R_{\mathfrak{m}}$. As a corollary we obtain the computability
of the category of finitely presented $R_{\mathfrak{m}}$-modules as an Abelian
category, without the need of a Mora-like algorithm. The reduction also yields,
as a by-product, a complexity estimation for the ideal membership problem over
local polynomial rings. Finally, in the case of localized polynomial rings we
demonstrate the computational advantage of our homologically motivated
alternative approach in comparison to an existing implementation of Mora's
algorithm.

solved accurately for nonlinear electron transport in a quantum wire. Based on
the calculated non-equilibrium distribution of electrons in momentum space, the
scattering effects on both the non-differential (for a fixed dc field) and
differential (for a fixed temperature) mobilities of electrons as functions of
temperature and dc field were demonstrated. The non-differential mobility of
electrons is switched from a linearly increasing function of temperature to a
parabolic-like temperature dependence as the quantum wire is tuned from an
impurity-dominated system to a phonon-dominated one [see T. Fang, {\em et al.},
\prb {\bf 78}, 205403 (2008)]. In addition, a maximum has been obtained in the
dc-field dependence of the differential mobility of electrons. The low-field
differential mobility is dominated by the impurity scattering, whereas the
high-field differential mobility is limited by the phonon scattering [see M.
Hauser, {\em et al.}, Semicond. Sci. Technol. {\bf 9}, 951 (1994)]. Once a
quantum wire is dominated by quasi-elastic scattering, the peak of the
momentum-space distribution function becomes sharpened and both tails of the
equilibrium electron distribution centered at the Fermi edges are raised by the
dc field after a redistribution of the electrons is fulfilled in a symmetric
way in the low-field regime. If a quantum wire is dominated by inelastic
scattering, on the other hand, the peak of the momentum-space distribution
function is unchanged while both shoulders centered at the Fermi edges shift
leftward correspondingly with increasing dc field through an asymmetric
redistribution of the electrons even in low-field regime [see C. Wirner, {\em

been studied by Fern\'andez and Reisenegger for neutron stars of non-superfluid
matter and by Petrovich and Reisenegger for superfluid matter, finding that the
system in both cases reaches a quasi-steady state, corresponding to a partial
equilibration between compression, due to the loss of angular momentum, and
reactions that try to restore the equilibrium. However, Petrovich and
Reisenegger assumes a constant value of the superfluid energy gap, whereas
theoretical models predict density-dependent gap amplitudes, and therefore gaps

we checked colors of stars and galaxies in the far-infrared flux-color and
color-color plots. In the resulting diagrams, stars form two clearly separated

simple method of excluding a large part of stars using the far-infrared data.
The other smaller branch, overplotting galaxies, consists of stars known to
have an infrared excess, like Vega and some fainter stars discovered by IRAS or
2MASS. The color properties of these objects in any case make them very
difficult to distinguish from galaxies. We conclude that the FIR color-color

massive objects are extremely compact with measured effective radii between

effective radii than similar mass galaxies today. Examining stellar mass
surface densities as a function of fixed physical aperture, we find an
over-density of material within the inner profiles, and an under-density in the
outer profile, within these high-z galaxies compared with similar mass galaxies
in the local universe. Consequently, massive galaxies should evolve in a way to
decrease the stellar mass density in their inner region, and at the same time
creating more extensive outer light envelopes. We furthermore show that ~ 38%

higher rate than observed for major mergers, suggesting that these galaxies are
growing in size and stellar mass in part through minor mergers during this

single scattering contribution as well as a multiple scattering contribution
which is usually neglected, especially for imaging purposes. A method based on
random matrix theory is proposed to separate the single and multiple scattering
contributions. The experimental set up uses an array of sources/receivers
placed in front of the medium. The impulse responses between every couple of
transducers are measured and form a matrix. Single-scattering contributions are
shown to exhibit a deterministic coherence along the antidiagonals of the array
response matrix, whatever the distribution of inhomogeneities. This property is
taken advantage of to discriminate single from multiple-scattered waves. This
allows one to evaluate the absorption losses and the scattering losses
separately, by comparing the multiple scattering intensity with a radiative
transfer model. Moreover, the relative contribution of multiple scattering in
the backscattered wave can be estimated, which serves as a validity test for
the Born approximation. Experimental results are presented with ultrasonic
waves in the MHz range, on a synthetic sample (agar-gelatine gel) as well as on
breast tissues. Interestingly, the multiple scattering contribution is found to
be far from negligible in the breast around 4.3 MHz.

excitations are smooth field textures, and believed to describe neutrons and
protons. We argue that a similar phenomenon occurs in topological insulators
when superconductivity gaps out their surface states. Here, a smooth texture is
naturally described by a three component real vector. Two components describe
superconductivity, while the third captures the band topology. Such a vector
field can assume a 'knotted' configuration in three dimensional space - the
Hopf texture - that cannot smoothly be unwound. Here we show that the Hopf
texture is a fermion. To describe the resulting state, the regular
Landau-Ginzburg theory of superconductivity must be augmented by a topological
Berry phase term. When the Hopf texture is the cheapest fermionic excitation,
striking consequences for tunneling experiments are predicted.

These transformations are not subject to corrections, unlike the
transformations of the fields that appear in the effective action which are
affected by the presence of higher-derivative couplings. The class of actions

this definition on particle models and on gravity. Our definition draws from
Barbour's best-matching framework developed for the purpose of implementing
spatial and temporal relationalism. Among other interesting theories, general
relativity can be derived within this framework in novel ways. We study the
detailed canonical structure of a wide range of best matching theories and show
that their actions must have a local gauge symmetry. When gauge theory is
derived in this way, we obtain at the same time a conceptual framework for
distinguishing between background dependent and independent theories. Gauge
invariant observables satisfying Kuchar's criterion are identified and, in
simple cases, explicitly computed. We propose a procedure for inserting a
global background time into temporally relational theories. Interestingly,
using this procedure in general relativity leads to unimodular gravity.

bulk and quantum-well samples by a quantum interference and control technique.
Spin separation is measured as a function of the relative strength of the two
transition pathways driven by two laser pulses. By keeping the relaxation time
of the current unchanged, we are able to relate the spin separation to the
injected average velocity. We find that the average velocity is determined by
the relative strength of the two transitions in the same way as in classical
interference. Based on this, we conclude that the density of injected pure spin
current increases monotonically with the excitation laser intensities. The
experimental results are consistent with theoretical calculations based on

anisotropy of the dispersion relation, generally present in such systems,
favors states where all electrons reside in one of the valleys. In a clean

via a finite temperature transition. In weakly disordered systems, domains of
pseudo-spin polarization are formed, which prevents macroscopic valley and

the QHE. We discuss the transport properties in the ordered and disordered

Following previous work using total group luminosity as the mass indicator,
here we split our groups by multiplicity and by estimated virial (group halo)
mass, and consider red (passive) and blue (star forming) galaxies separately.
In addition we utilise two different group catalogues (2PIGG and Yang et al.)
in order to ascertain the impact of the specific grouping algorithm and further
investigate the environmental effects via variations in the LF with position in
groups. Our main results are that LFs show a steepening faint end for early
type galaxies as a function of group mass/ multiplicity, with a much suppressed
trend (evident only in high mass groups) for late type galaxies. Variations
between LFs as a function of group mass are robust irrespective of which
grouping catalogue is used, and broadly speaking what method for determining
group `mass' is used. We find in particular that there is a significant deficit
of low-mass passive galaxies in low multiplicity groups, as seen in high
redshift clusters. Further to this, the variation in the LF appears to only
occur in the central regions of systems, and in fact seems to be most strongly
dependent on the position in the group relative to the virial radius. Finally,
distance-rank magnitude relations were considered. Only the Yang groups
demonstrated any evidence of a correlation between a galaxy's position relative
to the brightest group member and its luminosity. 2PIGG possessed no such
gradient, the conclusion being the FOF algorithm suppresses the signal for weak
luminosity--position trends and the Yang grouping algorithm naturally enhances
it.

a single parameter, namely, the volume of the ample divisor. This feature would
dramatically constrain any realistic models of particle physics embedded into
such compactifications. Broad consequences for phenomenology are discussed, in

Cnc. In 2001 and 2002, optical photometric and spectroscopic observations
revealed that HM Cnc is a very blue object with no intrinsic absorptions but
broad (FWHM 1500 km s^-1) low equivalent width emission lines (EW 1-6A), which
were first identified with the HeII Pickering series. The combination of X-ray
and optical observations pictures HM Cnc as a double degenerate binary hosting
two white dwarfs, and possibly being the shortest orbital period binary
discovered so far. The present work is aimed at studying the orbital motion of
the two components by following the variations of the shape, centroid and
intensity of the emission lines through the orbit. In February 2007, we carried
out the first phase resolved optical spectroscopic study with the VLT/FORS2 in
the High Time Resolution (HIT) mode, yielding five phase bins in the 321 s
modulation. Despite the low SNR, the data show that the intensity of the three
most prominent emission lines, already detected in 2001, varies with the phase.
These lines are detected at phases 0.2-0.6 where the optical emission peaks,
and marginally detected or not detected at all elsewhere. Moreover, the FWHM of
the emission lines in the phase resolved spectra is smaller, by almost a factor
2, than that in the the phase-averaged 2001 spectrum. Our results are
consistent with both the pulsed optical component and emission lines
originating in the same region which we identify with the irradiated surface of
the secondary. Moreover, regardless of the origin of the un-pulsed optical
continuum, we note that the EWs of the emission lines might be up to -15 /
-25A, larger than thought before; these values are more similar to those
detected in cataclysmic variables. All the findings further confirm that the
321s modulation observed in HM Cnc is the orbital period of the system, the
shortest known to date.

life to lie significantly deeper in chaos than Kauffman approach does, however
still in boundary area near `the edge of chaos and order'. The role of negative
feedbacks in stability of living objects is main of those reasons. In
Kauffman's approach regulation using negative feedbacks is not considered
sufficiently, e.g. in gene regulatory model based on Boolean networks, which
indicates therefore not proper source of stability. Large damage avalanche is
available only in chaotic phase. It models death in all living objects
necessary for Darwinian elimination. It is the first step of my approach
leading to structural tendencies which are effects of adaptive evolution of
dynamic complex (maturely chaotic) networks. 2- Introduction of s>=2 equally
probable variants of signal (state of node in Kauffman network) as
interpretively based new statistical mechanism (RSN) instead of the bias p -
probability of one of signal variants used in RBN family and RNS. It is also
different than RWN model. For this mechanism which can be treated as very
frequent, ordered phase occurs only in exceptional cases but for this approach
the chaotic phase is investigated. Annealed approximation expectations and
simulations of damage spreading for different network types (similar to CRBN,
FSRBN and EFRBN but with s>=2) are described. Degree of order in chaotic phase
in dependency of network parameters and type is discussed. By using such order
life evolve. 3- A simplified algorithm called `reversed-annealed' for
statistical simulation of damage spreading is described. It is used for
simulations presented in this and next papers describing my approach.

Kalpha, with EW of about 0.7-1 keV, and the associated Kbeta line; ii) flat

low ionisation Fe K emission follows the MC distribution, nevertheless not all
MC are Fe K emitters. The long baseline monitoring allows the characterisation
of the temporal evolution of the MC emission. A complex pattern of variations
is shown by the different MC, with some having constant Fe K emission, some
increasing and some decreasing. In particular, we observe an apparent
super-luminal motion of a light front illuminating a Molecular nebula. This
might be due to a source outside the MC (such as Sgr A* or a bright and long
outburst of a X-ray binary), while it cannot be due to low energy cosmic rays
or a source located inside the cloud. We also observe a decrease of the X-ray
emission from G0.11-0.11, behaviour similar to the one of Sgr B2. The line
intensities, clouds dimensions, columns densities and positions with respect to
Sgr A*, are consistent with being produced by the same Sgr A* flare. The
required high luminosity (about 1.5~10^39 erg/s) can hardly be produced by a
binary system, while it is in agreement with a flare of Sgr A* fading about 100
years ago. The low intensity of the Fe K emission coming from the 50 and the 20

quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The flight maneuvers are defined by a
concatenation of flight modes or primitives, each of which is achieved by a
nonlinear controller that solves an output tracking problem. A mathematical
model of the quadrotor UAV rigid body dynamics, defined on the configuration
space $\SE$, is introduced as a basis for the analysis. The quadrotor UAV has
four input degrees of freedom, namely the magnitudes of the four rotor thrusts;
each flight mode is defined by solving an asymptotic optimal tracking problem.
Although many flight modes can be studied, we focus on three output tracking
problems, namely (1) outputs given by the vehicle attitude, (2) outputs given
by the three position variables for the vehicle center of mass, and (3) output
given by the three velocity variables for the vehicle center of mass. A
nonlinear tracking controller is developed on the special Euclidean group $\SE$
for each flight mode, and the closed loop is shown to have desirable closed
loop properties that are almost global in each case. Several numerical
examples, including one example in which the quadrotor recovers from being
initially upside down and another example that includes switching and
transitions between different flight modes, illustrate the versatility and
generality of the proposed approach.

Here we
consider a structure to be tantamount to the noncrossing Watson-Crick and
\pairGU-base pairings (secondary structure) and additional cross-serial base
pairs. These interactions are called pseudoknots and are observed across the
whole spectrum of RNA functionalities. In the context of studying natural RNA
structures, searching for new ribozymes and designing artificial RNA, it is of
interest to find RNA sequences folding into a specific structure and to analyze
their induced neutral networks. Since the established inverse folding
algorithms, {\tt RNAinverse}, {\tt RNA-SSD} as well as {\tt INFO-RNA} are
limited to RNA secondary structures, we present in this paper the inverse
folding algorithm {\tt Inv} which can deal with 3-noncrossing, canonical
pseudoknot structures.
  Results: In this paper we present the inverse folding algorithm {\tt Inv}. We
give a detailed analysis of {\tt Inv}, including pseudocodes. We show that {\tt
Inv} allows to design in particular 3-noncrossing nonplanar RNA pseudoknot
3-noncrossing RNA structures--a class which is difficult to construct via
dynamic programming routines. {\tt Inv} is freely available at
\url{http://www.combinatorics.cn/cbpc/inv.html}.
  Conclusions: The algorithm {\tt Inv} extends inverse folding capabilities to
RNA pseudoknot structures. In comparison with {\tt RNAinverse} it uses new
ideas, for instance by considering sets of competing structures. As a result,
{\tt Inv} is not only able to find novel sequences even for RNA secondary
structures, it does so in the context of competing structures that potentially
exhibit cross-serial interactions.

freedom become important and appear explicitly in the equation of state. Under
the extreme conditions, the color degrees of freedom can not decouple from the
other degrees of freedom. The conservation of color charges is maintained by
introducing the color chemical potentials and their fugacities. We demonstrate
the explicit role of color degrees of freedom in the hot and dense matter of
the weakly interacting quarks and gluons. In order to illustrate our approach,
we calculate the effective colored quark and gluon propagators as well as the
hard thermal colored quark and gluon loops. The calculations are preformed
under the assumption of the hard thermal loop approximation. Finally, we
present the decay rate for the hard thermal colored quark. The present
calculation is relevant to the quarks and gluons which are not truly deconfined

the repeated convolution of a fixed number of box distributions, which have
been suitably scaled and distributed radially in an uniform fashion. The
attractive features of these box splines are their asymptotic behavior, their
simple covariance structure, and their quasi-separability. They converge to
Gaussians with the increase of their order, and are used to approximate
anisotropic Gaussians of varying covariance simply by controlling the scales of

technique for continuously controlling the size, elongation and orientation of

brings out the fragile nature of the CE-type antiferromagnetic state in half

Additionally, in comparison to x = 0.1 and 0.3 sample, the enhanced spin flip
scattering at low Q is reduced at 310K, and as temperature is reduced below

$\sim 25$ d. The object, then, entered an active state during which we observed
short flares having a timescale of 3-10 d. The object showed two types of
features in the color-magnitude relationship. One is a ""bluer-when-brighter""

the faint state. These two types of features suggest a contribution of a
thermal emission to the observed flux, as suspected in previous studies. Our
polarimetric observation detected two episodes of the rotation of the
polarization vector. The first one was a counterclockwise rotation in the $QU$
plane during the outburst state. After this rotation event of the polarization
vector, the object entered a rapidly fading stage. The second one was seen in a
series of flares during the active state. Each flare had a specific position
angle of polarization, and it apparently rotated clockwise from the first to

vector in opposite directions. We estimated a decay timescale of the short
flares during the active state, and then calculated an upper limit of the

active particles or self-propelled particles, which take energy from an
internal replenishable energy depot or ambient medium and transduce it into
useful work performed on the environment, in addition to dissipating a fraction
of this energy into heat. These individual units may interact both directly as
well as through disturbances propagated via the medium in which they are
immersed. Active particles can exhibit remarkable collective behaviour as a
consequence of these interactions, including non-equilibrium phase transitions
between novel dynamical phases, large fluctuations violating expectations from
the central limit theorem and substantial robustness against the disordering
effects of thermal fluctuations. In this chapter, following a brief summary of

branch stars, as the hydrogen envelope is too small to contribute to the
nuclear energy output. The evolution of each mass in the HR diagram occurs
along vertical tracks that, when the core helium is consumed, evolve to higher
Teff and then to the white dwarf stage. The larger is the mass, the smaller is
the Teff of the models, so that the zero age horizontal branch (ZAHB) is
""horizontal"". In this paper we show that, if the helium mass fraction (Y) of
the envelope is larger than Y~0.5, the shape of the tracks changes completely:
the hydrogen burning becomes efficient again also for very small envelope
masses, thanks to the higher molecular weight and to the higher temperatures of
the hydrogen shell. The larger is Y, the smaller is the envelope mass that
provides strong H-shell burning. These tracks have a curled shape, are located
at a Teff following the approximate relation Teff=8090+ 32900xY, and become
more luminous for larger envelope masses. Consequently, the ZAHB of the very
high helium models is ""vertical"" in the HR diagram. Synthetic models based on
these tracks nicely reproduce the location and shape of the ""blue hook"" in the
globular cluster wCen, best fit by a very high Teff (bluer) sequence with
Y=0.80 and a cooler (redder) one with Y=0.65. Although these precise values of
Y may depend on the color-Teff conversions, we know that the helium content of
the progenitors of the blue hook stars can not be larger than Y~0.38-0.40, if
they are descendants of the cluster blue main sequence. Consequently, this
interpretation implies that all these objects must in fact be progeny of the
blue main sequence, but they have all suffered further deep mixing, that has
largely and uniformly increased their surface helium abundance, during the red
giant branch evolution. A late helium flash can not be the cause of this deep
mixing, as the models we propose have hydrogen rich envelopes much more massive
than those required for a late flash. We discuss different models of deep
mixing proposed in the literature, and conclude that our interpretation of the
blue hook can not be ruled out, but requires a much deeper investigation before
it can be accepted.

  http://astro.cas.cz/bh2010/)",,,,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  On the basis of general relativity and quantum statistics, it was shown
(Neslu\v{s}an L.: 2009, Phys. Rev. D 80, 024015, arxiv:0808.3484) that the
equation of state (ES) of extremely hot Fermi-Dirac gas in the surface layer of
an ultra-relativistic compact object converges to the same form as the
relativistic equation of thermodynamical equilibrium (RETE), which is the
condition of stability of the object. The description of energy state of a gas
particle was completed with the term corresponding with the potential-type
energy. The necessity of such the term is set by the demand of convergence of
the relativistic particle-impulse distribution law to its Maxwell-Boltzmann
form in the classical limit.
  The identity of the ES and RETE, both applied to the gas in the object's
surface layer, becomes perfect, yielding the stable object, when the object's
physical radius is identical to its gravitational radius. In this state, the
internal energy of gas particles in a volume of the object's surface layer
increases over all limits in the frame of the volume and this opens the
question if the horizon of events actually is an insuperable barrier. It seems
to be possible that some matter can be temporarily lifted above the surface or,
so far, be ejected from the object and can emit a radiation detectable by a
distant observer.
  In our contribution, we demonstrate a general validity of the functional form
of the potential-type energy found in our previous work. The consistency of the
RETE with its non-relativistic approximation can occur only for this functional
form. We also point out some observational consequences of the approximate
identity of ES and RETE before the object collapses, in the proper time, to its
gravitational radius as well as the possible observational consequences of the
infinitely high internal energy in the surface layer of already collapsed
object. In general, we propagate the idea that a lot of phenomena observed at
the stellar-sized or supermassive black holes (or not-yet black holes) can be
not necessarily related to the structures in a vicinity of the black hole, e.g.
to an accretion disk, but they can be linked directly to the behaviour of the
central, ultra-compact object.

This stimulation results slower Heart rate, higher values of the standard

important issues that need to be understood in order to extend the basic
reasoning to real life cases. In particular, I emphasize the often neglected
point that degrees of beliefs are updated not by `bare facts' alone, but by all
available information pertaining to them, including how they have been
acquired. In this light I show that, contrary to what claimed in that article,
there was no ""probabilistic pitfall"" in the Columbo's episode pointed as
example of ""bad mathematics"" yielding ""rough justice"". Instead, such a
criticism could have a `negative reaction' to the article itself and to the use
of Bayesian reasoning in courts, as well as in all other places in which
probabilities need to be assessed and decisions need to be made. Anyway,
besides introductory/recreational aspects, the paper touches important
questions, like: role and evaluation of priors; subjective evaluation of Bayes
factors; role and limits of intuition; `weights of evidence' and `intensities
of beliefs' (following Peirce) and `judgments leaning' (here introduced),
including their uncertainties and combinations; role of relative frequencies to
assess and express beliefs; pitfalls due to `standard' statistical education;
weight of evidences mediated by testimonies. A small introduction to Bayesian
networks, based on the same toy model (complicated by the possibility of
incorrect testimonies) and implemented using Hugin software, is also provided,
to stress the importance of formal, computer aided probabilistic reasoning.

of freedom in quantum communication by investigating a conservative dynamical
map as a model of a dephasing quantum channel. When the channel's dynamics is
chaotic, we investigate the model's semi-classical limit and show that the
entropy exchange grows at a constant rate which depends on a single parameter
(the interaction strength), analogous to stochastic models of dephasing
channels. We analyze memory effects in the channel and present strong physical
arguments to support that the present model is forgetful in the chaotic regime
while memory effects in general cannot be ignored when channel dynamics is
regular. In order to render the non-chaotic channel forgetful, it becomes
necessary to apply a reset to the channel and this reset can efficiently be
modeled by application of a chaotic map. We may then refer to encoding theorems
(valid in the case of forgetful channels) to present evidence of a transition
from noiseless to noisy channel due to the environment's transition from
regular to chaotic dynamics.

relaxation time T_1 which is independent of the B-field at low fields. We also
find that Rashba spin-orbit induced admixture of opposite spin states in
combination with the emission of in-plane phonons provides various further
relaxation channels via deformation potential and bond-length change. In the
absence of valley mixing, spin relaxation takes place within each valley
separately and thus time-reversal symmetry is effectively broken, thus
inhibiting the van Vleck cancellation at B=0 known from GaAs quantum dots. Both
the absence of the van Vleck cancellation as well as the out-of-plane phonons
lead to a behavior of the spin relaxation rate at low magnetic fields which is
markedly different from the known results for GaAs. For low B-fields, we find
that the rate is constant in B and then crosses over to ~B^2 or ~B^4 at higher

and the local-density approximation (LDA). We then discuss the concept of the
`interacting LDA system'. This is characterised by an interacting many-body
Hamiltonian which reproduces, uniquely and exactly, the ground state density
obtained from the single-particle Kohn-Sham equations of density-functional
theory when the local-density approximation is used. We motivate why this idea
can be useful for appraising the local-density approximation in many-body
physics particularly with regards to entanglement and related quantum
information applications. Using an iterative scheme, we find the Hamiltonian
characterising the interacting LDA system in relation to the test systems of
Hooke's atom and helium-like atoms. The interacting LDA system ground state
wavefunction is then used to calculate the spatial entanglement and the results
are compared and contrasted with the exact entanglement for the two test
systems. For Hooke's atom we also compare the entanglement to our previous
estimates of an LDA entanglement. These were obtained using a combination of
evolutionary algorithm and gradient descent, and using an LDA-based
perturbative approach. We finally discuss if the position-space information
entropy of the density---which can be obtained directly from the system density
and hence easily from density-functional theory methods---can be considered as
a proxy measure for the spatial entanglement for the test systems.

also find that the vector or tensor bispectrum of $B$-mode polarization
vanishes in the squeezed limit, unless the cosmological parity is violated at

accretion disk. To explore dimensions and structure of the BLR, we analyze the
light curves of the broad H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ line fluxes and the continuum
flux. In order to find changes in the BLR, we analyze the H$\alpha$ and
H$\beta$ line profiles, as well as the change in the line profiles during the
monitoring period. First we try to find a periodicity in the continuum and
H$\beta$ light curves, finding that there is a good chance for quasi-periodical
oscillations. Using the line shapes and their characteristics (as e.g. peaks
separation and their intensity ratio, or FWHM) of broad H$\beta$ and H$\alpha$
lines, we discuss the structure of the BLR. Also, we cross-correlate the
continuum flux with H$\beta$ and H$\alpha$ lines to find dimensions of the BLR.
We found that during the monitoring period the broad emission component of the
H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ lines, and the continuum flux varied by a factor of
$\approx $4-5. Also, we detected different structure in the line profiles of
H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$. It seems that an additional central component is
present and superposed to the disk emission. In the period of high activity
(after 2002), H$\beta$ became broader than H$\alpha$ and red wing of H$\beta$
was higher than the one of H$\alpha$. We found time lags of $\sim$95 days
between the continuum and H$\beta$ flux, and about 120 days between the
continuum and H$\alpha$ flux. Variation in the line profiles, as well as
correlation between the line and continuum flux during the monitoring period is
in the favor of the disk origin of the broad lines with the possible
contribution of some additional region and/or some kind of perturbation in the
disk.

rotation-led and cessation-led reorientations, in agreement with earlier
experimental results. The ratio of the amplitude of the second Fourier mode and
the first Fourier mode rises sharply during the cessation-led reorientations.
This observation is consistent with the quadrupolar dominant temperature
profile observed during the cessations. We also observe reorientations
involving double cessation.

The symmetry underlying the Snyder geometry is deformed at the co-algebraic
level only, while its Poincar\'e algebra is undeformed. The Lorentz sector is
undeformed at both algebraic and co-algebraic level, but the co-product for
momenta (defining the star-product) is non-co-associative. The Snyder-deformed
Poincar\'e group is described by a non-co-associative Hopf algebra. The
definition of the interacting theory in terms of a non-associative star-product
is thus questionable. We avoid the non-associativity by the use of a space-time
picture based on the concept of realization of a non-commutative geometry. The
two main results we obtain are: (i) the generic (namely for any realization)
construction of the co-algebraic sector underlying the Snyder geometry and (ii)
the definition of a non-ambiguous self interacting scalar field theory on this
space-time. The first order correction terms of the corresponding Lagrangian
are explicitly computed. The possibility to derive Noether charges for the

coherently couple separate qubits. In many systems the qubits are naturally
coupled, but such an always-on interaction limits the algorithms that may be
implemented. Coupling interactions may also be directed in devices and circuits
that are provided with additional control wiring. This can be achieved by
adjusting the gate voltage in a semiconductor device or an additional flux in a
superconducting device. Such control signals must be applied adiabatically
(limiting the speed) and the additional wiring provides pathways for noise,
which leads to decoherence. Here we demonstrate an alternative approach to
coupling by exploiting the nonlinear behaviour of a degenerately doped silicon
transistor. A single transistor can exhibit a large number of individual
resonances, which are seen as changes in the source-drain current of a
dc-biased device. These resonances may be addressed in frequency space due to
their high quality factors. Two widely separated resonances are addressed and
coupled in three-frequency spectroscopy by ensuring that the third frequency
corresponds to the difference between the two individual resonances. The
nonlinearity causes the generation of additional driving signals with
appropriate frequency and phase relationships to ensure coupling, resulting in
additional spectroscopic features that could be exploited for rapid state
manipulation and gate operations.

recent years has led us to study John von Neumann's 1929 article on the quantum
ergodic theorem. We have found this almost forgotten article, which until now
has been available only in German, to be a treasure chest, and to be much
misunderstood. In it, von Neumann studied the long-time behavior of macroscopic
quantum systems. While one of the two theorems announced in his title, the one
he calls the ""quantum H-theorem"", is actually a much weaker statement than
Boltzmann's classical H-theorem, the other theorem, which he calls the ""quantum
ergodic theorem"", is a beautiful and very non-trivial result. It expresses a
fact we call ""normal typicality"" and can be summarized as follows: For a
""typical"" finite family of commuting macroscopic observables, every initial
wave function $\psi_0$ from a micro-canonical energy shell so evolves that for
most times $t$ in the long run, the joint probability distribution of these
observables obtained from $\psi_t$ is close to their micro-canonical
distribution.

the existence of a moat flow around umbral cores and pores, and the debate is
still open. Solar pores appear to be a suitable scenario to test the
moat-penumbra relation as evidencing the direct interaction between the umbra
and the convective plasma in the surrounding photosphere, without any
intermediate structure in between. The present work studies solar pores based
on high resolution ground-based and satellite observations. Local correlation
tracking techniques have been applied to different-duration time series to
analyze the horizontal flows around several solar pores. Our results establish
that the flows calculated from different solar pore observations are coherent
among each other and show the determinant and overall influence of exploding
events in the granulation around the pores. We do not find any sign of
moat-like flows surrounding solar pores but a clearly defined region of inflows
surrounding them. The connection between moat flows and flows associated to
penumbral filaments is hereby reinforced by this work.

currently known to possess swarms of Trojan asteroids - small objects that
experience a 1:1 mean motion resonance with their host planet. In Lykawka et
al. (2009), we performed extensive dynamical simulations, including planetary
migration, to investigate the origin of the Neptunian Trojan population.
Utilising the vast amount of simulation data obtained for that work, together
with fresh results from new simulations, we here investigate the dynamical
capture of Trojans by all four giant planets from a primordial trans-Neptunian
disk. We find the likelihood of a given planetesimal from this region being
captured onto an orbit within Jupiter's Trojan cloud lies between several times
10^-6 and 10^-5. For Saturn, the probability is found to be in the range <10^-6
to 10^-5, whilst for Uranus the probabilities range between 10^-5 and 10^-4.
Finally, Neptune displays the greatest probability of Trojan capture, with
values ranging between 10^-4 and 10^-3. Our results suggest that all four giant
planets are able to capture and retain a significant population of Trojan
objects from the disk by the end of planetary migration. As a result of
encounters with the giant planets prior to Trojan capture, these objects tend
to be captured on orbits that are spread over a wide range of orbital
eccentricities and inclinations. The bulk of captured objects are to some
extent dynamically unstable, and therefore the populations of these objects
tend to decay over the age of the Solar System, providing an important ongoing
source of new objects moving on dynamically unstable orbits among the giant
planets. Given that a huge population of objects would be displaced by
Neptune's outward migration (with a potential cumulative mass a number of times
that of the Earth), we conclude that the surviving remnant of the Trojans
captured during the migration of the outer planets might be sufficient to
explain the currently known Trojan populations in the outer Solar system.

consistency of concept and principle rather than conflict with experiment.
Following this Einsteinian dictum, we would first argue that homogeneity
(universal character) of space and time characterizes 'no force' (absence of
force) and leads to existence of a universal velocity while inhomogeneity
(again a universal property) characterizes curved spacetime and presence of a
universal force which is present everywhere and always. The former gives rise
to Special Relativity while the latter to General Relativity.

radiation. The self-seeding scheme was proposed to obtain a bandwidth narrower
than that achievable with conventional X-ray SASE FELs. A self-seeded FEL is
composed of two undulators separated by a monochromator and an electron beam
bypass that must compensate for the path delay of X-rays in the monochromator.
This leads to a long bypass, with a length in the order of 40-60 m, which
requires modifications of the baseline undulator configuration. As an attempt
to get around this obstacle, together with a study of the self-seeding scheme
for the European XFEL, here we propose a novel technique based on a pulse
doubler concept. Using a crystal monochromator installed within a short
magnetic chicane in the baseline undulator, it is possible to decrease the
bandwidth of the radiation well beyond the XFEL design down to 10^(-5). The
magnetic chicane can be installed without any perturbation of the XFEL focusing
structure, and does not interfere with the baseline mode of operation. We
present a feasibility study and we make exemplifications with the parameters of
the SASE2 line of the European XFEL.

interest. We use a procedure based on extinctions determined from the (H-K) vs.
(J-H) diagram, and stellar distances based on a Hipparcos calibration of the
main sequence locus: $M_J[(J-K)_0]$. The cloud confinement on the sky is
determined from contours of the average (H-K) color formed in reseaus. Along
the sight line stars affected by the clouds extinction may be extracted from
the variation of the number density of atomic hydrogen $n_H\sim
A_{V,\star}/D_\star$ to provide the cloud distance and its uncertainty.
According to our estimates, the group of three globules CB24, CB25 and CB26 is
located at 407+/-27 pc, farther than the previous estimates. CB245 and CB246
are found at 272+/-20 pc, suggesting that the current distance to these clouds
is underestimated. Toward CB244 we detect a layer at 149+/-16 pc and the cloud
at 352+/-18, in good agreement with previous studies. CB52 and CB54, though to
be at 1500 pc, are found at 421+/-28 pc and slightly beyond 1000 pc,
