small-world networks. Both numerical simulations and analytical analysis for
networks with time delay and nonlinear interaction show chaotic features in the
system response when nonlinear interaction is strong enough or the length scale

differently on different scales. Time-delay parameter also has a very strong

n+Au collisions at 200 GeV center of mass energy per nucleon pair are presented
as a function of transverse momentum and centrality. These measurements were
performed using the PHOBOS detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider
(RHIC). Nucleon-nucleus interactions were extracted from the d+Au data by
identifying the deuteron spectators. The deuteron spectators were measured
using two calorimeters; one that detected forward-going single neutrons and a
newly installed calorimeter that detected forward-going single protons. The
large suppression of high-pT hadron production in central Au+Au interactions
relative to a naive superposition of p+pbar collisions has been interpreted as
evidence of partonic energy loss in a dense medium. This interpretation is
founded upon the absence of such suppression in the yield of d+Au collisions.
It is shown that d+Au is indeed a valid reference system, as hadron production
in d+Au agrees with a simple binary collision scaling of hadron production in
p+Au. An ideal reference for Au+Au collisions is constructed using a weighted
combination of p+Au and n+Au yields and is found to be similar to the d+Au
reference. Further, hadron production in p+Au interactions is compared to that
of n+Au interactions, in order to study the transport of charge from the
initial state to mid-rapidity. No asymmetry between the positively and
negatively charged hadron spectra of p+Au and n+Au interactions is observed for
particles having an average pseudo-rapidity of 0.8. A study of the Cronin
enhancement of hadrons produced in d+Au collisions using different centrality
measures is also presented. A smooth evolution with centrality is observed,
independent of the chosen centrality measure, when centrality is parameterized
by the multiplicity density measured near mid-rapidity.

and let $C$ be a constant. In this work our goal is to find a function
$F:[n]\rightarrow \field{R}$ which optimizes the following objective function:
  $$ \min_{F} \sum_{i=1}^n (P_i-F_i)^2 + C\times |\{i:F_i \neq F_{i+1} \} | $$
  The above optimization problem reduces to solving the following recurrence,
which can be done efficiently using dynamic programming in $O(n^2)$ time:
  $$ OPT_i = \min_{0 \leq j \leq i-1} [ OPT_j + \sum_{k=j+1}^i (P_k -
(\sum_{m=j+1}^i P_m)/(i-j) )^2 ]+ C $$
  The above recurrence arises naturally in applications where we wish to
approximate the original signal $P$ with another signal $F$ which consists
ideally of few piecewise constant segments. Such applications include database
(e.g., histogram construction), speech recognition, biology (e.g., denoising
aCGH data) applications and many more.
  In this work we present two new techniques for optimizing dynamic programming
that can handle cost functions not treated by other standard methods. The basis
of our first algorithm is the definition of a constant-shifted variant of the
objective function that can be efficiently approximated using state of the art
methods for range searching. Our technique approximates the optimal value of
our objective function within additive $\epsilon$ error and runs in
$\tilde{O}(n^{1.5} \log{(\frac{U}{\epsilon}))}$ time, where $U = \max_i f_i$.
The second algorithm we provide solves a similar recurrence within a factor of
$\epsilon$ and runs in $O(n \log^2n / \epsilon)$. The new technique introduced
by our algorithm is the decomposition of the initial problem into a small
(logarithmic) number of Monge optimization subproblems which we can speed up
using existing techniques.

data associated with pairwise relationships, finding use in collaborative
filtering, computational biology, and document analysis, among other areas. In
many domains, there is additional information that can assist in prediction.
For example, when modeling movie ratings, we might know when the rating
occurred, where the user lives, or what actors appear in the movie. It is
difficult, however, to incorporate this side information into the PMF model. We
propose a framework for incorporating side information by coupling together
multiple PMF problems via Gaussian process priors. We replace scalar latent
features with functions that vary over the space of side information. The GP
priors on these functions require them to vary smoothly and share information.
We successfully use this new method to predict the scores of professional
basketball games, where side information about the venue and date of the game
are relevant for the outcome.

behaviour depends mainly on the sediment rheology and temperature distribution.
The compaction relation of pressure solution is typically assumed to be a
viscous one and is often written as a relationship between effective stress and
strain rate. A new derivation of viscous compaction relation is formulated
based on more realistic boundary conditions at grain contacts. A nonlinear
diffusion problem with a moving boundary is solved numerically and a simple
asymptotic solution is given to compare with numerical simulations. Pressure
solution is significantly influenced by the temperature gradient. Porosity
reduction due to pressure solution is enhanced in an environment with a higher
thermal gradient, while porosity decreases much slowly in the region where the
thermal gradient is small. Pressure solution tends to complete more quickly at
shallower depths and earlier time in higher temperature environment than that
in a low one. These features of pressure solution in porous sediments are
analysed using a perturbation method to get a solution for the steady state.
Comparison with real data shows a reasonably very good agreement.

sensors in a network). We consider three models of social learning in
increasing order of sophistication. In the first model, based on its private
observation of a noisy underlying state process, each agent selfishly optimizes
its local utility and broadcasts its action. This protocol leads to a herding
behavior where the agents eventually choose the same action irrespective of
their observations. We then formulate a second more general model where each
agent is benevolent and chooses its sensor-mode to optimize a social welfare
function to facilitate social learning. Using lattice programming and
stochastic orders, it is shown that the optimal decision each agent makes is
characterized by a switching curve on the space of Bayesian distributions. We
then present a third more general model where social learning takes place to
achieve quickest time change detection. Both geometric and phase-type change
time distributions are considered. It is proved that the optimal decision is
again characterized by a switching curve We present a stochastic approximation
(adaptive filtering) algorithms to estimate this switching curve. Finally, we
present extensions of the social learning model in a changing world (Markovian
target) where agents learn in multiple iterations. By using Blackwell
stochastic dominance, we give conditions under which myopic decisions are
optimal. We also analyze the effect of target dynamics on the social welfare
cost.

used to understand the bulge star formation history in early-type galaxies at
redshifts z > 2. A new technique is developed whereby observed high-redshift
age-metallicity relationships are utilized to constrain the typical formation
epochs of metal-rich or ""bulge"" globular clusters. This analysis supports a
model where massive Virgo galaxies underwent an extremely intense mode of bulge
globular cluster formation at z ~ 3.5 that was followed by an era of
significant bulge growth and little globular cluster production.
Intermediate-mass galaxies showed a less-intense period of globular cluster
formation at z ~ 2.5 that was synchronized with the bulk of bulge star growth.
The transition between the massive and intermediate-mass galaxy star formation
modes occurs at a galaxy stellar mass of M_stellar ~ 3 x 10^10 M_sun, the mass
where many other galaxy properties are observed to change. Dwarf early-type
galaxies in Virgo may have experienced no significant period of bulge globular
cluster formation, thus the intense star bursts associated with globular
cluster formation may be difficult to directly observe at redshifts z < 4.
Though the above conclusions are preliminary because they are based upon
uncertain relationships between age and metallicity, the technique employed
will yield more stringent constraints as high-redshift galaxy observations and

six 11-year cycles the average amplitude of these production changes is 36%.
These predictions are compared with measurements of 10Be concentration in polar
ice cores in both the Northern and Southern hemisphere over the same time
period. We find a large scatter between the predicted and measured yearly
average data sets and a low cross correlation ~0.30. Also the normalized
regression line slope between 10Be production changes and 10Be concentration
changes is found to be only 0.4-0.6; much less than the value of 1.0 expected
for a simple proportionality between these quantities, as is typically used for
historical projections of the relationship between 10Be concentration and solar

in the data from the Dye-3 ice core in Greenland for the time period 1939-1985,
contains a ""spike"" of high concentration one year averages which is not seen in
the production calculations. These and other features suggest that galactic
cosmic ray intensity changes which affect the production of 10Be in the Earths
atmosphere are not the sole source of the 10Be concentration changes and
confirm the importance of other effects, for example local and regional
climatic effects, which could be of the same magnitude as the 10Be production

emission properties, compared to observed ones, depending on the density and
velocity structure environment around the Lya emitting galaxy. This
environment-dependent Lya selection introduces new features in LAE clustering,
suppressing (enhancing) the line-of-sight (transverse) density fluctuations and
giving rise to scale-dependent galaxy bias. In real space, the contours of the
three-dimensional two-point correlation function of LAEs appear to be
prominently elongated along the line of sight on large scales, an effect that
is opposite to and much stronger than the linear redshift-space distortion
effect. The projected two-point correlation function is greatly enhanced in
amplitude by a factor of up to a few, compared to the case without the
environment dependent selection effect. The new features in LAE clustering can
be understood with a simple, physically motivated model, where Lya selection
depends on matter density, velocity, and their gradients. We discuss the
implications and consequences of the effects on galaxy clustering from Lya
selection in interpreting clustering measurements and in constraining cosmology

combining the large extra dimension, warped factor, and tension coupling

within high-density regions due to the first SN/pair-instability SN, local

binary merger can recoil with a velocity up to v_max ~ 4,000 km/s with respect
to the center of mass of the initial binary. This challenges the paradigm that
most galaxies form through hierarchical mergers, yet retain supermassive black
holes at their centers despite having escape velocities much less than v_max.
Interaction with a circumbinary disk can align the binary black hole spins with
their orbital angular momentum, reducing the recoil velocity of the final black
hole produced in the subsequent merger. However, the effectiveness of this
alignment depends on highly uncertain accretion flows near the binary black
holes. In this Letter, we show that if the spin S_1 of the more massive binary
black hole is even partially aligned with the orbital angular momentum L,
relativistic spin precession on sub-parsec scales can align the binary black
hole spins with each other. This alignment significantly reduces the recoil
velocity even in the absence of gas. For example, if the angle between S_1 and
L at large separations is 10 degrees while the second spin S_2 is isotropically
distributed, the spin alignment discussed in this paper reduces the median
recoil from 864 km/s to 273 km/s for maximally spinning black holes with a mass
ratio of 9/11. This reduction will greatly increase the fraction of galaxies

satisfied by epsilon-randomizing maps and approximate unitary designs.
Specifically, we show that the environment approximately forgets quantum states

case of simulating measurements that test whether the input state is an
arbitrary pure state is known as equality testing or quantum identification. An
immediate consequence of weak decoupling duality is that the ability to perform
quantum identification cannot be cloned. We furthermore establish that the
optimal amortized rate at which quantum states can be identified through a
noisy quantum channel is equal to the entanglement-assisted classical capacity
of the channel, despite the fact that the task is quantum, not classical, and
entanglement-assistance is not allowed. In particular, this rate is strictly
positive for every non-constant quantum channel, including classical channels.

generally form, resulting in groups of ultracompact H II regions, consistent
with observations. We confirm that our model reproduces the qualitative H II
region morphologies found in surveys, with generally consistent relative
frequencies. We also find that simulated spectral energy distributions (SEDs)
from our model are consistent with the range of observed H II region SEDs,
including both regions showing a normal transition from optically thick to
optically thin emission, and those with intermediate spectral slopes. In our
models, anomalous slopes are solely produced by inhomogeneities in the H II
region, with no contribution from dust emission at millimeter or submillimeter
wavelengths. We conclude that many observed characteristics of ultracompact H
II regions appear consistent with massive star formation in fast,
gravitationally unstable, accretion flows.

found signature of energetic budget of the jet in the correlation between the
peak flux of the SED (S p) and Ep. Moreover, using simultaneous Swift
UVOT/XRT/BAT data, we demonstrated, that during the strongest flares, the
UV-to-X-ray emission from Mrk 421 requires that the curved electron

curvature and its anticorrelation with Ep is consistent with both stochastic
acceleration or energy-dependent acceleration probability mechanisms, whereas
the power-law slope of XRT-UVOT data is close to that inferred from the GRBs
X-ray afterglow and in agreement with the universal first-order relativistic
shock acceleration models. This scenario implies that magnetic turbulence may
play a twofold role: spatial diffusion relevant to the first order process and
momentum diffusion relevant to the second order process.

errors, future deep weak lensing surveys should provide a better statistical
picture of the dark matter clustering beyond the level of the power spectrum.
In this context, the study of non-Gaussianity induced by gravity can help
tighten constraints on the background cosmology by breaking parameter
degeneracies, as well as throwing light on the nature of dark matter, dark
energy or alternative gravity theories. Analysis of the shear or flexion
properties of such maps is more complicated than the simpler case of the
convergence due to the spinorial nature of the fields involved. Here we develop
analytical tools for the study of higher-order statistics such as the
bispectrum (or trispectrum) directly using such maps at different source
redshift. The statistics we introduce can be constructed from cumulants of the
shear or flexions, involving the cross-correlation of squared and cubic maps at
different redshifts. Typically, the low signal-to-noise ratio prevents recovery
of the bispectrum or trispectrum mode by mode. We define power spectra
associated with each multi- spectra which compresses some of the available
information of higher order multispectra. We show how these can be recovered
from a noisy observational data even in the presence of arbitrary mask, which
introduces mixing between Electric (E-type) and Magnetic (B-type) polarization,
in an unbiased way. We also introduce higher order cross-correlators which can
cross-correlate lensing shear with different tracers of large scale structures.

structures of quantum-like theories which may initially be formulated in quite
different mathematical terms. We then use this framework to compare two
theories: quantum mechanics restricted to qubit stabiliser states and
operations, and Spekkens's toy theory. We discover that viewed within our
framework these theories are very similar, but differ in one key aspect - a
four element group we term the phase group which emerges naturally within our
framework. In the case of the stabiliser theory this group is Z4 while for
Spekkens's toy theory the group is Z2 x Z2. We further show that the structure
of this group is intimately involved in a key physical difference between the
theories: whether or not they can be modelled by a local hidden variable
theory. This is done by establishing a connection between the phase group, and
an abstract notion of GHZ state correlations. We go on to formulate precisely
how the stabiliser theory and toy theory are `similar' by defining a notion of
`mutually unbiased qubit theory', noting that all such theories have four
element phase groups. Since Z4 and Z2 x Z2 are the only such groups we conclude
that the GHZ correlations in this type of theory can only take two forms,
exactly those appearing in the stabiliser theory and in Spekkens's toy theory.
The results point at a classification of local/non-local behaviours by finite
Abelian groups, extending beyond qubits to finitary theories whose observables
are all mutually unbiased.

for the pion susceptibility; the generation of a quark anomalous chromomagnetic

$\bar J$ are new soft and jet functions, whose form is derived. These
contributions arise whenever the photon couples to light partons instead of
coupling directly to the effective weak interaction. The new contributions
appear first at order $1/m_b$ and are related to operators other than
$Q_{7\gamma}$ in the effective weak Hamiltonian. They give rise to
non-vanishing $1/m_b$ corrections to the total decay rate, which cannot be
described using a local operator product expansion. A systematic analysis of
these effects is performed at tree level in hard and hard-collinear

because we work with the on-shell matrix elements they produce. All n-point
matrix elements of an independent SUSY invariant operator of the form D^{2k}
R^n +... must be local and satisfy SUSY Ward identities. These are strong
constraints, and we test directly whether or not matrix elements with these
properties can be constructed. If not, then the operator does not have a
supersymmetrization, and it is excluded as a potential counterterm. For n>4, we
find that R^n, D^2 R^n, D^4 R^n, and D^6 R^n are excluded as counterterms of
MHV amplitudes, while only R^n and D^2 R^n are excluded at the NMHV level. As a
consequence, for loop order L<7, there are no independent D^{2k}R^n
counterterms with n>4. If an operator is not ruled out, our method constructs
an explicit superamplitude for its matrix elements. This is done for the 7-loop
D^4 R^6 operator at the NMHV level and in other cases. We also initiate the
study of counterterms without leading pure-graviton matrix elements, which can
occur beyond the MHV level. The landscape of excluded/allowed candidate

examined using a first-quantization formalism. We show that a tunneling
transducer enforces the Heisenberg uncertainty principle for the position and
momentum of a test mass monitored by the transducer through the presence of two
sources of noise: the shot noise of the tunneling current and the momentum
fluctuations transferred by the tunneling electrons to the test mass. We
analyze a number of cases including symmetric and asymmetric rectangular
potential barriers and a barrier in which there is a constant electric field.
Practical configurations for reaching the quantum limit in measurements of the
position of macroscopic bodies with such a class of transducers are studied.

T0 decreases with decreasing x and disappears at x~0.45. T0 of CeRu2Al10 is
suppressed down to 26 K under H=14.5 T along the a-axis. These results clearly
indicate that the transition has a magnetic origin and is ascribed to the
interaction between Ce ions. Considering the results of specific heat, magnetic

between Ce ions. Although its properties in a Ce dilute region is basically
understood by the impurity Kondo effect, CeRu2Al10 shows a
Kondo-semiconductor-like behavior. The phase transition at T0 may be
characterized as a new type of phase transition that appears during the
crossover from the dilute Kondo to the Kondo semiconductor.

perturbations on small scales. Finally, we discuss Kadota-Stewart model. This
model gives an example in which we have to choose rather unnatural initial

Liouville theorem, valid for N-dimensional approximations of the dynamics, we
define the microcanonical measure as a limit measure where N goes to infinity.
When only the energy and enstrophy invariants are taken into account, we give
an explicit computation to prove the following result: the microcanonical
measure is actually a Young measure corresponding to the maximization of a
mean-field entropy. We explain why this result remains true for more general
microcanonical measures, when all the dynamical invariants are taken into

invariant measures for the dynamics of the 2D Euler equations. We describe a
more general set of invariant measures, and discuss briefly their stability and
their consequence for the ergodicity of the 2D Euler equations. The extension
of these results to the Vlasov equations is also discussed, together with a
proof of the uniqueness of statistical equilibria, for Vlasov equations with
repulsive convex potentials. Even if we consider, in this paper, invariant
measures only for Hamiltonian equations, with no fluxes of conserved
quantities, we think this work is an important step towards the description of
non-equilibrium invariant measures with fluxes.

possible for future instruments (e.g. SKA and ASKAP). However, mapping of the

ambiguities of our model parameters, as well as to the weak response of the RM

wavelength Spitzer IRAC bands, reaching to visual extinctions of ~100 mag and
column densities of 9x10^22 cm^-2. From this we compiled a new sample of cold

dense clumps within them. The latter were followed up by pointed ammonia
observations with the 100m Effelsberg telescope, to determine rotational
temperatures and kinematic distances. Extinction maps of the Galactic plane
trace large scale structures such as the spiral arms. The 1.2 mm emission maps
reveal that the high extinction clouds contain extended cold dust emission,
from filamentary structures to still diffuse clouds. Most of the clouds are
dark in 24 microns, but several show already signs of star formation via maser
emission or bright infrared sources, suggesting that the high extinction clouds
contain a variety of evolutionary stages. The observations suggest an
evolutionary scheme from dark, cold and diffuse clouds, to clouds with a
stronger 1.2 mm peak and to finally clouds with many strong 1.2 mm peaks, which
are also warmer, more turbulent and already have some star formation signposts.

photospheric pulsations was present amongst both the hot and cool stellar

determine the physical origin of the wind structure inferred for the OB
supergiants, although the inhomogineities in the winds of the Wolf Rayets are
likely driven by binary interactions and, conversely, by pulsations in at least
one of the cool hypergiants. Photospheric pulsations were found for stars
ranging from spectral types as early as O9 I through to the mid F Ia+ yellow
hypergiants - with a possible dependence on the luminosity class amongst the OB
stars. The spectroscopically variable red supergiants (M2-5 Ia) are also
potential pulsators but require further observations to confirm this
hypothesis. Determination of the amplitude and periodicity of these pulsations
as a function of temperature, luminosity and evolutionary state holds open the
prospect of identifying the physical mechanisms driving the instabilities that

constraining both their interior rotation profile and their convective core
overshoot. In particular, a recent study focusing on theta$ Oph has shown that
a convective core overshoot parameter of alpha = 0.44 is required to model the
observed pulsation frequencies, significantly higher than for other stars of
this type. We investigate the effects of rotation and overshoot in early type
main sequence pulsators, and attempt to use the low order pulsation frequencies
to constrain these parameters. This will be applied to a few test models and
theta Oph. We use a 2D stellar evolution code and a 2D linear adiabatic
pulsation code to calculate pulsation frequencies for 9.5 Msun models. We
calculate low order p-modes for models with a range of rotation rates and
convective core overshoot parameters. Using these models, we find that the
convective core overshoot has a larger effect on the pulsation frequencies than
the rotation, except in the most rapidly rotating models considered. When the
differences in radii are accounted for by scaling the frequencies, the effects
of rotation diminish, but are not entirely accounted for. We find that
increasing the convective core overshoot decreases the large separation, while
producing a slight increase in the small separations. We created a model
frequency grid which spanned several rotation rates and convective core
overshoot values. Using a modified chi^2 statistic, we are able to recover the
rotation velocity and core overshoot for a few test models. Finally, we discuss
the case of the beta Cephei star theta Oph. Using the observed frequencies and
a fixed mass and metallicity, we find a lower overshoot than previously
determined, with alpha = 0.28 +/- 0.05. Our determination of the rotation rate
agrees well with both previous work and observations, around 30 km/s.

numerical resolutions of the pulsational equations must be followed. In
particular, we have verified the numerical accuracy obtained with the Saclay
seismic model, which is used to study the solar g-mode region (60 to
140$\mu$Hz). We have compared the results coming from the Aarhus adiabatic
pulsation code (ADIPLS), with the frequencies computed with the Granada Code
(GraCo) taking into account several possible choices. We have concluded that
the present equilibrium models and the use of the Richardson extrapolation
ensure an accuracy of the order of $0.01 \mu Hz$ in the determination of the
frequencies, which is quite enough for our purposes.

of sunspots allows us to gain insights on the energy transport in strong
magnetic fields and, thus, on the processes inside the convection zone, where
solar magnetic fields are generated and amplified before emerging at the

results of a spectropolarimetric analysis of a sunspot observed during the
declining phase of the solar cycle 23. By inversion of full Stokes spectra
observed in several spectral regions in the optical at the THEMIS facility we
infer the height dependence of physical quantities such as the temperature and
the magnetic field strength for different sunspot regions. The simultaneous use
of atomic (Fe{\sc i} 5250.2 and 5250.6 \AA) and highly temperature sensitive

the strongly supercritical simulations the CFE is ~33 % per free-fall time of
the cloud tff,cl, whereas in the mildly supercritical simulations this value
goes down to ~6%/tff,cl. A comparison of the intrinsic specific angular

using synthetic 2D velocity maps of the cores,shows that the synthetic
observations tend to overestimate the true value of j by a factor of ~10.The
origin of this discrepancy lies in the fact that contrary to the intrinsic
determination which sums up the individual gas parcels contributions to j, the
determination of j using the observational procedure which is based on a
measurement on the global velocity gradient under the hypothesis of uniform
rotation smoothes out the complex fluctuations present in the 3D velocity
field. Our results provide a natural explanation for the discrepancy by a
factor ~10 observed between the intrinsic 3D distributions of j and the

measurements of j which are based on the measurement of the observed global

a more accurate estimate of j in the cores.

the fact that SN Ia luminosities depend on their light-curve shapes and
colours. Using Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) and other data, we show that
there is an additional dependence on the global characteristics of their host
galaxies: events of the same light-curve shape and colour are, on average,
0.08mag (~4.0sigma) brighter in massive host galaxies (presumably metal-rich)
and galaxies with low specific star-formation rates (sSFR). SNe Ia in galaxies
with a low sSFR also have a smaller slope (""beta"") between their luminosities
and colours with ~2.7sigma significance, and a smaller scatter on SN Ia Hubble
diagrams (at 95% confidence), though the significance of these effects is
dependent on the reddest SNe. SN Ia colours are similar between low-mass and
high-mass hosts, leading us to interpret their luminosity differences as an
intrinsic property of the SNe and not of some external factor such as dust. If
the host stellar mass is interpreted as a metallicity indicator, the luminosity
trends are in qualitative agreement with theoretical predictions. We show that
the average stellar mass, and therefore the average metallicity, of our SN Ia
host galaxies decreases with redshift. The SN Ia luminosity differences
consequently introduce a systematic error in cosmological analyses, comparable
to the current statistical uncertainties on parameters such as w. We show that
the use of two SN Ia absolute magnitudes, one for events in high-mass
(metal-rich) galaxies, and one for events in low-mass (metal-poor) galaxies,
adequately corrects for the differences. Cosmological fits incorporating these
terms give a significant reduction in chi^2 (3.8-4.5sigma). We conclude that
future SN Ia cosmological analyses should use a correction of this (or similar)
form to control demographic shifts in the galaxy population.

interesting target for asteroseismic studies. In particular, this work is
devoted to the determination of the internal metallicity of this star, linked
with its $\lambda$ Bootis nature, and its age, taking the advantage of its
$\gamma$ Doradus-type pulsations. To do so we have used the equilibrium code
CESAM and the non-adiabatic pulsational code GraCo. We have applied the
Frequency Ratio Method and the Time Dependent Convection theory to estimate the
mode identification, the Brunt-Va\""is\""al\""a frequency integral and the mode
instability, making a selection of the possible models fulfilling all
observational constraints. Using the position of the star in the HR diagram,
the solar metallicity models is discarded. This result contradicts one of the
main assumptions of the most accepted hypothesis explaining the $\lambda$
Bootis nature, the accretion/diffusion of gas from a star with solar
metallicity. Therefore, in sight of these new results, a revision of this
hypothesis is needed. The inclusion of accurate internal chemical mixing is
necessary. The use of the asteroseismological constraints provides a very
accurate determination of the physical characteristics of HR\,8799: an age in
the ranges [1123, 1625] and [26, 430] Myr, and a mass in the ranges [1.32,
1.33] and [1.44, 1.45] $M_{\odot}$, respectively, depending on the visual angle
$i$. The determination of this angle and more accurate multicolor photometric
observations can definitively fix the mass, metallicity and age of this star.
In particular, an accurate age estimation is needed for a correct understanding
of the planetary system. In our study we have found that the age widely used
for modelling the system is unlike.

superconductors have potential for generation of terahertz electromagnetic
waves. When the thickness of a superconductor sample is much smaller than the
wavelength of electromagnetic waves in vacuum, the superconductor renders
itself as a cavity. Unlike conventional lasers, the presence of the cavity does
not guarantee a coherent emission because of the internal degree of freedom of
the superconductivity phase in long junctions. We study the excitation of
terahertz wave by solitons in a stack of intrinsic Josephson junctions,
especially for relatively short junctions. Coherent emission requires a
rectangular configuration of solitons. However such a configuration is unstable
against weak fluctuations, contrarily solitons favor a triangular lattice
corresponding to an out phase oscillation of electromagnetic waves. To utilize
the cavity, we propose to use an array of stacks of short intrinsic Josephson
junctions to generate powerful terahertz electromagnetic waves. The cavity
synchronizes the plasma oscillation in different stacks and the emission
intensity is predicted to be proportional to the number of stacks squared.

including the flavour coupling at the N_2-decay stage as well as at the stage
of washout by the lightest right-handed neutrino N_1. Moreover, we point out
that in general part of the electron and muon asymmetries (phantom terms), can
completely escape the wash-out at the production and a total B-L asymmetry can
be generated by the lightest RH neutrino wash-out yielding so called phantom
leptogenesis. However, the phantom terms are proportional to the initial N_2
abundance and in particular they vanish for initial zero N_2-abundance. Taking
any of these new effects into account can significantly modify the final

The analysis of the intensity dependence on the crystal orientation with

term proportional to $\ln N$. Furthermore, we discover that the mere existence
of a knot requires a well defined entropic cost that scales exponentially with
its minimal length. In the case of polygons with composite knots it turns out
that the partition function can be simply factorized in terms that depend only
on prime components with an additional combinatorial factor that takes into
account the statistical property that by interchanging two identical prime knot

remains unaltered. Finally, the above results allow to conjecture a sequence of

contacts form by spontaneous alloying, which occurs already at room
temperature. The alloyed phase penetrates deeply into PbTe and forms metallic
contacts even in the presence of depletion layers at the semiconductor surface.
Although the detailed structure of this phase is unknown, we observe that it
exhibits a superconducting transition at temperatures below 10 K. This causes
such substantial reduction of the contact resistances that they even become
comparable to those predicted for ideal superconductor-normal conductor
contacts. Most importantly, this result indicates that the interface phase in
the superconducting state becomes nearly homogeneous - in contrast to the
structure expected for alloyed contacts. We suggest that the unusual interface
superconductivity is linked to the unique properties of PbTe, namely, its huge
static dielectric constant. Apparently the alloyed interface phase contains
superconducting precipitates randomly distributed within the depletion layers,
and their Coulomb charging energies are extremely small. According to the
existing models of the granular superconductivity, even very weak Josephson
coupling between the neighboring precipitates gives rise to the formation of a
global superconducting phase which explains our observations.

vanishing for pure states which has not in general a closed form in terms of C,

increasing interest in multidimensional analysis. However, flow cytometers are
limited in the number of markers they can jointly observe, which is typically a
fraction of the number of markers of interest. For this reason, practitioners
often perform multiple assays based on different, overlapping combinations of
markers. In this paper, we address the challenge of imputing the high
dimensional jointly distributed values of marker attributes based on
overlapping marginal observations. We show that simple nearest neighbor based
imputation can lead to spurious subpopulations in the imputed data, and
introduce an alternative approach based on nearest neighbor imputation
restricted to a cell's subpopulation. This requires us to perform clustering
with missing data, which we address with a mixture model approach and novel EM

techniques to initialize the EM algorithm using domain knowledge. We
demonstrate our approach on real flow cytometry data.

molecular emission line filaments. We argue that these are the result of {\em
local} thermal instability in a {\em globally} stable galaxy cluster core. We
present local, high resolution, two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations
of thermal instability for conditions appropriate to the intracluster medium
(ICM); the simulations include thermal conduction along magnetic field lines
and adiabatic cosmic rays. Thermal conduction suppresses thermal instability
along magnetic field lines on scales smaller than the Field length ($\gtrsim$10
kpc for the hot, diffuse ICM). We show that the Field length in the cold medium
must be resolved both along and perpendicular to the magnetic field in order to
obtain numerically converged results. Because of negligible conduction
perpendicular to the magnetic field, thermal instability leads to fine scale
structure in the perpendicular direction. Filaments of cold gas along magnetic
field lines are thus a natural consequence of thermal instability with
anisotropic thermal conduction. Nonlinearly, filaments of cold ($\sim 10^4$ K)
gas should have lengths (along the magnetic field) comparable to the Field
length in the cold medium $\sim 10^{-4}$ pc! Observations show, however, that
the atomic filaments in clusters are far more extended, $\sim 10$ kpc. Cosmic
ray pressure support (or a small scale turbulent magnetic pressure) may resolve
this discrepancy: even a small cosmic ray pressure in the diffuse ICM, $\sim
10^{-4}$ of the thermal pressure, can be adiabatically compressed to provide
significant pressure support in cold filaments. This is qualitatively
consistent with the large population of cosmic rays invoked to explain the

Whereas
quantization of the magnetic flux with hc/2e prevails in sufficiently thick
loops with current free interior, the supercurrent in narrow loops is either
hc/2e or hc/e periodic with the external magnetic flux. The periodicity depends
on the properties of the condensate state, in particular on the Doppler shift
of the energy spectrum. For an s-wave superconductor in a loop with diameter
larger than the coherence length, the Doppler shift is small with respect to
the energy gap, and the hc/2e periodic behavior of its flux dependent
thermodynamic properties is maintained. However, for smaller s-wave loops and,
more prominently, narrow d-wave loops of any diameter R, the Doppler shift has
a strong effect on the supercurrent carrying state; as a consequence, the
fundamental flux periodicity is in fact hc/e. It is shown analytically and
numerically that the hc/e periodic component in the supercurrent decays only
algebraically as 1/R for large d-wave loops. For nodal superconductors the
discrete nature of the eigenergies close to the Fermi energy has to be
respected in the evaluation of the Doppler shift. Furthermore, we investigate,
whether the Doppler shift modifies the supercurrent through Josephson junctions
with d-wave superconductors. For transparent junctions, the Josephson current
behaves similar to the persistent supercurrent in a loop. These distinct
physical phenomena can be compared, if the magnetic flux in units of hc/e is
identified with the phase variation of the order parameter divided by 4 pi.
