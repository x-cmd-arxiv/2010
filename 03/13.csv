cover different morphological structures of the central parts of three bright
Galactic HII regions: M8, M17 and NGC7635. We study the spatial distributions
of a large number of nebular parameters such as the extinction coefficient,
line fluxes, physical conditions and ionic abundances at the maximum spatial
resolution attainable with our instrumentation. Particularly, our goal is to
study the behaviour of the abundance discrepancy factor of O^{2+}, ADF(O^{2+}),
defined as the logarithmic difference of the O^{2+} abundances derived from
collisionally excited and recombination lines. We find that the ADF(O^{2+})
remains fairly constant along the slit positions of M8 and M17. In the case of
NGC7635, we only detect the OII recombination lines in the integrated spectrum
along the whole slit, where the ADF(O^{2+}) reaches a remarkably high value of
about 0.59 dex. We compare our results with previous ones obtained for the
Orion Nebula. We find several evidences that suggest the presence of a
candidate to Herbig-Haro object in M8.

substantial increase in the SU(3)_C X SU(2)_L unified coupling. We find the
conjunction of these models with the F-resh analysis employed to be
comparatively F-ast proton decay, only narrowly evading existing detection

different distribution from that in GR, where we can also see the deviation

find that extended surface states can hybridize with the $e$-levels of Co and
efficiently mediate the magnetic order, although such a mechanism is effective
only for ions placed in the first few atomic planes near the surface. We also
find that the magnetic anisotropy changes at the surface from an hard-axis
easy-plane to an easy axis, with an associated increase of its magnitude. We
then conclude that clusters with high densities of surfacial Co ions may
display blocking temperatures much higher than in the bulk.

correlation for 99 quasars between optical nuclear luminosities and total radio
(VLBA) luminosities of unresolved cores at 15 GHz originated at milliarcseconds
scales. For 18 BL Lacs, the optical continuum emission correlates with the
radio emission of the jet at 15 GHz. We suggest that the radio and optical
emission are beamed and originate in the innermost part of the
sub--parsec-scale jet in quasars. Analysis of the relation between the apparent
speed of the jet and the optical nuclear luminosity at 5100 AA supports the
relativistic beaming model for the optical emission generated in the jet, and
allows the peak values of the intrinsic optical luminosity of the jet and its
Lorentz factor to be estimated for the populations of quasars, BL Lacs, and
radio galaxies. The radio-loudness of quasars is found to increase at high
redshifts, which can be a result of lower efficiency of the accretion in AGN
having higher radio luminosities. A strong positive correlation is found
between the intrinsic kinetic power of the jet and the apparent luminosities of
the total and the unresolved core emission of the jet at 15 GHz. This
correlation is interpreted in terms of intrinsically more luminous parsec-scale
jet producing more luminous extended structure which is detectable at low radio
frequencies, 151 MHz. A possibility that the low frequency radio emission is
relativistically beamed in superluminal AGN and therefore correlates with radio

dependencies between wave numbers of the mode and overcriticality are always
assumed in the available proofs of instability. We analyse the stability
analytically following the approach of Podvigina (2008) without making a priori
assumptions concerning asymptotic relations between small parameters
characterising the problem. Instability of rolls to short-scale modes is also
considered. Therefore, our analytical results on stability to space-periodic

are thought to be genetically related to one another as collisional fragments
from the surface of the large basaltic asteroid 4 Vesta. We investigate this
relationship by comparing the near-infrared (0.7-2.5 micron) spectra of 39
V-type asteroids to laboratory spectra of HED meteorites. The central
wavelengths and areas spanned by the 1 and 2 micron pyroxene-olivine absorption
bands that are characteristic of planetary basalts are measured for both the
asteroidal and meteoritic data. The band centers are shown to be well
correlated, however the ratio of areas spanned by the 1 and 2 micron absorption
bands are much larger for the asteroids than for the meteorites. We argue that
this offset in band area ratio is consistent with our currently limited
understanding of the effects of space weathering, however we can not rule out
the possibility that this offset is due to compositional differences. Several
other possible causes of this offset are discussed.
  Amongst these inner Main Belt asteroids we do not find evidence for
non-Vestoid mineralogies. Instead, these asteroids seem to represent a
continuum of compositions, consistent with an origin from a single
differentiated parent body. In addition, our analysis shows that V-type
asteroids with low inclinations (i < 6 degrees) tend to have band centers
slightly shifted towards long wavelengths. This may imply that more than one
collision on Vesta's surface was responsible for producing the observed
population of inner belt V-type asteroids. Finally, we offer several
predictions that can be tested when the Dawn spacecraft enters into orbit
around Vesta in the summer of 2011.

This property is shown explicitly on three different stochastic models, where
observable-dependence of the fluctuation-dissipation temperature arises only
when the uniformity of the phase-space distribution is broken. The first model
is an energy transport model on a ring, with biased local transfer rules. In
the second model, defined on a fully connected geometry, energy is exchanged
with two heat baths at different temperatures, breaking the uniformity of the
phase-space distribution. Finally, in the last model, the system is connected
to a zero temperature reservoir, and preserves the uniformity of the
phase-space distribution in the relaxation regime, leading to an
observable-independent temperature.

open cluster, NGC 6253, have been obtained with the HYDRA multi-object
spectrograph. Based upon radial-velocity measurements alone, 47 stars at the
turnoff of the cluster color-magnitude diagram (CMD) and 18 giants are
identified as potential members. Five turnoff stars exhibit evidence of
binarity while proper-motion data eliminates two of the dwarfs as members. The
mean cluster radial velocity from probable single-star members is -29.4 +/- 1.3
km/sec (sd). A discussion of the current estimates for the cluster reddening,
derived independently of potential issues with the BV cluster photometry, lead
to an adopted reddening of E(B-V) = 0.22 +/- 0.04. From equivalent width
analyses of 38 probable single-star members near the CMD turnoff, the weighted
average abundances are found to be [Fe/H] = +0.43 +/- 0.01, [Ni/H] = +0.53 +/-
0.02 and [Si/H] = +0.43 (+0.03,-0.04), where the errors refer to the standard
errors of the weighted mean. Weak evidence is found for a possible decline in
metallicity with increasing luminosity among stars at the turnoff. We discuss
the possibility that our turnoff stars have been affected by microscopic
diffusion. For 15 probable single-star members among the giants, spectrum
synthesis leads to abundances of +0.46 (+0.02,-0.03) for [Fe/H]. While less
than half the age of NGC 6791, NGC 6253 is at least as metal-rich and, within
the uncertainties, exhibits the same general abundance pattern as that typified
by super-metal-rich dwarfs of the galactic bulge.

essential distortions of image texture and degradation of the resolution at
image reconstruction in single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT)

fragmentation. Fragments with initial masses of 5.5 M_jup, 7.4 M_jup and 12

truncation and mass profile steeping by tides, accretion of high specific

approach which allows to define the strength of participation of a subsystem in
a single synchronization cluster. The second method is based on an eigenvalue
decomposition from which a participation index is derived that characterizes
the degree of involvement of a subsystem within multiple synchronization
clusters. Simulating multiple clusters within a lattice of coupled Lorenz
oscillators we explore the limitations and pitfalls of both methods and
demonstrate (a) that the mean field approach is relatively robust even in
configurations where the single cluster assumption is not entirely fulfilled,

simulated clusters even for low coupling strengths. Using the eigenvalue
decomposition approach we studied spatiotemporal synchronization clusters in
long-lasting multichannel EEG recordings from epilepsy patients and obtained
results that fully confirm findings from well established neurophysiological

as a system of coupled oscillators. Nevertheless, this description requires the
knowledge of the elastic coupling constant between the prongs of the tuning
fork, which has not yet been measured. Therefore tuning forks have been usually
described within the single oscillator or the weakly coupled oscillators
approximation that neglects the coupling between the prongs. We propose three
different procedures to measure the elastic coupling constant: an
opto-mechanical method, a variation of the Cleveland method and a thermal noise
based method. We find that the coupling between the quartz tuning fork prongs
has a strong influence on the dynamics and the measured motion is in remarkable
agreement with a simple model of coupled harmonic oscillators. The precise
determination of the elastic coupling between the prongs of a tuning fork

understanding the dynamics of interacting particles in the presence of
disorder. Here, we address this problem for interacting bosons near $T=0$, a
situation that has been realized in trapped atomic experiments with an optical
speckle disorder. We develop a theoretical model for understanding the
hydrodynamic transport of \emph{finite-size} Bose-Einstein condensates through
disorder potentials. The goal has been to set up a simple model that will
retain all the richness of the system, yet provide analytic expressions,
allowing deeper insight into the physical mechanism. Comparison of our
theoretical predictions with the experimental data on large-amplitude dipole
oscillations of a condensate in an optical-speckle disorder shows striking
agreement. We are able to quantify various dissipative regimes of slow and fast
damping. Our calculations provide a clear evidence of reduction in disorder
strength due to interactions. The analytic treatment presented here allows us
to predict the power law governing the interaction dependance of damping. The
corresponding exponents are found to depend sensitively on the dimensionality
and are in excellent agreement with experimental observations. Thus, the
adeptness of our model, to correctly capture the essential physics of
dissipation in such transport experiments, is established.

enforcement of regularized versions of the gravitational constraint operators

the attractive forces. Recently, the repulsive hard core of a nucleon-nucleon
potential was obtained in the Sakai-Sugimoto model, and we show that a
generalized version of that model -- with an asymmetric configuration of the
flavor D8 branes -- also has an attractive potential. While the repulsive
potential stems from the Chern-Simons interactions of the U(2) flavor gauge
fields in 5D, the attractive potential is due to a coupling of the gauge fields
to a scalar field describing fluctuations of the flavor branes' geometry. At
intermediate distances r between baryons -- smaller than R_KK=O(1)/M_{omega
meson} but larger than the radius rho=R_KK/sqrt('t Hooft coupling) of the
instanton at the core of a baryon -- both the attractive and the repulsive
potentials behave as 1/r^2, but the attractive potential is weaker: Depending
on the geometry of the flavor D8 branes, the ratio C=-V_attr/V_rep ranges from
0 to 1/9. The 5D scalar fields also affect the isovector tensor and spin-spin
forces, and the overall effect is similar to the isoscalar central forces:
V(r)->(1-C)*V(r).
  At longer ranges $r\gtrsim R_{\rm KK}$, we find that the attractive potential
decays faster than the repulsive potential, so the net potential is always
repulsive. This unrealistic behavior may be peculiar to the Sakai-Sugimoto-like
models, or it could be a general problem of the large N_c limit inherent in
holography.

transitional between the blue, active population and the red, evolved galaxies
that dominate the cluster core. We stack to determine the mean submillimetre
emission from all cluster members, which is determined to be 16.6+/-2.5,
6.1+/-1.9, and 1.5+/-1.3 mJy at 250, 350, and 500 um, respectively. Stacking
analyses of the submillimetre emission of cluster members reveal trends in the
mean far-infrared luminosity with respect to cluster-centric radius and Ks-band
magnitude. We find that a large fraction of submillimetre emission comes from
the boundary of the inner, virialized region of the cluster, at cluster-centric
distances around R_500. Stacking also shows that the bulk of the submillimetre
emission arises in intermediate-mass galaxies (L<L*), with Ks magnitude ~1 mag
fainter than the giant ellipticals. The results and constraints obtained in
this work will provide a useful reference for the forthcoming surveys to be
conducted on galaxy clusters by Herschel.

photometric study of the galaxy population of MACS J0025.4$-$1225 (z=0.586), a
major cluster merger with clear segregation of dark and luminous matter, to
examine the impact of mergers on galaxy evolution. Based on 436 galaxy spectra
obtained with Keck DEIMOS, we identified 212 cluster members within 4 Mpc of
the cluster centre, and classified them using three spectroscopic types; we
find 111 absorption-line, 90 emission-line (including 23 e(a) and 11 e(b)), and
6 E+A galaxies. The fraction of absorption(emission)-line galaxies is a
monotonically increasing(decreasing) function of both projected galaxy density
and radial distance to the cluster center. More importantly, the 6 observed E+A
cluster members are all located between the dark-matter peaks of the cluster
and within ~0.3Mpc radius of the X-ray flux peak, unlike the E+A galaxies in
other intermediate-redshift clusters which are usually found to avoid the core
region. In addition, we use Hubble Space Telescope imaging to classify cluster
members according to morphological type. We find the global fraction of spiral
and lenticular galaxies in MACS J0025 to be among the highest observed to date
in clusters at z>0.5. The observed E+A galaxies are found to be of lenticular
type with Sersic indices of ~2, boosting the local fraction of S0 to 70 per
cent between the dark-matter peaks. Combing the results of our analysis of the
spatial distribution, morphology, and spectroscopic features of the galaxy
population, we propose that the starburst phase of these E+A galaxies was both
initiated and terminated during the first core-passage about 0.5--1Gyr ago, and
that their morphology has already been transformed into S0 due to ram pressure
and/or tidal forces near the cluster core. By contrast, ongoing starbursts are
observed predominantly in infalling galaxies, and thus appears to be unrelated
to the cluster merger.

near-infrared colour-colour diagrams. Here we combine deep JHK photometry with
J- and K-band lightcurves, obtained with UKIRT/WFCAM, to explore the YSO
population in the dark cloud IC1396W. We demonstrate that a colour-variability
criterion can provide useful constraints on the star forming activity in

alone vastly overestimates the number of YSOs. In total, the globule probably
harbours not more than ten YSOs, among them a system of two young stars
embedded in a small (~10000 AU) reflection nebula. This translates into a star
forming efficiency SFE of ~1%, which is low compared with nearby more massive
star forming regions, but similar to less massive globules. We confirm that
IC1396W is likely associated with the IC1396 HII region. One possible
explanation for the low SFE is the relatively large distance to the ionizing
O-star in the central part of IC1396. Serendipitously, our variability campaign
yields two new eclipsing binaries, and eight periodic variables, most of them

microwave foreground as electric dipole radiation from spinning dust grains as
proposed by Draine and Lazarian (1998ab). In this paper we present a refinement
of the original model by improving the treatment of a number of physical
effects. First, we consider a disk-like grain rotating with angular velocity at
an arbitrary angle with respect to the grain symmetry axis and derive the
rotational damping and excitation coefficients arising from infrared emission,
plasma-grain interactions and electric dipole emission. The angular velocity
distribution and the electric dipole emission spectrum for grains is calculated
using the Langevin equation, for cases both with and without fast internal
relaxation. Our results show that, the peak emissivity of spinning dust,
compared to earlier studies, increases by a factor of ~2 for the Warm Neutral
Medium (WNM), the Warm Ionized Medium (WIM), the Cold Neutral Medium (CNM) and
the Photodissociation Region (PDR), and by a factor ~4 for Reflection Nebulae
(RN). The frequency at the emission peak also increases by factors ~1.4 to ~2
for these media. The increased emission and peak frequency result from the
non-sphericity of grain shape and from the anisotropy in damping and excitation
along directions parallel and perpendicular to the grain symmetry axis. Second,
we provide a detailed numerical study including transient spin-up of grains by
single-ion collisions. The impulses broaden the emission spectrum and increase
the peak emissivity for the CNM, WNM and WIM. In addition, we present an
improved treatment of rotational excitation and damping by infrared emission.

from galaxies (rest-frame wavelengths ~60--200um), primarily produced by dust
heated through absorption in star-forming clouds. However, identifying

individual sources that produce significant emission in the BLAST bands. We
characterize the temperatures and FIR luminosities for a subset of 69 sources

an unknown regression function using linear combinations of a suitable set of
covariates. One of the key assumptions for the success of any statistical
procedure in this setup is to assume that the linear combination is sparse in
some sense, for example, that it involves only few covariates. We consider a
general, non necessarily linear, regression with Gaussian noise and study a
related question that is to find a linear combination of approximating
functions, which is at the same time sparse and has small mean squared error
(MSE). We introduce a new estimation procedure, called Exponential Screening
that shows remarkable adaptation properties. It adapts to the linear
combination that optimally balances MSE and sparsity, whether the latter is
measured in terms of the number of non-zero entries in the combination
($\ell_0$ norm) or in terms of the global weight of the combination ($\ell_1$
norm). The power of this adaptation result is illustrated by showing that
Exponential Screening solves optimally and simultaneously all the problems of
aggregation in Gaussian regression that have been discussed in the literature.
Moreover, we show that the performance of the Exponential Screening estimator
cannot be improved in a minimax sense, even if the optimal sparsity is known in
advance. The theoretical and numerical superiority of Exponential Screening
compared to state-of-the-art sparse procedures is also discussed.

topology for all time. Although ionized astrophysical objects, like stars and
galactic disks, are almost perfectly conducting, they show indications of
changes in topology, `magnetic reconnection', on dynamical time scales.
Reconnection can be observed directly in the solar corona, but can also be
inferred from the existence of large scale dynamo activity inside stellar
interiors. Solar flares and gamma ray busts are usually associated with
magnetic reconnection. Previous work has concentrated on showing how
reconnection can be rapid in plasmas with very small collision rates. Here we
present numerical evidence, based on three dimensional simulations, that
reconnection in a turbulent fluid occurs at a speed comparable to the rms
velocity of the turbulence, regardless of the value of the resistivity. In
particular, this is true for turbulent pressures much weaker than the magnetic
field pressure so that the magnetic field lines are only slightly bent by the
turbulence. These results are consistent with the proposal by Lazarian and
Vishniac (1999) that reconnection is controlled by the stochastic diffusion of
magnetic field lines, which produces a broad outflow of plasma from the
reconnection zone. This work implies that reconnection in a turbulent fluid
typically takes place in approximately a single eddy turnover time, with broad
implications for dynamo activity and particle acceleration throughout the
universe. In contrast, the reconnection in 2D configurations in the presence of
turbulence depends on resistivity, i.e. is slow.

evolution of WD + RG systems. We found that some donor stars at the time of the
supernova explosion contain little hydrogen-rich material on top of the helium
core (as low as 0.017 $M_{\odot}$), which is smaller than the upper limit to
the amount derived from observations of material stripped-off by explosion
ejecta. Thus, no hydrogen line is expected in the nebular spectra of these SN
Ia. We also derive the distributions of the envelope mass and the core mass of
the companions from WD + RG channel at the moment of a supernova explosion by
adopting a binary population synthesis approach. We rarely find a RG companion
with a very low-mass envelope. Furthermore, our models imply that the remnant
of the WD + RG channel emerging after the supernova explosion is a single
low-mass white dwarf (0.15 $M_{\odot}$ - 0.30 $M_{\odot}$). The absence of a
hydrogen line in nebular spectra of SNe Ia provides support to the proposal
that the WD + RG system is the progenitor of SNe Ia.

of evidence for studying dynamics of individual and group behavior, the
structure of networks and global patterns of the flow of information on them.
However, in most previous studies, the structure of the underlying networks was
not directly visible but had to be inferred from the flow of information from
one individual to another. As a result, we do not yet understand dynamics of
information spread on networks or how the structure of the network affects it.
We address this gap by analyzing data from two popular social news sites.
Specifically, we extract social networks of active users on Digg and Twitter,

$\mathrm{YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+\delta}}$, corresponding to approximately 10%
doping, which contain $\mathrm{CuO}$ bilayers in the unit cell. These unit
cells are further coupled along the c-axis by a tunneling matrix element. A
model of the energy dispersion that has its roots in the previously determined
electronic structure, combined with two-fold commensurate density waves,
reveals multiple electron and hole pockets. To the extent that quasiparticles
of the reconstructed Fermi surface have finite residues, however small, the
formation of Landau levels are the cause of these oscillations and the bilayer
splitting and warping of the electronic dispersion along the direction
perpendicular to the CuO-planes are firm consequences. We explore this
possibility in detail and find overall consistency with experiments. An
important conclusion is that bilayer splitting is severely renormalized from
the value obtained from band structure calculations. It would be extremely
interesting to perform these experiments for higher values of doping. We
roughly expect the splitting of the frequencies to increase with doping, but
the full picture may be more complex because the density wave order parameter
is also expected to decrease with doping, vanishing around the middle of the
superconducting dome.

  Redefined",,,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In light of the transformation defined in the current quantum field theory,
electromagnetic interaction is unchanged under time reversal. However, this
kind of time reversal only lets in the Hamiltonian of the coordinate space,
without considering that the creation and annihilation processes of particles
should also be reversed when the concrete problems are calculated in momentum
space. In fact, according to the current transformation of quantum field
theory, creation operator of spinor particle is still creation operator and
annihilation operator is also still annihilation operator. This result does not
represent the real meaning of time reversal. In the interaction process, a
particle's creation operator should become the annihilation operator and its
annihilation operator should become the creation operator after time reversal.
It is proved that when the reversion of creation and annihilation processes is
considered in momentum space, under the condition of high energy, a great
symmetry violation of time reversal would be caused in some low order processes
of electromagnetic interaction just as the Compton scattering in which the
propagation lines of fermions are contained. This result contradicts with the
experiments of particle physics and is impossible. Meanwhile, it is proved that
the normalization processes of the third order vertex angles of electromagnetic
interaction also violate time reversal symmetry, no matter in the coordinate
space or in the momentum space. But the symmetry violation is small with a
magnitude order about 10(-5). The similar problems exist in the current C
transformation of quantum field theory. The C transformation of creation and
annihilation operator can not be consistent with the C transformation of spinor
particle's wave functions in momentum space. We can obtain the correct C
transformation of creation and annihilation operator, but can not obtain the
correct C transformation of wave functions in momentum space. Therefore, the
current rules of C,T transformations in quantum field theory has serious defect
and should be redefined.

characterization of interaction potentials between molecules and the modeling
of reactive scattering mechanism. Here, we report on the {\it abinitio}
calculation of isotropic and anisotropic van der Waals interaction potentials
for polar KRb and RbCs colliding with each other or with ultracold atoms. Based
on these potentials and two short-range scattering parameters we then develop a
single-channel scattering model with flexible boundary conditions. Our
calculations show that at low temperatures (and in absence of an external
electric field) the reaction rates between molecules or molecules with atoms
have a resonant character as a function of the short-range parameters. We also
find that both the isotropic and anisotropic van der Waals coefficients have
significant contributions from dipole coupling to excited electronic states.
Their values can differ dramatically from those solely obtained from the
permanent dipole moment. A comparison with recently obtained reaction rates of
fermionic $^{40}$K$^{87}$Rb shows that the experimental data can not be

devised a combinatorial $O(mn)$-algorithm that finds a triangle free 2-matching
of maximum size (hereinafter $n := \abs{VG}$, $m := \abs{EG}$) and also
established a min-max theorem. We claim that this approach is, in fact,
superfluous by demonstrating how their results may be obtained directly from

well-known that every regular graph admits a perfect 2-matching. One can easily
strengthen this result and prove that every $d$-regular graph (for $d \geq 3$)
contains a perfect triangle-free 2-matching. We give the following algorithms

diagrams. A $k$-noncrossing diagram is called modular if it does not contains
any isolated arcs and any arc has length at least four. Modular diagrams
represent the deformation retracts of RNA pseudoknot structures
\cite{Stadler:99,Reidys:07pseu,Reidys:07lego} and their properties reflect
basic features of these bio-molecules. The particular case of modular
noncrossing diagrams has been extensively studied \cite{Waterman:78b,
Waterman:79,Waterman:93, Schuster:98}. Let ${\sf Q}_k(n)$ denote the number of
modular $k$-noncrossing diagrams over $n$ vertices. We derive exact enumeration
results as well as the asymptotic formula ${\sf Q}_k(n)\sim c_k
n^{-(k-1)^2-\frac{k-1}{2}}\gamma_{k}^{-n}$ for $k=3,..., 9$ and derive a new
proof of the formula ${\sf Q}_2(n)\sim 1.4848\, n^{-3/2}\,1.8489^{-n}$
\cite{Schuster:98}.

  matrices and their applications to paired comparisons",,,,,"math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Let $A$ be a real skew-symmetric Gaussian random matrix whose upper
triangular elements are independently distributed according to the standard
normal distribution. We provide the distribution of the largest singular value
$\sigma_1$ of $A$. Moreover, by acknowledging the fact that the largest
singular value can be regarded as the maximum of a Gaussian field, we deduce
the distribution of the standardized largest singular value
$\sigma_1/\sqrt{\mathrm{tr}(A'A)/2}$. These distributional results are utilized
in Scheff\'{e}'s paired comparisons model. We propose tests for the hypothesis
of subtractivity based on the largest singular value of the skew-symmetric
residual matrix. Professional baseball league data are analyzed as an
illustrative example.

number densities and electron temperature with the assumption of a
Maxwell-Boltzmann electron energy distribution. This method is based on the
availability of experimental relative emission intensities of only four argon
lines that originate from any of the 4p argon levels. The proposed model has a
relatively wide range of validity for laboratory plasmas that contain argon gas
and can be a valuable tool for the emerging field of atmospheric microplasmas,
for which diagnostics is still limited.

nonequilibrium characteristic. The effect of methane and oxygen concentrations
has also been studied, showing that gas mixtures have an important effect on
the microplasma state.

The replicated spin-glass Hamiltonian is mapped onto a Coulomb gas of
logarithmically interacting particles confined by a logarithmic single particle
potential. The precise free energy is obtained by analyzing the Painlev\'e
$\tau^{IV} [n]$ function in the $n\to 0$ limit. The large $N$ thermodynamics
exactly recovers that of Kosterlitz, Thouless and Jones \cite{ktjonesPRL}. It
is hoped that the approach here can be extended to apply to systems beyond the
spherical model, particularly those in which destabilizing terms lead to
replica symmetry breaking.

derivative for a real scalar field. The degree of freedom for the HD field can
be converted to multiple fields with canonical kinetic terms up to the overall
sign. The Lagrangian describing the dynamics of the multiple fields is known as
the Lee-Wick (LW) form. The first step to obtain the LW form for a given HD
Lagrangian is to find an auxiliary field (AF) Lagrangian which is equivalent to
the original HD Lagrangian up to the quantum level. Till now, the AF Lagrangian
has been studied only for N=2 and 3 cases, where $N$ is the number of poles of
the two-point function of the HD scalar field. We construct the AF Lagrangian
for arbitrary $N$. By the linear combinations of AF fields, we also obtain the
corresponding LW form. We find the explicit mapping matrices among the HD
fields, the AF fields, and the LW fields. As an exercise of our construction,
we calculate the relations among parameters and mapping matrices for $N=2,3$,
and 4 cases.

realistic strained graphene flakes of sizes of 100nm, we examine possible means
of exploiting this effect for practical electronics and valleytronics devices.
First, we found that elastic backscattering at rough edges leads to the
formation of well defined transport gaps of order 100meV under moderate maximum
strain of 10%. Second, the application of a real magnetic field induced a
separation, in space and energy, of the states arising from different valleys,
leading to a way of inducing bulk valley polarization which is insensitive to
short range scattering.
