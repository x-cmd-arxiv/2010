states (LDoS) in graphene at high perpendicular magnetic field. For this
purpose, we extend from the Schr\""odinger to the Dirac case a
semicoherent-state Green's-function formalism, devised to obtain in a
quantitative way the lifting of the Landau-level degeneracy in the presence of
smooth confinement and smooth disordered potentials. Our general technique,
which rigorously describes quantum-mechanical motion in a magnetic field beyond
the semi-classical guiding center picture of vanishing magnetic length (both
for the ordinary two-dimensional electron gas and graphene), is connected to
the deformation (Weyl) quantization theory in phase space developed in
mathematical physics. For generic quadratic potentials of either scalar (i.e.,
electrostatic) or mass (i.e., associated with coupling to the substrate) types,
we exactly solve the regime of large magnetic field (yet at finite magnetic
length - formally, this amounts to considering an infinite Fermi velocity)
where Landau-level mixing becomes negligible. Hence, we obtain a closed-form
expression for the graphene Green's function in this regime, providing
analytically the discrete energy spectra for both cases of scalar and mass
parabolic confinement. Furthermore, the coherent-state representation is shown
to display a hierarchy of local energy scales ordered by powers of the magnetic
length and successive spatial derivatives of the local potential, which allows
one to devise controlled approximation schemes at finite temperature for
arbitrary and possibly disordered potential landscapes. As an application, we
derive general analytical non-perturbative expressions for the LDoS, which may
serve as a good starting point for interpreting experimental studies.

then any deviation of the black-hole quadrupole moment from its Kerr value has
to be zero. We analyze in detail the properties of this quasi-Kerr spacetime

their dependence on the spin and quadrupole moment. In particular, we show that
the location of the innermost stable circular orbit and the gravitational
lensing experienced by photons are affected significantly at even modest
deviations of the quadrupole moment from the value predicted by the no-hair
theorem. We argue that observations of black-hole images, of relativistically

emission lines from strong mass loss. Most strikingly, we find that its surface
composition is hydrogen-deficient, but not carbon-rich. With mass fractions of
55% helium, 40% hydrogen, 1.3% carbon, 2% nitrogen, and 1.3% oxygen, it differs
greatly from the 30-50% of carbon which are typically seen in [WC]-type central
stars. The atmospheric mixture in PB 8 has an analogy in the WN/WC transition
type among the massive Wolf-Rayet stars. Therefore we suggest to introduce a
new spectral type [WN/WC] for CSPNe, with PB 8 as its first member. The central
star of PB 8 has a relatively low temperature of T=52kK, as expected for
central stars in their early evolutionary stages. Its surrounding nebula is
less than 3000 years old, i.e. relatively young. Existing calculations for the

do not predict the composition found in PB 8. We discuss various scenarios that

pseudo-time-dependent approximation, in which the physical conditions are held
fixed and uniform as the chemistry occurs. In this approximation, the initial
abundances chosen, which are totally atomic in nature except for molecular
hydrogen, are artificial. A more detailed approach to the chemistry of dense
cold cores should include the physical evolution during their early stages of
formation. Aims: Our major goal is to investigate the initial synthesis of
molecular ices and gas-phase molecules as cold molecular gas begins to form
behind a shock in the diffuse interstellar medium. The abundances calculated as
the conditions evolve can then be utilized as reasonable initial conditions for
a theory of the chemistry of dense cores. Methods: Hydrodynamic shock-wave
simulations of the early stages of cold core formation are used to determine
the time-dependent physical conditions for a gas-grain chemical network. We
follow the cold post-shock molecular evolution of ices and gas-phase molecules
for a range of visual extinction up to AV ~ 3, which increases with time. At
higher extinction, self-gravity becomes important. Results: As the newly
condensed gas enters its cool post-shock phase, a large amount of CO is
produced in the gas. As the CO forms, water ice is produced on grains, while
accretion of CO produces CO ice. The production of CO2 ice from CO occurs via
several surface mechanisms, while the production of CH4 ice is slowed by
gas-phase conversion of C into CO.

central black hole, whereas at low redshift it is almost independent of the
black hole mass. Thus z=6 quasars are indeed at an early evolutionary stage,
with rapid mass accretion and dust formation. The two hot-dust-free quasars are
likely to be first-generation quasars born in dust-free environments and are
too young to have formed a detectable amount of hot dust around them.

Self-Consistent Field Theory (SCFT) at both moderate, $\sigma_g = 0.25$, and
high, $\sigma_g = 1.00$, grafting densities using a bead-spring model.
Different concentrations of the free chains $0.0625 \le \phi_o \le 0.375$ are
examined. Contrary to the case of $\chi = 0$ when all species are almost
completely ejected by the polymer brush irrespective of their length $L$, for
$\chi < 0$ we find that the degree of absorption (absorbed amount) $\Gamma(L)$
undergoes a sharp crossover from weak to strong ($\approx 100%$) absorption,
discriminating between oligomers, $1\le L\le 8$, and longer chains. For a
moderately dense brush, $\sigma_g = 0.25$, the longer species, $L > 8$,
populate predominantly the deep inner part of the brush whereas in a dense
brush $\sigma_g = 1.00$ they penetrate into the ""fluffy"" tail of the dense
brush only. Gyration radius $R_g$ and end-to-end distance $R_e$ of absorbed
chains thereby scale with length $L$ as free polymers in the bulk. Using both
MC and DFT/SCFT methods for brushes of different chain length $32 \le N \le
256$, we demonstrate the existence of unique {\em critical} value of
compatibility $\chi = \chi^{c}<0$. For $\chi^{c}(\phi_o)$ the energy of free
chains attains the {\em same} value, irrespective of length $L$ whereas the
entropy of free chain displays a pronounced minimum. At $\chi^{c}$ all density
profiles of absorbing chains with different $L$ intersect at the same distance
from the grafting plane. The penetration/expulsion kinetics of free chains into
the polymer brush after an instantaneous change in their compatibility $\chi$
displays a rather rich behavior. We find three distinct regimes of penetration
kinetics of free chains regarding the length $L$: I ($1\le L\le 8$), II ($8 \le
L \le N$), and III ($L > N$), in which the time of absorption $\tau$ grows with
$L$ at a different rate. During the initial stages of penetration into the
brush one observes a power-law increase of $\Gamma \propto t^\alpha$ with power
$\alpha \propto -\ln \phi_o$ whereby penetration of the free chains into the
brush gets {\em slower} as their concentration rises.

over the decades. By transforming space and light propagation, a
three-dimensional (3D) object can be perceived as having reduced number of
dimensions, in the form of points, lines, and thin sheets, making it
""undetectable"" judging from scattered field. Although a variety of cloaking
devices have been reported at microwave and optical frequencies, the Terahertz
(THz) domain remains unexplored. Moreover, it should be noted that all the
previous experimental demonstrations are performed in a two-dimensional (2D)
waveguide configuration. Although those works represent a critical step in
validating the concept of the invisibility cloak, one would expect the cloaking
device to be realized in 3D with the ability to cloak an object of realistic
size. This requires the construction of an optically large cloaking device with
features much smaller than the wavelength. Fabricating 3D structures with
aspect ratio close to 100:1 is obviously a challenging task. Here, we report an
experimental demonstration of a 3D THz ground plane cloak. Reflection terahertz
time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) was employed to characterize the cloaking
samples. Two distinct reflection peaks can be clearly observed across a broad
frequency range, which is caused by the reflection at the surface of the bump.
The measured peak positions are consistent with the numerical simulation peak
positions. By contrast, in the spectral map of the cloak sample, the wavefront
is relatively smooth with a single peak.

course of galaxy assembly. This process does not act preferentially on smaller
mass haloes; bigger haloes \emph{always} release larger amounts of gas in a
given volume of the Universe. However, if we include multi-phase gas accretion
onto haloes, we find that only a few percent is unbound. We conclude that
either non-gravitational processes may be in play to heat up the gas in the

due to a second planet, stellar activity, or another source. Photometric
observations using the Automated Photometric Telescopes at Fairborn Observatory

wavelength range 0.9-1.7 micron. The spectrum is of remarkable quality and
shows the redshifted Balmer lines Hbeta, Hgamma, and Hdelta in absorption at
z=1.902, correcting previous erroneous redshift measurements from the
rest-frame UV. The average rest-frame equivalent width of the Balmer lines is
8+-1 Angstrom, which can be produced by a post-starburst stellar population
with a luminosity-weighted age of ~0.5 Gyr. The M/L ratio inferred from the
spectrum implies a stellar mass of ~4x10^11 Msun. We determine the morphology
of the galaxy from a deep WFC3 F160W image. Similar to other massive galaxies
at z~2 the galaxy is compact, with an effective radius of 2.1+-0.3 kpc.
Although most of the light is in a compact core, the galaxy has two red, smooth
spiral arms that appear to be tidally-induced. The spatially-resolved
spectroscopy demonstrates that the center of the galaxy is quiescent and the
surrounding disk is forming stars, as it shows Hbeta in emission. The galaxy is
interacting with a companion at a projected distance of 18 kpc, which also
shows prominent tidal features. The companion has a slightly redder spectrum
than the primary galaxy but is a factor of ~10 fainter and may have a lower
metallicity. It is tempting to interpret these observations as ""smoking gun""
evidence for the growth of compact, quiescent high redshift galaxies through
minor mergers, which has been proposed by several recent observational and
theoretical studies. Interestingly both objects host luminous AGNs, as
indicated by their X-ray luminosities, which implies that these mergers can be
accompanied by significant black hole growth. This study illustrates the power
of moderate dispersion, low background near-IR spectroscopy at HST resolution,
which is now available with the WFC3 grism.

radio galaxy 3C326N at z~0.1, which has a low star formation rate (SFR~0.07
M_sun/yr) in spite of a gas surface density similar to those in starburst
galaxies. Its star-formation efficiency is likely a factor ~20-30 lower than
those of ordinary star-forming galaxies. Combining new IRAM CO emission-line
interferometry with existing Spitzer mid-infrared spectroscopy, we find that
the luminosity ratio of CO and pure rotational H_2 line emission is factors
10-100 lower than what is usually found. This may suggest that most of the
molecular gas is warm. The Na D absorption-line profile of 3C326N in the
optical suggests an outflow with a terminal velocity of ~ -1800 km/s and a mass
outflow rate of 30-40 M_sun/yr, which cannot be explained by star formation.
The mechanical power implied by the wind, of order 10^43 erg/s, is comparable
to the bolometric luminosity of the emission lines of ionized and molecular
gas. To explain these observations, we propose a scenario where a small
fraction of the mechanical energy of the radio jet is deposited in the the
interstellar medium of 3C326N, which powers the outflow, and the line emission
through a mass momentum and energy exchange between the different phases in the
ISM. Dissipation times are of order 10^7-8 yrs, similar or greater than the
typical jet lifetime. Small ratios of CO and PAH surface brightnesses in
another 7 H_2 luminous radio galaxies suggest that a similar form of AGN
feedback could be lowering star formation efficiencies in these galxies a
similar way. The local demographics of radio-loud AGN suggests that secular gas
cooling in massive early-type galaxies of >= 10^11 M_sun could be regulated
through a fundamentally similar form of 'maintenance-phase' AGN feedback.

previous work in which the environmental dependencies of the half-light radii

studied, and a corrected mean half-light radius (corrected for the observed
environmental trends) was suggested as a reliable distance indicator. This work
both increases the sample size for the study of the environmental dependencies,
and adds leverage to the study of the corrected half-light radius as a possible
distance indicator (since Fornax lies at a larger distance than the Virgo
cluster). We study the environmental dependencies of the size of GCs using both
a Principal Component Analysis as well as 2D scaling relations. We largely
confirm the environmental dependencies shown in Jordan et al. (2005), but find
evidence that there is a residual correlation in the mean half-light radius of
GC systems with galaxy magnitude, and subtle differences in the other
correlations - so there may not be a universal correction for the half-light
radii of lower luminosity galaxy GC systems. The main factor determining the
size of a GC in an early type galaxy is the GC color. Red GCs have <r_h> =
2.8+/-0.3 pc, while blue GCs have <r_h> = 3.4+/-0.3 pc. We show that for bright
early-type galaxies (M_B < -19 mag), the uncorrected mean half-light radius of

calibrations of absolute magnitude versus CI and RPM for Hipparcos stars give
us photometric distances and 3D distribution for all the stars. Although the
selection method and uneven distribution of the XPM and UCAC3 data provide
noticeable biases the preliminary conclusions are made. The subdwarfs show some
concentration to the galactic centre hemisphere with voids because of
extinction in the Gould belt and galactic plane. Some yet unexplained
overdensities of the evolved subdwarfs are seen in several parts of the sky.
For 183 stars with radial velocities 3D motion and galactic orbits are
calculated. For 56 stars with Fe/H collected from various sources we find the

eccentricity. It is shown that most unevolved subdwarfs belong to the halo with

oscillating, localized clumps, known as oscillons. In many cases, the decay
rate of classical small amplitude oscillons is known to be exponentially
suppressed and so they are extremely long lived. In this work we compute the
decay rate of quantized oscillons. We find it to be a power law in the
amplitude and couplings of the theory. Therefore, the quantum decay rate is
very different to the classical decay rate and is often dominant. We show that
essentially all oscillons eventually decay by producing outgoing radiation. In
single field theories the outgoing radiation has typically linear growth, while
if the oscillon is coupled to other bosons the outgoing radiation can have
exponential growth. The latter is a form of parametric resonance: explosive
energy transfer from a localized clump into daughter fields. This may lead to
interesting phenomenology in the early universe. Our results are obtained from
a perturbative analysis, a non-perturbative Floquet analysis, and numerics.

transitioned quickly from active accretion to quiescence, with the luminosity
dropping by over 3 orders of magnitude in ~13 days. The spectra obtained during
quiescence exhibit both a thermal component, presumed to originate in emission
from the NS surface, and a non-thermal component of uncertain origin, which has
shown large and irregular variability. We interpret the observed decay of the
inferred effective surface temperature of the NS in quiescence as the cooling
of the NS crust after having been heated and brought out of thermal equilibrium
with the core during the outburst. The interpretation of the data is
complicated by an apparent temporary increase in temperature ~220 days into
quiescence, possibly due to an additional spurt of accretion. We derive an
exponential decay timescale of ~120 (+30/-20) days for the inferred temperature
(excluding observations affected by the temporary increase). This short
timescale indicates a highly conductive NS crust. Further observations are
needed to confirm whether the crust is still slowly cooling or has already
reached thermal equilibrium with the core at a surface temperature of ~125 eV.
The latter would imply a high equilibrium bolometric thermal luminosity of
~5x10^{33} erg/s for an assumed distance of 8.8 kpc.

SiO is widespread along the IRDC (size >2 pc), showing two different

S), and the other weak and extended along the filament. While the first
component shows broad lines (linewidths of ~4-7 kms-1) in both SiO J=2-1 and

(~0.8 kms-1). The maps of CO and its isotopologues show that low-density
filaments are intersecting the IRDC and appear to merge toward the densest
portion of the cloud. This resembles the molecular structures predicted by
flow-driven, shock-induced and magnetically-regulated cloud formation models.
As in outflows associated with low-mass star formation, the excitation
temperatures and fractional abundances of SiO toward N, E and S, increase with
velocity from ~6 to 40 K, and from ~1E-10 to >1E-8 respectively, over a
velocity range of ~7 kms-1. Since 8 micron sources, 24 micron sources and/or
extended 4.5 micron emission are detected in N, E and S, broad SiO is likely
produced in outflows associated with high-mass protostars. The excitation
temperatures and fractional abundances of the narrow SiO lines, however, are
very low (~9 K and ~1E-11, respectively), and consistent with the processing of
interstellar grains by the passage of a shock with vs~12 kms-1. This emission
could be generated i) by a large-scale shock, perhaps remnant of the IRDC
formation process; ii) by decelerated or recently processed gas in large-scale
outflows driven by 8 micron and 24 micron sources; or iii) by an undetected and

stars constrain the sources of gas out of which these stars must have formed,
indicating that the gas must contain matter processed through the
high-temperature CNO cycle. First-generation massive Asymptotic Giant Branch
(AGB) stars have been proposed as the source of this gas. In a previous study,
by means of hydrodynamical and N-body simulations, we have shown that the AGB
ejecta collect in a cooling flow in the cluster core, where the gas reaches
high densities, ultimately forming a centrally concentrated subsystem of SG
stars. In this Letter we show that the high gas density can also lead to
significant accretion onto a pre-existing seed black hole. We show that gas
accretion can increase the black hole mass by up to a factor of 100. The
details of the gas dynamics are important in determining the actual black hole
growth. Assuming a near-universal seed black hole mass and small
cluster-to-cluster variations in the duration of the SG formation phase, the
outcome of our scenario is one in which the present intermediate-mass black
hole (IMBH) mass may have only a weak dependence on the current cluster
properties. The scenario presented provides a natural mechanism for the
formation of an IMBH at the cluster center during the SG star-formation phase.

prescriptions (yields) and prescriptions of star formation, have been computed
for the Milky Way. All models fit the observed O/H and Fe/H gradients well and
reproduce the main characteristics of the gas distribution, but they are also
designed to do so. For the C/H gradient the results are inconclusive with
regards to yields and star formation. The C/Fe and O/Fe vs. Fe/H, as well as
C/O vs. O/H trends predicted by the models for the solar neighbourhood zone
were compared with stellar abundances from the literature. For O/Fe vs. Fe/H
all models fit the data, but for C/O vs. O/H, only models with increased carbon
yields for zero-metallicity stars or an evolving initial mass function provide
good fits. Furthermore, a steep star formation threshold in the disc can be
ruled out since it predicts a steep fall-off in all abundance gradients beyond
a certain galactocentric distance (~ 13 kpc) and cannot explain the possible
flattening of the C/H and Fe/H gradients in the outer disc seen in
observations. Since in the best-fit models the enrichment scenario is such that
carbon is primarily produced in low-mass stars, it is suggested that in every
environment where the peak of star formation happened a few Gyr back in time,
winds of carbon-stars are responsible for most of the carbon enrichment.
However, a significant contribution by zero-metallicity stars, especially at
very early stages, and by winds of high-mass stars, which are increasing in
strength with metallicity, cannot be ruled out by the CEMs presented here. In
the solar neighbourhood, as much as 80%, or as little as 40% of the carbon may
have been injected to the interstellar medium by low- and intermediate-mass
stars. The stellar origin of carbon remains an open question, although
production in low- and intermediate-mass stars appears to be the simplest
explanation of observed carbon abundance trends.

high energy source in the sky. Its photon flux reached and surpassed the level
of 1e-5 ph/cm2/s above 100 MeV. The Swift satellite observed the source several
times during the period of high gamma-ray flux, and we can construct really
simultaneous spectral energy distributions (SED) before, during, and after the
luminosity peak. Our main findings are: i) the optical, X-ray and gamma-ray
fluxes correlate; ii) the gamma-ray flux varies quadratically (or even more)
with the optical flux; iii) a simple one-zone synchrotron inverse Compton model
can account for all the considered SED; iv) in this framework the gamma-ray vs
optical flux correlation can be explained if the magnetic field is slightly
fainter when the overall jet luminosity is stronger; v) the power that the jet
spent to produce the peak gamma-ray luminosity is of the same order, or larger,
than the accretion disk luminosity. During the flare, the total jet power
surely surpassed the accretion power.

one server arrive in the system according to a joint probability measure on
CxS, independently of the past. Also, at each time step, pairs of matched
customer and server, if they exist, depart from the system. Authorized
matchings are given by a fixed bipartite graph. A matching policy is chosen,
which decides how to match when there are several possibilities.
Customers/servers that cannot be matched are stored in a buffer. The evolution
of the model can be described by a discrete time Markov chain. We study its
stability under various admissible matching policies including: ML (Match the
Longest), MS (Match the Shortest), FIFO (match the oldest), priorities. There
exist natural necessary conditions for stability (independent of the matching
policy) defining the maximal possible stability region. For some bipartite
graphs, we prove that the stability region is indeed maximal for any admissible
matching policy. For the ML policy, we prove that the stability region is
maximal for any bipartite graph. For the MS and priority policies, we exhibit a
bipartite graph with a non-maximal stability region.

numerous applications. It is known, that it is complicated to obtain it
computationally, as a number of open questions and challenges indicate. In this
paper we propose a family of algorithms called \texttt{checkRoot} for optimized
check of whether a given rational number is a root of Bernstein-Sato polynomial
and the computations of its multiplicity. This algorithms are used in the new
approach to compute the whole global or local Bernstein-Sato polynomial and
$b$-function of a holonomic ideal with respect to weights. They are applied in
numerous situations, where there is a possibility to compute an upper bound for
the polynomial. Namely, it can be achieved by means of embedded resolution, for
topologically equivalent singularities or using the formula of A'Campo and
spectral numbers. We also present approaches to the logarithmic comparison
problem and the intersection homology D-module. Several applications are
presented as well as solutions to some challenges which were intractable with
the classical methods. One of the main applications consists of computing of a
stratification of affine space with the local $b$-function being constant on
each stratum. Notably, the algorithm we propose does not employ primary
decomposition. Also we apply our results for the computation of Bernstein-Sato
polynomials for varieties. The methods from this paper have been implemented in
{\sc Singular:Plural} as libraries {\tt dmod.lib} and {\tt bfun.lib}. All the
examples from the paper have been computed with this implementation.

and 870um by APEX. The large wavelength range of these observations and the
availability of spectroscopic redshifts allow us to unambiguously identify the
peak of the redshifted thermal emission from dust at ~ 300um. The SEDs of both
galaxies are reasonably well fit by synthetic templates of local galaxies with
L_IR ~ 10^{11} L_{sun} -- 10^{12} L_{sun} yet both galaxies have L_{IR} ~
10^{13} L_{sun}. This suggests that these galaxies are not high redshift
analogues of the Hyper-LIRGs/ULIRGs used in local templates, but are instead
""scaled up"" versions of local ULIRGs/LIRGs. For both galaxies the star
formation rate determined from the best-fit FIR SEDs (SFR(L_{IR})) agrees with
the SFR determined from the dust corrected H-alpha luminosity (SFR(H-alpha)) to
within a factor of ~ 2; however, when the SFR of these galaxies is estimated
using only the observed 24um flux and the standard luminosity-dependent
template method (SFR(24um)), it systematically overestimates the SFR by as much
as a factor of 6. A larger sample of 24 K-selected galaxies at z ~ 2.3 drawn
from the Kriek et al. (2008) GNIRS sample shows the same trend between
SFR(24um) and SFR(H-alpha). Using that sample we show that SFR(24um) and
SFR(H-alpha) are in better agreement when SFR(24um) is estimated using the log
average of local templates rather than selecting a single luminosity-dependent
template, because this incorporates lower luminosity templates. The better
agreement between SFRs from lower luminosity templates suggests that the FIR
SEDs of the BLAST-detected galaxies may be typical for massive galaxies at z ~
2, and that the majority are scaled up versions of lower luminosity local
galaxies.

The aim of this work is to study the contribution of the Ly-a emitters
(LAE) to the star formation rate density (SFRD) of the Universe in the interval
2<z<6.6.
  Methods. We assembled a sample of 217 LAE from the Vimos-VLT Deep Survey
(VVDS) with secure spectroscopic redshifts in the redshift range 2 < z < 6.62
and fluxes down to F=1.5x10^18 erg/s/cm^2. 133 LAE are serendipitous
identifications in the 22 arcmin^2 total slit area surveyed with the VVDS-Deep
and the 3.3 arcmin^2 from the VVDS Ultra-Deep survey, and 84 are targeted
identifications in the 0.62 deg^2 surveyed with the VVDS-DEEP and 0.16 deg^2
from the Ultra-Deep survey. Among the serendipitous targets we estimate that
90% of the emission lines are most probably Ly-a, while the remaining 10% could
be either [OII]3727 or Ly-a. We computed the LF and derived the SFRD from LAE
at these redshifts.
  Results. The VVDS-LAE sample reaches faint line fluxes F(Lya) = 1.5x1^18
erg/s/cm^2 (corresponding to L(Lya)=10^41 erg/s at z~3) enabling the faint end
slope of the luminosity function to be constrained to a=-1.6+-0.12 at redshift
z~2.5 and to a=-1.78+0.1-0.12 at z=4, placing on firm statistical grounds
trends found in previous LAE studies, and indicating that sub-L* LAE contribute
significantly to the SFRD. The projected number density and volume density of
faint LAE in 2<z<6.6 with F>1.5x10^18 erg/s/cm^2 are 33 galaxies/arcmin^2 and
4x10^-2 Mpc^-3, respectively. We find that the the observed luminosity function
of LAE does not evolve from z=2 to z=6. This implies that, after correction for
the redshift-dependent IGM absorption, the intrinsic LF must have evolved
significantly over 3 Gyr. The SFRD from LAE contributes to about 20% of the
SFRD at z =2-3, while the LAE appear to be the dominant source of star
formation producing ionizing photons in the early universe z>5-6, becoming
equivalent to that of Lyman Break galaxies.

the experimental values reported by the Fermilab (E791) Collaboration
represents approximately 56% of the values predicted by the linear \sigma-

ultraluminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs/ULIRGs). After analyzing the various
correlations among the global far-infrared (FIR), RC, CO, and HCN luminosities
and their various ratios, we conclude that the FIR-RC and FIR-HCN correlations
appear to be linear and are the tightest among all correlations. The
combination of these two correlations could result in the tight RC-HCN
correlation we observed. Meanwhile, the non-linear RC-CO correlation shows
slightly larger scatter as compared with the RC-HCN correlation, and there is
no correlation between ratios of either RC/HCN-CO/HCN or RC/FIR-CO/FIR. In
comparison, a meaningful correlation is still observed between ratios of
RC/CO-HCN/CO. Nevertheless, the correlation between RC/FIR and HCN/FIR also
disappears, reflecting again the two tightest FIR-RC and FIR-HCN correlations
as well as suggesting that FIR seems to be the bridge that connects HCN with
RC. Interestingly, despite obvious HCN-RC and RC-CO correlations,
multi-parameter fits hint that while both RC and HCN contribute significantly
(with no contribution from CO) to FIR, yet RC is primarily determined from FIR
with a very small contribution from CO and essentially no contribution from
HCN. These analyses confirm independently the former conclusions that it is
practical to use RC luminosity instead of FIR luminosity, at least globally, as
an indicator of star formation rate in galaxies including LIRGs/ULIRGs, and HCN
is a much better tracer of star-forming molecular gas and correlates with FIR
much better than that of CO.

thermodynamic functions of state and process variables remain unchanged when
the system is viewed at different time scales and resolutions. Our results show
that the dynamics on a fast time scale contribute an entropic term to the

conditional free energy $u_S(x)$, one can then treat the slow dynamics as if
the fast dynamics is nonexistent. Furthermore, we show that the free energy,
which characterizes the spontaneous organization in a system without detailed
balance, is invariant with or without the fast dynamics: The fast dynamics is
assumed to reach stationarity instantaneously on the slow time scale; they have
no effect on the system's free energy. The same can not be said for the entropy
and the internal energy, both of which contain the same contribution from the
fast dynamics. We also investigate the consequences of time-scale separation in
connection to the concepts of quasi-stationaryty and steady-adiabaticity

pollution from the first generation of the intermediate-mass asymptotic giant
branch stars to the proto-stellar clouds of the second generation of stars.
However, the primordial pollution scenario may not tell the whole story for the
observed Na-O anticorrelations in globular clusters. Using the recent data by
Carretta and his collaborators, the different shapes of the Na-O
anticorrelations for red giant branch stars brighter than and fainter than the
red giant branch bump can be clearly seen. If the elemental abundance
measurements by Carretta and his collaborators are not greatly in error, this
variation in the Na-O anticorrelation against luminosity indicates an internal
deep mixing episode during the ascent of the low-mass red giant branch in
globular clusters. Our result implies that the multiple stellar population
division scheme solely based on [O/Fe] and [Na/Fe] ratios of a globular
cluster, which is becoming popular, is not reliable for stars brighter than the
red giant branch bump. Our result also suggests that sodium supplied by the
deep mixing may alleviate the sodium under-production problem within the
primordial asymptotic giant branch pollution scenario.

also conceive of their General Relativistic (GR) version, ""Relativistic
Radiation Pressure Supported Stars"" (RRPSSs). While RPSSs have $z\ll 1$, RRPSSs
have $z \gg 1$, where $z$ is the surface gravitational redshift. Here we
elaborate on the formation of RRPSSs during continued gravitational collapse by
recalling that a contracting massive star must start trapping radiation as it
would enter its {\em photon sphere}. It is found that, irrespective of the
details of the contraction process, the trapped radiation flux should attain
the corresponding Eddington value at sufficiently large $z\gg 1$. This means
that continued GR collapse may generate an intermediate RRPSS with $z\gg 1$
before a true BH state with $z=\infty$ is formed asymptotically. An exciting
consequence of this is that the stellar mass black hole candidates, at present
epoch, should be hot balls of quark gluon plasma, as has been discussed by
Royzen in a recent article entitled ""{\it QCD against black holes?}"".

assume that this process is fast compared to other relevant timescales, and
occurs principally in the cold disk gas. We follow the turbulent energy density
using the Shabala & Alexander (2009) galaxy formation and evolution model.
Three processes are important to the turbulent energy budget: infall of cool
gas onto the disk and supernova feedback increase the turbulence; while star
formation removes gas and hence turbulent energy from the cold gas. Finally, we
assume that field energy is continuously transferred from the incoherent random
field into an ordered field by differential galactic rotation. Model
predictions are compared with observations of local late type galaxies by Fitt
& Alexander (1993) and Shabala et al. (2008). The model reproduces observed
magnetic field strengths and luminosities in low and intermediate-mass
galaxies. These quantities are overpredicted in the most massive hosts,
suggesting that inclusion of gas ejection by powerful AGNs is necessary in
order to quench gas cooling and reconcile the predicted and observed magnetic
field strengths.

map directions or routes based on the concept of natural roads. Natural roads
are joined road segments that perceptually constitute good continuity. This
approach relies on the connectivity of natural roads rather than that of road
segments for computing routes or map directions. Because of this, the derived
routes posses the fewest turns. However, what we intend to achieve are the
routes that not only possess the fewest turns, but are also as short as
possible. This kind of map direction is more effective and favorable by people,
because they bear less cognitive burden. Furthermore, the computation of the
routes is more efficient, since it is based on the graph encoding the
connectivity of roads, which is significantly smaller than the graph of road
segments. We made experiments applied to eight urban street networks from North
America and Europe in order to illustrate the above stated advantages. The
experimental results indicate that the fewest-turn routes posses fewer turns
and shorter distances than the simplest paths and the routes provided by Google
Maps. For example, the fewest-turn-and-shortest routes are on average 15%
shorter than the routes suggested by Google Maps, while the number of turns is
just half as much. This approach is a key technology behind FromToMap.org - a

continuation follows a scheme proposed by Bozis and Hadjidemetriou (1976) for
symmetric orbits. Our study includes also asymmetric periodic orbits, which
exist in cases of external resonances. The families formed by passing from the
restricted to the general problem are continued within the framework of the
general problem by varying the planetary mass ratio $\rho$. We obtain
bifurcations which are caused either due to collisions of the families in the
space of initial conditions or due to the vanishing of bifurcation points. Our
study refers to the whole range of planetary mass ratio values ($\rho \in
(0,\infty)$) and, therefore we include the passage from external to internal
resonances. In the present work, our numerical study includes the case of the
2/1 and 1/2 resonance. The same method can be used to study all other planetary
resonances.

of different sizes. A model is proposed where the particles are aggregated on
an initially flat surface, giving rise to a rough interface and a porous bulk.
By using Monte Carlo simulations, a surface has grown by adding particles of
different sizes, as well as identical particles on the substrate in (1 + 1)
dimensions. In the case of deposition of particles of different sizes, they are
selected from a Poisson distribution, where the particle's sizes may vary by
one order of magnitude. For the deposition of identical particles, only
particles which are larger than one lattice parameter of the substrate are
considered. We calculate the usual scaling exponents: the roughness, growth and
dynamic exponents $\alpha, \, \beta \,$ and $z$, respectively, as well as, the
porosity in the bulk, determining the porosity as a function of the particle
size. The results of our simulations show that the roughness evolves in time
following three different behaviors. The roughness in the initial times behaves
as in the random deposition model. At intermediate times, the surface roughness
grows slowly and finally, at long times, it enters into the saturation regime.
The bulk formed by depositing large particles reveals a porosity that increases
very fast at the initial times, and also reaches a saturation value. Excepting
the case where particles have the size of one lattice spacing, we always find
that the surface roughness and porosity reach limiting values at long times.
Surprisingly, we find that the scaling exponents are the same as those
predicted by the Villain-Lai-Das Sarma equation.

NRAO 150 is one of the brightest radio and mm AGN sources on the
northern sky. It has been revealed as an interesting source where to study
extreme relativistic jet phenomena. However, its cosmological distance has not
been reported so far, because of its optical faintness produced by strong
Galactic extinction.
  Aims. Aiming at measuring the redshift of NRAO 150, and hence to start making
possible quantitative studies from the source.
  Methods. We have conducted spectroscopic and photometric observations of the
source in the near-IR, as well as in the optical.
  Results. All such observations have been successful in detecting the source.
The near-IR spectroscopic observations reveal strong H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$
emission lines from which the cosmological redshift of NRAO 150
($z=1.517\pm0.002$) has been determined for the first time. We classify the
source as a flat-spectrum radio-loud quasar, for which we estimate a large
super-massive black-hole mass $\sim5\times 10^{9} \mathrm{M_\odot}$. After
extinction correction, the new near-IR and optical data have revealed a
high-luminosity continuum-emission excess in the optical (peaking at
$\sim2000$\,\AA, rest frame) that we attribute to thermal emission from the
accretion disk for which we estimate a high accretion rate, $\sim30$\,% of the
Eddington limit.
  Conclusions. Comparison of these source properties, and its broad-band
spectral-energy distribution, with those of Fermi blazars allow us to predict
that NRAO 150 is among the most powerful blazars, and hence a high luminosity
-although not detected yet- $\gamma$-ray emitter.

nonlinearity is made anisotropic through elliptic diffusivity. The medium
becomes semi-local in the limit case of 1D diffusivity. Families of fundamental

a numerical form. We demonstrate that the collapse of 2D beams is arrested even

at a time when physical conditions at the Earth where radically different from
its present state. The radiative input from the Sun was much enhanced in the
high-energy spectral domain, and in order to model early planetary atmospheres
in detail, a knowledge of the solar radiative input is needed. We present an
investigation of the atmospheric parameters, state of evolution and high-energy
fluxes of the nearby star kap^1 Cet, previously thought to have properties
resembling those of the early Sun. Atmospheric parameters were derived from the
excitation/ionization equilibrium of Fe I and Fe II, profile fitting of Halpha
and the spectral energy distribution. The UV irradiance was derived from FUSE
and HST data, and the absolute chromospheric flux from the Halpha line core.
From careful spectral analysis and the comparison of different methods we
propose for kap^1 Cet the following atmospheric parameters: Teff = 5665+/-30 K
(Halpha profile and energy distribution), log g = 4.49+/-0.05 dex (evolutionary
and spectroscopic) and [Fe/H] = +0.10+/-0.05 dex (Fe II lines). The UV
radiative properties of kap^1 Cet indicate that its flux is some 35% lower than
the current Sun's between 210 and 300 nm, it matches the Sun's at 170 nm and
increases to at least 2-7 times higher than the Sun's between 110 and 140 nm.
The use of several indicators ascribes an age to kap^1 Cet in the interval
~0.4-0.8 Gyr and the analysis of the theoretical HR diagram suggests a mass
~1.04 Msun. This star is thus a very close analog of the Sun when life arose on
Earth and Mars is thought to have lost its surface bodies of liquid water.
Photochemical models indicate that the enhanced UV emission leads to a
significant increase in photodissociation rates compared with those commonly
assumed of the early Earth. Our results show that reliable calculations of the
chemical composition of early planetary atmospheres need to account for the
stronger solar photodissociating UV irradiation.

the higher density of nodes deployed, the higher radio interference occurred.
This causes significant degradation of system performance. In this paper, we
first convert network problems into geometry problems in graph theory, and then
solve the interference problem by geometric algorithms. We first define line
intersection in a graph to reflect radio interference problem in a wireless

Delaunay Triangulation algorithm to reconstruct the graph in order to minimize

desired size of the set of selected features. Therefore, as a side effect we
obtain a new training algorithm for learning sparse linear RLS predictors which
can be used for large scale learning. This speed is possible due to matrix

balance between Fe I and Fe II, and Ca I and Ca II. Accurate abundances for a

excellent agreement with those previously derived for other strongly r-process

r-process pattern very well. No firm conclusion can be drawn with respect to a
relationship between the fisrt neutron-capture peak elements, Sr to Pd, in HE
2327-5642 and the Solar r-process, due to the uncertainty of the latter. A
clear distinction in Sr/Eu abundance ratios was found between the halo stars

skins, and the percentage of energy-weighted sum rule (EWSR) exhausted by the
Pygmy Dipole Resonance (PDR) in 68Ni and 132Sn have been investigated by using
different Random Phase Approximation (RPA) models for the dipole response,
based on a representative set of Skyrme effective forces plus meson-exchange
effective Lagrangians. A comparison with the experimental data has allowed us
to constrain the value of the derivative of the symmetry energy at saturation.
The neutron skin radius is deduced under this constraint.

quantile functions of positive random variables. We show that quantile clocks
can be chosen to be strictly increasing and continuous and discuss their
practical modeling advantages as business activity times in models for asset
prices. We show that the marginal distributions of a quantile clock, at each
fixed time, equate with the marginal distribution of a single subordinator.
Moreover, we show that there are many quantile clocks where one can specify
$L$, such that their marginal distributions have a desired law in the class of
generalized $s$-self decomposable distributions, and in particular the class of
self-decomposable distributions. The development of these results involves
elements of distribution theory for specific classes of infinitely divisible
random variables and also decompositions of a gamma subordinator, that is of
independent interest. As applications, we construct many price models that have
continuous trajectories, exhibit volatility clustering and have marginal
distributions that are equivalent to those of quite general exponential
L\'{e}vy price models. In particular, we provide explicit details for
continuous processes whose marginals equate with the popular VG, CGMY and NIG

quite poor, with relative proportions that depend on altitude above the snow
surface. This paper studies the temporal behavior of the good seeing sequences.
Aims: An efficient exploitation of extremely good seeing with an adaptive
optics system needs long integrations. It is then important to explore the
temporal distribution of the fraction of time providing excellent seeing.
Methods: Temporal windows of good seeing are created by a simple binary
process. Good or bad. Their autocorrelations are corrected for those of the
existing data sets, since these are not continuous, being often interrupted by
technical problems in addition to the adverse weather gaps. At the end these
corrected autocorrelations provide the typical duration of good seeing
sequences. This study has to be a little detailed as its results depend on the
season, summer or winter. Results: Using a threshold of 0.5 arcsec to define
the ""good seeing"", three characteristic numbers are found to describe the
temporal evolution of the good seeing windows. The first number is the mean
duration of an uninterrupted good seeing sequence: it is $\tau_0=7.5$ hours at
8 m above the ground (15 hours at 20 m). These sequences are randomly
distributed in time, with a negative exponential law of damping time
$\tau_1=29$ hours (at elevation 8 m and 20 m). The third number is the mean
time between two 29 hours episodes. It is T=10 days at 8 m high (5 days at 20
m).

where each individual is totally connected to the members of its group and is
linked to the individuals of the other groups with a given probability. During
a time step, the individual has to decide between discussing with a member of
its own network and applying the opinion dynamics, or moving groups because it
has an opinion far from the average opinion of its own group. One of the main
results we obtained is that the group sizes, starting from an homogeneous
situation can be strongly heterogeneous at the equilibrium state. This kind of
heterogeneity can be identified in many real networks. In this paper we present
the complete set of behaviours that this complex model can exhibit, at group

goal is to constrain the millisecond pulsar populations in globular clusters
from analysis of gamma-ray observations. We use 546 days of continuous
sky-survey observations obtained with the Large Area Telescope aboard the Fermi
Gamma-ray Space Telescope to study the gamma-ray emission towards 13 globular
clusters. Steady point-like high-energy gamma-ray emission has been
significantly detected towards 8 globular clusters. Five of them (47 Tucanae,
Omega Cen, NGC 6388, Terzan 5, and M 28) show hard spectral power indices $(0.7
< \Gamma <1.4)$ and clear evidence for an exponential cut-off in the range
1.0-2.6 GeV, which is the characteristic signature of magnetospheric emission
from MSPs. Three of them (M 62, NGC 6440 and NGC 6652) also show hard spectral
indices $(1.0 < \Gamma < 1.7)$, however the presence of an exponential cut-off
can not be unambiguously established. Three of them (Omega Cen, NGC 6388, NGC
6652) have no known radio or X-ray MSPs yet still exhibit MSP spectral
properties. From the observed gamma-ray luminosities, we estimate the total
number of MSPs that is expected to be present in these globular clusters. We
show that our estimates of the MSP population correlate with the stellar
encounter rate and we estimate 2600-4700 MSPs in Galactic globular clusters,
commensurate with previous estimates. The observation of high-energy gamma-ray
emission from a globular cluster thus provides a reliable independent method to
assess their millisecond pulsar populations that can be used to make
constraints on the original neutron star X-ray binary population, essential for
understanding the importance of binary systems in slowing the inevitable core
collapse of globular clusters.

the symmetry group of the SIC~POVM is a subgroup of the Clifford group. Hence,
two SIC~POVMs covariant with respect to the HW group are unitarily or
antiunitarily equivalent if and only if they are on the same orbit of the
extended Clifford group. In dimension three, each group covariant SIC~POVM may
be covariant with respect to three or nine HW groups, and the symmetry group of
the SIC~POVM is a subgroup of at least one of the Clifford groups of these HW
groups respectively. There may exist two or three orbits of equivalent
SIC~POVMs for each group covariant SIC~POVM, depending on the order of its

uncover additional SIC~POVMs by regrouping of the fiducial vectors from
different SIC~POVMs which may or may not be on the same orbit of the extended

Spectropolarimetric data were obtained with FORS1 at UT2 on Paranal observatory
to measure the disk-averaged longitudinal magnetic field at various phases of
the presumed 0.52 d cycle. A variable magnetic field with strengths between B_z
= -2200 and +3200G was found, with confidence limits of 100 to 130G. The field
topology is that of an oblique dipole, while the star itself is seen about
equator-on. In the intensity spectra the HeI-lines show the typical equivalent
width variability of He-strong stars, usually attributed to surface abundance
spots. The amplitudes of the equivalent width variability of the HeI lines are
extraordinarily strong compared to other cases. These results not only put HR
7355 unambiguously among the early-type magnetic stars, but confirm its
outstanding nature: With v sin i = 320 km/s the parameter space in which
He-strong stars are known to exist has doubled in terms of rotational velocity.

to clusters within the same age range. They have irregular stellar radial
density distributions (RDPs) with a marked excess in the innermost region, a
feature that, at less than 10 Myr, is more likely related to the star formation
and/or molecular cloud fragmentation than to age-dependent dynamical effects.
The velocity dispersion of both clusters, derived from proper motions, is in
the range $\sim15 - 22 \kms$. Both clusters appear to be in a super-virial
state, with velocity dispersions higher than those expected of
nearly-virialised clusters of similar mass and size. A possible interpretation
is that Cr 197 and vdB 92 deviate critically from dynamical equilibrium, and
may dissolve into the field. We also conclude that early cluster dissolution
leaves detectable imprints on RDPs of clusters as massive as several $10^2

applications rather difficult, particularly if extreme electronic anisotropy

Different laws of friction are considered. The topology of the phase space is
essential in understanding the evolution of the system. The topology is
determined by the families of stable and unstable periodic orbits, both
symmetric and non symmetric. It is along the stable families, or close to them,
that the planets migrate when dissipative forces act. At the critical points
where the stability along the family changes, there is a bifurcation of a new
family of stable periodic orbits and the migration process changes route and
follows the new stable family up to large eccentricities or to a chaotic
region. We consider both resonant and non resonant planetary systems. The 2/1,
3/1 and 3/2 resonances are studied. The migration to larger or smaller
eccentricities depends on the particular law of friction. Also, in some cases
the semimajor axes increase and in other cases they are stabilized. For

frictional forces, it is possible to have partially stationary solutions, where
