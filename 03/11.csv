Qiu","Need-based Communication for Smart Grid: When to Inquire Power Price?","submitted to IEEE 2010'Globecom",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In smart grid, a home appliance can adjust its power consumption level
according to the realtime power price obtained from communication channels.
Most studies on smart grid do not consider the cost of communications which
cannot be ignored in many situations. Therefore, the total cost in smart grid
should be jointly optimized with the communication cost. In this paper, a
probabilistic mechanism of locational margin price (LMP) is applied and a model
for the stochastic evolution of the underlying load which determines the power
price is proposed. Based on this framework of power price, the problem of
determining when to inquire the power price is formulated as a Markov decision
process and the corresponding elements, namely the action space, system state
and reward function, are defined. Dynamic programming is then applied to obtain
the optimal strategy. A simpler myopic approach is proposed by comparing the
cost of communications and the penalty incurred by using the old value of power
price. Numerical results show the significant performance gain of the optimal
strategy of price inquiry, as well as the near-optimality of the myopic
approach.

via price signaling. The communication between the power supplier and power
customers is a key issue in smart grid. Performance degradation like delay or
outage may cause significant impact on the stability of the pricing based
control and thus the reward of smart grid. Therefore, a QoS mechanism is
proposed for the communication system in smart grid, which incorporates the
derivation of QoS requirement and applies QoS routing in the communication
network. For deriving the QoS requirement, the dynamics of power load and the
load-price mapping are studied. The corresponding impacts of different QoS
metrics like delay are analyzed. Then, the QoS is derived via an optimization
problem that maximizes the total revenue. Based on the derived QoS requirement,
a simple greedy QoS routing algorithm is proposed for the requirement of high
speed routing in smart grid. It is also proven that the proposed greedy
algorithm is a $K$-approximation. Numerical simulation shows that the proposed
mechanism and algorithm can effectively derive and secure the communication QoS
in smart grid.

here that, in the weak field limit, the HL proposal leads to a modification of
the gravitational potential because of two additive terms (scaling respectively

general expression to compute the rotation curve of an extended system under
the assumption that the mass density only depends on the cylindrical

the circular velocity on the mass function which is a new feature of the
theory. As a first exploratory analysis, we then try fitting the Milky Way
rotation curve using its visible components only in order to see whether the HL
modified potential can be an alternative to the dark matter framework. This
turns out not to be the case so that we argue that dark matter is still needed,
but the amount of dark matter and the dark halo density profile have to be
revised according to the new HL potential.

of the local ULIRG/AGN Mrk 231 if placed at 1<z<3 whilst most of the SMGs have
colours very similar to those of the local ULIRG Arp 220 at 1<z<3. Mid-infrared
diagnostics therefore find no strong evidence that the SMGs host buried AGN

suggest that the QSOs sit in regions of the early universe which are undergoing
an enhanced level of major star-formation activity, and should evolve to become
similarly dense regions containing massive galaxies at the present epoch.

been suggested to be a neutron star. If so, it hosts the closest known neutron
star, and its existence implies a great abundance of similar systems and a rate
of white-dwarf neutron-star mergers similar to that of the type Ia supernova
rate. Here, we present high signal-to-noise spectra of SDSS 1257+5428, which
confirm an independent finding that the system is in fact composed of two white
dwarfs, one relatively cool and with low mass, and the other hotter and more
massive. With this, the demographics and merger rate are no longer puzzling
(various factors combine to lower the latter by more than two orders of
magnitude). We show that the spectra are fit well with a combination of two
hydrogen model atmospheres, as long as the lines of the higher-gravity
component are broadened significantly relative to what is expected from just
pressure broadening. Interpreting this additional broadening as due to
rotation, the inferred spin period is short, about 1 minute. Similarly rapid
rotation is only seen in accreting white dwarfs that are magnetic; empirically,
it appears that in non-magnetized white dwarfs, accreted angular momentum is
lost by nova explosions before it can be transferred to the white dwarf. This
suggests that the massive white dwarf in SDSS 1257+5428 is magnetic as well,
with B~10^5 G. Alternatively, the broadening seen in the spectral lines could
be due to a stronger magnetic field, of ~10^6 G. The two models could be
distinguished by further observations.

parameters. For an assumed central gas temperature k_B*T_0=0.6 keV, we find
that neglecting the gravitational effects of stars, which can contribute
substantially in the innermost regions, leads to an underestimate of the
enclosed baryonic gas mass by up to ~65% at the effective radius, and by up to
~15% at the NFW scale radius, depending on the stellar baryon fraction. This
formula is therefore important for estimating the baryon fraction in an
unbiased fashion. These new hydrostatic equilibrium solutions, derived for the
isothermal and polytropic cases, can also be used to generate more realistic
initial conditions for simulations of elliptical galaxies. Moreover, the new
formulation is relevant when interpreting X-ray data. We compare our composite
isothermal model to the standard beta-model used to fit X-ray observations of
early-type galaxies, to determine the value of the NFW scale radius r_s.
Assuming a 10% stellar baryon fraction, we find that the exclusion of stars
from the gravitational potential leads to (i) an underestimate of r_s by ~80%,
and to (ii) an overestimate of the enclosed dark matter at r_s by a factor of
~2, compared to the equivalent beta-model fit results when stars are not taken
into account. For higher stellar mass fractions, a beta-model is unable to
accurately reproduce our solution, indicating that when the observed surface
brightness profile of an isolated elliptical galaxy is found to be well fitted
by a beta-model, the stellar mass fraction cannot be much greater than ~10%.

an oscillating function of the RF amplitude. The results are explained
qualitatively as a consequence of two processes. The first is the modulation of
the phase difference between the N/S interfaces by the RF field, with the
resistance adiabatically following the phase. The second process is the change
in the electron temperature caused by the RF field. From the data the response
time of the Andreev interferometer is estimated to be <40ps. However there are
a number of experimental features which remain unexplained; these include the
drastic difference in the behaviour of the resistance at different phases as a

correlator of the components of the current parallel to the magnetic field
decays much slower than in the absence of a magnetic field, while for other
components the correlation length slightly decreases. We apply the maximal
entropy method to extract the corresponding spectral function. In the limit of
zero frequency this spectral function yields the electric conductivity of the

field induces nonzero electric conductivity along the direction of the field,
transforming the system from an insulator into an anisotropic conductor. In the
deconfinement phase the conductivity does not exhibit any sizable dependence on
the magnetic field.

cosmological length scales has yet to be stringently tested. Such a test has
recently been proposed, using a quantity, EG, that combines measures of
large-scale gravitational lensing, galaxy clustering and structure growth rate.
The combination is insensitive to 'galaxy bias' (the difference between the
clustering of visible galaxies and invisible dark matter) and is thus robust to
the uncertainty in this parameter. Modified theories of gravity generally
predict values of EG different from the general relativistic prediction
because, in these theories, the 'gravitational slip' (the difference between
the two potentials that describe perturbations in the gravitational metric) is
non-zero, which leads to changes in the growth of structure and the strength of
the gravitational lensing effect3. Here we report that EG = 0.39 +/- 0.06 on
length scales of tens of megaparsecs, in agreement with the general
relativistic prediction of EG $\approx$ 0.4. The measured value excludes a
model within the tensor-vector-scalar gravity theory, which modifies both
Newtonian and Einstein gravity. However, the relatively large uncertainty still
permits models within f(R) theory, which is an extension of general relativity.
A fivefold decrease in uncertainty is needed to rule out these models.

equivalent to non-detection of rapidity gaps in pp collisions. For example, in
coherent photoproduction of vector mesons their 4-momentum transfer
distribution would image the ""gluon charge"" in the nucleus in the same way that
Hofstadter measured its charge structure using elastic scattering of $\sim$100

electron due to excitation of nuclear energy levels (Figure 1), even the energy
spread of the incident beam would prevent such an inclusive selection of
quasielastic events at an eIC. The only available tool is fragment detection.
Since, in our example, one finds that $\sim100$ of deexcitations go through

of low redshift, disk-dominated star-forming galaxies using photometry from
GALEX and SDSS. By considering broadband colors as a function of galaxy
inclination we are able to confidently separate trends arising from increasing
dust opacity from possible differences in stellar populations, since stellar
populations do not correlate with inclination. All commonly employed dust
attenuation curves (such as the Calzetti curve for starbursts, or a power-law
curve) provide poor fits to the ultraviolet colors for moderately and highly
inclined galaxies. This conclusion rests on the fact that the average FUV-NUV
color varies little from face-on to edge-on galaxies, while other colors such
as NUV-u and u-r vary strongly with inclination. After considering a number of
model variations, we are led to speculate that the presence of the strong dust
extinction feature at 2175A seen in the Milky Way (MW) extinction curve is
responsible for the observed trends. Independent of our interpretation, these
results imply that the modeling of dust attenuation in the ultraviolet is
significantly more complicated than traditionally assumed. These results also
imply a very weak dependence of the FUV-NUV color on total FUV attenuation, and
we conclude from this that it is extremely difficult to use only the observed
UV spectral slope to infer the total UV dust attenuation, as is commonly done.
We propose several simple tests that might finally identify the grain
population responsible for the 2175A feature.

resisted explanation in terms of a true counterflow superfluid, though many

widely believed that quenched disorder is the root cause of this puzzle. Here
we model the nonperturbative effects of disorder by investigating the $\nu=1$
bilayer in a strong periodic potential. Our model assumes that fermions are
gapped and real spins are fully polarized, and concentrates on the pseudospin
variable (the layer index), with the external potential coupling to the
topological (Pontryagin) density of the pseudospin. We find that as the
potential strength increases, there are ground state transitions in which the
topological content of the pseudospin configuration changes. These transitions
are generically weakly first-order, with a new quadratically dispersing mode
(in addition to the linearly dispersing Goldstone mode) sometimes becoming
nearly gapless near the transition. We show that this leads to strong
suppressions of both the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature and the
interlayer tunneling strength, which we treat perturbatively. We discuss how
these results might extend to the case of true disorder.

Richardson Hamiltonian is represented as a direct sum of Hamiltonians acting in
different Hilbert spaces of single-particle and paired/empty states. This
allows us to factorize the full thermodynamic partition function into a
combination of simple terms associated with real spins on singly-occupied
states and the partition function of the quantum XY-model for Anderson
pseudospins associated with the paired/empty states. Using coherent-state
path-integral, we calculate the effects of superconducting phase fluctuations
exactly. The contribution of superconducting amplitude fluctuations to the
partition function in the broken-symmetry phase is shown to follow from the
Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations in imaginary time. These equations in turn allow
several interesting mappings, e.g., they are shown to be in a one-to-one
correspondence with the one-dimensional Schr\""odinger equation in
supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics. However, the most practically useful approach
to calculate functional determinants is found to be via an analytical
continuation of the quantum order parameter to real time, \Delta(\tau -> it),
such that the problem maps onto that of a driven two-level system. The
contribution of a particular dynamic order parameter to the partition function
is shown to correspond to the sum of the Berry phase and dynamic phase
accumulated by the pseudospin. We also examine a family of exact solutions for
two-level-system dynamics on a class of elliptic functions and suggest a
compact expression to estimate the functional determinants on such

and zigzag atomic chains of all 4$d$ and 5$d$ transition metals (TM) within the
GGA by using the accurate PAW method, has been carried out. All the TM linear
chains are found to be unstable against the corresponding zigzag structures.
All the TM chains, except Nb, Ag and La, have a stable (or metastable) magnetic
state in either the linear or zigzag or both structures. Magnetic states appear
also in the sufficiently stretched Nb and La linear chains and in the largely
compressed Y and La chains. The spin magnetic moments in the Mo, Tc, Ru, Rh, W,
Re chains could be large ($\geq$1.0 $\mu_B$/atom). Structural transformation
from the linear to zigzag chains could suppress the magnetism already in the
linear chain, induce the magnetism in the zigzag structure, and also cause a
change of the magnetic state (ferromagnetic to antiferroamgetic or vice verse).
The calculations including the spin-orbit coupling reveal that the orbital
moments in the Zr, Tc, Ru, Rh, Pd, Hf, Ta, W, Re, Os, Ir and Pt chains could be
rather large ($\geq$0.1 $\mu_B$/atom). Importantly, large magnetic anisotropy
energy ($\geq$1.0 meV/atom) is found in most of the magnetic TM chains,
suggesting that these nanowires could have fascinating applications in
ultrahigh density magnetic memories and hard disks. In particular, giant
magnetic anisotropy energy ($\geq$10.0 meV/atom) could appear in the Ru, Re,
Rh, and Ir chains. Furthermore, the magnetic anisotropy energy in several
elongated linear chains could be as large as 40.0 meV/atom. A
spin-reorientation transition occurs in the Ru, Ir, Ta, Zr, La and Zr, Ru, La,
Ta and Ir linear chains when they are elongated. Remarkably, all the 5$d$ as
well as Tc and Pd chains show the colossal magnetic anisotropy (i.e., it is
impossible to rotate magnetization into certain directions). Finally, the
electronic band structure and density of states of the nanowires have also been
calculated in order to understand the electronic origin of the large magnetic
anisotropy and orbital magnetic moment as well as to estimate the conduction
electron spin polarization.

is based on fixing the outage scenarios in advance and transforming the design

quantizing the channel magnitude in dB scale is asymptotically optimal,
regardless of the magnitude distribution function. We derive the optimal
uniform (in dB) channel magnitude codebook and combine it with a spatially
uniform channel direction codebook to arrive at a product channel quantization
codebook. We then optimize such a product structure in the asymptotic regime of
$B\rightarrow \infty$, where $B$ is the total number of quantization feedback
bits. The paper shows that for channels in the real space, the asymptotically
optimal number of direction quantization bits should be ${(M{-}1)}/{2}$ times
the number of magnitude quantization bits, where $M$ is the number of base
station antennas. We also show that the performance of the designed system
approaches the performance of the perfect channel state information system as
$2^{-\frac{2B}{M+1}}$. For complex channels, the number of magnitude and

performance scales as $2^{-\frac{B}{M}}$ as $B\rightarrow\infty$.

multi-user spatial multiplexing systems. A multiple-antenna base-station is
assumed to serve multiple single-antenna users, who quantize and feed back
their channel state information (CSI) through a shared rate-limited feedback
channel. The optimization problem is cast in the form of minimizing the average
transmission power at the base-station subject to users' target
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINR) and outage probability
constraints. The goal is to derive the feedback bit allocations among the users
and the corresponding channel magnitude and direction quantization codebooks in
a high-resolution quantization regime. Toward this end, this paper develops an
optimization framework using approximate analytical closed-form solutions, the
accuracy of which is then verified by numerical results. The results show that,
for channels in the real space, the number of channel direction quantization
bits should be $(M-1)$ times the number of channel magnitude quantization bits,
where $M$ is the number of base-station antennas. Moreover, users with higher
requested quality-of-service (QoS), i.e. lower target outage probabilities, and
higher requested downlink rates, i.e. higher target SINR's, should use larger
shares of the feedback rate. It is also shown that, for the target QoS
parameters to be feasible, the total feedback bandwidth should scale
logarithmically with the geometric mean of the target SINR values and the
geometric mean of the inverse target outage probabilities. In particular, the
minimum required feedback rate is shown to increase if the users' target
parameters deviate from the corresponding geometric means. Finally, the paper
shows that, as the total number of feedback bits $B$ increases, the performance
of the limited-feedback system approaches the perfect-CSI system as
${2^{-{B}/{M^2}}}$.

the major flare event of 2003 October 28 during the solar cycle 23. We have
applied wavelet transform to the time series of disk-integrated velocity
signals from the solar surface using the full-disk Dopplergrams obtained from
MDI. The wavelet power spectrum computed from MDI velocity series clearly shows
that there is enhancement of high-frequency global waves in the Sun during the

these velocity oscillations. However, the analysis of disk-integrated velocity
observations obtained from GOLF shows only feeble effect of flare on

clusters formed in cosmological simulations of the Lambda-CDM cosmology and
compare it to the shape of dark matter distribution and the shape of the
overall isopotential surfaces. We find that in simulations with radiative
cooling, star formation and stellar feedback (CSF), intracluster gas outside
the cluster core is more spherical compared to non-radiative (NR) simulations,
while in the core the gas in the CSF runs is more triaxial and has a distinctly
oblate shape. The latter reflects the ongoing cooling of gas, which settles
into a thick oblate ellipsoid as it loses thermal energy. The shape of the gas
in the inner regions of clusters can therefore be a useful diagnostic of gas
cooling. We find that gas traces the shape of the underlying potential rather
well outside the core, as expected in hydrostatic equilibrium. At smaller
radii, however, the gas and potential shapes differ significantly. In the CSF
runs, the difference reflects the fact that gas is partly rotationally
supported. Interestingly, we find that in NR simulations the difference between
gas and potential shape at small radii is due to random gas motions, which make
the gas distribution more spherical than the equipotential surfaces. Finally,
we use mock Chandra X-ray maps to show that the differences in shapes observed
in three-dimensional distribution of gas are discernible in the ellipticity of
X-ray isophotes. Contrasting the ellipticities measured in simulated clusters
against observations can therefore constrain the amount of cooling of the
intracluster medium and the presence of random gas motions in cluster cores.

between users from statistical effects due to the assortative mixing of user

users with similar topical interests are more likely to be friends, and
therefore semantic similarity measures among users based solely on their

be written as lagrangian of the scalar field propagating in a curved
noncommutative space. In this interpretation, renormalizability of the model is
related to the interaction with the background curvature which introduces
explicit coordinate dependence in the action. In this paper we construct the
$U_1$ gauge field on the same noncommutative space: since covariant derivatives
contain coordinates, the Yang-Mills action is again coordinate dependent. To
obtain a two-dimensional model we reduce to a subspace, which results in
splitting of the degrees of freedom into a gauge and a scalar. We define the
gauge fixing and show the BRST invariance of the quantum action.

is investigated by utilizing PIC (Particle-In-Cell) simulation and model
analyses. In the model analyses saturation levels of effective electron
temperature as a result of microinstabilities are estimated from an extended
quasilinear (trapping) analysis for relatively low (high) Mach number shocks.
Here, MTSI (modified two-stream instability) is assumed to become dominant in
low Mach number regime, while BI (Buneman instability) to become dominant in
high Mach number regime, respectively. It is revealed that Mach number
dependence of the effective electron temperature in the MTSI dominant case is
essentially different from that in the BI dominant case. The effective electron
temperature through the MTSI does not depend much on the Mach number, although
that through the BI increases with the Mach number as in the past studies. The
results are confirmed to be consistent with the PIC simulations both in
qualitative and quantitative levels. The model analyses predict that a critical
Mach number above which steep rise of electron heating rate occurs may arise at
the Mach number of a few tens.

precursor of C-shocks. Previous observations of SiO, H13CO+, HN13C and H13CN
toward the young L1448-mm outflow showed an over-excitation of the ion fluid
that was attributed to an electron density enhancement in the precursor. We
re-visit this interpretation and test if it still holds when we consider
different source morphologies and kinetic temperatures for the observed
molecules, and also give some insight on the spatial extent of the electron
density enhancement around L1448-mm.
  We estimate the opacities of H13CO+ and HN13C by observing the J=3\to2 lines
of rarer isotopologues to confirm that the emission is optically thin. To model
the excitation of the molecules, we use the large velocity gradient (LVG)
approximation with updated collisional coefficients to i) re- analyse the
observations toward the positions where the over-excitation of H13CO+ has
previously been observed [i.e. toward L1448- mm at offsets (0,0) and (0,-10)],
and ii) to investigate if the electron density enhancement is still required
for the cases of extended and compact emission, and for kinetic temperatures of
up to 400 K. We also report several lines of SiO, HN13C and H13CO+ toward new
positions around this outflow, to investigate the spatial extent of the
over-excitation of the ions in L1448-mm. From the isotopologue observations, we
find that the emission of H13CO+ and HN13C from the precursor is optically thin
if this emission is extended. Using the new collisional coefficients, an
electron density enhancement is still needed to explain the excitation of
H13CO+ for extended emission and for gas temperatures of\le 400 K toward
L1448-mm (0,-10), and possibly also toward L1448-mm (0,0). For compact emission
the data cannot be fitted. We do not find any evidence for the over-excitation
of the ion fluid toward the newly observed positions around L1448-mm.
  The observed line emission of SiO, H13CO+ and HN13C toward L1448-mm (0,0) and
(0,-10) is consistent with an electron density enhancement in the precursor
component, if this emission is spatially extended. This is also true for the
case of high gas temperatures (\le400 K) toward the (0,-10) offset. The
electron density enhancement seems to be restricted to the southern, redshifted
lobe of the L1448-mm outflow. Interferometric images of the line emission of
these molecules are needed to confirm the spatial extent of the over-excitation
of the ions and thus, of the electron density enhancement in the magnetic
precursor of L1448-mm.

we derive and theoretically support a macroscopic, spatially discrete, model

special coupling condition between neighbouring elements preserves the
self-adjoint dynamics and controls interelement interactions. When the
interelement coupling parameter is small, an averaging method and an asymptotic
expansion of the slow modes show that the macroscopic discrete model will be a
family of coupled stochastic ordinary differential equations which describe the

self-interaction energy density shows that it can be the dominant contribution

nucleosynthesis is used to restrict the interaction strength, which we find to
be at least as strong as the strong interaction. Furthermore we explore dark
matter decoupling in a self-interaction dominated universe, which is done for
the self-interacting warm dark matter as well as for collisionless cold dark
matter in a two component scenario. We find that strong dark matter
self-interactions do not contradict super-weak inelastic interactions between

J. C. Bioch in 1976. A weaker form of n-isoclinism, called relative
n-isoclinism, will be discussed. This will allow us to improve some classical
results in literature. We will point out the connections between a relative
n-isoclinism and the notions of commutativity degree, n-th nilpotency degree
and relative n-th nilpotency degree, which arouse interest in the
classification of groups of prime power order in the last years.

experience, i.e. using rules of thumb, although some aspects and cases have
been treated rigorously. In this paper we present a mathematical framework
capable of describing the fundamental limits of radio astronomical imaging
problems. Although the data model assumes a single snapshot observation, i.e.
variations in time and frequency are not considered, this framework is
sufficiently general to allow extension to synthesis observations. Using tools
from statistical signal processing and linear algebra, we discuss the
tractability of the imaging and deconvolution problem, the redistribution of
noise in the map by the imaging and deconvolution process, the covariance of
the image values due to propagation of calibration errors and thermal noise and
the upper limit on the number of sources tractable by self calibration. The
combination of covariance of the image values and the number of tractable
sources determines the effective noise floor achievable in the imaging process.
The effective noise provides a better figure of merit than dynamic range since
it includes the spatial variations of the noise. Our results provide handles
for improving the imaging performance by design of the array.

colorless dipole elastic scattering amplitudes in N=4 SYM gauge theory through
the Wilson loop correlator formalism and Euclidean to Minkowskian analytic
continuation. The purely elastic behavior obtained at large impact-parameter L,
through duality from disconnected AdS_5 minimal surfaces beyond the
Gross-Ooguri transition point, is combined with unitarity and analyticity
constraints in the central region. In this way we obtain an absolute bound on
the high-energy behavior of the forward scattering amplitude due to the
graviton interaction between minimal surfaces in the bulk. The dominant
""Pomeron"" intercept is bounded by alpha less than or equal to 11/7 using the
AdS/CFT constraint of a weak gravitational field in the bulk. Assuming the
elastic eikonal approximation in a larger impact-parameter range gives alpha
between 4/3 and 11/7. The actual intercept becomes 4/3 if one assumes the
elastic eikonal approximation within its maximally allowed range L larger than
exp{Y/3}, where Y is the total rapidity. Subleading AdS/CFT contributions at
large impact-parameter due to the other d=10 supergravity fields are obtained.
A divergence in the real part of the tachyonic KK scalar is cured by
analyticity but signals the need for a theoretical completion of the AdS/CFT
scheme.

mergers, provide conditions where strange quark matter can appear. The high
degree of isospin asymmetry and temperatures of several MeV in such systems may
cause a transition to the quark phase already around saturation density.
Observable signals from the appearance of quark matter can be predicted and
studied in astrophysical simulations. As input in such simulations, an equation
of state with an integrated quark matter phase transition for a large
temperature, density and proton fraction range is required. Additionally,
restrictions from heavy ion data and pulsar observation must be considered. In
this work we present such an approach. We implement a quark matter phase
transition in a hadronic equation of state widely used for astrophysical
simulations and discuss its compatibility with heavy ion collisions and pulsar
data. Furthermore, we review the recently studied implications of the QCD phase
transition during the early post-bounce evolution of core-collapse supernovae
and introduce the effects from strong interactions to increase the maximum mass
of hybrid stars. In the MIT bag model, together with the strange quark mass and
the bag constant, the strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$ provides a parameter
to set the beginning and extension of the quark phase and with this the mass
and radius of hybrid stars.

models and in their own right. Cluster age and mass distributions within
galaxies are probes of star formation histories, and of cluster formation and
disruption processes. The vast majority of clusters in the Universe is small,
and it is well known that the integrated fluxes and colors have broad
probability distributions, due to small numbers of bright stars. This paper
goes beyond the description of predicted probability distributions, and
presents results of the analysis of cluster energy distributions in an
explicitly stochastic context. The method developed is Bayesian. It provides
posterior probability distributions in the age-mass-extinction space, using
multi-wavelength photometric observations and a large collection of Monte-Carlo
simulations of clusters of finite stellar masses. Both UBVI and UBVIK datasets
are considered, and the study conducted in this paper is restricted to the
solar metallicity. We first reassess and explain errors arising from the use of
standard analysis methods, which are based on continuous population synthesis
models: systematic errors on ages and random errors on masses are large, while
systematic errors on masses tend to be smaller. The age-mass distributions
obtained after analysis of a synthetic sample are very similar to those found
for real galaxies in the literature. The Bayesian approach on the other hand,
is very successful in recovering the input ages and masses. Taking stochastic
effects into account is important, more important for instance than the choice
of adding or removing near-IR data in many cases. We found no immediately
obvious reason to reject priors inspired by previous (standard) analyses of
cluster populations in galaxies, i.e. cluster distributions that scale with
mass as M^-2 and are uniform on a logarithmic age scale.

stars and black holes, which can be sources of gravitational waves. Recent
population synthesis models can predict neutron star and gravitational wave
observations but deal with a fixed super nova rate or an assumed initial mass
function for the population of massive stars. Here we investigate those massive
stars, which are supernova progenitors, i.e. with O and early B type stars, and
also all super giants within 3kpc. We restrict our sample to those massive
stars detected both in 2MASS and observed by Hipparcos, i.e. only those stars
with parallax and precise photometry. To determine the luminosities we
calculated the extinctions from published multi-colour photometry, spectral
types, luminosity class, all corrected for multiplicity and recently revised
Hipparcos distances. We use luminosities and temperatures to estimate the
masses and ages of these stars using different models from different authors.
Having estimated the luminosities of all our stars within 3kpc, in particular
for all O- and early B-type stars, we have determined the median and mean
luminosities for all spectral types for luminosity classes I, III, and V. Our
luminosity values for super giants deviate from earlier results: Previous work
generally overestimates distances and luminosities compared to our data, this
is likely due to Hipparcos parallaxes (generally more accurate and larger than
previous ground-based data) and the fact that many massive stars have recently
been resolved into multiples of lower masses and luminosities. From
luminosities and effective temperatures we derived masses and ages using mass
tracks and isochrones from different authors. From masses and ages we estimated
lifetimes and derived a lower limit for the supernova rate of ~20 events/Myr
averaged over the next 10 Myrs within 600 pc from the sun. These data are then
used to search for areas in the sky with higher likelihood for a supernova or

studied the multifrequency nature and time evolution of the dominant peak at
~0.75 mHz using the standard Lomb-Scargle method and a 2-D sine fitting method.
We found a double structure of the peak and its overtone for days 180 and 196.
The two frequencies were closer together on day 196, suggesting that the
difference between the two peaks is gradually decreasing. For the later
observations, only a single frequency can be detected, which is likely due to
the exposure times being shorter than the beat period between the two peaks,
especially if they are moving closer together. The observations on days 742 and
1286 are long enough to detect two frequencies with the difference found for
day 196, but we confidently find only a single frequency. We found significant
changes in the oscillation frequency and amplitude. We have derived blackbody
temperatures from the SSS spectra, and the evolution of changes in frequency
and blackbody temperature suggests that the 0.75-mHz peak was modulated by
pulsations. Later, after nuclear burning had ceased, the signal stabilised at a
single frequency, although the X-ray frequency differs from the optical/UV
frequency obtained consistently from the OM onboard XMM and from ground-based

theory. Further, some of TiO2's most important properties, such as its
electronic band gap, the localized character of excitons, and the localized
nature of states induced by oxygen vacancies, are still under debate. We
present a unified description of the properties of rutile and anatase phases,
obtained from ab initio state of the art methods, ranging from density
functional theory (DFT) to many body perturbation theory (MBPT) derived
techniques. In so doing, we show how advanced computational techniques can be
used to quantitatively describe the structural, electronic, and optical
properties of TiO2 nanostructures, an area of fundamental importance in applied
research. Indeed, we address one of the main challenges to TiO2-photocatalysis,
namely band gap narrowing, by showing how to combine nanostructural changes
with doping. With this aim we compare TiO2's electronic properties for 0D
clusters, 1D nanorods, 2D layers, and 3D bulks using different approximations
within DFT and MBPT calculations. While quantum confinement effects lead to a
widening of the energy gap, it has been shown that substitutional doping with
boron or nitrogen gives rise to (meta-)stable structures and the introduction
of dopant and mid-gap states which effectively reduce the band gap. Finally, we
report how ab initio methods can be applied to understand the important role of
TiO2 as electron-acceptor in dye-sensitized solar cells. This task is made more

medium developed fast in the past decades. The theory of supersonic magnetized
turbulence, as well as the understanding of projection effects of observed
quantities, are still in progress. In this work we explore the characterization
of the turbulent cascade and its damping from observational spectral line
profiles. We address the difference of ion and neutral velocities by clarifying
the nature of the turbulence damping in the partially ionized. We provide
theoretical arguments in favor of the explanation of the larger Doppler
broadening of lines arising from neutral species compared to ions as arising
from the turbulence damping of ions at larger scales. Also, we compute a number
of MHD numerical simulations for different turbulent regimes and explicit
turbulent damping, and compare both the 3-dimensional distributions of velocity
and the synthetic line profile distributions. From the numerical simulations,
we place constraints on the precision with which one can measure the 3D
dispersion depending on the turbulence sonic Mach number. We show that no
universal correspondence between the 3D velocity dispersions measured in the
turbulent volume and minima of the 2D velocity dispersions available through
observations exist. For instance, for subsonic turbulence the correspondence is
poor at scales much smaller than the turbulence injection scale, while for
supersonic turbulence the correspondence is poor for the scales comparable with
the injection scale. We provide a physical explanation of the existence of such
a 2D-3D correspondence and discuss the uncertainties in evaluating the damping
scale of ions that can be obtained from observations. However, we show that the
statistics of velocity dispersion from observed line profiles can provide the
spectral index and the energy transfer rate of turbulence. Also, comparing two
similar simulations with different viscous coefficients it was possible to
constrain the turbulent cut-off scale. This may especially prove useful since
it is believed that ambipolar diffusion may be one of the dominant dissipative
mechanism in star-forming regions. In this case, the determination of the
ambipolar diffusion scale may be used as a complementary method for the
determination of magnetic field intensity in collapsing cores. We discuss the
implications of our findings in terms of a new approach to magnetic field

by sign strings containing relative orientations of embedded edges. We
demonstrate that these signature factors are a special representation of the
general mathematical concept of an oriented matroid. Moreover, we show that
oriented matroids can also be used to describe the topology (connectedness) of
directed graphs. Hence the mathematical methods developed for oriented matroids
can be applied to the difficult combinatorics of embedded graphs underlying the
construction of LQG. As a first application we revisit the analysis of [4-5],

equivalent to enumerating all realizable oriented matroids of rank 3, and thus
can be greatly simplified. We find that for 7-valent vertices having no
coplanar triples of edge tangents, the smallest non-zero eigenvalue of the
volume spectrum does not grow as one increases the maximum spin $\jmax$ at the
vertex, for any orientation of the edge tangents. This indicates that, in
contrast to the area operator, considering large $\jmax$ does not necessarily
imply large volume eigenvalues. In addition we give an outlook to possible

its interaction with a pre-existing field of an active region. We investigate
the emission of jets as a result of repeated reconnection events between
colliding magnetic fields. We perform 3D simulations by solving the
time-dependent, resistive MHD equations in a highly stratified atmosphere. A
small active region field is constructed by the emergence of a toroidal
magnetic flux tube. A current structure is build up and reconnection sets in
when new emerging flux comes into contact with the ambient field of the active
region. The topology of the magnetic field around the current structure is
drastically modified during reconnection. The modification results in a
formation of new magnetic systems that eventually collide and reconnect. We
find that reconnection jets are taking place in successive recurrent phases in
directions perpendicular to each other, while in each phase they release
magnetic energy and hot plasma into the solar atmosphere. After a series of
recurrent appearance of jets, the system approaches an equilibrium where the
efficiency of the reconnection is substantially reduced. We deduce that the
emergence of new magnetic flux introduces a perturbation to the active region
field, which in turn causes reconnection between neighboring magnetic fields
and the release of the trapped energy in the form of jet-like emissions. This
is the first time that self-consistent recurrency of jets in active regions is
shown in a three-dimensional experiment of magnetic flux emergence.

two-dimensional band structure with a strongly enhanced Rashba-type
spin-splitting, which is in part attributed to the structural asymmetry
resulting from an outward relaxation of the alloy atoms. In order to gain
further insight into the spin-splitting mechanism, we have experimentally
determined the outward relaxation of the alloy atoms in these surface alloys
using quantitative low-energy electron diffraction (LEED). The structure plays
an important role in the size of the spinsplitting as it dictates the potential
landscape, the symmetry as well as the orbital character. Furthermore, we
discuss the band ordering of the Pb/Ag(111) surface alloy as well as the
reproducible formation of Sb/Ag(111) surface alloys with unfaulted

astronomy. Interferometry resolved this issue by filtering the incoming light
with single-mode fibers. Thanks to this technique, we obtained with the IOTA
interferometer very precise measurements of the spatial frequencies of seven
evolved stars. From these measurements, we performed a blind deconvolution to
restore an image of the surface of the stars. Six of the them, Betelgeuse, Mu
Cep, R leo, Mira, Chi Cyg and CH Cyg, feature very asymmetrical brightness
distributions. On the other hand, the Arcturus data are extremely well fitted
with a simple limb-darkened photospheric disc. From the observations of $\chi$
Cyg, we show that the star is surrounded by a molecular shell undergoing a
ballistic motion. We propose to use the same technique of spatial filtering
with single-mode fibers to correct for the effect of turbulence in the pupil of
a telescope. Because the pupil is redundant, this technique does require a
remapping of the pupil. We developed a dedicated algorithm to show that it was
possible to reconstruct images at the diffraction limit of the telescope free
of any speckle noise. Our simulations show that a high dynamic range (over
10^6) could be obtained in the visible on an 8 meter telescope. A lab
experiment is under construction to validate the concept of this new
instrument.

Couette-Poiseuille flow in the presence of a cross-flow. The base flow is
characterised by the cross flow Reynolds number, $R_{inj}$ and the
dimensionless wall velocity, $k$. Squire's transformation may be applied to the
linear stability equations and we therefore consider 2D (spanwise-independent)
perturbations. Corresponding to each dimensionless wall velocity, $k\in[0,1]$,
two ranges of $R_{inj}$ exist where unconditional stability is observed. In the
lower range of $R_{inj}$, for modest $k$ we have a stabilisation of long
wavelengths leading to a cut-off $R_{inj}$. This lower cut-off results from
skewing of the velocity profile away from a Poiseuille profile, shifting of the
critical layers and the gradual decrease of energy production. Cross-flow
stabilisation and Couette stabilisation appear to act via very similar
mechanisms in this range, leading to the potential for robust compensatory
design of flow stabilisation using either mechanism. As $R_{inj}$ is increased,
we see first destabilisation and then stabilisation at very large $R_{inj}$.
The instability is again a long wavelength mechanism. Analysis of the
eigenspectrum suggests the cause of instability is due to resonant interactions
of Tollmien-Schlichting waves. A linear energy analysis reveals that in this
range the Reynolds stress becomes amplified, the critical layer is irrelevant
and viscous dissipation is completely dominated by the energy
production/negation, which approximately balances at criticality. The
stabilisation at very large $R_{inj}$ appears to be due to decay in energy
production, which diminishes like $R_{inj}^{-1}$. Our study is limited to two
dimensional, spanwise independent perturbations.

CWRU Burrell Schmidt telescope by presenting B-band surface photometry of the
core of the Virgo cluster in order to study the cluster's intracluster light
(ICL). We find ICL features down to mu_b ~ 29 mag sq. arcsec, confirming the
results of Mihos et al. (2005), who saw a vast web of low-surface brightness
streams, arcs, plumes, and diffuse light in the Virgo cluster core using V-band
imaging. By combining these two data sets, we are able to measure the optical
colors of many of the cluster's low-surface brightness features. While much of
our imaging area is contaminated by galactic cirrus, the cluster core near the
cD galaxy, M87, is unobscured. We trace the color profile of M87 out to over
2000 arcsec, and find a blueing trend with radius, continuing out to the
largest radii. Moreover, we have measured the colors of several ICL features
which extend beyond M87's outermost reaches and find that they have similar
colors to the M87's halo itself, B-V ~ 0.8. The common colors of these features
suggests that the extended outer envelopes of cD galaxies, such as M87, may be
formed from similar streams, created by tidal interactions within the cluster,
that have since dissolved into a smooth background in the cluster potential.
