Social Welfare Function (GSWF) with at least three alternatives, which
satisfies Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) and Unanimity and is
not a dictatorship, is necessarily non-transitive. In 2002, Kalai asked whether
one can obtain the following quantitative version of the theorem: For any
$\epsilon>0$, there exists $\delta=\delta(\epsilon)$ such that if a GSWF on
three alternatives satisfies the IIA condition and its probability of
non-transitive outcome is at most $\delta$, then the GSWF is at most
$\epsilon$-far from being a dictatorship or from breaching the Unanimity
condition. In 2009, Mossel proved such quantitative version, with
$\delta(\epsilon)=\exp(-C/\epsilon^{21})$, and generalized it to GSWFs with $k$
alternatives, for all $k \geq 3$. In this paper we show that the quantitative
version holds with $\delta(\epsilon)=C \cdot \epsilon^3$, and that this result
is tight up to logarithmic factors. Furthermore, our result (like Mossel's)
generalizes to GSWFs with $k$ alternatives. Our proof is based on the works of
Kalai and Mossel, but uses also an additional ingredient: a combination of the
Bonami-Beckner hypercontractive inequality with a reverse hypercontractive
inequality due to Borell, applied to find simultaneously upper bounds and lower

interpreted as a coarse simple connectedness condition on the Cayley graph, and
in particular is a quasi-isometry invariant. In the appendix, an example of a

ejection(CME)-streamer interaction events were recorded by the Large Angle and
Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO). At the beginning of the events, the streamer
was pushed aside from their equilibrium position upon the impact of the rapidly
outgoing and expanding ejecta; then, the streamer structure, mainly the bright
streamer belt, exhibited elegant large scale sinusoidal wavelike motions. The
motions were apparently driven by the restoring magnetic forces resulting from
the CME impingement, suggestive of magnetohydrodynamic kink mode propagating
outwards along the plasma sheet of the streamer. The mode is supported
collectively by the streamer-plasma sheet structure and is therefore named
""streamer wave"" in the present study. With the white light coronagraph data, we
show that the streamer wave has a period of about 1 hour, a wavelength varying
from 2 to 4 solar radii, an amplitude of about a few tens of solar radii, and a
propagating phase speed in the range 300 to 500 km s$^{-1}$. We also find that
there is a tendancy for the phase speed to decline with increasing heliocentric
distance. These observations provide good examples of large scale wave
phenomena carried by coronal structures, and have significance in developing
seismological techniques for diagnosing plasma and magnetic parameters in the
outer corona.

problem of space debris is similar to other international environmental
problems in that there is a potential for a tragedy of the commons
effect--individual nations bear all the cost of their mitigation measures but
share only a fraction of the benefit. Consequently, nations have a tendency to
underinvest in mitigation. Coalitions of nations, brought together by IEAs,
have the potential to lessen the tragedy of the commons effect by pooling the
costs and benefits of mitigation. This work brings together two recent modeling
advances: i) a game theoretic model for studying the potential gains from IEA
cooperation between nations with asymmetric costs and benefits, ii) an orbital
debris model that gives the societal cost that specific actions, such as
failing to deorbit an inactive satellite, have on the environment. We combine
these two models with empirical launch share data for a ""proof of concept"" of
an IEA for a single mitigation measure, deorbiting spacecraft at the end of
operational lifetime. Simulations of all possible coalitions for a proxy set of
12 asymmetric nations suggest the possibility that stable coalitions can
provide significant deorbiting gains relative to nations acting in the absence
of an IEA coalition.

SOHO/MDI (Michelson Doppler Imager on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory)
magnetograms have been studied to measure the east-west inclination angle,
indicating the toroidal component of the photospheric magnetic field. This
analysis reveals that the large-scale toroidal component of the global magnetic
field is antisymmetric around the equator and reverses direction in regions
associated with flux from one solar cycle compared to the next. The toroidal
field revealed the first early signs of cycle 24 at high latitudes, especially
in the northern hemisphere, appearing as far back as 2003 in the WSO data and
2004 in MDI. As in previous cycles, the feature moves gradually equatorward.
Cycles overlap and the pattern associated with each cycle lasts about 17 years.
Even though the polar field at the current solar minimum is significantly lower
than the three previous minima, the toroidal field pattern is similar.

displace the particle cloud while the vortex is off or weak. This ""stretch,

which is responsible for chaotic transport of perfect tracers, except that in
the present case the vortex motion is replaced by gravitational settling. In
the present work this phenomenon is analyzed for heavy Stokes particles moving
under the sole effect of gravity and of a linear drag. The vortex is taken to
be a fixed isolated point vortex the intensity of which varies under the effect
of either boundary conditions or volume force. When the unsteadiness of the
vortex is weak and the free-fall velocity is of the order of the fluid
velocity, and the particle response time is small, the particle motion equation
can be written asymptotically as a perturbed hamiltonian system the phase
portrait of which displays a homoclinic trajectory. A homoclinic bifurcation is
therefore likely to occur, and the contribution of particle inertia to the
occurrence of this bifurcation is analyzed asymptotically by using Melnikov's
method.

algorithms -- the Maximum-Aposteriori Probability (MAP) and the
Minimum-Mean-Squared-Error (MMSE) estimators, under the assumption that the
dictionary is unitary. It is well known that both these estimators lead to a
scalar shrinkage on the transformed coefficients, albeit with a different

these shrinkage curves and then analyze their performance. Upper bounds on the
MAP and the MMSE estimation errors are derived. We tie these to the error
obtained by a so-called oracle estimator, where the support is given,
establishing a worst-case gain-factor between the MAP/MMSE estimation errors
and the oracle's performance. These denoising algorithms are demonstrated on
synthetic signals and on true data (images).

Such arrangement of the windings leads to a substantial reduction of AC losses

shape information currently contained in the SDSS DR7 halo power spectrum (HPS)
is by far superseded by geometric information derived from the baryonic
features. An immediate corollary is that contrary to popular beliefs, the upper
limit on the neutrino mass m_\nu presently derived from LSS combined with
cosmic microwave background (CMB) data does not in fact arise from the possible
small-scale power suppression due to neutrino free-streaming, if we limit the

becomes crucial for the resolution of parameter degeneracies. This conclusion
will remain true even when data from the Planck surveyor become available. In

However, despite a sustained effort over more than five decades, the strongest
overall existence results are asymptotic results of the form: for all odd
natural numbers $k$, there is a Hadamard matrix of order $k2^{[a+b\log_2k]}$,
where $a$ and $b$ are fixed non-negative constants. To prove the Hadamard
Conjecture, it is sufficient to show that we may take $a=2$ and $b=0$. Since
Seberry's ground-breaking result, which showed that we may take $a=0$ and
$b=2$, there have been several improvements where $b$ has been by stages
reduced to 3/8. In this paper, we show that for all $\epsilon>0$, the set of
odd numbers $k$ for which there is a Hadamard matrix of order
$k2^{2+[\epsilon\log_2k]}$ has positive density in the set of natural numbers.
The proof adapts a number-theoretic argument of Erdos and Odlyzko to show that
there are enough Paley Hadamard matrices to give the result.

general relativity. We present a model for a cosmological system involving two
holographic screens and find that their equilibrium exactly yields a standard
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe. We discuss its cosmological implications
by taking into account higher order quantum corrections and quantum nature of
horizon evaporation. We will show that this model could give rise to a
holographic inflation at high energy scales and realize a late-time
acceleration in a unified approach. We test our model from the SN Ia
observations and find it can give a nice fit to the data.
