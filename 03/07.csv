method for graphene-inspired exfoliation of crystalline bismuth telluride films
with a thickness of a few atoms. The atomically thin films were suspended
across trenches in Si/SiO2 substrates, and subjected to detail
characterization. The presence of the van der Waals gaps allowed us to
disassemble Bi2Te3 crystal into its quintuple building blocks - five
mono-atomic sheets consisting of Te(1)-Bi-Te(2)-Bi-Te(1). By altering the
thickness and sequence of atomic planes we were able to create designer
non-stoichiometric quasi-2D crystalline films, change their composition and
doping, as well as other properties. The exfoliated quintuples and ultra-thin
films have low thermal conductivity, high electrical conductivity and enhanced
thermoelectric properties. The obtained results pave the way for producing
stacks of crystalline bismuth telluride quantum wells with the strong spatial
confinement of charge carriers and acoustic phonons for thermoelectric devices.
The developed technology for producing free-standing quasi-2D layers of
Te(1)-Bi-Te(2)-Bi-Te(1) creates an impetus for investigation of the topological

The red supergiant (RSG) Betelgeuse is an irregular variable star.
Convection may play an important role in understanding this variability.
Interferometric observations can be interpreted using sophisticated simulations
of stellar convection. Aims. We compare the visibility curves and closure
phases obtained from our 3D simulation of RSG convection with CO5BOLD to
various interferometric observations of Betelgeuse from the optical to the H
band in order to characterize and measure the convection pattern on this star.
Methods. We use 3D radiative-hydrodynamics (RHD) simulation to compute
intensity maps in different filters and we thus derive interferometric
observables using the post-processing radiative transfer code OPTIM3D. The
synthetic visibility curves and closure phases are compared to observations.
Results. We provide a robust detection of the granulation pattern on the
surface of Betelgeuse in the optical and in the H band based on excellent fits
to the observed visibility points and closure phases. Moreover, we determine
that the Betelgeuse surface in the H band is covered by small to medium scale
(5-15 mas) convection-related surface structures and a large (30 mas)
convective cell. In this spectral region, H2O molecules are the main absorbers
and contribute to the small structures and to the position of the first null of
the visibility curve (i.e. the apparent stellar radius).

the dynamics and structure of aquatic communities. Here, using an
advection-reaction-diffusion model, we investigate the distribution and
competition of phytoplankton species in a water column, in which inverse
resource gradients of light and a nutrient can limit growth of the biomass.
This problem poses a challenge for ecologists, as the location of a production
layer is not fixed, but rather depends on many internal parameters and
environmental factors. In particular, we study the influence of an upper mixed
layer (UML) in this system and show that it leads to a variety of dynamic
effects: (i) Our model predicts alternative density profiles with a maximum of
biomass either within or below the UML, thereby the system may be bistable or
the relaxation from an unstable state may require a long-lasting transition.
(ii) Reduced mixing in the deep layer can induce oscillations of the biomass;
we show that a UML can sustain these oscillations even if the diffusivity is
less than the critical mixing for a sinking phytoplankton population. (iii) A
UML can strongly modify the outcome of competition between different
phytoplankton species, yielding bistability both in the spatial distribution
and in the species composition. (iv) A light limited species can obtain a
competitive advantage if the diffusivity in the deep layers is reduced below a
critical value. This yields a subtle competitive exclusion effect, where the
oscillatory states in the deep layers are displaced by steady solutions in the
UML. Finally, we present a novel graphical approach for deducing the
competition outcome and for the analysis of the role of a UML in aquatic
systems.

combinatorial optimization that, given an undirected graph, ask that its
so-called chromatic and independence numbers be found. Though NP-hard, when
solved on sequences of expanding random graphs there appear marked transitions
at which optimal solutions can be obtained substantially more easily than right
before them. We demonstrate that these phenomena can be understood by resorting
to the network that represents the solution space of the problems for each
graph and examining its conduciveness between the non-optimal solutions and the
optimal ones. At the said transitions, this network becomes strikingly more
conducive in the direction of the optimal solutions than it was just before
them, while at the same time becoming less conducive in the opposite direction.
We believe that, besides becoming useful also in other areas in which network
theory has a role to play, network conduciveness may become instrumental in
helping clarify further issues related to NP-hardness that remain poorly
understood.

  Requires Kinetic Proofreading","29 pages, 11 figures",,,,"q-bio.CB physics.bio-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  B cells signaling in response to antigen is proportional to antigen affinity,
a process known as affinity discrimination. Recent research suggests that B
cells can acquire antigen in membrane-bound form on the surface of
antigen-presenting cells (APCs), with signaling being initiated within a few
seconds of B cell/APC contact. During the earliest stages of B cell/APC
contact, B cell receptors (BCRs) on protrusions of the B cell surface bind to
antigen on the APC surface and form micro-clusters of 10-100 BCR/Antigen
complexes. In this study, we use computational modeling to show that B cell
affinity discrimination at the level of BCR-antigen micro-clusters requires a
threshold antigen binding time, in a manner similar to kinetic proofreading. We
find that if BCR molecules become signaling-capable immediately upon binding
antigen, there is a loss in serial engagement due to the increase in bond
lifetime as koff decreases. This results in decreasing signaling strength as
affinity increases. A threshold time for antigen to stay bound to BCR before
the latter becomes signaling-capable favors high affinity BCR-antigen bonds, as
these long-lived bonds can better fulfill the threshold time requirement than
low-affinity bonds. A threshold antigen binding time of ~10 seconds results in
monotonically increasing signaling with affinity, replicating the affinity
discrimination pattern observed in B cell activation experiments. This time
matches well (within order of magnitude) with the experimentally observed time
(~ 20 seconds) required for the BCR signaling domains to undergo antigen and
lipid raft-mediated conformational changes that lead to association with Syk.

light is produced by TP-AGB stars during the first Gyr of a stellar population,
with a substantial fraction continuing to be produced by the TP-AGB over a
Hubble time. Between 0.2 and 1.5 Gyr, intermediate mass stars evolve into
TP-AGB C stars which, due to significant amounts of circumstellar dust, emit
half their energy in the mid-IR. We combine these results using published
mid-IR colors of Galactic TP-AGB M and C stars to construct simple models for
exploring the contribution of the TP-AGB to 24micron data as a function of
stellar population age. We compare these empirical models with an ensemble of
galaxies in the CDFS from z=0 to z=2, and with high quality imaging in M81.
Within the uncertainties, the TP-AGB appears responsible for a substantial
fraction of the mid-IR luminosities of galaxies from z=0 to z=2, the maximum
redshift to which we can test our hypothesis, while, at the same time, our
models reproduce much of the detailed structure observed in mid-IR imaging of
M81. The mid-IR is a good diagnostic of star formation over timescales of ~1.5
Gyr, but this implies that on-going star formation rates at z=1 may be
overestimated by factors of ~1.5-6, depending on the nature of star formation
events. Our results, if confirmed through subsequent work, have strong
implications for the star formation rate density of the universe and the growth
of stellar mass over time.

their low encoding-decoding complexity. In the special case of symmetric main

creation of advantage over Eve, by blindly using the proposed scheme over each

(b) a cool disk sandwiched by disk coronae (disk corona model), and (c) the
combination of those two (hybrid model). The basic features we require for
successful models are (i) significant hard X-ray emission whose luminosity
exceeds that of soft X-rays, (ii) high hard X-ray luminosities in the range of
(0.4 - 30) times 10^{37} erg s^{-1}, and (iii) the existence of two power-law
components in the hard X-ray band with the photon indices of Gamma_s ~ 2 >
Gamma_h, where Gamma_s and Gamma_h are the photon indices of the softer (<10
keV) and the harder (>10 keV) power-law components, respectively. Contribution
by non-thermal electrons nor time-dependent evolution are not considered. We
find that Models (a) and (b) can be ruled out, since the spectra are always
dominated by the soft component, and since only one power-law component, at
most, can be reproduced. Only Model (c) can account for sufficiently strong
hard X-ray emissions, as well as the existence of the two power-law components,
for a large ratio of the accretion rate in the corona to that in the thin disk.
The outer disk corona (where the Compton y-parameter is smaller, y < 1)
produces the softer power-law component with photon index of Gamma_s ~ 2,
whereas the inner hot flow (where y gtrsim 1) generates the harder component
with Gamma_h < 2. This model can also account for the observed relationship
between the photon index and the reflection fraction.

gravitons acquire mass in the process of spontaneous symmetry breaking of

should find the gravitational Higgs mechanism such that it results in massive
gravity in a flat Minkowski space-time without non-unitary propagating modes.
This is usually achieved by including higher-derivative terms in scalars and
tuning the cosmological constant to be a negative value in a proper way.
Recently, a similar but different gravitational Higgs mechanism has been
advocated by Chamseddine and Mukhanov where one can relax the negative
cosmological constant to zero or positive one. In this work, we investigate why
the non-unitary ghost mode decouples from physical Hilbert space in a general
space-time dimension. Moreover, we generalize the model to possess an arbitrary
potential and clarify under what conditions the general model exhibits the
gravitational Higgs mechanism. By searching for solutions to the conditions, we
arrive at two classes of potentials exhibiting gravitational Higgs mechanism.
One class includes the model by Chamseddine and Mukhanov in a specific case

neutrino mass matrix, and to be consistent with observed results of the
neutrino oscillation, the models are subject to an approximate $\mu$-$\tau$
symmetry. There are two categories of approximately $\mu$-$\tau$ symmetric
models classified as (C1) yielding $\sin^22\theta_{23} \approx 1$ and
$\sin^2\theta_{13} \ll 1$ and (C2) yielding $\sin^22\theta_{23} \approx 1$ and
$\Delta m_\odot^2/|\Delta m_{atm}^2|\ll 1$, where $\theta_{23(13)}$ stands for
the mixing of massive neutrinos $\nu_2$ and $\nu_3$ ($\nu_1$ and $\nu_3$) and
$\Delta m_ \odot ^2$ ($\Delta m_{atm}^2$) stands for the mass squared
difference for atmospheric (solar) neutrinos. The Majorana phase can be large
for the normal mass hierarchy and for the inverted mass hierarchy with
$m_1\approx -m_2$ only realized in (C1) while they are generically small for
the inverted mass hierarchy with $m_1\approx m_2$ in both (C1) and (C2). These
results do not depend on a specific choice of phases in $M_\nu$ but hold true
in any models with $\det(M_\nu)=0$ because of the rephasing invariance.

functions of the form $(f \comp g^n)(x,y)=f(g(x^1, y^1),..., g(x^n,y^n))$. This
is a rich family of functions which encompasses many of the important examples
in the literature. It is thus of great interest to understand what properties
of $f$ and $g$ affect the communication complexity of $(f \comp g^n)$, and in
what way.
  Recently, Sherstov \cite{She09b} and independently Shi-Zhu \cite{SZ09b}
developed conditions on the inner function $g$ which imply that the quantum
communication complexity of $f \comp g^n$ is at least the approximate
polynomial degree of $f$. We generalize both of these frameworks. We show that
the pattern matrix framework of Sherstov works whenever the inner function $g$
is {\em strongly balanced}---we say that $g: X \times Y \to \{-1,+1\}$ is
strongly balanced if all rows and columns in the matrix $M_g=[g(x,y)]_{x,y}$
sum to zero. This result strictly generalizes the pattern matrix framework of
Sherstov \cite{She09b}, which has been a very useful idea in a variety of
settings \cite{She08b,RS08,Cha07,LS09,CA08,BHN09}.
  Shi-Zhu require that the inner function $g$ has small {\em spectral
discrepancy}, a somewhat awkward condition to verify. We relax this to the
usual notion of discrepancy. We also enhance the framework of composed
functions studied so far by considering functions $F(x,y) = f(g(x,y))$, where
the range of $g$ is a group $G$. When $G$ is Abelian, the analogue of the
strongly balanced condition becomes a simple group invariance property of $g$.
We are able to formulate a general lower bound on $F$ whenever $g$ satisfies
this property.

gravity without horizon formation? This depends on the existence, viability and
reasonableness of alternative theories of gravity without black holes.
  Here a theory of gravity without black hole horizon formation is presented.
The gravitational collapse stops shortly before horizon formation and leaves a
stable frozen star. In the limit $\Xi, \Upsilon\to 0$ the Einstein equations of
GR are recovered, and the frozen stars become observationally indistinguishable
from GR black holes. The theory therefore provides a counterexample to recent
claims that observational evidence from black hole candidates ""all but requires
the existence of a horizon"".
  The theory presented here shares its equations with RTG. Nonetheless, as is
shown, there remain important conceptual and physical differences. In
particular, some serious problems of RTG are not present in the theory proposed
here. So it can be argued that the theory is a physically viable and
conceptually sound alternative to GR.

texture properties are extracted from the fingerprint and iris images
respectively. Subsequently, the extracted features are fused together at the
feature level to construct the multi-biometric template. Finally, a 256-bit
secure cryptographic key is generated from the multi-biometric template. For
experimentation, we have employed the fingerprint images obtained from publicly

The emphasis is laid on the crucial ingredient of this method - the effective

tested. First, a quantum-mechanical potential model which provides the only
possibility to probe the reliability and the actual accuracy of the sum-rule
method is used as a study case. In this model, our algorithm is shown to lead
to a remarkable improvement of the accuracy of the extracted ground-state

poses the problem of searching for particular realizations of the theory which
may be relevant for \textit{the statistical description of turbulence} and in
particular for the so-called \textit{homogeneous, isotropic}and
\textit{stationary} turbulence (HIST). Here the problem is set in terms of the
$1-$point velocity probability density function (PDF) which determines a
complete IKT-statistical model for NS fluids. This raises the interesting
question of identifying the statistical assumptions under which a Gaussian PDF
can be achieved in such a context. In this paper it is proven that for the IKT
statistical model, HIST requires necessarily that $f_{1}$ must be SIED (namely
\textit{stationary}, \textit{isotropic} and \textit{% everywhere-defined}).
This implies, in turn, that the functional form of the PDF is uniquely
prescribed at all times. In particular, it is found that necessarily the PDF
must coincide with an isotropic Gaussian distribution. The conclusion is
relevant for the investigation of the so-called homogenous, isotropic and
stationary turbulence.

varieties. If the source space is a weak Fano (or Fano) manifold, then so is
the target space. Our proof is Hodge theoretic. We do not need mod $p$
reduction arguments. We also discuss related topics and questions.

  Doppler residuals for the Messenger flybys of Mercury","8 pages, 4 figures",,,,"physics.gen-ph gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In 2007, the observed Earth flyby anomalies have been successfully simulated
using an empirical formula (H. J. Busack, 2007). This simulation has led to the
prediction of anomaly values, to be expected for the Rosetta flybys of Mars in
2007, and following twice of Earth in 2007 and 2009. While the data for the
Mars flyby are yet under evaluation, the predictions of the formula for the
last two Earth flybys of Rosetta are fully confirmed now. This is remarkable,
since an alternatively proposed formula (Anderson et al., 2007) failed to
predict the correct values for the recent flybys. For the Mercury flybys of the
Messenger spacecraft, this alternative formula predicts a null result. In the
meantime, Doppler residuals of these flybys on 14.01.2008 and 06.10.2008 are
availabel. On both flybys, significant residuals were observed, using gravity
data derived by Mariner 10 on Mercury (D. E. Smith et al., 2009). According to
the authors, these residuals cannot be eliminated totally by adjustment of the
second degree gravity coefficients and by assumption of irregular mass
concentrations of acceptable value on Mercury. In this investigation, I adapt
the output of the simulation program to compare with the measured Doppler
residuals of the Mercury flybys without changing the formerly derived
parameters for the Earth flybys. The simulation with these parameters leads to
Doppler residuals of the Mercury flybys compatible with the measured curves.
Additionally, the expected flyby anomalies are calculated. Since the gravity
field of Mercury is not explored yet with sufficient accuracy, this result
cannot be falsified or confirmed until the evaluation of the coming Mercury
orbits of Messenger will be finished. If the proposed empirical formula would
be confirmed then again, this would be a strong indication of an underlying
physical reality.
