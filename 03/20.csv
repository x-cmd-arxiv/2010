is in X and N divides M, then N is in X. If all, say t, maximal monomials of X
have the same degree, then X is pure (of type t). A pure O-sequence is the
vector, h=(1,h_1,...,h_e), counting the monomials of X in each degree.
Equivalently, in the language of commutative algebra, pure O-sequences are the
h-vectors of monomial Artinian level algebras. Pure O-sequences had their
origin in one of Richard Stanley's early works in this area, and have since
played a significant role in at least three disciplines: the study of
simplicial complexes and their f-vectors, level algebras, and matroids. This
monograph is intended to be the first systematic study of the theory of pure
O-sequences. Our work, making an extensive use of algebraic and combinatorial
techniques, includes: (i) A characterization of the first half of a pure
O-sequence, which gives the exact converse to an algebraic g-theorem of Hausel;
(ii) A study of (the failing of) the unimodality property; (iii) The problem of
enumerating pure O-sequences, including a proof that almost all O-sequences are
pure, and the asymptotic enumeration of socle degree 3 pure O-sequences of type
t; (iv) The Interval Conjecture for Pure O-sequences (ICP), which represents
perhaps the strongest possible structural result short of an (impossible?)
characterization; (v) A pithy connection of the ICP with Stanley's matroid
h-vector conjecture; (vi) A specific study of pure O-sequences of type 2,
including a proof of the Weak Lefschetz Property in codimension 3 in
characteristic zero. As a corollary, pure O-sequences of codimension 3 and type
2 are unimodal (over any field); (vii) An analysis of the extent to which the
Weak and Strong Lefschetz Properties can fail for monomial algebras; (viii)
Some observations about pure f-vectors, an important special case of pure
O-sequences.

scattering on $^2$H, $^3$He, and $^4$He. We demonstrate that the strong
contributions to the pion-nucleus scattering lengths can be controlled
theoretically to an accuracy of a few percent for isoscalar nuclei and of 10%
for isovector nuclei. In particular, we find the $\pi$-$^3$He scattering length
to be $(62 \pm 4\pm 7)\times 10^{-3} m_{\pi}^{-1}$ where the uncertainties are
due to ambiguities in the $\pi$-N scattering lengths and few-nucleon effects,
respectively. To establish this accuracy we need to identify a suitable power
counting for pion-nucleus scattering. For this purpose we study the dependence
of the two-nucleon contributions to the scattering length on the binding energy
of $^2$H. Furthermore, we investigate the relative size of the leading two-,
three-, and four-nucleon contributions. For the numerical evaluation of the
pertinent integrals, aMonte Carlo method suitable for momentum space is
devised. Our results show that in general the power counting suggested by
Weinberg is capable to properly predict the relative importance of $N$-nucleon
operators, however, it fails to capture the relative strength of $N$- and
$(N+1)$-nucleon operators, where we find a suppression by a factor of 5
compared to the predicted factor of 50. The relevance for the extraction of the
isoscalar $\pi$-N scattering length from pionic $^2$H and $^4$He is discussed.
As a side result, we show that beyond the calculation of the $\pi$-$^2$H
scattering length is already beyond the range of applicability of heavy pion
effective field theory.

the BMC procedure on each of them individually, until we either find a bug, or
have systematically explored all interleavings. In the schedule recording
approach, we encode all possible interleavings into one single formula and then
exploit the high speed of the SMT solvers. In the underapproximation-widening

that our approaches can analyze larger problems and substantially reduce the

In speed and accuracy, our technique is competitive to existing approaches to
accelerate parameter estimation based on polynomial interpolation or neural
networks, while having some advantages over them. In our method, there is no
danger of creating unphysical wiggles as it can be the case for polynomial fits
of a high degree. Furthermore, we do not require a long training time as for
neural networks, but the construction of the interpolation is determined by the
time it takes to evaluate the likelihood at the sampling points, which can be
parallelised to an arbitrary degree. Our approach is completely general, and it
can adaptively exploit the properties of the underlying function. We can thus
apply it to any problem where an accurate interpolation of a function is

dynamics onto a quantum Hamiltonian, we argue that a dynamical glass transition
in the former must have a precise definition in terms of a quantum phase
transition in the latter. At the dynamical level, the transition corresponds to
a collapse of the excitation spectrum at a critical point. At the static level,
the transition affects the ground state wavefunction: while in some cases it
could be picked up by the expectation value of a local operator, in others the
order may be non-local, and impossible to be determined with any local probe.
Here we propose instead to use concepts from quantum information theory that
are not centered around local order parameters, such as fidelity and
entanglement measures. We show that for systems derived from the mapping of
classical stochastic dynamics, singularities in the fidelity susceptibility
translate directly into singularities in the heat capacity of the classical
system. In classical glassy systems with an extensive number of metastable
states, we find that the prefactor of the area law term in the entanglement
entropy jumps across the transition. We also discuss how entanglement measures
can be used to detect a growing correlation length that diverges at the
transition. Finally, we illustrate how static order can be hidden in systems
with a macroscopically large number of degenerate equilibrium states by
constructing a three dimensional lattice gauge model with only short-range

massively degenerate phase.

with or without particle inertia and sedimentation, is investigated. The
dynamics of non-inertial sedimenting particles is shown to be chaotic, under
the combined effect of gravity and of the circular displacement of the
vortices. This phenomenon is very sensitive to particle inertia, if any. By
using nearly hamiltonian dynamical system theory for the particle motion
equation written in the rotating reference frame, one can show that small
inertia terms of the particle motion equation strongly modify the Melnikov
function of the homoclinic trajectories and heteroclinic cycles of the
unperturbed system, as soon as the particle response time is of the order of
the settling time (Froude number of order unity). The critical Froude number
above which chaotic motion vanishes and a regular centrifugation takes place is
obtained from this Melnikov analysis and compared to numerical simulations.
Particles with a finite inertia, and in the absence of gravity, are not
necessarily centrifugated away from the vortex system. Indeed, these particles
can have various equilibrium positions in the rotating reference frame, like
the Lagrange points of celestial mechanics, according to whether their Stokes
number is smaller or larger than some critical value. An analytical stability
analysis reveals that two of these points are stable attracting points, so that
permanent trapping can occur for inertial particles injected in an isolated
co-rotating vortex pair. Particle trapping is observed to persist when

light curves and new radial velocity measurements for the target Cepheids to
determinate their distances and radii using the Baade-Wesselink technique. In
particular, we adopted the most recent calibration of the IR surface brightness
relation and of the projection factor. Moreover, we also provided accurate
measurements of the iron abundance of the target Cepheids. Current distance
estimates agree within one sigma with similar distances based either on
empirical or on theoretical NIR Period-Luminosity relations. However, the
uncertainties of the Baade-Wesselink distances are on average a factor of 3-4
smaller when compared with errors affecting other distance determinations. Mean
Baade-Wesselink radii also agree at one sigma level with Cepheid radii based
either on empirical or on theoretical Period-Radius relations. Iron abundances
are, within one sigma, similar to the iron contents provided by Andrievsky and
collaborators, thus confirming the super metal-rich nature of the target
Cepheids. We also found that the luminosity amplitudes of classical Cepheids,
at odds with RR Lyrae stars, do not show a clear correlation with the

the Hertzsprung progression together with the dependence of the topology of the

unit systems, Riemannian geometry is replaced by conformal geometry. Moreover
masses become geometric, appearing as Weyl weights of tractors (conformal
multiplets of fields necessary to keep local unit invariance manifest). The
relationship between these weights and masses is through the scalar curvature.
As a consequence mass terms are spacetime dependent for off-shell gravitational
backgrounds, but happily constant for physical, Einstein manifolds.
Unfortunately this introduces a naturalness problem because the scalar
curvature is proportional to the cosmological constant. By writing down tractor
stress tensors (multiplets built from the standard stress tensor and its first
and second derivatives), we show how back-reaction solves this naturalness
problem. We also show that classical back-reaction generates an interesting
potential for scalar fields. We speculate that a proper description of how
physical systems couple to scale, could improve our understanding of
naturalness problems caused by the disparity between the particle physics and
observed, cosmological constants. We further give some ideas how an ambient
description of tractor calculus could lead to a Ricci-flat/CFT correspondence
which generalizes the AdS side of Maldacena's duality to a Ricci-flat space of
one higher dimension.

stars in an OB association cannot be injected into protostellar cores with
enough efficiency. We then show that this SLR likely originated in a Wolf-Rayet

triggered the formation of the solar system. This scenario also accounts for

A simple toy model of a single donor-acceptor pair with spatially separated
chromophore sites allows to investigate the influence of these spatial
correlations on the quantum coherent excitation transfer. The sound velocity of
the solvent determines the wave lengths of the environmental modes, which, in
turn, has to be compared to the spatial distance of the chromophore sites. When
the wave length exceeds the distance between donor and acceptor site, we find
strong suppression of decoherence. In addition, we consider two spatially
separated donor-acceptor pairs under the influence of propagating environmental
modes. Depending on their wave lengths fixed by the sound velocity of the
solvent material, the spatial range of correlations may extend over typical
interpair distances, which can lead to an increase of the decohering influence
of the solvent. Surprisingly, this effect is counteracted by increasing
temperature.

obtained for closed populations, where the number of individuals does not
change during the whole duration of the epidemics. Here, we go one step further
and analyze, both analytically and numerically, a radically different kind of
diseases: those that are persistent and can last for an individual's lifetime.
To be more specific, we particularize to the case of Tuberculosis' (TB)
infection dynamics, where the infection remains latent for a period of time
before showing up and spreading to other individuals. We introduce an
epidemiological model for TB-like persistent infections taking into account the
heterogeneity inherent to the population structure. This sort of dynamics
introduces new analytical and numerical challenges that we are able to sort
out. Our results show that also for persistent diseases the epidemic threshold
depends on the ratio of the first two moments of the degree distribution so

introduction of a covariant basis, which makes the standard model approximate
symmetry structure manifest, leads to a physical and transparent picture of
flavor conversion processes. Our method is particularly useful to derive robust
bounds on models with arbitrary mechanisms of alignment. Known constraints on
flavor violation in the K and D systems are reproduced in a straightforward
manner. Assumptions-free limits, based on top flavor violation at the LHC, are
then obtained. In the absence of signal, with 100 fb^{-1} of data, the LHC will
exclude weakly coupled (strongly coupled) new physics up to a scale of 0.6 TeV
(7.6 TeV), while at present no general constraint can be set related to Delta
t=1 processes. LHC data will constrain Delta F=2 contributions via same-sign
tops signal, with a model independent exclusion region of 0.08 TeV (1.0 TeV).
However, in this case, stronger bounds are found from the study of CP violation
in D-bar D mixing with a scale of 0.57 TeV (7.2 TeV). In addition, we apply our
analysis to models of supersymmetry and warped extra dimension. The minimal
flavor violation framework is also discussed, where the formalism allows to
distinguish between the linear and generic non-linear limits within this class

76 % of the mass-energy of the universe, is obtained by requiring only that the
rigorous continuity equation (the Boltzmann transport equation) for quanta
propagating through space should have the form of a Lorentz-covariant and
dispersion-free wave equation. This requirement implies (i) properties of
space-time which an observer would describe as uniform expansion in agreement
with Hubble's law, and (ii) that the quantum transport behaves like in a
multiplicative medium with multiplication factor = 2. This inherent,
essentially explosive multiplicity of vacuum, thus caused by the requirement of
Lorentz-covariance, is suggested as a potential origin of dark energy. In
addition, it is shown (iii) that this requirement of Lorentz-covariant quantum

nature and origin of turbulence in coronal loops in the framework of the Parker
model for coronal heating. A coronal loop is studied via reduced
magnetohydrodynamics simulations in Cartesian geometry. A uniform and strong
magnetic field threads the volume between the two photospheric planes, where a
velocity field in the form of a 1D shear flow pattern is present. Initially the
magnetic field which developes in the coronal loop is a simple map of the
photospheric velocity field. This initial configuration is unstable to a
multiple tearing instability which develops islands with X and O points in the
plane orthogonal to the axial field. Once the nonlinear stage sets in the
system evolution is characterized by a regime of MHD turbulence dominated by
magnetic energy. A well developed power law in energy spectra is observed and
the magnetic field never returns to the simple initial state mapping the
photospheric flow. The formation of X and O points in the planes orthogonal to
the axial field allows the continued and repeated formation and dissipation of
small scale current sheets where the plasma is heated. We conclude that the
observed turbulent dynamics are not induced by the complexity of the pattern
that the magnetic field-lines footpoints follow but they rather stem from the
inherent nonlinear nature of the system.

(40-130) Myr at z=5 (z=7-8), implying an early (z>9.4) start of their star
formation activity; the specific star formation rate is almost independent of
galactic stellar mass. These objects are enriched rapidly with metals and
galaxies identified by HST/WFC3 (M_UV < -18) show metallicities ~0.1 Zsun even

are virtually dust-free, and none of them has an extinction larger than E(B-V)

populating the faint-end of the LF (M_UV < -16), which JWST will resolve up to
z=7.3. PopIII stars continue to form essentially at all redshifts; however, at
z=6 (z=10) the contribution of Pop III stars to the total galactic luminosity
is always less than 5% for M_UV < -17 (M_UV < -16). The typical high-z galaxies
closely resemble the GRB host galaxy population observed at lower redshifts,
strongly encouraging the use of GRBs to detect the first galaxies.

exactly fermionize a large family of quantum spin Hamiltonians in dimensions

original model by adding to it a collection of stand-alone free spins and to
use a combination of these auxiliary operators and the lattice spins to
construct a proper fermion representation of the physical Hamiltonian. The
transform is especially useful for lattice spin Hamiltonians, where two-spin
interactions of XY-type are either absent or exist only within one-dimensional
chains and where the chains are coupled via two-spin interactions of Ising
type, ring-exchange terms, or more general multi-spin interactions that involve
an even number of spin operators from each chain. Using the proposed
fermionization method we provide a simple argument suggesting that a spin

(1936) to study the origin of the deviations of the halo spin PDF from the

correlations between two quantities entering the definition of spin, namely the
ratio $J/M^{5/2}$ (which depends only on mass) and the total gravitational
binding energy $E$. To reach this conclusion, we have made usage of the results
deduced from two high spatial- and mass resolution simulations. Our simulations
cover a relatively small volume and produce a sample of more than 16.000
gravitationally bound halos, each traced by at least 300 particles. We verify
that our results are stable to different systematics, by comparing our results
with those derived by the GIF2 and by a more recent simulation performed by
Maccio' et al. We find that the spin probability distribution function shows
systematic deviations from a lognormal, at all redshifts z <= 1. These
deviations depend on mass and redshift: at small masses they change little with
redshift, and also the best lognormal fits are more stable. The J-M
relationship is well described by a power law of exponent $\alpha$ very near to
the linear theory prediction (alpha=5/3), but systematically lower than this at
z<= 0.3. We argue that the fact that deviations from a lognormal PDF are
present only for high-spin halos could point to a role of large-scale tidal
fields in the evolution of the spin PDF.

problem #CSP. A problem from #CSP is characterised by a constraint language,
which is a fixed, finite set of relations over a finite domain D. An instance
of the problem uses these relations to constrain the variables in a larger set.
Bulatov showed that the problem of counting the satisfying assignments of
instances of any problem from #CSP is either in polynomial time (FP) or is
#P-complete. His proof draws heavily on techniques from universal algebra and
cannot be understood without a secure grasp of that field. We give an
elementary proof of Bulatov's dichotomy, based on succinct representations,
which we call frames, of a class of highly structured relations, which we call
strongly rectangular. We show that these are precisely the relations which are
invariant under a Mal'tsev polymorphism. En route, we give a simplification of
a decision algorithm for strongly rectangular constraint languages, due to
Bulatov and Dalmau (2006). We establish a new criterion for the #CSP dichotomy,
which we call strong balance, and we prove that this property is decidable. In
fact, we establish membership in NP. Thus, we show that the dichotomy is
effective, resolving the most important open question concerning the #CSP
dichotomy.

unusual nonperturbative calculational tool in quantum field theory. The
objective was to expand the Green's functions of the quantum field theory as
Taylor series in powers of the space-time dimension D. In particular, the
vacuum energy for a massless \phi^{2N} (N=1,2,3,...) quantum field theory was
studied. The first two Taylor coefficients in this dimensional expansion were
calculated {\it exactly} and a set of graphical rules were devised that could
be used to calculate approximately the higher coefficients in the series. This
approach is mathematically valid and gives accurate results, but it has not
been actively pursued and investigated. Subsequently, in 1998 Bender and
Boettcher discovered that PT-symmetric quantum-mechanical Hamiltonians of the
form H=p^2+x^2(ix)^\epsilon, where \epsilon\geq0, have real spectra. These new
kinds of complex non-Dirac-Hermitian Hamiltonians define physically acceptable
quantum-mechanical theories. This result in quantum mechanics suggests that the
corresponding non-Dirac-Hermitian D-dimensional \phi^2(i\phi)^\epsilon quantum
field theories might also have real spectra. To examine this hypothesis, we
return to the technique devised in 1992 and in this paper we calculate the
first two coefficients in the dimensional expansion of the ground-state energy
of this complex non-Dirac-Hermitian quantum field theory. We show that to first
order in this dimensional approximation the ground-state energy is indeed real
for \epsilon\geq0.

Historically, cosmological simulations of disk galaxy formation have suffered
from a lack of resolution and a physically motivated feedback prescription.
Recent computational progress has allowed for unprecedented resolution, which
in turn allows for a more realistic treatment of feedback. These advances have
led to a new examination of gas accretion, evolution, and loss in the formation
of galaxy disks. Here I highlight the role that gas inflows, the regulation of
gas by feedback, and gas outflows play in achieving simulated disk galaxies

of interest in the astrophysical magnetic fields, their origin, and their
influence on the formation and evolution of astrophysical objects (stars,
galaxies, cooling flows). This growing interest is in part due to the fact that
it has become possible to trace magnetic fields in molecular clouds, over vast
extensions of the Milky Way and to study extragalactic magnetic fields,
including fields in clusters of galaxies. With the combination of various
techniques, such as Zeeman and Faraday rotation measurements with synchrotron
and aligned grain polarimetry, it is now possible to undertake quantitative
observational studies of magnetic fields, the results of which can be compared
with high resolution dynamo and MHD turbulence simulations. This brings the
field to a new stage.

energetic events. Localizations by the instruments on Fermi in combination with
follow-up by Swift provide accurate positions for observations at longer
wavelengths leading to the determination of redshifts, the true energy budget,
host galaxy properties and facilitate comparison with pre-Fermi bursts.
Multi-wavelength follow-up observations were performed on the afterglows of
four bursts with high energy emission detected by Fermi/LAT : GRB090323,
GRB090328, GRB090510 and GRB090902B. They were obtained in the
optical/near-infrared bands with GROND mounted at the MPG/ESO 2.2m telescope
and additionally of GRB090323 in the optical with the 2 m telescope in
Tautenburg, Germany. Three of the events are classified as long bursts while
GRB090510 is a well localized short GRB with GeV emission. In addition, host
galaxies were detected for three of the four bursts. Spectroscopic follow-up
was initiated with the VLT for GRB090328 and GRB090510. The afterglow
observations in 7 bands are presented for all bursts and their host galaxies
are investigated. Knowledge of the distance and the local dust extinction
enables comparison of the afterglows of LAT-detected GRBs with the general
sample. The spectroscopic redshifts of GRB090328 and GRB090510 were determined
to be z=0.7354+/-0.0003 and z=0.903 +/- 0.001 and dust corrected star-formation
rates of 4.8 Mdot yr^-1 and 0.60 M_dot yr^-1 were derived for their host
galaxies, respectively. The afterglows of long bursts exhibit power-law decay
indices alpha from less than 1 to ~2.3 and spectral indices (beta) values from
0.65 to ~1.2 which are fairly standard for GRB afterglows. Constraints are
placed on the jet half opening angles of less than 2.1 deg to greater than 6.4
deg which allows limits to be placed on the beaming corrected energies. These
range from less than 5x10^50 erg to the one of the highest values ever
recorded, greater than 2.2x10^52 erg for GRB090902B, and are not consistent
with a standard candle. The extremely energetic long Fermi bursts have optical
afterglows which lie in the top half of the brightness distribution of all
optical afterglows detected in the Swift era or even in the top 5% if
incompleteness is considered. The properties of the host galaxies of these LAT

distinct regions in the gas mass versus star formation (SF) rate plane, both
for the integrated quantities and for the respective surface densities. This
result is based on CO observations of galaxy populations at low and high
redshifts, and on the current consensus for the CO luminosity to gas mass
conversion factors. The data suggest the existence of two different star
formation regimes: a long-lasting mode for disks and a more rapid mode for
starbursts, the latter probably occurring during major mergers or in dense
nuclear SF regions. Both modes are observable over a large range of SF rates.
The detection of CO emission from distant near-IR selected galaxies reveals
such bimodal behavior for the first time, as they allow us to probe gas in disk
galaxies with much higher SF rates than are seen locally. The different regimes
can potentially be interpreted as the effect of a top-heavy IMF in starbursts.
However, we favor a different physical origin related to the fraction of
molecular gas in dense clouds. The IR luminosity to gas mass ratio (i.e., the
SF efficiency) appears to be inversely proportional to the dynamical (rotation)
timescale. Only when accounting for the dynamical timescale, a universal SF law
is obtained, suggesting a direct link between global galaxy properties and the
local SF rate.

local interactions among pedestrians. While most studies of crowd behavior
consider only interactions among isolated individuals, it turns out that up to
70% of people in a crowd are actually moving in groups, such as friends,
couples, or families walking together. These groups constitute medium-scale
aggregated structures and their impact on crowd dynamics is still largely
unknown. In this work, we analyze the motion of approximately 1500 pedestrian
groups under natural condition, and show that social interactions among group
members generate typical group walking patterns that influence crowd dynamics.
At low density, group members tend to walk side by side, forming a line
perpendicular to the walking direction. As the density increases, however, the
linear walking formation is bent forward, turning it into a V-like pattern.
These spatial patterns can be well described by a model based on social
communication between group members. We show that the V-like walking pattern
facilitates social interactions within the group, but reduces the flow because
of its ""non-aerodynamic"" shape. Therefore, when crowd density increases, the
group organization results from a trade-off between walking faster and
facilitating social exchange. These insights demonstrate that crowd dynamics is
not only determined by physical constraints induced by other pedestrians and
the environment, but also significantly by communicative, social interactions
among individuals.

control variable on the Hamiltonian equations of the geodesics. Motivated by
statistical modeling of spatiotemporal data, we also design a stochastic model
to deal with random shape evolutions. This model is closely related to the
spline model since the control variable previously introduced is set as a
random force perturbing the evolution. Although we focus on the finite

20% effect near threshold, and much less at higher energies. It is argued that
most likely, the absence of confinement resonances in Ce@C82+ is due primarily
to the finite thickness of the carbon cage; the off-the-center position and
thermal vibration of the encaged atom, discussed elsewhere, further weaken the
resonances rendering them beyond the sensitivity of the experiment to detect,
in this case. For other situations/endohedrals, the confinement resonances
should well be observable, and Ne@C60 is suggested as an excellent candidate.

with the tradeoff among rate, diversity and complexity of space-time block

featured as a group-orthogonal STBC by replacing every element of an Alamouti

coded symbols. With the PIC group decoding and a particular grouping scheme,
the proposed STBC can achieve full diversity, a rate of $(2M)/(M+2)$ and a
low-complexity decoding for $M$ transmit antennas. Simulation results show that
the proposed codes can achieve the full diversity with PIC group decoding while
requiring half decoding complexity of the existing codes.

Cloud computing providers are unable to predict geographic distribution of

  This paper presents vision, challenges, and architectural elements of

including: (1) Every weak filling of any planar contact manifold can be
deformed to a blow up of a Stein filling. (2) Contact manifolds that have fully
separating planar torsion are not weakly fillable - this gives many new
examples of contact manifolds without Giroux torsion that have no weak
fillings. (3) Weak fillability is preserved under splicing of contact manifolds
along symplectic pre-Lagrangian tori - this gives many new examples of contact
manifolds without Giroux torsion that are weakly but not strongly fillable.
  We establish the obstructions to weak fillings via two parallel approaches
using holomorphic curves. In the first approach, we generalize the original
Gromov-Eliashberg ""Bishop disk"" argument to study the special case of Giroux
torsion via a Bishop family of holomorphic annuli with boundary on an ""anchored
overtwisted annulus"". The second approach uses punctured holomorphic curves,
and is based on the observation that every weak filling can be deformed in a
collar neighborhood so as to induce a stable Hamiltonian structure on the
boundary. This also makes it possible to apply the techniques of Symplectic
Field Theory, which we demonstrate in a test case by showing that the
distinction between weakly and strongly fillable translates into contact
homology as the distinction between twisted and untwisted coefficients.

gravity, whose action does not contain time derivatives higher than the second
order. The Hamiltonian structure of this theory is studied in all the details
in the case of the spatially-flat FRW space-time, demonstrating many of the
features of the general theory. It is shown that, with some plausible
assumptions, including the projectability of the lapse function, this model is
consistent. As a large class of such theories, the modified HL $F(R)$ gravity
is introduced. The study of its ultraviolet properties shows that its $z=3$
version seems to be renormalizable in the same way as the original HL proposal.
The Hamiltonian analysis of the modified HL $F(R)$ gravity shows that it is in
general a consistent theory. The $F(R)$ gravity action is also studied in the
fixed-gauge form, where the appearance of a scalar field is particularly
illustrative. Then the spatially-flat FRW cosmology for this $F(R)$ gravity is
investigated. It is shown that a special choice of parameters for this theory
leads to the same equations of motion as in the case of traditional $F(R)$
gravity. Nevertheless, the cosmological structure of the modified HL $F(R)$
gravity turns out to be much richer than for its traditional counterpart. The
emergence of multiple de Sitter solutions indicates to the possibility of
unification of early-time inflation with late-time acceleration within the same
model. Power-law $F(R)$ theories are investigated in detail. It is analytically
shown that they have a quite rich cosmological structure: early/late-time
cosmic acceleration of quintessence, as well as of phantom types. Also it is
demonstrated that all the four known types of finite-time future singularities
may occur in the power-law HL $F(R)$ gravity. Finally, a covariant proposal for
(renormalizable) $F(R)$ gravity within the HL spirit is presented.

the exploration of $\tbart$ production and decay at the Tevatron and the LHC.
For this analysis we made a computer program that incorporates besides the NLO
QCD corrections to $\tbart$ production and decay also mixed weak-QCD
corrections to the production amplitudes, and that allows for studies of
correlated versus uncorrelated $\tbart$ events. In this paper we analyze and
compute observables mostly for dileptonic $\tbart$ final states to
next-to-leading order in the strong and weak gauge couplings (NLOW), with
selection cuts. We calculate charge asymmetries of the top quark and of
$\ell=e,\mu$ and we compare, where possible, with experimental results. We show
that top-quark spin correlations affect a leptonic pair asymmetry (which has
not been measured so far) by $\sim 7%$. We determine several dileptonic angular
correlations, which reflect $\tbart$ spin correlations, namely the beam,
off-diagonal and helicity correlation, and the opening angle distribution
(defined in the $t$, $\bar t$ rest frames) when selection cuts are applied. Our
NLOW predictions for the beam, off-diagonal, and helicity correlation for the
Tevatron agree with recent measurements by the CDF and D0 experiments. In
addition we make predictions for estimators of these correlations as functions
of $\mtt$. These estimators may prove useful for the Tevatron and also in the
early rounds of LHC data-analyses, where the event numbers will probably not be
abundant. Furthermore, we compute to NLOW in the gauge couplings two dilepton
angular correlations that are defined in the laboratory frame, for correlated
and uncorrelated $\tbart$ events at the LHC. Finally, based on our SM results,
we identify several observables that allow to search for non-standard parity-

BRs of the considered sixty two $B_c$ decays are in the range of $10^{-5}$ to
$10^{-9}$; (ii) since the behavior for $^1P_1$ meson is much different from

generally larger than that of $B_c \to A(^3P_1) (V, A(^3P_1))$ decays in the

sensitive to the values of the mixing angles, which will be tested by the

orthogonator. We discuss two different types of orthogonators, parallel
(intersection-based) and serial (demultiplexer-based) orthogonators. The last
one can be slower but it makes sequential logic design straightforward. We
propose generating a multidimensional logic hyperspace [Physics Letters A 373
(2009) 1928-1934] by using the zero-crossing events of uncorrelated Gaussian
electrical noises available in the chips. The spike trains in the hyperspace
are non-overlapping, and are referred to as neuro-bits. To demonstrate this
idea, we generate 3-dimensional hyperspace bases using 2 Gaussian noises as
sources for neuro-bits, respectively. In such a scenario, the detection of
different hyperspace basis elements may have vastly differing delays. We show
that it is possible to provide an identical speed for all the hyperspace bases
elements using correlated noise sources, and demonstrate this for the 2
neuro-bits situations. The key impact of this paper is to demonstrate that a
logic design approach using such neuro-bits can yield a fast, low power
processing and environmental variation tolerant means of designing computer
circuitry. It also enables the realization of multi-valued logic, significantly
increasing the complexity of computer circuits by allowing several neuro-bits
to be transmitted on a single wire.

that dopant atoms play an important role both in vortex pinning and in

spatial variations of the dopant atom density on the scale of a few dozen to
