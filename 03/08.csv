entries of any column of the constraint matrix are equal. Such programs capture
capacitated versions of covering problems. In this paper, we study the
approximability of CCIPs, in particular, their relation to the integrality gaps
of the underlying 0,1-CIP.
  If the underlying 0,1-CIP has an integrality gap O(gamma), and assuming that
the integrality gap of the priority version of the 0,1-CIP is O(omega), we give
a factor O(gamma + omega) approximation algorithm for the CCIP. Priority
versions of 0,1-CIPs (PCIPs) naturally capture quality of service type
constraints in a covering problem.
  We investigate priority versions of the line (PLC) and the (rooted) tree
cover (PTC) problems. Apart from being natural objects to study, these problems
fall in a class of fundamental geometric covering problems. We bound the
integrality of certain classes of this PCIP by a constant. Algorithmically, we
give a polytime exact algorithm for PLC, show that the PTC problem is APX-hard,
and give a factor 2-approximation algorithm for it.

  Algorithms","In the Proceedings of WINE 2010",,,,"cs.DS cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Constrained submodular maximization problems have long been studied, with
near-optimal results known under a variety of constraints when the submodular
function is monotone. The case of non-monotone submodular maximization is less
understood: the first approximation algorithms even for the unconstrainted
setting were given by Feige et al. (FOCS '07). More recently, Lee et al. (STOC
'09, APPROX '09) show how to approximately maximize non-monotone submodular
functions when the constraints are given by the intersection of p matroid
constraints; their algorithm is based on local-search procedures that consider
p-swaps, and hence the running time may be n^Omega(p), implying their algorithm
is polynomial-time only for constantly many matroids. In this paper, we give
algorithms that work for p-independence systems (which generalize constraints
given by the intersection of p matroids), where the running time is poly(n,p).
Our algorithm essentially reduces the non-monotone maximization problem to
multiple runs of the greedy algorithm previously used in the monotone case.
  Our idea of using existing algorithms for monotone functions to solve the
non-monotone case also works for maximizing a submodular function with respect
to a knapsack constraint: we get a simple greedy-based constant-factor
approximation for this problem.
  With these simpler algorithms, we are able to adapt our approach to
constrained non-monotone submodular maximization to the (online) secretary
setting, where elements arrive one at a time in random order, and the algorithm
must make irrevocable decisions about whether or not to select each element as
it arrives. We give constant approximations in this secretary setting when the
algorithm is constrained subject to a uniform matroid or a partition matroid,
and give an O(log k) approximation when it is constrained by a general matroid
of rank k.

Au junctions at room temperature and ambient conditions. We observe noise
suppression at up to three conductance quanta, with possible indications of
current-induced local heating and $1/f$ noise in the contact region at high

black hole Sgr A* has been carried out in order to address two important
issues: one concerns the underluminous nature of Sgr A* with its bolometric
luminosity being several orders of magnitude less than those of its more
massive counterparts. It turns out that the angular momentum of the ionized
stellar winds from orbiting stars in one or two disks orbiting Sgr A* could be
a critical factor in estimating accurately the accretion rate unto Sgr A*. A
net angular momentum of ionized gas feeding Sgr A* could lower the Bondi rate.
Furthermore, the recent time delay picture of the peak flare emission can be
understood in the context of adiabatic expansion of hot plasma. The expansion
speed of the plasma is estimated to be sub-relativistic. However, relativistic
bulk motion of the plasma could lead to outflow from Sgr A*. Significant
outflow from Sgr A* could then act as a feedback which could then reduce Bondi
accretion rate. These uncertain factors can in part explain the underluminous
nature of Sgr A*. The other issue is related to the emission mechanism and the
cause of flare activity in different wavelength bands. Modeling of X-ray and
near-IR flares suggests that inverse Compton scattering (ICS) of IR flare
photons by the energetic electrons responsible for the submm emission can
account for the X-ray flares. A time delay of minutes to tens of minutes is
predicted between the peak flaring in the near-IR and X-rays, NOT due to
adiabatic expansion of optically thick hot plasma, but to the time taken for IR
flare photons to cross the accretion flow before being upscattered.

$({0.55}^{+0.13+0.02}_{-0.11-0.01}) \mathrm{SNu}r h^{2}$ ($\mathrm{SNu}x =

respectively, where the quoted errors are statistical and systematic,
respectively. The SN rate for early-type galaxies is found to be

$({0.49}^{+0.15+0.02}_{-0.11-0.01})$ $\mathrm{SNu}r h^{2}$ in C4 and maxBCG

for C4 and maxBCG clusters. The SN rate in galaxy clusters as a function of
redshift...shows only weak dependence on redshift. Combining our current

a linear function of redshift, and find $r_{L} = $ $[(0.49^{+0.15}_{-0.14}) +$

possible evidence for an enhancement of the SN rate in the cores of cluster
early-type galaxies... we estimate the fraction of cluster SNe that are

time scale of few picoseconds (ps) after ultrafast pulsed laser excitation. The
velocity of lattice contraction depended on the laser fluence. Furthermore, the
lattice contraction is followed by large, non-thermal, lattice expansion of
several picometers (pm) after few hundreds of ps. These results were
interpreted based on the position of the (0014) diffraction spot in the
glancing angle diffraction geometry off the graphite surface using ultrafast
electron diffraction (UED). The lattice contraction and expansion corresponded
to upward and downward movements of the diffraction spot respectively. Here, we
show that ultrafast pulsed laser excitation of graphite produces large
transient electric fields (TEFs). The TEFs deflect the electron beam in a
manner similar to these reported and the neglect of TEFs likely led to

with chemotaxis is introduced and simulation results are compared with
numerical solutions of the model equations. The model equations developed here

approach. The objective is to achieve predictability and to preserve key
atomic-scale features that underlie the formation and stability of the
composite structures. We start with an all-atom description, the Liouville
equation, and the order parameters characterizing nanoscale features of the
system. An equation of Smoluchowski type for the stochastic dynamics of the
order parameters is derived from the Liouville equation via a multiscale
perturbation technique. The self-assembly of composite structures from
nanocomponents with internal atomic structure is analyzed and growth rates are
derived. Applications include the assembly of a viral capsid from capsomers, a
ribosome from its major subunits, and composite materials from fibers and
nanoparticles. Our approach overcomes errors in other coarse-graining methods
which neglect the influence of the nanoscale configuration on the atomistic
fluctuations. We account for the effect of order parameters on the statistics
of the atomistic fluctuations which contribute to the entropic and average
forces driving order parameter evolution. This approach enables an efficient
algorithm for computer simulation of self-assembly, whereas other methods
severely limit the timestep due to the separation of diffusional and complexing
characteristic times. Given that our approach does not require recalibration
with each new application, it provides a way to estimate assembly rates and
thereby facilitate the discovery of self-assembly pathways and kinetic dead-end
structures.

Sun-like stars differ so significantly despite the superficial similarities of
stellar parameters. We carried out a comprehensive analysis of 118 solar
analogs and reported that a close connection exists between the Li abundance
A_Li and the line-broadening width (v_r+m; mainly contributed by rotational
effect), which led us to conclude that stellar rotation may be the primary
control of the surface Li content. To examine our claim in more detail, we
study whether the degree of stellar activity exhibits a similar correlation
with the Li abundance, which is expected because of the widely believed close
connection between rotation and activity. We measured the residual flux at the
line center of the strong Ca II 8542 line, r_0(8542), known to be a useful
index of stellar activity, for all sample stars using newly acquired spectra in
this near-IR region. The projected rotational velocity (v_e sin i) was
estimated by subtracting the macroturbulence contribution from v_r+m that we
had already established. A remarkable (positive) correlation was found in the
A_Li versus (vs.) r_0(8542) diagram as well as in both the r_0(8542) vs. v_e
sin i and A_Li vs. v_e sin i diagrams, as had been expected. With the
confirmation of rotation-dependent stellar activity, this clearly shows that
the surface Li abundances of these solar analogs progressively decrease as the
rotation rate decreases. Given this observational evidence, we conclude that
the depletion of surface Li in solar-type stars, probably caused by effective
envelope mixing, operates more efficiently as stellar rotation decelerates. It
may be promising to attribute the low-Li tendency of planet-host G dwarfs to
their different nature in the stellar angular momentum.

parameters along its edges. It is shown that the sign of the flow parameters
can be determined iteratively as function of the initial moduli, without
explicit calculation of the flow of the moduli in the tree. Using this result,
an indefinite quadratic form, which appears in the expression for the D4-D2-D0
BPS mass in the large volume limit, is proven to be positive definite for flow
trees with 3 or less endpoints. The contribution of these flow trees to the BPS

behavior of large heterogeneous ensembles subject to ecological forces like
dispersal remains a central challenge for mathematicians and biological
scientists alike. Over the past century, specific attention has been directed
to the role played by dispersal in shaping plant communities, or on the
dynamics of marine open-ocean and intertidal systems, or on biological
invasions, or on the spread of disease, to name a few. Mathematicians and
theoreticians, starting with the efforts of researchers that include Aronson,
Fisher, Kolmogorov, Levin, Okubo, Skellam, Slobodkin, Weinberger and many
others, set the foundation of a fertile area of research at the interface of
ecology, mathematics, population biology and evolutionary biology.
Integrodifference systems, the subject of this manuscript, arise naturally in
the study of the spatial dispersal of organisms whose local population dynamics
are prescribed by models with discrete generations. The brunt of the
mathematical research has focused on the the study of existence traveling wave
solutions and characterizations of the spreading speed particularly, in the
context of cooperative systems. In this paper, we characterize the spreading
speed for a large class of non cooperative systems, all formulated in terms of
integrodifference equations, by the convergence of initial data to wave
solutions. In this setting, the spreading speed is characterized as the slowest
speed of a family of non-constant traveling wave solutions. Our results are
applied to a specific non-cooperative competition system in detail.

dynamics --- the model generates patterns, such as distribution of population
sizes, practically identical to those obtained in the presence of habitat
preference, provided an higher immigration rate is considered. Notwithstanding
the similarity in the population distribution, we show that invasibility

the neutral model results results more invasible or less invasible depending on
whether the comparison is made at equal immigration rate or at equal

antiproton beam, the most promising being spin filtering, the theoretical
understanding of which is currently incomplete. The method of polarization
buildup by spin filtering requires many of the beam particles to remain within
the beam after repeated interaction with an internal target in a storage ring.
Hence small scattering angles, where we show that electromagnetic effects
dominate hadronic effects, are important. All spin-averaged and spin-dependent
electromagnetic cross-sections and spin observables for elastic spin 1/2 - spin
1/2 scattering, for both point-like particles and non-point-like particles with
internal structure defined by electromagnetic form factors, are derived to
first order in QED. Particular attention is paid to spin transfer and
depolarization cross-sections in antiproton-proton, antiproton-electron and
positron-electron scattering, in the low | t | region of momentum transfer. A
thorough mathematical treatment of spin filtering is then presented,
identifying the key physical processes involved and highlighting the dynamical
properties of the physical system. We present and solve sets of differential
equations which describe the buildup of polarization by spin filtering in many
different scenarios of interest. The advantages of using a lepton target are
outlined, and finally a proposal to polarize antiprotons by spin filtering off
an opposing polarized electron beam is investigated.

that each vertex v \in V hosts a processor. The processors are allowed to
communicate only with their neighbors in G. The communication is synchronous,
i.e., it proceeds in discrete rounds. In the distributed vertex coloring
problem the objective is to color G with Delta + 1, or slightly more than Delta
+ 1, colors using as few rounds of communication as possible. (The number of
rounds of communication will be henceforth referred to as running time.)
Efficient randomized algorithms for this problem are known for more than twenty
years \cite{L86, ABI86}. Specifically, these algorithms produce a (Delta +
1)-coloring within O(log n) time, with high probability. On the other hand, the
best known deterministic algorithm that requires polylogarithmic time employs
O(Delta^2) colors. This algorithm was devised in a seminal FOCS'87 paper by
Linial \cite{L87}. Its running time is O(log^* n). In the same paper Linial
asked whether one can color with significantly less than Delta^2 colors in
deterministic polylogarithmic time. By now this question of Linial became one
of the most central long-standing open questions in this area. In this paper we
answer this question in the affirmative, and devise a deterministic algorithm
that employs \Delta^{1 +o(1)} colors, and runs in polylogarithmic time.
Specifically, the running time of our algorithm is O(f(Delta) log Delta log n),
for an arbitrarily slow-growing function f(Delta) = \omega(1). We can also
produce O(Delta^{1 + \eta})-coloring in O(log Delta log n)-time, for an
arbitrarily small constant \eta > 0, and O(Delta)-coloring in
O(Delta^{\epsilon} log n) time, for an arbitrarily small constant \epsilon > 0.

In the formalism, emphasis is put on the study of the final state interaction
(FSI) effects of $p$ and $\Lambda$ with the recoiling nucleus. We include
elastic scattering and single nucleon knock-out (KO) channels in the FSI.
Calculations are presented for the $^{12}$C nucleus, using shell model wave

the nucleus. Calculated results are presented for the angular correlation
distribution between $p$ and $\Lambda$, their invariant mass distribution and
the momentum spectra of $p$ and $\Lambda$. These results are compared with the
corresponding experimental measurements \cite{agnello}. With only elastic
scattering FSI included, the angular correlation distribution and the momentum
spectra are found to be in good accord with the corresponding measurements.
With full FSI the calculated $p\,\Lambda$ invariant mass distribution is found
to have two peaks, one corresponding to the elastic scattering FSI and another
to single nucleon KO FSI. The KO peak agrees fully, in position and shape, with
the peak observed in Ref. \cite{agnello}. The peak corresponding to elastic
scattering FSI does not seem to exist in the measured distribution. Considering
that such a two peak structure is always seen in the inclusive ($p$, $p^\prime

exclusive pseudoscalar and scalar final states and apply it to $B \to D \, l \,

point-like mesons (with some structure-dependent corrections), which is valid
in the low-energy region of the photons and whose results we extrapolate over
the complete phase space. The largest quantifiable uncertainty is due to the
approximative matching to the Standard Model. In addition unknown
structure-dependent contributions and model dependencies might have an impact

of the Boltzmann transport equation within quantum field theory. We work within
the specific model of a hermitian, scalar field with polynomial
self-interaction in two-dimensional Minkowski space. Our main results are as
follows: Firstly, that one can obtain a non-perturbative, exact
integro-differential equation for the number densities, which we called the
pre-Boltzmann equation. We secondly take the long-time-dilute-medium limit of
this equation, to obtain a simpler equation. This limiting equation is
qualitatively similar to the Boltzmann equation, but it involves additional
re-scattering terms. These terms disappear if perform a perturbation expansion
in the coupling constant and ignore the loop corrections (Born approximation).
If loop corrections are included, then we argue that for consistency, one must
also keep corresponding rescattering terms which are normally ignored. Our
analysis is hence of potential relevance for physical applications of the
Boltzmann equation wherein loop effects are essential, such as in the standard
scenario of baryogensis in the Early Universe. Our analysis is performed in the
context of flat spacetime, but in such a way that the main ingredients can be
transferred, straightforwardly to the case of a curved spacetime of
Robertson-Walker-type. Our main technical tools are methods from constructive
quantum field theory, as well as a general method called ""projection
technique"". This turns out to give convergent expansions, and a rather elegant
way of organizing the combinatorics of the various quantum field theoretic
expansions in the analysis.

the dynamics follows the anomalous diffusion law $ x(t) \sim \xi(F) \
t^{\mu(F)} $. The anomalous exponent $0<\mu(F)<1$ and the correlation length
$\xi(F)$ vary continuously with $F$. In the limit of vanishing force $F \to 0$,
we measure the following power-laws : the anomalous exponent vanishes as
$\mu(F) \propto F^a$ with $a \simeq 0.6$ (instead of $a=1$ in dimension $d=1$),
and the correlation length diverges as $\xi(F) \propto F^{-\nu}$ with $\nu

thus that the dynamics renormalizes onto an effective directed trap model,
where the traps are characterized by a typical length $\xi(F)$ along the

these traps are 'smaller' in linear size and in depth than in dimension $d=1$,

acknowledging the primary role played by the total stress-energy-momentum

constitutive theory to assign preferred status to particular parts of this
total tensor, when defined with respect to a particular splitting. The
relevance of tensors, associated with the electromagnetic fields that appear in
Maxwell's equations for polarizable media, to the forces and torques that they
induce has been a debated since Minkowski, Einstein and Abraham considered
these issues over a century ago. Consistency with the laws of Newtonian
continuum mechanics demands that the total force density on any element of a
medium be proportional to the local linear acceleration field of that element
in an inertial frame and must also arise as part of the divergence of the total
stress-energy-momentum tensor. The fact that, unlike the tensor proposed by
Minkowski, the divergence of the Abraham tensor depends explicitly on the local
acceleration field of the medium as well as the electromagnetic field, sets it
apart from many other terms in the total stress-energy-momentum tensor for a
medium. We explore how electromagnetic forces or torques on moving media can be
defined in terms of a particular 3-form on spacetimes that exhibit particular
Killing symmetries. It is shown how the forms associated with translational
Killing vector fields lead to explicit expressions for the electromagnetic
force densities in stationary media subject to the Minkowski constitutive
relations. These are compared with other models involving polarizable media in
electromagnetic fields that have been considered in the recent literature.

class of perfectly insulating media. The distinction between the notions of
""classical photons"" in homogeneous bounded and unbounded stationary media and
in stationary unbounded magneto-electric media is pointed out in the context of
the Abraham, Minkowski and symmetrized Minkowski electromagnetic
stress-energy-momentum tensors. Such notions have led to intense debate about
the role of these (and other) tensors in describing electromagnetic
interactions in moving media. In order to address some of these issues for
material subject to the Minkowski constitutive relations, the propagation of
harmonic waves through homogeneous and inhomogeneous, isotropic plane-faced
slabs at rest is first considered. To motivate the subsequent analysis on
accelerating media two classes of electromagnetic modes that solve Maxwell's
equations for uniformly rotating homogeneous polarizable media are enumerated.
Finally it is shown that, under the influence of an incident monochromatic,
circularly polarized, plane electromagnetic wave, the Abraham and symmetrized
Minkowski tensors induce different time-averaged torques on a uniformly
rotating materially inhomogeneous dielectric cylinder. We suggest that this
observation may offer new avenues to explore experimentally the covariant
electrodynamics of more general accelerating media.

rate, total infrared luminosities, and specific star formation rates (sSFR) for
our HCG sample, to samples of isolated galaxies and interacting pairs and find
that overall there is no discernible difference among them. However, HCGs which
can be considered as dynamically ""old"", host late-type galaxies with a slightly
lower sSFR than the one found in dynamically ""young"" groups. This could be
attributed to multiple past interactions among the galaxies in old groups, that
have led to the build up of their stellar mass. It is also consistent with our

|E_k-E_0|^{s-1}$ with $s \ne 1$. We find that irrespective of model details
there is a universal generalized Wigner time $t_0$ that characterizes the
evolution of the survival probability $P_0(t)$. The generic decay behavior
which is implied by rate equation phenomenology is a slowing down stretched
exponential, reflecting the gradual resolution of the bandprofile. But
depending on non-universal features of the model a power-law decay might take
over: it is only for an Ohmic coupling to the continuum that we get a robust
exponential decay that is insensitive to the nature of the intra-continuum
couplings. The analysis highlights the co-existence of perturbative and
non-perturbative features in the dynamics. It turns out that there are special
circumstances in which $t_0$ is reflected in the spreading process and not only
in the survival probability, contrary to the naive linear response theory
expectation.

requires the transport of substantial magnetic energy and helicity flux through
the photosphere concomitant with the eruption. Under the magnetohydrodynamics
approximation, these fluxes are produced by twisting magnetic field and/or flux
emergence in the photosphere. A CME trajectory, observed 2000 September 12 and
fitted with a flux-rope model constrains energy and helicity budgets for
testing the flux-injection hypothesis. Optimal velocity profiles for several
driving scenarios are estimated by minimizing the photospheric plasma
velocities for a cylindrically symmetric flux-rope magnetic field subject to
the flux budgets required by the flux-rope model. Ideal flux injection,
involving only flux emergence, requires hypersonic upflows in excess of the
solar escape velocity 617 km/s over an area of 6x10^8 km^2 to satisfy the
energy and helicity budgets of the flux-rope model. These estimates are
compared with magnetic field and Doppler measurements from Solar Heliospheric
Observatory/Michelson Doppler Imager on 2000 September 12 at the footpoints of
the CME. The observed Doppler signatures are insufficient to account for the
required energy and helicity budgets of the flux-injection hypothesis.

experiments with ultracold atomic gases. They have been used in experiments on
diverse topics such as low-dimensional quantum gases, cavity quantum
electrodynamics, atom-surface interactions, and chip-based atomic clocks and
interferometers. A severe limitation of atom chips, however, is that techniques
to control atomic interactions and to generate entanglement have not been
experimentally available so far. Such techniques enable chip-based studies of
entangled many-body systems and are a key prerequisite for atom chip
applications in quantum simulations, quantum information processing, and
quantum metrology. Here we report experiments where we generate multi-particle
entanglement on an atom chip by controlling elastic collisional interactions
with a state-dependent potential. We employ this technique to generate
spin-squeezed states of a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate and show that
they are useful for quantum metrology. The observed 3.7 dB reduction in spin
noise combined with the spin coherence imply four-partite entanglement between
the condensate atoms and could be used to improve an interferometric
measurement by 2.5 dB over the standard quantum limit. Our data show good
agreement with a dynamical multi-mode simulation and allow us to reconstruct
the Wigner function of the spin-squeezed condensate. The techniques
demonstrated here could be directly applied in chip-based atomic clocks which
are currently being set up.

dynamics as given by Bekenstein in the beginning is restated, with a rigid
proof, in a different form akin to the statement of the second law of
thermodynamics given by Clausius. The various physical possibilities and
implications of this statement are discussed therein. This paper is a mere
venture into the restricted second law of blackhole dynamics pertaining to
blackholes emitting Hawking radiation. The paper thus considers a didactically
interesting reformulation of the second law of blackhole thermodynamics after
some revisions.
