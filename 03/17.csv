For gamma t, the inclusion of the top quark decay in the matrix element reveals
an striking result: the largest contribution to the final state, e.g. gamma l
nu b, with l = e, mu, tau, does not result from gq -> gamma t -> gamma l nu b

belong to the same class. We find that 99 % of the galaxies can be assigned to
only 17 major classes, with 11 additional minor classes including the remaining
1%. The classification is not unique since many galaxies appear in between
classes, however, our rendering of the algorithm overcomes this weakness with a
tool to identify borderline galaxies. Each class is characterized by a template
spectrum, which is the average of all the spectra of the galaxies in the class.
These low noise template spectra vary smoothly and continuously along a
sequence labeled from 0 to 27, from the reddest class to the bluest class. Our
Automatic Spectroscopic K-means-based (ASK) classification separates galaxies
in colors, with classes characteristic of the red sequence, the blue cloud, as
well as the green valley. When red sequence galaxies and green valley galaxies
present emission lines, they are characteristic of AGN activity. Blue galaxy
classes have emission lines corresponding to star formation regions. We find
the expected correlation between spectroscopic class and Hubble type, but this
relationship exhibits a high intrinsic scatter. Several potential uses of the
ASK classification are identified and sketched, including fast determination of
physical properties by interpolation, classes as templates in redshift
determinations, and target selection in follow-up works (we find classes of
Seyfert galaxies, green valley galaxies, as well as a significant number of
outliers). The ASK classification is publicly accessible through various

images reveal that while the IRDCs remain dark, many of the cores are
associated with bright 24um emission sources, which suggests that they contain
one or more embedded protostars. Combining the 24um, 60-100um, and
sub-millimeter continuum data, we have constructed broadband spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) for 157 of the cores within these IRDCs and, using simple
gray-body fits to the SEDs, have estimated their dust temperatures,
emissivities, opacities, bolometric luminosities, masses and densities. Based
on their Spitzer/IRAC 3-8um colors and the presence of 24um point source
emission, we have separated cores that harbor active, high-mass star formation
from cores that are quiescent. The active `protostellar' cores typically have
warmer dust temperatures and higher bolometric luminosities than the more
quiescent, perhaps `pre-protostellar', cores. Because the mass distributions of
the populations are similar, however, we speculate that the active and
quiescent cores may represent different evolutionary stages of the same
underlying population of cores. Although we cannot rule out low-mass
star-formation in the quiescent cores, the most massive of them are excellent
candidates for the `high-mass starless core' phase, the very earliest in the
formation of a high-mass star.

setting of using one classical channel to simulate another exactly, and in the
presence of various resources that are all classes of non-signalling
correlations: Shared randomness, shared entanglement and arbitrary
non-signalling correlations. Specifically, when the channel being simulated is
noiseless, this reduces to the zero-error capacity of the channel, assisted by
the various classes of non-signalling correlations. When the resource channel
is noiseless, it results in the ""reverse"" problem of simulating a noisy channel
exactly by a noiseless one, assisted by correlations. In both cases, 'one-shot'
separations between the power of the different assisting correlations are
exhibited. The most striking result of this kind is that entanglement can
assist in zero-error communication, in stark contrast to the standard setting
of communicaton with asymptotically vanishing error in which entanglement does
not help at all. In the asymptotic case, shared randomness is shown to be just
as powerful as arbitrary non-signalling correlations for noisy channel
simulation, which is not true for the asymptotic zero-error capacities. For
assistance by arbitrary non-signalling correlations, linear programming
formulas for capacity and simulation are derived, the former being equal (for
channels with non-zero unassisted capacity) to the feedback-assisted zero-error
capacity originally derived by Shannon to upper bound the unassisted zero-error
capacity. Finally, a kind of reversibility between non-signalling-assisted
capacity and simulation is observed, mirroring the famous ""reverse Shannon
theorem"".

galaxy in a dark matter halo to infer the scaling relations between halo mass
and central galaxy properties. Using galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey, we investigate the halo mass-luminosity relation (MLR) and the halo
mass-stellar mass relation (MSR) of central galaxies. In particular, we focus
on the dependence of these scaling relations on the colour of the central
galaxy. We find that red central galaxies on average occupy more massive haloes
than blue central galaxies of the same luminosity. However, at fixed stellar
mass there is no appreciable difference in the average halo mass of red and
blue centrals, especially for M* $\lsim$ 10^{10.5} h^{-2} Msun. This indicates
that stellar mass is a better indicator of halo mass than luminosity.
Nevertheless, we find that the scatter in halo masses at fixed stellar mass is
non-negligible for both red and blue centrals. It increases as a function of
stellar mass for red centrals but shows a fairly constant behaviour for blue
centrals. We compare the scaling relations obtained in this paper with results
from other independent studies of satellite kinematics, with results from a
SDSS galaxy group catalog, from galaxy-galaxy weak lensing measurements, and
from subhalo abundance matching studies. Overall, these different techniques
yield MLRs and MSRs in fairly good agreement with each other (typically within
a factor of two), indicating that we are converging on an accurate and reliable
description of the galaxy-dark matter connection. We briefly discuss some of
the remaining discrepancies among the various methods.

degrees in polarization angles. For 73 of 86 sources we detect polarization at
least once. The degrees of polarization are as high as ~19%, with the median
over all sources being ~4%. Source fluxes and polarizations are typically
highly variable, with fractional variabilities up to ~60%. We find that BLLac
sources have on average the highest level of polarization. There appears to be
no correlation between degree of polarization and redshift, indicating that
there has been no substantial change of polarization properties since z~2.4.

Theories separately describing each of these mechanisms were discussed long

lack of any obvious static symmetry distinguishing the metal from the insulator
poses another fundamental problem, since an appropriate static order parameter
cannot be easily found. More recent work, however, has revisited the original
arguments of Anderson and Mott, which stressed that the key diference between
the metal end the insulator lies in the dynamics of the electron. This physical
picture has suggested that the ""typical"" (geometrically averaged) escape rate
from a given lattice site should be regarded as the proper dynamical order
parameter for the MIT, one that can naturally describe both the Anderson and
the Mott mechanism for localization. This article provides an overview of the

the category of modules over the algebra $C^*$ (with convolution product) with
the category of comodules over $C$. It is based on the pairing of the algebra
$C^*$ with the coalgebra $C$ provided by the evaluation map $\ev:C^*\ot_R C\to

endofunctors $T$ and $G$ on any category $\A$ as a map, natural in $a,b\in \A$,
$$\beta_{a,b}:\A(a, G(b)) \to \A(T(a),b),$$ and we call it {\em rational} if

construct a {\em rational functor} as the functor-part of an idempotent comonad

"1003.3223","John Gustafson","John R. Gustafson","Wolfgang Pauli 1900 to 1930: His Early Physics in Jungian Perspective",,,,,"physics.hist-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Wolfgang Pauli's philosophy and physics were intertwined. His philosophy was
a variety of Platonism, in which Pauli's affiliation with Carl Jung formed an
integral part, but Pauli's philosophical explorations in physics appeared
before he met Jung. Jung validated Pauli's psycho-philosophical perspective.
Thus, the roots of Pauli's physics and philosophy are important in the history
of modern physics. In his early physics, Pauli attempted to ground his
theoretical physics in positivism. He then began instead to trust his intuitive
visualizations of entities that formed an underlying reality to the sensible
physical world. These visualizations included holistic kernels of
mathematical-physical entities that later became for him synonymous with Jung's
mandalas. I have connected Pauli's visualization patterns in physics during the
period 1900 to 1930 to the psychological philosophy of Jung and displayed some
examples of Pauli's creativity in the development of quantum mechanics. By
looking at Pauli's early physics and philosophy, we gain insight into Pauli's
contributions to quantum mechanics. His exclusion principle, his influence on
Werner Heisenberg in the formulation of matrix mechanics, his emphasis on firm
logical and empirical foundations, his creativity in formulating electron
spinors, his neutrino hypothesis, and his dialogues with other quantum
physicists, all point to Pauli being the dominant genius in the development of
quantum theory. Because Pauli was in a difficult individuation process during
his early years, his own writings on philosophy tend to be sparse and often
contradictory. My analysis of Pauli's physics and philosophy is based upon
published and unpublished sources, and Pauli's later reflections. A pattern has
emerged. Pauli changed his mind from relying on high rationality and
empiricism, to valuing intuitive metaphysical visualizations. This coupled with
disturbing events in his life precipitated a breakdown and led Pauli to seek
treatment at the Jung Clinic. Pauli's psychological tension diminished after
1932. His physics consistently involved symmetry and invariants. His philosophy
allied with Jung's resembled a Platonism of combined psyche and physics. Pauli
sought a rational unification and foundation for his philosophy, but that goal
was cut short by his untimely death at the age of 58.

such constraints and it allows for values of $W$ form factors similar to those

simulation. Pockets of hot, diffuse gas around individual OB associations sweep
up thick shells of material that persist for long times due to the cooling
instability. The overlapping of high-pressure, rarefied regions leads to a
collective central outflow that escapes the galaxy by eating away at the
exterior gas through turbulent mixing, rather than gathering it into a thin,
unstable shell. Supersonic, turbulent gas naturally avoids dense regions where
turbulence decays quickly and cooling times are short, and this further
enhances density contrasts throughout the galaxy- leading to a complex, chaotic
distribution of bubbles, loops and filaments as observed in NGC 1569 and other

that it is possible to infer the spectral states of X-ray binaries from these
simple models and thereby constrain the properties of the source. Of the eight
LMXBs studied, three reside within globular clusters, and one is a confirmed
field source. Due to the nature of the luminosity cut all sources are either
neutron star binaries emitting at or above the Eddington luminosity or black
hole binaries. The spectra from these sources are well described by
single-component models, with parameters consistent with Galactic LMXB
observations, where hard-state sources have a range in photon index of 1.5-1.9
and thermally dominated sources have inner disc temperatures between ~0.7-1.55
keV. The large variability observed in the brightest globular cluster source
(LX>4E38 erg/s) suggests the presence of a black hole binary. At its most
luminous this source is observed in a thermally dominated state with kT=1.5
keV, consistent with a black hole mass of ~4 Msol. This observation provides
further evidence that globular clusters are able to retain such massive
binaries. We also observed a source transitioning from a bright state (LX~1E39
erg/s), with prominent thermal and non-thermal components, to a less luminous
hard state (LX=3.8E38 erg/s, Gamma=1.85). In its high flux emission this source

using smoothing lengths of 10 h^{-1} Mpc and 15 h^{-1} Mpc, we find filament
lengths per unit volume of 1.9x10^{-3} h^2 Mpc^{-2} and 7.6x10^{-4} h^2
Mpc^{-2}, respectively. The filament width distributions, which are much more
sensitive to non-linear growth, are also consistent between the real and mock
galaxy distributions using a standard cosmology. In SDSS, we find mean filament
widths of 5.5 h^{-1} Mpc and 8.4 h^{-1} Mpc on 10 h^{-1} Mpc and 15 h^{-1} Mpc
smoothing scales, with standard deviations of 1.1 h^{-1} Mpc and 1.4 h^{-1}
Mpc, respectively. Finally, the spatial distribution of filamentary structure
in simulations is very similar between z=3 and z=0 on smoothing scales as large
as 15 h^{-1} Mpc, suggesting that the outline of filamentary structure is
already in place at high redshift.

distribution offers the opportunity to reduce the cosmic variance error in the
measurement of certain cosmological parameters. We develop a formalism that
includes bias non-linearities and stochasticity. Our formalism is general
enough that can be used to optimise survey design and tracers selection and
optimally split (or combine) tracers to minimise the error on the
cosmologically interesting quantities. Our approach generalises the one
presented by McDonald & Seljak (2009) of circumventing sample variance in the
measurement of $f\equiv d \ln D/d\ln a$. We analyse how the bias, the noise,
the non-linearity and stochasticity affect the measurements of $Df$ and explore
in which signal-to-noise regime it is significantly advantageous to split a
galaxy sample in two differently-biased tracers. We use N-body simulations to
find realistic values for the parameters describing the bias properties of dark
matter haloes of different masses and their number density.
  We find that, even if dark matter haloes could be used as tracers and
selected in an idealised way, for realistic haloes, the sample variance limit
can be reduced only by up to a factor $\sigma_{2tr}/\sigma_{1tr}\simeq 0.6$.
This would still correspond to the gain from a three times larger survey volume
if the two tracers were not to be split. Before any practical application one
should bear in mind that these findings apply to dark matter haloes as tracers,
while realistic surveys would select galaxies: the galaxy-host halo relation is
likely to introduce extra stochasticity, which may reduce the gain further.

morphological types, mass ratios, orbital configurations, etc. On one side,
these simulations have to be run in a cosmological context, able to provide a
large number of galaxy pairs, with boundary conditions given by the large-scale
simulations, on the other side the resolution has to be high enough at galaxy
scales, to provide realistic physics. The GalMer database is a library of
thousands simulations of galaxy mergers at moderate spatial resolution and it
is a compromise between the diversity of initial conditions and the details of
underlying physics. We provide all coordinates and data of simulated particles

the simulations directly to observations: stellar population modelling, dust
extinction, spectra, images, visualisation using dedicated VO tools. The GalMer

nearby radio galaxy Centaurus A. We image in detail (with a resolution down to
7"", ~100pc) the distribution of HI along the dust lane. Our data have better
velocity resolution and better sensitivity than previous observations. The HI
extends for a total of ~15kpc. The data, combined with a titled-ring model of
the disk, allow to conclude that the kinematics of the HI is that of a
regularly rotating, highly warped structure down to the nuclear scale. The
parameters (in particular the inclination) of our model are somewhat different
from some of the previously proposed models but consistent with what was
recently derived from stellar light in a central ring. The model nicely
describes also the morphology of the dust lane as observed with Spitzer. There
are no indications that large-scale anomalies in the kinematics exist that
could be related to supplying material for the AGN. Large-scale radial motions
do exist, but these are only present at larger radii r>6kpc). This unsettled
gas is mainly part of a tail/arm like structure. The relatively regular
kinematics of the gas in this structure suggests that it is in the process of
settling down into the main disk. The presence of this structure further
supports the merger/interaction origin of the HI in Cen A. From the structure
and kinematics we estimate a timescale of 1.6-3.2*10^{8}yr since the merging
event. No bar structure is needed to describe the kinematics of the HI. The
comparison of the timescale derived from the large-scale HI structure and those
of the radio structure together with the relative regularity of the HI down to
the sub-kpc regions does not suggest a one-to-one correspondence between the
merger and the phase of radio activity. Interestingly, the radial motions of
the outer regions are such that the projected velocities are redshifted
compared to the regular orbits. This means that the blueshifted absorption
discovered earlier and discussed in our previous paper cannot be caused by
out-moving gas at large radius projected onto the centre. Therefore, the
interpretation of the blueshifted absorption, together with at least a fraction
of the redshifted nuclear absorption, as evidence for a regular inner disk,
still holds. Finally, we also report the discovery of two unresolved clouds
detected at 5.2 and 11kpc away (in projection) from the HI disk. They are
likely an other example of left-over of the merger that brought the HI gas.

which results in deterioration of the Higgs searches but the deviations of the

radiation assume the collision of dilute accelerated particles with a cold,
dense target plasma, neglecting interactions of the fast particles with each
other. This is inadequate for situations where collisions with this background
plasma are not completely dominant, as may be the case in, for example,
low-density coronal sources. We aim to formulate a model of a self-interacting,
entirely fast electron population in the absence of a dense background plasma,
to investigate its implications for observed bremsstrahlung spectra and the
flare energy budget. We derive approximate expressions for the time-dependent
distribution function of the fast electrons using a Fokker-Planck approach. We
use these expressions to generate synthetic bremsstrahlung X-ray spectra as
would be seen from a corresponding coronal source. We find that our model
qualitatively reproduces the observed behaviour of some flares. As the flare
progresses, the model's initial power-law spectrum is joined by a lower energy,
thermal component. The power-law component diminishes, and the growing thermal
component proceeds to dominate the total emission over timescales consistent
with flare observations. The power-law exhibits progressive spectral hardening,
as is seen in some flare coronal sources. We also find that our model requires
a factor of 7 - 10 fewer accelerated electrons than the cold, thick target
model to generate an equivalent hard X-ray flux. This model forms the basis of
a treatment of self-interactions among flare fast electrons, a process which
affords a more efficient means to produce bremsstrahlung photons and so may
reduce the efficiency requirements placed on the particle acceleration
mechanism. It also provides a useful description of the thermalisation of fast
electrons in coronal sources.

irradiated by strong X-rays produced in the inner most part of the disk. As
expected, the irradiation heats the photosphere and drives a thermal wind. To
apply our results to the well-studied X-ray transient source GRO J1655-40, we
adopted the observed mass of its black hole, and the observed properties of its
X-ray radiation. To compare the results with the observations, we also computed
transmitted X-ray spectra based on the wind solution. Our main finding is: the
density of the fast moving part of the wind is more than one order of magnitude
lower than that inferred from the observations. Consequently, the model fails
to predict spectra with line absorption as strong and as blueshifted as those
observed. However, despite the thermal wind being weak and Compton thin, the
ratio between the mass-loss rate and the mass accretion rate is about seven.
This high ratio is insensitive to the accretion luminosity, in the limit of
lower luminosities. Most of the mass is lost from the disk between 0.07 and 0.2
of the Compton radius. We discovered that beyond this range the wind solution
is self-similar. In particular, soon after it leaves the disk, the wind flows
at a constant angle with respect to the disk. Overall, the thermal winds
generated in our comprehensive simulations do not match the wind spectra
observed in GRO J1655-40. This supports the conclusion of Miller et al. and
Kallman et al. that the wind in GRO J1655-40, and possibly other X-ray
transients, may be driven by magnetic processes. This in turn implies that the
disk wind carries even more material than our simulations predict and as such
has a very significant impact on the accretion disk structure and dynamics.

consistent with electroweak precision data (including the B \rightarrow K \pi\
CP asymmetries) we obtain a Higgs mass of the order of a few hundreds GeV and a

Renormalization Group (RG) equations, finding similar allowed values for the
Higgs mass but a slightly lower cut-off due to the breaking of the perturbative
regime. Such low cut-off means that the effects of new physics needed to
describe electroweak interactions at energy above \Lambda\ should be measurable
at the LHC. We use the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model

electroweak symmetry breaking by radiative corrections and containing new

baryons lie in a hot halo around galaxies. We establish observationally
motivated constraints on the mass and radii of these haloes using a variety of
independent arguments. First, the observed dispersion measure of pulsars in the
Large Magellanic Cloud allows us to constrain the hot halo around the Milky
Way: if it obeys the standard NFW profile, it must contain less than 4-5% of
the missing baryons from the Galaxy. This is similar to other upper limits on
the Galactic hot halo, such as the soft X-ray background and the pressure
around high velocity clouds. Second, we note that the X-ray surface brightness
of hot haloes with NFW profiles around large isolated galaxies is high enough
that such emission should be observed, unless their haloes contain less than
10-25% of their missing baryons. Third, we place constraints on the column
density of hot haloes using nondetections of OVII absorption along AGN
sightlines: in general they must contain less than 70% of the missing baryons
or extend to no more than 40 kpc. Flattening the density profile of galactic
hot haloes weakens the surface brightness constraint so that a typical L$_*$
galaxy may hold half its missing baryons in its halo, but the OVII constraint
remains unchanged, and around the Milky Way a flattened profile may only hold
$6-13%$ of the missing baryons from the Galaxy ($2-4 \times 10^{10}
M_{\odot}$). We also show that AGN and supernovae at low to moderate redshift -
the theoretical sources of winds responsible for driving out the missing
baryons - do not produce the expected correlations with the baryonic
Tully-Fisher relationship and so are insufficient to explain the missing
baryons from galaxies. We conclude that most of missing baryons from galaxies
do not lie in hot haloes around the galaxies, and that the missing baryons
never fell into the potential wells of protogalaxies in the first place. They
may have been expelled from the galaxies as part of the process of galaxy
formation.

circuit using the mechanism of DNA strand displacement. The design is scalable:
all species of DNA strands can in principle be mixed and prepared in a single
test tube, rather than requiring separate purification of each species, which
is a barrier to large-scale synthesis. The design is time-responsive: the
concentration of output species changes in response to the concentration of
input species, so that time-varying inputs may be continuously processed. The
design is digital: Boolean values of wires in the circuit are represented as
high or low concentrations of certain species, and we show how to construct a
single-input, single-output signal restoration gate that amplifies the
difference between high and low, which can be distributed to each wire in the
circuit to overcome signal degradation. This means we can achieve a digital
abstraction of the analog values of concentrations. Finally, the design is
energy-efficient: if input species are specified ideally (meaning absolutely 0
concentration of unwanted species), then output species converge to their ideal
concentrations at steady-state, and the system at steady-state is in (dynamic)
equilibrium, meaning that no energy is consumed by irreversible reactions until
the input again changes.
  Drawbacks of our design include the following. If input is provided
non-ideally (small positive concentration of unwanted species), then energy
must be continually expended to maintain correct output concentrations even at
steady-state. In addition, our fuel species - those species that are
permanently consumed in irreversible reactions - are not ""generic""; each gate
in the circuit is powered by its own specific type of fuel species. Hence
different circuits must be powered by different types of fuel. Finally, we
require input to be given according to the dual-rail convention, so that an
input of 0 is specified not only by the absence of a certain species, but by
the presence of another. That is, we do not construct a ""true NOT gate"" that
sets its output to high concentration if and only if its input's concentration
is low. It remains an open problem to design scalable, time-responsive,
digital, energy-efficient molecular circuits that additionally solve one of
these problems, or to prove that some subset of their resolutions are mutually
incompatible.

system may have an intermediate scale in which the phonon dispersion is
softened, but it manages finally to become increasingly rigid over large

behavior, with an effective rigidity that becomes pinned in practice at very
small values, implying a very large susceptibility for the development of a

biclusters of its samples and of the features which are used for representing
the samples. Consistent biclusterings allow to obtain correct classifications
of the samples from the known classification of the features, and vice versa,
and they are very useful for performing supervised classifications. The problem
of finding consistent biclusterings can be seen as a feature selection problem,
where the features that are not relevant for classification purposes are
removed from the set of data, while the total number of features is maximized
in order to preserve information. This feature selection problem can be
formulated as a linear fractional 0-1 optimization problem. We propose a
reformulation of this problem as a bilevel optimization problem, and we present
a heuristic algorithm for an efficient solution of the reformulated problem.

reproduce this result without reference to the Evans function by using direct

the advantage of applying also in the more general multi-periodic setting where
no conveniently computable Evans function is yet devised. In particular, we
complement the picture of modulational stability described by Bronski and
Johnson by analyzing the projectors onto the total eigenspace bifurcating from
the origin in a neighborhood of the origin and zero Floquet parameter. We show
the resulting linear system is equivalent, to leading order and up to
conjugation, to the Whitham system and that, consequently, the characteristic
polynomial of this system agrees (to leading order) with the linearized

Oscillation (QPO) in the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer data of the black hole

to vary on timescales between $\sim$100 s and days, correlated with the count
rate contribution from the optically thick accretion disk: we studied this
correlation and discuss its influence on the QPO width. In all observations,
the quality factors ($\nu_0$/FWHM) of the fundamental and second harmonic peaks
were observed to be consistent, suggesting that the quasi-periodic nature of
the oscillation is due to frequency modulation. In addition to the QPO and its
harmonic peaks, a new 1.5$\nu$ component was detected in the power spectra.
This component is broad, with a quality factor of $\sim$0.6. From this, we
argue what the peak observed at half the QPO frequency, usually referred to as
""sub-harmonic"" could be the fundamental frequency, leading to the sequence
1:2:3:4. We also studied the energy dependence of the timing features and
conclude that the two continuum components observed in the power spectrum,
although both more intense at high energies, show a different dependence on
energy. At low energies, the lowest-frequency component dominates, while at
high energies the higher-frequency one has a higher fractional rms. An
interplay between these two components was also observed as a function of their
characteristic frequency. In this source, the transition between low/hard state
and hard-intermediate state appears to be a smooth process.

foundational in the field of discrete geometry and is a powerful model in the
material and biological sciences. As packing problems retreat from the reach of
solution by analytic constructions, the importance of an efficient numerical
method for conducting \textit{de novo} (from-scratch) searches for dense
packings becomes crucial. In this paper, we use the \textit{divide and concur}
framework to develop a general search method for the solution of periodic
constraint problems, and we apply it to the discovery of dense periodic
packings. An important feature of the method is the integration of the unit
cell parameters with the other packing variables in the definition of the
configuration space. The method we present led to improvements in the
densest-known tetrahedron packing which are reported in [arXiv:0910.5226].
Here, we use the method to reproduce the densest known lattice sphere packings
and the best known lattice kissing arrangements in up to 14 and 11 dimensions
respectively (the first such numerical evidence for their optimality in some of
these dimensions). For non-spherical particles, we report a new dense packing
of regular four-dimensional simplices with density $\phi=128/219\approx0.5845$
and with a similar structure to the densest known tetrahedron packing.

considered as the most promising way to solve several kinds of problems
relating either to cooperative work especially where involved collaborators are
dispersed geographically or to some very greedy applications which require
enough power of computing or/and storage. Such environments can be classified
into two categories; first, dedicated grids where the federated computers are
solely devoted to a specific work through its end. Second, Volunteer grids
where federated computers are not completely devoted to a specific work but
instead they can be randomly and intermittently used, at the same time, for any
other purpose or they can be connected or disconnected at will by their owners
without any prior notification. Each category of grids includes surely several
advantages and disadvantages; nevertheless, we think that volunteer grids are
very promising and more convenient especially to build a general multipurpose
distributed scalable environment. Unfortunately, the big challenge of such
environments is, however, security and trust. Indeed, owing to the fact that
every federated computer in such an environment can randomly be used at the
same time by several users or can be disconnected suddenly, several security
problems will automatically arise. In this paper, we propose a novel solution
based on identity federation, agent technology and the dynamic enforcement of
access control policies that lead to the design and implementation of trusted

under the influence of a central star. It is known that the system with more
than two planets becomes unstable after remaining quasi-stable for long times,
leading to highly eccentric orbital motions or ejections of some of the
planets. In this paper, we are concerned with the underlying physics for this
quasi-stability as well as the subsequent instability and advocate the
so-called ""stagnant motion"" in the phase space, which has been explored in the
field of dynamical system. We employ the Lyapunov exponent, the power spectra
of orbital elements and the distribution of the durations of quasi-stable
motions to analyze the phase space structure of the three-planet system, the
simplest and hopefully representative one that shows the instability. We find
from the Lyapunov exponent that the system is almost non-chaotic in the initial
quasi-stable state whereas it becomes intermittently chaotic thereafter. The
non-chaotic motions produce the horizontal dense band in the action-angle plot
whereas the voids correspond to the chaotic motions. We obtain power laws for
the power spectra of orbital eccentricities. Power-law distributions are also
found for the durations of quasi-stable states. All these results combined
together, we may reach the following picture: the phase space consists of the
so-called KAM tori surrounded by satellite tori and imbedded in the chaotic
sea. The satellite tori have a self-similar distribution and are responsible
for the scale-free power-law distributions of the duration times. The system is
trapped around one of the KAM torus and the satellites for a long time (the
stagnant motion) and moves to another KAM torus with its own satellites from
time to time, corresponding to the intermittent chaotic behaviors.

self-similar solutions in which a primordial black hole is attached to an exact
or asymptotically Friedmann model for an equation of state of the form
$p=(\gamma-1)\rho c^2$. In the positive pressure case ($1 < \gamma < 2$), there
is no such solution when the black hole is attached to an exact Friedmann
background via a sonic point. However, it has been claimed that there is a
one-parameter family of asymptotically Friedmann black hole solutions providing
the ratio of the black hole size to the cosmological horizon size is in a
narrow range above some critical value. There are also ""universal"" black holes
in which the black hole has an apparent horizon but no event horizon. It turns
out that both these types of solution are only asymptotically {\it
quasi}-Friedmann, because they contain a solid angle deficit at large
distances, but they are not necessarily excluded observationally.
  We also consider the possibility of self-similar black hole solutions in a
universe dominated by a scalar field. If the field is massless, the situation
resembles the stiff fluid case, so any black hole solution is again contrived,
although there may still be universal black hole solutions. The situation is
less clear if the scalar field is rolling down a potential and therefore
massive, as in the quintessence scenario. Although no explicit asymptotically
Friedmann black hole solutions of this kind are known, they are not excluded
and comparison with the $0 < \gamma < 2/3$ perfect fluid case suggests that
they should exist if the black hole is not too large. This implies that a black
hole might grow as fast as the cosmological horizon in a quintessence-dominated
universe in some circumstances, supporting the proposal that accretion onto
primordial black holes may have played a role in the production of the
supermassive black holes in galactic nuclei.

non-axisymmetric perturbations in the vertical direction as due to a tidal
encounter, and show that the density distribution near the disc mid-plane has a
strong impact on the radius beyond which distortions like warps develop. The
self-gravity of the disc resists distortion in the inner parts. Applying this
approach to a galactic disc with an exponential vertical profile, Saha & Jog
showed that warps develop beyond 4-6 disc scalelengths, which could hence be
only seen in HI. The real galactic discs, however, have less steep vertical
density distributions that lie between a sech and an exponential profile. Here
we calculate the disc response for such a general sech^(2/n) density
distribution, and show that the warps develop from a smaller radius of 2-4 disc
scalelengths. This naturally explains why most galaxies show stellar warps that
start within the optical radius. Thus a qualitatively different picture of
ubiquitous optical warps emerges for the observed less-steep density profiles.
The surprisingly strong dependence on the density profile is due to the fact
that the disc self-gravity depends crucially on its mass distribution close to
the mid-plane. General results for the radius of onset of warps, obtained as a
function of the disc scalelength and the vertical scaleheight, are presented as
contour plots which can be applied to any galaxy.

the hard-core limit of the model, which allows us to study the effects of the
confining potential by exact and very accurate numerical results. We analyze
the quantum critical behaviors in the large trap-size limit within the
framework of the trap-size scaling (TSS) theory, which introduces a new trap
exponent theta to describe the dependence on the trap size. This study is
relevant for experiments of confined quasi 1D cold atom systems in optical
lattices. At the low-density Mott transition TSS can be shown analytically
within the spinless fermion representation of the hard-core limit. The
trap-size dependence turns out to be more subtle in the other critical regions,
when the corresponding homogeneous system has a nonzero filling f, showing an
infinite number of level crossings of the lowest states when increasing the
trap size. At the n=1 Mott transition this gives rise to a modulated TSS: the
TSS is still controlled by the trap-size exponent theta, but it gets modulated
by periodic functions of the trap size. Modulations of the asymptotic power-law
behavior is also found in the gapless superfluid region, with additional
multiscaling behaviors.

The model is based on the native structure of the proteins that consitute the
capsids and is described in terms of the C-alpha atoms. Nanoindentation by a
large tip is modeled as compression between parallel plates. Plots of the
compressive force versus plate separation for CCMV are qualitatively consistent
with continuum models and experiments, showing an elastic region followed by an
irreversible drop in force. The mechanical response of CPMV has not been
studied, but the molecular model predicts an order of magnitude higher
stiffness and a much shorter elastic region than for CCMV. These large changes
result from small structural changes that increase the number of bonds by only
30% and would be difficult to capture in continuum models. Direct comparison of
local deformations in continuum and molecular models of CCMV shows that the
molecular model undergoes a gradual symmetry breaking rotation and accommodates
more strain near the walls than the continuum model. The irreversible drop in
force at small separations is associated with rupturing nearly all of the bonds
between capsid proteins in the molecular model while a buckling transition is
observed in continuum models.

interesting target for asteroseismic studies. This work is devoted to the
determination of the internal metallicity of this star, linked with its
$\lambda$ Bootis nature (i.e., solar surface abundances of light elements, and
subsolar surface abundances of heavy elements), taking advantage of its
$\gamma$ Doradus pulsations. This is the most accurate way to obtain this
information, and this is the first time such a study is performed for a
planetary-system-host star. We have used the equilibrium code CESAM and the
non-adiabatic pulsational code GraCo. We have applied the Frequency Ratio
Method (FRM) and the Time Dependent Convection theory (TDC) to estimate the
mode identification, the Brunt-Va\""is\""al\""a frequency integral and the mode
instability, making the selection of the possible models. When the
non-seismological constraints (i.e its position in the HR diagram) are used,
the solar abundance models are discarded. This result contradicts one of the
main hypothesis for explaining the $\lambda$ Bootis nature, namely the
accretion/diffusion of gas by a star with solar abundance. Therefore, according
to these results, a revision of this hypothesis is needed. The inclusion of
accurate internal chemical mixing processes seems to be necessary to explain
the peculiar abundances observed in the surface of stars with internal subsolar
metallicities. The use of the asteroseismological constraints, like those
provided by the FRM or the instability analysis, provides a very accurate
determination of the physical characteristics of HR 8799. However, a dependence
of the results on the inclination angle $i$ still remains. The determination of
this angle, more accurate multicolour photometric observations, and high
resolution spectroscopy can definitively fix the mass and metallicity of this
star.

generalized from a neo-institutional model of networks to a neo-evolutionary

neo-evolutionary model enables us to appreciate both organizational integration

attending legislation. The specification of innovation systems in terms of
nations, sectors, cities, and regions can then be formulated as empirical
questions: is synergy generated among functions in networks of relations? This
Triple Helix model enables us to study the knowledge base of an urban economy
in terms of a trade-off between locally stabilized and (potentially locked-in)
trajectories versus the techno-economic and cultural development regimes which
work with one more degree of freedom at the global level. The meta-stabilizing
potentials of urban technologies between these two levels can be used
reflexively as the intelligence of a creative reconstruction making cities

the accretion disk spectrum. This is due to the combination of very low
absorbing column density along this line of sight which allows the shape of the
disk emisison to be constrained at low energies by the CCD's, while the tail
can be simultaneously determined up to 30 keV by the high energy detectors.
These data clearly demonstrate that the observed disk spectrum is broader than
a simple 'sum of blackbodies', and relativistic smearing of the emission is
strongly required. However, the intrinsic emission should be more complex than
a (color-corrected) sum of blackbodies as it should also contain photo-electric
absorption edges from the partially ionised disk photosphere. These are
broadened by the relativistic smearing, but the models predict ~ 3-5 per cent
deviations for 1/3- 1 solar abundance around the edge energies, significantly
stronger than observed. This indicate that the models need to include more
physical processes such as self-irradiation, bound-bound (line) absorption,
and/or emission from recombination continuua and/or lines. Alternatively, if
none of these match the data, it may instead require that the accretion disk
density and/or emissivity profile with height is different to that assumed.
Thus these data demonstrate the feasibility of observational tests of our
fundamental understanding of the vertical structure of accretion disks.

It
provides a theoretical framework widely used in particle physics and condensed
matter physics. One of the most distinct features of quantum physics with
respect to classical physics is entanglement or the existence of strong
correlations between subsystems that can even be spacelike separated. In
quantum fields, observables restricted to a region of space define a subsystem.
While there are proofs on the existence of local observables that would allow a
violation of Bell's inequalities in the vacuum states of quantum fields as well
as some explicit but technically demanding schemes requiring an extreme
fine-tuning of the interaction between the fields and detectors, an
experimentally accessible entanglement witness for quantum fields is still
missing. Here we introduce smeared field operators which allow reducing the
vacuum to a system of two effective bosonic modes. The introduction of such
collective observables is motivated by the fact that no physical probe has
access to fields in single spatial (mathematical) points but rather smeared
over finite volumes. We first give explicit collective observables whose
correlations reveal vacuum entanglement in the Klein-Gordon field. We then show
that the critical distance between the two regions of space above which two
effective bosonic modes become separable is of the order of the Compton
wavelength of the particle corresponding to the massive Klein-Gordon field.

damping the self-trapping oscillations, and the nonlinearity introduces a
strong sensitivity to the initial conditions in the decay of the normalization.

according to a renewal process and have service and patience times that are
drawn from two independent sequences of independent, identically distributed
random variables. Customers enter service in the order of arrival and are
assumed to abandon the queue if the waiting time in queue exceeds the patience
time. The state of the system with $N$ servers is represented by a
four-component process that consists of the forward recurrence time of the
arrival process, a pair of measure-valued processes, one that keeps track of
the waiting times of customers in queue and the other that keeps track of the
amounts of time customers present in the system have been in service and a
real-valued process that represents the total number of customers in the
system. Under general assumptions, it is shown that the state process is a
Feller process, admits a stationary distribution and is ergodic. It is also
shown that the associated sequence of scaled stationary distributions is tight,
and that any subsequence converges to an invariant state for the fluid limit.
In particular, this implies that when the associated fluid limit has a unique
invariant state, then the sequence of stationary distributions converges, as
$N\rightarrow \infty$, to the invariant state. In addition, a simple example is
given to illustrate that, both in the presence and absence of abandonments, the
$N\rightarrow \infty$ and $t\rightarrow \infty$ limits cannot always be
interchanged.

found to produce important effects on the Kondo resonance of the interacting

renormalization group analysis to a finite-U multi-impurity Anderson

single-particle levels of the side dots are tuned towards the Fermi level and
""squeeze"" the Kondo resonance, accompanied by a strong drop in the Kondo
temperature, due to the presence of a supertunneling state. Further, we show
that the Kondo temperature vanishes in the limit of the Dicke effect of the
structure. By analyzing the magnetic moment and entropy of the three-dot
cluster versus temperature, we identify a different local singlet that competes
with the Kondo state, resulting in the eventual suppression of the Kondo
temperature and strongly affecting the spin correlations of the structure. We
further show that system asymmetries in couplings, level structure or due to
Coulomb interactions, result in interesting changes in the spectral function

Runge-Kutta algorithm, better than the split-step approximation limited by the
step size. As a result, the step size of RK4IP can have the same order of
magnitude as the dispersion length and/or the nonlinear length of the fiber,
provided the birefringence effect is small. For communication fibers with
random birefringence, the step size of RK4IP can be orders of magnitude larger
than the correlation length and the beating length of the fibers, depending on
the interaction between linear and nonlinear effects. Our approach can be
applied to the fibers having the general form of local birefringence and treat
the Kerr nonlinearity without approximation. For the systems with realistic
parameters, the RK4IP results are consistent with those using Manakov-PMD

>_{\Delta u - \Delta d}), and transversity, (< 1 >_{\delta u - \delta d}), as
well as an unrenormalized twist-3 coefficient, (d_1). The ratio of the momentum
to helicity fractions, (< x >_{u-d}/< x >_{\Delta u - \Delta d}), does not show
dependence on the light quark mass and agrees well with the value obtained from
experiment. Their respective absolute values, fully renormalized, show
interesting trends toward their respective experimental values at the lightest
quark mass. A prediction for the transversity, (0.7 < < 1 >_{\delta u -\delta
d} < 1.1), in the (\bar{\rm MS}) scheme at 2 GeV is obtained. The twist-3
coefficient, (d_1), though yet to be renormalized, supports the perturbative

realizations for practical single-photon sources because of their long-time
stable emission at room temperature. The popular nitrogen-vacancy center shows
single-photon emission, but within a large, phonon-broadened spectrum (~100nm),
which strongly limits its applicability for quantum communication. By contrast,
Ni-related centers exhibit narrow emission lines at room temperature. We
present investigations on single color centers consisting of Ni and Si created
by ion implantation into single crystalline IIa diamond. We use systematic
variations of ion doses between 10^8/cm^2 and 10^14/cm^2 and energies between
30keV and 1.8MeV. The Ni-related centers show emission in the near infrared
spectral range (~770nm to 787nm) with a small line-width (~3nm FWHM). A
measurement of the intensity correlation function proves single-photon
emission. Saturation measurements yield a rather high saturation count rate of
77.9 kcounts/s. Polarization dependent measurements indicate the presence of
two orthogonal dipoles.

for this reason it is very important to have an efficient method that scales
well with respect to particle numbers. We describe several existing methods
that have appeared in the literature, pointing out their limitations
particularly in the setting of large systems. We introduce a method for direct
computation of expectations via Chebyshev polynomials (DEC) based on evaluation
of a trace formula combined with expansion in modified Chebyshev polynomials.
This reduction is highly efficient and does not destroy any information. We
demonstrate the practical application of the scheme for a nuclear spin system
and compare with several alternatives, focusing on the performance of the
various methods with increasing system dimension. Our method may be applied to
autonomous quantum problems where the desired outcome of quantum simulation,
rather than being a full description of the system dynamics, is only the
expectation value of some given observable.

Relationships between four common notions of stability are described.
Specifically, we consider rate stability, mean rate stability, steady state

random events and control actions that can be implemented over time to affect
arrivals and service at the queues. The control actions also generate a vector
of additional network attributes. We characterize the network capacity region,
being the closure of the set of all rate vectors that can be supported subject
to network stability and to additional time average attribute constraints. We
show that (under mild technical assumptions) the capacity region is the same
under all four stability definitions. Our capacity achievability proof uses the
drift-plus-penalty method of Lyapunov optimization, and provides full details
for the case when network states obey a decaying memory property, which holds
for finite state ergodic systems and more general systems.

gravitational instabilities in protoplanetary disks around solar-type stars by
performing two simulations that are identical in all respects except the
treatment of the star. In one simulation, the star is assumed to remain fixed
at the center of the inertial reference frame. In the other, stellar motion is
handled properly by including an indirect potential in the hydrodynamic
equations to model the star's reference frame as one which is accelerated by
star/disk interactions. The disks in both simulations orbit a solar mass star,
initially extend from 2.3 to 40 AU with a r^-1/2 surface density profile, and
have a total mass of 0.14 M_sun. The gamma = 5/3 ideal gas is assumed to cool
everywhere with a constant cooling time of two outer rotation periods.
  The overall behavior of the disk evolution is similar, except for weakening
in various measures of GI activity by about at most tens of percent for the
indirect potential case. Overall conclusions about disk evolution in earlier
papers by our group, where the star was always assumed to be fixed in an
inertial frame, remain valid. There is no evidence for independent one-armed
instabilities, like SLING, in either simulation. On the other hand, the stellar
motion about the system center of mass (COM) in the simulation with the
indirect potential is substantial, up to 0.25 AU during the burst phase, as GIs
initiate, and averaging about 0.9 AU during the asymptotic phase, when the GIs
reach an overall balance of heating and cooling. These motions appear to be a
stellar response to nonlinear interactions between discrete global spiral modes
in both the burst and asymptotic phases of the evolution, and the star's
orbital motion about the COM reflects the orbit periods of disk material near
the corotation radii of the dominant spiral waves. This motion is, in
principle, large enough to be observable and could be confused with stellar
wobble due to the presence of one or more super-Jupiter mass protoplanets
orbiting at 10's AU. We discuss why the excursions in our simulation are so
much larger than those seen in simulations by Rice et al. 2003a.
