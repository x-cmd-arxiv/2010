  of the Gosset circles","19 pAGES, PLAIN TEX",,,,"math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A recent experimental discovery involving the spin structure of electrons in
a cold one-dimensional magnet points to a validation of a Zamolodchikov model
involving the exceptional Lie group $E_8$. The model predicts 8 particles and
predicts the ratio of their masses. I.e., the vertices of the 8-dimensional
Gosset polytope identifies with the 240 roots of $E_8$. Under the 2-D (Peter
McMullen) projection of the polytope, the image of the vertices are arranged in
8 concentric circles, here referred to as the Gosset circles. The Gosset
circles are understood to correspond to the 8 masses in the model, and it is
understood that the ratio of their radii is the same as the ratio of the
corres-ponding conjectural masses. A ratio of the two smallest circles (read 2
smallest masses) is the golden number. The conjectures have been now validated
experimentally, at least for the first five masses. The McMullen projection
generalizes to any complex simple Lie algebra whose rank is greater than 1. The
Gosset circles also generalize, using orbits of the Coxeter element. Using
results in a 1959 paper of mine, I found some time ago a very easily defined
operator $A$ whose spectrum is exactly the squares of the radii $r_i$ of these
generalized Gosset circles. As a confirmation, in the $E_8$ case, using only
the eigenvalues of a suitable multiple of $A$, Vogan computed the ratio of the
$r_i$. Happily these agree with the corresponding ratio of the Zamolodchikov
masses. The operator $A$ is written as a sum of $\ell +1$ rank 1 operators,
parameterized by the points in the extended Dynkin diagram. Involved in this
expansion are the coefficients $n_i$ of the highest root. Recalling the McKay
correspondence, in the $E_8$ case, the $n_i$, together with 1, are the
dimensions of the irreducible representations of the binary icosahedral group.

achievements of professional athletes from different historical eras.
Developing an objective approach will be of particular importance over the next
decade as Major League Baseball (MLB) players from the ""steroids era"" become
eligible for Hall of Fame induction. Here we address this issue, as well as the
general problem of comparing statistics from distinct eras, by detrending the
seasonal statistics of professional baseball players. We detrend player
statistics by normalizing achievements to seasonal averages, which accounts for
changes in relative player ability resulting from both exogenous and endogenous
factors, such as talent dilution from expansion, equipment and training
improvements, as well as performance enhancing drugs (PED). In this paper we
compare the probability density function (pdf) of detrended career statistics
to the pdf of raw career statistics for five statistical categories -- hits
(H), home runs (HR), runs batted in (RBI), wins (W) and strikeouts (K) -- over
the 90-year period 1920-2009. We find that the functional form of these pdfs
are stationary under detrending. This stationarity implies that the statistical
regularity observed in the right-skewed distributions for longevity and success
in professional baseball arises from both the wide range of intrinsic talent
among athletes and the underlying nature of competition. Using this simple
detrending technique, we examine the top 50 all-time careers for H, HR, RBI, W

calculate objective benchmarks based on extreme statistics which can be used

on estimation of Markov transition probabilities, non-parametric tests and

consolidated in the early 1990's with the publication of the monographs by
Fleming and Harrington (1991) and Andersen, Borgan, Gill and Keiding (1993).
The development was made possible by an unusually fast technology transfer of
pure mathematical concepts, primarily from French probability, into practical
biostatistical methodology, and we attempt to outline some of the personal
relationships that helped this happen. We also point out that survival analysis
was ready for this development since the martingale ideas inherent in the deep
understanding of temporal development so intrinsic to the French theory of
processes were already quite close to the surface in survival analysis.

anisotropy of the initial nuclear overlap geometry and arises from
event-by-event fluctuations in the participant-nucleon collision points. In
studies using a multi-phase transport model (AMPT), a triangular flow signal is
observed that is proportional to the participant triangularity and corresponds
to a large third Fourier coefficient in two-particle azimuthal correlation
functions. Using two-particle azimuthal correlations at large pseudorapidity
separations measured by the PHOBOS and STAR experiments, we show that this
Fourier component is also present in data. Ratios of the second and third
Fourier coefficients in data exhibit similar trends as a function of centrality
and transverse momentum as in AMPT calculations. These findings suggest a
significant contribution of triangular flow to the ridge and broad away-side
features observed in data. Triangular flow provides a new handle on the initial
collision geometry and collective expansion dynamics in heavy-ion collisions.

($M_B\ga-17$ mag) in the Local Volume (LV, $D\la10$ Mpc). The sample consists
mainly of early-type dwarf galaxies found in various environments in the LV.
Two galaxies (LEDA 166099 and UGCA 200) in the sample are detected in the
near-infrared for the first time. The deep near-infrared images allow for a
detailed study of the photometric and structural properties of each galaxy. The
surface brightness profiles of the galaxies are detected down to the ~$24 mag
arcsec^{-2}$ isophote in the $J$- and $H$-bands, and $23 mag arcsec^{-2}$ in
the $K_s$-band. The total magnitudes of the galaxies are derived in the three
wavelength bands. For the brightest galaxies ($M_B\la-15.5$ mag) in the sample,
we find that the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) underestimates the total
magnitudes of these systems by up to $\la0.5$ mag. The radial surface
brightness profiles of the galaxies are fitted with an exponential (for those
galaxies having a stellar disk) or S\'ersic law to derive the structure of the
underlying stellar component. In particular, the effective surface brightness
($\mu_e$) and effective radius ($r_e$) are determined from the analytic fits to
the surface brightness profile. The $J$-$K_s$ colours for the galaxies have
been measured to explore the luminosity-metallicity relation for early-type
dwarfs. In addition, the $B$-$K_s$ colours of the galaxies are used to assess
their evolutionary state relative to other galaxy morphologies. The total
stellar masses of the dwarf galaxies are derived from the $H$-band photometric
measurements. These will later be compared to the dynamical mass estimates for
the galaxies to determine their dark matter content.

simplifications usual for the MHD-approach in studying these instabilities are

the thermal flux perturbation generally stabilizes an instability. There is a
narrow region of the temperature gradient, where an instability is possible.
This result contradicts to a conclusion obtained in the MHD-approach. We show
that the reason of this contradiction is the simplified assumptions used in the
MHD analysis of buoyancy instabilities and the role of the longitudinal
electric field perturbation, which is not captured by the MHD equations. Our
dispersion relation also shows that a medium with the electron thermal flux can
be unstable, if the temperature gradient of ions and electrons have the

critical to several applications, such as identifying the onset of anomalous

biochemical spread by a sensor network. This is a challenging problem since
weak distributed patterns can be invisible in per node statistics as well as a
global network-wide aggregate. Most prior work considers situations in which
the activation/non-activation of each node is statistically independent, but
this is unrealistic in many problems. In this paper, we consider structured
patterns arising from statistical dependencies in the activation process. Our
contributions are three-fold. First, we propose a sparsifying transform that
succinctly represents structured activation patterns that conform to a
hierarchical dependency graph. Second, we establish that the proposed transform
facilitates detection of very weak activation patterns that cannot be detected
with existing methods. Third, we show that the structure of the hierarchical
dependency graph governing the activation process, and hence the network
transform, can be learnt from very few (logarithmic in network size)
independent snapshots of network activity.

speech recognition for more than 35 years in spite of the fact that a key HMM
assumption -- the statistical independence of frames -- is obviously violated
by speech data. In fact, this data/model mismatch has inspired many attempts to
modify or replace HMMs with alternative models that are better able to take
into account the statistical dependence of frames. However it is fair to say
that in 2010 the HMM is the consensus model of choice for speech recognition
and that HMMs are at the heart of both commercially available products and
contemporary research systems. In this paper we present a preliminary
exploration aimed at understanding how speech data depart from HMMs and what
effect this departure has on the accuracy of HMM-based speech recognition. Our
analysis uses standard diagnostic tools from the field of statistics --
hypothesis testing, simulation and resampling -- which are rarely used in the
field of speech recognition. Our main result, obtained by novel manipulations
of real and resampled data, demonstrates that real data have statistical
dependency and that this dependency is responsible for significant numbers of
recognition errors. We also demonstrate, using simulation and resampling, that
if we `remove' the statistical dependency from data, then the resulting
recognition error rates become negligible. Taken together, these results
suggest that a better understanding of the structure of the statistical
dependency in speech data is a crucial first step towards improving HMM-based
speech recognition.

sparse in some basis) using only a small number of random measurements.
Existing results in compressed sensing literature have focused on
characterizing the achievable performance by bounding the number of samples
required for a given level of signal sparsity. However, using these bounds to
minimize the number of samples requires a-priori knowledge of the sparsity of
the unknown signal, or the decay structure for near-sparse signals.
Furthermore, there are some popular recovery methods for which no such bounds
are known.
  In this paper, we investigate an alternative scenario where observations are
available in sequence. For any recovery method, this means that there is now a
sequence of candidate reconstructions. We propose a method to estimate the
reconstruction error directly from the samples themselves, for every candidate
in this sequence. This estimate is universal in the sense that it is based only
on the measurement ensemble, and not on the recovery method or any assumed
level of sparsity of the unknown signal. With these estimates, one can now stop
observations as soon as there is reasonable certainty of either exact or
sufficiently accurate reconstruction. They also provide a way to obtain
""run-time"" guarantees for recovery methods that otherwise lack a-priori
performance bounds.
  We investigate both continuous (e.g. Gaussian) and discrete (e.g. Bernoulli)
random measurement ensembles, both for exactly sparse and general near-sparse

ice-vapor system is monitored by the evolution of the two-point (density)
correlation function $C(\mathbf{r},t)$ and a particular thickness distribution
which is similar to a pore size distribution. We observe the absence of dynamic
scaling and reveal fundamentally different classes of length scales: The first
class comprises the mean ice thickness and the (inverse) specific surface area
(measured per ice volume) which increase monotonically and follow a power law.
The dynamic exponent is in accordance with coarsening of a locally conserved
order parameter. A second class of length scales is derived from the slopes of
$C(\mathbf{r},t)$ at the origin in different coordinate directions. All these
scales show a slower growth with anomalous power law scaling. The existence of
two different power laws is quantitatively consistent with coarsening of
fractal aggregates and reveal the persistence of power law correlations in the
initial condition where the snow contains dendritic structures. At low
temperatures these structures persist even over an entire year. A third class
of length scales can be defined by the first zero crossings of
$C(\mathbf{r},t)$. The zero crossings display a non-monotonic evolution with a
strong anisotropy between the direction of gravity and horizontal directions.
We attribute this behavior to larger scale structural relaxations of the ice
network which apparently leave the small scale interfacial relaxations
unaffected. However, vice versa it remains the question how structural mobility
is induced by interfacial coarsening.

three times larger than he number of moves required to solve an N disk puzzle.
The MToH comes in 3 flavors which differ in the rules for placing a disk on a
free post and therefore differ in the possible evolutions of the Tower states

the entire sky, leading to correlations which persist up to the highest CMB
multipoles, thus allowing a conclusive detection above cosmic variance.
Further, this anisotropic curvature causes different dimensions to expand at
different rates. This leads to other potentially observable signals including a
quadrupolar anisotropy in the CMB which limits the size of the curvature.
Conversely, if isotropic curvature is observed it may be evidence that our

  Diversity-Multiplexing Gain Tradeoff","submitted to IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Zheng and Tse have shown that over a quasi-static channel, there exists a
fundamental tradeoff, known as the diversity-multiplexing gain (D-MG) tradeoff.
In a realistic system, to avoid inefficiently operating the power amplifier,
one should consider the situation where constraints are imposed on the peak to
average power ratio (PAPR) of the transmitted signal. In this paper, the D-MG
tradeoff of multi-antenna systems with PAPR constraints is analyzed. For
Rayleigh fading channels, we show that the D-MG tradeoff remains unchanged with
any PAPR constraints larger than one. This result implies that, instead of
designing codes on a case-by-case basis, as done by most existing works, there
possibly exist general methodologies for designing space-time codes with low
PAPR that achieve the optimal D-MG tradeoff. As an example of such
methodologies, we propose a PAPR reduction method based on constellation
shaping that can be applied to existing optimal space-time codes without
affecting their optimality in the D-MG tradeoff. Unlike most PAPR reduction
methods, the proposed method does not introduce redundancy or require side
information being transmitted to the decoder. Two realizations of the proposed
method are considered. The first is similar to the method proposed by Kwok

nodes are Poisson distributed and where ALOHA is used as the MAC protocol. In
this paper we provide a general framework for the analysis of outage
probabilities in the high-reliability regime. The outage probability
characterization is based on two parameters: the intrinsic spatial contention
$\gamma$ of the network, introduced in [1], and the coordination level achieved
by the MAC as measured by the interference scaling exponent $\kappa$ introduced
in this paper. We study outage probabilities under the signal-to-interference
ratio (SIR) model, Rayleigh fading, and power-law path loss, and explain how
the two parameters depend on the network model. The main result is that the
outage probability approaches $\gamma\eta^{\kappa}$ as the density of
interferers $\eta$ goes to zero, and that $\kappa$ assumes values in the range
$1\leq \kappa\leq \alpha/2$ for all practical MAC protocols, where $\alpha$ is
the path loss exponent. This asymptotic expression is valid for all
motion-invariant point processes. We suggest a novel and complete taxonomy of
MAC protocols based mainly on the value of $\kappa$. Finally, our findings
suggest a conjecture that tightly bounds the outage probability for all

sensitive dependence to parameters; in particular, that the system exhibits an
asymmetric, large-amplitude response to normally distributed feedback forcing.
Such a response would imply irreducible uncertainty in climate change
predictions and thus have notable implications for climate science and
climate-related policy making. We show that equilibrium climate sensitivity in
all generality does not support such an intrinsic indeterminacy; the latter
appears only in essentially linear systems. The main flaw in the analysis that
led to this claim is inappropriate linearization of an intrinsically nonlinear
model; there is no room for physical interpretations or policy conclusions
based on this mathematical error. Sensitive dependence nonetheless does exist
in the climate system, as well as in climate models -- albeit in a very
different sense from the one claimed in the linear work under scrutiny -- and
we illustrate it using a classical energy balance model (EBM) with nonlinear
feedbacks. EBMs exhibit two saddle-node bifurcations, more recently called
""tipping points"", which give rise to three distinct steady-state climates, two
of which are stable. Such bistable behavior is, furthermore, supported by
results from more realistic, nonequilibrium climate models. In a truly
nonlinear setting, indeterminacy in the size of the response is observed only
in the vicinity of tipping points. We show, in fact, that small disturbances
cannot result in a large-amplitude response, unless the system is at or near
such a point. We discuss briefly how the distance to the bifurcation may be
related to the strength of Earth's ice-albedo feedback.

the system by a low order representation. In this letter we propose a general

shadowing, combined with dimensionality reduction techniques. Rather than
quantify the quality of a model based on the quality of predictions, which can
be irrelevant for chaotic systems since even excellent models can do poorly, we
suggest that a good model should allow shadowing by modeled data for long
times; this principle leads directly to an optimal shadowing criterion of model
reduction. This approach overcomes the usual difficulties encountered by
traditional methods which either compare systems of the same size by
normed-distance in the functional space, or measure how close an orbit
generated by a model is to the observed data. Examples include interval
arithmetic computations to validate the optimal shadowing.

energy release self-consistently. We find that the appearance of deconfinement
heating during spin-down result in not only the cooling delay but also the
increase of surface temperature of stars. For stars characterized by
intermediate and weak magnetic field strength, a period of increasing surface
temperature could exist. Especially, a sharp jump in surface temperature can be
produced as soon as quark matter appears in the core of stars with a weak

infrar ed astronomy. One of the main purposes of AKARI is the all-sky survey
performed with six infrared bands between 9 and 200um during the period from
2006 May 6 to
  2007 August 28. In this paper, we present the mid-infrared part (9um and 18um
b ands) of the survey carried out with one of the on-board instruments, the
Infrar ed Camera (IRC). Aims : We present unprecedented observational results
of the 9 and 18um AKARI al l-sky survey and detail the operation and data
processing leading to the point s ource detection and measurements. Methods :
The raw data are processed to produce small images for every scan and point
sources candidates, above the 5-sigma noise level per single scan, are der
ived. The celestial coordinates and fluxes of the events are determined
statisti cally and the reliability of their detections is secured through
multiple detect ions of the same source within milli-seconds, hours, and months
from each other. Results : The sky coverage is more than 90% for both bands. A
total of 877,091 s ources (851,189 for 9um, 195,893 for 18um) are confirmed and
included in the cur rent release of the point source catalogue. The detection
limit for point source s is 50mJy and 90mJy for the 9um and 18um bands,
respectively. The position accu racy is estimated to be better than 2"".
Uncertainties in the in-flight absolute flux calibration are estimated to be 3%
for the 9um band and 4% for the 18um ban d. The coordinates and fluxes of
detected sources in this survey are also compar ed with those of the IRAS
survey and found to be statistically consistent.

full-sky spatial distribution and clustering of pixels above/below threshold
from a large set of simulated maps with different levels of non-Gaussianity, we
find that a positive value of the dimensionless non-linearity parameter f_NL
enhances the number density of the cold CMB excursion sets along with their
clustering strength, and reduces that of the hot ones. We quantify the
robustness of this effect, which may be important to discriminate between the
simpler Gaussian hypothesis and non-Gaussian scenarios, arising either from
non-standard inflation or alternative early-universe models. The clustering of
hot and cold pixels exhibits distinct non-Gaussian signatures, particularly at
angular scales of about 75 arcmin (i.e. around the Doppler peak), which
increase linearly with f_NL. Moreover, the clustering changes strongly as a
function of the smoothing angle. We propose several statistical tests to
maximize the detection of a local primordial non-Gaussian signal, and provide
some theoretical insights within this framework, including an optimal selection
of the threshold level. We also describe a procedure which aims at minimizing
the cosmic variance effect, the main limit within this statistical framework.

reconstruction of the optical wavefront from measurements provided by a
wavefront sensor. As our application is adaptive optics on extremely large
telescopes, our algorithm was designed with speed and best quality in mind. The
latter is achieved thanks to a regularization which enforces prior statistics.
To solve the regularized problem, we use the conjugate gradient method which
takes advantage of the sparsity of the wavefront sensor model matrix and avoids
the storage and inversion of a huge matrix. The prior covariance matrix is
however non-sparse and we derive a fractal approximation to the Karhunen-Loeve
basis thanks to which the regularization by Kolmogorov statistics can be
computed in O(N) operations, N being the number of phase samples to estimate.
Finally, we propose an effective preconditioning which also scales as O(N) and
yields the solution in 5-10 conjugate gradient iterations for any N. The
resulting algorithm is therefore O(N). As an example, for a 128 x 128
Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor, FRiM appears to be more than 100 times faster
than the classical vector-matrix multiplication method.

high resolution archival images, reaching out to approximately the cluster's
half-mass radius (rhm), combined with deep WFPC2 images that extend our radial
coverage to more than 2 rhm. From our photometry, we derived a radial mass
segregation profile and a global mass function that we compared with those of
simulated clusters containing different energy sources (namely hard binaries
and/or an IMBH) able to halt core collapse and to quench mass segregation. A
set of direct N-body simulations of GCs, with and without an IMBH of mass 1% of
the total cluster mass, comprising different initial mass functions (IMFs) and
primordial binary fractions, was used to predict the observed mass segregation
profile and mass function. The mass segregation profile of M 10 is not
compatible with cluster models without either an IMBH or primordial binaries,
as a source of energy appears to be moderately quenching mass segregation in
the cluster. Unfortunately, the present observational uncertainty on the binary
fraction in M10 does not allow us to confirm the presence of an IMBH in the

both can equally well explain the radial dependence of the cluster mass

advantage of the lattice Boltzmann method: the easy treatment of boundary

identification of the thermal dominant state in a ULX based on the
disappearance of X-ray oscillations, low timing noise, and a spectrum dominated
by multicolor disk emission with luminosity varying to the 4th power of the
disk temperature. This indicates that ULXs are similar to Galactic BHBs. The
brightest X-ray spectrum can be fitted with a relativistic disk model with
either a highly super-Eddington (L_disk/L_Edd = 160) non-rotating black hole or
a close to Eddington (L_disk/L_Edd ~ 2) rapidly rotating black hole. The latter
interpretation is preferred, due to the absence of such highly super-Eddington
states in Galactic black holes and active galactic nuclei, and suggests that
the ULX in M82 contains a black hole of 200-800 solar masses with nearly
maximal spin. On long timescales, the source normally stays at a relatively low
flux level with a regular 62-day orbital modulation and occasionally exhibits
irregular flaring activity. The thermal dominant states are all found during

  Taylor & Francis Group LLC/CRC Press, 2011",,,,"astro-ph.HE astro-ph.CO astro-ph.GA hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this chapter I focus on asking and answering the following questions: (1)
What is a black hole? Answer: There are three types of black holes, namely
mathematical black holes, physical black holes and astrophysical black holes.
An astrophysical black hole, with mass distributed within its event horizon but
not concentrated at the singularity point, is not a mathematical black hole.
(2) Can astrophysical black holes be formed in the physical universe? Answer:
Yes, at least this can be done with gravitational collapse. (3) How can we
prove that what we call astrophysical black holes are really black holes?
Answer: Finding direct evidence of event horizon is not the way to go. Instead
I propose five criteria which meet the highest standard for recognizing new
discoveries in experimental physics and observational astronomy. (4) Do we have
sufficient evidence to claim the existence of astrophysical black holes in the
physical universe? Answer: Yes, astrophysical black holes have been found at
least in some galactic binary systems, at the center of almost every galaxy,
and as the central engines of at least some long gamma-ray bursts. (5) Will all
matter in the universe eventually fall into black holes? Answer: Probably ""no"",
because ""naked"" compact objects, if they do exist with radii smaller than the
radii of event horizons for their masses but are not enclosed by event
horizons, can rescue the universe from an eternal death by re-cycling out the
matter previously accreted into astrophysical black holes. Finally I also
discuss briefly if we need a quantum theory of gravity in order to further
understand astrophysical black holes, and what further astronomical
observations and telescopes are needed to make further progress on our
understanding of astrophysical black holes.

scattering amplitudes between incoming and outgoing partial waves, which can be
solved numerically. The main focus of the paper is the analytic determination
of the scattering amplitude in two limits, the small flux limit and the limit
of small vortex separation. In the latter limit the dominant contribution comes
from the S-wave amplitude. Calculating it, however, still requires solving an
infinite system of equations, which is achieved by the Riemann-Hilbert method.

The size-dependent energy spectra are calculated within the sp3d5s*

enhanced with respect to the experimental bulk value when the dopant is placed

approximately independent of the dopant position unless it is placed within a
surface shell of thickness of the order of the bulk Bohr radius, where the

with a strong Pauli paramagnetic depairing (PD) including CeCoIn_5. It is shown
here that such a tendency of field-induced AFM ordering is a consequence of
strong PD and should appear particularly in superconductors with a gap node
along the AFM modulation. Two phenomena seen in CeCoIn_5, the anomalous vortex
lattice form factor and the AFM order in the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov
state, are explained based on this peculiar PD effect.

it allows a very convenient framework to compute statistical quantities.
Physical origins of this spin model are made transparent by an exact mapping
into a one-dimensional Ising model with an external field. However, the
dependence on temperature of the reduced external field turns out to differ
from the standard one-dimensional Ising model and hence it gives rise to
different thermophysical properties, despite the exact mapping connecting them.

derived from the FLAPW basis and is exact for wave-function products. The
singularity of the bare and screened interaction potentials gives rise to a
numerically important self-energy contribution, which we treat analytically to
achieve good convergence with respect to the k-point sampling. As numerical
realizations of the GW approximation typically suffer from the high

very efficient by exploiting spatial and time-reversal symmetry as well as by
applying an optimization of the mixed product basis that retains only the
numerically important contributions of the electron-electron interaction.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that one can employ an extrapolar approximation for

self-energy. We show convergence tests, CPU timings, and results for prototype
semiconductors and insulators as well as ferromagnetic nickel.

are fully taken into account in the spectral analysis. The energy spectra in
the 2-120 keV band in both states are all dominated by strong Comptonization of
disk photons by an optically thick (\tau ~7-10) and low temperature (T_e ~2-3
keV) hybrid plasmas containing non-thermal electrons produced with 10-60% of
the total power input. Absorption lines of highly ionized Fe ions detected
during the oscillation indicate that a strong disk wind is developed. The
ionization stage of the wind correlates with the X-ray flux, supporting the
photoionization origin. The iron-K emission line shows a strong variability
during the oscillation; the reflection is strongest during the dip but
disappears during the flare. We interpret this as evidence for ""self-shielding""
that the Comptonizing corona becomes geometrically thick in the flare phase,
preventing photons from irradiating the outer disk. The low-temperature and
high luminosity disk emission suggests that the disk structure is similar to
that in the very high state of canonical black hole binaries. The spectral
variability during the oscillation is explained by the change of the disk
geometry and of the physical parameters of Comptonizing corona, particularly
the fractional power supplied to the acceleration of non-thermal particles.

nanocrystals (NCs) with 2 nm in diameter which can be experimentally
synthesized with Mn atoms inside. Using the density-functional theory, we
consider two doping cases: NCs containing one or two Mn impurities. Although
the Mn d peaks carry five up electrons in the dot, the local magnetic moment on
the Mn site is 4.65 mu_B. It is smaller than 5 mu_B because of the sp-d
hybridization between the localized 3d electrons of the Mn atoms and the s- and
p-type valence states of the host compound. The sp-d hybridization induces
small magnetic moments on the Mnnearest- neighbor Te sites, antiparallel to the
Mn moment affecting the p-type valence states of the undoped dot, as usual for
a kinetic-mediated exchange magnetic coupling. Furthermore, we calculate the
parameters standing for the sp-d exchange interactions. Conduction N0\alpha and
valence N0\beta are close to the experimental bulk values when the Mn
impurities occupy bulklike NCs' central positions, and they tend to zero close
to the surface. This behavior is further explained by an analysis of
valence-band-edge states showing that symmetry breaking splits the states and
in consequence reduces the exchange. For two Mn atoms in several positions, the
valence edge states show a further departure from an interpretation based in a
perturbative treatment. We also calculate the d-d exchange interactions |Jdd|
between Mn spins. The largest |Jdd| value is also for Mn atoms on bulklike
central sites; in comparison with the experimental d-d exchange constant in
bulk Cd0.95Mn0.05Te, it is four times smaller.

to understand the regularizations' performance as SFS models. The strong
suppression of spectrally local SFS interactions and the conservation of
small-scale circulation in the Lagrangian-averaged Navier-Stokes alpha-model
(LANS-alpha) is found to lead to the formation of rigid bodies. These
contaminate the superfilter-scale energy spectrum with a scaling that
approaches k^1 as the SFS spectra is resolved. The Clark-alpha and Leray-alpha
models, truncations of LANS-alpha, do not conserve small-scale circulation and
do not develop rigid bodies. LANS-alpha, however, is closest to Navier-Stokes
in intermittency properties. All three models are found to be stable at high
Reynolds number. Differences between L^2 and H^1 norm models are clarified. For
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), the presence of the Lorentz force as a source (or
sink) for circulation and as a facilitator of both spectrally nonlocal large to
small scale interactions as well as local SFS interactions prevents the
formation of rigid bodies in Lagrangian-averaged MHD (LAMHD-alpha). We find
LAMHD-alpha performs well as a predictor of superfilter-scale energy spectra

prove to be a generally applicable MHD-LES.

field inside the clusters is a result of turbulent amplification within them,
with the magnetic seed originating from star-burst driven, galactic outflows.
We evaluate three models, where we choose different normalizations for the
Cosmic Ray proton population within clusters. Similar to our previous analysis
of the Coma cluster (Donnert et al. 2010), the radial profile and the
morphological properties of observed radio halos can not be reproduced, even
with a radially increasing energy fraction within the cosmic ray proton
population. Scaling relations between X-ray luminosity and radio power can be
reproduced by all models, however all models fail in the prediction of clusters
with no radio emission. Also the evolutionary tracks of our largest clusters in
all models fail to reproduce the observed bi-modality in radio luminosity. This
provides additional evidence that the framework of hadronic, secondary models
is disfavored to reproduce the large scale diffuse radio emission of galaxy
clusters. We also provide predictions for the unavoidable emission of
$\gamma$-rays from the hadronic models for the full cluster set. None of such
secondary models is yet excluded by the observed limits in $\gamma$-ray
emission, emphasizing that large scale diffuse radio emission is a powerful
tool to constrain the amount of cosmic ray protons in galaxy clusters.

studies, however, have not considered the effect of the host star. There is a
large body of observational evidence that eclipse times of binary stars can
vary dramatically due to variations in the quadrupole moment of the stars
driven by stellar activity. In this paper we investigate and estimate the
likely impact such variations have on the transit times of exoplanets. We find
in several cases that such variations should be detectable. In particular, the
estimated period changes for WASP-18b are of the same order as those expected
for tidal dissipation, even for relatively low values of the tidal dissipation
parameter. The transit time variations caused by the Applegate mechanism are
also of the correct magnitude and occur on timescales such that they may be
confused with variations caused by light-time travel effects due to the
presence of a Jupiter-like second planet. Finally, we suggest that transiting
exoplanet systems may provide a clean route (compared to binaries) to
constraining the type of dynamo operating in the host star.

clear signatures of kinematic perturbations, probably due to interactions among
compact group galaxies. A comparison between the B-band Tully-Fisher relation
for compact group galaxies and that for the GHASP field-galaxy sample shows
that, despite the high fraction of compact group galaxies with asymmetric
rotation curves, these lie on the Tully-Fisher relation defined by galaxies in
less dense environments, although with more scatter. This is in agreement with
previous results, but now confirmed for a larger sample of 41 galaxies. We
confirm the tendency for compact group galaxies at the low-mass end of the
Tully-Fisher relation (HCG 49b, 89d, 96c, 96d and 100c) to have either a
magnitude that is too bright for its mass (suggesting brightening by star
formation) and/or a low maximum rotational velocity for its luminosity
(suggesting tidal stripping). These galaxies are outside the Tully Fisher
relation, at the 1 sigma level, even when the minimum acceptable values of
inclinations are used to compute their maximum velocities. The inclusion of
such galaxies with v<100 km/s in the determination of the zero point and slope
of the compact group B-band Tully-Fisher relation would strongly change the
fit, making it different from the relation for field galaxies, a fact that has
to be kept in mind when studying scaling relations of interacting galaxies,
specially at high redshifts.

the assumptions that the initial data $u_0$ is a bounded and measurable
function and $\sigma$ is nonconstant and Lipschitz continuous. In this case, we
find conditions under which the preceding stochastic PDE admits a unique

stars due to the absence of significant line-of-sight confusion. Methods: The
youngest detached shells, those around the carbon stars R Scl and U Cam, are
studied here in great detail in scattered stellar light with the Advanced
Survey Camera on the Hubble Space Telescope. Quantitative results are derived
assuming optically thin dust scattering. Results: The detached dust shells
around R Scl and U Cam are found to be consistent with an overall spherical
symmetry. They have radii of 19.2"" (corresponding to a linear size of 8x10^16
cm) and 7.7"" (5x10^16 cm), widths of 1.2"" (5x10^15 cm) and 0.6"" (4x10^15 cm),
and dust masses of 3x10^-6 and 3x10^-7 M(Sun), respectively. The dynamical ages
of the R Scl and U Cam shells are estimated to be 1700 and 700 yr,
respectively, and the shell widths correspond to time scales of 100 and 50 yr,
respectively. Small-scale structure in the form of less than arcsec-sized
clumps is clearly seen in the images of the R Scl shell. Average clump dust
masses are estimated to be about 2x10^-9 M(Sun). Comparisons with CO line
interferometer data show that the dust and gas shells coincide spatially,
within the errors (<=1"" for U Cam and approx. 2"" for R Scl). Conclusions: The
results are consistent with the interpretation of geometrically thin gas and
dust shells formed by a mass-loss eruption during a He-shell flash, and where
interaction with a previous wind plays a role as well. Clumpy structure is
present in the R Scl shell, possibly as a consequence of the mass loss itself,
but more likely as a consequence of instabilities in the expanding shell.

of column indices of $H$ such that the restriction of $H$ to $S$ does not
contain a row of weight one. The stopping set distribution $\{T_i(H)\}_{i=0}^n$
enumerates the number of stopping sets with size $i$ of $C$ with parity-check

to the parity-check matrix $H$ of $C$. Let $H^{*}$ be the parity-check matrix
of $C$ which is formed by all the non-zero codewords of its dual code
$C^{\perp}$. A parity-check matrix $H$ is called BEC-optimal if
$T_i(H)=T_i(H^*), i=0,1,..., n$ and $H$ has the smallest number of rows. On the
BEC, iterative decoder of $C$ with BEC-optimal parity-check matrix is an
optimal decoder with much lower decoding complexity than the exhaustive

BEC-optimal parity-check matrices of binary linear codes. Using finite geometry
in combinatorics, we obtain BEC-optimal parity-check matrices and then
determine the stopping set distributions for the Simplex codes, the Hamming

temperatures, near the transition into the paramagnet, modest transverse fields
increase the pinning, stabilize the domain structure, and harden the magnet,
until a point where the field induces quantum tunneling of the domain walls and
softens the magnet. At low temperatures, tunneling completely dominates the
domain dynamics and provides an interpretation of the quantum phase transition
in highly disordered magnets as a localization/delocalization transition for
domain walls. While the energy scales of the rare earth ferromagnet studied
here restrict the effects to cryogenic temperatures, the principles discovered

incorporates analytic expressions for the dipolar potential of an arbitrary
polynomial density profile, thereby reducing the problem of handling non-local
dipolar interactions to the solution of algebraic equations.
  We comprehensively map out the static solutions and excitation modes,
including non-cylindrically symmetric traps, and also the case of negative
scattering length where dipolar interactions stabilize an otherwise unstable
condensate. The dynamical stability of the excitation modes gives insight into
the onset of collapse of a dipolar BEC. We find that global collapse is
consistently mediated by an anisotropic quadrupolar collective mode, although
there are two trapping regimes in which the BEC is stable against quadrupole
fluctuations even as the ratio of the dipolar to s-wave interactions becomes
infinite. Motivated by the possibility of fragmented BEC in a dipolar Bose gas
due to the partially attractive interactions, we pay special attention to the
scissors modes, which can provide a signature of superfluidity, and identify a
long-range restoring force which is peculiar to dipolar systems. As part of the

  Controllable, driven phase transitions","4 pages, 3 figures",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Here we report from our theoretical studies that in biased bilayer graphene,
one can induce phase transitions from an incompressible state to a compressible
state by tuning the bandgap at a given electron density. Likewise, variation of
the density with a fixed bandgap results in a transition from the FQHE states
at lower Landau levels to compressible states at intermediate Landau levels and
finally to FQHE states at higher Landau levels. This intriguing scenario of
tunable phase transitions in the fractional quantum Hall states is unique to
bilayer graphene and never before existed in conventional semiconductor
systems.

Computation Tree Logic (CTL). SMV model checker is used for the purpose of

that are nonconcave as functions of the energy in the thermodynamic limit are
discussed and compared. The five methods are based on the following ideas and
techniques: i) microcanonical contraction, ii) metastable branches of the free
energy, iii) generalized canonical ensembles with specific illustrations
involving the so-called Gaussian and Betrag ensembles, iv) restricted canonical
ensemble, and v) inverse Laplace transform. A simple long-range spin model
having a nonconcave entropy is used to illustrate each method.

the surface of optimally-doped superconducting Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2 single crystal
by using a four-probe scanning tunneling microscopy. While some non-uniform
contrast appears near the edge of the cleaved crystal, the scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) reveals mostly uniform contrast. For the regions that showed
uniform SEM contrast, a sharp superconducting transition at TC = 22.1 K has
been observed with a transition width (delta)Tc = 0.2 K. In the non-uniform
contrast region, TC is found to vary between 19.6 and 22.2 K with (delta)Tc
from 0.3 to 3.2 K. The wavelength dispersive x-ray spectroscopy reveals that Co
concentration remains 7.72% in the uniform region, but changes between 7.38%
and 7.62% in the non-uniform region. Thus the variations of superconductivity
are associated with local compositional change.
