along the line of sight we construct maps of the polarized Galactic synchrotron

23 GHz band of the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe and the 353 GHz
Archeops data.}{The best-fit parameters obtained are consistent with previous
estimates in the literature based only on synchrotron emission and pulsar
rotation measurements. They allows us to reproduce the large scale structures
observed on the data. Poorly understood local Galactic structures and
turbulence make difficult an accurate reconstruction of the observations in the
Galactic plane. Finally, using the best-fit model we are able to estimate the
expected polarized foreground contamination at the Planck frequency bands. For
the CMB bands, 70, 100, 143 and 217 GHz, at high Galactic latitudes although
the CMB signal dominates in general, a significant foreground contribution is
expected at large angular scales. In particular, this contribution will
dominate the CMB signal for the B modes expected from realistic models of a
background of primordial gravitational waves.

electron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS) of O_2 molecules on Ag(110). Semilocal
DFT calculations predict a spinless adsorbed molecule, however the inclusion of
the U leads to the polarization of the molecule by shifting a spin-polarized
molecular orbital towards the Fermi level. A molecular resonance at the Fermi
level can imply a decrease in conductance while in the off-resonance case, an
increase in conductance is the expected IETS signal. We use the lowest-order
expansion on the electron-vibration coupling, in order to evaluate the
magnitude and spatial distribution of the inelastic signal. This allows us to
reproduce the experimental data in: (i) the negative conductance variation
observed in the vibrational spectra of O_2 along the [001] direction, (ii) the
spatial distribution of the conductance changes recorded over the O_2 molecule
for the O--O stretch and the antisymmetric O_2--Ag stretch vibrations, (iii)
the absence of signal for the center-of-mass and hindered rotations modes, and
(iv) the lack of IETS signal for the molecule chemisorbed along the [1-10]
direction. Moreover, our results give us insight of the electronic and
vibrational symmetries at play. The vibrational frequencies need to go beyond
the harmonic approximation in order to be compared with the experimental ones,
hence we present a Morse-potential fitting of the potential energy surface in
order to evaluate accurate vibrational frequencies. The final IET spectra are
evaluated with the help of the self-consistent Born Approximation and the

electromagnetic or massless scalar field at zero temperature, thermal effects
exist. The rotating reference system is constructed as an infinite set of
Frenet-Seret tetrads so that the detector is at rest in a tetrad at each proper
time. Frequency spectrum of correlation functions contains the Planck thermal
factor with temperature $T_{rot} = \frac{\hbar \Omega}{2 \pi k_B} $. The energy
density the rotating detector observes is proportional to the sum of energy
densities of Planck's spectrum at the temperature $T_{rot}$ and zero-point
radiation. The proportionality factor is $2/3 (4 \gamma^2 -1)$ for an EMF and
$2/9 (4 \gamma^2 -1)$ for a MSF, where $\gamma = (1 - (\frac{\Omega
r}{c})^2)^{-1/2}$, and r is a rotation radius. The origin of these thermal
effects is the periodicity of the correlation functions and their discrete
spectrum, both following rotation with angular velocity $\Omega$. The thermal
energy can also be interpreted as a source of a vacuum force (VF) applied to
the rotating detector from the vacuum field. The VF depends on the size of
neither the charge nor the mass, like the force in the Casimir model for a
charged particle, but, contrary to the last one, VF is attractive and directed
to the center of the circular orbit. VF infinitely grows in magnitude with
orbit radius. The orbits with a radius greater than $c/ \Omega$ do not exist
because the returning VF becomes infinite. On the uttermost orbit with the
radius $c / \Omega$, a linear velocity of the rotating particle would have
become c. The VF becomes very small and proportional to radius when r is very
small. Such VF dependence on radius, at large and small radii, can be
associated respectively with so called confinement and asymptotic freedom,
known in quantum chromodynamics, and provide a new explanation for them.

polarized differential source counts down to 400 microJy. These counts indicate
that sources have a higher degree of fractional polarization at fainter Stokes

fractional polarization and spectral index. We also matched deep field sources
to counterparts in the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty Centimeters

distinguish between relevant causally connected earthquakes. Our correlation
metric is a variation on the one introduced by Baiesi and Paczuski (2004). A
network of earthquakes is constructed, which is time ordered and with links
between the more correlated ones. Data pertaining to the California region has
been used in the study. Recurrences to earthquakes are identified employing
correlation thresholds to demarcate the most meaningful ones in each cluster.
The distribution of recurrence lengths and recurrence times are analyzed
subsequently to extract information about the complex dynamics. We find that
the unimodal feature of recurrence lengths helps to associate typical rupture
lengths with different magnitude earthquakes. The out-degree of the network
shows a hub structure rooted on the large magnitude earthquakes. In-degree
distribution is seen to be dependent on the density of events in the
neighborhood. Power laws are also obtained with recurrence time distribution
agreeing with the Omori law.

requires a large scale magnetic field at near equipartition strength. However
the minimum magnetization has never been tested. We investigate the time
evolution of an accretion disk threaded by a weak vertical magnetic field. The
strength of the field is such that the disk magnetization falls off rapidly
with radius. Four 2.5D numerical simulations of viscous resistive accretion
disk are performed using the magnetohydrodynamic code PLUTO. In these
simulations, a mean field approach is used and turbulence is assumed to give
rise to anomalous transport coefficients (alpha prescription). The large scale
magnetic field introduces only a small perturbation to the disk structure, with
accretion driven by the dominant viscous torque. A super fast magnetosonic jet
is observed to be launched from the innermost regions and remains stationary
over more than 953 Keplerian orbits. The self-confined jet is launched from a
finite radial zone in the disk which remains constant over time. Ejection is
made possible because the magnetization reaches unity at the disk surface, due
to the steep density decrease. However, no ejection is reported when the
midplane magnetization becomes too small. The asymptotic jet velocity remains
nevertheless too low to explain observed jets due to the negligible power
carried away by the jet. Astrophysical disks with superheated surface layers
could drive analogous outflows even if their midplane magnetization is low.
Sufficient angular momentum would be extracted by the turbulent viscosity to
allow the accretion process to continue. The magnetized outflows would be no
more than byproducts, rather than a fundamental driver of accretion. However,
if the midplane magnetization increases towards the center, a natural
transition to an inner jet dominated disk could be achieved.

desirable to develop similar guidelines for the sampling of other trace gases
in exhaled breath, especially volatile organic compounds (VOCs) which reflect
ongoing metabolism. The concentrations of water-soluble, blood-borne substances
in exhaled breath are influenced by: (i) breathing patterns affecting gas
exchange in the conducting airways; (ii) the concentrations in the
tracheo-bronchial lining fluid; (iii) the alveolar and systemic concentrations
of the compound. The classical Farhi equation takes only the alveolar
concentrations into account. Real-time measurements of acetone in end-tidal
breath under an ergometer challenge show characteristics which cannot be
explained within the Farhi setting. Here we develop a compartment model that
reliably captures these profiles and is capable of relating breath to the
systemic concentrations of acetone. By comparison with experimental data it is
inferred that the major part of variability in breath acetone concentrations
(e.g., in response to moderate exercise or altered breathing patterns) can be
attributed to airway gas exchange, with minimal changes of the underlying blood
and tissue concentrations. Moreover, it is deduced that measured end-tidal
breath concentrations of acetone determined during resting conditions and free
breathing will be rather poor indicators for endogenous levels. Particularly,
the current formulation includes the classical Farhi and the Scheid series
inhomogeneity model as special limiting cases.

ways to describe apparent structures in the gauge and flavour sectors of the
Standard Model. Both symmetries put constraints on the high energy behaviour of
the theory. This can give rise to unexpected interplay when building models
that possess both symmetries. We investigate on the possibility to combine a
Pati-Salam model with the discrete flavour symmetry $S_4$ that gives rise to
quark-lepton complementarity. Under appropriate assumptions at the GUT scale,
the model reproduces fermion masses and mixings both in the quark and in the
lepton sectors. We show that in particular the Higgs sector and the running
Yukawa couplings are strongly affected by the combined constraints of the Grand
Unified and family symmetries. This in turn reduces the phenomenologically
viable parameter space, with high energy mass scales confined to a small region
and some parameters in the neutrino sector slightly unnatural. In the allowed
regions, we can reproduce the quark masses and the CKM matrix. In the lepton
sector, we reproduce the charged lepton masses, including bottom-tau
unification and the Georgi-Jarlskog relation as well as the two known angles of
the PMNS matrix. The neutrino mass spectrum can present a normal or an inverse
hierarchy, and only allowing the neutrino parameters to spread into a range of
values between $\lambda^{-2}$ and $\lambda^2$, with $\lambda\simeq0.2$.
Finally, our model suggests that the reactor mixing angle is close to its

light curve shows a >3 mag FUV brightening over the course of ~5 hours, with an
estimated peak brightness of ~16.7 mag, followed by a decrease to ~20 mag.

variables, we suggest that TDK2 is likely to be an SX Phoenicis star with ~55

used. Direct Infrared Flux Method (IRFM) has been used on the basis of 2MASS
infrared photometry. H_alpha wings have been fitted against synthetic grids
computed by means of 1D LTE atmosphere models, assuming different
self-broadening theories. Finally, a grid of H_alpha profiles has been computed
by means of 3D hydrodynamical atmosphere models. The Li I doublet at 670.8 nm
has been used to measure A(Li) by means of 3D hydrodynamical NLTE spectral
syntheses. An analytical fit of A(Li)(3D, NLTE) as a function of equivalent
width, T_eff, log g, and [Fe/H] has been derived and is made available. A(Li)
does not exhibit a plateau below [Fe/H]=-3. A strong positive correlation with
[Fe/H] appears, not influenced by the choice of the T_eff estimator. From a
linear fit, we obtain a strong slope of about 0.30 dex in A(Li) per dex in
[Fe/H], significant to 2-3 sigma, and consistent among all the four T_eff
estimators. A significant slope is also detected in the A(Li)--T_eff plane,
driven mainly by the coolest stars in the sample which appear Li-poor. Removing
such stars does not alter the behavior in the A(Li)-[Fe/H] plane. The scatter
in A(Li) increases by a factor of 2 towards lower metallicities, while the
plateau appears very thin above [Fe/H]=-2.8. The meltdown of the Spite plateau
below [Fe/H]\sim-3 is established, but its cause is unclear. If the primordial
A(Li) is the one derived from WMAP, it appears difficult to envision a single
depletion phenomenon producing a thin, metallicity independent plateau above
[Fe/H]=-2.8, and a highly scattered, metallicity dependent distribution below.
The fact that no star below [Fe/H]=-3 lies above the plateau suggests that they
formed at plateau level and underwent subsequent depletion.

only the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), which lies at the peak of the X-ray

the observed UV star formation rate of ~140 Msun/yr. Most star formation occurs
in the core of the BCG and in a 42 kpc long filament of blue continuum, line
emission, and X-ray emission, that extends southwest of the galaxy. The
surrounding filamentary nebula is the most luminous around any observed BCG.
The number of ionizing stars in the BCG is barely sufficient to ionize and heat
the nebula, and the line ratios indicate an additional heat source is needed.
This heat source can contribute to the H\alpha-deduced star formation rates
(SFRs) in BCGs and therefore the derived SFRs should only be considered upper
limits. AGN feedback can slow down the cooling flow to the observed mass
deposition rate if the black hole accretion rate is of the order of 0.5 Msun/yr

spectroscopy to test the reliability of the PAH fraction as determined from SED
fits alone. The PAH fraction in the SMC is low compared to the Milky Way and
variable--with relatively high fractions (q_PAH~1-2%) in molecular clouds and
low fractions in the diffuse ISM (<q_PAH>=0.6%). We use the map of PAH fraction
across the SMC to test a number of ideas regarding the production, destruction
and processing of PAHs in the ISM. We find weak or no correlation between the
PAH fraction and the distribution of carbon AGB stars, the location of
supergiant H I shells and young SN remnants, or the turbulent Mach number. We
find that the PAH fraction is correlated with CO intensity, peaks in the dust
surface density and the molecular gas surface density as determined from 160 um
emission. The PAH fraction is high in regions of active star-formation, as
predicted by its correlation with molecular gas, but is suppressed in H II
regions. Because the PAH fraction in the diffuse ISM is generally very low--in
accordance with previous work on modeling the SED of the SMC--and the PAH
fraction is relatively high in molecular regions, we suggest that PAHs are

from the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid to gapped phases with either Neel or dimer
order. Interestingly, these two types of ordered phases appear alternately as
the easy-plane anisotropy is changed towards the isotropic limit. The
appearance of the antiferromagnetic (Neel) order in this model is remarkable,
as it is strongly unfavored by both the easy-plane ferromagnetic NN coupling

emergent trimer degrees of freedom play a crucial role in the formation of the

the best-ever solar irradiance measurements from several different satellite
instruments, this minimum offers a unique opportunity to advance our
understanding of secular (long-term) changes in the solar irradiance.
Comparisons of the 2007-2009 irradiance results to the irradiance levels during
the previous minimum in 1996 suggest that the solar irradiance is lower in this
current minimum. For example, the total solar irradiance (TSI) indicates lower
irradiance in 2008 than in 1996 by about 200 ppm, and the SOHO Solar EUV

However, these irradiance variations have 30-50% uncertainties due to these
results depending strongly on instrument degradation trends over 12 years.
Supporting evidence for lower irradiance include that the solar magnetic fields
are lower and that there are more low-latitude coronal holes during this

similar high-velocity absorption (up to -2100 km/s) in the UV resonance lines
of Si IV 1394, 1403 across the 2003.5 event. UV lines from low-ionization
species, such as Si II 1527, 1533 and C II 1334, 1335, show absorption up to
-1200 km/s, indicating that the absorption with v from -1200 to -2100 km/s
originates in a region markedly faster and more ionized than the nominal wind
of the primary star. Observations obtained at the OPD/LNA during the last 4
spectroscopic cycles (1989-2009) also display high-velocity absorption in He I
10833 during periastron. Based on the OPD/LNA dataset, we determine that

of the spectroscopic cycle, but absent in spectra taken at phi < 0.947 and phi
> 1.049. Therefore, we constrain the duration of the high-velocity absorption
to be 95 to 206 days (or 0.047 to 0.102 in phase). We suggest that the
high-velocity absorption originates from shocked gas in the wind-wind collision
zone, at distances of 15 to 45 AU in the line-of-sight to the primary star.
Using 3-D hydrodynamical simulations of the wind-wind collision zone, we find
that the dense high-velocity gas is in the line-of-sight to the primary star
only if the binary system is oriented in the sky so that the companion is
behind the primary star during periastron, corresponding to a longitude of
periastron of omega ~ 240 to 270 degrees. We study a possible tilt of the
orbital plane relative to the Homunculus equatorial plane and conclude that our
data are broadly consistent with orbital inclinations in the range i=40 to 60

science and engineering including plasma physics, petroleum engineering, and
image processing. Standard numerical methods can produce spurious oscillations
when they are used to solve those problems. A common approach to avoid this
difficulty is to design a proper numerical scheme and/or a proper mesh so that
the numerical solution validates the discrete counterpart (DMP) of the maximum
principle satisfied by the continuous solution. A well known mesh condition for
the DMP satisfaction by the linear finite element solution of isotropic
diffusion problems is the non-obtuse angle condition that requires the dihedral
angles of mesh elements to be non-obtuse. In this paper, a generalization of
the condition, the so-called anisotropic non-obtuse angle condition, is
developed for the finite element solution of heterogeneous anisotropic
diffusion problems. The new condition is essentially the same as the existing
one except that the dihedral angles are now measured in a metric depending on
the diffusion matrix of the underlying problem. Several variants of the new
condition are obtained. Based on one of them, two metric tensors for use in
anisotropic mesh generation are developed to account for DMP satisfaction and
the combination of DMP satisfaction and mesh adaptivity. Numerical examples are
given to demonstrate the features of the linear finite element method for
anisotropic meshes generated with the metric tensors.

only one, gauge-invariant variable which describes the perturbation to the
energy density and which becomes equal to the usual Newtonian energy density in
the non-relativistic limit. The same holds true for the perturbation to the
particle number density. Using these two new variables, a new manifestly
gauge-invariant cosmological perturbation theory has been developed. Density
perturbations evolve diabatically. Perturbations in the total energy density
are gravitationally coupled to perturbations in the particle number density,
irrespective of the nature of the particles. There is, in first-order, no
back-reaction of perturbations to the global expansion of the universe.
Small-scale perturbations in the radiation-dominated era oscillate with an
increasing amplitude, whereas in older, less precise treatments, oscillating
perturbations are found with a decreasing amplitude. This is a completely new
and, obviously, important result, since it makes it possible to explain and

the number expected given the different mean ages of the two populations. The

observed gas and stars in the outer disk (little or no dark matter in the disk
is required). The vertical velocity dispersion of the outer disk H_alpha knots
nearly matches that measured from older planetary nebulae near the outskirts of
the optical disk by Herrmann et al., suggesting a low level of scattering in

the inner regions of galaxy clusters. It can be used to constrain the density
profiles and to measure the mass of the lenses. Moreover, the abundance of
strong lensing events can be used to constrain the structure formation and the
cosmological parameters through the so-called ""arc-statistics"" approach.
However, several issues related to the usage of strong lensing clusters in
cosmological applications are still controversial, leading to the suspect that
several biases may affect this very peculiar class of objects. With this study
we aim at better understanding the properties of galaxy clusters which can
potentially act as strong lenses. We do so by investigating the properties of a
large sample of galaxy clusters extracted from the N-body/hydrodynamical
simulation MareNostrum Universe. We explore the correlation between the cross
section for lensing and many properties of clusters, like the mass, the
three-dimensional and projected shapes, their concentrations, the X-ray
luminosity and the dynamical activity. We find that the probability of strong
alignments between the major axes of the lenses and the line of sight is a
growing function of the lensing cross section. In projection, the strong lenses
appear rounder within R200, but we find that their cores tend to be more
elliptical as the lensing cross section increases. We also find that the
cluster concentrations estimated from the projected density profiles tend to be
biased high. The X-ray luminosity of strong lensing clusters is higher than
that of normal lenses of similar mass and redshift. This is particular
significant for the least massive lenses. Finally, we find that the strongest
lenses generally exhibit an excess of kinetic energy within the virial radius,
indicating that they are more dynamically active than usual clusters.

newly developed particle-in-cell Monte Carlo method. Compared to moment
closures, the PDF methodology provides the full one-point one-time PDF of the
underlying fields containing all higher moments and correlations. The
small-scale mixing of the scalar released from a concentrated source at the
street level is modelled by the interaction by exchange with the conditional
mean (IECM) model, with a micro-mixing time scale designed for geometrically
complex settings. The boundary layer along no-slip walls (building sides and
tops) is fully resolved using an elliptic relaxation technique, which captures
the high anisotropy and inhomogeneity of the Reynolds stress tensor in these
regions. A less computationally intensive technique based on wall functions to
represent boundary layers and its effect on the solution are also explored. The
calculated statistics are compared to experimental data and large-eddy
simulation. The present work can be considered as the first example of
computation of the full joint PDF of velocity and a transported passive scalar

statistical information on the turbulence and pollutant concentration fields in

released at the IAU General Assembly on 2009 August 10. It is a highly
accurate, all-sky astrometric catalog of about 100 million stars in the R = 8
to 16 magnitude range. Recent epoch observations are based on over 270,000 CCD
exposures, which have been re-processed for the UCAC3 release applying
traditional and new techniques. Challenges in the data have been high dark
current and asymmetric image profiles due to the poor charge transfer
efficiency of the detector. Non-Gaussian image profile functions were explored
and correlations are found for profile fit parameters with properties of the
CCD frames. These were utilized to constrain the image profile fit models and
adequately describe the observed point-spread function of stellar images with a
minimum number of free parameters. Using an appropriate model function, blended
images of double stars could be fit successfully. UCAC3 positions are derived
from 2-dimensional image profile fits with a 5-parameter, symmetric Lorentz
profile model. Internal precisions of about 5 mas per coordinate and single
exposure are found, which are degraded by the atmosphere to about 10 mas.
However, systematic errors exceeding 100 mas are present in the x,y-data which
have been corrected in the astrometric reductions following the x,y-data
reduction step described here.

accretion disk instability on the evolution of white dwarf (WD) binaries, we
performed detailed binary evolution calculations for the WD + red-giant (RG)
channel of SNe Ia, in which a carbon-oxygen WD accretes material from a RG star
to increase its mass to the Chandrasekhar mass limit. According to these
calculations, we mapped out the initial and final parameters for SNe Ia in the
orbital period--secondary mass plane for various WD masses for this channel. We
discussed the influence of the variation of the duty cycle value on the regions
for producing SNe Ia. Similar to previous studies, this work also indicates
that the long-period dwarf novae offer a possible ways for producing SNe Ia.
Meanwhile, we find that the surviving companion stars from this channel have a
low mass after SN explosion, which may provide a means for the formation of the
population of single low-mass WDs (<0.45Msun).

well reproduced by the model calculations with reasonable parameters for ADAFs
with magnetically driven outflows. Our model calculations is always consistent
with the slope of the correlation independent of the values of the parameters
adopted. Compared with the observations, our results show that over 60% of the
accreted gas at the outer radius escapes from the accretion disc in a wind
before the gas falls into the black holes. The observed correlation between

peak at $W\sim 1.685$ GeV. This result, being considered in conjunction with
the recent evidence for a narrow structure at $W\sim 1.68$GeV in the $\eta$
photoproduction on the neutron, suggests the existence of a new nucleon
resonance with unusual properties: the mass $M\sim 1.685$GeV, the narrow width
$\Gamma \leq 30$MeV, and the much stronger photoexcitation on the neutron than
on the proton.

as low as the TeV scale. If this is the way of nature, quantum gravity effects
could be visible at the LHC or other High energy colliders. A model independent
signal is given by elastic scattering at small angles and transplanckian
energy, which can be computed in the eikonal approximation. It is interesting
both from a phenomenological and a theoretical point of view to study the
corrections to this process due to the QCD radiation. To include it, we
generalize a shock-wave method proposed by 't Hooft, so that we are able to
obtain the amplitude at first order in the gauge interaction but resummed to
all orders in gravity. From this result we can learn many interesting things,
for example we can extract the true scale of the process which agrees with an
earlier guess of Emparan, Masip and Rattazzi. The problem of radiation in
transplanckian scattering is briefly introduced, we then report and comment the
recent results and mention the perspectives for the near future.

has in a suitable one- and two-electron subspace. Such an operator description
is that consistent with the model exact global symmetry recently extended to
$SO(3)\times SO(3)\times U(1)$. There is a large consensus that in the
thermodynamic limit $N_a^2\rightarrow\infty$ long-range antiferromagnetic order
occurs in the spin-density $m=0$ ground state of the half-filled Hubbard model
on the square lattice. Here we find that the corresponding spontaneous symmetry
breaking lowers the symmetry of such a state from $SO(3)\times SO(3)\times

[SO(3)\times U(1)\times U(1)]/Z_2$ for $N_a^2\rightarrow\infty$. Moreover, we
argue that the spin effective lattice being identical to the original lattice

antiferromagnetic order in the limit $N_a^2\rightarrow\infty$. Consistently,
strong evidence is provided that for very small hole concentration $0<x\ll1$

detection criteria were used to distinguish point sources (star candidates) and
extended objects (star cluster candidates). Using a synthetic CMD method, we
estimated the star formation history. Using simple stellar population model
fitting, we calculated the mass and age of the cluster candidates. The field
star formation rate appears to have been roughly constant, or to have possibly
increased by up to about a factor of two, for ages younger than $\sim$300 Myr
within the fields covered by our data. Our data do not allow us to constrain
the star formation histories at older ages. We identify a small number of
clusters in both fields. Neither massive ($>10^5$ M$_\odot$) clusters nor
clusters with ages $\geq1$ Gyr were found in the galaxy and we found few
clusters older than 100 Myr. Based on our direct comparison of field stars and
clusters in NGC 4395, we estimate the ratio of star formation rate in clusters
that survive for $10^7$ to $10^8$ years to the total star formation to be
$\Gamma\sim0.03$. We suggest that this relatively low $\Gamma$ value is caused

(PADs) in the molecular frame. Here carbonylsulfide (OCS) and benzonitrile
molecules, fixed in space by combined laser and electrostatic fields, are
ionized with intense, circularly polarized, 30 femtosecond laser pulses. For
1-dimensionally oriented OCS the molecular frame PADs exhibit pronounced
anisotropies, perpendicular to the fixed permanent dipole moment, that are
absent in PADs from randomly oriented molecules. For 3-dimensionally oriented
benzonitrile additional striking structures appear due to suppression of
electron emission in nodal planes of the fixed electronic orbitals. Our
theoretical analysis, relying on tunneling ionization theory, shows that the
PADs reflect nodal planes, permanent dipole moments and polarizabilities of
both the neutral molecule and its cation. The calculated results are
exponentially sensitive to changes in these molecular properties thereby
pointing to exciting opportunities for time-resolved probing of valence
electrons dynamics by intense circularly polarized pulses. Molecular frame PADs
from oriented molecules will prove important in other contexts notably in
emerging free-electron-laser studies where localized inner shell electrons are

in the reference frame rotating with the vortices, provided the particle
response time and the vortex strength ratio lie in appropriate ranges. A

stable, and can therefore trap particles released in their basin of attraction.
A complete trapping diagram is derived, showing that any vortex pair can
potentially become a dust trap, provided the vortex strength ratio is different
from 0 (single vortex) and -1 (translating symmetrical vortices). Trapping
exists for both co-rotating or contra-rotating vortex pairs. In the latter

extrapolations, we investigate a model for the global coronal magnetic field
which is non-potential and time-dependent, following the build-up and transport
of magnetic helicity due to flux emergence and large-scale photospheric
motions. This helicity concentrates into twisted magnetic flux ropes, which may
lose equilibrium and be ejected. Here, we consider how the magnetic structure
predicted by this model-in particular the flux ropes-varies over the solar
activity cycle, based on photospheric input data from six periods of cycle 23.
The number of flux ropes doubles from minimum to maximum, following the total
length of photospheric polarity inversion lines. However, the number of flux
rope ejections increases by a factor of eight, following the emergence rate of
active regions. This is broadly consistent with the observed cycle modulation
of coronal mass ejections, although the actual rate of ejections in the
simulation is about a fifth of the rate of observed events. The model predicts

Electrical Engineering and Mathematics major in a Basic Circuits course. In his
own words, he's a ""fringe"" student because of his robust tendency to try making
sense of the concepts being taught rather than memorizing formulae. He also
feels alienated because he views learning in terms of argument and intuition,
not algorithm and rote acceptance. Furthermore, for Michael the practice of
sense-making defines him; it's an integral aspect of his identity [4]. Thus,
Michael's self-reported sense of alienation resonates strongly with existing
identity-based accounts of students leaving the field [5],[6]. We contend the

Through this case study of Michael, we urge the retention discussion to
consider not just the demographic categories of people we hope to keep, but

computation and to describe various physical processes. This paper revisits the
relationship between relativistic quantum mechanics and the quantum walks. We
show the similarities of the mathematical structure of the decoupled and
coupled form of the discrete-time quantum walk to that of the Klein-Gordon and
Dirac equations, respectively. In the latter case, the coin emerges as an
analog of the spinor degree of freedom. Discrete-time quantum walk as a coupled
form of the continuous-time quantum walk is also shown by transforming the
decoupled form of the discrete-time quantum walk to the Schrodinger form. By
showing the coin to be a means to make the walk reversible, and that the
Dirac-like structure is a consequence of the coin use, our work suggests that
the relativistic causal structure is a consequence of conservation of
information. However, decoherence (modelled by projective measurements on
position space) generates entropy that increases with time, making the walk
irreversible and thereby producing an arrow of time. Lieb-Robinson bound is
used to highlight the causal structure of the quantum walk to put in
perspective the relativistic structure of quantum walk, maximum speed of the
walk propagation and the earlier findings related to the finite spread of the
walk probability distribution. We also present a two-dimensional quantum walk
model on a two state system to which the study can be extended.

distinguish between relevant causally connected earthquakes. Our correlation
metric is a variation on the one introduced by Baiesi and Paczuski (2004). A
network of earthquakes is constructed, which is time ordered and with links
between the more correlated ones. Recurrences to earthquakes are identified
employing correlation thresholds to demarcate the most meaningful ones in each
cluster. Data pertaining to three different seismic regions, viz. California,
Japan and Himalayas, are comparatively analyzed using such a network model. The
distribution of recurrence lengths and recurrence times are two of the key
features analyzed to draw conclusions about the universal aspects of such a
network model. We find that the unimodal feature of recurrence length
distribution, which helps to associate typical rupture lengths with different
magnitude earthquakes, is robust across the different seismic regions. The
out-degree of the networks shows a hub structure rooted on the large magnitude
earthquakes. In-degree distribution is seen to be dependent on the density of
events in the neighborhood. Power laws, with two regimes having different
exponents, are obtained with recurrence time distribution. This is in agreement
with the Omori law for aftershocks and extends it to spatial recurrences. The
crossover to the second power law regime can be taken to be signalling the end
of aftershock regime in an objective fashion.

presented for 33 stars on the red giant branch of the globular cluster omega
Centauri. They are based on intermediate-resolution spectroscopic data covering
the blue spectral region analyzed using spectrum synthesis techniques. The data
reveal the existence of a broad range in the abundances of these elements, and
a comparison with similar data for main sequence stars enables insight into the
evolutionary history of the cluster. The majority of the red giant branch stars
were found to be depleted in carbon, i.e. [C/Fe]<0, while [N/Fe] for the same
stars shows a range of ~1 dex, from [N/Fe]~0.7 to 1.7 dex. The
strontium-to-iron abundance ratios varied from solar to mildly enhanced
(0.0<=[Sr/Fe]<=0.8), with [Ba/Fe] generally equal to or greater than [Sr/Fe].
The carbon and nitrogen abundance ratios for the one known CH star in the
sample, ROA 279, are [C/Fe]=0.6 and [N/Fe]=0.5 dex. Evidence for evolutionary
mixing on the red giant branch is found from the fact that the relative carbon
abundances on the main sequence are generally higher than those on the red
giant branch. However, comparison of the red giant branch and main sequence
samples shows that the upper level of nitrogen enhancement is similar in both
sets at [N/Fe]~2.0dex. This is most likely the result of primordial rather than
evolutionary mixing processes. One red giant branch star, ROA 276, was found to
have Sr and Ba abundance ratios. High resolution spectra of ROA 276 were
obtained with the Magellan Telescope/MIKE spectrograph combination to confirm
this result, revealing that ROA 276 is indeed an unusual star. For this star
calculations of the depletion effect strongly suggest that the observed Sr
enhancement in ROA 276 is of primordial origin, rather than originating from a
surface accretion event.

admissible range of lengths in nature: from, say, atoms to clusters of galaxies
i.e. from micro to macrocosms. According to current cosmological theories,
galaxies are embedded within massive non-baryonic dark matter (DM) halos, which
affects their formation and evolution. It is therefore highly rewarding to
understand the role of tidal interaction between the dark and luminous matter
in galaxies. The current investigation is devoted to Early-Type Galaxies
(ETGs), looking in particular at the possibility of establishing whether the
tidal interaction of the DM halo with the luminous baryonic component may be at
the origin of the so-called ""tilt"" of the Fundamental Plane (FP). The extension
of the tensor virial theorem to two-component matter distributions implies the
calculation of the self potential energy due to a selected subsystem, and the
tidal potential energy induced by the other one. The additional assumption of
homeoidally striated density profiles allows analytical expressions of the
results for some cases of astrophysical interest. The current investigation
raises from the fact that the profile of the (self + tidal) potential energy of
the inner component shows maxima and minima, suggesting the possible existence
of preferential scales for the virialized structure, i.e. a viable explanation
of the so called ""tilt"" of the FP. It is found that configurations related to
the maxima do not suffice, by themselves, to interpret the FP tilt, and some
other relation has to be looked for.

interpret this as evidence that the population dynamics in the ocean is
approximately scale-invariant. We use this invariance in the construction and
solution of a size-structured dynamical population model. Starting from a
Markov model encoding the basic processes of predation, reproduction,
maintenance respiration and intrinsic mortality, we derive a partial
integro-differential equation describing the dependence of abundance on weight
and time. Our model represents an extension of the jump-growth model and hence
also of earlier models based on the McKendrick--von Foerster equation. The
model is scale-invariant provided the rate functions of the stochastic
processes have certain scaling properties. We determine the steady-state power
law solution, whose exponent is determined by the relative scaling between the
rates of the density-dependent processes (predation) and the rates of the
density-independent processes (reproduction, maintenance, mortality). We study
the stability of the steady-state against small perturbations and find that
inclusion of maintenance respiration and reproduction in the model has astrong
stabilising effect. Furthermore, the steady state is unstable against a change
in the overall population density unless the reproduction rate exceeds a
certain threshold.

simple chordal planar curves converges uniformly whenever certain Loewner
driving functions converge. We extend this result to random curves. The random
version applies in particular to random lattice paths that have chordal
$\mathrm {SLE}_{\kappa}$ as a scaling limit, with $\kappa <8$
(nonspace-filling). Existing $\mathrm {SLE}_{\kappa}$ convergence proofs often
begin by showing that the Loewner driving functions of these paths (viewed from
$\infty$) converge to Brownian motion. Unfortunately, this is not sufficient,
and additional arguments are required to complete the proofs. We show that
driving function convergence is sufficient if it can be established for both
parametrization directions and a generic observation point.

Ar-like ions that sheds new light on the behavior of the rate coefficient at
low-temperatures where these ions form in photoionized plasmas. We provide
results for the total and partial Maxwellian-averaged DR rate coefficients from
the initial ground level of K II -- Zn XIII ions. It is expected that these new
results will advance the accuracy of the ionization balance for Ar-like M-shell
ions and pave the way towards a detailed modeling of astrophysically relevant
X-ray absorption features. We utilize the AUTOSTRUCTURE computer code to obtain
the accurate core-excitation thresholds in target ions and carry out
multiconfiguration Breit-Pauli (MCBP) calculations of the DR cross section in
the independent-processes, isolated-resonance, distorted-wave (IPIRDW)
approximation. Our results mediate the complete absence of direct DR
calculations for certain Ar-like ions and question the reliability of the
existing empirical rate formulas, often inferred from renormalized data within
this isoelectronic sequence.
