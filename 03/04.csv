we discuss collider constraints on MSSM neutralino dark matter with mass in the
5-15 GeV range. Such an LSP would be a Bino with a small Higgsino admixture.
Maximization of the DM-nucleon scattering cross section for such a WIMP
requires a light Higgs boson with tan beta enhanced couplings. Limits on the
invisible width of the Z boson, when combined with Tevatron constraints on
Higgs bosons at large tan beta, and the rare decay $B^{\pm} \to \tau \nu$
constrain cross sections to be below $\sigma_n \lesssim 2 \times 10^{-41}
{cm}^2$. This indicates a slight local Dark Matter over-density would be
necessary to explain the CoGeNT excess. This scenario also requires a light
charged Higgs boson, which can give substantial contributions to rare decays
such as $b \to s \gamma$ and $t \to b H^+$.

transfer simulations for three bands in the source spectrum (Lyman, UV, and

temperature fluctuation of the 21 cm signal has an amplitude greater than 100
mK during the early reionization, up to 10 times greater than the typical

importantly, we find that even a rather high contribution from QSO-like sources
only damps the absorption regime without erasing it. Heating the IGM with X-ray
takes time. Our results show that observations of the early reionization will
probably benefit from a higher signal-to-noise value than during later stages.

counts and large-scale power spectrum of clusters. We consider a survey with
high-sensitivity and wide-area to detect about 2.5 x 10^5 extended sources.
Based on the self-calibration approach, and including Planck priors in our
analysis, we constrain 9 cosmological parameters and 4 nuisance parameters,
which define the relation between cluster mass and X-ray flux. Because of the
scale dependence of large-scale bias induced by local-shape non-Gaussianity, we
find that the power spectrum provides strong constraints on the non-Gaussianity
f_nl parameter, which complement the stringent constraints on the power
spectrum normalization, \sigma_8, from the number counts. To quantify the joint
constraints on theese two parameters, that specify the timing of structure
formation for a fixed background expansion, we define the figure-of-merit
FoM_SFT = (det[Cov(sigma_8,f_nl)])^{-1/2}. We find that our surveys constrain
deviations from Gaussianity with a precision of \Delta f_nl~10 at 1 \sigma
confidence level, with FoM_SFT~39. We point out that constraints on f_nl are
weakly sensitive to the uncertainties in the knowledge of nuisance parameters.
As an application of non-Gaussian constraints from available data, we analyse
the impact of positive skewness on the occurrence of XMMU-J2235, a massive
distant cluster discovered at z~1.4. We confirm that in a WMAP-7 Gaussian
Lambda CDM cosmology, within the survey volume, ~5x10^{-3} objects like this
are expected to be found: to increase this probability by a factor of at least
10, one needs to evade either the available constraints on f_nl or sigma_8.

superior charge mobility and thermal transport for potential device
applications. Morphological corrugation can strongly influence the transport
properties of the supported graphene. In this paper, we theoretically analyze
the morphological stability of a graphene monolayer on an oxide substrate,
subject to van der Waals interactions and in-plane mismatch strains. First, we
define the equilibrium separation and the interfacial adhesion energy as the
two key parameters that characterize the van der Waals interaction between a
flat monolayer and a flat substrate surface. By a perturbation analysis, a
critical compressive mismatch strain is predicted, beyond which the graphene
monolayer undergoes strain-induced instability, forming corrugations with
increasing amplitude and decreasing wavelength on a perfectly flat surface.
When the substrate surface is not perfectly flat, the morphology of graphene
depends on both the amplitude and the wavelength of the surface corrugation. A
transition from conformal (corrugated) to non-conformal (flat) morphology is
predicted. The effects of substrate surface corrugation on the equilibrium mean
thickness of the supported graphene and the interfacial adhesion energy are
analyzed. Furthermore, by considering both the substrate surface corrugation
and the mismatch strain, it is found that, while a tensile mismatch strain
reduces the corrugation amplitude of graphene, a corrugated substrate surface
promotes strain-induced instability under a compressive strain. These
theoretical results suggest possible means to control the morphology of
graphene monolayer on oxide substrates by surface patterning and strain
engineering.

an effective diagnostic method to disentangle the active galactic nucleus (AGN)
and starburst (SB) contribution to this class of objects. The intrinsic
bolometric corrections are estimated for both the components, in order to
obtain the relative AGN/SB contribution to the total luminosity of each source.
Our main results are the following: 1) The AGN detection rate among local
ULIRGs amounts up to 70 per cent, with 113/164 convincing detections within our
sample, while the global AGN/SB power balance is ~1/3. 2) A general agreement
is found with optical classification; however, among the objects with no
spectral signatures of nuclear activity, our IR diagnostics find a subclass of
elusive, highly obscured AGN. 3) We analyse the correlation between nuclear
activity and IR luminosity, recovering the well-known trend of growing AGN
significance as a function of the overall energy output of the system: the
average AGN contribution rises from ~10 to ~60 per cent across the ULIRG
luminosity range. 4) We confirm that the AGN content is larger in compact
systems, but the link between activity and evolutionary stage is rather loose.
5) By analysing a control sample of IR-luminous galaxies around z ~ 1, we find
evidence for only minor changes with redshift of the large-scale spectral
properties of the AGN and SB components. This underlines the potential of our
method as a straightforward and quantitative AGN/SB diagnostic tool for
ULIRG-like systems at high redshift as well.

  Context: Very few examples of luminous blue variable (LBV) stars or LBV
candidates (LBVc) are known, particularly at metallicities below the SMC. The
LBV phase is crucial for the evolution of massive stars, and its behavior with
metallicity is poorly known. V39 in IC 1613 is a well-known photometric
variable, with B-band changes larger than 1mag. over its period. The star,
previously proposed to be a projection of a Galactic W Virginis and an IC 1613
red supergiant, shows features that render it a possible LBVc.
  Method: We investigate mid-resolution blue and red VLT-VIMOS spectra of V39,
covering a time span of 40 days, and perform a quantitative analysis of the
combined spectrum using the model atmosphere code CMFGEN.
  Results: We identify strong Balmer and FeII P-Cygni profiles, and a hybrid
spectrum resembling a B-A supergiant in the blue and a G-star in the red. No
significant Vrad variations are detected, and the spectral changes are small
over the photometric period. Our analysis places V39 in the low-luminosity part
of the LBV and LBVc region, but it is also consistent with a sgB[e] star.
  Conclusions: The radial velocity indicates that V39 belongs to IC 1613. The
lack of Vrad changes and spectroscopic variations excludes binary scenarios.
The features observed are not consistent with a W Virginis star, and this
possibility is also discarded. We propose that the star is a B-A LBVc or sgB[e]
star surrounded by a thick disk precessing around it.
  If confirmed, V39 would be the lowest metallicity resolved LBV candidate
known to date. Alternatively, it could represent a new transient phase of
massive star evolution, an LBV impostor.

in terms of a four-vector with nonzero component only in the time-direction,
rendered it an ideal target for experimentalists and a natural concept-testing

complexity, still with vectorial symmetry violation but adopting a generic
four-vector. We also offer a preliminary characterization of the phenomenology
of this more general framework, sufficient to expose a rather significant
increase in complexity with respect to the original Myers-Pospelov setup. Most

the case when the majority of neutron spins are oriented opposite to the

The source positions are shifted up to $\sim 0.5""$ radially towards the disk
centre and 5 arcsecond source sizes can be two times larger even for an
isotropic source (minimum albedo effect) at 1 Mm above the photosphere. X-ray
sources therefore should have minimum observed sizes, thus FWHM source size
(2.35 times second-moment) will be as large as $\sim 7""$ in the 20-50 keV range
for a disk-centered point source at a height of 1 Mm ($\sim 1.4""$) above the

primary X-ray spectra, stronger downward anisotropy, for sources closer to the
solar disk centre, and between the energies of 30 and 50 keV. Albedo should be
taken into account when X-ray footpoint positions, footpoint motions or source

confidence limits on this parameter. These sixteen lines include seven that
have not previously been reported on in the literature. The extended wavelength
range of these lines allows us to infer, for the first time, a clear increase
in tau_* with line wavelength, as expected from the wavelength increase of
bound-free absorption opacity. The small overall values of tau_*, reflected in
the rather modest asymmetry in the line profiles, can moreover all be fit
simultaneously by simply assuming a moderate mass-loss rate of 3.5 \pm 0.3
\times 10^{-6} Msun/yr, without any need to invoke porosity effects in the
wind. The quoted uncertainty is statistical, but the largest source of
uncertainty in the derived mass-loss rate is due to the uncertainty in the
elemental abundances of zeta Pup, which affects the continuum opacity of the
wind, and which we estimate to be a factor of two. Even so, the mass-loss rate
we find is significantly below the most recent smooth-wind H-alpha mass-loss
rate determinations for zeta Pup, but is in line with newer determinations that
account for small-scale wind clumping. If zeta Pup is representative of other
massive stars, these results will have important implications for stellar and

Examples include fermions coupled to a fluctuating transverse gauge field

to determining the low energy physics. Our approach relies on combining an
expansion in the inverse number (N) of fermion species with a further expansion

the universal low energy physics of these problems. The method is illustrated
by studying spinon fermi surface spin liquids, and a quantum critical metal at
a second order electronic nematic phase transition. We calculate the low energy
single particle spectra, and various interesting two particle correlation

redshift-space overdensity field over a finite radial distance does not remove
all the anisotropic distortions. We investigate this effect, showing that it
strongly boosts the amplitude of clustering for narrow samples and can also
reduce the significance of baryonic features in the correlation function. We
argue that the effect can be mitigated by binning in apparent galaxy
pair-centre rather than galaxy position, and applying an upper limit to the
radial galaxy separation. We demonstrate this approach, contrasting against
standard top-hat binning in galaxy distance, using sub-samples taken from the
Hubble Volume simulations. Using a simple model for the radial distribution
expected for galaxies from a survey such as the Dark Energy Survey (DES), we
show that this binning scheme will simplify analyses that will measure baryon
acoustic oscillations within such galaxy samples. Comparing results from
different binning schemes has the potential to provide measurements of the

significant detection of dust out to a clustercentric distance of 30 Mpc/h in
all four independent SDSS colours, consistent with the expectations of weak
lensing masses of similar mass halos and excess galaxy counts. The wavelength
dependence of this colour excess is consistent with the expectations of a Milky
Way dust law with R_V=3.1. Further, we find that the halo mass dependence of
the dust content is much smaller than would be expected by a simple scaling,
implying that the dust-to-gas ratio of the most massive clusters (~10E14
Msun/h) is ~3% of the local ISM value, while in small groups (~10E12.7 Msun/h)
it is ~55% of the local ISM value. We also find that the dust must have a
covering fraction on the order of 10% to explain the observed color
differences, which means the dust is not just confined to the most massive
galaxies. Comparing the dust profile with the excess galaxy profile, we find
that the implied dust-to-galaxy ratio falls significantly towards the group or
cluster center. This has a significant halo mass dependence, such that the more

examine the potential of the colliders to distinguish models with parity
stabilized DM from models in which the DM is stabilized by other symmetries. We
often take the latter to be a Z_3 symmetry for illustration. We focus on
signatures where a single particle, charged under the DM stabilization symmetry
decays into the DM and Standard Model (SM) particles. Such a Z_3-charged
""mother"" particle can decay into one or two DM particles along with the same SM
particles. This can be contrasted with the decay of a Z_2-charged mother
particle, where only one DM particle appears. Thus, if the intermediate
particles in these decay chains are off-shell, then the reconstructed invariant
mass of the SM particles exhibits two kinematic edges for the Z_3 case but only
one for the Z_2 case. For the case of on-shell intermediate particles,
distinguishing the two symmetries requires more than the kinematic edges. In
this case, we note that certain decay chain ""topologies"" of the mother particle
which are present for the Z_3 case (but absent for the Z_2 case) generate a
""cusp"" in the invariant mass distribution of the SM particles. We demonstrate
that this cusp is generally invariant of the various spin configurations. We

methods view the compound effects of multiple genes on a phenotype as a sum of
partial influences of each individual gene and can often miss a substantial
part of the heritable effect. Such methods do not use any biological knowledge
about underlying genotype-phenotype mechanisms. Modeling approaches from the AI
field that incorporate deterministic knowledge into models to perform
statistical analysis can be applied to include prior knowledge in genetic
analysis. We chose to use the most general such approach, Markov Logic Networks
(MLNs), as a framework for combining deterministic knowledge with statistical
analysis. Using simple, logistic regression-type MLNs we have been able to
replicate the results of traditional statistical methods. Moreover, we show
that even with simple models we are able to go beyond finding independent
markers linked to a phenotype by using joint inference that avoids an
independence assumption. The method is applied to genetic data on yeast
sporulation, a phenotype governed by non-linear gene interactions. In addition
to detecting all of the previously identified loci associated with sporulation,
our method is able to identify four loci with small effects. Since their effect
on sporulation is small, these four loci were not detected with methods that do
not account for dependence between markers due to gene interactions. We show
how gene interactions can be detected using more complex models, which can be

(Q1) when does one dominate the other, that is, does L_1(X) PsD imply L_2(X)
PsD? (Q2) when do they have the same solution set? Such questions can be
NP-hard. This paper describes a natural relaxation of an LMI, based on
substituting matrices for the variables x_j. With this relaxation, the
domination questions (Q1) and (Q2) have elegant answers, indeed reduce to
constructible semidefinite programs. Assume there is an X such that L_1(X) and
L_2(X) are both PD, and suppose the positivity domain of L_1 is bounded. For
our ""matrix variable"" relaxation a positive answer to (Q1) is equivalent to the
existence of matrices V_j such that L_2(x)=V_1^* L_1(x) V_1 + ... + V_k^*
L_1(x) V_k. As for (Q2) we show that, up to redundancy, L_1 and L_2 are
unitarily equivalent.
  Such algebraic certificates are typically called Positivstellensaetze and the
above are examples of such for linear polynomials. The paper goes on to derive
a cleaner and more powerful Putinar-type Positivstellensatz for polynomials
positive on a bounded set of the form {X | L(X) PsD}.
  An observation at the core of the paper is that the relaxed LMI domination
problem is equivalent to a classical problem. Namely, the problem of
determining if a linear map from a subspace of matrices to a matrix algebra is
""completely positive"".

silicate absorption features are moderately deep and emission features are
shallow. We compare the mid-IR luminosities to AGN luminosity tracers and found
that the mid-IR radiation is emitted quite isotropically. In two cases, IC5063
and MCG-3-34-64, we find evidence for extended dust emission in the narrow-line
region. We confirm the correlation between observed silicate feature strength
and Hydrogen column density recently found in Spitzer data. In a further step,
our 3D clumpy torus model has been used to interpret the data. We show that the
strength of the silicate feature and the mid-IR spectral index can be used to
get reasonable constraints on the dust distribution in the torus. The mid-IR
spectral index, alpha, is almost exclusively determined by the radial dust
distribution power-law index, a, and the silicate feature depth is mostly
depending on the average number of clouds, N0, along an equatorial
line-of-sight and the torus inclination. A comparison of model predictions to
our type 1 and type 2 AGN reveals typical average parameters a=-1.0+/-0.5 and
N0=5-8, which means that the radial dust distribution is rather shallow. As a
proof-of-concept of this method, we compared the model parameters derived from
alpha and the silicate feature to more detailed studies of IR SEDs and
interferometry and found that the constraints on a and N0 are consistent.
Finally, we might have found evidence that the radial structure of the torus
changes from low to high AGN luminosities towards steeper dust distributions,
and we discuss implications for the IR size-luminosity relation. (abridged)

density and temperature fall, the planet orbital migration and disk depletion
timescales eventually become comparable, with the precise timing depending on
the mass of the planet. When this occurs, the planet decouples from the
equilibrium radius. At this time, however, the gas surface density is already
too low to drive substantial further migration. A higher mass planet, of 10
Earth masses, can open a gap during the late evolution of the disk, and stops
migrating. Low mass planets, with 1 or 0.1 Earth masses, released beyond 1 AU

periodic funnel geometries where a drive is applied in the easy flow direction.
We show that this system exhibits a number of different commensurability
effects when the vortex configurations match to both the periodicity of the
array and the geometry of the funnels. The vortex configurations in this system
are generally different from those observed for single isolated triangular
superconducting samples due to the coupling of vortices in adjacent funnels. At
certain matching fields, peaks in the critical current are absent due to the
particular vortex configurations that occur at these fields. We find that the
overall depinning force increases with increasing vortex density as a result of
the enhanced vortex-vortex interactions caused by a crowding effect at the
funnel tips. When a system becomes less mobile as a result of increased
particle interactions, it is said to exhibit a jamming behavior. Under an
applied drive we observe a series of elastic and plastic vortex flow phases
which produce pronounced features such as jumps or dips in the transport
curves. In all of the flow phases, only one vortex can pass through the funnel
tip at a time due to the vortex-vortex repulsion forces. As a consequence of
this constraint, we observe the remarkable result that the sum of the vortex
velocities at a fixed drive remains nearly constant with increasing magnetic
field B rather than increasing linearly. This result is similar to the behavior
of sand in an hourglass. We also show how noise fluctuations can be used to
distinguish the different flow phases. Our results should be readily
generalizable to other systems of particles flowing in periodic funnel
geometries, such as colloids or Wigner crystals.

to standard SPH which explicitly uses Newtons third law of motion continuously
applying equal but opposite forces between particles. rpSPH does not show the
unphysical particle noise, the clumping or banding instability, unphysical
surface tension, and unphysical scattering of different mass particles found
for standard SPH. At the same time it uses fewer computational operations. and
only changes a single line in existing SPH codes. We demonstrate its
performance on isobaric uniform density distributions, uniform density shearing
flows, the Kelvin-Helmholtz and Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities, the Sod shock

Barbara galaxy cluster formation test. rpSPH is an improvement these cases. The
improvements come at the cost of giving up exact momentum conservation of the

(1-3)R_{200} of the main cluster (where R_{200} is similar to the virial

firms, which cover nearly all companies in the mid- and large-scale ranges in
terms of firm size, to reach several key findings on profits/sales distribution
and business growth trends. First, detailed balance is observed not only in
profits data but also in sales data. Furthermore, the growth-rate distribution
of sales has wider tails than the linear growth-rate distribution of profits in
log-log scale. On the one hand, in the mid-scale range of profits, the
probability of positive growth decreases and the probability of negative growth
increases symmetrically as the initial value increases. This is called
Non-Gibrat's First Property. On the other hand, in the mid-scale range of
sales, the probability of positive growth decreases as the initial value
increases, while the probability of negative growth hardly changes. This is
called Non-Gibrat's Second Property. Under detailed balance, Non-Gibrat's First
and Second Properties are analytically derived from the linear and quadratic
growth-rate distributions in log-log scale, respectively. In both cases, the
log-normal distribution is inferred from Non-Gibrat's Properties and detailed
balance. These analytic results are verified by empirical data. Consequently,
this clarifies the notion that the difference in shapes between growth-rate
distributions of sales and profits is closely related to the difference between
the two Non-Gibrat's Properties in the mid-scale range.

contain an irreducible source of explicit PQ violation which is proportional to
the determinant of the Yukawa interaction matrix of colored fermions.
Generically, this contribution is of low operator dimension and will
drastically destabilize the axion potential, so its suppression is a necessary
condition for solving the strong CP problem. We propose a mechanism whereby the
PQ symmetry is kept exact up to n=12 with the help of the very same flavor
symmetries which generate the hierarchical quark masses and mixings of the SM.
This ""axion flavor protection"" is straightforwardly realized in theories which
employ radiative fermion mass generation and grand unification. A universal

improved by including an anisotropic stress term in the Euler equation. The

long wavelengths and weakly damped oscillatory time dependent behavior is seen
for a large range of spatial modes. When the size of the internal potential is

outbursts (~10 yr) and short orbital periods (<~ 85 min). A significant part of
WZ Sge stars may remain undiscovered because of low outburst activity.
Recently, the observed orbital period distribution of cataclysmic variables
(CVs) has changed partly because outbursts of new WZ Sge stars have been
discovered routinely. Hence, the estimation of the intrinsic population of WZ
Sge stars is important for the study of the population and evolution of CVs. In
this paper, we present a Bayesian approach to estimate the intrinsic period
distribution of dwarf novae from observed samples. In this Bayesian model, we
assumed a simple relationship between the recurrence time and the orbital
period which is consistent with observations of WZ Sge stars and other dwarf
novae. As a result, the minimum orbital period was estimated to be ~70 min. The
population of WZ Sge stars exhibited a spike-like feature at the shortest
period regime in the orbital period distribution. These features are consistent
with the orbital period distribution previously predicted by population
synthesis studies. We propose that WZ Sge stars and CVs with a low
mass-transfer rate are excellent candidates for the missing population
predicted by the evolution theory of CVs.

  Systems","14 pages",,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper presents a methodology and a system, named LogMaster, for mining
correlations of events that have multiple attributions, i.e., node ID,
application ID, event type, and event severity, in logs of large-scale cluster
systems. Different from traditional transactional data, e.g., supermarket
purchases, system logs have their unique characteristic, and hence we propose
several innovative approaches to mine their correlations. We present a simple
metrics to measure correlations of events that may happen interleavedly. On the
basis of the measurement of correlations, we propose two approaches to mine
event correlations; meanwhile, we propose an innovative abstraction: event
correlation graphs (ECGs) to represent event correlations, and present an ECGs
based algorithm for predicting events. For two system logs of a production
Hadoop-based cloud computing system at Research Institution of China Mobile and
a production HPC cluster system at Los Alamos National Lab (LANL), we evaluate
our approaches in three scenarios: (a) predicting all events on the basis of
both failure and non-failure events; (b) predicting only failure events on the
basis of both failure and non-failure events; (c) predicting failure events
after removing non-failure events.

sparse row-column format (CSRC), designed for profiting from the symmetric
non-zero pattern observed in global finite element matrices. Unlike classical
compressed storage formats, performing the sparse matrix-vector product using
the CSRC requires thread-safe access to the destination vector. To avoid race
conditions, we have implemented two partitioning strategies. In the first one,
each thread allocates an array for storing its contributions, which are later
combined in an accumulation step. We analyze how to perform this accumulation
in four different ways. The second strategy employs a coloring algorithm for
grouping rows that can be concurrently processed by threads. Our results
indicate that, although incurring an increase in the working set size, the
former approach leads to the best performance improvements for most matrices.

images are analyzed for a sample of 189 nearby star-forming and starburst

can be defined using the monochromatic infrared dust emission centered at 70
and 160 micron. We compare recently published recipes for SFR measures using
combinations of the 24 micron and observed H-alpha luminosities with those
using 24 micron luminosity alone. From these comparisons, we derive a reference
SFR indicator for use in our analysis. Linear correlations between SFR and the
70 and 160 micron luminosity are found for L(70)>=1.4x10^{42} erg/s and
L(160)>=2x10^{42} erg/s, corresponding to SFR>=0.1-0.3 M_sun/yr. Below those
two luminosity limits, the relation between SFR and 70 micron (160 micron)
luminosity is non-linear and SFR calibrations become problematic. The
dispersion of the data around the mean trend increases for increasing
wavelength, becoming about 25% (factor ~2) larger at 70 (160) micron than at 24
micron. The increasing dispersion is likely an effect of the increasing
contribution to the infrared emission of dust heated by stellar populations not
associated with the current star formation. The non-linear relation between SFR
and the 70 and 160 micron emission at faint galaxy luminosities suggests that
the increasing transparency of the interstellar medium, decreasing effective
dust temperature, and decreasing filling factor of star forming regions across
the galaxy become important factors for decreasing luminosity. The SFR
calibrations are provided for galaxies with oxygen abundance 12+Log(O/H)>8.1.
At lower metallicity the infrared luminosity no longer reliably traces the SFR
because galaxies are less dusty and more transparent.

can be further simplified when the heavy quark limit is taken into

parameters. For single zone synchrotron X-ray emission, we anticipate that
larger values of fx/fr should correlate inversely with the average magnetic
field strength (if the acceleration process is limited by loss time equals
acceleration time). Beamed IC/CMB X-rays should produce larger values of fx/fr
for smaller values of the angle between the jet direction and the line of sight
but will also be affected by the low frequency radio spectral index.

case of polygonal boundary curves in three-dimensional Euclidean space. It
relies on the method developed by Ren\'e Garnier and published in 1928 in a
paper which seems today to be totally forgotten. Garnier's approach is more
geometrical and constructive than the variational one, and it provides minimal
disks without branch point. However, it is sometimes really complicated, and
even obscure or incomplete. Following Garnier's initial ideas, we propose a new
proof, which intends not only to be complete, but also simpler and moderner
than his one. This work mainly relies on a systematic use of Fuchsian systems
and on the relation that we establish between the reality of such systems and
their monodromy. Garnier's method is based on the following fact: using the
spinor Weierstrass representation for minimal surfaces, we can associate a real
Fuchsian second-order equation, defined on the Riemann sphere, with each
minimal disk with a polygonal boundary curve. The monodromy of the equation is
determined by the oriented directions of the edges of the boundary. To solve
the Plateau problem, we are thus led to solve a Riemann-Hilbert problem. We
then proceed in two steps: first, by means of isomonodromic deformations, we
construct and describe the family of all minimal disks with a polygonal
boundary curve of given oriented directions. Then we use this description to
study the edges's lengths of their boundary curves, and we show that every
polygon is the boundary of a minimal disk.

requires extremely small lengths. Here, we show that a single arsenic dopant
dramatically affects the off-state behavior of an advanced microelectronics

materials with a different dielectric constant than the host semiconductor. We
measure a strong enhancement, from 54meV to 108meV, of the ionization energy of
an arsenic atom located near the buried oxide. This enhancement is responsible
for the large current below threshold at room temperature and therefore
explains the large variability in these ultra-scaled transistors. The results
also suggest a path to incorporating quantum functionalities into silicon CMOS

on the warping factor. We show that topological arguments, used by Witten to
constrain central charges for the BTZ black hole, can be generalized to deal

relies on Monte Carlo simulations which are computationally intensive. Using
aggregated wind power in Ireland, we study two approaches of multi-step density
forecasts which can be obtained from simple iterations so that intensive
computations are avoided. In the first approach, we apply a logistic
transformation to normalize the data approximately and describe the transformed
data using ARIMA--GARCH models so that multi-step forecasts can be iterated
easily. In the second approach, we describe the forecast densities by truncated
normal distributions which are governed by two parameters, namely, the
conditional mean and conditional variance. We apply exponential smoothing
methods to forecast the two parameters simultaneously. Since the underlying
model of exponential smoothing is Gaussian, we are able to obtain multi-step
forecasts of the parameters by simple iterations and thus generate forecast
densities as truncated normal distributions. We generate forecasts for wind
power from 15 minutes to 24 hours ahead. Results show that the first approach
generates superior forecasts and slightly outperforms the second approach under
various proper scores. Nevertheless, the second approach is computationally
more efficient and gives more robust results under different lengths of
training data. It also provides an attractive alternative approach since one is
allowed to choose a particular parametric density for the forecasts, and is
valuable when there are no obvious transformations to normalize the data.

This action factors through an explicit profinite group hat GT_ell, which

The existence of elliptic associators enables one to show that the Lie algebra

results: semidirect product structure; explicit generators. This existence also
allows one to compute the Zariski closure of the mapping class group in genus

evolution equation for the probability generating function. Spectral
decomposition then brings about an eigenvalue problem for a non-Hermitian
linear differential operator. The ground-state eigenmode encodes the stationary
distribution of the population size. For long-lived metastable populations
which exhibit extinction or escape to another metastable state, the
quasi-stationary distribution and the mean time to extinction or escape are
encoded by the eigenmode and eigenvalue of the lowest excited state. If the
average population size in the stationary or quasi-stationary state is large,
the corresponding eigenvalue problem can be solved via WKB approximation
amended by other asymptotic methods. We illustrate these ideas in several model

learned as the synaptic weight configuration is modified through a chain of

capacity of $\alpha \approx 0.63$ for pattern length N = 101 and $\alpha

complete discretely valued field. These spaces, which we call uniformly rigid,
may be viewed as classical rigid-analytic spaces together with an additional
uniform structure: On the level of points, a uniformly rigid space coincides
with its underlying rigid space, while its G-topology is coarser and its sheaf
of holomorphic functions is smaller. A uniformly rigid structure is, locally,
induced by an integral formal model of formally finite type. In fact,
Berthelot's generic fiber functor factors naturally through the category of
uniformly rigid spaces. The uniformly rigid generic fiber of a quasi-compact
formal scheme of formally finite type is quasi-compact, and its global
functions are bounded. We construct our new category by starting out from
semi-affinoid algebras and nested rational coverings; we prove a uniformly
rigid acyclicity theorem, and we study coherent modules.

quantum as well as the classical regimes. Probably our Universe has arisen as a
vacuum fluctuation and very probably that it has had a high symmetry for
Planckian parameters. Besides, vacuum energy density has to be a positive one.
In the early epochs during its cooling the Universe had been losing the high
symmetry by phase transitions since condensates of quantum fields carried
negative contributions (78 orders) to its positive energy density. It was the
period of the Universe evolution during the first parts of the first second of
its life. After the last phase transition (quark-hadron) the vacuum energy `has
hardened'. In this moment its energy density can be calculated using the
Zeldovich's formula inserting an average value of the pseudo-Goldstone boson
masses (pi-mesons) that characterizes this chromodynamical vacuum. The chiral
symmetry was then lost. Dynamics of the equilibrium vacuum after its `hardness'
is considered by applying the holographic conception. In this case the Universe
has been losing vacuum energy (45 orders) on organization of new quantum states
during 13.76 x 10^9 years. Using this conception we can get solution of the
cosmological constant problem. 123 crisis orders problem may be resolved. The
density of vacuum energy cannot have a constant value in principle because of
the new quantum states are organized during expansion of the Universe but the
equation of state vacuum w= - 1 should be naturally constant. The density of
vacuum energy from z=0 up to z=10^11 is also calculated in the classical regime
of the Universe evolution.

roughly speaking, the nucleus of an atom becomes (linearly) larger than the
whole atom. Precisely, we consider Helium ion (in the ground state of the
electron) moving translationally with the speed much smaller than speed of the
electron rotation. This translation, effectively, changes neither the total
momentum, nor the de Broglie wave length of the electron, nor the linear size
of the atom corresponding to the diameter of the electron orbit. But, this
translation implies a small nucleus momentum and nuclear de Broglie wavelength
almost hundred times larger than the electron de Broglie wavelength. In the
measurement of the nucleus wavelength using a diffraction apparatus with a
characteristic length constant proportional to the proposed nucleus wavelength,
according to standard quantum mechanical formalism, the nucleus behaves
practically certainly as a wave. Then the unique, irreducible linear
characteristic size for such a nucleus is de Broglie wavelength. Such a
measurement effectively influences neither the electron dynamics nor linear
size of the atom. This implies that, in such measurement, the size of the
nucleus is in one dimension larger than the whole atom, i.e. electron orbital.
All this corresponds metaphorically to the famous Leonardo fresco ""Last Supper""

cause an expanding ""superposition"" or dramatic wave-like movement of the

fibre bundles is established and investigated in order to find a geometric
formulation of classical gauge theories on noncommutative space-times. As a
generalization, the notion of deformation quantization of surjective
submersions is also discussed.
  It is shown that deformation quantizations of surjective submersions and
principal fibre bundles always exist and are unique up to equivalence. These
statements concerning complex-valued functions are moreover formulated and
proved for sections of arbitrary vector bundles over the total space, in
particular equivariant vector bundles. The commutants of the deformed right
module structures within the differential operators, playing an inportant role
with regard to the infinitesimal gauge transformations, are computed explicitly
in each case. Depending on the choice of specific covariant derivatives and
connections the commutants are isomorphic to the formal power series of the
respective vertical differential operators which thus inherit a deformation of
the algebra structure. The resulting deformed bimodules are again unique up to
equivalence. With respect to further applications it is finally shown that
every deformation quantization of a principal fibre bundle induces a
deformation quantization of any associated vector bundle.

interferometry using Josephson junctions as phase-sensitive detectors. We
introduce a single Abrikosov vortex into a superconducting lead with a detector
junction made at the edge of the lead. We observe that the vortex induces a
Josephson phase shift equal to the polar angle of the vortex within the
junction length. When the vortex is close to the junction it induces a pi-step
in the Josephson phase difference, leading to a controllable and reversible
switching of the junction into the 0 - pi state. This in turn results in an
unusual Phi_0/2 quantization of the flux in the junction. The vortex may hence
act as a tunable ""phase battery"" for quantum electronics.

topological, AB-phase would seem to break gauge invariance. Wick, Wightman and
Wigner argued that since (global) charge-dependent phase transformations are
physically unobservable, charge state superpositions are unphysical (`charge

way. However, Aharonov and Susskind disputed this superselection rule: they
distinguished between such global charge-dependent transformations, and
transformations of the relative inter-charge phases of two particles, and
showed that the latter \emph{could} in principle be observable! Finally, the

role in allergy and during allergen-specific immunotherapy. We have extended
our previous mathematical model describing the nonlinear dynamics of Th1-Th2
regulation by including Treg cells and their major cytokines. We hypothesize
that immunotherapy mainly acts on the T cell level and that the decisive
process can be regarded as a dynamical phenomenon. The model consists of
nonlinear differential equations which describe the proliferation and mutual
suppression of different T cell subsets. The old version of the model was based
upon the Th1-Th2 paradigm and is successful in describing the ""Th1-Th2 switch""
which was considered the decisive event during specific immunotherapy. In
recent years, however, the Th1-Th2 paradigm has been questioned and therefore,
we have investigated a modified model in order to account for the influence of
a regulatory T cell type. We examined the extended model by means of numerical
simulations and analytical methods. As the modified model is more complex, we
had to develop new methods to portray its characteristics. The concept of
stable manifolds of fixed points of a stroboscobic map turned out to be
especially important. We found that when including regulatory T cells, our
model can describe the events in allergen-specific immunotherapy more
accurately. Our results suggest that the decisive effect of immunotherapy, the
increased proliferation of Treg and suppression of Th2 cells, crucially depends
on the administration of high dose injections right before the maintenance
phase sets in. Empirical protocols could therefore be improved by optimizing
this step of therapy.

the source compactness, and the compactness variability. A detailed analysis of

relative to their mean values, with variations in the session-to-session flux
density scale being less than 10%, (3) sources were found to be more compact
with less intrinsic structure at higher frequencies, and (4) variations of the

resonant neutron one-particle levels in nuclei towards the neutron drip line
are exhibited. It is shown that the shell-structure change due to the weak
binding may lead to the deformation of those nuclei with the neutron numbers $N
\approx$ 8, 20, 28 and 40, which are known to be magic numbers in stable
nuclei. Nuclei in the ""island of inversion"" are most easily and in a simple
manner understood in terms of deformation. As an example of spectroscopic
properties other than single-particle energies, magnetic moments of some
weakly-bound possibly deformed odd-N nuclei with neutron numbers close to those
traditional magic numbers are given, which are calculated using the wave
function of the last odd particle in deformed Woods-Saxon potentials.

  (COCOSYS-09)",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) is a challenging area of research
due to its importance to variety of commercial applications. The overall
problem may be subdivided into two key modules, firstly, localization of
license plates from vehicle images, and secondly, optical character recognition
of extracted license plates. In the current work, we have concentrated on the
first part of the problem, i.e., localization of license plate regions from
Indian commercial vehicles as a significant step towards development of a
complete ALPR system for Indian vehicles. The technique is based on color based
segmentation of vehicle images and identification of potential license plate
regions. True license plates are finally localized based on four spatial and
horizontal contrast features. The technique successfully localizes the actual
license plates in 73.4% images.

Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) are of great importance for cosmology. In
previous work we had developed a pipeline for map-making independently of the
WMAP team. The new maps produced from the WMAP raw data by our pipeline are
notably different to the official ones, and the power spectrum as well as the
best-fit cosmological parameters are significantly different too. What's more,
by revealing the inconsistency between the WMAP raw data and their official
map, we had pointed out that there must exist an unexpected problem in the WMAP
team's pipeline. In this work, we find that the trouble comes from the
inaccuracy of antenna pointing direction caused by a systematical time drift
between the attitude data and the science data in the WMAP raw time-order data
(TOD). The CMB quadrupole in the WMAP release can be exactly generated from a
differential dipole field which is completely determined by the spacecraft
velocity and the antenna directions without using any CMB signal. After
correcting the WMAP team's error, the CMB quadrupole component disappears.
Therefore, the released WMAP CMB quadrupole is almost completely artificial and
the real quadrupole of the CMB anisotropy should be near zero. Our finding is
important for understanding the early universe.

standing wave lattice beyond the internal dynamics are investigated. Based on a
simple effective model, we identify a diversity of dynamic regimes of atomic
motion by periodically adjusting the lattice depth. Harmonic oscillation or
pendulum rotation with classical step-jumping, random scattering walking,
chaotic transportation, quasi-periodic trapped motion and roughly ballistic
free flying are found in this simple model within different parametric regions
by approximate analyses. Our study demonstrates a complex motion of single atom
in modulating optical lattice beyond the quantum description.

other existing strategies (C^1 elements, adaptive mesh refinement, multigrid
resolution, etc). Beyond the classical benchmarks, a numerical study has been
carried out to investigate the influence of a polynomial approximation of the
logarithmic free energy and the bifurcations near the first eigenvalue of the
Laplace operator.
