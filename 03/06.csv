(GHs) on Mpc scales or minihalos (MHs) on smaller scales. Comparing VLA and XMM
radial profiles of several such clusters, we find a universal linear
correlation between radio and X-ray surface brightness, valid in both types of
halos. It implies a halo central emissivity
nu*j_nu=10^{-31.4+-0.2}*(n/10^-2cm^-3)^2*(T/T_0)^{0.2+-0.5} erg/s/cm^3, where T
and T_0 are the local and central temperatures, and n is the electron number
density. We argue that the tight correlation and the scaling of j_nu, combined
with morphological and spectral evidence, indicate that both GHs and MHs arise
from secondary electrons and positrons, produced in cosmic-ray ion (CRI)
collisions with a strongly magnetized, B >3 muG intracluster gas. When the
magnetic energy density drops below that of the microwave background, the radio
emission weakens considerably, producing halos with a clumpy morphology (e.g.
RXCJ2003.5-2323 and A2255) or a distinct radial break. We thus measure a
magnetic field B=3 muG at a radius r~110 kpc in A2029 and r~50 kpc in Perseus.
The spectrum of secondaries, produced from hadronic collisions of ~20 GeV CRIs,
reflects the energy dependence of the collision cross section. We use the
observed spectra of halos, in particular where they steepen with increasing
radius or frequency, to (i) measure B~10(nu/700 MHz) muG, with nu the spectral
break frequency; (ii) identify a correlation between the average spectrum and
the central magnetic field; and (iii) infer a CRI spectral index s <-2.7 and
energy fraction xi_p~10^{-3.6+-0.2} at particle energies above 10 GeV. Our
results favor a model where CRIs diffuse away from their sources (which are
probably supernovae, according to a preliminary correlation with star
formation), whereas the magnetic fields are generated by mergers in GHs and by
core sloshing in MHs.

galactic nuclei, is believed to arise from relativistically shocked
collisionless plasmas. Such sources often exhibit highly transient spectra
evolving rapidly, compared with source lifetimes. Radiation emitted from these
sources is typically associated with non-linear plasma physics, complex field
topologies and non-thermal particle distributions. In such circumstances a
standard synchrotron paradigm may fail to produce accurate conclusions
regarding the underlying physics. Simulating spectral emission and spectral
evolution numerically in various relativistic shock scenarios is then the only
viable method to determine the detailed physical origin of the emitted spectra.
In this Letter we present synthetic radiation spectra representing the early
stage development of the filamentation (streaming) instability of an initially
unmagnetized plasma, which is relevant for both collisionless shock formation
and reconnection dynamics in relativistic astrophysical outflows, as well as
for laboratory astrophysics experiments. Results were obtained using a highly
efficient ""in situ"" diagnostics method, based on detailed particle-in-cell
modeling of collisionless plasmas. The synthetic spectra obtained here are
compared with those predicted by a semi-analytical model for jitter radiation
from the filamentation instability, the latter including self-consistent
generated field topologies and particle distributions obtained from the
simulations reported upon here. Spectra exhibit dependence on the presence - or
absence - of an inert plasma constituent, when comparing baryonic plasmas (i.e.
containing protons) with pair plasmas. The results also illustrate that
considerable care should be taken when using lower-dimensional models to obtain

Hence the gravitational field of the Earth is inhomogeneous, and possesses a
tidal component. The free fall of an extended quantum object such as a hydrogen
atom prepared in a high principal-quantum-number stretch state, i.e., a
circular Rydberg atom, is predicted to fall more slowly that a classical
point-like object, when both objects are dropped from the same height from
above the Earth. This indicates that, apart from ""quantum jumps,"" the atom
exhibits a kind of ""quantum incompressibility"" during free fall in
inhomogeneous, tidal gravitational fields like those of the Earth. A
superconducting ring-like system with a persistent current circulating around
it behaves like the circular Rydberg atom during free fall. Like the electronic
wavefunction of the freely falling atom, the Cooper-pair wavefunction is
""quantum incompressible."" The ions of the ionic lattice of the superconductor,
however, are not ""quantum incompressible,"" since they do not possess a globally
coherent quantum phase. The resulting difference during free fall in the
response of the nonlocalizable Cooper pairs of electrons and the localizable
ions to inhomogeneous gravitational fields is predicted to lead to a charge
separation effect, which in turn leads to a large repulsive Coulomb force that
opposes the convergence caused by the tidal, attractive gravitational force on
the superconducting system. A ""Cavendish-like"" experiment is proposed for
observing the charge separation effect induced by inhomogeneous gravitational
fields in a superconducting circuit. This experiment would demonstrate the
existence of a novel coupling between gravity and electricity via

molecular-orbital (MO) theory for extended quasi-linear molecular

envelope-function approximation widely employed in solid-state physics, leads
to a mapping of the three-dimensional single-particle eigenvalue equations into
simple one-dimensional hole and electron Schr\""odinger-like equations with
piecewise-constant effective potentials and masses. The eigenfunctions of these
equations are envelope MO's in which the short-wavelength oscillations present
in the full MO's, associated with the atomistic details of the molecular

calculating the envelope MO's of high-lying occupied and low-lying virtual
$\pi$ states in prototypical nanometric heterostructures constituted by
oligomers of polyacetylene and polydiacetylene. Comparison with atomistic
electronic-structure calculations reveals that the envelope-MO energies agree
very well with the energies of the $\pi$ MO's and that the envelope MO's
describe precisely the long-wavelength variations of the $\pi$ MO's. This
envelope MO theory, which is generalizable to extended systems of any

the third region confirmed to show methanol maser emission at this frequency.
The brighter 23.1-GHz spot coincides in position with a rare formaldehyde

theories holographically dual to 4+1 dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons
theory undergo a quantum phase transition in the presence of a finite charge
density and magnetic field. The quantum critical theory has dynamical scaling
exponent z=3, and is reached by tuning a relevant operator of scaling dimension
2. For magnetic field B above the critical value B_c, the system behaves as a
Fermi liquid. As the magnetic field approaches B_c from the high field side,
the specific heat coefficient diverges as 1/(B-B_c), and non-Fermi liquid
behavior sets in. For B<B_c the entropy density s becomes non-vanishing at zero
temperature, and scales according to s \sim \sqrt{B_c - B}. At B=B_c, and for
small non-zero temperature T, a new scaling law sets in for which s\sim
T^{1/3}. Throughout a small region surrounding the quantum critical point, the
ratio s/T^{1/3} is given by a universal scaling function which depends only on
the ratio (B-B_c)/T^{2/3}.
  The quantum phase transition involves non-analytic behavior of the specific
heat and magnetization but no change of symmetry. Above the critical field, our
numerical results are consistent with those predicted by the Hertz/Millis
theory applied to metamagnetic quantum phase transitions, which also describe
non-analytic changes in magnetization without change of symmetry. Such
transitions have been the subject of much experimental investigation recently,
especially in the compound Sr_3 Ru_2 O_7, and we comment on the connections.

Eigen's error threshold. Presumably, enzymatic replication can maintain higher
complexity, but in a competitive environment such a replicator is faced with
two problems related to its twofold role as enzyme and substrate: as enzyme, it
should replicate itself rather than wastefully copy non-functional substrates,
and as substrate it should preferably be replicated by superior enzymes instead
of less-efficient mutants. Because specific recognition can enforce these
propensities, we thoroughly analyze an idealized quasispecies model for
enzymatic replication, with replication rates that are either a decreasing
(self-specific) or increasing (cross-specific) function of the Hamming distance
between the recognition or ""tag"" sequences of enzyme and substrate. We find
that very weak self-specificity suffices to localize a population about a
master sequence and thus to preserve its information, while simultaneous
localization about complementary sequences in the cross-specific case is more
challenging. A surprising result is that stronger specificity constraints allow
longer recognition sequences, because the populations are better localized.
Extrapolating from experimental data, we obtain rough quantitative estimates
for the maximal length of the recognition or tag sequence that can be used to
reliably discriminate appropriate and infeasible enzymes and substrates,
respectively.

controlled by varying the thickness of the top Pd layer over a range from 8 A

embedded Fe layer moves closer to the top surface, the saturated magnetization
normalized to area and the Curie temperature decrease whereas the coercivity
increases. These thickness-dependent observations for proximity-polarized
thin-film Pd are qualitatively consistent with finite size effects that are
well known for regular thin-film ferromagnets. The critical exponent $\beta$ of
the order parameter (magnetization) is found to approach the mean field value

responsible for the flux of mass in the stationary state, is strongly
universal: its scaling exponent is given by the mean field value independent of
the spatial dimension and independent of the value of beta. Finally we study
numerically the two point spatial correlation function which characterises the
structure of the depletion zone around heavy particles in the diffusion limited

fractional power of the separation between particles as this separation goes to
zero. We provide a scaling argument for the value of this exponent which is in

prototypical GLSB galaxies: Malin 1 and NGC 7589. We re-analysed existing HI
observations and derived new rotation curves, which were used to investigate
the distributions of luminous and dark matter in these galaxies.
  In contrast to previous findings, the rotation curves of both galaxies show a
steep rise in the central parts, typical of high surface brightness (HSB)
systems. Mass decompositions with a dark matter halo show that baryons may
dominate the dynamics of the inner regions. Indeed, a ""maximum disk"" fit gives
stellar mass-to-light ratios in the range of values typically found for HSB
galaxies.
  These results, together with other recent studies, suggest that GLSB galaxies
are systems with a double structure: an inner HSB early-type spiral galaxy and
an outer extended LSB disk.

reproduced well, whereas Malin 1 represents a challenging test for the theory.

magneto-hydrodynamics that are needed to understand the nature of solar
magnetic fields. One key-ingredient to understand the behavior of solar
magnetic field is the process of flux emergence into the solar photosphere, and
how the magnetic flux reorganizes to form the magnetic phenomena of active
regions like sunspots and pores. Here, we present a spectropolarimetric and
imaging data set from a region of emerging magnetic flux, in which a proto-spot
without penumbra forms a penumbra. During the formation of the penumbra the
area and the magnetic flux of the spot increases. First results of our data
analysis demonstrate that the additional magnetic flux, which contributes to
the increasing area of the penumbra, is supplied by the region of emerging
magnetic flux. We observe emerging bipoles that are aligned such that the spot
polarity is closer to the spot. As an emerging bipole separates, the pole of
the spot polarity migrates towards the spot, and finally merges with it. We
speculate that this is a fundamental process, which makes the sunspot
accumulate magnetic flux. As more and more flux is accumulated a penumbra forms
and transforms the proto-spot into a fully-fledged sunspot.

interpolator of the observed data. Realizations of Gaussian spatial processes
(GP) are commonly used to model such simulator outputs. Fitting a GP model to
$n$ data points requires the computation of the inverse and determinant of $n

unstable due to near-singularity of $R$. This happens if any pair of design
points are very close together in the input space. The popular approach to
overcome near-singularity is to introduce a small nugget (or jitter) parameter
in the model that is estimated along with other model parameters. The inclusion
of a nugget in the model often causes unnecessary over-smoothing of the data.

We use a Gomory-Hu tree to represent all the pairwise min cuts implicitly.
Previously, no subquadratic time algorithm was known for this problem. Since
all-pairs min cut and the minimum cycle basis are dual problems in planar
graphs, we also obtain an implicit representation of a minimum cycle basis in
$O(n\log^4n)$ time and $O(n\log n)$ space. Additionally, an explicit
representation can be obtained in $O(C)$ time and space where $C$ is the size
of the basis.
  These results require that shortest paths are unique. This can be guaranteed
either by using randomization without overhead, or deterministically with an
additional $\log^2 n$ factor in the preprocessing times.

hyperpolarizability of a one-dimensional quantum system. These studies were
used to suggest properties of one-dimensional organic molecules, such as the
degree of modulation of conjugation, that could potentially be adjusted to
improve the nonlinear-optical response. However, there were no conditions set
on the optimized potential energy function to ensure that the resulting
energies were consistent with what is observed in real molecules. Furthermore,
the system was placed into a one-dimensional box with infinite walls, forcing
the wavefunctions to vanish at the ends of the molecule. In the present work,
the walls are separated by a distance much larger than the molecule's length;
and, the variations of the potential energy function are restricted to levels
that are more typical of a real molecule. In addition to being a more
physically-reasonable model, our present approach better approximates the bound
states and approximates the continuum states - which are usually ignored. We
find that the same universal properties continue to be important for optimizing
the nonlinear-optical response, though the details of the wavefunctions differ
from previous result.

find that in most of the single field inflationary models the mean square gauge
invariant inflaton fluctuation grows {\em faster} than any test field with a
non-negative effective mass. Hybrid inflationary models can be an exception:
the mean square of a test field can dominate over the gauge invariant inflaton
fluctuation one on suitably choosing parameters. We also compute the stochastic
growth of quantum fluctuation of a second field, relaxing the assumption of its
zero homogeneous value, in a generic inflationary model; as a main result, we
obtain that the equation of motion of a gauge invariant variable associated,
order by order, with a generic quantum scalar fluctuation during inflation can
be obtained only if we use the number of e-folds as the time variable in the

and a pure hard core potential. The limit of a pure hard core potential are
compared with results for a spinless Bose and Fermi gas. The limit of many
partial waves for a pure hard core interaction is also considered and result in
expressions involving the hard core volume. This feature arises from a scaling
relation similar to that for hard sphere scattering with diffractive
corrections. The role of underlying isospin symmetries associated with the
strong interaction of protons and neutrons in this two component model is
investigated. Properties are studied with varying proton fraction. An analytic
expression for the Beth Uhlenbeck continuum integral is developed which closely
approximates exact results based on the potential model considered. An analysis
of features associated with a unitary limit is given. In the unitary limit of
very large scattering length, the ratio of effective range to thermal
wavelength appears as a limiting scale. Thermodynamic quantities such as the
entropy and compressibility are also developed. The effective range corrections
to the entropy vary as the cube of this ratio for low temperatures and are

reliability of that tracer has long been questioned in environments different
from the Milky Way. We study the relationship between H2 and CO abundances
using a fully dynamical model of magnetized turbulence coupled to a chemical
network simplified to follow only the dominant pathways for H2 and CO formation
and destruction, and including photodissociation using a six-ray approximation.
We find that the abundance of H2 is primarily determined by the amount of time
available for its formation, which is proportional to the product of the
density and the metallicity, but insensitive to photodissociation.
Photodissociation only becomes important at extinctions under a few tenths of a
visual magnitude, in agreement with both observational and prior theoretical
work. On the other hand, CO forms quickly, within a dynamical time, but its
abundance depends primarily on photodissociation, with only a weak secondary
dependence on H2 abundance. As a result, there is a sharp cutoff in CO
abundance at mean visual extinctions A_V < 3. At lower values of A_V we find
that the ratio of H2 column density to CO emissivity X_CO is proportional to
A_V^(-3.5). This explains the discrepancy observed in low metallicity systems
between cloud masses derived from CO observations and other techniques such as
infrared emission. Our work predicts that CO-bright clouds in low metallicity
systems should be systematically larger or denser than Milky Way clouds, or
both. Our results further explain the narrow range of observed molecular cloud
column densities as a threshold effect, without requiring the assumption of

which have been classified by Winitzki. According to Winitzki's classification
these phases can be characterized by the topology of the percolating structures
in the inflating, ""white,"" region. In this paper we discuss these phases, the
transitions between them, and the way they are seen by a ""Census Taker""; a
hypothetical observer inside the non-inflating, ""black,"" region. We discuss
three phases that we call, ""black island,"" ""tubular,"" and ""white island."" The
black island phase is familiar, comprised of rare Coleman De Luccia bubble
nucleation events. The Census Taker sees an essentially spherical boundary,
described by the conformal field theory of the FRW/CFT correspondence. In the
tubular phase the Census Taker sees a complicated infinite genus structure
composed of arbitrarily long tubes. The white island phase is even more
mysterious from the black side. Surprisingly, when viewed from the
non-inflating region this phase resembles a closed, positively curved universe
which eventually collapses to a singularity. Nevertheless, pockets of eternal
inflation continue forever. In addition there is an ""aborted"" phase in which no
eternal inflation takes place. Rigorous results of Chayes, Chayes, Grannan and
Swindle establish the existence of all of these phases, separated by first
order transitions, in Mandelbrot percolation, a simple model of eternal
inflation.

on Euclidean projections which converges in $O(1/\sqrt{\epsilon})$ iterations
on strongly convex functions. Unfortunately when applied to \mcn s, this
approach does not admit graphical model factorization which, as in many
existing algorithms, is crucial for keeping the cost per iteration tractable.

Bregman projections which admits graphical model factorization naturally, and

(N_J=8_9-7_8). SiO, CO, and SO can all be a good tracer of the HH 211 jet,
tracing the internal shocks in the jet. Although the emissions of these
molecules show roughly the same morphology of the jet, there are detailed
differences. In particular, the CO emission traces the jet closer to the source
than the SiO and SO emissions. In addition, in the better resolved internal
shocks, both the CO and SO emission are seen slightly ahead of the SiO
emission. The jet is clearly seen on both sides of the source with more than
one cycle of wiggle. The wiggle is reflection-symmetric about the source and
can be reasonably fitted by an orbiting source jet model. The best-fit
parameters suggest that the source itself could be a very low-mass protobinary
with a total mass of ~ 60 M_Jup and a binary separation of ~ 4.6 AU. The
abundances of SiO and SO in the gas phase are found to be highly enhanced in
the jet as compared to the quiescent molecular clouds, even close to within 300
AU from the source where the dynamical time scale is <10 yrs. The abundance
enhancements of these molecules are closely related to the internal shocks. The
detected SiO is either the consequence of the release of Si-bearing material
from dust grains or of its formation via gas chemistry in the shocks. The SO,
on the other hand, seems to form via gas chemistry in the shocks.

approaches the gravitational radius (event horizon) of the mass, but never
crosses it within a finite time for an external observer. Based upon our recent
publication on the problem of gravitational collapse in the physical universe
for an external observer, the following results are reported here: (1) Matter
can indeed fall across the event horizon within a finite time and thus BHs,
rather than ""frozen stars"", are formed in gravitational collapse in the
physical universe. (2) Matter fallen into an astrophysical black hole can never
arrive at the exact center; the exact interior distribution of matter depends
upon the history of the collapse process. Therefore gravitational singularity
does not exist in the physical universe. (3) The metric at any radius is
determined by the global distribution of matter, i.e., not only by the matter
inside the given radius, even in a spherically symmetric and pressureless
gravitational system. This is qualitatively different from the Newtonian
gravity and the common (mis)understanding of the Birkhoff's Theorem. This
result does not contract the ""Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi"" solution for an external

problem of finding the ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic and superconducting
symmetry broken solutions of the correlated lattice fermion models was
discussed within the irreducible Green functions method. A unified scheme for
the construction of generalized mean fields (elastic scattering corrections)
and self-energy (inelastic scattering) in terms of the Dyson equation was
generalized in order to include the source fields. The interrelation of the
Bogoliubov's idea of quasiaverages and the concepts of symmetry breaking and
quantum protectorate was discussed briefly in the context of quantum
statistical physics. The idea of quantum protectorate reveals the essential
difference in the behaviour of the complex many-body systems at the low-energy
and high-energy scales. It was shown that the role of symmetry (and the
breaking of symmetries) in combination with the degeneracy of the system was
reanalyzed and essentially clarified within the framework of the method of
quasiaverages. The complementary notion of quantum protectorate might provide

link weights can achieve throughput optimality in wireless networks. In
particular, a key result by Rajagopalan, Shah, and Shin (2009) shows that, if
the link weights are chosen to be of the form log(log(q)) (where q is the
queue-length), then throughput optimality is achieved. In this paper, we
tighten their result by showing that throughput optimality is preserved even
with weight functions of the form log(q)/g(q), where g(q) can be a function
that increases arbitrarily slowly. The significance of the result is due to the
fact that weight functions of the form log(q)/g(q) seem to achieve the best
delay performance in practice.

starting with a review of the concepts underpinning the framework and the
circumstances under which it is expected to be useful. A particular emphasis is
placed on the intuitive picture provided for both renormalization in quantum
field theory and universality associated with second order phase transitions. A
qualitative discussion of triviality, asymptotic freedom and asymptotic safety
is presented.
  Focusing on scalar field theory, the construction of assorted flow equations
is considered using a general approach, whereby different ERGs follow from
field redefinitions. It is recalled that Polchinski's equation can be cast as a
heat equation, which provides intuition and computational techniques for what
follows. The analysis of properties of exact solutions to flow equations
includes a proof that the spectrum of the anomalous dimension at critical
fixed-points is quantized.
  Two alternative methods for computing the beta-function in lambda phi^4
theory are considered. For one of these it is found that all explicit
dependence on the non-universal differences between a family of ERGs cancels
out, exactly. The Wilson-Fisher fixed-point is rediscovered in a rather novel
way.
  The discussion of nonperturbative approximation schemes focuses on the
derivative expansion, and includes a refinement of the arguments that, at the
lowest order in this approximation, a function can be constructed which
decreases monotonically along the flow.
  A new perspective is provided on the relationship between the
renormalizability of the Wilsonian effective action and of correlation
functions, following which the construction of manifestly gauge invariant ERGs
is sketched, and some new insights are given. Drawing these strands together
suggests a new approach to quantum field theory.

study the phenomena of spin-charge separation in conjugated polymers (materials
for molecular electronics and spintronics), which have long-range
electron-electron interactions and belong to the class of strongly correlated
low-dimensional many-body systems. The issue of real time dynamics within the
Pariser-Parr-Pople (PPP) model which includes long-range electron correlations
has not been addressed in the literature so far. The present study on PPP
chains has revealed that, (i) long-range electron correlations enable both the
charge and spin degree of freedom of the electron, to propagate faster in the
PPP model compared to Hubbard model, (ii) for standard parameters of the PPP
model as applied to conjugated polymers, the charge velocity is almost twice
that of the spin velocity and, (iii) the simplistic interpretation of
long-range correlations by merely renormalizing the {\it U} value of the
Hubbard model fails to explain the dynamics of doped holes/electrons in the PPP
model.

induced during the interaction of disk galaxies. This inflow of relatively
low-metallicity gas dilutes the metallicity of the circumnuclear gas. We have
investigated several aspects of the process as the timing and duration of the
dilution and its correlation with the induced star formation. We analysed major
(1:1) gas-rich interactions and mergers, spanning a range of initial orbital
characteristics. Star formation and metal enrichment from SNe are included in
our model. Our results show that the strongest trend is between the star
formation rate and the dilution of the metals in the nuclear region; i.e., the
more intense the central burst of star formation, the more the gas is diluted.
This trend comes from strong inflows of relatively metal-poor gas from the
outer regions of both disks, which fuels the intense star formation and lowers
the overall metallicity for a time. The strong inflows happen on timescales of
about 10^8 years or less, and the most intense star formation and lowest gas
phase metallicities are seen generally after the first pericentre passage. As
the star formation proceeds and the merger advances, the dilution reduces and
enrichment becomes dominant - ultimately increasing the metallicity of the
circumnuclear gas to a level higher than the initial metallicities of the
merging galaxies. The ""fly-bys"" - pairs that interact but do not merge - also
cause some dilution. We even see some dilution early in the merger or in the
""fly-bys"" and thus do not observe a strong trend between the nuclear
metallicities and separation in our simulations until the merger is well
advanced. We also analyse the O and Fe enrichment of the ISM, and show that the
evolution of the alpha/Fe ratios, as well as the dilution of the central gas
metallicity, can be used as a clock for ""dating"" the interaction.

thermodynamic parameters of the flux tube embedded in the atmosphere from the
observed Stokes profiles. Spectro-polarimetric observations of the quiet Sun at
the disk center were performed with the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) on board
Hinode with Fe I 630.2 nm lines. Using repetitive scans with a cadence of 130
s, we first detect the horizontal field that appears inside a granule, near its
edge. On the second scan, vertical fields with positive and negative polarities
appear at both ends of the horizontal field. Then, the horizontal field
disappears leaving the bipolar vertical magnetic fields. The results from the
inversion of the Stokes spectra clearly point to the existence of a flux tube
with magnetic field strength of $\sim400$ G rising through the line forming
layer of the Fe I 630.2 nm lines. The flux tube is located at around
$\log\tau_{500} \sim0$ at $\Delta t$=0 s and around $\log\tau_{500} \sim-1.7$
at $\Delta t$=130 s. At $\Delta t$=260 s the horizontal part is already above
the line forming region of the analyzed lines. The observed Doppler velocity is
maximally 3 km s$^{-1}$, consistent with the upward motion of the structure as
retrieved from the SIRGAUS code. The vertical size of the tube is smaller than
the thickness of the line forming layer. The THMF has a clear
$\Omega$-shaped-loop structure with the apex located near the edge of a
granular cell. The magnetic flux carried by this THMF is estimated to be
$3.1\times10^{17}$ Mx.

studied by employing the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) as a scaling
method to quantify long-range temporal correlations. These studies revealed
that seismic electric signals (SES) activities exhibit a scale invariant
feature with an exponent $\alpha_{DFA} \approx 1$ over all scales investigated
(around five orders of magnitude). Here, we study what happens upon significant
data loss, which is a question of primary practical importance, and show that
the DFA applied to the natural time representation of the remaining data still
reveals for SES activities an exponent close to 1.0, which markedly exceeds the
exponent found in artificial (man-made) noises. This, in combination with
natural time analysis, enables the identification of a SES activity with
probability 75% even after a significant (70%) data loss. The probability
increases to 90% or larger for 50% data loss.

issue which should be resolved for practical applications in nonvolatile

current, Icomp, can work as a crucial parameter to reduce IR. Doping with Co or
Mn can significantly reduce the leakage current in capacitors made using SrTiOx
film, opening a larger operation window for Icomp. By decreasing Icomp with
acceptor doping, we could reduce IR in SrTiOx films by a factor of
approximately 20. Our work suggests that the decrease of Icomp by carrier
doping could be a viable alternative for reducing IR in unipolar resistance
switching.

the influence of a mutually repellent pair potential. The particle density
$\rho\in (0,\infty)$ is kept fixed. Our main result is the identification of
the limiting free energy, $f(\beta,\rho)$, at positive temperature $1/\beta$,
in terms of an explicit variational formula, for any fixed $\rho$ if $\beta$ is
sufficiently small, and for any fixed $\beta$ if $\rho$ is sufficiently small.
The thermodynamic equilibrium is described by the symmetrized trace of
$e^{-\beta {\mathcal{H}}_N}$, where ${\mathcal{H}}_N$ denotes the corresponding
Hamilton operator. The well-known Feynman--Kac formula reformulates this trace
in terms of $N$ interacting Brownian bridges. Due to the symmetrization, the
bridges are organized in an ensemble of cycles of various lengths. The novelty
of our approach is a description in terms of a marked Poisson point process
whose marks are the cycles. This allows for an asymptotic analysis of the
system via a large-deviations analysis of the stationary empirical field. The
resulting variational formula ranges over random shift-invariant marked point
fields and optimizes the sum of the interaction and the relative entropy with
respect to the reference process. In our proof of the lower bound for the free
energy, we drop all interaction involving ""infinitely long"" cycles, and their
possible presence is signalled by a loss of mass of the ""finitely long"" cycles
in the variational formula. In the proof of the upper bound, we only keep the
mass on the ""finitely long"" cycles. We expect that the precise relationship
between these two bounds lies at the heart of Bose--Einstein condensation and
intend to analyze it further in future.
